For as long as she could remember, Maya had wanted nothing more than to meet her soulmate and discover the words that were etched into her skin from birth. Everywhere around her, people were finding their other halves and experiencing joy that she could only imagine. So when her 18th birthday finally arrived, she was filled with an excitement that bordered on desperation.

Maya had always been a bit of a loner, preferring the company of books to people. But now, she knew that it was time to put herself out there and seek her soulmate. After all, the words that had been imprinted on her provided a roadmap to her truest love, and she couldn't waste any more time in finding them.

She took to social media, posting messages on every forum and dating app in existence. Every time her phone buzzed with a new notification, her heart leapt in her chest, hoping against hope that this would be the one. But day after day, week after week, she was met with nothing but silence.

It wasn't until months had passed that Maya finally got a message that made her heart skip a beat. It was short and to the point, but it was enough to send her head spinning: "Meet me at the park, sundown". It was signed with a single initial, "J".

Maya spent the rest of the day in a frenzy, trying on every outfit she owned, doing her hair and makeup until she was sure she looked her best. When she finally stepped out into the cool evening air, she was nervous beyond belief. What if this was a prank? What if her soulmate didn't show?

But then she saw him, standing at the edge of the park with a wry smile on his face. He was tall and thin, with dark hair that spilled over his forehead. He was dressed in black, like he'd just come from a funeral. But when he looked at Maya, his eyes lit up like fireworks.

"Hi," he said, stepping closer. "You're Maya, right?"

She nodded, unable to speak.

"I'm J," he said, taking her hand. "I'm sorry if that message was a bit cryptic. I wanted to make sure you'd show up."

Maya felt a shiver run up her spine as J's words registered in her mind. This was the moment she'd been waiting for, the moment when she would finally discover the words that had been etched into her skin since birth.

Without missing a beat, J reached out and traced his finger along the inside of Maya's wrist, where the letters had been inked in delicate script. She held her breath, waiting for him to speak.

His voice was soft and gentle as he read the words aloud: "The world is a brighter place because you're in it."

Maya felt tears prick at the corners of her eyes as she heard the words that were meant for her and her alone. It was like a weight had been lifted from her shoulders, and she felt lighter than air.

As she looked up at J, she knew that he was the one she had been waiting for, the missing piece to her puzzle. And it wasn't just because of his words – it was the way he looked at her, the way he spoke, the way he made her feel.

Over the next few weeks, Maya and J spent every moment they could together. They explored the city, tried new foods, and talked for hours on end. They were like two halves of a whole, complete only when they were together.

But then, one day, J didn't show up for their date. He didn't answer her calls or texts, and Maya was left feeling alone and confused.

Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. Maya tried to move on, to find another soulmate who could fill the void, but no one could come close to the joy she had experienced with J.

It wasn't until nearly a year had passed that she finally got the news she'd been dreading – J had been in a car accident and was in a coma. Maya rushed to the hospital, her heart in her throat.

As she stood by J's bedside, holding his hand, she felt a sense of peace wash over her. Even though he couldn't speak, she knew that he was still with her in some way. And then, as if by some miracle, he opened his eyes and looked at her.

"I'm sorry," he whispered, his voice barely audible. "I love you."

Maya felt tears stream down her face as she heard J's words, his last and greatest gift to her. And even though she was alone once again, she knew that the love they had shared would last forever.
