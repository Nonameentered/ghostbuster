Childhood memory poem
As I sat down to write a childhood memory poem, one particular moment came to mind. I remembered the time my little sister and I spent a hot summer afternoon playing outside with our friends. The sun was shining bright overhead, and we were all filled with boundless energy.

We played all sorts of games, from tag to hopscotch, but the highlight of the day was our impromptu water balloon fight. We laughed and squealed as we ran around, lobbing balloons filled with cool water at each other.

As the afternoon wore on, our water supply began to dwindle. We pooled our remaining balloons into one big one and took turns trying to pop it. When it finally burst, we were all soaked through, but we didn't care. We collapsed onto the grass, exhausted but happy.

That moment of carefree joy and pure childhood innocence is something I'll always cherish. It was one of those magical moments that you can't plan, but you'll never forget.
