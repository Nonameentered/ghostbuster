The day I left to war, she told me not to come back home.
The day had arrived. My bags were packed, and I was ready to leave for war. My wife, however, was against the idea. She pleaded with me not to go, saying that it was too dangerous, and that we needed to think about our future together.

I tried to reason with her, telling her that this was my duty. As a soldier, I had a responsibility to protect my country. But she was adamant, and in the end, she delivered an ultimatum.

"If you go," she said, "don't bother coming back home."

I was stunned. I couldn't believe that she would say such a thing, but it was clear that she was serious. She told me that she couldn't bear the thought of losing me, and that if I went to war, she would never forgive me.

Torn between my duties as a soldier and my love for my wife, I struggled to make a decision. In the end, after much contemplation, I decided that I had to go. It was my duty, and I couldn't shirk from it.

As I left, I cast a final glance back at my wife. She was standing at the door, tears streaming down her face. I knew that this was going to be the hardest thing that I had ever done.

Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. The war raged on, and every day I thought of my wife and wondered if I had made the right decision. It was a constant battle between my sense of duty and my love for her.

Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, I returned home. As I walked up to the door, I saw my wife waiting for me on the other side. She rushed to me, throwing her arms around me and holding me tight.

In that moment, I knew that everything was going to be alright. Despite the pain and the suffering, our love had endured, and we would weather any storm together.
