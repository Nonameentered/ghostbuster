Write a romantic story, but replace kissing with something strange or mundane that, in this world, is just as arousing.
Sarah and Tom had been dating for just over a year, and they were deeply in love. But they had a weird habit that made their friends raise their eyebrows. Instead of kissing, they plucked each other's eyebrows.

It started as a joke when Sarah mentioned how much she loved Tom's thick eyebrows, and one day she playfully picked one. They both laughed, but then Tom returned the favor, and they both felt a strange sensation.

They soon realized that they were just as aroused by plucking each other's eyebrows as they were by kissing. It became their special thing, and they'd spend hours just gently plucking each other's eyebrows and whispering sweet nothings in each other's ears.

Their friends thought it was weird, but Sarah and Tom didn't care. They were happy, and that's all that mattered. In their eyes, plucking eyebrows was just as romantic as any kiss.
