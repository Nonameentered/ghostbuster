Three people meet at the entrance to heaven. One is meant to enter, one is supposed to go to hell, and the third is not listed.
At the entrance to heaven, three people encountered each other. The first was Jack, a kind-hearted man who had dedicated his life to helping others. He was curious and excited about what was waiting beyond the pearly gates. The second person was a woman named Sarah, who had been selfish and cruel in life. She was terrified of what lay ahead, knowing she was destined for hell. And then there was the third person, a man whose name wasn't on the list.

As they approached the gates, Saint Peter greeted them and looked through the book to see their fates. As he read the names, he came upon the third man and looked confused. He asked the man his name, but the man couldn't remember. Saint Peter scoured the book, but the man's name wasn't anywhere to be found.

It was then that a voice boomed from above. "He has yet to fulfill his purpose on Earth." The trio looked up, stunned.

The revelation left Jack and Sarah baffled, but the unknown man knew what he had to do. He bid them farewell and descended back to Earth, determined to fulfill his purpose so that he may one day rejoin them at the gates of heaven.
