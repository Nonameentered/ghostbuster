As a prison guard, Peter Johnson had seen it all. He had seen the toughest and the roughest of criminals behind bars. He had seen tears of guilt and regret, and he had also seen the fierce determination in the eyes of hardened criminals to break loose. He had also seen his fair share of humorous moments, but none of them had tickled his funny bone quite like what he had in mind right now.

For days, Peter had been preparing for this moment. He had devised a pun that was so clever, so hilarious, that he just had to share it with the world. He had even put a bet on it with his colleagues; he was convinced he could pull off the joke without getting into any trouble with the higher-ups.

On Saturday evening, Peter found his opportunity. He was manning one of the control rooms on the lower levels of the prison when he spotted his target - a tiny figure pacing back and forth in one of the cells. The figure was none other than Joey "The Mouse" Marconi, a notorious burglar who had evaded arrest for years thanks to his small size and nimble maneuvers.

Peter knew that making this joke to Joey "The Mouse" Marconi was a risk, but he took it anyway. He cleared his throat and spoke into the intercom, "Hey, Mouse, you know what they say about a criminal who escapes from prison? They say he's a small medium at large!"

Peter held his breath, hoping for a reaction from the other side of the line. But his anticipation was met with complete silence. Joey "The Mouse" Marconi just stared at Peter blankly, as if he had not understood the joke. Peter tried again, a bit louder this time, “Come on, Mouse, small medium at large! Don’t you get it?”

Joey continued to stare back, unresponsive.

Peter's hopes sank. In the silence that followed, Peter began to contemplate the possible consequences of his ill-timed joke. Would he be reprimanded? Would they make him apologize? Would they take away his badge?

But then, finally, a chuckle emerged from the other side of the line. A small, soft chuckle that gradually grew louder.

Joey's laugh echoed through the intercom, and in that moment, Peter knew he had succeeded. He had managed to crack one of the most elusive and dangerous criminals with a mere pun.

After that, things changed between Peter and Joey. They started having small conversations, and Peter found out that Joey had a good sense of humor. Peter would continue to make jokes from time to time on the intercom, and Joey would always laugh even if the pun wasn't that great.

Over the next few weeks, Peter would find himself looking forward to his shifts just so that he could spend a few moments joking with Joey. In a sense, Joey had become his friend despite the bars that separated them.

One day Peter was transferred to another prison and he never saw Joey again, but he would always remember that pun. He learned that humor could break the barriers of fear and mistrust. And he learned that a small medium at large could bring even the toughest of criminals and prison guards closer together.
