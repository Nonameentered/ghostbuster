I was standing in the middle of the busy city sidewalk, admiring the view of the towering skyscrapers around me, when a man approached me from the crowd. He was tall and slim, with an intense gaze that made me feel uneasy. He handed me a credit card, and as I reached out to take it, I saw him pull out a pistol from underneath his jacket. In one swift motion, he lifted the gun to his temple and pulled the trigger.

I was in shock. I stumbled backwards, colliding into a group of people behind me who had been drawn to the commotion. I didn't even realize that I still held the credit card in my hand, until I looked down and saw that the name on the card had changed from his to mine. The whole scene felt like a surreal dream - a bad one, at that.

My nerves were shot as I made my way back to my apartment, the sound of the gunshot ringing in my ears. Once inside my quiet apartment, I glanced at the credit card again. It looked ordinary and brand new, with my name embossed on the front. This can't be real, I thought to myself. Was it some sort of sick joke? 

Several days went by, and I tried to go about my life as normal, but the strange incident kept haunting me. I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. One afternoon, I made the decision to go to my bank and get the credit card checked out. When I arrived, I explained the situation to the employee behind the desk.

â€œLet's take a look at the card," he said, taking it from me and scanning it through the machine. I was relieved that he didn't look at me like I was crazy, and he seemed genuinely interested to help. The machine beeped, and he frowned. "It's strange," he murmured. "The card number matches with your name, but there are no records of it being issued."

I felt a chill run down my spine. This couldn't be happening. But it was. The bank employee suggested that we contact the police, and before I knew it, I was giving my statement to a detective who had arrived at the bank. The detective agreed that the situation was unusual and he promised to investigate further.

Days turned into weeks and weeks into months, but nothing ever came of the investigation. There were no leads, no clues, nothing. The card sat in my wallet, a constant reminder that something was off in my life. The more I thought about it, the more paranoid I became. Was someone watching me? Was my life in danger?

Then, one day, I got a call from the detective. "We've found something," he said urgently. "You need to come down to the station." I drove to the police station in a hurry, my heart pounding in my chest. Has someone been arrested? Have they found evidence?

But when I arrived, there was no sign of the detective. A receptionist at the front desk handed me an envelope, with a note saying, "Open in private." I raced back to my car and tore it open, my hands shaking.

Inside was another credit card, with my name printed on it. But this one was different. Instead of the typical credit card design, it had a black backdrop with bold white letters spelling out the words "The Deal". 

As I sat there, staring at the card, I felt a chill wash over me. Was this some sort of game? A cruel joke? I didn't want to play along, but I didn't know what else to do. I decided to take the card home and keep it hidden away. But even as I tried to live a normal life, I couldn't help but feel like I was being watched.

Days went by, and eventually, I couldn't take the burden anymore. Feeling like I was on the edge of insanity, I decided to confront the situation head-on. I drove to the place where the first card was given to me, hoping to find some answers. But the area was abandoned, with no sign of the man or his belongings.

As I was about to turn around and leave, I heard a faint buzzing noise coming from my pocket. I reached for my phone, but when I pulled it out, I saw that it wasn't my phone beeping. It was the credit card - The Deal - vibrating rhythmically. Without hesitation, I followed the direction of the buzz and found myself standing in front of a small alleyway. 

Heart pounding, I carefully navigated my way through the narrow passage, until I reached the end. And there, standing before me, was the man who had given me the credit cards. 

Before I could utter a word, he spoke. "It seems like you've figured out the game, kid." His voice was raspy and low, sending shivers down my spine. "So, what's the deal?" I asked shakily.

"The deal is what you make it," he replied slyly.

And with that, he was gone, vanishing just as quickly as he had appeared. 

As I stood there, trying to process what had just happened, I realized the true value of The Deal. It was a game, a test of my wits, a blessing and a curse. It was opportunity and danger.

The only question was, what would I do with it?
