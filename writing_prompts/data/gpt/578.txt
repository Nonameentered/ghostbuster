The first time she called me "mama," I was over the moon. I had been waiting for this moment ever since I held her in my arms for the first time. She was my sweet little angel and I was her proud mother. But as time passed, things changed. She grew more and more violent, and I couldn't control her outbursts. The last time she called me "mama," I knew it was the end. They took her away and branded her a monster. They executed her in front of the whole world, and all I could do was watch in horror. As they injected the lethal injection, I remembered the first time she called me "mama" and wished I could turn back time. But it was too late. She was gone, and I was left with the memories of a loving daughter who couldn't control her inner demons.
