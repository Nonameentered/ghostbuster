Everyone has a 2nd soul, that can use magic and take over the 1st soul when times get tough. Most people have wolves, tigers, and other animals as their 2nd soul. You have a demon as yours.
Ever since I was young, I knew that I was different from everyone else. While most people had wolves, tigers, and other animals as their second soul, I had a demon. People looked at me with fear and suspicion, which only made me feel lonelier.

My parents, however, always told me that having a demon as my second soul meant that I was strong and capable of handling any challenge that came my way. But there were moments when I wished for a normal second soul, something that wouldn't scare people away.

It wasn't until I was thirteen that I truly understood the power of my second soul. My father was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and my family was devastated. For months, we watched as he gradually weakened, his body wasting away before our eyes.

At first, I didn't realize what was happening, but one day, as I sat by my father's bedside, something inside me stirred. My hands began to glow with a fiery red light, and my father's breathing grew more even. The pain on his face melted away, and he looked at me with confusion and awe.

It took me a while to understand what had happened, but eventually, I realized that my demon had taken over my body and used its magic to ease my father's suffering.

From that moment on, I embraced my second soul. Over time, I learned how to control it and use its power to protect myself and those around me. I became known as the girl with the demon second soul, and instead of being afraid, people came to me for help when they needed it most.

But there were still those who saw me as a monster. They whispered behind my back, and some even went as far as to accuse me of using dark magic. It hurt, but I knew that I couldn't let their fear stop me from being who I was.

One night, as I was walking home from school, a group of boys cornered me in an alley. They taunted me, calling me a freak and demanding that I show them my demon. I tried to ignore them and walk away, but they grabbed my arms and wouldn't let me go.

In that moment, my demon took over. My eyes turned red, and a dark smoke began to rise from my body. The boys tried to run, but it was too late. My demon unleashed its power and sent them flying, leaving them cowering on the ground.

As I walked away, I realized that I had the power to stand up for myself and protect those around me. I wasn't a monster. I was just different.

Years passed, and I became a respected member of my community, known for my ability to heal and protect those in need. I even started teaching young children how to control their own second souls, so that they wouldn't have to be afraid of their own power.

But despite everything that I had accomplished, there were still moments when I wished that I could be like everyone else. I wished for a second soul that wouldn't scare people away, that wouldn't make me an outcast.

It wasn't until I was much older that I realized that my demon was a part of me, and that without it, I wouldn't be who I was. It was my strength and my power, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

As I looked back on my life, I realized that having a demon as my second soul had been a gift, one that allowed me to overcome the challenges that life had thrown my way and become the person that I was meant to be.
