The Interrogator was a man who had seen it all in his line of work. He had been a hitman for years, plowing his way through the ranks of the criminal underworld with his incredible skills as an interrogator. He was always called upon when the bosses wanted a job done quickly, efficiently, and most importantly, with as little bloodshed as possible.

But there was one thing that set The Interrogator apart from all the other hitmen. He knew exactly how much time he had left to live. His lifespan was determined by the number of words he had left to speak. He had been born with millions of words, but once he ran out, he would die instantly.

It was a strange way to live, but he had grown accustomed to it over the years. He had always been a man of few words, but he had learned to value them even more since he learned of his strange condition. He made sure to use them wisely and sparingly, only using them when they were absolutely necessary.

The Interrogator was called upon for a job that he had been anticipating for weeks. He had been tasked with extracting information from a low-level criminal who had gotten in over his head with the wrong people. The criminal was holed up in a dingy apartment on the outskirts of the city.

The Interrogator arrived at the apartment building early in the morning. The sun was just beginning to rise, casting a soft orange glow over the city. He made his way up to the apartment on the second floor, taking care not to alert the neighbors.

He knocked softly on the door, and a voice inside called out, asking who it was. The Interrogator gave his name, and the door creaked open.

The criminal was a small, wiry man, with beady eyes and a thick Russian accent. He looked up at The Interrogator with a mixture of fear and defiance.

"I have nothing to say to you," he spat out.

The Interrogator merely smiled, a cold, predatory look in his eyes. He made his way into the apartment, closing the door firmly behind him.

"Don't make this harder than it needs to be," The Interrogator said calmly. "You know why I'm here. The bosses want answers, and they want them now."

The criminal remained silent, his arms folded tightly across his chest.

The Interrogator took a step closer to the criminal, his gaze never wavering. "I'll make this simple for you. You have one word left."

The criminal's eyes widened in shock. "One word?" he gasped out.

The Interrogator nodded. "One word. You can either tell me what I need to know, or you can die with that word still on your lips."

The criminal hesitated for a moment, then spoke hurriedly. "I-I can't tell you anything. They'll kill me if I do."

The Interrogator merely raised an eyebrow, unimpressed. "Who will kill you?"

The criminal shook his head violently, his eyes darting around the room. "I can't say, I can't say!"

The Interrogator sighed, his patience wearing thin. He had always found it easier to extract information through other means, but his word count was running low. He had to get this done quickly.

He took a step forward, looming over the criminal. "You're running out of time," he growled.

The criminal shrank back, fear etched on his face. He knew that The Interrogator was not a man to be trifled with.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the criminal spoke.

"Okay, okay!" he shouted. "I'll tell you everything you want to know. Just don't kill me!"

The Interrogator smiled triumphantly. He knew that he had won.

He spent the next hour grilling the criminal, extracting every last piece of information that he could. When he was satisfied that he had gotten everything he needed, he began to make his way out of the apartment.

As he walked down the hallway towards the stairs, he couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. He had done his job well, and he had done it with the fewest words possible.

But as he made his way down the stairs and out into the street, he couldn't help but wonder how many words he had left. He had never been one to keep count, preferring to live in the moment and enjoy the time that he had left.

But now, as he walked away from the apartment building, he realized that he was running dangerously low on words. He couldn't afford to waste a single one.

He made a mental note to be more careful in the future, to think before he spoke, and to use his words sparingly.

For in his line of work, words truly were a matter of life and death.
