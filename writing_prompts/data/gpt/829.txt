I am a member of the Trelaxian empire, a small, peaceful race from a faraway planet. Our species has always lived in harmony with our surroundings, never taking more than we need and always respecting the balance of nature. That is why I was chosen to be the first Trelaxian to explore the vast expanse of the galaxy beyond our own.

As a diplomat, it was my responsibility to establish connections with any intelligent life we might encounter, to learn from them and share our own knowledge in return. But something went wrong. My ship was hit by a meteorite, and I lost control. I plummeted through space for what felt like an eternity before crash-landing on a small, blue planet called Earth.

Almost immediately, I knew I was in danger. The air was thick with pollution, and the natural landscape had been obliterated by vast urban sprawls and industrial complexes. The creatures that roamed this world were not like any I had ever seen before; they were violent, competitive, and selfish. They fought each other for resources, waged war over their conflicting beliefs and ideologies, and showed little regard for the well-being of their planet or its inhabitants.

For a while, I tried to maintain a low profile, observing the humans from the cover of the forest. I watched as they tortured and killed the animals of this world, chopped down trees, polluted the oceans, and turned a once-beautiful planet into a barren wasteland. But I knew in my heart that I could not stay silent.

I managed to activate the communication system on my ship and send a final transmission back to my home planet. It was a message of warning, begging my fellow Trelaxians to stay away from Earth, to avoid any contact with its inhabitants, and to quarantine the planet before it was too late.

With each passing moment, I felt myself growing weaker. The impact of the crash had left me badly injured, and the toxic atmosphere was taking its toll on my body. But I knew I had to hold on just a little longer, until my message was received and understood by those who could act on it.

As the days passed, I watched from my hiding place as the humans continued on their destructive path. They built towering skyscrapers and factories that belched smoke and pollution into the sky, they dammed rivers and diverted water sources at their whim, and they hunted the remaining creatures of this world without mercy.

I tried to reason with them, to make them see the error of their ways, but it soon became clear that they had no interest in listening. They saw me as a threat, a potential enemy that needed to be eliminated.

One night, a group of humans stumbled upon my hiding place. I tried to explain who I was, where I had come from, and why I was here. But they saw only my alien appearance, and they attacked me without hesitation.

I fought back with every ounce of strength I had left, but it was no use. They overwhelmed me, and I knew that my end was near.

With my last breath, I managed to activate the self-destruct mechanism on my ship, ensuring that none of its advanced technology would fall into human hands. I left this world the same way I had entered it: alone, in pain, and with a sense of profound sadness at the state of the civilization I had encountered.

As I drifted off into the void, I hoped that my final message had been heard, that my sacrifice had not been in vain. I hoped that my fellow Trelaxians would heed my warning, and that they would take action to prevent the humans from spreading their destructive influence any further. I hoped that one day, this planet might be restored to its former glory, and that the creatures that called it home might learn to live in harmony once again.

But even as I died, a small thought lingered in my mind, a thought that terrified me to the core. What if the humans were not an anomaly, but rather a reflection of what existed elsewhere in the universe? What if every planet held its own version of these violent, selfish beings, intent on taking and destroying that which they saw as theirs to claim? What if my own kind was the exception, not the rule?

It was a bleak thought, and one that I hoped would never prove true. But as I slipped away into the great unknown, I knew that I had left behind a warning that could not be ignored, a warning that rang out across the cosmos: Beware humans.
