Each year the USA government closes out a year from the past. When they do, all crimes committed that year are wiped clean. Criminals may now confess their crimes without punishment. You've been making the headlines for decades.
For the past few months, the news channels had been buzzing about the upcoming closeout of the year 2000. It was the year when I, the notorious serial killer, had wreaked havoc on the streets of New York City. I had killed at least a dozen women, and the authorities had been on my tail for months until they finally caught me. The trial was a spectacle, and I was sentenced to life imprisonment.

The closeout of the year 2000 meant that all the crimes committed that year would be wiped clean, and the criminals could now confess their crimes without punishment. For me, it was an opportunity to come clean and lift the burden off my chest. I had to make amends for what I had done, and the only way to do it was to confess.

I sat in my cell, thinking about the years that had flown by since my imprisonment. I had aged considerably, and the people who had once feared me had forgotten me. But I remembered everything – the way I had killed those women, and the thrill it gave me.

As I lay on my cot, I made a decision. I was going to come clean. I knew it wouldn't bring back the people I had killed, but it was my way of taking responsibility and showing the world that I wasn't a monster anymore.

The next day, I requested to speak to the warden. I was nervous as I waited for him to arrive at my cell, unsure of what his reaction would be. When he finally showed up, he looked at me suspiciously.

"What do you want, Gibson?" he asked.

"I want to confess," I said quietly.

The warden raised his eyebrows in surprise. "Confess to what?"

"To the murders I committed in 2000," I said. "I want to take responsibility for what I've done."

The warden looked at me for a moment, then nodded. "I'll inform the authorities," he said. "They'll want to talk to you."

Over the next few days, I was interviewed extensively by the police. I told them everything, holding nothing back. I described the way I had stalked my victims and the thrill I felt when I killed them. The detectives listened carefully, taking notes and asking me questions when necessary.

After a week, the news broke. The infamous serial killer, Gibson, had confessed to his crimes. The media went into a frenzy, covering every detail of my confession and analyzing my psychology. My mugshot was plastered all over the newspapers and TV channels, and people gawked at me as I was taken to court.

The trial was different this time around. Instead of fighting for my innocence, I pleaded guilty. The prosecutor was satisfied, and the judge sentenced me to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. But I wasn't afraid. I had come clean, and that was all that mattered.

As the days went by, I was flooded with letters from people all over the country. Some called me a monster, while others called me a hero for confessing. I didn't know what to make of it all. I was just happy that I could finally be honest with myself and with the world.

But then, something strange happened. The government announced that they were not going to close out the year 2000 after all. They said that it had been a mistake and that the closeout wouldn't happen until the next year.

I was stunned. What did that mean for my confession? Would I still be punished for my deeds, even though I had confessed during the time when I thought I wouldn't be punished?

The authorities didn't give a clear answer. They simply put me back in my cell and left me to contemplate my fate.

Days turned into weeks, and I grew restless. I didn't know what was going to happen to me. Would the government change its mind and let me go free? Or would I be punished for my crimes, even though I had confessed?

Finally, after what felt like a lifetime, I received a notice from the government. They had made a decision – all the confessions made during the period when the closeout was supposed to happen would be accepted, regardless of whether the closeout actually happened or not.

I breathed a sigh of relief. My confession had been accepted, and I wouldn't be punished for it. But I wasn't happy. I had confessed because I wanted to take responsibility for what I had done. But now, it felt like I had gotten away with it.

The years went by, and I remained in prison. The world had moved on, and the people who had once been afraid of me had forgotten me. I had become just another inmate, another statistic on the government's crime records.

But I couldn't forget. Every day, I thought about those women I had killed. I thought about the families I had destroyed and the lives I had taken away.

And then, one day, I was given an opportunity to make amends. The prison was holding a workshop on rehabilitation, and the authorities asked me if I wanted to participate. I agreed.

Over the next few months, I worked hard to change myself. I talked to therapists, worked on my anger management, and took courses on different subjects. I also started writing letters to the families of the women I had killed, asking for forgiveness and expressing my remorse.

It was a slow process, but gradually, I started to feel like a different person. I was no longer the monster who had killed those women. I was someone who had made a mistake and was willing to take responsibility for it.

The day finally came when I was released from prison. I stepped out into the world, blinking in the bright sunlight. The air felt fresh, and everything looked different. For the first time in years, I felt like I had a second chance.

I knew that I could never change what I had done in the past. The women I had killed would never come back, and the families I had destroyed would never fully recover. But I also knew that I could make a difference in the present.

I started working with organizations that helped victims of crime. I shared my story with people who were going through similar situations and tried to offer them hope. I even lobbied for changes in the justice system, advocating for more rehabilitation and less punishment.

It wasn't easy, but I knew that it was what I had to do. I had spent years hiding behind my crimes, but now, I wanted to be known for something else. I wanted to be known for my redemption.
