Humans are born with a mark around their wrist which has a matching color with that of their soulmate's, but can change through their life. Your mark has had a blue hue since you were 14, but one night, while you're out, people start looking at you funny. You realize that your mark is gone.
Ever since I was 14 and my mark appeared on my wrist - a subtle blue hue that matched the color of my soulmate's - I've been counting down the days until I'd finally meet them. I'd daydreamed about it endlessly, even imagining the kind of life that we'd have together. We'd be two halves of a whole, two puzzle pieces that fit perfectly together.

But as I grew older, and the years passed without me finding my soulmate, I started to lose hope. I became convinced that I was destined to be alone for the rest of my life. Every time I saw someone else with a matching mark, I felt a pang of jealousy in my heart.

One night, I was out at a bar with some friends, feeling more alone than ever. As we sat around a table, chatting and laughing, I suddenly noticed that people were looking at me strangely. It took me a moment to realize why.

My mark was gone.

In its place was a pale, blank expanse of skin. I lifted my wrist up to my face, almost disbelieving what I was seeing. The touch of my fingers on my skin was a jolt of cold electricity that made me shiver.

"What's wrong?" one of my friends asked, noticing my expression.

I held up my wrist, showing them. "My mark," I said, my voice faint. "It's gone."

They all leaned forward, peering at my wrist with expressions of concern.

"Maybe it's just a mistake," one of them said. "Maybe it'll come back."

But deep down, I knew that wasn't the case. I'd heard stories of marks fading away before, of people losing their soulmates after years of searching. It was a rare occurrence, but it happened. And now it had happened to me.

For the next few weeks, I was in a daze. I went through the motions of my everyday life, but everything felt disconnected, as if I was watching everything from behind a sheet of glass. Everywhere I went, my eyes searched for a glimpse of blue, a sign that my soulmate was nearby. But the mark stayed stubbornly blank.

Slowly but surely, I began to accept that I was alone. That I'd lost my soulmate forever, and that my life would never be the same.

As the weeks turned into months, the emptiness inside me only grew. I'd always been a solitary person, content with my own company, but now my loneliness was like a weight on my chest, pressing down on me until I could hardly breathe.

One day, as I was walking home from work, I passed a woman on the street. She was small, with delicately curved features and a pixie cut that highlighted the blue of her eyes. She smiled at me as we passed, and my heart skipped a beat.

I didn't believe in love at first sight. I'd seen enough of the world to know that it was never that simple. But there was something about her, something that tugged at my soul like a magnet. I turned around, watching her as she disappeared down the street.

It couldn't be her. It was impossible.

But as I walked home, I felt a warmth spreading through me - a warmth I hadn't felt in months. It was like the first rays of sunlight after a long winter.

Over the next few days, I found myself returning to that same spot on the street, watching for her. And eventually, she appeared again. This time, I stopped her.

"Excuse me," I said, feeling awkward. "I know this is going to sound crazy, but…can I buy you a cup of coffee?"

She looked me over, her gaze darting to my wrist and back up. For a moment, I was sure that she was going to say no, and I'd be left with nothing but my own foolishness.

But then she smiled, and her eyes sparkled like stars. "Sure," she said. "I'd like that."

We went to a nearby café, each of us sipping a coffee as we talked. I learned that her name was Lily, that she was a photographer with a fondness for old books and indie music. She had a laugh that made my heart swell in my chest.

It was only after we'd been there for an hour that she noticed my mark. Her eyes flickered down to my wrist, and I felt myself holding my breath.

"Blue," she said softly. "That's a nice color."

My heart leaped. "Yours too?"

She shook her head. "No, mine's green."

I felt a moment of confusion, of disbelief. But then I realized what had happened. My mark hadn't faded away. It had changed color, to match the woman sitting across from me.

Lily.

My soulmate.

I looked down at my wrist, feeling a smile spreading across my face. The mark wasn't gone after all. It had just been waiting for the right moment.

And now, as Lily took my hand across the table, I felt like I was whole for the first time in my life. Like I'd finally found my place in the world.

Maybe the journey had been longer than I'd expected. But it turned out that the destination was worth it.
