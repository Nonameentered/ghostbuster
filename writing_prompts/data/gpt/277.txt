John and Lily had been friends since kindergarten. They did everything together- playing, studying, eating. John had always loved Lily, but he never said anything, afraid of ruining their friendship.

In high school, Lily started dating someone else, and John was heartbroken. But he couldn't bring himself to hate her boyfriend because he knew how happy Lily was with him.

Years passed, and John stayed by Lily's side through all her ups and downs, even when her boyfriend broke her heart. John was always there, holding her when she cried, helping her pick up the pieces.

Eventually, Lily found someone new and fell in love. John was happy for her. But deep down, he knew he would never be with her.

Years went by, and John watched from the sidelines as Lily got married, had children, and built a life without him. He was happy for her, but his heart was heavy with the knowledge that he could never tell her how he truly felt.

And so, John lived out his days, never getting the girl he loved but always being her friend until the end.
