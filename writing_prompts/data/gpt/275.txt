As soon as Clara heard about the newest fad of clone clubs, she knew she had to try it out. She always wanted to know what it would be like to spend 12 hours with the legendary singer, Beyonc√©. She submitted a sample of her DNA, and in just a few hours, her clone was ready.

As soon as the door to the VIP room opened, Clara was ecstatic. Her clone was an exact replica of Queen Bey, from the sleek hair to the high-heeled boots. They spent the next 12 hours dancing, singing and having an amazing time.

As the night went on, Clara found herself bonding with her clone. She felt like she was spending time with a long-time friend. When the time was up, Clara felt a pang of sadness knowing that the clone she was so attached to would be disposed of.

The next morning, Clara tried to forget about her experience, but she couldn't shake the feeling of guilt. How could she have enjoyed something so much knowing that it was unethical. She realized that technology had evolved too fast, and society wasn't ready for it.

Clara decided to donate to research for ethical cloning and to spread awareness about the dangers of clone clubs. She learned that sometimes, just because something is available doesn't necessarily mean it's right.
