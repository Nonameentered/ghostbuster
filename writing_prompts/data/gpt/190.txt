Humans have a trait, that when in danger, they revert/grow into their peak physical form and intelligence, which can last as long as their life is in danger. Everyone on Earth has gone Prime, and it's been over three years since it began.
The world had changed in a way that nobody could have ever predicted. People were no longer ordinary humans, they had something extraordinary within them. It was a gift - a curse, bestowed upon them by an unknown force. When faced with danger, humans now had the ability to transform into their peak physical and intellectual form, giving them the strength, speed, and skills to tackle any threat.

It happened three years ago. Nobody knows how or why it happened, but it happened to everyone. People were initially scared and confused, but they soon realized that their newly acquired abilities were incredible. They found out that they could do things that were previously thought impossible. They could run faster, jump higher, and think quicker.

The first few weeks were chaotic. People were unsure of how long this new state of being would last, or if there were any limitations to what they could do. But eventually, things settled down. People learned to control their transformations, and society adapted accordingly.

Superheroes and vigilantes soon emerged, using their newfound powers to help others and fight crime. The military also changed, with soldiers becoming even more deadly than before. Suddenly, they were capable of doing things that were once unimaginable.

Many people found that they no longer needed to rely on technology or medicine to stay healthy. They could regenerate and heal themselves faster than ever before. The world was transformed forever.

But not everyone was happy about the changes. There were people who became power-hungry, using their newfound abilities to dominate and control others. This led to wars and conflicts all over the world.

Despite all the changes, life continued. People adapted and continued to live their lives as best they could. There were still good people in the world who used their powers for the betterment of all. The world had changed, but it was still a place worth living in.

Nobody knew what had caused the transformation, or how long it would last. But they did know one thing for sure - nothing would ever be the same again.
