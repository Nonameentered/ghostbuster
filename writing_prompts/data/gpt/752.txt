A terminally ill man and a suicidal person accidentally meet and strike up a conversation. What do they say?
It was a bright, sunny day in the park, but Will didn't notice that. He was too busy trying to catch his breath and trying to navigate his wheelchair through the crowded walkways. He was a terminally ill man, and he knew he didn't have much time left. Cancer had consumed his body, and he was barely hanging on.

As he was about to give up on his aimless lingering in the park, he accidentally ran into someone. To Will's surprise, he was a young man with deep circles under his eyes, wearing dark clothes, and generally looking like he'd been dragged through the mud. Will was immediately concerned he'd hurt him.

"Are you okay?" Will asked, trying to steady himself.

The man shrugged. "I've been better. It doesn't really matter, though."

Will looked at him with concern, and a slight hint of annoyance. "It doesn't matter? That's no way to talk about your life. What's going on?"

"What's going on?" The man scoffed, "what's the point in telling you anything?"

"Try me," Will said, feeling a twinge of energy start to rise in him despite his exhaustion.

The man sneered and walked away. Will felt a pang of disappointment at first before something shifted just as he was about to roll away.

"Hey!" Will called out desperately, "I'm dying. Maybe it's not the same thing, but I know what it's like. The world's a hell of a lot better than just giving up."

The suicidal man stopped, and walked back slowly. They fell into a deep silence, the kind that sits thick and heavy between two people who have been through their own separate hells.

"I'm Will," he said after a long period of silence.

"Joe," the man responded but refused to go further.

"Joe, life is precious. It may not seem like it, but you have to keep living."

The man rolled his eyes.

"I'm going to die soon, and that's something that I can't change. But you have your whole life ahead of you. Don't let whatever's going on drag you under," Will urged.

"Why would anyone want to go through the suffering of living?" Joe asked bitterly.

"You don't know what you'll find around the corner," Will said caringly, "It's the mystery of life that makes it worth living."

Joe laughed at that. "You're dying, what would you know about that mystery?"

"I know enough," Will shot back. "I'll tell you this, I've seen the most amazing things. I've met great people and experienced things I could have never dreamed of. There's still beauty in this world, but you have to find it yourself."

Joe looked down at his feet.

"I don't know how to find it. I don't want to keep going living like this. It's always one thing after another, you know?" Joe said, his voice cracking. "I feel like I'm justâ€¦ done."

Will felt a pit in his stomach, but he didn't let that show. Instead, he said simply, "Life can be hard, but it's worth it. You don't want to miss that moment where everything changes, where you realize that everything was leading up to a beautiful final act. You're so close, and it would be a shame to give up now."

Joe was silent for a while. Will could hear people talking and kids playing in the background. He looked around, trying to find some inspiration.

"I don't think I have the strength, Will," he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

"You do," Will said assuredly. "You just need a reason to hold on."

Joe looked up at him, then away. He looked back again, and a small glimmer of something like pure stubbornness was in his eyes. "What's your reason?"

"That's easy," Will said, "I'm a father. I want to see my daughter grow up."

Joe looked at him, speechless.

"That's a damn good reason," he said finally. "I don't have that."

"Find it," Will said, "whether it's family, friends, travel, or the smallest reason, find it and hold onto it tight. Life is precious, Joe. You deserve to experience it. So don't miss out on it."

There was a palpable moment of understanding that Joe could never quite put a finger on. It was like a light came on inside him, and he realized that maybe there was a reason for him too. Maybe there was a world beyond the crap that he was currently going through.

"I'll try," he said slowly, almost disbelieving that he was actually going to attempt to live after years of feeling like his life was worthless.

Will sighed with relief and ran a hand through his hair, "Thank you. That's all I ask."

They sat there in the park for a while longer, just talking. Slowly, a lightness that neither had experienced in a while started to fill them. They talked about the sun and the birds, and Will described the way it felt to hold his daughter's hand. Joe spoke of the things he wished he had the strength to do in the future. Together, they made bigger plans for tomorrow, a new tomorrow neither had imagined before.
