In the year 2053, humanity achieved the ultimate triumph over death. Medical science had advanced to the point where we could all live forever. It was a utopian dream come true, and people all over the world celebrated as if it were the second coming of Christ. But what they failed to realize was that this great achievement came at a terrible price.

In the years that followed, the population exploded. Billionaires and oligarchs held sway over the government. They controlled the food, water, and other resources that were needed to sustain us. They ruthlessly exploited the environment and drained the planet of its natural reserves. The world had turned into a giant rat race, and we were all scurrying around in it like so many rodents.

As the old saying goes, where there are rats, there's bound to be war. The rich fought over their precious resources, each one trying to outdo the other. They built weapons of incredible power and devastation. Misguided ideologies and religious extremism fueled the conflict, pitting people against each other in a never-ending cycle of violence.

The worst part was that nobody died. The weapons they used were non-lethal but incredibly destructive. They could level entire cities and leave their inhabitants severely maimed and wounded. It was a fate worse than death, condemned to live in a world of pain and suffering.

The first time I saw war up close was when I was deployed to the front lines. I was young and naive then, eager to serve my country in whatever way I could. But the horrors of war quickly disabused me of any romantic notions I had about service and duty.

I saw soldiers on both sides of the conflict, lying on the ground, their limbs blown away, their bodies ripped apart by shrapnel. The screams of the wounded filled my ears, drowning out everything else. The smell of blood and gunpowder suffused the air, making me nauseous.

I remember one time when I was assigned to a unit tasked with clearing a town that had been taken over by rebels. We were supposed to go in and neutralize any threats. But the rebels were ready for us. They had planted a massive bomb in the town square and rigged it to detonate as soon as we entered.

The explosion was immense. It lifted me off my feet and sent me flying through the air. When I landed, I saw that my entire unit had been wiped out. There was nothing left of them, just blood and body parts scattered all over the place.

I was the only one who survived. I was wounded, badly burned and scarred for life. But the worst part was the trauma. It never left me. I woke up every night since then, screaming for help, begging to be released from the nightmares that haunted me.

After that, I became a conscientious objector. I refused to take part in any more wars. I retreated to the mountains, away from the madding crowd, living as a hermit. It was a quiet life, and I found peace in the solitude.

But then, one day, I heard that the war had come to me. The rebels had infiltrated the mountains, and they were coming to finish the job they had started all those years ago. I tried to bar the door to my cabin, but it was no use. They broke through easily, and soon I found myself staring down the barrel of a gun.

There was a moment of silence as the rebel looked directly at me. “I know who you are,” he said. “You’re the one who survived the bombing. You’re the hero of the enemy.”

I saw the recognition in his eyes, and then he lowered his gun. “I’m sorry,” he said. “I thought you were someone else. You’re just a harmless old man.”

He turned and walked out, leaving me alone in the cabin. I sat there for a long time, savoring the silence. It was only then that I realized something. Death may have been eradicated, but war was still alive and well. It was something that could never be overcome, no matter how advanced our technology became. I had survived the worst of it, and yet I was still alive. And I wondered what the point of it all was.
