'The darkness is similar to a spider; we may fear it, but it fears us more.'
Once upon a time, in a small village, a young boy was afraid of darkness. He would hide under his blanket, cower in his room, and refuse to go outside, even during the day. People in the village found the young boy odd and often teased him. The boy felt isolated and misunderstood.

One day, an old wise man came to the village, and they brought the boy to him. The wise man told the boy a story about how darkness is like a spider. The spider is also afraid of humans because we crush them with ease. In the same way, darkness is afraid of us because we can bring light to dispel it.

The wise man then showed the boy how to make a candle. The boy's eyes lit up as he carefully crafted the candle himself. When he was finished, he lit it with a matchstick, and the candle sent rays of light to every corner of his room.

The boy was amazed by the power of light. He felt brave, and his fear of the dark was gone. He even started to explore the village at night, armed with his own light, and found a newfound love for the stars twinkling above.

Now all the villagers come to the wise man to learn how to make candles. The village glows at night, and everyone feels safer and happier. The darkness is no longer something to fear because the villagers know they have the power to bring light to dispel it.
