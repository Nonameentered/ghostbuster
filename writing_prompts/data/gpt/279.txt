You are a stenographer (professional typist) hired by a wealthy but dysfunctional couple to type all the various arguments they have throughout the day.
I sat poised in my chair, fingers at the ready over the keyboard. My new clients, Mr. and Mrs. Johnson, were a wealthy but dysfunctional couple who had hired me to document their daily arguments. It was certainly an unusual request, but I was a professional typist, and I never questioned the oddities of my clients’ requests.

The first argument of the day came quickly, barely ten minutes after I arrived at their luxurious estate. I could hear their raised voices even before they entered the sitting room where I was waiting. Mr. Johnson strode in first, his face red and contorted with annoyance. His wife, Mrs. Johnson, followed, her eyes flashing in anger.

“What could be so important that you can’t be bothered to pick up the phone?” Mr. Johnson barked at his wife.

“I was busy with my charity work,” Mrs. Johnson retorted. “I didn’t hear the phone ring.”

“Your charity work is always more important than our marriage,” Mr. Johnson sneered.

And so it went, the argument escalating until Mr. Johnson stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind him. I typed furiously throughout, capturing every word of the heated exchange. The Johnsons paid me well for this service, and I intended to deliver nothing less than perfection.

As the day wore on, I became more and more accustomed to the Johnsons’ unique dynamic. They argued over everything, from what to have for lunch to who was responsible for a broken vase in the dining room. Each argument was more intense than the last, with both parties determined to have the last word.

Despite the constant bickering, I couldn’t help but feel a certain admiration for the Johnsons. They may have been volatile and argumentative, but they were also fiercely passionate about everything they did. I couldn’t help but wonder if their constant arguments were evidence of a deeper, more complex love.

As evening came around and the Johnsons’ arguments began to dwindle, I packed up my things and bid them goodnight. I had managed to document over twenty arguments throughout the course of the day, and I knew that my work was far from over.

Over the next few weeks, I spent hours upon hours typing up lengthy transcripts of the Johnsons’ arguments. As I worked, I began to learn more and more about their lives, their hopes, and their fears. It was strange to feel such a deep connection to people who I had barely spoken a word to, but I couldn’t help it - I felt like I knew them intimately.

When Mrs. Johnson called me to her office one day, I didn’t know what to expect. She greeted me with a smile, thanking me for my work and handing me an envelope stuffed with money.

“I’m afraid that will be all, dear,” she said, her voice soft. “We’ve decided to try couples therapy instead of arguing all the time.”

I felt a pang of sadness at the thought of no longer documenting the Johnsons’ arguments. Still, I couldn’t help but feel a certain satisfaction at the knowledge that my work may have helped them toward a more peaceful, loving relationship.

As I left the Johnsons’ estate for the final time, I couldn’t help but reflect on the unlikely bond that I had formed with the couple. They may have been dysfunctional, but they were still human beings with real emotions and real struggles. And I had been there to document it all.
