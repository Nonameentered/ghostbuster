SatChat: Do you use world building for your stories?
As a writer, I always use world building in my stories. It's impossible to tell a compelling story without creating a believable world for the characters to inhabit.

In my latest project, I've spent hours researching and developing the culture of a fictional civilization. From their beliefs and customs to the architecture of their buildings, every detail is important. It's these details that bring the story to life and make it feel authentic.

I've even created a map of their world, with detailed descriptions of each region and its unique features. This helps me visualize the story as if I were there myself.

World building isn't just about creating a stage for the characters to act on. It's about creating a living, breathing world that readers will want to explore. By putting in the effort to develop a detailed and believable world, I hope to draw readers into my story and keep them hooked until the very end.
