I always feared death. That is, until I died myself. My name is Alice, and this is my story.

I remember the accident vividly. I was driving home from work on a dark and stormy night. The rain was pouring down like cats and dogs, and the lightning illuminated the sky every few seconds. I was in a hurry to get home due to a family emergency, and so I was driving faster than usual.

Suddenly, I saw something out of the corner of my eye. It was a deer, and it had jumped out onto the road in front of me. I slammed on the brakes, but it was too late. My car skidded out of control and hit a tree.

The next thing I know, I am floating upwards towards a bright light. I feel a sense of peace and tranquility that I had never experienced before. I knew I was dead, and I had accepted it.

As I move closer to the light, I feel a presence behind me. It is warm and comforting, like a hug from a loved one. I turn around to see who it is, and to my surprise, it is my grandmother. She passed away a few years ago, and I had been heartbroken ever since.

"Grandma?" I ask, surprised.

"Yes, my dear," she replies, smiling. "I've been waiting for you. Welcome to the afterlife."

I cannot believe what I am seeing. Is this real? Am I really dead? But the sense of peace and the comfort of my grandmother's presence reassure me that this is not a dream.

We walk towards the light, and as we get closer, I see that it is an immense marble archway. On each side of the arch, there are two towering figures made of pure light. I speculate that they are angels.

As we step through the archway, I see a vast expanse of white light. It is brighter than the sun, but it doesn't hurt my eyes or give off any heat. It is a different kind of light- a light of clarity, purity, and wisdom.

"Where are we?" I ask my grandmother, as we walk further towards the light.

"We are in heaven," she replies. "This is where the souls of the good go after they die."

I am overwhelmed by the beauty of the place. There are gardens filled with flowers of all colours, and trees that emanate a sweet fragrance. There are fountains streaming with crystal water, and birds flying in the sky that are a rainbow of colours. It is everything I imagined heaven to be and more.

"My child," my grandmother says, interrupting my thoughts. "You have a choice to make. You can go back to your life on Earth, or you can stay here in heaven."

I hesitate for a moment, unsure of what to choose. I had never been given a choice before, especially not one like this.

"If I stay here, will I be happy?" I ask my grandmother.

"You will be surrounded by peace, love, and light. But you will be away from your family and friends on Earth," she replies.

I take a deep breath and consider my options. I could stay in this eternal paradise and never have to worry about anything again. Or, I could go back to my life and try to make the best of the time I have left.

"I want to go back," I say, finally making my decision.

My grandmother nods and smiles at me. "I knew you would make the right choice."

As we walk back towards the archway, I feel a sense of hesitation. Is this what I really want? But something in my heart tells me that I am making the right decision.

I wake up in a hospital bed, surrounded by my family members. My parents are crying, and my sister is holding my hand tightly.

"Oh, thank God you're okay," my sister says, relieved.

"What happened?" I ask, still groggy from the medication.

"You were in a car accident," my mom says, wiping away her tears. "The doctors said that you were in critical condition, but you're a fighter. You managed to pull through."

As I start to recall the events of the accident, I begin to wonder if it was all real. Was heaven just a figment of my imagination?

But then I notice something strange on my hand. There is a white unblemished scar on it, in the shape of a cross. I know that this is the mark of proof that I had died and come back to life. I begin to cry, overwhelmed by the emotions that are running through me.

I had faced my greatest fear and come back stronger than before. Now I live my life with a new perspective, cherishing every moment and living each day as if it were my last. Whether I end up in heaven or in the ground, I know that I will have lived my life to the fullest.
