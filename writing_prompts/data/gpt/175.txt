You have the ability to possess dragons.
Ever since she was a child, Lily had a fascination with dragons. She would sneak out of her house at night just to watch them fly across the sky. And then one day, she discovered she had the ability to possess them. 

At first, it was a daunting task. It took all her strength to control even one dragon, but as time went on, she became more skilled. Soon, she was able to possess multiple dragons at once. 

It wasn't long before word got out about her abilities. The king of the neighboring kingdom offered her a position as the head of his dragon army. She agreed and soon became one of the most powerful women in the land. 

She led her dragons into battle, each one obediently following her every command. The enemies were devastated with their fiery attacks. 

Lily had never felt more alive than when she was soaring above the clouds, her heart beating with the wings of the dragons. She knew that wherever she went, she would always have a loyal army by her side.
