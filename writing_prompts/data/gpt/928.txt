The Big Bad was having a terrible day. It seemed like everything was going wrong. His minions were bickering and fighting among themselves. The castle was falling apart, and he had to spend all his time dealing with his employees' petty complaints.

He had just finished a long day of meetings when he received an urgent message from his second-in-command. The Little Wolf had been caught trying to sneak into the castle, and the guards had captured him.

The Big Bad sighed and made his way to the dungeon, where he found the Little Wolf sitting sullenly in his cell. "What do you want, Little Wolf?" he asked.

"I came to talk to you," replied the Little Wolf. "I don't want to fight anymore."

The Big Bad rolled his eyes. "I don't have time for this. What do you want?"

"I want to work with you," said the Little Wolf. "I know we've been enemies for a long time, but I think we could do great things together."

The Big Bad considered this for a moment. He had heard rumors of a group of powerful villains who were planning to take over the kingdom, and he knew he would need allies if he wanted to defend his territory.

"Fine," he said. "But you'll have to prove yourself to me first. And if you ever try to double-cross me, I'll make you wish you were never born."

The Little Wolf nodded vigorously. The Big Bad sighed and left the dungeon, feeling exhausted and frustrated. This was just another one of the countless problems he had to deal with every day. But he knew that if he wanted to stay in power, he would have to keep putting up with it.
