Ever since you were born you've possessed the power to teleport wherever you're currently looking. Depressed and unsatisfied, you decide to end your life by looking towards the stars. You're not dead.
Ever since I can remember, I have possessed the power to teleport wherever I am currently looking. It might seem like a cool superpower for some people, but for me, it was more of a curse. I was always running away from my problems, and teleportation was my escape. I never had to face anything in my life; all I needed to do was look at somewhere else, and I would be there.

However, lately, my life has been dull and mundane. I've been feeling depressed and unsatisfied with my existence. I have been teleporting around the world, but no matter where I went, my problems would always follow me. It was as if I was running in a circle.

One night, while sitting in my apartment, I reached out for a decision. It was either I continued living in this monotonous cycle, running from my problems, or take a drastic step by ending my life. I had lost all hope and thought that if there was some sort of afterlife, it would be better than what I was facing at that moment.

I decided to end my life by looking up at the stars. It was symbolic in a way; the stars represented hope, freedom, and an escape from this world. I stood on my balcony, closed my eyes, and took a deep breath. I told myself that this was it; I would teleport to the stars and end my life.

I opened my eyes and found myself standing on the same balcony. I looked around, confused. I had never experienced failure in my power, but this time, it didn't work.

I tried again, focusing harder this time, but to no avail. I was still standing on the same balcony, looking at the same old concrete jungle. Frustration and anxiety started to set in, and tears rolled down my eyes. "Why am I still here?" I yelled out into the quiet night.

Suddenly, I heard a voice. "Did you really think it would be that easy?" It was as if the voice was coming from within me, and it sounded familiar. I looked around, but I was alone on the balcony.

"Who are you?" I asked, looking around, but there was no reply.

I went back to my room, but the voice stayed with me. It was as if it was guiding me, telling me that I still had hope. I didn't know what to make of it, but the voice was comforting. It gave me some kind of hope, something I had lost a long time ago.

As days passed by, I started to realize that my powers weren't the answer to my problems. I had been running away all my life but had never faced my demons. I had to confront them head-on.

With the help of the voice, I started working towards changing my life. I went to therapy, faced my fears, and started to take control of my life. It wasn't easy, but the voice inside me kept pushing me.

Months later, I found myself standing on my balcony, looking at the same stars I had once thought would be the end of me. But this time, I wasn't looking at them with the intention of escaping them. I was looking at them with hope, knowing that I had conquered my fears, and I was stronger than ever.

I realized that my power wasn't about running away; it was about being able to see different perspectives. I had the power to see the world in a new light, and that was a gift. All this time, I had been taking it for granted.

Life wasn't perfect, but I was okay with that. I had found hope and strength in myself, and that was enough. I didn't need to run away anymore. I had embraced life, and it felt better than anything I had ever known.

Today, as I look back, I cannot believe that I had once thought of ending my life. I had not only lost hope, but I had lost myself too. But now, thanks to the power I was blessed with, I had come out stronger and more resilient. I had found hope, and that was all I needed.
