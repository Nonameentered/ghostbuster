You just got fired, you're pretty sure your girlfriend is cheating on you, you're 75k in student loans debt, rent was due last week, and to top it all off? You're all out of beer. Oddly enough, you just got an email titled 'Would you like to change the difficulty? Current setting: Very Hard.'
John blinked at the email, trying to make sense of it. He knew his life was a mess, but what did this email mean? Suddenly, a small button appeared on the screen with the words 'Yes' and 'No.' John hesitated, but eventually clicked 'Yes.'

All of a sudden, his surroundings began to shift, like the world was a video game changing levels. The weight on his shoulders lifted, and he felt a strange sense of power. He replayed the email in his mind and suddenly got it - it was like a virtual setting, where he could change the difficulty of his life.

John felt a sense of relief, knowing that the hard times had passed. It was a strange feeling, but he didn't question it too much. Instead, he decided to see where this new difficulty led him. Suddenly, his phone rang, and he answered, only to hear his dream job and a girl confessing her love for him. It was as if the universe had heard his pleas and had changed the difficulty setting just for him.
