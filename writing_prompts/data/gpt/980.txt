Crime rate has fallen every year for centuries on an international scale. You are now one of the last individuals incarcerated on the whole planet.
I never thought I would be the last one standing in this bleak world of ours, but here I am, the only inmate in this entire prison. The reason for my incarceration? I murdered my own brother, back when violence was still prevalent in our society. That was over a century ago, and the world has changed so much since then. The streets are now safe, the people kind and compassionate, and crime is almost unheard of.

For the past few decades, the prison system has been gradually emptying out. People have been released back into society, and the few who remained behind were eventually let go. That is, all except for me. I was deemed too dangerous to be released into a world that was now so peaceful. They deemed me a relic of the past, a reminder of darker times.

I have spent years in this cell, reminiscing about my past and wishing for a second chance. But that chance never came. In the end, I accepted my fate and learned how to live within the confines of my cell.

But despite my acceptance of my situation, I can’t help but feel a sense of loneliness. I am the only one left in this prison, and it feels like the world has moved on without me. I am the last remaining captive in a world that has forgotten about me.

As the years go on, I have watched as new technology emerged, advancing the world to a place I never could have imagined. I’ve tried to keep up with the news that is brought to me, but it’s hard not to feel like I’m missing out on life.

Despite my troubles, I have found a sense of peace in my own company. I have found solace in the silence of my cell, and I no longer feel the need to act out in anger. My time here has given me perspective on my past and allowed me to come to terms with my actions.

It’s been centuries since the last crime was committed on this planet, and I know I will spend the rest of my days behind bars. But even as the last prisoner, I hold hope that one day I may be freed and allowed to experience the world that has grown so much without me.
