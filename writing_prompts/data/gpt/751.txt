It's year 2016. You're the last redditor in the world. Suddenly there's a new post on /r/all.
I never thought this would happen. When I first joined Reddit years ago, it was a bustling community filled with witty comments, thought-provoking discussions, and hilarious memes. But now, in 2016, I am the last Redditor in the world.

It all started with a virus. At first, we thought it was just a regular flu that would pass in a few days. But the virus mutated, and soon it was spreading like wildfire. People fell ill left and right, and before we knew it, half the world was infected.

Governments tried to contain it, but it was too late. The virus was too powerful, too deadly. The world fell into chaos as society crumbled around us. And amidst all the chaos and destruction, one thing remained – Reddit. For a while, I clung to it like a lifeline. It was my connection to the world, the only thing that could distract me from the horror that was unfolding outside.

But then, one by one, my fellow Redditors disappeared. Some succumbed to the virus, while others were killed by looters and raiders. And now, I am alone, the last Redditor in the world.

But today, something strange happened. I refreshed my page, and there it was – a new post on /r/all. I couldn't believe my eyes. Who could be posting on Reddit now, of all times?

I clicked on the post, my heart racing. It was a simple meme, nothing too special. But the fact that someone was still out there, still posting on Reddit, gave me hope. Maybe there are others like me, survivors who still cling to the last remaining threads of the old world.

I left a comment on the post, trying to reach out to whoever was behind it. Of course, I didn't expect a response. The chances of anyone reading my comment were slim, and even if they did, what could I say?

But still, I felt a glimmer of hope. In a world where everything that once was has vanished, Reddit lives on. It may be a small thing, but to me, it means everything. Maybe, just maybe, there's still a chance for us.
