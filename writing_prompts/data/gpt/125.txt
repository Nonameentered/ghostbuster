Death made their weekly visit to the old man's home, settling into a chair and waiting for their usual conversation. They talked about life, memories, and mortality every week, and Death had grown fond of the old man's stories.

But this visit was different. Death knew that this would be their last conversation with the old man. The man was unaware of his impending death, and Death struggled to find the words to break the news.

As they talked, Death tried to steer the conversation towards the topic of mortality. "What do you think happens after we die?" they asked.

The old man shrugged. "I don't know. Maybe we go to heaven or hell, or maybe we just cease to exist."

Death nodded, silently agreeing with the man's words. They took a deep breath, preparing to tell the old man the truth.

"I...I have something to tell you," Death began. The old man looked up at them with a curious expression.

"I'm afraid that this will be our last visit. You will be joining me soon."

The old man's face dropped as he realized what Death meant. But Death held out a hand, offering comfort.

"Don't be afraid. Your time has come, but know that your stories and memories will live on. You will not be forgotten."

With those words, Death took the old man's hand, guiding him towards the afterlife. Though Death was saddened by the loss, they knew that the man had lived a full and meaningful life. And Death would always cherish their conversations, reminding them of the beauty and fragility of life.
