- In a short conversation with the devil a 7-year old child manages to do something god didn't manage in thousands of years.
Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who lived in a small village. She was only 7 years old but was wise beyond her years. She had a heart of gold and loved everyone she met. However, Lily had always been curious about the devil. She had heard stories about him from the elders of the village and was fascinated by him. She always wondered why God had created the devil if he was so evil.

One day, as Lily was playing by herself in the woods, she came across the devil sitting under a tree. He was surprised to see a small child wandering around the woods by herself. But Lily was not afraid. She walked up to him and introduced herself.

"Hello, Mr. Devil. My name is Lily. Can I sit next to you?"

The devil was intrigued by the little girl's courage and gestured for her to sit.

"Of course, Lily. What brings you to these parts? Shouldn't you be playing with your friends?"

"I was just exploring," replied Lily. "But I have to admit, meeting you was something I never thought would happen."

The devil chuckled. "Well, I'm flattered. Why are you so curious about me, little one?"

Lily looked at him with her big blue eyes and said, "I heard stories about you. People say that you tempt people to do evil things and that you're always up to no good. But I don't believe that. I think there's good in everyone, even you."

The devil was surprised by Lily's words. He had never met such an innocent child who saw good in him.

"I must admit, Lily, that you are quite wise for your age."

Lily smiled. "Thank you, Mr. Devil. I have a question for you. Why did God create you if you're so evil?"

The devil sighed and looked at the ground. "That is a question that has been asked for thousands of years. Some say that God created me to test the strength of mankind. Others say that I am a punisher of sinners. But I believe that I am what people make of me. If they choose to do evil, then I am seen as the source of their trouble. But if they choose to do good, then they see me as nothing more than a figment of their imagination."

Lily looked at the devil with her innocent eyes and said with determination, "I refuse to believe that God created you to be evil. I believe that you were created with a purpose, just like everyone else. And I know that there's good inside of you. I can see it."

The devil was touched by Lily's words. He had never met someone who had seen him in a different light. Lily's words gave him hope that he could change his ways.

"Thank you, Lily. It means a lot that you have faith in me."

They sat there for a while longer, talking about life and the world around them. But soon it was time for Lily to go back home.

As she walked away, the devil called out to her, "Lily, wait!"

She turned around, and the devil said, "You've done something that God couldn't do in thousands of years. You saw beyond my reputation, and you saw the good in me. And for that, I thank you."

Lily smiled and said, "It's easy to see the good in people, even if they don't see it themselves."

And with that, Lily walked away, knowing that she had made a difference in someone's life. She had shown the devil that there was still hope for him, that he could change his ways, and that he was not all evil. From that day on, the devil looked at the world in a different light, hoping that he could one day be seen as something more than just a temptation.
