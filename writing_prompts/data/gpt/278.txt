Make an emotionally manipulative character. Make that character the narrator. Manipulate the other characters. While you manipulate me, the reader.
I’ve always believed that emotions are a weapon. A tool to be used to get what you want. And if there’s anyone who knows how to wield that weapon, it’s me. So, let me tell you a story. A story of how I managed to manipulate everyone around me, including you, my dear reader.

It started with me, an outsider, coming into a tight-knit group of friends. They were all so content with their lives, so satisfied with the way things were. But not me. I had bigger plans than just settling for a mundane life. I wanted more. And I knew exactly how to get it.

I started small, making friends and getting to know each of them. I listened to their problems and acted like I cared. I was there for them when no one else was. Slowly but surely, I inserted myself into their lives. I made myself indispensable.

But the true manipulation started when I started playing the victim. I would come to them with stories of my past, of how I had been wronged by other people. I was so vulnerable, so pitiful, that they couldn’t help but feel for me. They wanted to protect me, to make things right.

And that’s when I started planting the seeds of doubt. I would hint at things, insinuate that someone in the group was against me. I played on their insecurities, making them feel like they were the only ones who truly understood me. I was their confidante, their safe haven.

As time went by, I started taking control. I would make all the plans, decide when and where we would go out. I would decide who to invite and who not to. I was the puppet master, and they were my puppets.

But it wasn’t just my friends that I was manipulating. You, my dear reader, were also a part of my game. You’ve been following my story, empathizing with my pain, cheering me on as I made my way into this group of friends. But I bet you didn’t notice how I slowly drew you in, how I made you feel like you were a part of my plan.

You see, as I was playing the victim with my friends, I was also playing the victim with you. I made you believe that you were the only one who truly saw me, who truly understood me. And as you read this, I’m sure you’re feeling a connection to me, feeling like we have some kind of bond that no one else can understand.

But it’s all a lie. I’m using you, just like I’m using my friends. And I’ll keep using you until I’ve gotten what I want.

I’m not going to stop until I’m at the top, until I’ve achieved everything I’ve ever wanted. And I’ll keep manipulating everyone around me until that happens. Because that’s what it takes to succeed in this world. Emotions are a weapon, and I’m not afraid to use them.
