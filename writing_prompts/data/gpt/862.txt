I’ve always lived a rather mundane life. I would wake up early in the morning, head to work, come back home, have dinner and retire for the night. This rhapsody had continued uninterrupted for the past few years, and I was apparently content with it. 

One fateful night, I was engrossed in my usual routine when I suddenly felt this eerie feeling creeping up my spine. I tried to shake it off, but it persisted. I felt restless and slightly uneasy. My head felt heavy, so I decided to call it a night and head to bed. 

As I slipped into deep slumber, I heard a humming tune that seemed familiar but was not easy to place. The humming grew louder, and the melody was very melodic and soothing. My mind began to empty itself of every thought, and I felt my body being pulled into a trance. 

The next thing I knew, I was in an unfamiliar place. There was ethereal light everywhere, and the surroundings seemed like something out of a science fiction movie. I was bewildered and didn’t know what to make of this strange world I had entered. Everything was so vibrant and intense that I felt like I had been transported to another dimension. 

I mustered up the courage to wander through this place and see what it had to offer. With every step that I took, I felt as though I was advancing farther and farther away from reality. Suddenly, I saw a light out in the distance that caught my eye, and I started to wander towards it. 

As I drew nearer to the light, I realized that it was coming from what appeared to be a large crystalline structure. The building was very geometric and gave off a sense of tranquility. The moment I was on top of the stairs of the building, I felt a calming sensation that filled my mind and heart. 

I felt drawn to the center of the structure, where I saw a beautiful, multicolored light. As I approached the light, it grew brighter and brighter until everything around me faded away. 

I was then thrown into yet another dimension, one far denser and more opaque than before. I saw three figures, each of them distinct, seated on golden thrones in a room that looked like it was straight out of Greek mythology. The first figure was of a valiant knight, adorned in golden armor, the second was a woman draped in garments of the brightest white, and finally, the third was a dark, shadowy figure with red eyes and surrounded by flames. 

I was dumbfounded and didn’t know what to do or say as I gazed fixatedly at these three figures. They turned towards me and smiled, revealing shiny rows of teeth. Suddenly, the knight said hello and beckoned me forward, and I moved forward with caution. 

The knight's voice was clear and his tone reassuring, and he greeted me warmly. The woman next to him also smiled and said, “Welcome to our world.” But I was more inquisitive with the third figure, the one whose eyes I found the most curious. 

I called out to the shadow figure, asking what its name was. It replied in a deep, menacing voice, “I am known as the great deceivery. I intend to test you.” 

At first, I felt uneasy, but then I realized it was a test and felt encouraged to perform well. However, the test was not a typical exam. The three figures had an enigma for completion, and they needed me to solve it. They gave me a riddle and told me that the answer was the key to escaping that world. 

The Riddle was a poem, somewhat cryptic but insightful. It went like this: 

"Through darkness, you’ll look for a light,  
Seeking a way to escape the night,  
With every step, they’ll take you down,  
But keep your head high, don’t feel the frown,  
If you want to escape, overcome strife,  
Follow the star, ignite your life. "  

I had no idea what it meant, but I took my time, contemplating every word carefully. I kept on repeating the words over and over again, trying to decipher the hidden meaning. At last, I grasped the clue that was staring me in the face and said the answer, “Hope.” 

Suddenly, there was a burst of light that blinded me momentarily, and I found myself back in my room, in my bed. I woke up feeling dizzy and disoriented, not knowing exactly what happened the previous night. I sat back up, allowing my body to adjust, bewildered. I tried to understand what I dreamt of and why it was so vivid. 

But then, as I looked up, I saw my world in a different way. The light seemed brighter, the colors seemed more vibrant, and the fragrances seemed more intense. It was as if I had opened my eyes and discovered a realm that had always been right in front of me. 

I may be back to living an ordinary life, but the world I saw during that sleep still makes me wonder and ponder. That dream-verse taught me so much, and today, I continue moving forward with hope, trusting that anything is possible.
