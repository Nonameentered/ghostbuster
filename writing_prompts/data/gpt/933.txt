Adam and Eve want to make children, but they have no idea how to get started. (NSFW)
Adam and Eve had everything they could have ever wanted in their perfect little garden. The only thing they were missing was their own little bundle of joy to enjoy everything with. They had tried everything to have a child, but nothing seemed to work.

One day, they decided to confide in someone they trusted, the serpent. "Serpent, can you teach us how to have a child?" they asked.

The serpent replied, "Of course, dear friends. Come with me."

The serpent led them to a forbidden tree and told them to eat the fruit from its branches. "It will give you the knowledge you seek," the serpent said.

Adam and Eve hesitated. The fruit was forbidden, and they didn't want to anger their Creator. But they wanted a child so badly that they decided to take their chances and eat the fruit.

As they took a bite, a rush of knowledge flooded over them. Suddenly, they knew everything they needed to know about making a child.

Excitedly, they went back to their garden and got started. Adam was nervous and fumbling at first. Eve giggled and took charge, showing him what to do. They laughed and played and explored each other's bodies until they found a rhythm that felt just right.

As they lay together in a tangled pile, Adam spoke up. "Eve, how will we know if it worked?"

Eve smiled and said, "I have a feeling. I just know."

A few weeks later, Eve was feeling unwell. Adam gathered herbs and brought them to her, trying to soothe her sickness. But it only continued to get worse. They knew that something wasn't right.

Eve went to the serpent again, pleading, “Our child is sick, please help us!”

The serpent explained that their child was sick because they had disobeyed their Creator's command not to eat from the forbidden fruit. They were cursed now, doomed to a life of pain and struggle as their punishment.

But the serpent also told them there was a way out. They could dance under the full moon and offer their child as a sacrifice. Only then would they be forgiven and blessed with more kids.

Adam and Eve looked at each other, then at the serpent. They didn't want to lose their child, but they also didn't want to be punished forever.

The full moon rose in the sky, and they followed the serpent's instructions. They danced and chanted and offered their child up to the heavens. A bright light shone down upon them, and they felt the forgiveness that they had been seeking.

The next morning, Eve woke up feeling better than she had in weeks. She jumped up and ran to Adam, her eyes shining with excitement. "Adam, it worked!" she cried.

Adam was overjoyed. He hugged Eve tightly and said, "We did it! We made a baby!"

As the months passed, Eve grew rounder and rounder, her belly swollen with their child. They were thrilled and nervous, excited and scared. They didn't know what to expect but they were ready for anything.

One night, Eve went into labor. Adam did his best to help her through it, holding her hand and wiping her brow. When their baby was born, they cried with happiness. It was a beautiful, healthy little girl.

As they held their child and gazed into her bright blue eyes, they knew that they would do anything to protect her and keep her safe. It was a promise they made to each other, to their Creator, and most importantly, to their child.

From that day forward, they raised their child in the garden, surrounded by love and light and the beauty of the earth. They knew that they had been blessed with something special, something more precious than anything else in the world. They had created life, and it was the most beautiful thing they had ever accomplished in their perfect little garden.
