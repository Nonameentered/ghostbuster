Ever since I was a child, I knew I had a purpose in life – to bring down the evil Empire that had plagued our world for far too long. I knew that I could not do it alone, so I spent my entire life infiltrating the Empire, rising through the ranks until I was finally appointed as the Emperor's right-hand. I had access to all the inner workings, the secret files, and the Emperor's plans. I planned their downfall, meticulously, with one false move that could undo all my work.

I knew every secret of the Empire, but I had to act as if I was loyal to them. I had to act like I was always working towards their best interests, even if it meant going against my own morals. But I persisted, knowing that this was the only way to bring them down from the inside. I worked with the rebels, supplied them with information, and helped them plan their attacks.

Years had gone by, and I had almost given up hope. I had grown comfortable in the position of the Emperor's right-hand, but the fire that burned within me never diminishing. I knew that this was the calm before the storm and that the day of reckoning was coming.

And finally, it did. The day arrived when we had planned to overthrow the Empire. The rebels were ready, and I was waiting for the perfect moment to intervene. The Emperor was in his chambers, going over the latest reports when I entered. I had a weapon in my hand, ready to strike. The Emperor looked up, greeting me with a smile, and I had to fight the urge to vomit. I pulled the trigger, but my gun jammed. The Emperor looked at me, puzzled.

"What's the matter? Why are you just standing there?" he asked me. Then out of nowhere, a hero appeared, sword in hand, and before I could even react, he had swung it, killing the Emperor instantly.

I was stunned, confused, and heartbroken. I had spent my entire life planning for this moment, only to have it stolen by this hero, who had just arrived out of nowhere. I looked at him, uncomprehendingly – who was he? Why did he do it? But he just smiled at me, "I knew you were waiting for me to act," he said. "I am the hero your cause needed."

I was speechless. The rebels had begun their bombardment, taking over the Palace. The guards started yelling, and my mind raced, trying to come up with a plan. I had to act fast, or my cover would be blown. The hero would soon realize that I had been working with the Empire all along. 

And true enough, he did. "You!" he yelled, pointing his sword at me. "You're the one who's been helping the Empire, aren't you?" I could see the anger in his eyes, his sword quivering with rage. He thought that I had betrayed him, but the truth was that I had been trying to aid him all along. 

But I had to keep my composure. "No," I replied calmly. "I was looking for the perfect moment to strike."

He looked at me skeptically, but I knew that he wouldn't take the risk, not with the forces of the Empire closing in on us. We had to escape, and fast. The rebels had won, but we were still not safe. 

We ran through the corridors, dodging the Imperial soldiers, and emerging triumphantly from the Palace. The hero and I were the only ones left standing. I was trying to explain to him what happened, but all he did was glare at me. I could see that he was unwilling to accept that I had been working on the same side all along.

As we made our way towards the awaiting transport, I knew that it was all over. My life's work had been undone in a blink of an eye. The Empire was no more, but the hero had taken all the credit. Everyone around us cheered, giving him the credit that I had worked so hard to earn.

But I couldn't help but feel angry, frustrated, and confused. I had dedicated my entire life to this cause, and the hero had just swooped in and taken everything away from me. I was the one who helped to bring down the Empire, but it was the hero who got all the glory.

Years have gone by, and I have since retired from my role as the Emperor's right-hand. I watch from a distance as the hero is celebrated, showered with praise, and adoration. And yet, I can't help but feel a tinge of bitterness in my heart. For I know that history will never speak of me, never mentioning my role in the Empire's downfall.

But as I look back on my life, I realize that I never did it for the glory. I did it because it was right. I did it to bring about a change, to rid the world of evil and tyranny. And maybe that's what really matters – that I did what was right, even if nobody ever knows.
