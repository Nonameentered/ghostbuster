You are the antagonist in a story. You think. You really aren't sure anymore after what the protagonist did.
I used to be so sure of myself. I was the antagonist in this story; I was the one causing all the problems and making everyone's lives a living hell. Well, at least that's what I thought. But now, things have changed. I'm not sure if I'm still the bad guy or if I've become the victim.

You see, the protagonist did something that changed everything. Something that made me question my own motives and my own actions. Something that made me realize that maybe, just maybe, I wasn't so bad after all.

I don't want to go into details, but let's just say that the protagonist did something truly terrible. Something that not even I would have ever considered. And now I'm left wondering if they were the villain all along.

It's a confusing feeling, to say the least. I'm not sure who I am anymore or what my purpose is in this story. All I know is that things have changed, and it's a scary feeling. But maybe, just maybe, it's for the best. Maybe now I can finally see that there are no clear-cut roles in life, and sometimes the lines between good and evil can be blurred.
