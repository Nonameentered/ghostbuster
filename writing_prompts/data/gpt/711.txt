I had never known about my character creation before I was born until the moment I died. Suddenly, it became clear that I had made all the wrong choices in my life because of how I had been created.

Looking back, I realized that I was given a gift with words. I had always been able to talk my way out of situations, but instead of using my gift for good, I used it to deceive and manipulate those around me. My natural skills were wasted, and I had spent my life fooling others for my own benefit.

My virtues were compassion and kindness. Yet, I had always been selfish, only thinking of myself and never showing empathy towards others. I had not helped those in need even when I could have, instead, I had focused on my own desires.

My attributes were intelligence and agility, but I had never used them to their full potential. I had never tried to develop my mind to its fullest extent, nor had I taken on any challenges that would have allowed me to grow.

It was too late to change anything in this life, but perhaps in the next. I would be more mindful of the character creation process, and I would make sure to use my gifts for good. I could only hope that my new life would be one of redemption and change.
