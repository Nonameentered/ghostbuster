As a child, Sarah was always fearful of the dark. She would cling onto her mother's arm, begging for the light to be switched back on. But that was nothing compared to the fear she felt when her mother died.

Sarah tried to hide her grief, locking away the tears and the pain. But eventually, she grew tired of pretending that everything was okay. The grief spilled out of her, like an overflowing river, and soon everyone around her was affected by the darkness that plagued her.

As time passed, Sarah tried to keep her grief under control, but it was too strong for her to handle. The darkness swirled around her, tainting the once-beautiful countryside until it became a wasteland of despair.

Sarah was ashamed of the destruction that she had caused, and vowed that she would keep her pain locked away in her heart. She spent years trying to rebuild the landscape that she had destroyed, but it never quite returned to its former glory.

The lesson that Sarah learned was that it is important to cope with pain in a healthy way. Ignoring what is inside you will only hurt yourself and everyone around you. There is always someone out there willing to lend an ear and help you through your struggles.
