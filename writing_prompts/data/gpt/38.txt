Gay marriage is now legal woldwide, and the conservatives were right all along. Everyone is turning gay, as if it was a pseudo zombie apocalypse. You are one of the surviors, trying to survive in this new world.
When the news broke that gay marriage was legal worldwide, the conservatives were smugly satisfied. They always knew that this was the slippery slope that would lead to the downfall of society. What they didn't anticipate was the sheer speed at which it would happen - as if a switch had been flipped, the world descended into an almost pseudo zombie apocalypse.

At first, it was small things. Colleagues and old friends would come out as gay, or disclose that they had always been so but remained in the closet for fear of persecution. Soon after, it was almost as if the floodgates had been opened and people were coming out in droves - celebrities, politicians, athletes and even your next-door neighbour. The world seemed to be losing its mind in the mad rush to embrace same-sex love.

But amidst the flurry of rainbow parades and love-ins, survivors like you were the ones left behind. You watched as the world imploded around you, as every aspect of society bent to the will of this new way of life. You were neither gay nor straight - but somehow, in this new world, that made you even more of an outsider.

As the years went by, you struggled to survive in this new world. You watched as the population dwindled, eaten alive by a plague that no one could quite explain. And you wondered, as you lay dying, if the conservatives were right after all.
