You wake up from a good night's sleep and head to your bathroom where you notice your reflection has their arms crossed with an annoyed expression. The reflection says'We need to talk'.
I woke up feeling incredibly refreshed and energized from a fantastic night's sleep. I got out of bed and made my way to the bathroom, embracing the new day with vigor. My enthusiastic mood quickly dissipated when I noticed my reflection in the mirror.

My reflection was in an annoyed stance, arms crossed, glaring at me with an expression that made me feel like I had done something wrong. Confused, I stepped closer, unsure of what I had done to deserve such a look of contempt.

"We need to talk," my reflection said in a stern tone. I recoiled in fear, quickly realizing that whatever was about to happen wasn't going to be positive.

"Sorry, what did you say?" I stuttered nervously, unsure if I was ready for what was coming next.

"I said, we need to talk," my reflection repeated, this time with a colder tone.

I began to wonder if I had lost my mind. Was I really talking to myself in the reflection, or was this some kind of bizarre hallucination?

"I don't understand," I responded. "What do we need to talk about?"

"About how you're not living your life the way you should be," my reflection said. "You're not taking enough risks. You're too comfortable, and it's holding you back from reaching your full potential."

I was shocked by what I was hearing. Was my reflection really telling me that I was playing it safe in life, and not pushing myself enough? It was a tough pill to swallow.

As I stood there in the bathroom, I realized that my reflection was right. I had been living my life on autopilot, taking the easy road, and not pushing myself to achieve my dreams. It was time for me to start taking risks and living life to the fullest.

"Thank you for bringing this to my attention," I said to my reflection, feeling a newfound sense of motivation course through my veins.

"You're welcome," my reflection said, smiling at me for the first time. "Now go out there and make your dreams a reality."
