Once upon a time, there was a toy boat named Captain Red, who lived in a little boy's room. One day, the little boy took Captain Red to the beach to play. The boy forgot about him and left him sitting in the sand by the water. Suddenly, a big wave came and carried Captain Red out to sea.

As Captain Red floated out to sea, he was very scared. The waves were very big, and he didn't know how to navigate them. However, he decided he must be brave and try his best. He found a current going in the direction of a beautiful island, and he rode it all the way.

As he approached the shore of the island, he noticed a pod of fierce dolphins were jumping in and out of waves. Captain Red was frightened, but he remembered he was a brave toy boat. Suddenly, one of the dolphins pushed him to the coast. Captain Red had made it!

Though it was a great adventure, Captain Red was happy to be back home. The little boy had been worried he would never see Captain Red again, and was happy to have his toy boat returned to him. Captain Red may be just a toy, but he will always be remembered as a brave boat who sailed through dangerous seas to find his way home.
