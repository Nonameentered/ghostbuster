I had almost forgotten about the time capsule that I and my friends had buried behind the tree in my backyard. It was something that we had done on the last day of middle school, before we all went our separate ways. Now, five years later, I had decided to dig it up and relive those memories.

As I dug through the dirt, I could feel the excitement building up inside me. My hands were trembling with anticipation. Finally, after laboring for a good twenty minutes, I felt a hard object. I dug around it carefully, and there it was, the time capsule.

I lifted it out of the ground and placed it on the grass. As I opened it up, I found a phone lying at the bottom of the capsule. It was surreal. What was a phone doing here, buried underground for five years?

Curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to switch it on. It had enough battery life left to display a few messages. But before I could do anything, the phone started ringing. I gulped, wondering who the caller could possibly be. Hesitantly, I answered the phone.

"Hello!" I said, my voice shaking with surprise.

"Hi, is this Robert?" asked the voice on the other end.

I hesitated before answering. "Yes, who is this?"

"It's me, Emma, your friend from middle school. You remember me, right?"

As Emma's name registered in my mind, the memories of middle school came flooding back to me. Emma was the quiet, shy girl from my science class who was always lost in thoughts.

"Yes, I remember you, Emma. How are you doing?"

"I'm doing great, thanks for asking. I'm calling to remind you about our promise to meet on the last day of high school. I hope you haven't forgotten."

I was stupefied. I clearly remembered making that promise, but I had completely forgotten about it in the pressures of college and work.

"Omg, Emma, I completely forgot. You're right, we had promised to meet on the last day of high school. I'm so sorry."

"It's alright, don't worry about it. So, are you free?"

I checked my calendar and realized that I had a free day. "Yes, I'm free. Where do we meet?"

"How about the park where we buried the time capsule? It'll be like old times."

I smiled. "That sounds great. See you there."

As I replaced the phone back into the time capsule, I realized that sometimes, memories are not just things we remember. They are channels through which we can connect with people and relive those moments all over again.
