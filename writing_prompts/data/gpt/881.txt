In 2049, the world's first time machine had been invented. However, unlike the popular belief of preserving the timeline, the world leaders instead chose to establish the Time Improvement Agency (TIA) to improve history as much as possible. The TIA's primary role was to ensure that significant historical events were altered for the greater good, thereby creating a better future.

The TIA was headed by a renowned historian, Dr. Stephen Blum. He believed that history could be changed for the better, and the key was to monitor critical historical moments. He assembled a team of scientists, philosophers, and historians, all with the same goal of creating a better future.

Their first mission was to travel back to pre-World War I 1914, to prevent the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and prevent the outbreak of World War I. The team knew that the death of Ferdinand was the key event that led to the first world war, which claimed the lives of millions.

As the TIA agents landed in 1914, they quickly realized how challenging it was to solve the situation. They were strangers in a foreign world, and their presence and actions could create ripples in the timeline, adversely affecting the future.

Despite being faced with several obstacles, the team managed to shake off the initial setbacks and came up with a cunning plan. They approached the Serbian authorities, who had suspected assassins in their custody, and convinced them to hand them over for further investigation.

After checking the suspects, the team identified the assassin and thrwarted his plans, thereby, preventing the entire chain of events leading to the First World War.

Returning back to the present, they found their world to be vastly different. The effects of the war and its aftermath were non-existent as the TIA had effectively modified the past and created a better future.

Over time, the TIA went on to handle various missions, ranging from correcting other significant historical events like the Indian Revolution of 1857 to providing aid during natural disasters such as the 2004 Tsunami. They also played a crucial role in saving endangered species in the past, thereby, ensuring a better future for humanity and the planet.

As the years went by, the TIA became a well-oiled organization, always keeping an eye on specific historical events that might create chaos or negatively impact the future. Dr. Blum retired after 20 years of service, leaving behind a legacy and an agency that would continue to change history for the better.

However, there were still voices of dissent and ethical concerns about altering historical events. Some argued that it wasn't moral to change the past, even if it was for a better future, while others believed that the TIA's actions might have unintended consequences that could outweigh the benefits.

Finally, there were those who believed that man should not interfere with the natural course of events and that history unfold naturally, for better or for worse. Regardless of the arguments, the TIA continued its missions to alter history for the better, content with its role in changing the course of history and creating a better future for all humanity.
