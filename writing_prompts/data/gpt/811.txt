Sarah sat at her desk, scrolling through her unfinished comic strips. She had always wanted to be a webcomic writer, but had never found the time or inspiration to finish a strip. She sighed, feeling discouraged. That was until she came across a particularly captivating panel. A young girl sat alone on a park bench, staring at the empty space next to her. In the distance, a man approached with a lost look on his face. Sarah's mind began to race with ideas of who they were and what their story could be. With newfound motivation, she reached out for a webcomic writer.
