SatChat: What do you do in your writing that you feel is unique?
As a writer, I knew that my style of writing was unique. My writing was a reflection of my personality. I didn't follow any specific writing style or adhere to a particular format. I wrote my stories in my way, giving life to my imagination and ideas.

One thing that I did that I felt was unique was to add subtle humor to my stories. I did not want my writing to be too serious or boring. I wanted my readers to enjoy the story and have a good laugh while reading it. I felt that humor made my writing more relatable and memorable.

I also focused on creating characters that were not stereotypes. I tried to make them complex and realistic, with many flaws and quirks. This allowed my readers to connect with the characters on a deeper level.

Overall, I believed that my unique style of writing set my work apart from others and made it more enjoyable for my readers.
