I was one of the last two humans alive. My companion, Sarah, had been with me through it all; the sickness that spread across the world, the destruction of cities, the loss of life. But one day, Sarah didn't wake up. I was alone.

I spent my days scavenging for food and supplies, always on the move, always wary of danger. But as time went on, I began to feel the weight of solitude. No one to talk to, no one to share my experiences with. No one to keep me grounded.

I started thinking about Sarah, about our conversations, our laughter. How we promised to stick together until the end. And now I was left to carry on alone.

But I had to survive, for her. I had to keep going, for those who came before us and for those who may come after. I continued to forage for what I could find, and as I did, I felt a sense of purpose. I may be the only one left, but I'm not alone.
