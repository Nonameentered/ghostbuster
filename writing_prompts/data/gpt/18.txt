The alien army had been preparing for years, gathering their forces and honing their weaponry for the eventual attack on the human race. They had done their research, studying human behavior and tactics, and they were confident in their ability to take them down. But as they launched their assault, they quickly realized that they had made a fatal mistake.

The humans were not easy prey. They fought back with a ferocity that the aliens had not anticipated, pushing the invaders back with surprising ease. The alien overlord was furious at this setback. He had been assured of victory, and now his plans were falling apart before his very eyes.

"What do you mean they ate our ammunition?" he shouted at his subordinates. "How could they eat metal?"

The aliens had not considered the nutritional needs of the humans. They had assumed that their food would be similar to their own - maybe a little less nutrient-rich, but certainly not metal. But they had been wrong.

As it turned out, humans could eat just about anything. They had been scavenging on the aliens' dropped ammunition, chomping down on the metal and using their teeth to pry open the ammunition cases. It wasn't healthy, of course, but it was keeping them alive - and it was keeping the aliens on the defensive.

The overlord seethed with rage. He had underestimated the humans, and now he was paying the price. He ordered his troops to retreat, regroup, and come up with a new plan of attack. They could not let the humans defeat them so easily.

In the end, the aliens realized that they needed to change their tactics if they were going to survive. They could not rely on brute force alone; they needed to think creatively and find new ways to attack the human army. With a newfound respect for their opponents, they began to strategize anew.

For the humans, it was a hard-won victory. They had managed to repel the alien invaders, thanks in part to their iron stomachs. But they knew that they could not rest easy. Who knew what other tricks the aliens might have up their sleeves? They would need to be ready for anything. But for now, they could savor their triumph - and maybe even enjoy a little metallic snack as a victory treat.
