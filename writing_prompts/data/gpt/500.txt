'Go to hell!' the customer screams at you. 'I ca n't,' you say. 'Satan still has a restraining order against me.' She throws the item at you and storms off in a huff. You weren't lying, or being a smart ass. Satan really does have a restraining order out on you.
I never thought I'd say this, but Satan had saved me one time too many. At the end of the day, I don't know which one's worse – facing the wrath of an irate customer, or facing the wrath of Satan himself. Unfortunately, I had to deal with the former every day, and avoid the latter with all my might.

"Oh, come on!" the woman in front of me barked, her eyes flashing dangerously. "I don't want to hear your excuses. I want to speak to your manager. This is ridiculous."

I plastered a smile on my face, in vain. "Ma'am, I apologize for the inconvenience. But I'm afraid I'm the manager on duty right now."

She snorted, rolled her eyes, and crossed her arms. "Great customer service, that is. Can't even help me with, what – a basic request? A simple thing?" She pointed to her cart, which was filled to the brim with home décor items. "I want this pillow. It's on the shelf. Why can't I just take it and pay for it?"

I bit my lip. She was right, in a way. I should have been able to accommodate her request easily. But the thing was, that particular pillow had been recalled last week. There was a manufacturing defect, something concerning the stuffing, and it had been deemed unsafe for customers to purchase. If I let her take it off the shelf and pay for it, not only would I be risking her safety, I'd be risking the safety of every other customer in the store.

"I understand that it seems strange, ma'am," I said, in what I hoped was a conciliatory tone. "But it's actually a safety issue. That pillow was recalled by the manufacturer."

She glared at me. "I don't care. I want it."

I shook my head. "I'm sorry, ma'am. I can't sell it to you."

And that's when she lost it.

"Go to hell!" she screamed, and grabbed the pillow off the shelf. She threw it at me with all her might, and stormed out of the store in a huff.

I dodged the flying pillow, barely. It crashed against the far wall, and exploded in a puff of stuffing. I sighed, and began picking up the debris. This was not how I'd envisioned my day going.

I was about to head to the back room when my coworker, Julie, poked her head around the corner. "Hey, you okay?"

I shrugged. "Same old, same old. Angry customers, the usual."

She winced sympathetically. "Yeah, that's rough. Hey, have you heard anything from Satan lately?"

My heart skipped a beat. "No, why?"

She rolled her eyes. "You're kidding, right? His restraining order?"

I swallowed hard. She was right. Satan had taken out a restraining order on me, about six months ago. I'd only heard the details from a coworker. Apparently, Satan had come into the store one day, and had a run-in with me over some minor issue. And ever since then, he'd been making life difficult for me. He would show up at the store at random times, and would make a scene. He'd demand to speak to me, and would threaten me with all sorts of horrible things. It got to the point where my boss had to intervene, and had called the police. And lo and behold, Satan was served with a restraining order.

I shuddered at the memory. "No, I haven't heard from him. Why?"

Julie leaned in, whispering conspiratorially. "Well, I heard he was back in town. And he was asking about you."

I felt my knees go weak. "What? That's not possible. He can't come here, he has a restraining order."

She shrugged. "All I heard was that he was asking about you. That's all I know." She looked around, checking to make sure nobody was listening in. "Hey, listen. Maybe it's for the best. If he comes here, and makes a scene, we can call the cops again. Maybe this time, he'll finally get the message."

I nodded, grateful for her optimism. But deep down, I knew it wouldn't be enough. I had seen the look in Satan's eyes, the last time he'd been here. He had looked at me like I was a piece of meat, something to be devoured. And I knew that if he got the chance, he would try to hurt me.

The rest of the day passed in a blur. I dealt with the usual stream of customers, trying to put Satan out of my mind. But every little noise made me jump, and every time the front door opened, my heart raced.

By the time my shift was over, I was exhausted. I breathed a sigh of relief as I walked out of the store, into the parking lot. But my relief was short-lived.

A dark figure stepped out from behind a car, and I froze in my tracks. It was Satan.

He grinned wickedly, his eyes glittering in the dim light. "Hello there, little lamb."

I felt my knees go weak. "Satan, what – what are you doing here? You can't be here, you have a restraining order."

He chuckled, darkly. "Oh, I know all about the restraining order. But you know what they say – rules were made to be broken."

I took a step back, edging towards my car. "Please, Satan. Please leave me alone. I haven't done anything to you."

He raised his hand, and I saw something glinting in it. "That's where you're wrong, sweetheart. You have done something to me. You've hurt me, you've humiliated me. And I can't let that go."

I realized with a sickening jolt that he was holding a knife. A long, gleaming, wickedly sharp knife.

And then he lunged.

I screamed, and ran towards my car. I fumbled with the keys, and finally managed to unlock the door. I flung myself inside, and slammed the door shut.

But Satan was already there. He was pounding on the window, his face contorted with rage. "Let me in, you little brat! I'll show you what happens when you cross me."

I was shaking with terror. "Please, Satan. Please go away. I – I can't take this anymore."

He stopped pounding on the window, and looked at me. His expression softened, just a fraction. "You know what, kid? You're right. I've been too hard on you. It's not your fault. It's mine. I let my anger get the best of me. I'm sorry."

I didn't trust him. Not for a single second. But his words had caught me off guard, and I found myself relaxing just a bit.

And that's when he made his move.

He reached through the window, and grabbed my shoulder. I screamed, and tried to pull away, but he was too strong. He yanked me towards him, the knife still clutched menacingly in his other hand.

"Please," I whimpered, tears streaming down my face. "Please let me go."

He grinned, baring his teeth. "I will, eventually. But first –"

And that's when a bright light shone out from behind him. A blinding, radiant light, accompanied by a deafening roar.

Satan yelled in pain, and let go of me. He stumbled backwards, clutching his eyes. And when he looked up again, he was blinded.

I scrambled out of the car, and ran towards the light. And then, I saw who was standing in it.

It was an angel.

She was beautiful, with long, flowing hair and a serene expression. She held a flaming sword in her hand, and her wings were spread wide.

"Stay back, child," she said, her voice commanding. "I'll take care of him."

And then, she stepped forward, and plunged the sword into Satan.

He screamed, a blood-curdling sound that chilled me to the bone. And then he was gone, vanishing into a puff of smoke.

The angel turned to me, her expression still serene. "You are safe now, child. Do not fear. You are under our protection."

I sank to the ground, my body shaking. "Thank you," I whispered. "Thank you so much."

She smiled, and touched my forehead gently. "Rest now, child. You will be okay."

And then she was gone, the light fading away, leaving me alone in the dark. But I felt a sense of peace settling over me, a sense of safety that I had never felt before.

Maybe Satan had saved me one time too many. But in the end, it was the angels who had come to my rescue. And that was all that mattered.
