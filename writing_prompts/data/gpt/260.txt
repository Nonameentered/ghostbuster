Faster than Light travel has existed for centuries, this has spawned many folk laws, tall tales and down right horror stories about things that happen while in FTL.
For centuries, Faster than Light (FTL) travel had been a reality for humans. The journey would take them across galaxies in the blink of an eye, a feat that was once thought impossible. It had also spawned many tall tales, myths, and horror stories about things that happened while in FTL.

Captain Salim had heard his fair share of such stories, but he never let it affect his work. He was the captain of the starship Prometheus, one of the fastest ships in the galaxy. He had been travelling through space for almost a decade now and had never encountered any such event that could be attributed to the legends of FTL. But some of his crewmembers would share their experiences with him during their downtime, stories ranging from the banal to the terrifying.

One such tale that stuck with him was that of the “space fog.” The story went that a ship had once entered FTL, and everything had been going smoothly until the ship started to move through a thick, white haze that filled the vicinity. The crewmembers watched in horror as their instruments failed, and the ship started to falter. The story says that the ones who survived the ordeal returned to Earth with a tale of a mysterious “space fog” that had enveloped their ship and almost destroyed it.

Captain Salim dismissed such stories as mere superstition. FTL was a complex process, and there were bound to be malfunctions every once in a while. But something had happened recently that had put a minor crack in his skepticism about these stories.

It had been a routine mission, and the crew was on its way to a distant planet. They had entered the FTL, and everything had been fine until they hit a snag. The ship was shaking, and all the alarms were blaring. The comm lines were dead, and nothing could be heard or said over the loud rattling and shaking of the ship.

The crew tried everything they could to save the ship, but they couldn’t do anything. They were helpless as they watched the ship being ripped apart. That was the last they remembered about the incident, the next thing they knew the ship was back in “real space” near Earth.

The crew was in shock after the incident, but the ship's computers indicated no such event had taken place. The logs showed they had completed the mission successfully and returned to Earth without any hiccups.

Captain Salim was tasked with the investigation, but he could find no evidence of anything going wrong. There was no hidden sabotage, no mechanical failures, no environmental causes - there was just nothing. It was as if the incident had never happened.

But the silence was unnerving, like a still before a storm. The crew was worried, and they could not shake the feeling that something was off. They couldn’t explain what had happened and why they had no memory of it.

Captain Salim contacted his superiors, narrated the incident, and asked if any other such incidents had happened before. To his surprise, his superiors admitted that similar events had taken place before, but they didn’t know what caused them.

As far as they could tell, the incidents occurred randomly, with no apparent pattern or specific trigger. The only thing that they had in common was the fact that they all took place while the ships were in FTL.

Captain Salim was shocked beyond words. It seemed that there was some sort of unknown phenomenon that was causing these incidents. It was scary because if something could affect a ship in FTL, then it could be affecting other things as well.

He started to dig deeper into the subject and found more tales of things happening while in FTL. Stories of ships that encountered some sort of space anomaly that left them stranded. Tales of ships disappearing without a trace.

The more he dug, the more stories he found, and the more paranoid he became. He was starting to see a pattern, and it was not good. He found more and more evidence to support the original tales of danger while in FTL.

One of the most intriguing stories he stumbled upon talked about a ship that had gone through a sudden, dramatic, and unpredictable jump. According to the tale, the crew of this ship had lost all sense of time. They had no idea how long they had been in FTL or how far they had travelled. When the ship finally emerged from FTL, the crew discovered that they were thousands of years in the future.

It all made sense now. FTL was like a door that opened to a different dimension where time and space acted differently. The more the ship travelled, the greater the chance that it would encounter anomalies that it could not explain or understand, and that it was these anomalies that caused the tales of FTL lore.

Captain Salim knew that he had to report his findings to his superiors. They had to know that the technology they were dealing with was not just about speed and convenience. It was also about the unknown, the unpredictable, the dangers lurking in the vastness of space.

He also knew that humanity had to keep discovering new systems and technologies to guarantee a safe FTL travel. Until then, they had to live with the stories and legends of the hidden dangers of Faster than Light travel.
