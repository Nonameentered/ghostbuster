Alone one day in your living room your SO falls asleep. S/he never awakes, everyone you then encounter falls asleep shortly and never wakes.
It all started one lazy Sunday afternoon. My boyfriend and I were lounging on the couch, watching TV. He had just finished a busy week at work, so we decided to take a day off and just relax. That's when he suddenly dozed off. I didn't think much of it at first. I just continued watching TV, thinking he'd wake up in a few minutes.

But he didn't.

I tried to wake him up, but he wouldn't budge. I panicked and called 911. They arrived within minutes, but no matter what they tried, they couldn't revive him. It was as if he had fallen into a deep coma.

That's when things started getting strange. As soon as the EMTs left, I tried calling my family and friends, but no one picked up. I went outside and saw that the streets were eerily quiet. No one was around. It was as if the whole world had fallen asleep.

Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. I was alone, forced to survive on my own. I had to scavenge for food and supplies, defenses against those who had fallen asleep. I eventually found a few others, but they were all in the same state as my boyfriend.

I yearned for human connection, but it seemed impossible in this world of perpetual sleep. Every time I'd come across someone awake, they'd eventually nod off and never wake up again. I was scared that I too would succumb to this strange illness.

One night, I sat alone in my living room, wondering if I was the only person left alive. And that's when I saw it. A figure in the distance, walking towards me. I ran towards them, tears streaming down my face. And as we embraced, I knew that I wasn't completely alone in this world after all.
