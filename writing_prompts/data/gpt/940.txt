A Freshman in high school finds out he has the ability to control people's minds and ideas.
Michael had just started his freshman year of high school when he realized something strange about himself. It was a Thursday afternoon, and he was sitting in math class when he noticed his seatmate, Sarah, struggling to understand a problem on the board. Without thinking, Michael reached out and touched her arm. Suddenly, Sarah's eyes lit up and she blurted out the answer.

Michael was stunned. He had never been able to do anything like that before. The more he thought about it, the more he realized that he had always had a strange power over people. When he talked to them, they seemed to listen a little too closely. When he made a suggestion, people often followed it without much resistance. It was like he had a direct line to their thoughts.

Michael was equal parts excited and terrified. He knew that mind control was something out of a sci-fi movie, not real life. But there was no denying what had just happened with Sarah.

For the first few weeks, Michael kept his power to himself. He experimented with it in small ways, testing the limits of what he could do. He made a classmate forget their lunch once, and another classmate suddenly started wearing their hair differently after a conversation with Michael.

But as Michael got more comfortable with his power, he started using it in bigger and bigger ways. He convinced his friends to ditch school, and they spent the day exploring the city. He got a group of kids to sneak into a nearby amusement park after hours. He even convinced a teacher to give him an A on a paper he had barely started.

Michael knew he had to be careful with his power, but he couldn't resist the thrill of controlling people's thoughts and actions. He was addicted to the rush of power, and he couldn't imagine ever giving it up. But as he looked around at the people under his influence, he understood for the first time the true cost of his abilities.
