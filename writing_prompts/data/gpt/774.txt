My greatest fear has always been being alone in the dark. The thought of being completely isolated and unable to see anything around me sends shivers down my spine. But my absolute worst nightmare goes beyond just being alone and in the dark.

In my nightmare, I am not only stuck in a pitch-black room, but I am also unable to move. My limbs are paralyzed, and I am completely helpless. I can hear footsteps approaching me from behind, but I cannot turn my head to see who it is. I begin to panic as the footsteps get closer and closer until I am standing directly in front of whatever is making them. 

Suddenly, a bright light is switched on, blinding me. I shield my eyes as I hear the sound of laughter and multiple voices around me. They are taunting me, mocking me for being unable to move or see. I try to scream for help, but no sound comes out.

As quickly as the light was switched on, it is switched off again, leaving me back in complete darkness. The footsteps begin to recede, and I am left alone again, still unable to move or see. I am trapped in this nightmare, unable to wake up or escape.

My heart is racing as I imagine this scenario, and I am grateful it is just a nightmare. But the fear remains, and I know that I will always be scared of being alone in the dark.
