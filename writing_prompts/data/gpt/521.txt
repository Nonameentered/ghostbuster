Take something ordinary and make it extraordinary.
Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She had a pink pencil that she carried with her everywhere she went. The pencil was nothing special, just a cheap one that she had gotten from the dollar store. But to Lily, it was her most cherished possession.

One day, Lily was in art class and she had no inspiration for what to draw. She started to doodle with her pink pencil, not even really paying attention to what she was doing. Suddenly, she noticed that the pencil was glowing! At first, she thought she was imagining things, but then she realized that the pink lead was glowing a beautiful shade of pink.

She quickly started to draw with her pencil, and as she did, the lines started to come to life. The flowers she drew bloomed right before her eyes and the butterflies she drew flew off the page. Lily was astonished and thrilled at the same time.

Word quickly spread around the school about the miraculous pink pencil. Artists from all over came to see the pencil in action and wanted to borrow it for their own drawings. Lily became a local celebrity, all because of her ordinary pink pencil that had become something extraordinary. From that day on, Lily never underestimated the power of something ordinary.
