Your closest friend, for reasons unknown, tries to kill you. You're still alive because you pretended to be dead. Your friend has disposed of your 'body' in the woods, and now you must find out why he attempted to kill you.
It was supposed to be a fun camping trip between two closest friends, Paul and Ryan. But something was off about Ryan from the moment they arrived at the campsite. He was jittery, constantly checking his phone, and hardly speaking to Paul. Paul brushed it off as fatigue from the long drive.

As darkness fell, they settled down in their tent. Suddenly, Paul felt Ryan's hand close around his throat, choking him. He couldn't breathe and his vision started to fade. As his consciousness ebbed away, he saw Ryan's crazed eyes and realized that his best friend was trying to kill him.

Paul knew that he had to play dead if he wanted to survive. Ryan was stronger, and any resistance would only make things worse. So, he went limp and pretended to have passed out. Ryan loosened his grip, thinking that his friend was gone for good.

With Ryan thinking he had succeeded, he took Paul's 'body' and buried it deep in the woods. Paul, however, was still conscious and forced himself to dig his way out of the makeshift grave. He was bruised and battered, but alive.

He needed to find out what had gone wrong between him and Ryan. They had been friends since childhood, and this sudden attack made no sense. Paul stumbled through the dense woods, trying to find a way back to civilization.

Eventually, he made it back to town and called the police. He told them everything that had happened but was careful not to reveal that he was still alive. They found Ryan, who was standing near the campsite looking distraught. He broke down under questioning and admitted to trying to kill Paul.

It turned out that Ryan had been deep in gambling debt and was desperate for money. He saw killing Paul as his only option to get out of debt. Paul was shocked and saddened that his friend could do this to him but was grateful to be alive.

The incident made Paul value life and friendship even more. He realized that sometimes, people do things that they never thought they were capable of, and that he had to be careful whom he trusted. He would never be able to trust Ryan again, but at least he had escaped with his life.
