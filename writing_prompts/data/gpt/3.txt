For years in your youth the same imaginary character appears in your dreams, you are good friends. Years later, when adult, you meet her in real life, she clearly recognises you and tries to avoid you, and you want answers.
Ever since I was a child, I had this recurring dream - a dream where I was friends with an imaginary character. She was a girl about my age, with long, curly hair, and big, deep brown eyes. She was always smiling in my dreams and we spent hours playing games and telling each other stories. It was a world that existed only in my mind, but it felt so real that even today, I can recall every detail of those dreams.

As I grew older, those dreams became fewer, and eventually, they stopped altogether. But I always wondered who that girl was. Was she just a figment of my imagination, or was she real? I had no way of knowing.

Years later, I found myself in a crowded coffee shop in the heart of the city. It was the same coffee shop where I often came to get some work done, but this time, something was different. A girl caught my eye - it was her, the girl from my dreams. She was sitting just a few tables away, sipping on her coffee and scrolling through her phone. I couldn't believe it - was she real? Was I dreaming again?

I went up to her, trying not to sound too crazy, and asked if we had met before. For a moment, she looked startled, and then she composed herself and said, "I don't think so."

But I knew it was her. I recognized the same curly hair and deep brown eyes that I had seen so many times in my dreams. "I think we have," I persisted, "in my dreams!"

She looked at me incredulously, then nodded her head slightly. "Is that so?" she muttered, then stood up to leave.

"Wait!" I called out, grabbing her by the wrist. "How can you just leave like this? We need to talk!"

She pulled her wrist free. "There's nothing to talk about. Those were just dreams, and dreams are not reality."

"But you remember them too, don't you?" I asked.

She hesitated for a moment, then said, "I don't know what you're talking about. I have to go now."

With that, she rushed out of the coffee shop, leaving me standing there, confused and frustrated. Who was she? Why was she so afraid to talk to me?

I decided to investigate and started asking around, trying to find out who she was. It took me a while, but finally, I found her. Her name was Audrey, and she lived just a few blocks away from me.

I couldn't resist the temptation to meet her again, so I went to her house, hoping to get some answers. When she saw me, she tried to slam the door, but I was quicker, and I pushed my way in.

"What do you want from me?" she screamed. "Why can't you just leave me alone?"

"Because I need to know the truth!" I yelled back. "Who are you, and why did you appear in my dreams for so many years?"

She looked at me, and I could see the fear in her eyes. "I can't explain it," she whispered. "It's just something that happens sometimes. Accept it and move on."

But I couldn't move on. I needed to know why Audrey, this girl from my dreams, was so important to me. I caught her by the wrist again, and this time she didn't resist. We sat down, and she began to tell me everything.

Audrey was not just a girl from my dreams - she was a real person. She had been born on the same day as me, in the same hospital, to parents who had become close friends with my parents. As children, we had played together often, until one day, she moved away unexpectedly.

But in my mind, she never left. She had become an imaginary friend to me, a symbol of everything that was pure and innocent in my life. And when I needed her the most, she had reappeared in my dreams, to keep me company and make me feel less lonely.

As Audrey finished telling me her story, I felt something inside me shift. I suddenly realized that my dreams had been more than just fantasies - they had been a reminder of something real and wonderful that I had lost. And with that realization came a sense of peace, as if I had finally found the missing piece of my soul.
