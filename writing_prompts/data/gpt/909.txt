You're in high school. The teacher excuses them self and leaves. They don't come back. You realize all the adults have vanished. The school is filled with students with no guidance. Every door is locked from the outside.
It was a typical Monday morning at Franklin High School. Students rushed into their classrooms, eager to start the day and learn something new. I sat in the back row of my English class, scanning the room for any familiar faces. As the bell rang, our teacher, Mrs. Thompson, walked in and began her lesson.

About an hour into class, Mrs. Thompson suddenly excused herself and left the room. We waited for a few minutes, assuming she would return, but she never did. We started to joke around, thinking she had eaten something bad at breakfast and had to run to the bathroom. But as the minutes turned into hours, our concern grew.

Eventually, a few students got up to go to the bathroom and explore the hallway. When they came back, they reported that all the doors were locked. Every single one. We tried to call for help, but all cell phone signals were jammed for some reason. Panic began to set in as we realized we were stuck inside the school.

A few hours later, we started to notice something strange. The entire staff was gone. We searched every floor, every room, and every closet, but there was no sign of any adults at all. The realization hit us hard. There was no one to guide us, help us, or lead us out of the building.

The day dragged on, and the students became restless. Some tried to break the doors open with desks and chairs, but they were built like Fort Knox. Others tried to find any hints or clues that could explain what was going on.

As nightfall drew near, we were all huddled in the cafeteria, trying to stay calm and hope for a solution. That’s when we first heard it. A soft knocking on the door, followed by a low whisper. Someone was trying to get in. We quickly realized that it was through the window in the door. The whispers grew louder until we could make out what was being said.

“Don’t let them find you. If you’re on your own, you might have a chance.”

We looked at each other in confusion and fear. Who was trying to warn us? What did they mean? We were about to find out.

The cafeteria doors burst open, revealing masked men in black uniforms, wielding long batons. They stormed in, shouting orders at us and threatening violence if we didn’t cooperate. We were forced to form a line and march out of the school into a waiting truck. Frantic questions ricocheted through our minds. Where were we going? Who were these people?

When we arrived at our destination, we were pushed into a dark room, illuminated only by dim lights overhead. The masked men began to issue orders, claiming they had taken over the country and we were all to obey them. Anyone who refused was met with brutality.

Over time, as days turned into weeks, our morale sunk lower and lower as a feeling of hopelessness settled upon us. I missed my family, my friends, my life before all of this. I hoped someone would come and save us, but it felt like that was less and less likely each day. 

That was when I realized that it was up to us to save ourselves: the students who were left behind, abandoned, and forgotten. We were the only ones left. We had to stick together, help each other, and keep hope alive, no matter how hard it was. 

Right then, as we were surrounded by darkness, I vowed that I would lead us to safety, no matter how difficult the journey would be. Because we were stronger together than we were alone, and we would never give up hope.
