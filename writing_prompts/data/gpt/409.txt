For as long as she could remember, Davina had grown up knowing that her family was different. Her father was a werewolf, and on the nights of the full moon, he would chain her up in the basement to keep her from causing any harm to herself or others.

Davina never liked being chained up, but she understood why her father did it. Every full moon, she would feel a tug deep within her, a primal urge to run free and let loose the beast within.

One night, as the full moon rose high in the sky, Davina found herself writhing in agony, her bones expanding and her muscles stretching beyond human limits. She howled in pain and fear, begging for release.

It was then that a neighbor heard her screams and called child protective services. When the authorities arrived, they found Davina alone in the basement, chained up and barely conscious.

She was immediately taken to the hospital, where doctors treated her injuries and ran tests on her blood. It was then that they discovered the truth about her condition, that she was a werewolf just like her father.

The news sent shockwaves throughout the community, with some people calling for Davina to be locked up or even killed to prevent her from causing harm. But there were others who wanted to help her, to show her the love and acceptance that she had been denied for so long.

As her story spread, people from all over the world sent gifts and cards, offering their support and helping to fund her medical bills. The outpouring of love and compassion was overwhelming, and in time, it helped to heal Davina's wounds both physical and emotional.

But even with all the love and support she received, Davina couldn't help feeling a deep sense of guilt for what she had become. She knew that she was a danger to herself and others, and that the only way to keep herself and those around her safe was to continue being chained up on full moon nights.

It wasn't the life she wanted, but it was the only life she knew. And in the end, it was a small price to pay for the love and acceptance that had finally come her way.
