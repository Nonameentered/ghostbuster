Killing Hitler has become a sport amongst time travelers. Points are awarded for creativity and difficulty. You are last year's champion, how did you win?
I sat alone in my dingy hotel room, staring at the wall in front of me. The news had just broken: the time-traveling community had declared killing Hitler their newest sport.

I was last year’s champion. My mind swirled with thoughts of how I had won. I had to come up with something even better this year. The problem was, how do you top killing the most evil man in history?

I’d always been reluctant to participate in the game. There was something unsettling about making a sport of the death of millions of innocent people. But the reward for victory was too great to ignore - an all-expenses-paid trip to anywhere in the world. And, of course, the bragging rights that came from being the reigning champion.

After hours of brainstorming, I had an idea. Instead of killing Hitler, I would save him. It was a risky move – going against the rules of the game – but it was creative, and definitely scored high in difficulty.

I prepared for weeks, studying the historical timeline in detail, and researching Hitler's behaviors and personality. 

On the day of the event, I arrived in Berlin in 1939, the year Hitler declared war on Poland. I donned a Nazi uniform and waited in a corner, watching the crowds eagerly. As I scoped out the area, I noticed two time travelers lurking in the shadows, looking exceptionally shady. They were my competitors, I did not know their plan but I was sure that they would try to kill Hitler. 

As Hitler walked by me, surrounded by his guards, I pretended to faint and fell to the ground. His guards immediately rushed to help me while the two time travelers moved closer with their weapons in hand.

I knew I had to act fast before they could take the shot. I jumped up on my feet and pushed Hitler out of the way, taking a bullet to the chest. The guards were quick to subdue my attackers, disqualifying them from the game. 

As I lay on the ground, the guards approached me, ready to finish me off. But before they could, Hitler intervened. 

"Stop!” he shouted. "This man saved my life! He is a true hero!"

As Hitler helped me to my feet, I could hardly believe what had just happened. The entire course of history had changed – no longer would Hitler be seen as only evil incarnate. 

The two other time travelers were kicked out of the game and would never be allowed again. I was declared a winner for the creativity and exceptional difficulty of the feat. I took my prize and spent it on a trip to see the beautiful clouds of Jupiter. 

But it was a bitter victory. I’d saved a man who had caused such destruction in the world. I knew that the present-day world was a better place because of what I’d done, but the memories of the atrocities that had occurred would never be erased.

The time-traveling community might have made killing Hitler into a sport, but I’d changed the game forever.
