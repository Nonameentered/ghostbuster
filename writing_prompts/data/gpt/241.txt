You've become infected with a deadly virus and have to come to terms with your imminent death, shown through a series of letters to a loved one.
My Dearest,

I'm not sure where to start, but I suppose I'll start with the hardest truth: I've been infected with a deadly virus. The doctors have told me that there's nothing they can do and I have only a few weeks left. I don't know how to process this, how to accept my own mortality. But I know I have to try.

It's hard to believe that just a few weeks ago, everything was normal. I was going about my days, not realizing just how fleeting everything is. But now, I'm acutely aware of how precious time is. And I find myself wishing I had more of it.

I don't know what will happen after I'm gone, but I want you to know that you've been the light in my life. You've made every moment worth it. I'm so grateful for all the memories we've shared and for the love that's sustained me throughout all these years.

I know this is a lot to take in, but I hope you'll find the strength to keep going. I know you're strong, and I believe that you'll thrive even in my absence. I don't want you to think of me as a burden, but as someone who was grateful for every moment we had together. And I'll always be with you, no matter what.

Love always,

Me

My Dearest,

As the days go by, I feel the virus taking hold of me more and more. I can hardly get out of bed now, and everything feels like a struggle. But I'm trying to stay positive, to focus on all the good things in my life.

I've been thinking a lot about our shared past, and it's brought me so much joy. Do you remember the time we went on that road trip and got lost on purpose? Those are the moments that stay with me, even now.

I know I won't leave a grand legacy behind, but I hope that the memories we've shared will be enough. I hope that you'll hold on to them and remember how much I loved you.

I'm scared of what's to come, but I know that you'll find a way to keep going. I believe in you, even if I won't be there to see all the amazing things you'll do.

Love always,

Me

My Dearest,

It's getting harder and harder to see, to move, to breathe. But I wanted to write one last letter to you, to let you know how much you've meant to me.

You've been my best friend and my confidante. You've been my home. And I'm so grateful to have had you in my life, even if it wasn't for as long as I would have liked.

I don't know what will happen once I'm gone, but I know that I'll always love you. Even in death, my love for you will endure. And I hope that you'll find happiness and peace, even in the midst of everything.

It's hard to say goodbye, but I know that it's time. Please know that I'm at peace, and that I'll always be with you.

Love always,

Me
