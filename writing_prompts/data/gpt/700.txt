As I sat down to have my dinner at this quaint little restaurant, I couldn't help but stare at my waiter. There was something about him that made me feel uncomfortable. Was it his strikingly similar mustache? Or maybe the way he spoke with a heavy German accent? Whatever it was, I couldn't shake the feeling that he was Adolf Hitler himself.

But as the night wore on, my fears slowly dissipated. He was too kind, too gentle, too compassionate to be the man responsible for countless deaths and atrocities. He listened intently as I spoke about my day, and even offered some advice.

In fact, I found myself enjoying his company so much that I asked him if he would like to grab a drink with me after his shift. As we parted ways, I couldn't help but feel grateful that my initial suspicions were nothing more than just that - suspicions. Hitler was long gone, and my new friend was just a kind-hearted waiter trying to make a living.
