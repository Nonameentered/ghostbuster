You have a very mundane talent, so mundane that you've never shown it to anyone. The first time you do, as a party trick, you're told that your talent is physically impossible.
I’ve always known that I had a peculiar talent. It’s just that it’s so mundane that I’ve never really thought much of it before. I mean, it’s not like juggling or magic tricks or anything like that. It’s just - well, it’s hard to describe.

Anyway, I was at a friend’s party the other night, and we were all taking turns showing off our party tricks. One guy was doing card tricks, another girl was singing, and so on. When it was my turn, I tried to back out, saying that my talent was too boring, but everyone insisted that they wanted to see it.

So I took a deep breath and did it. I closed my eyes and focused all my energy on the tip of my right index finger. I concentrated hard, and then - out of nowhere - a tiny spark shot out from my fingertip and landed on the table with a tiny hiss.

Everyone was silent for a second, and then they all started talking at once. Someone said it was a trick lighter, someone else suggested it was a firecracker. I tried to explain that I didn’t know what it was, but they didn’t seem to believe me.

One guy - a physics major, no less - pulled out his phone and started googling. He said that it was impossible for a human to generate a spark of that size without some kind of external ignition or flame.

I felt like a freak. My simple little talent was suddenly something alien and terrifying. People started backing away from me, like I was dangerous or contagious. I didn’t know what to do.

Eventually, the party ended and everyone went home. I stayed behind and helped my friend clean up, feeling like a freak and a failure. But then I remembered something that I’d read once in a book about paranormal abilities.

It said that many people who have talents like mine are misunderstood and feared by those who don’t understand them. That the best thing to do was to embrace your talent and use it to help others.

So that’s what I’ve been doing. I’ve been practicing my spark-making and figuring out how to control it. I’ve started doing demonstrations at science fairs and community events, showing kids how to generate static electricity and talking about the wonders of electricity and energy. It’s not a big deal, but it makes people smile. And that’s enough for me.
