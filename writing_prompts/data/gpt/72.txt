When I was younger, I was always told that killing was wrong. It was an act that took away a life, and it was something that could never truly be undone. So when I first discovered that killing could grant me certain attributes of the one I killed, I didn't tell anyone about it. How could I? They would never understand. Instead, I kept it hidden, exploring the world in my own way, and learning about animals and creatures I had never heard of before.

At first, it was just small animals like rabbits and squirrels. Their speed and agility were something that I had never experienced before, and it was exhilarating to be able to run through the forest and jump from tree to tree with ease. I felt like I was invincible, and nothing could stop me. But as I grew older, my taste for killing grew larger, and soon, I was taking on creatures that were much stronger and more dangerous.

It started with wolves. The first time I took one out, I was terrified. I didn't know what to expect, and I didn't know if I would be able to take it down. But when I did, I felt a surge of power that I had never felt before. Suddenly, my senses were heightened, and I was able to smell things from miles away. My strength had also increased, and I was able to lift things that I had struggled with before. I felt like a superhero.

Over time, my victims grew larger and more powerful. I took down a bear once, and I gained its incredible strength. I could lift anything, and I was never tired. The downside was that I had a constant hunger, and I felt like I was never full. But I was willing to deal with that to be able to have that kind of power at my fingertips.

Eventually, I reached a point where I wasn't satisfied with just animals. I wanted something more. Something that would give me even greater power than I already had. That was when I first heard of the Wendigo.

The Wendigo was a creature of legend, said to be responsible for many mysterious disappearances in the forest. It was supposed to be incredibly powerful, with the ability to control the minds of those around it. It was also said to be almost impossible to kill. But I was determined.

Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months as I hunted the Wendigo relentlessly. It seemed to know that I was after it, and it avoided me at all costs. It was aggravating, but I refused to give up. Finally, one day I caught a glimpse of it through the trees. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest as I crept closer, an arrow nocked in my bow.

When I finally made the kill, I felt like I was on top of the world. I had never felt such power before. I could feel myself growing larger and stronger, my senses heightened to the point where I could smell things for miles away. But there was something else, too. Something darker. Something that I couldn't put my finger on.

Over the next few days, I noticed a change in myself. I was hungrier than ever before, and I felt like I was losing my grip on reality. The voices in my head were growing louder, and I was having trouble distinguishing what was real and what wasn't. I started seeing things that weren't really there, and I couldn't control my actions. It was like the Wendigo was still controlling me, even though it was dead.

It wasn't long before I knew I had to stop. I didn't want to hurt anyone else, but I couldn't control myself anymore. So I retreated into the forest, where I knew no one else would find me. And that's where I've been ever since. I try not to think about what I've done, or what I've become, but it's always there at the back of my mind.

Killing has turned me into a monster. It's made me into something that I never wanted to be. And now, I'm stuck here, alone in the forest, never to see the outside world again. But at least I know that no one else will suffer because of me.
