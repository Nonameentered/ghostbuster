The room was filled with buzzing microphones and cameras. The big shot journalist, Rachel Collins, was ready to interview the one person who had lived through it all – an immortal. She had been given this opportunity to pick the mind of someone who had witnessed the birth and death of civilizations.

The immortal, a 3000-year-old man named Alexander, walked into the room with a grand aura. He took his seat and smiled, his piercing blue eyes making contact with the journalist.

“Welcome Alexander,” Rachel said, already sensing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to understand history in its truest form. “You have seen so much throughout your life, so much to tell the world. Tell us, what do you recall of the ancient world?”

“I’m afraid I don’t remember much of it,” Alexander said, scratching his head.

Rachel looked confused. “What do you mean, Mr. Alexander? You were there when civilizations rose and fell!”

“I was… but it’s been so long that it’s all a haze now. It’s like trying to remember a dream you had ages ago. It’s not as clear as I would like it to be.”

Rachel hesitated before continuing. “What about the Renaissance period? Surely, that must be more memorable for you?”

“Not really. I remember some details…. But some things slip easily through even the most powerful memory.”

Rachel looked perplexed, but she didn’t give up. “What was it like during the Industrial era, when the world was revolutionizing?”

Alexander smiled, “Ah, yes! The Industrial age was one of a kind! However… It’s all so blurry now, you see.”

Rachel couldn’t believe what Alexander was saying. How could someone who had lived for 3000 years not remember much of history? She composed herself and asked, “If you don’t remember these events, then what do you have to offer us?”

“I can give you my observations of how these events impacted the world. I may not recall who ruled Italy during the 16th century, but I can tell you what effect it had on the common people.”

As the interview progressed, Rachel and the viewers around the world realized that immortality didn't give perfect memory. Alexander was only able to recall fragments of history, sometimes even getting details mixed up. 

Rachel was disappointed that she couldn’t get all the answers she’d hoped for. However, something about Alexander’s words struck an inner chord within her. 

It was a reminder of how important it is to focus less on the details and more on the big picture. The grand sweep of history that Alexander had observed over millennia. It gave a better understanding of the impact historic events had on shaping society through time. How wars were fought and peace was achieved, how societies evolved and revolutions transformed the course of humanity – what it meant to be human through the lens of history.

Alexander had given the world something more than just his specific historical recollection. He had given a unique perspective on human nature, the evolution of societies, and the growth of civilization. Something of great value that far exceeded the precise dates of events.

As the interview came to a close, Rachel realized that immortality may be a curse, giving you more time to live but it doesn’t guarantee you perfect memory. But that didn’t diminish the value of the insights of an immortal who had observed humanity’s story from beginning to end.
