You are a dream broker. The dreams are bought, cultivated, and resold. The pride of your work, the golden dream, has rotted into a nightmare. A guest asks to buy the nightmare.
Once upon a time, in a world far away from ours, there was a dream broker named Arin. His job was to buy dreams from regular folks, cultivate them, and resell them to high-paying clients. He prided himself on his work, and he had made a name for himself in his line of work.

Arin had been in the business of dream brokering for several years now, and he had earned a lot of money through his golden dreams, which were the most popular with his clients. His golden dreams were the ones that promised success, wealth, and happiness, and they never failed to bring him the most profit.

But one day, something terrible happened. One of his golden dreams had rotted into a nightmare. The dream had been sold to a billionaire client who wanted to become even richer. The dream promised him that he would become the richest man in the entire world, but what the client did not know was that his greed would eventually destroy him.

The dream transformed into a nightmare, and the billionaire began to lose everything he had worked so hard for. His health declined, his family left him, and he was left with nothing but his wealth, which he could no longer enjoy.

Arin was devastated. He had never experienced a dream rotting into a nightmare before. He had always been careful in choosing his dreams, and he had never encountered such a thing. He knew that he could not sell the nightmare, and he did not want anyone to experience the same fate as the billionaire client.

One day, a guest arrived at his office. The guest was different from the usual clients that Arin had dealt with. He was an old man, with a kind face and gentle eyes. He wore a cloak made of the finest silk, and his boots were polished to a shine.

"Hello, Arin," the guest said, his voice soft and soothing. "I have heard of your work, and I have come to seek your services."

Arin couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. He had never liked strangers, and he had never met anyone like this guest before.

"What do you want?" Arin asked, trying to keep his voice steady.

"I want to buy a dream from you," the guest replied.

Arin thought for a moment, wondering what kind of dream the old man could possibly want. He wondered if the old man knew about the nightmare that had devastated him.

"Well, I have many dreams to choose from," Arin said, "but why don't you tell me what kind of dream you want?"

"I want to buy the nightmare," the guest said, his eyes locking onto Arin's.

Arin was taken aback. Nobody had ever asked for a nightmare before, and he was unsure if he was willing to sell it to this strange guest.

"But the nightmare is dangerous," Arin said. "It has already caused one person to suffer. I cannot let it harm anyone else."

"I understand your concerns, Arin," the guest said. "But I am not like other people. I have lived a long life, and I have seen many things. I want to experience everything that life has to offer, even the nightmares."

Arin thought carefully about the guest's words. He realized that the old man was not like his other clients. He was not interested in wealth or success, but in experiences.

"Very well," Arin said, finally giving in. "But I must warn you, the nightmare is not like any other dream. It will be dangerous, and it may harm you."

"I understand," the guest said, a smile spreading across his face. "I am willing to take that risk."

Arin reluctantly sold the nightmare to the guest, wondering what kind of person would willingly buy a nightmare. But he watched in amazement as the old man faced the nightmare head-on, taking it in stride as though it were nothing more than a small inconvenience.

As he watched the old man experiencing the nightmare, Arin saw something he had never seen before. He saw the value in experiences over wealth and success, and he realized that his work as a dream broker was not just about making money but about giving people the chance to live their lives to the fullest.

From that day forward, Arin began to cultivate dreams that were meaningful and fulfilling, giving his clients the chance to experience life in new and exciting ways. And he had the old man to thank for opening his eyes to the true value of dreams.
