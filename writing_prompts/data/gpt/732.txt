You wake up in world full of cardboard people. These are cut-outs of your family, friends and general people. The world are populated with yourself and them.
I woke up in a strange world full of cardboard people. I looked around, and it was as if I had fallen into a diorama of my life. All the people I knew were there, but they were just flat, lifeless cut-outs.

I stepped closer to my cardboard family, trying to get a better look. My wife and kids were there, frozen in place, their mouths agape. It was eerie, like they were waiting for me to make the next move.

I knew I had to explore this new world, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. I turned around and saw a cardboard version of myself standing a few feet away. I stepped closer to the cut-out, trying to get a better look. It was me, but not quite.

I looked at the ground and saw that even my feet were flat, like they had been pressed down onto a piece of cardboard. I couldn't believe it. I was completely immersed in this world.

As I walked around, I saw more cardboard people. There were cut-outs of my friends, my acquaintances, and complete strangers. They were all frozen in place, like they were waiting for something to happen.

I tried to touch one of the cut-outs, but my hand went right through it. It was like trying to touch a mirage. The cardboard people were just that – cardboard.

As I continued to explore, I felt my chest tightening. It's as if the air was being sucked out of my lungs. The world around me was becoming more vivid; every color, every detail of the cardboard people, was becoming more defined.

I paused and looked up, and that's when I saw it. The source of the world's energy was a massive, pulsing orb of light in the sky, and it was slowly making its way towards me.

I had no idea what it meant, but I knew I had to get away. I ran as fast as I could, trying to find refuge. But everywhere I turned, there were cardboard people. I was surrounded.

I took one final look back and realized I had nowhere to run. The orb of light was now just a few feet away. I closed my eyes and braced myself for impact.

Suddenly, everything went quiet. I opened my eyes to find myself back in my bed, drenched in sweat, the sun just starting to rise.

It was all just a dream.

But as I got ready for my day, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was different. At work, I saw my coworkers in a new light – almost as if they were just cut-outs of people themselves. My wife and kids seemed different, too. It was as if the dream had seeped into my waking life.

I tried to push these feelings aside and continue on with my day, but it was impossible. The cardboard people haunted me, both in my dreams and in my reality. I couldn't escape them.

As time passed, my life became more and more surreal. Every moment felt like it was part of a larger, scripted drama. I couldn't help but wonder if everyone else in my life was just a cardboard cut-out, waiting for something – or someone – to come along and animate them.

The thought was terrifying. I felt disconnected from the world around me, like I was trapped in a never-ending nightmare.

I thought back to the pulsing orb of light that had terrified me in my dream. Maybe that was the key – maybe I needed to confront whatever that thing was to escape this surreal world.

I made my way to the place where I had first encountered the cardboard people. And there, once again, I found myself faced with the pulsing orb of light.

I stepped closer, and the orb grew brighter and more intense. I closed my eyes and focused on the feeling of my feet on the ground. And then, in a matter of seconds, the world around me shifted.

When I opened my eyes, I was back in the real world – the one I knew and loved. I could hear the sounds of the city outside my window, and feel the sun on my face.

For a moment, I sat there, breathing heavily, trying to catch my breath. And then, slowly but surely, I started to calm down. The cardboard people were gone, replaced by real, living, breathing humans.

It was a relief, a welcome escape from the dream world that had tormented me for so long. But as the days passed, I found myself wondering – what if the cardboard world was real? What if I had just slipped back into it, and the real world was the dream?

The thought was terrifying, but I knew one thing for certain – I never wanted to go back to that surreal world of cardboard people.
