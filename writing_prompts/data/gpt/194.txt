holic writes his (or her) suicide note. [WP]
As I sit down to write this, I can feel the weight of this decision bearing down on my chest. I never thought I would be here, pen in hand, trying to put my thoughts into words. But here I am.

I've always been a bit of a workaholic. I found solace in my work, in the rhythm of the tasks and the satisfaction of a job well done. But somewhere along the way, I lost myself. The work became my only purpose, my only reason for being.

It wasn't until I hit rock bottom that I realized what had happened. I had lost my family, my friends, my healthâ€”all sacrificed on the altar of my career. And for what? A few extra bucks and a fleeting feeling of success?

It's too late to turn back time, but I can at least try to make things right. By ending my life, I'm hoping to make a statement, to show the world that there is more to life than work and money. I don't want to be remembered as a statistic, another workaholic who burned out and gave up.

I want my legacy to be something different. Something that inspires people to live life to the fullest, to reconnect with the people they love and the passions that make life worth living. Maybe by ending my life, I can start a conversation that will prevent others from falling into the same trap.

So here I am, writing this note. I know it won't erase the pain I've caused or bring back what I've lost. But maybe, just maybe, it will help someone else realize that there's another way to live.
