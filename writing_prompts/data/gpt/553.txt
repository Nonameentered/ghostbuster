Peter always believed in reincarnation, so when he found himself in a small room after his death, he wasn't confused. It was plain and simple, what he had always expected. The room was white, with a single table, chair, and a mysterious device on top of it. Peter immediately approached the device - it was called the 'Life Designer.' There was a small button on it. Peter pushed it, and the screen flickered on.

Peter was confused about how to use it. He expected some lines to fill up, give him answers about who he would become in his next life. The possibilities were endless - animals, other human beings, perhaps even something he couldn't even imagine.

The Life Designer had a voice that sounded like a Siri. "Hello, please enter your information," it called out to him. Peter sort of felt like he was at one of those self-checkouts at a grocery store. Should he behave like a regular customer there or should he bask in the glory of his newfound superpowers? Peter chose the latter.

"I am Peter. I want to design myself for the next life," he pronounced confidently.

"Understood, Peter. Please state what you would like to be in the next life," came the mechanical voice of the Life Designer.

"A cat," Peter said, with an impossibly wide grin.

The device beeped and began to process. The screen flickered quickly. A few seconds later, the Life Designer announced, "Peter, you have seventy-two options of cats. Please select one."

 Peter scrolled through options presented on the screen before finally selecting a beautiful white Persian cat.

The Life Designer started generating more questions, and Peter quickly realized that there was an infinite number of possibilities. It was a long process - a mix of signing up for a social media account and a job application. His next life was going to be a dream come true.

After Peter had finished designing himself, he stepped back, wondering how long he would wait until he was reborn as a cat. Just as he had started to daydream about his future feline life, a door behind him suddenly opened. Peter looked back and realized that it was now time for him to leave this room. He stepped out and found himself in an infinite, non-linear universe with strange colors and shapes. What did this mean - was he a cat now? He wasn't sure, but he was excited to find out!
