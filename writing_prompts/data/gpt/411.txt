The alien invasion of Earth has begun and the fearsome yet humanoid creatures came from the skys in massive bloodred ships. For unexplainable reasons, they still use sabers and ride on horseback. You find yourself being charged at by Calvary. .. in the 22nd century.
The world had always been a constant battleground, nations at war with each other, seeking to gain more power and prestige. But no one could have ever predicted the arrival of aliens that would bring the entire world to its knees.

It started with rumors of strange sightings in the skies, several months before the actual attack took place. People speculated about the strange objects, UFOs and alien spacecrafts, but no one really thought it could happen, not at this day and age.

However, the rumors turned out to be true when the alien invasion of Earth finally began. Massive blood-red ships descended from the skies, their size intimidating and their appearance foreboding. The world was caught off guard, and within a matter of days, the aliens had taken over most of the major cities.

People were terrified, the streets of major cities deserted, the only sound was that of the alien cavalry riding around on their horses. Yes, you read that right - horses. For some unexplainable reason, these fearsome yet humanoid creatures chose to use swords and ride around on their horses, just like knights from a medieval age.

I had been one of those who refused to believe in the rumors of an alien invasion. That all changed when I heard the screams coming from the street. Looking out my window, I saw one of the alien cavalry charge towards a group of civilians, their sabers glistening in the sunrays.

I felt petrified, imagining what could happen to me if these creatures caught me. I knew I could not just sit back and watch as my family, friends, and fellow humans were killed. I had to act, and I had to do it fast.

I quickly gathered a few supplies, just enough to last me about a week, and made my way out of the city. The streets were deserted, and it was eerily quiet. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest with every step I took, fearful of what could be around the corner.

But as I had soon discovered, the fear was justified. As I turned the corner, I found myself confronted by a group of the alien cavalry, charging towards me at full speed. I froze, staring at them as they rode closer and closer.

Surprisingly, they did not seem to be interested in engaging me in combat. Instead, they galloped past me and continued down the road, leaving me shaken but unharmed. I let out a sigh of relief, happy to be alive.

As I continued to make my way through the deserted city, I came across several groups of survivors just like me, people who had managed to escape the wrath of the alien invasion. We banded together, forming a makeshift community, and we worked together to try and survive.

It was not easy, but we had to adapt to the circumstances. We learned to scavenge what was left of the city for supplies, finding everything from canned food to batteries to even precious medical supplies. We built our own shelter, barricading ourselves in to avoid the aliens at all costs.

Strangely enough, the aliens seemed to be focused on something else. They had taken over the major cities, but had not really ventured out to the countryside. In fact, it seemed like the further away you got from the city, the less likely you were to encounter the aliens. It was as if they had a specific goal in mind, but we couldn't figure out what it was.

We had been surviving for several weeks when we heard rumors of a base camp located deep in the woods. Supposedly, it was a stronghold for the aliens, their main hub of operations. For some reason, we knew we had to go there, to figure out what they were planning and how to put a stop to it.

At dawn, we set out towards the camp. It was a dangerous mission, and we all knew it could cost us our lives. But we had to try. We made our way through several kilometers of dense woods, avoiding the alien cavalry as much as possible.

It was nightfall by the time we reached the camp. It was massive, and we had grossly underestimated how many aliens would be there. We could see them patrolling the perimeter, guarding what was obviously their main base of operations.

Despite the odds being against us, we decided to attack. We moved in stealthily, taking out guards and sentries along the way. We moved further and further into the camp, taking out any alien we could find.

And then suddenly, we found it. Their true purpose in invading Earth. In the center of the camp, there was a massive spaceship. It was unlike any we had ever seen before, filled with all manner of sophisticated technology. It was clear that the aliens had come to Earth in search of something, perhaps as a prelude to a greater invasion.

With this knowledge in hand, we destroyed the spaceship and any other machinery we could find. We got out of there as fast as we could, hoping that we had done enough damage to put an end to their plans.

The weeks following the attack, the alien cavalry vanished from the world. The attacks stopped, their ships gone, as if they had abandoned their plans to invade Earth. We would never know for sure why they had come, or where they had gone.

But what we did know, was that in the face of that invasion, we had survived and prevented the aliens from achieving their goals. Together, we had proven that even against the greatest odds, humanity could persevere and overcome.
