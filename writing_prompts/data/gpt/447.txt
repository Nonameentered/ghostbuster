I heard the footsteps getting louder and closer. I knew I had to move fast if I wanted to survive. The last game I played was "Resident Evil 7" and the main character, Ethan Winters, was hunting me down.

I had no idea why, but the moment he set his sights on me, I knew I was in for a world of trouble. Ethan was a tough son of a gun and he had all sorts of weapons and skills that made him a deadly opponent.

I quickly peeked out from behind the wall and saw Ethan stalking towards me with his shotgun at the ready. I knew I had to think fast, so I ran down a hallway and ducked into a nearby room.

I closed the door behind me and locked it, hoping that would give me enough time to come up with a plan. But then I heard the sound of glass shattering as Ethan broke through a nearby window.

I knew I was running out of time. I scanned the room quickly and noticed a crowbar leaning against the wall. It wasn't much, but it was better than nothing. I grabbed the crowbar and prepared myself for a fight.

Ethan burst through the door, his shotgun raised and ready to fire. But I was quick and I swung my crowbar with all my might, hitting Ethan right in the gut. He stumbled back and dropped his shotgun.

I wasted no time and lunged at him, trying to take him down, but he was quick and he grabbed me by the collar of my shirt. He lifted me off my feet and pinned me against the wall, his hand tightening around my neck.

I struggled to breathe as he stared at me with cold, dead eyes.

"You can't escape me," he growled. "I always find my prey."

And with that, he threw me to the ground and walked out of the room, leaving me gasping for air and wondering how I'd managed to survive.
