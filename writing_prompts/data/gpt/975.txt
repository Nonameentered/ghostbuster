The news of alien invasion spellbound the world. Intergalactic Law stated that their most average champion would come to Earth to win the planet. It sounded like a game of sorts, but the stakes were higher, and the Earth had to be won.

The aliens sent a device that would choose the most average human to fight the champion. I never thought that I would be the one to accept the challenge and duel for fate. The device blinked and whirred, and I found myself hauled onto an alien spaceship.

The aliens sent their champion, Krog, to represent them. Krog had a massive stature much like the weightlifters on Earth, but was average in every other aspect. They did not want to use their best warriors as Earth wasnâ€™t their top priority.

While Krog flexed his muscles, I strategized a plan to fight him. But, as the duel began, I quickly realized that Krog was far more intense than I anticipated. Krog had the strength and physique, but I had agility and speed.

Krog lunged at me with brute force, and I dodged with a backflip and landed a solid punch to his abdomen. Krog was taken aback by my movement, and I saw my opening. I landed a few more quick punches, which dazed him.

The battle ended with me pinning Krog to the ground. The crowd went wild and cheered at my victory.

In the end, I saved the Earth from annihilation, and my name was etched in history. I was no longer an average human, but a symbol of hope for humanity.
