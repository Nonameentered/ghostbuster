It started with a simple argument. My coworker and I disagreed about the best way to complete a project at work. But instead of listening to each other's ideas, it escalated into a shouting match. I stormed out of the office, angry and frustrated.

That night, I couldn't sleep. The argument replayed in my head, fuelling my anger. I started to feel like everyone was against me - my coworkers, my family, even my friends. I became paranoid and distrustful.

A few days later, I was walking home from the grocery store when a group of teenagers surrounded me. They were taunting me, calling me names. I didn't understand why they would target me - I had never seen them in my life. They started pushing me, and I felt like I was going to be beaten up.

Suddenly, something inside me snapped. I lashed out, hitting one of them with a beer bottle I was carrying. The others ran away, and I was left standing there, shocked and bloody-handed. I felt a surge of power - finally, I had asserted myself and fought back.

Over the next few weeks, I found myself getting into more and more fights. I would lash out at anyone who crossed me, even strangers on the street. I started carrying a weapon with me at all times, just in case.

But as the violence escalated, so did my fear. I was terrified of getting caught, of going to jail. And yet, I couldn't stop. The rush I felt after each confrontation was addictive. It was like I was invincible.

One night, I was walking home from a bar when a man started following me. I didn't know him, but I felt like he was out to get me. I turned around and pulled out my knife, ready to defend myself. But as we started to fight, I realized with horror that I was the aggressor. I was the one attacking him, out of fear and paranoia.

And that's when I knew I had to stop. I couldn't let this cycle of violence continue. I turned myself in to the police and admitted everything. It wasn't easy - I knew I would face consequences for my actions. But I also knew it was the right thing to do.

Looking back, I realize that my descent into anger and violence wasn't entirely my fault. There were underlying issues that had been building up for years. But that doesn't excuse what I did. I hurt people, and that's something I'll have to live with for the rest of my life.

I'm currently undergoing therapy to try and understand why I acted the way I did. It's a slow process, but I'm hopeful that I can change. I don't want to be that angry, violent person anymore. I want to be someone who can listen to others, who can work through conflicts without resorting to violence.

It's a long road ahead, but I'm determined to get there. I hope that others who feel lost and alone can learn from my mistakes and seek help before it's too late.
