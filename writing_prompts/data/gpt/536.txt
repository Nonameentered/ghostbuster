God exists, and it answers one prayer per person exactly as asked. Everyone wasted their prayer without knowing while they were younger, but you never prayed until you were in your twenties. You pray for something noticeable.
I never really believed in God until I turned twenty. It wasn't a lack of faith, but rather a lack of interest in spirituality. However, I always heard people in my life talk about praying, so I knew it was a common practice.

When I finally decided to give prayer a try, I knew that I wanted to be intentional about it. I didn't want to waste my one shot at having a prayer answered without even realizing it. So, I took my time and thought about what I really wanted to ask for.

I decided to pray for something noticeable. Something that would confirm to me that God really does exist and that He does listen to our prayers. So, I gathered my thoughts and spoke my prayer aloud.

"Dear God, if you do exist and you can hear me, I ask that you show me a sign of your presence in my life. Something that cannot be explained by coincidence or chance. Please let me know that you are real and that you are with me."

I remember feeling a little silly after I finished praying. After all, I had no idea if anyone was listening, let alone God. But I had faith that something would happen.

It wasn't until several days later that I noticed the sign. I was walking down the street and happened to glance down at the sidewalk. There, etched into the concrete, was the word "hope." It was like it had been put there just for me.

I knew in that moment that my prayer had been answered. It wasn't a huge, life-changing event, but it was noticeable and personal to me. It was then that I realized the power of prayer and the existence of God.

From that moment on, I made sure to pray every day. Sometimes, they were small and simple prayers, like asking for guidance or comfort. Other times, they were bigger requests, like healing for a loved one.

But I never forgot that first prayer, and the way that God answered it in a way that was perfect for me. It taught me to be intentional about my prayers and to always have faith that He is listening.
