You (the real you) encounter a bridge troll as you walk across a bridge. Now he has to ask you a riddle, and you're not crossing his bridge until you solve it.
As I walked across the rickety old wooden bridge, I noticed a strange figure standing in my way. It was a troll, with a hunchback and hideous features. He looked at me with his beady red eyes and growled, "Who goes there?"

"It's just me," I replied nervously.

"Aha!" he exclaimed. "A human! I am the bridge troll, and if you want to cross my bridge you must answer my riddle. Fail to answer correctly, and you will never cross this bridge again."

I swallowed hard, wondering what kind of riddle this troll had in store for me. He cleared his throat and began, "What is the beginning of eternity, the end of time and space, the beginning of every end, and the end of every race?"

I furrowed my brow, racking my brain for an answer. I had always been decent at riddles, but this one was throwing me off. I paced back and forth, thinking out loud as I tried to come up with a solution.

"The beginning of eternityâ€¦ the end of time and space," I muttered. Suddenly, it clicked. "I think I got it," I said confidently. "The answer is the letter 'e'."

The troll stared at me, his face contorting in a mixture of surprise and annoyance. "You're right," he said begrudgingly. "Most humans can't solve my riddles so easily. Very well, you may cross my bridge."

I let out a sigh of relief as I stepped past the troll, continuing on my journey. As I walked, I couldn't help but wonder why this troll was so keen on riddles. Maybe he was just bored and needed a form of entertainment, or maybe he was testing travelers for some greater purpose.

Suddenly, I heard a voice behind me. "Hey, wait up!" The troll had followed me across the bridge. "I have a proposition for you," he said.

I turned to face him, wary of what he might say next. "What kind of proposition?" I asked.

"I'm tired of sitting here all day, asking riddles to travelers. I want to do something more meaningful with my life. But I can't do it alone. I need help from someone like you."

I raised an eyebrow, unsure of what he was getting at. "What kind of help do you need?"

The troll leaned in closer, his voice lowering to a whisper. "I'm planning a revolution. I want to overthrow the king of the trolls and establish a more democratic society. But I can't do it without allies. Will you help me?"

I was stunned. I had never expected to hear something like this from a bridge troll. It made sense though; trolls were often marginalized by society, leaving them with few options for changing their circumstances. I could see how this troll was hoping to change that.

"Okay, I'll help," I said, feeling a sense of excitement at the prospect of being part of something bigger than myself.

From that day forward, the troll and I worked tirelessly to win over other trolls to our cause. We held secret meetings under the bridge, strategized late into the night, and eventually gained a strong following. When the time came for the revolution, we were ready.

Together, we marched on the king's castle and fought for our cause. It was a difficult battle, but in the end, we emerged victorious. The troll I had once met on the bridge was elected as the new leader, and he worked tirelessly to improve the lives of all trolls. It was an inspiring moment, one that I never could have predicted when I first encountered that bridge troll.
