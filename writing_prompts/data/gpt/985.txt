My heart raced as I sat in the debriefing room with my new comrades, all of us donning the elite black ops uniforms of the CIA. The year was 2050, and I had just been transferred to one of the most secretive divisions of the agency: the historical figure assassination division. As the lead agent began to speak, my mind wandered, trying to grasp the enormity of what I was about to do.

"Time travel is real," the agent's voice broke through my thoughts. "And it's being used. You have been handpicked to join our ranks as we eliminate key historical figures whose actions have led to catastrophic events in our time."

My heart raced faster. "Your next target is JFK. You will be sent back to 1963 with a single mission: to prevent his assassination. If successful, you will change the course of history for the better. Failure is not an option."

As the group dispersed, I found myself alone, trying to wrap my head around the gravity of what I was about to do. I had always wanted to serve my country, but this went far beyond anything I had ever imagined. I would have to blend in with the people of 1963 and stop Kennedy's killer from pulling the trigger.

As I traveled back in time, I knew the fate of the world rested on my shoulders. If I could prevent JFK's assassination, who knew what else I could change? But as I stepped off the platform into 1963, all I could think was: What have I done?
