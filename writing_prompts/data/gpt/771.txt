You are in a crowded, noisy train station when suddenly everyone disappears. Except for a little girl.
John had been waiting for his train for twenty minutes when suddenly, everyone around him vanished. The noise of the bustling station was replaced by an eerie silence. Confused and startled, John looked around, trying to make sense of what was happening.

At first, he wondered if he was having a surreal experience. Maybe he was dreaming? But the chill of the empty station crawled up his spine and grabbed his attention. He looked to the clock hanging on the opposite wall, but it didn't function as everything else. It was static and unwavering, frozen in time. It made the situation even more bizarre.

But then he saw her â€“ a little girl, standing inert in the centre of the station. She was around four or five and had curly brown hair, big brown eyes, and a tiny pink backpack. She looked up at him, and he could see her confusion mirrored his.

"Hey," John called out, walking towards her. "Are you okay? What happened?"

But she just tilted her head, looking at him with an expression that told him she had no answer.

He tried not to panic. He looked beyond the station window; the sky was dark, and a storm was brewing. He knew he had to get himself and the girl out of there, quick. The danger of staying there was too great, especially with no train in sight.

John approached the little girl. "Hi, my name is John. What's your name?"

She looked at him with uncertainty, but her big, brown eyes softened as she said, "Sophie."

"Okay, Sophie. We need to get out of here."

John reached out, and Sophie placed her tiny hand in his. Together they walked towards the entrance, but as they stepped outside, the world had changed; it was no longer the crowded street that had surrounded the station. The buildings were still there, but they were hollow and lifeless, like a forgotten city. The streets were empty and grey with a distant light that illuminated the sky from the horizon.

John stopped, his eyes in disbelief. The only thing he could think about was the girl holding his hand, as his hope for an answer escaped him.

"Sophie, did you see what happened to everyone?" he said, looking down at her.

Sophie shook her little head, and a knot formed in John's stomach. They were alone in a world without people.

As they made their way through the deserted streets, John kept Sophie close. He couldn't ignore the eerie silence or the unexplained disappearance and felt incredibly isolated.

But then Sophie's little hand tugged on his sleeve and pointed to a man walking down the street. It was Michael, John's brother, who had died suddenly three years ago.

John's heart raced as he ran towards him, but as he got closer, Michael vanished in front of John's eyes.

The realization hit him like a freight train. This world they were in must be some kind of purgatory or limbo. John couldn't tell if the people he saw were illusions of the world they left behind.

John felt he didn't have much time left, and the rush of adrenaline surging in his veins made him realize that he needed to find a way out of this place.

He picked up Sophie and began running, looking for answers or a way to escape. After some time, they reached a building with an elevator, and John pushed the button. The doors slid open, revealing a long, dark tunnel.

John hesitated for a moment, feeling unsure if he should risk it, but he knew they couldn't stay in this purgatory. And so, with Sophie in his arms, John stepped into the elevator and began descending.

Finally, the elevator came to a halt, and the doors opened once more. A bright light flooded the room and a gust of wind blasted them back. John held Sophie close and took a step out of the elevator.

John took a deep breath of the warm air and looked around; people were coming and going, taxis honking, and trains arriving and departing.

John was back in the real world, alive and well.

Sophie was an angel, a guide who showed him the way back to reality.

John let out a deep sigh, feeling blessed to be alive and grateful for little Sophie, who led him to salvation.
