There were few things that Joshua loved more than spending time in the woods. It was a place where he felt at peace with the world and could let his mind wander. He had stumbled upon a small cabin on one of his trips a few weeks ago, and since then, it had become his go-to spot.

One afternoon, as he was walking through the dense forest, something caught his eye. It was a clearing just beyond the bend of a small stream. Joshua couldn't believe his eyes. In the center of the clearing, there were three giant stones standing in a triangle formation. They looked like they had been there for thousands of years.

Curiosity got the best of him, and Joshua walked closer to the stones. He noticed that they were covered in strange symbols and markings. They looked as though they had been chiseled into the stone by hand.

He walked around each of the stones, studying the symbols. They were unlike anything he had ever seen before. For a moment, he wondered if it was some sort of ancient code, lost to time and forgotten by man.

Suddenly, there was a loud crackling sound, and Joshua jumped back. The air around the stones seemed to shimmer and warp. He felt a wave of dizziness wash over him, and he stumbled backward, his legs failing to hold him up. His vision went black, and he fell into unconsciousness.

When Joshua awoke, he was inside a dark cavern. The walls were slick with moisture. He could hear the sound of rushing water, but he couldn't see where it was coming from. He tried to move, but he was bound tightly to the ground by thick vines.

Suddenly, a figure emerged from the darkness. It was a woman, tall and imposing, wearing a long, flowing robe. Her hair was the color of silver, and her eyes sparkled like diamonds. In her hand, she held a staff adorned with strange symbols.

"Who...who are you?" Joshua stuttered, his voice barely above a whisper.

The woman smiled down at him. "I am Amaia, one of the Sentinels of Time," she said. "And you, young one, have found yourself in a very dangerous situation."

Joshua's mind was reeling. Sentinels of Time? Dangerous situation? What was going on?

Amaia must have sensed his confusion because she continued, "Those stones you found in the forest, they are sacred. They are a portal through time, and you stumbled upon them without realizing their true power. You are lucky we found you before someone or something else did."

Joshua tried to sit up, but the vines only tightened around him. "What do you mean, portal through time?" he asked.

Amaia sighed, "The Sentinels of Time were appointed by the gods to ensure the balance of time and protect the timeline. We watch over the portal and make sure that nothing alters the course of history. It is our duty to preserve the past, the present, and the future for all living things. But sometimes, humans stumble upon the portal without knowing its significance and cause irreversible damage to the timeline."

Joshua was still trying to make sense of all of this when Amaia suddenly disappeared. The vines holding him down loosened, and he stood up, rubbing his wrists.

As his eyes adjusted to the darkness, he noticed a path leading further into the cavern. He started to walk, and soon he could hear the sound of voices echoing off the walls.

When he emerged into a large chamber, he was surprised to see a group of people gathered around a large table. They all wore robes similar to Amaia's and had staffs adorned with different symbols.

"Welcome, young one," said a man who sat at the head of the table. "My name is Urien, and I am the leader of the Sentinels of Time. You must be wondering what all of this is about."

Joshua nodded, taking a seat at the table.

Urien continued, "As Amaia explained, our job is to protect the timeline. But sometimes, even we need help. That's where you come in. You have seen what we do, and now it's time for you to decide: Will you join us and become a Sentinel of Time?"

Joshua thought about it for a moment. The idea of protecting time and preserving history was tempting. But he wasn't sure he was up for the task.

Urien sensed his hesitation and continued, "I know this is a lot to ask of you. But think about what it means to be a Sentinel of Time. The power to shape the course of history is a great responsibility, but it's also an honor. Your name will go down in history as one of the few brave enough to stand up for the equilibrium of time."

Joshua thought about it for a moment, and then he made his decision. "I'll do it," he said firmly.

Urien smiled, "Excellent choice, young one. You will need to undergo training, of course, but I have a feeling that you will make an excellent Sentinel of Time."

As Joshua left the caverns, he couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement mingled with apprehension. He had signed up for something that would change his life forever. But at the same time, he couldn't wait to embark on this new journey and discover the secrets of time.
