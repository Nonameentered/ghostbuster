Nobody believed me when I said there was a killer on the loose. Not my friends, not my family, not even the police. But I knew what I had seen that night in the woods. I knew that it wasn't just my imagination playing tricks on me.

It had started as a simple camping trip with my friends. We had all been looking forward to getting away from the chaos of the city for a few days and just enjoying the peacefulness of nature. But on the second night, everything changed.

We had been sitting around the campfire, roasting marshmallows and telling spooky stories, when we heard a twig snap in the woods. At first, we all laughed it off as just an animal passing through, but then we heard it again. This time, it was closer. And then we saw it.

A figure emerged from the shadows and started slowly walking towards us. We couldn't see its face, but we could sense something malevolent in its presence. None of us wanted to believe what we were seeing, but we all knew that something was very wrong.

Before we could even react, the figure lunged towards us, brandishing a knife. It all happened so quickly that we didn't even have time to scream. I remember trying to dodge the blows, but it was no use. The killer was too fast, too skilled. And in the blink of an eye, my friends were all dead.

I managed to escape into the woods, running blindly in the darkness. I don't know how long I ran for, but eventually I stumbled upon a ranger station and called for help. But when the police arrived, they found no evidence of the attack. There were no bodies, no signs of a struggle. It was as if my friends had never existed.

For weeks, I was haunted by nightmares and visions of the killer. I couldn't shake the feeling that it was still out there, waiting to strike again. But nobody believed me. They all thought I was crazy, delusional. Even my therapist told me that it was just a figment of my imagination, a coping mechanism for the trauma.

But I knew the truth. And I was determined to find the killer before it could hurt anyone else.

Over the next few months, I became obsessed with the case. I pored over every detail, every possible lead. I even started following people I suspected might be the killer, hoping to catch them in the act. But nothing ever turned up.

Until one day, I received a package in the mail. It was a letter from the killer. At first, I was terrified. But then I realized that this was my chance to finally catch them.

The letter was cryptic and fraught with typos, but it contained a clue that led me to a rundown motel on the outskirts of town. I checked into the room they had specified and waited for them to arrive.

It was a long and tense wait. I had a knife tucked into my jacket, ready to defend myself if needed. But I was also hopeful that I could reason with the killer, find out why they had done what they had done.

And then they walked through the door.

At first, I was shocked. It wasn't anyone I knew, anyone I had ever suspected. It was just a plain-looking man in his mid-thirties, with dull eyes and a flat expression. But then he spoke.

"I know why you're here," he said in a monotone voice. "You want answers."

I nodded, my heart pounding in my chest.

"It wasn't about your friends," he continued. "It was about you."

"What do you mean?" I asked, not sure if I really wanted to know the answer.

"I've been following you for years," he said. "Watching you, learning everything about you. You were the target all along."

I was speechless. I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

"Why me?" I finally managed to ask.

He shrugged. "You remind me of someone I once knew. Someone who hurt me deeply. I wanted to make you suffer like I did."

"But my friends...why did they have to die?"

He looked at me for a long moment, as if deciding whether or not to answer.

"I wanted you to feel the pain of losing someone you care about," he finally said. "I wanted you to know what it's like to feel helpless and alone."

I could feel tears streaming down my face, a mixture of anger and sadness and fear.

"You're sick," I spat out.

He shrugged again. "Maybe. But I'm not sorry."

I lunged at him then, my knife flashing in the dim light of the motel room. We struggled for what felt like hours, the sound of our breathing and grunting filling the air. But in the end, I emerged victorious. The killer lay on the ground, blood pooling around him.

As I stumbled out of the motel room and into the early morning light, I knew that my life would never be the same. The trauma of what had happened would haunt me for years to come. But at least I had closure. At least I knew the truth.

And maybe, just maybe, I could start to heal.
