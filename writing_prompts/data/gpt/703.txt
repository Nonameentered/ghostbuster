It was a red eye flight, the kind of flight no one wants to take. But Angela didn't have a choice, she had to get to New York for a meeting early in the morning. She had been to the airport several hours before her flight, hoping to get some work done and kill time before boarding. As the hours passed, Angela noticed the other passengers in the airport dwindling until it was just her and a few others waiting for their flights.

At midnight, she boarded the plane and took her seat at the window. There were only a handful of people in the plane, and she was grateful for the privacy. As the plane took off, Angela put her headphones on and closed her eyes, hoping to get some rest before the meeting.

She was abruptly awakened by a loud noise that sounded like the plane was breaking apart. She jolted upright, ripping off her headphones. The cabin was dark, and the plane was shaking violently. Angela's eyes searched the cabin for some sort of indication as to what was happening. Her heart was beating so fast that she thought she was going to pass out.

It was then that the pilot's voice came on the intercom, "Ladies and gentlemen, we have lost an engine, and we need to make an emergency landing. Please remain calm and follow the instructions of the cabin crew."

Angela's heart sank - it was her worst fear coming to life. She looked out the window, hoping to see some sort of sign of hope - but there was none. The plane was in complete darkness. Everything was eerily still.

The cabin crew started to move smarter now, and the plane was descending rapidly. One of the flight attendants was making her way down the aisle, telling everyone to fasten their seat belts and stay calm.

Angela gripped the armrests until her knuckles turned white. She stared out the window, praying for a miracle. The flight attendant made her way to Angela's row and instructed her to brace for a crash landing.

The seconds that followed were a blur. The plane crashed into the ground, and everything went black.

When Angela opened her eyes, she could see fire. The plane was on fire, and people were screaming and running for the exits. Her head was spinning, and she wasn't sure what had just happened. All she could think about was getting out of there alive.

She unbuckled her seat belt and tried to stand up, but her legs were shaky, and her head was throbbing. The smoke was thick, and she could barely see anything. She heard someone calling for help, but their voice was muffled.

Angela started crawling towards the sound, tears streaming down her face. Her throat was sore, and she was starting to cough uncontrollably.

She finally saw the source of the voice - a little girl was crying for her mother who was nowhere to be found. Angela picked up the girl and held her tight. She could feel the heat of the fire, and she knew they had to get out fast.

She stumbled towards the emergency exit, holding onto the little girl. The cabin was chaos, and people were pushing and shoving to get out. Angela tripped and fell, hitting her head on the metal frame of a seat. She could feel blood gushing from her forehead.

The last thing she remembered was someone picking her up and carrying her out of the cabin. She tried to open her eyes, but everything was a blur.

When Angela finally regained consciousness, she was in a hospital bed with her head bandaged and her body covered in bruises. She asked the nurse what had happened to the passengers and crew, and her heart sank as the nurse told her that many people had died, but she had miraculously survived.

Angela never forgot that fateful red eye flight. It had changed her life forever. She realized how fragile human life was and how she had taken it for granted. From that day on, she lived every moment of her life to the fullest and appreciated every second she had with her loved ones. Because in an instant, it could all be taken away.
