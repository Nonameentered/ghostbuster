You can't kill me, not today.
As she lay bleeding on the ground, she whispered under her breath, "You can't kill me, not today." She had no strength left in her body, but her spirit refused to be broken. Death had been looming over her for weeks, yet she had refused to surrender to it. She had fought with every ounce of energy she had, clinging to the hope that she might just survive.

It had been a dangerous mission, something that she had never encountered before. Despite being warned about the risks involved, she had taken it up with enthusiasm, believing that nothing could stop her. She had been wrong. But even now, as her heart beat slowed and darkness crept in, she knew that she would never let them win. They may take her body, but her spirit would live on, stronger and more determined than ever.

And so, as her breaths grew shallow and her eyes closed, she held onto the thought, "You can't kill me, not today."
