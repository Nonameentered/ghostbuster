'You see detective; that wasn't the scary part. The scary part wasn't realizing I was the monster everyone thought I was. The scary part was realizing I didn't mind being that monster.'
Detective Madison sat across from the suspect. She had seen murderers, thieves, and other criminals, but there was something unsettling about this one. He sat calmly, his eyes fixated on her, as if he was trying to read her thoughts. She cleared her throat and began, "Mr. Johnson, can you tell me what happened that night?"

He leaned back in his chair and sighed. "I should've known I would end up here," he said, his voice lacking any emotion. "I always knew I was different, but I never thought I would end up being a monster."

Madison raised an eyebrow. "What do you mean, Mr. Johnson?"

"I mean, I always had these dark thoughts in my head. Thoughts of violence, of hurting people. I tried to suppress them, but it was like a part of me wanted to give in to those thoughts."

Madison felt a shiver run down her spine. This was not going to be an ordinary case. "Can you tell me what happened on the night of the murder?"

"I was walking home from work when I saw her. She was just standing there, looking lost. I don't know what came over me, but I couldn't resist. I followed her, and before I knew it, I had her in my arms."

Madison felt sick to her stomach. This was the kind of monster she had dealt with before, the kind that preyed on innocent victims. "What did you do to her?"

"I didn't mean to hurt her," he said, his eyes filling with tears. "But once I started, I couldn't stop. It was like all those dark thoughts in my head finally had an outlet. And when it was over, I felt...satisfied."

Madison shook her head in disbelief. "That's not normal, Mr. Johnson. You can't go around attacking people just because you have violent thoughts in your head."

He looked up at her, his eyes hardening. "You see, detective; that wasn't the scary part. The scary part wasn't realizing I was the monster everyone thought I was. The scary part was realizing I didn't mind being that monster."

Madison felt a chill run down her spine. This was not a man who had acted out of impulse. This was someone who relished in the pain he caused. "Do you have any remorse for what you've done?"

He looked down at his hands, his fingers tracing the scar on his knuckles. "I used to have nightmares about what I did. I would wake up in a cold sweat, screaming. But then, something changed. Those nightmares became dreams, and those dreams became fantasies. I started to enjoy reliving what I did, over and over again."

Madison felt a wave of disgust wash over her. She had heard enough. "Mr. Johnson, you are under arrest for the murder of Anna Stevens. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law."

As Madison led him out of the room, she couldn't help but think about what he had said. What kind of person could enjoy being a monster? What kind of person could do the things he did?

She knew that this case would haunt her for a long time. The images of Anna Stevens' mutilated body would stay with her forever. But what scared her the most was the thought that there were others out there like Mr. Johnson, people who embraced their dark thoughts and enjoyed being monsters.

As she walked back to her office, she made a vow to herself. She would stop the monsters, no matter how dark their thoughts were. She would keep the streets safe, so that no one else had to experience the horror that Anna Stevens went through.

Because in the end, that was all that mattered. Protecting the innocent, and stopping the monsters.
