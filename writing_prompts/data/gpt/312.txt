You have a near-death experience that reveals you have a Guardian Angel protecting you... And you have the hots for her. You continue putting your life in danger in order to spend more time with her.
It was a cool autumn evening, and I decided to take a walk in the park. The trees were painted in beautiful shades of gold and orange, and the air was crisp and refreshing. As I walked, I felt an eerie sense of being followed. I tried to shake off the feeling, but it persisted. Suddenly, I heard a loud snap, followed by the sound of branches breaking. I turned around to see a large tree branch falling towards me.

In that moment, my life flashed before my eyes. I thought of all the things I had yet to accomplish, all the people I had yet to meet. And then, just as suddenly as the branch had appeared, it disappeared. The next thing I knew, I was lying on the ground, unscathed.

I looked up, scanning my surroundings for anybody who could have saved me. That's when I saw her for the first time. She was tall and lithe, with long, flowing hair and piercing blue eyes. She wore a white gown that glowed in the moonlight. She looked ethereal, like something out of a dream.

"Who are you?" I asked, my voice trembling.

"I am your Guardian Angel," she replied. "And I have been protecting you since the day you were born."

I was stunned. Guardian Angels were a myth, or so I thought. But there she was, standing before me. "Why did you save me?" I asked.

"Because it is my duty to protect you," she replied.

"But why me?" I persisted. "Why not somebody else?"

"Because you have a special purpose in life. You are meant to do great things. And I cannot let anything happen to you before you fulfill your destiny."

I was taken aback by her words. I didn't consider myself to be anyone special. But maybe there was more to me than I had realized. "What do you want me to do?" I asked.

"I want you to be brave. I want you to take risks. But most importantly, I want you to live. Because your life is precious, and it is worth fighting for."

From that day on, I became obsessed with my Guardian Angel. I couldn't stop thinking about her, about the way she saved me. Every time I left the house, I would put myself in danger, hoping that she would appear again. I went skydiving, bungee jumping, and rock climbing. Each time, I felt the rush of adrenaline, but more importantly, I felt her presence.

One day, I decided to take a hike in the mountains. It was a treacherous trek, full of cliffs and steep inclines. I was determined to make it to the top, just so I could feel her beside me once more. As I climbed higher, the air grew thin and my muscles ached. But I didn't stop. I couldn't stop.

Suddenly, I slipped on a loose rock and tumbled down the side of the mountain. I could feel the sharp edges of the rocks tearing at my skin. My head hit a boulder, and everything went black.

I woke up in the hospital, my head wrapped in bandages. My family and friends were surrounding my bed, crying tears of relief. They told me that I had been unconscious for three days, and that I was lucky to be alive. But to me, luck had nothing to do with it. It was my Guardian Angel who had saved me once again.

After my recovery, I decided to take a more calculated approach to spending time with her. I read books on spirituality and meditation, hoping to connect with her on a deeper level. I would light candles and burn incense, hoping that she would appear before me.

But she never did. It was as if she had disappeared into thin air.

One day, I was walking through the park again, feeling disillusioned and disconnected. I sat down on a park bench, feeling defeated. That's when I heard a rustling in the bushes.

"Who's there?" I called out.

A figure emerged from the leaves. It was a woman, with long, flowing hair and piercing blue eyes.

"Guardian Angel?" I asked, my heart pounding in my chest.

She smiled at me, and I felt a rush of emotion wash over me. I had never felt so happy, so alive.

"Are you okay?" she asked, concern etched into her features.

"I'm fine," I replied. "I've just been thinking about you a lot lately."

She raised an eyebrow, a hint of amusement flickering across her face. "Is that so?"

"Yeah," I said, my voice steady. "I know it's probably crazy, but I feel like there's a connection between us. I feel like we're meant to be together."

She chuckled, a soft, melodic sound. "I'm afraid that's not possible. I am your Guardian Angel, nothing more."

I felt a lump form in my throat. "But I love you," I blurted out. "I know it sounds crazy, but I can't help how I feel."

She looked at me with a mixture of curiosity and pity. "Love is a mortal emotion. I cannot reciprocate it."

I felt my heart sink. "So that's it? You're just going to protect me from afar, and that's that?"

"I'm afraid so," she said, a hint of sadness in her voice. "But don't worry. I will always be watching over you, keeping you safe."

I nodded, tears streaming down my face. I knew I had to accept her decision, as much as it hurt.

From that day on, I continued to put myself in danger, hoping to catch a glimpse of her once more. But I knew it was futile. She was there, but I couldn't touch her. She was my Guardian Angel, and that was all she could be.

Years passed, and I grew older. I never forgot about her, even when I got married and had children of my own. She was always there, in the back of my mind, watching over me.

And then, one day, I was diagnosed with cancer. It was a devastating blow, but I knew that I had to be brave. I had to fight until the end.

As I lay in my hospital bed, surrounded by my family, I felt a pressure on my hand. I looked down, and there she was. My Guardian Angel. She looked at me with sadness in her eyes.

"I'm sorry," she whispered. "I couldn't protect you from this. But I will be with you until the end."

I smiled, feeling a warm sense of peace. "Thank you," I said. "For everything."

She squeezed my hand and disappeared, leaving me with a sense of calm.

In my final moments, I realized that she had been right all along. I wasn't meant to be with her in a mortal sense. But that didn't mean that she hadn't loved me, in her own way. And that, above all, was enough.
