I woke up with an intense feeling of hatred. I didn't understand why, but my heart was pounding with anger. It was only when I closed my eyes that I saw the face of my murderer. 

I had been reincarnated. And from what I could remember, I had been murdered in my previous life. It was a terrifying feeling, knowing that the person who had taken my life was still out there. 

As the memories of my previous life came flooding back, I remembered the name of my killer. It was someone who I had trusted, someone who I had loved. And now, knowing their identity, I couldn't just let them go free. 

I decided to investigate. In my current life, I had become a detective. It wasn't a coincidence; I was drawn to the profession because I wanted to seek justice for myself. 

I began looking through old police reports and case files, trying to find any information on my killer. It took months, but eventually, I found what I was looking for.

My killer was still living in the same town as they had when they killed me. They were now an old man, living alone in a small house on the outskirts of town. 

I didn't hesitate; I went to their house and confronted them. At first, they didn't recognize me. But as I spoke, they slowly began to understand. 

"I remember everything," I told them. "I remember how you killed me." 

They broke down in tears, begging for forgiveness. I didn't know if I could forgive them, but I knew I couldn't just walk away. They needed to face justice for what they had done. 

I called the police and reported the murder. They came to arrest my killer, who didn't resist. There was a sense of closure as I watched them being led away in handcuffs. 

But in the days that followed, I couldn't shake the feeling of anger and hatred that had consumed me. I realized that even though my killer had been caught, nothing could bring back the life that I had lost. 

Reincarnation may have given me the chance to seek justice, but it also left me with a sense of emptiness. I knew that I would never truly be able to move on from what had been taken from me.
