A famous pornstar signs up for a'do a fan' scene. Unexpectedly, when she meets him, she falls instantly head over heels in love with him. However, the oblivious fan interprets her advances as all being part of the scene they're filming.
As soon as she saw him, she knew she had made a mistake. She had signed up for a "do a fan" scene, thinking it would be fun, but as soon as she laid eyes on him, she felt something she hadn't felt in years: love.

He was cute, in a geeky sort of way, and he seemed genuinely excited to be working with her. She tried to keep her cool, to act professional, but she kept finding herself staring at him, lost in thought.

When they finally started filming, she couldn't help but flirt with him. She touched him more than she needed to, laughed at his jokes a little too hard, and found every excuse she could to get closer to him.

At first, he was confused by her behavior, but he just assumed it was all part of the scene. He was thrilled to be working with such a famous pornstar, and he wanted to do a good job.

As the day went on, though, he started to wonder if maybe there was something more going on. She seemed to be giving him a lot of attention, even when they weren't filming, and he couldn't help but feel a little nervous.

Finally, after they had wrapped up for the day, she cornered him in the dressing room. "I know this is going to sound crazy," she said, "but I think I might be in love with you."

He was stunned. "Wait, what? I thought this was all part of the scene."

She shook her head. "No, I swear. I'm really, really into you."

He looked at her for a moment, trying to make sense of it all. And then he smiled. "Well, in that case," he said, taking her hand, "I think I might be in love with you, too."
