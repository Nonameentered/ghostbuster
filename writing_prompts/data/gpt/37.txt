'I told you to make a small fire. That is NOT a small fire!'
Amelia and her friends, Lily and Sarah, decided to take a break from their daily routine and go camping. They planned for this trip for weeks and finally, the day came. They drove hours deep into the woods and found the perfect spot to set up camp. They gathered wood, pitched their tent, and started a fire. It was the perfect getaway, or so they thought.

Amelia instructed Lily and Sarah to make a small fire, so they could roast marshmallows and huddle around it for warmth. They decided to collect dry branches and twigs, but they got carried away. They piled the wood higher and higher, thinking it would keep them warm at night. It was the biggest fire they ever created.

As they sat, chatting away and roasting marshmallows, they suddenly heard footsteps approaching from the woods. They quickly turned around, and Sarah noticed something strange. “Guys, are those flames reaching the sky?” she exclaimed in disbelief. The fire that they thought was small was now a massive blaze. 

“Everyone pack up, NOW,” yelled Amelia in panic. They quickly started shoving everything back into their bags and tent. The fire grew more significant with every passing minute. Amelia called the emergency line, and the operator instructed them to leave immediately.

As they picked up their bags and started running away, Amelia had an eerie feeling that something was off. There was a rustling in the bushes, and suddenly, a figure emerged from the trees. It was an old man, and he looked at them with great concern. “You girls need to leave now, the fire is spreading fast,” he exclaimed. 

They rushed away, but Amelia still had a sinking feeling. They ran for what felt like hours, but they couldn’t seem to shake off the added weight of their bags and fear. They arrived at a clearing, but the old man was nowhere in sight. They decided to set up camp again, but this time, they were very cautious.

They talked until the wee hours of the morning. Lily and Sarah kept making light of the situation to calm Amelia’s shaken mind. After a while, the adrenaline wore off, and their bodies begged for rest. They entered their tent and passed out.

The sun was beaming bright into the tent by morning. They had a quiet breakfast and unanimously decided to leave early. Upon their return home, Amelia could not shake off her worries and did some research. That’s when she found an article from the 1920s. It was about an old man who had saved three girls from a wildfire that had spread to the nearby town. 

He later died in the fire, trying to help others. In his honor, the rest of the town placed three stones near the abandoned area he called “The Sanctuary.” It said that he can grant wishes to those in need, but he will also offer protection from fires. The stones were to be used as markers for the hikers who visited the site. As they read the article, shivers ran down their spines.

They weren’t sure if the old man was a figment of their imagination or a ghostly apparition, but his words guided them to safety. Amelia whispered a silent thank you to him as they packed up and left the campsite.

Looking back, they realized that things could have gone wrong in an instant. They learned that you should never take nature for granted and always respect its power. It could be humbling and unforgiving. It was a humbling experience for all of them, and they all had a newfound appreciation for life.

Amelia kept the stones, and they are now displayed in her living room. She always tells the story of the mysterious old man and how he saved their lives. It became a cautionary tale to those who took it for granted.

In the end, the girls decided to keep their experience private and only shared it with trusted friends. It was a life-changing experience, and they didn’t want to be ridiculed or judged for their choices. It was a memory that they shared individually, but it bonded them forever.
