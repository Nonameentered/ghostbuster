Satan had always been known as the ruler of the underworld - the prince of darkness. However, there was something that only a few knew about him: he was also a single parent to the babies and children sacrificed to him.

Being the leader of all evil, he was accustomed to taking care of the souls of the damned. But things got complicated when he realized that he had become responsible for the souls of the innocent. These babies and children had been taken away from their families and offered up to him as a form of worship. Although it was an honour to be sacrificed to him, it was not something that Satan wanted.

At first, Satan didn't know how to react. He was used to being feared and despised, not loved and adored. He was never someone who sought to have children, but now he had no choice. He had to take care of these children.

Satan tried his best to take care of them. He read them stories, played games with them and tried to make them feel at home. He even tried singing them lullabies to put them to sleep. He knew that it would take a lot of time and effort to gain their trust, but he was committed to doing it.

As he spent more time with them, he began to understand the meaning of fatherhood. Even though he wasn't their biological father, he knew that he had to be there for them. He had to make sure that they felt loved and protected.

However, it wasn't just Satan who had to deal with the challenges of raising these children. The souls of their parents were also in the underworld and were constantly looking for them. They felt guilty for sacrificing their children and wanted to be reunited with them.

Satan had to make a difficult decision. He knew that he couldn't keep the children away from their parents forever, but he also knew that their parents had committed a grave sin. In the end, Satan decided to let the parents see their children, but on one condition: they had to serve him in the underworld for eternity.

It wasn't an easy decision for Satan to make, but it was the right one. He understood the pain that the parents were going through, but he couldn't let them go without punishment for what they had done. In the end, Satan learned a lot about love, sacrifice and the importance of being a responsible parent.
