The world as we knew it changed 10 years ago when the Grim Reaper, the very being responsible for claiming lives, announced that he could no longer continue to do so directly. Instead, every person had a mark on their body that signified when their time on Earth was up.

When the announcement was first made, the world was in a state of chaos. People were scared and confused, not sure how to react to this news. Some people tried to hide their marks or go into hiding, hoping to prolong their inevitable death. Others became vigilantes, taking it upon themselves to carry out the grim task of killing those whose time had come.

As for me, well, I didn't know what to do. I was just an ordinary person, going about my job as a nurse and trying to live a simple life. But the mark on my wrist reminded me every day that my end was looming.

I remember the first time I saw the mark on someone else. It was a patient I was treating, an old man who had come in with pneumonia. As I was checking his vitals, I saw the mark on his forehead â€“ a small, intricate symbol that I had never seen before. I knew what it meant, though. His time had come.

I didn't know what to do. Should I call someone to come and take him away? Should I try to talk to him about it? But before I could do anything, the old man began to convulse. His eyes rolled back in his head, and his body began to spasm uncontrollably. I knew what was happening. The mark was taking over, and he was dying.

I watched in horror as the old man took his last breath. It was then that I knew that I had a duty to fulfill. As a member of this new society, it was my job to kill those whose time had come.

In the years that followed, I killed countless people. Each time, it got a little bit easier. I would see the mark on their body and know that I had no choice. It was my duty to carry out the grim task.

But over time, things started to change. People began to question whether this new system was truly fair. What about those who died suddenly, without warning? What about those who were killed before their time was up?

The world became divided, with those who supported the new system taking up arms against those who opposed it. It was a bloody and brutal time, with people killing each other left and right.

But for me, I had had enough. I had seen too much death and destruction, and I knew that there had to be a better way. So I decided to take matters into my own hands.

I started to research and experiment, trying to find a way to reverse the mark. I worked tirelessly, day and night, trying to find a cure for this new affliction that had befallen humanity.

And after years of hard work, I finally did it. I found a way to reverse the mark, to free people from their shackles and give them back their right to live. And as I shared my discovery with the world, I watched as people started to come together once again.

In the end, the world was a better place. People lived their lives without fear of the mark, without fear of death. And as for me, I retired from my job as a nurse and spent the rest of my days in peace, content in the knowledge that I had done something truly great.
