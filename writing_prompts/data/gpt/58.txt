I used to think having the power to make lies come true was a blessing, but as I stood in front of President John Smith, I realized it was a curse. 

The president, to my surprise, had invited me to the Oval Office to discuss the state of the economy. I had no expertise in the field, but my power had given me an advantage I couldn't resist. As I spoke about the success of the government's recent policies, I noticed the president was looking at me in awe. 

"Mr. President, I can promise you that with these policies, unemployment will decrease, and the economy will prosper," I said confidently, knowing it was a complete lie. 

The president nodded, "I trust you, and your recommendation is noted."

As I left the White House, I couldn't shake off the guilt that came with using my power for personal gain. My lies could have severe consequences, and that was not something I ever wanted to be responsible for. 

A few days later, I received a phone call from the White House. The president had made a few changes to the economic policies as per my recommendation. The changes were having a positive impact, and the economy was improving. 

I was ecstatic, but also petrified that I had set a dangerous precedent. If word got out that the president was taking economic advice from someone with no experience in the field, it could be a huge scandal. 

Weeks passed, and the new policies were working like a charm. Unemployment was decreasing, and the economy was booming. The president was so impressed with my expertise that he made me his economic advisor. I could see the envy in the eyes of those who had spent decades studying economics, but couldn't come up with a solution to the country's financial problems. 

I had power, and I was using it wisely. For the first time in my life, I was making a positive impact in people's lives. However, it was a power that came with a price, and I couldn't shake off the guilt, knowing that my ideas were based on lies and deceit. 

But as I walked into the Oval Office, watching the president take my advice as gospel, I realized something. I may have started with a lie, but what I was doing now was real. The changes I had implemented were genuinely helping people. I had gone from a con artist to a public servant, and that was something worth celebrating. 

I took a deep breath and said, "Mr. President, I have one more recommendation that I believe will take us to the next level." 

He leaned in and listened intently, and as I spoke, I realized that I was no longer lying. The power wasn't in the lies; it was in what I was doing to make the world a better place.
