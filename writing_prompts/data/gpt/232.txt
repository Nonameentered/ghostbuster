You have managed to attach your soul to a item. In which on the event of your death, you will respawn in front of it. The downside to this immortality, is that you keep misplacing it and spawning in weird and sometime uncomfortable places.
I never thought I’d find a way to cheat death, but I’ve managed to do just that. I’ve attached my soul to a simple everyday object, and in the event of my death, I’ll respawn in front of it, ready to start anew. It’s a strange feeling, knowing that I can’t really die, but it’s a reassuring one, too. Or it would be, if I didn’t keep losing the thing I’ve attached myself to.

It’s ridiculous, really. You’d think that something that’s so important to your immortality would be easy to keep track of. But it’s not. On more than one occasion, I’ve found myself respawning in some strange, uncomfortable place, simply because I’ve misplaced the object that I’ve tied myself to.

I remember the first time it happened. I was walking down the street, feeling pretty good about myself and my newfound immortality, when suddenly everything went black. I didn’t know what had happened at first, but then I saw it. My item, the thing that would allow me to respawn, was nowhere to be seen.

I panicked, of course. I thought I was going to be stuck in this weird limbo forever. But then I respawned, in a dark alleyway, surrounded by rats. It wasn’t exactly the spiritual awakening I’d been hoping for.

Since then, I’ve lost my item dozens of times. I’ve woken up in dumpsters, on the side of the road, in public restrooms. It’s been uncomfortable, to say the least. But at least I’m still alive.

I try to take better care of my item now, but it’s not easy. I’m not exactly the most organized person. I’ve lost my keys, my phone, and my wallet more times than I can count, so it’s not surprising that I’ve lost my immortality object, too.

The last time I lost it was the worst, though. I was out camping, enjoying the peace and quiet of the woods, when suddenly I felt a sharp pain in my chest. I knew what it was immediately – I’d been shot. I fell to the ground, my vision blurring, and I desperately searched for my item.

But it was nowhere to be seen. I knew I was going to die, for real this time, and I was terrified. I’d always assumed that I’d respawn in a safe, comfortable place, but now I realized that wasn’t necessarily true. I could wake up in the middle of a war zone, or a burning building, or any number of other terrible places.

I don’t remember much of what happened after that. I know I died, but I don’t remember how it felt or what happened to my soul. All I remember is waking up, cold and alone, in a dark cave. It was the most uncomfortable respawn I’d ever experienced.

I stumbled out of the cave and into the sunlight, and only then did I see my item lying on the ground in front of me. It had somehow fallen out of my pocket during my camping trip, and I’d been without it for who knows how long.

I picked it up, relieved to have it back in my possession. I knew I’d have to be more careful in the future, but for that moment, I was just grateful to be alive.

It’s been a few months since then, and I still misplace my item every now and then. But I’ve gotten better at keeping track of it. I’ve attached it to my keychain, so I always know where it is. And I’ve started carrying a spare just in case.

It’s strange, living forever. I’ve seen so much, experienced so many things that most people can only dream of. But it’s not always easy. Misplacing my item is just one of the many problems that come with immortality.

But for now, I’m alive. And that’s all that really matters.
