You drug someone in a bar, to try to steal their organs... And then discover they have none.
As an organ harvester, I was always on the lookout for the perfect candidate. Someone who was young, healthy, and preferably alone in a bar. That's when I saw my next victim, a young man, not too muscular, but healthy nonetheless. I sat next to him, struck up a conversation, and offered to buy him a drink. A few sips into his beer, I slipped a knockout drug into his glass, and he passed out. I quickly dragged him into an alley and began my work.

As I made my first incision, I realized something wasn't right. There was no sign of any organs. I checked again and again, hoping that I had missed something, but there was nothing there. No heart, no lungs, no liver – nothing. I was confused and scared. I had never seen anything like this before. Was this some sort of genetic mutation? Had he had some sort of surgery that removed his organs? I didn't know what to do. Part of me wanted to leave him there, to let someone else find him. My conscience, however, wouldn't let me. I needed to find out what was going on.

I took him to the hospital, making sure to hide my face and avoid any surveillance cameras. I left him in front of the emergency room and ran away. I didn't want to risk anything – I needed to make sure I was completely anonymous.

Days went by, and I couldn't stop thinking about what had happened. I was afraid that the police would find me, that I would get caught. I had never been so scared in my life. Then one day, I got a call from the hospital. It was the young man. He had woken up and was asking about me. I didn't know what to do. Part of me wanted to ignore the call and never look back. The other part felt guilty – I had drugged him and left him without his organs. This wasn't right.

I decided to go to the hospital and talk to him. When I arrived, I explained what had happened and apologized for what had happened. The young man was surprisingly understanding. Apparently, he was born without any organs due to a rare genetic disorder. His parents had kept it a secret from him, so he didn't know until he woke up in the hospital.

I was shocked. I had never heard of anything like this before. I offered to help him in any way I could, but he refused. He told me that he had come to accept his condition and that he wasn't angry.

I left the hospital feeling a mix of emotions. Relief, guilt, and confusion. I realized that what I had done was wrong – what I had been doing was wrong. I decided to quit my job as an organ harvester, to turn over a new leaf. That day at the hospital was a life-changing experience for me. I couldn't change what I had done, but I could make sure that nothing like it would ever happen again.
