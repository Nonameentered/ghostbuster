Aliens are studying Earth and determine that Humans have 1 God and that that God is a clock.
The aliens arrived on Earth and were fascinated with the species known as humans. They set out to observe and learn more about them. Through their studies, they discovered that humans held a belief system centered around one God.

The aliens were eager to learn more about this divine being, and so they studied human religious texts and spoke to those who practiced faith. What they discovered about the human God surprised them greatly. According to the humans, their God was not a being of flesh and blood but a clock.

Intrigued, the aliens decided to investigate this curious deity further. They observed how humans kept time, and they noticed that clocks were everywhere - on walls, on wrists, even on phones. It seemed that humans were obsessed with this object.

As the aliens delved deeper into the origins of this belief, they uncovered fascinating stories and myths. They learned that humans had been drawn to clocks for thousands of years. They were symbols of order and precision, of progress and efficiency. Humans had even built entire cities and societies around the concept of time.

The aliens were astonished by the impact of this clock God on human civilization. They saw how it had influenced everything from art to science, from economics to politics. And they realized that humans had attributed qualities to this deity that they had never seen ascribed to any God before. It was a God of time, a God of discipline, a God of punctuality.

With this new understanding, the aliens left the planet, marveling at the strange and wonderful ways in which humans worshiped their clock God. They wondered what other secrets and mysteries this species held and vowed to continue their study of humanity.
