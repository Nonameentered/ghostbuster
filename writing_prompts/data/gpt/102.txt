I had always heard of old wives' tales and myths about genies, but I never believed that they actually existed. At least that was until I sparked up my trusted bong and found out that the genie story wasn't just a fantasy. 

It was like a dream; one moment I was lighting the bowl and the next thing I knew, there was a genie standing before me in a cloud of smoke. As I gazed in awe, the genie laughed heartily and said, "At last, you have freed me from this eternal prison. As a token of my gratitude, I am willing to grant you three wishes."

I couldn't believe what was happening. As I tugged on my bong again, I asked the genie, "Are you really real? Like, the actual genie from the stories we've all heard?" 

The genie grinned at me and replied, "Yes, mortal. I'm the one and only genie, and I'm here to grant your wishes as long as you tell me what they are."

With that, I rattled off my first wish, which had been on my mind for months. I wished for a significant amount of money, and with a snap of his fingers, the genie bestowed me with more cash than I had ever seen in my life. 

For my second wish, I asked the genie for the love of my life. I had been single for too long, and I knew that I needed someone special in my life. The genie granted that wish too, and I could feel my heart racing with excitement as I admired the beauty of the woman he conjured for me.

As the smoke from the bong started to clear, I could see the genie slowly fading away. I knew that my time with him was coming to an end, and I had to make my final wish quickly.

But instead of wishing for something materialistic or superficial, I said, "Genie, I just want to thank you for making my dreams come true. You've given me so much, and I'm forever grateful. I wish for your freedom and that you can roam the world as you please just as normal human beings do."

With that, the genie gave me a warm smile and thanked me for using my final wish to set him free. He bowed his head and faded away into the distance, leaving me with overwhelming gratitude and a newfound belief in the power of genies.
