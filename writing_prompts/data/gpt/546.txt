Think of the most ridiculous, funny, or unexpected way to use the phrase, 'Did I mention i'm an expert in explosives?'
Once upon a time, in a small town called Boomville, there lived a man named Tony. Tony was a scientist who had a passion for explosives. He had spent his entire life experimenting with different types of explosive materials and learning everything he could about them.

One day, Tony was invited to give a lecture on explosives at a local high school. He was thrilled to share his knowledge and looked forward to the chance to educate young minds about the fascinating world of explosives.

As he stepped up to the podium, he cleared his throat and began his presentation. He talked about the history of explosives, the different types, how they worked, and how they were used in different industries.

Not long into his speech, Tony realized the students were getting bored. Their eyes were glazing over, and they began fidgeting in their seats. Tony knew he had to do something to grab their attention and make the lecture more exciting.

Suddenly, he had an idea. He looked at the students and said, "Did I mention I'm an expert in explosives?"

The students perked up, intrigued by what he had said. Tony walked to the back of the classroom and pulled out a small box. He set it on the table and opened it up, revealing a bunch of colorful balloons.

"Today, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to blow up some balloons!" he exclaimed.

The students looked at him skeptically, but Tony could see the excitement building in their eyes.

He picked up a balloon and began talking about how it was made of rubber and filled with air. He then explained how explosives work by releasing a large amount of gas quickly, which causes an explosion.

"Now, watch closely," he said. He put a small piece of explosive material inside the balloon and lit a fuse. The students watched as the balloon suddenly expanded, then exploded with a loud bang.

The class erupted in cheers and applause. Tony continued with his demonstration, blowing up balloons of different sizes and colors and setting them off one by one.

When he was finished, the students were on the edge of their seats. Tony could see the awe and wonder in their eyes as they whispered excitedly to each other. They had never seen anything like it before.

As the class ended, the students rushed up to Tony, asking him all sorts of questions about explosives and how he became an expert in them.

Tony smiled and thought to himself, "Did I mention I'm an expert in explosives?"
