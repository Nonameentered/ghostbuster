Due to a crossed line a customer support worker has to deal with a hostage situation. Meanwhile a hostage negotiator has to deal with a disgruntled customer.
As Stephanie answered the phone in the customer support call center, she could hear heavy breathing and muffled voices in the background. She assumed it was a prank call until the caller said something about hostages. Stephanie's heart raced as she realized she was dealing with a real emergency.

Meanwhile, Max, a hostage negotiator, received a call from a disgruntled customer who was upset with their electric bill. Max tried to explain that he wasn't in charge of billing, but the customer wouldn't listen. Max heard commotion in the background and realized there was something more serious going on.

It turned out that a pair of calls had accidentally been crossed, one involving a hostage situation and the other a customer complaint. Stephanie tried to calm down the hostages while Max dealt with the angry customer. Eventually, the mistake was discovered and the calls were transferred to the appropriate departments.

After the chaos had died down, Stephanie and Max met for coffee and shared their surreal experiences. Both were grateful for the training that had prepared them for unexpected situations. They laughed at the absurdity of the situation and were relieved that no one was hurt. They ended up exchanging numbers and becoming good friends, bonding over their wild day at work.
