I woke up in a cold sweat, gasping for air. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it would burst out of my chest. It wasn't until I looked at the room around me that I realized something was amiss. The room was opulent; filled with ornate furniture and artifacts from a bygone era. I slowly sat up and looked down at myself. I was dressed in a stunning gown, one that would have been appropriate for a royal ball. My head was spinning, and I felt like I was going to be sick. 

It wasn't until I walked to the window that I realized the truth of my situation. I was no longer me but had been transported back in time to the body of a highly important historical figure. The clock on the wall read 11:00 pm. I had 24 hours to not change the future. I had to make sure everything happened exactly as it was supposed to so that the timeline would remain unchanged. 

The day was a blur of meetings and conference calls, and I struggled to keep up as I was being asked about things I had never heard of before. My brain felt like it was on overload, but I was determined to stick to my mission. 

As the sun began to set, I had a sense that something was about to happen. It felt like the universe was holding its breath, waiting for something to change. I knew that I couldn't let that happen. 

The room was silent as I stepped out onto the balcony, the chilly breeze playing with the fabric of my dress. It was only a few minutes until my aide walked up to me, standing next to me without saying anything.

Suddenly, it happened. A carriage approached the palace quickly, and I knew that it was not supposed to be there. I had to act fast, but not too fast that people would notice anything. I excused myself from the balcony, inconspicuously snuck out, and quickly got into a guard's uniform, grabbed a sword, and made my way to the stables where I was able to thwart the attack on the visiting diplomat without anyone suspecting anything. 

I knew that I had succeeded in my task when I arrived safely back in my own body, in my own time. It had been a wild ride, but I had succeeded, and the timeline remained unchanged. Perhaps it was best that I never knew what would have happened if the timeline had been altered forever.
