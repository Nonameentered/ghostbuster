I woke up to the sound of my alarm clock ringing. It was 7am and time for me to start my day. I got out of bed, brushed my teeth and took a quick shower. I knew that I had to be at work by 9am. I quickly made myself a cup of coffee and grabbed a piece of toast before heading out.

The commute to work was rather uneventful but I didn't mind it. It gave me some time to read my book and listen to some music. Once I got to the office, I greeted my colleagues and started working on my tasks for the day. The day went by in a blur and before I knew it, it was time to head home. 

I got back to my apartment, took off my shoes and sat down on the couch. I turned on the TV and watched some of my favorite shows. I quickly made myself dinner, which was just a simple pasta dish. After dinner, I decided to do some cleaning. I dusted the shelves, cleaned the bathroom and vacuumed the floors.

As I was about to head to bed, I realized that I had forgotten to call my sister. I picked up my phone and dialed her number. As we chatted, I couldn't help but feel thankful for all the normalcy in my life. I had a routine that gave me comfort and stability.

Suddenly, I heard a loud noise coming from outside. I quickly ended the call with my sister and went to the window to see what it was. What I saw next made my heart stop. I saw something in the sky that I couldn't explain. It was a giant spaceship hovering above the city. I couldn't believe my eyes, but it was undeniable. The last line of my normal day had now become anything but.
