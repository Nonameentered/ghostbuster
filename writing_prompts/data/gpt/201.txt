As a child, Kayla was always fascinated by the words written on her body. Her parents had explained to her that every person was born with the last words that their soulmate would say to them. Kayla felt it was romantic, like a permanent love letter etched onto her skin.

Growing up, Kayla had always dreamed of the day she would meet her soulmate and find out the meaning behind the words on her body. As she got older, the anticipation grew stronger, until finally, she met him.

The first time she saw him, she felt as though she had struck gold. He was charming, handsome, and everything she had ever wanted. They fell in love quickly and deeply, sharing everything with each other. But something always felt off, like he was holding something back.

Years passed, and they were still together, but the feeling never left. Kayla couldn't take it anymore and finally asked him what was wrong.

"I never loved you," he said firmly.

Kayla felt as if her entire world had shattered around her. The words she had carried with her her entire life were finally revealed, but they had brought nothing but pain and heartbreak.

Kayla realized then that sometimes, the words on your body aren't meant to be a love letter. Sometimes, they're just a warning, a reminder that not all love stories have a happy ending.
