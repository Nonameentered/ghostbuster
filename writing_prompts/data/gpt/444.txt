Mary had always lived in a world where every person had a number floating over their head. It was a bizarre but accepted part of life. The numbers indicated how many people on earth had numbers over their head. As long as Mary could remember, her number had been high, in the millions. She had never paid much attention to it until one day she glanced in the mirror and saw that her number was backwards.

Panic set in as she realized the implications. Maryâ€™s number was now negative, indicating that there were fewer people on earth who had numbers over their heads than the population. Everyone around her seemed to look at her quizzically. No one knew what to make of her reversed number.

Mary was baffled and disoriented. She had no idea what this meant for her or the world. All she knew was that something bizarre had happened, and she was the only one affected by it.
