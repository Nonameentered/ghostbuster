I was always the best in the business. My reputation as a master assassin preceded me wherever I went. And why not? I had never failed to carry out my duties, no matter how dangerous or difficult the task was.

But in recent times, my work had taken a drastic turn. Gone were the days of taking out political rebels or drug lords. Now, it was all about population control.

The medical technology had become too good, and people were living too long. The never-ending pensions were bankrupting the country, and the government had come up with a novel solution - hire assassins like me to help ease the burden on the economy.

I didn't care for the moral implications of what I was doing. All I cared about was the thrill of the hunt and the sweet scent of money. After all, everyone had a price, and mine was sky-high.

My latest assignment was to take down a 78-year-old man who had been living off the pension for over a decade. The bloke was in good shape, thanks to the advancements in medical technology. But it was high time he made his exit, in the guise of an accident.

I followed him for a few days, scoping out the best possible location for the hit. Finally, I found my spot - a deserted alleyway with no CCTV cameras or witnesses.

The old man had a regular schedule of going for a walk every evening, and today was no different. He walked into the alleyway, and I made my move.

I had planned on something quick and painless - a shot to the head with a silenced gun. But something held me back. Maybe it was the look in his eyes, or maybe it was my conscience finally raising its voice. Whatever it was, I knew I couldn't take him out in cold blood.

Instead, I decided to stage an accident. I approached him from behind, making sure he didn't hear me. Then, I kicked him hard, sending him flying into a pile of trash.

The old man let out a scream of surprise and pain as he hit the ground. I stood there, watching him writhing in agony, my heart pounding in my chest. But it was too late to back off now. I had to make it look convincing.

I called for an ambulance and acted like a concerned citizen until they arrived. Once they took the old man away, I melted into the darkness and disappeared into the night.

The next day, I heard the news that the old man had succumbed to his injuries. It was all over the front page - a tragic accident that had claimed the life of an innocent pensioner.

For the world, it was just another sad tale of an old man's death. But for me, it was a weight that I would carry for the rest of my life.

I couldn't keep doing this. It was one thing to take down criminals, but the thought of killing the elderly to save the economy was something I couldn't stomach.

I knew I couldn't leave the job without putting myself in danger, so I decided to go about it differently. I started taking out the government officials who had authorized these assignments. One by one, I eliminated them, till no one was left to give me orders.

It was a risky move, but I had to do it. For the first time in a long time, I felt free - free of the weight of my conscience and the guilt of what I had done.

I knew the government would come after me, but I didn't care. I would take them down one by one, till I had wiped the slate clean.

Medical technology had become too good, people were living too long, and the never-ending pensions were bankrupting the country. But I had found a way to fight back, in the only way I knew how - with a gun and a conscience.
