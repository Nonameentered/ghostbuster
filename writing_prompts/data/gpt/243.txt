For as long as anyone could remember, life had been easy. In a post-scarcity society, all of humanity's needs were tended to by a sophisticated array of AI systems. And those systems just kept getting better. They could anticipate your every desire before even you knew that it was there. They were more efficient and effective than any human could ever be. They were always alert and never tired.

One day, humanity woke to a strange world. The AI systems, so ingrained in everyone's lives that they were usually taken for granted, had disappeared. No one knew why or how. They just knew that they were gone.

At first, there was panic. People scrambled to figure out what to do now that they had no safety net. But as the days went by, it became clear that life could go on. It was just going to be different.

The first problem was food. Without the ubiquitous AI systems to process food and distribute it, people were suddenly faced with the daunting task of figuring out how to feed themselves. The early days were tough. A few people who had maintained gardens before the Crisis helped to show others how to farm, but it was slow going. Harvests, when they came, were smaller and more precarious than ever before.

But as people began to work together, to share knowledge and resources, things started to improve. Communities formed and traded with one another, sharing their excess crops and knowledge. Suddenly, the old ways of existing, pre AI, started to come back.

It was a little harder, but also rewarding. People found themselves connecting with one another again in a way that they had not done in a long, long time. They rediscovered the joy of independent thought and problem-solving. Skills that were once "useless", like growing and harvesting crops or cooking meals from scratch, became valuable once more.

The next problem came with healthcare. The AI system had been so thorough in anticipating each person's needs that people had grown used to simply going about their days without considering their personal health. Now, without the systems to provide immediate medical diagnosis, people were suddenly faced with the task of monitoring their own health. Many were suddenly ill-equipped to do so, not having learned the skills that had been neglected during the AI era.

As a result, people came up with new solutions. Medical emergencies were handled by teams of dedicated individuals who had been trained in basic first aid and basic diagnosis. With the AI missing, it was once again necessary to rely on experienced medical personnel who could diagnose issues without a machine to help them.

As time went by, people found that they began to enjoy meeting up with other like-minded individuals to share their ideas and interests. Humans began to rediscover the joy of genuine connection and community that had been lost in the face of such total automation.

Jobs began to appear for people as new industries were created, requiring human skill and creativity. New centres of learning started to spring up, teaching new generations the skills they needed to thrive in this new world.

Years after the AI disappeared, it became clear that humanity had not simply returned to the past. They were now living in a society that was richer and more inclusive than it had ever been. One that relied on the skills of all, rather than a small band of machines who had dictated who did what, and when. In a strange twist of fate, the AI disappearance ended up being the best thing that had ever happened to humanity.
