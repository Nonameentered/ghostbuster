The 'dislike' button on YouTube videos is replaced with a 'electrocute uploader' button.
It was just a regular day for Jane. She had nothing to do, so she decided to go on YouTube and watch some videos. Jane was scrolling through the content when she came across a video that she did not like. She hovered the mouse over the dislike button when suddenly, it changed to an electrocute uploader button! She thought it was a glitch of some kind and tried refreshing the page, but to her horror, the button remained unchanged.

Jane continued to browse through the videos when she saw a few videos where the button had already been pressed. She clicked on one of the videos to see what would happen and was shocked to see the uploader jump and scream as if they had been electrocuted. She realized that the button was no longer just a 'dislike' button but a tool used to electrocute the uploader.

Jane was dumbfounded and could not wrap her head around what was happening. She thought it might have been a hack or a prank, but the button remained on every video she clicked. It was spreading like wildfire; videos with a large number of dislikes had a higher number of electrocutes. It was as though the entire world had gone mad.

The media caught wind of the new button, and outrage followed. People were demanding that the button be removed immediately. The social media giants were in a state of panic, unable to comprehend how the button appeared on their platforms. It was chaos, and no one knew what to do about it.

As the days went on, it became evident that the button was here to stay. The world had become so obsessed with negativity that the electrocute button had become the new way of expressing displeasure. The tool was not just limited to videos anymore; it had spread to other social media sites as well.

Jane was horrified by what had happened. She wanted to do something to stop this madness but felt helpless. She decided to start a campaign to ask people to stop using the button. Her message was loud and clear, "The electrocute button is not an expression of displeasure; itâ€™s a tool to hurt others."

The campaign gained popularity quickly, and people started to listen. The media picked up on Jane's message, and soon, the electrocute button lost its appeal. People began to understand that the button was just a tool for hurting others and not a way to express their displeasure. The button was soon removed from all platforms, and the world slowly returned to normal.

Jane was happy that her campaign had been successful. People could now focus on the positives rather than the negatives. The world had learned an important lesson, how negativity can lead to disastrous consequences, and that kindness and positivity should always be the way forward.
