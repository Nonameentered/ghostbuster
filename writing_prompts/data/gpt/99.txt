Writing challenge: Write a character who devolves into madness, and narrate his mind. The challenge? His mind has to be completely rational and understandable.
Henry had always been an analytical person. He was the type to analyze every decision he made, weigh the pros and cons, and make a rational choice. That was until everything changed.

It started with a breakup. His girlfriend of six years had left him for another man. At first, he was devastated. But soon, his rational mind started to take over. He began to analyze every detail, every conversation, every argument they had ever had. He became obsessed with finding out what had gone wrong.

Days turned into weeks, and Henry's mind became consumed with thoughts of his ex-girlfriend. He began to see her everywhere he went, even though he knew it was impossible. He would hear her voice in his head, criticizing every move he made.

His sleep patterns began to change too. He would stay up late at night, pouring over old pictures and text messages. He began talking to himself, asking himself why she had left him.

Then things got worse. Henry's rational mind slowly became irrational. He started hearing voices, telling him to do crazy things. He tried to fight the voices, but they were too strong. They would scream at him, telling him his ex-girlfriend was cheating on him with his own brother.

Henry knew this wasn't true, but his mind had become so consumed with these voices that he started to believe them. He became paranoid, convinced that everyone was against him.

One day, Henry snapped. He had packed a bag and was about to leave his house when he saw an image of his ex-girlfriend standing in front of him. He couldn't take it anymore. He screamed at her, begging her to come back to him. But when she didn't, he turned on himself.

He started hitting himself, over and over again until his rational mind finally snapped completely. He was no longer able to analyze the situation, no longer able to think clearly. Henry had devolved into madness and there was no turning back.
