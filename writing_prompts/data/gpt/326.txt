For centuries, humans had always wondered if they were the only sentient species in the galaxy. They had built futuristic telescopes, sent out probes and established communication systems in the hopes of finding signs of alien life. However, when they finally made contact with an extraterrestrial race, their expectations were quickly shattered. 

Turns out, humans were not only not alone in the universe, but also the most violent and war-geared species out there. The aliens they met had evolved to be peaceful and harmonious, with little to no history of warfare. They were in awe and horror as they learned about the countless wars and conflicts that humanity had waged throughout history. 

But despite this, the aliens remained friendly and curious about humans. They started to exchange knowledge, showing them technologies they had never seen before. And then, they presented them with a strange request. 

"We need your help," the alien representative said. "There's a planet in a nearby system that is being threatened by a hostile species. They want to invade and take over, and we have reason to believe that they have something the other species wants."

"What is it?" asked the human representative.

"Oil," the alien replied. "They use it as fuel for their ships and machines, and they're willing to do anything to get their hands on it. We fear that if they succeed in taking over the planet, they will not only harm its inhabitants but also threaten our own species in the long run."

The human representative was taken aback. On one hand, they were shocked to learn that there were species in the galaxy that still relied on oil as a resource. On the other hand, they were intrigued by the prospect of being asked to help in an intergalactic conflict. 

"What can we do?" he asked.

"We can provide you with technology and weapons," the alien said. "We have been observing your society since our first contact, and we know that you humans have a certain knack for violence and warfare. We want to offer you a chance to use that skill for a good cause."

The human representative hesitated. On one hand, he felt a sense of duty to help protect the innocent inhabitants of the planet being invaded. On the other hand, he knew that getting involved in an intergalactic war had countless potential ramifications. 

But then he remembered all the times in human history when they had stood by and watched as atrocities were carried out. All the times when they had the power and ability to help but chose not to. He knew that if they turned down this request, they would be no better than the cowards of the past. 

"Let's do it," he said. 

And with that, the alien representatives began to provide the humans with a wealth of advanced technology. From laser guns to fighter ships, the humans were armed to the teeth with weaponry unlike anything they had ever seen. They knew they had a significant advantage over the other species, and they were determined to use it to win the conflict. 

They travelled to the planet in question, and the humans quickly took charge of the armies. They began to strategize and plan out an attack. They knew that their enemy had been relying on a ground invasion, so they decided to take to the skies. They launched their ships and launched a fierce aerial bombardment, using their advanced weapons to wipe out any enemy ships they came across. 

They soon touched down on the planet's surface, and the fighting began in earnest. It was a massive battle, with tanks and troops exchanging fire in a vicious firefight. The humans were amazed at how effective their weapons were, how easily they were able to dispatch their foes with a single shot. 

But as the hours wore on, they began to see the true cost of war. They saw the innocent lives lost, the collateral damage done to the planet. They saw the vast expanses of oil fields that the aliens had been fighting for, and they knew that this conflict had been fueled by greed and desperation. 

The humans ultimately emerged victorious, but they knew that it had come at a great cost. They had seen firsthand the horrors of warfare, the terrible toll it could take on a society. And they knew that they had been no different from the species they had helped to defeat. 

As they prepared to leave the planet and return to their own, the human representatives met once more with the aliens. 

"We did it," he said. "But at what cost? And what does this mean for our species moving forward?"

The alien representative nodded. "You have learned a valuable lesson. But I believe that it means you have the potential to change. You can use your violent nature to fight for a noble cause, to protect the innocent and preserve life. It's up to you to decide how you want to move forward."

And with that, the two species parted ways, both richer in understanding of their own natures and the universe around them. 

The humans had learned the value of their own power and the consequences of its use. They knew that they had been given technology and reason to fight for something greater than themselves, and they hoped that they could use that newfound wisdom to continue to grow and evolve as a species.
