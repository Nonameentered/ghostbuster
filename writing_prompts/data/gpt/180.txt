Sci-Fi Realism is a new genre that focuses on the mundane, slice-of-life, everyday aspects that will exist in the coming years, far removed from the high-emotion drama of cyberpunk or space operas. With that in mind, write a story set in the future, but reads like a contemporary work!
In the year 2045, living on the moon had become a normal part of life for the people who had migrated there. Gone were the days when space travel was filled with thrill and excitement. Nowadays, it was just another way of transportation for people who wanted to visit their loved ones on Earth or attend business meetings.

Avery was one of the people who lived on the moon. She worked at the oxygen plant that supplied air to the city and spent most of her days inside the plant. It was a monotonous job, but she enjoyed the fact that she was contributing to the well-being of the people who lived there.

One day, as she was walking to her workplace, she noticed a group of people huddled around a man lying on the ground. She approached the group and saw that the man was unconscious.

Avery realized that something was wrong with the oxygen supply. She quickly checked the readings on her tablet, trying to find the source of the problem. She soon realized that a part of the oxygen generator was malfunctioning and needed to be replaced.

She quickly called the maintenance team and they arrived in a matter of minutes. They replaced the faulty part and the oxygen supply was restored. The man on the ground regained consciousness and was rushed to the medical center for further treatment.

Avery went back to work, feeling grateful that she had been able to help. It was such a small, ordinary incident, but it was an example of the kind of mundane tasks that made up her daily routine.

The rest of the day went by without any other incidents. Avery finished her shift and headed back to her apartment. As she was walking, she noticed that the walls of some of the buildings were starting to crack. She knew that it was the result of the increased seismic activity that had been occurring on the moon for the past few months.

She made a mental note to inform the authorities and went to her apartment. She spent the rest of the evening watching TV and scrolling through social media, like any other day.

The next morning, Avery woke up to the sound of an alarm. She quickly got dressed and headed out, as did all the other residents in the building. They had been trained for this – it was a routine drill that was conducted once a month.

As she was standing outside, waiting for the all-clear, she saw a group of children playing nearby. They were using a holographic ball and laughing loudly.

Avery smiled – it was moments like these that made her feel like her life was normal. But as she looked up at the sky, she was reminded of the reality of her situation.

The moon was a harsh, unforgiving place. The people who lived there had to work hard every day just to survive. The constant dangers, whether it was faulty equipment or natural disasters, made life on the moon anything but mundane.

Yet, despite all of this, Avery and the people who lived on the moon had found a way to make their lives as normal as possible. They had created a community that supported each other, that laughed and played, that worried about the same everyday things that people on Earth did.

For Avery, that was enough. She didn't need the drama of space operas or the thrill of cyberpunk novels to feel alive. The small moments, the quiet achievements, and the simple joys of everyday life were enough for her.

Sci-Fi Realism may have been a new genre, but for Avery and the people of the moon, it was just another day.
