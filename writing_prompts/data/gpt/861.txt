Create a story- in third person- about your motivation to write.
Once upon a time, there was a young girl who had always loved to read. As she grew older, she found herself more and more drawn to the world of literature and writing. She would often find herself lost in daydreams, imagining herself as the protagonist of her own epic tale.

However, despite her passion, she struggled to find the motivation to write. Life was busy, and there always seemed to be something more important to do. But she refused to give up on her dream.

One day, she stumbled upon a quote by Stephen King that changed everything for her: “The scariest moment is always just before you start. After that, things can only get better.” These words resonated with her deeply, and she decided then and there to take a chance and start writing.

As she delved deeper into her writing journey, she found that each word she wrote gave her a sense of fulfillment that she couldn’t find anywhere else. She felt alive, as if everything suddenly made sense. The more she wrote, the more she found that her stories had the power to inspire and move others.

Eventually, she realized that her motivation came not from external factors but from within herself. She wrote not for fame or success, but because it was a part of who she was. And as long as she stayed true to that, there was nothing that could stop her from achieving her dreams.
