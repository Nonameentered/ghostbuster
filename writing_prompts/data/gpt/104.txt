Today was a typical day in my marriage to Captain Obvious. As soon as we woke up, he pointed out the obvious fact that we were in our bedroom and that it was morning. I acknowledged his observation with a smile and got ready for the day.

As we sat down for breakfast, Captain Obvious noted that we were eating food. He also pointed out that the cereal was crunchy and the milk was cold. I rolled my eyes playfully and we continued our meal.

Later in the day, we went for a walk in the park. Captain Obvious couldn't help but comment on the fact that we were outside and that there were trees and birds around us. He even pointed out a duck swimming in the pond, as if I had never seen one before.

When we got back home, Captain Obvious reminded me that he loved me and that he was grateful for our marriage. I smiled and hugged him, knowing that while his observations may seem trivial, they were his way of expressing his love and appreciation for all the little things in life.

As we settled in for the night, Captain Obvious mentioned that it was dark outside and that it was time for bed. I chuckled and kissed him, grateful for the simplicity and honesty that he brought to our marriage.

Sometimes Captain Obvious could be a bit much, but I knew that he always had a good heart. He may state the obvious, but he also showed me how to appreciate the small things in life that I may have otherwise overlooked. I wouldn't trade our marriage for anything, even if he did point out the obvious every once in a while.
