In the future we are able to scan through our GPS history to see where we have intersected with people we are 'meeting' for the first time. You spot a cute girl in a bar and do a quick GPS intersection scan to discover she's been within 50 feet of you for every one of your life's disasters.
It was a Friday evening, and I had just finished work. I decided to unwind by going to a bar that I had always wanted to try. It was here that I saw her. She was sitting alone at a table, lost in thought, almost as though she didn't notice the rest of the world around her.

I was drawn to her, and I knew I had to talk to her. But as I approached her, something inside me told me to do a quick GPS intersection scan. I was curious to see if our paths had ever crossed in the past. I took out my phone and quickly ran the scan.

I was shocked when I saw the results. For every one of my life's disasters, this girl had been within 50 feet of me. From the car accident that nearly took my life to the burglary that left me without my valuables, she had somehow managed to be in the same vicinity as me.

I couldn't believe it. How was it possible that I had never met this girl before, and yet she had been present for every negative moment in my life? I knew I had to talk to her, and find out if there was any meaning behind this strange coincidence.

"Hi there," I said, approaching her. "Is this seat taken?"

She looked up and smiled at me. "No, feel free to sit down."

We started talking, and I soon found out that her name was Sarah. She was a waitress, working her way through college, trying to make ends meet. She was kind, intelligent, and had a great sense of humor. The more I talked to her, the more I realized that there was something special about her.

"So, Sarah," I said cautiously after a while. "I did this GPS intersection scan, and something strange came up. It seems that you have been present for every negative moment in my life."

Sarah raised an eyebrow. "Really? How so?"

I explained to her about the scan and how she had been within 50 feet of me during every one of my life's disasters. Sarah was amazed, and we spent the next few hours talking about our lives and all the strange coincidences that had led us to this moment.

As the night wore on, I realized that I had fallen in love with her. Sarah was the missing piece in my life that I never knew I needed. We exchanged numbers, and over the next few weeks, we started dating.

It was then that I realized that Sarah was the reason why I had never met her before. She had always been in my life, but I had never noticed her. It was as though the universe had been trying to bring us together all this time, and I had finally opened my eyes to see it.

As we got more serious, I couldn't help but ask Sarah if she had done the same GPS intersection scan. I was curious to see if she had been present for any of my positive moments, and what that would mean for us.

"Yes, I did the scan," Sarah said, smiling at me. "And I'm happy to say that I have been there for every single one of your happy moments as well."

She showed me the results, and it was true. Sarah had been there for every job promotion, every successful project, and every moment of joy in my life.

It was then that I knew that Sarah was the one for me. She had been there for me when I needed her most, and had shared my joys and triumphs as well. We got married a year later, and I knew that I would never be alone again.

As I scanned through our GPS history, I realized that our intersection points had only increased over time. Sarah had become a permanent part of my life, and I knew that she always would be.

In the future, we would continue to use technology to find each other and connect. But for me, the most important connection had been made long before I even knew it. Sarah was my destiny, and I was grateful for every second that I got to spend with her.
