Overnight, the world changed. 90% of the population was dead. The streets were littered with empty cars and abandoned buildings. Those who did survive found themselves among diverse groups. Different countries, different ethnicities, different beliefs, and different lifestyles. But, they all had one thing in common.

At first, it seemed like a coincidence. They all had a mark on the bottom of their feet. But as time passed, they realized that it was more than just a physical similarity. They all had the ability to communicate telepathically.

It was strange at first. Hearing other people's thoughts in your head could be overwhelming. But as they learned to control their abilities, the survivors began to see the benefits. They could strategize together, read each other's minds for information, and even send messages without speaking out loud.

They started to build communities, helping each other to rebuild what was lost. They shared knowledge and skills, creating a society that was more connected than ever before.

It was a strange new world, but they adapted. They were no longer divided by their differences, but connected by their shared trait. And as they worked together to rebuild their world, they knew that they had a unique advantage that would help them move forward.
