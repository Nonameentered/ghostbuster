One morning, you wake up and suddenly find yourself three years in the past, as if the last three years had never happened. It happened to the entire world and everyone remembers.
I woke up and sat up in bed looking around my room. Everything looked different, the wallpaper, the carpet, the bed sheets. It was like I was in a different room, but I knew it was mine. It was then that I noticed something odd. My alarm clock was the same one I had in college.

I got out of bed and looked out the window. The view outside was different too. The houses across the street had different colors, and my neighbor's car was a different model. I rubbed my eyes and pinched myself to make sure I wasn't dreaming. But no, it was real.

I hurried to my phone to see the date. It read June 13, 2018. That's when I realized what had happened. It was like the last three years of my life had vanished. I was back in time, somehow.

I went downstairs and my parents were in the kitchen making breakfast. They looked the same, but I felt like I was seeing them for the first time in years. They were surprised to see me awake so early and asked if I was feeling okay. I told them I was fine and sat down to eat.

As we sat at the table eating breakfast, my parents noticed how quiet I was. They tried to make conversation, but I couldn't focus on anything they were saying. My mind was swirling with thoughts about how I could have lost three whole years of my life.

After breakfast, I decided to go to my room and check my computer. I was hoping to find some clue about what had happened. When I turned it on, I found that everything had been restored to the state it was in three years ago. All my files, pictures, and applications were missing.

Panicking, I opened my browser and checked the news. It was then that I found out that it wasn't just me. Everyone in the world had gone back three years in time as if the last three years had never happened.

People were freaking out everywhere. Governments were holding emergency meetings, and the news channels were flooded with reports of people wandering the streets in disbelief. Scientists were trying to find out what had caused this strange phenomenon, but no one had an answer.

As I sat in front of my computer, I started to get anxious about my life. All the work I had done over the last three years had been for nothing. What would I do now? Would I lose my job? My friends and family would be confused, and I didn't know how to explain everything that had happened.

That's when I realized that I had been given a second chance, something that no one else had. I would be able to change things in my life that I had always wished were different. I would be able to fix my mistakes and make better choices.

Since I had gone back in time, I decided to make the most out of it. I made a list of all the things I wanted to change in my life, the things that I wished I had done differently. And then one by one, I started working on those things.

I started to exercise, eat healthier, and read more books. I started to learn new skills and to travel more. I made an effort to reach out to old friends and make new ones. I worked harder at my job and found new ways to improve my work.

I also faced some of my fears and conflicts which I had always postponed. I went and had difficult conversations with people I had lost touch with or who I had conflicts with. This helped me clear the air and fix broken relationships. 

As I kept making changes, I started to see the benefits in my life. I felt healthier, happier, and more fulfilled. I also felt more in control of my life, as I had consciously made choices that aligned with my values and goals.

Three years later, on June 13th, 2021, I woke up to find that everything had changed again. This time, I was back to where I was three years ago. It was like returning to the same point when it all began. But this time, I felt more prepared. I knew what I wanted and how I could get there. 

As I went through my day, I felt a sense of nostalgia mixed with excitement. I saw the world in a new light, appreciating the changes I had made and being grateful for the experiences that had led me to that point. 

Looking back, I realized how one single moment of disorientation had led to such a transformative experience. Going back in time had given me a second chance, the chance to live life on my own terms. And I was determined to make the most of it.
