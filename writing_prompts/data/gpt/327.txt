You are the son of a prolific serial killer who uses you as bait to lure his victims. You finally decide to retaliate.
Growing up as the son of a prolific serial killer was anything but ordinary. My father was like a shadow in the night, always on the prowl for his next victim. He would come home reeking of blood with a sense of satisfaction in his eyes. And as horrifying as it may sound, I grew up accustomed to it all. I was his accomplice, his bait to lure his victims into his grasp.

I was still a young boy when my father started grooming me. It was like playing a sick game of hide-and-seek, except there was no "safe spot." My job was to lead strangers to my father's lair, where he would strike them down. He would always tell me that by working together, we would create chaos and fear. At first, I was reluctant, but then he would remind me of our bond as father and son. He would plead with me not to betray him.

But as I grew older, my mind became clouded with doubts. I started thinking about the families of his victims, the ones that would never see their loved ones again. I started feeling responsible for every life that was taken. How could I have lived with myself while I was being used as a tool for unspeakable crimes?

I tried to keep my head down and avoid attracting my father's attention, but then one day, he made a grievous mistake of bringing me along on a hunt. We drove to a deserted area and parked the car. I sat in the passenger seat, pretending to be lost in my thoughts. As we waited in silence, I saw a woman walking alone on the road. My father gestured at me to follow him, and I slowly trailed him in the darkness.

But something inside me snapped. I could no longer bear the burden of what I was about to do. It was as if my conscience was warring with itself. A voice in my head was telling me to stop, to break free from this cycle of death. I could not bring myself to lead that woman to my father. When he saw me hesitate, he turned around and saw what I was doing.

He was angry, and I could see the betrayal in his eyes. He lunged towards me, but I was too quick for him. I dodged his attack and ran into the woods. I could hear him shouting my name and cursing me for my actions. But I knew this was the right thing to do. And so, I ran as fast as I could until I was far away from him.

As I caught my breath, I realized that I had broken free from my father's grip for the first time in many years. It was like waking up from a nightmare. I vowed to make things right, to put an end to his senseless killing spree. I knew it would not be easy, but I was determined to take him down.

I went to the authorities and told them everything. They were skeptical at first, but as I recounted the horrors I had witnessed, they started to believe me. They arrested my father, and he was taken to trial. He tried to defend himself by claiming insanity, but it was no use. The evidence was against him, and he was eventually sentenced to life in prison.

Although justice was served, I still carry the guilt of being the son of a murderer. But I am determined to use my experience to make the world a better place. I am now an advocate for victims' rights, and I use my story to raise awareness about the dangers of domestic abuse and child manipulation. I know that I can never erase my past, but I can make a difference in the future.
