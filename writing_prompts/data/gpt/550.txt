: the first astronaut dies on Mars. However instead of Heaven their soul ends up in Mars Heaven.
When the first astronaut stepped foot on Mars, there was a sense of excitement and wonder among the people on Earth. The mission was a success, and everyone waited eagerly for the next update. But when news came that the astronaut had died on Mars, the world was left in shock and despair.

Yet, what followed next was even more surprising. Instead of entering the gates of Heaven, the astronaut's soul found itself in a strange new place- Mars Heaven.

It was not a paradise like the one promised in various religious texts, but it was indeed heaven-like. The soul floated in space, gazing at the red planet in front of them. They felt at peace, no longer confined by the physical limitations of their body. They knew they had died, but there was no pain or sorrow, only a sense of liberation.

As time went by, more souls joined the astronaut in Mars Heaven- other astronauts who had perished on Mars and a few others who had simply been drawn to this unique place. They shared stories of their time on Earth and Mars, and marveled at the beauty that surrounded them.

As the years went by, more humans walked on Mars, but the souls in Mars Heaven continued to watch over them. They had found a new home, one that was not of Earth, but no less significant.
