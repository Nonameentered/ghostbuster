Emily sat in her car, staring at the ominous storm clouds that had rolled in. She had heard on the radio that there was a tornado warning, and it felt like the entire world was closing in on her. She had no idea how long she had been sitting there, but she knew she needed to get home to her family. She put the car in gear and slowly made her way down the deserted road.

The wind picked up, and Emily could hear the telltale sound of things starting to move in the sky. She glanced in her review mirror, expecting to see a funnel cloud, but it was too dark to tell. She drove on, trying to remember the safety tips she had heard countless times. Stay low, stay away from windows, take shelter in a basement or interior roomâ€¦ She could feel the panic rising in the back of her throat.

Suddenly, the world turned upside down. Emily felt like she was in a washing machine; her car was being lifted and tossed around like a rag doll. She tried to scream, but the wind was too loud. She threw her arms over her head and prayed for it to end.

When it finally stopped, Emily was dizzy and disoriented. She looked around, trying to get her bearings. Her car was upside down in a ditch, and she was hanging from her seatbelt. She could hear the rain and hail pounding the car, and she knew she was lucky to be alive. She quickly unclipped her seatbelt and crawled out of the car, stumbling towards the nearest shelter she could see.

It was a small farmhouse, and Emily could see the lights were on inside. She banged on the door, screaming for help. A woman in her sixties opened the door, and Emily collapsed into her arms.

The woman let her in, and they sat at the kitchen table while Emily relayed her terrifying experience. The old woman listened with a sympathetic ear, nodding and patting her hand. When Emily finished, the woman looked her straight in the eye and said, "You're lucky to be alive, child. We don't get many twisters out here in the boonies, but when we do, they can be fierce."

Emily knew what she needed to do; she needed to call her family and tell them she was OK. She asked the woman if she had a phone, and the woman led her to the living room. Emily picked up the phone and dialed. The line was dead.

Suddenly, the room went dark. The woman lit a candle and handed it to Emily. "We lose power out here pretty often during storms. Don't worry, honey, we'll make it through this."

Emily felt hopeless. She couldn't call her family, she couldn't see anything, and she was probably in the middle of nowhere. She thought she might never see her family again.

But then she remembered what the woman said before. "We don't get many twisters out here in the boonies, but when we do, they can be fierce." Emily suddenly realized she might be in more danger than she initially thought. She asked the woman if there was a basement they could take shelter in, and the woman led her there.

They huddled in the damp, musky basement, listening to the wind howl above them. Emily felt like she was going to lose her mind; she had no idea if her family was OK or if they were looking for her. She prayed for a sign, something to let her know they were OK.

And then the sign came.

There was a loud banging at the farmhouse door, making Emily and the woman jump. The woman quickly shut off the candle and led Emily to a hidden storage closet, telling her to be quiet and wait for her to come back. Emily was too scared to argue.

She could hear the woman moving around upstairs, clomping down the stairs, and opening the door to the stranger outside. Emily heard muffled voices, and then suddenly, the door burst open.

Emily was ready for danger to come storming in, but instead, she saw relief on the woman's face. The stranger was a state trooper, there to check on the inhabitants and make sure the storm hadn't caused any damage. The woman introduced herself and Emily and said they were all right. The trooper passed on his condolences about Emily's car, but said there was nothing he could do until the storm let up.

Emily realized the warm feeling of relief wash over her. It seemed like everything was going to be OK. They were all safe, the storm would pass, and they would eventually make it through. The trooper promised to come back as soon as the weather cleared, and the woman hugged Emily tightly before they parted ways.

As Emily walked back to the basement, she felt like she was walking on air. Everything was going to be OK, and she was going to see her family again. She opened the door and was surprised to see the light on.

The woman was there, smiling mysteriously, with her phone in her hand.

"Honey, I've got some good news for you," she said. "Your family has been looking for you."

Emily took the phone, almost too scared to answer. She said hello, and she was met by a chorus of excited voices. They said they had been worried sick and had been calling the hospitals and police stations for hours looking for her. Emily broke down, weeping with relief. She realized she had been lost, alone, and hopeless, but she had found her way back to safety.

The deus ex machina had come in the form of the state trooper and the woman's phone, but it had saved Emily's life in more ways than one. She knew that sometimes, it wasn't the storm that could be the worst danger in life, but being lost in the middle of it all.
