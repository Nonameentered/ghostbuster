America was colonised by Spain, not Britain
In the early 16th century, the Spanish expedition led by Hernan Cortes discovered and conquered the land of Mexico. The vast wealth of gold and other resources were brought back to Spain, which greatly enriched the Spanish empire and its kings. The Spanish colonization of the Americas continued throughout the century, with explorers such as Francisco Pizarro and Pedro de Valdivia claiming vast territories of South America in the name of Spain.

In this alternative history, the Spanish colonization of the Americas continued well into North America, with some key changes to the historical timeline. One of the most significant was the decision of King Phillip II to prioritize the colonization of the eastern seaboard of America over the Philippines and other Asian territories. The Spanish were well aware of the presence of other European powers such as the British, French and Dutch in the Americas and wanted to secure their foothold in the region.

In 1588, the Spanish Armada sailed for England with a mission to overthrow Queen Elizabeth and take control of the country. In this timeline, the Armada was victorious, and England became a vassal state of Spain. The British fleet was destroyed, and the English colonies in North America were vulnerable to Spanish attack.

The Spanish began to colonize the eastern seaboard, starting with Florida and then moving northwards. The Native American populations in the area were initially hostile, but the Spanish were able to make alliances with some tribes, such as the Timucua in Florida.

The Spanish settlements were initially small and focused on trade, particularly with the Caribbean and South America. The Spanish brought with them Catholicism and the Inquisition, which were used to control the population and convert the natives to Christianity. There was also a focus on mining for gold and other resources, which led to conflicts with the Native Americans.

One of the most significant Spanish settlements was founded in 1608 in what is now Virginia. The settlement, named San Juan, was located on the Chesapeake Bay and was intended to serve as a hub for trade with the Native Americans of the interior. The settlement was also a strategic point in the Spanish defense against the British colonies further north.

San Juan quickly grew in size and prosperity, attracting Spanish settlers from across the Americas. The settlement became an important center of Catholicism on the east coast, with several missions established in the surrounding areas.

The local Native American tribes were initially wary of the Spanish, but saw the benefits of trade and cooperation with the new arrivals. The Spanish also introduced cattle ranching to the area, which greatly improved the local food supply and led to the creation of a new landscape of fields and pastures.

The British colonies further north were increasingly concerned about the Spanish presence and presence of Spanish forts and soldiers, which the Spanish used to defend their territory and hold off any invasion attempts. There were several border skirmishes between the Spanish and British forces, but no full-scale war broke out.

There were also tensions within the Spanish colonies themselves, particularly between the Spanish settlers and the Native Americans. The Spanish were seen by the natives as invaders and oppressors, and there were several uprisings and rebellions over the years. The most significant was the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, in which Native American tribes across New Mexico rose up against the Spanish and drove them out of the region for several years.

Despite these challenges, the Spanish colonies in America continued to grow and prosper throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. The Spanish brought with them a rich culture and language, which increasingly began to influence the native populations.

In the early 19th century, as Europe entered a period of revolution and upheaval, the Spanish colonies in America remained stable and prosperous. The Spanish Empire had weathered the storm of an alternative timeline Armada and held onto its American territories. Perhaps the new revolutions in Europe would inspire the Spanish to bring more liberty and equality to their American colonies.

In conclusion, the history of the colonization of America by Spain brings a different perspective to what would have happened with the history of colonization by the British from North to South America. The Spanish culture and language have a large influence in today's world, which might have been even more pronounced in this alternate history.
