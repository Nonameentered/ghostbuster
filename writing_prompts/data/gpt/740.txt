A good Demon and a bad Angel fight while arguing ethics.
In the midst of a deserted alley, a good-natured demon and an ill-mannered angel were in heated argument over ethics.

The demon, Azazel, was not your usual demon. He had a knack for doing good and was always on the lookout for ways to help people. On the other hand, Raphael, the angel, was a notorious troublemaker, who often went on a rampage to seek fun.

Azazel crossed his arms. “I just don’t understand why you enjoy hurting humans.”

“They’re fragile beings,” Raphael shrugged. “It’s not as if they can defend themselves from us.”

“You’re punishing them for something that they hardly have any control over,” Azazel countered.

“Humans are selfish beings. They will do whatever it takes to get their way,” Raphael said, his voice laced with contempt.

“Not all of them are like that. You’re being unfair.”

Raphael let out a laugh. “Fairness? What do you even know about it? You’re a demon.”

“I may be a demon, but that doesn’t mean I can’t learn to be good. We all deserve a chance to make things right,” Azazel reasoned.

“Humans are doomed. They bring this upon themselves,” Raphael replied, his voice filled with disdain.

Azazel shook his head, his fists clenched in frustration. “That doesn’t give you the right to hurt them. We are supposed to show them the path to righteousness, not turn them away from it.”

“I’d rather spend my time having some fun instead of trying to fix things that can’t be fixed,” Raphael said with a smirk.

“We are here to help them, not turn them away,” Azazel reiterated, his voice firm.

Raphael scoffed. “You’re quite the goody-two-shoes. You think you’re any better than us because you’re good?”

Azazel took a deep breath. “It’s not about being better than anyone. It’s about doing what’s right.”

“Ah, I get it. You’re afraid to be seen as bad.”

“No,” Azazel snapped, an edge to his voice. “I’m just not willing to inflict pain on others to make myself feel good.”

“Such a hypocrite. You’re a demon, and it’s in your nature to do bad things,” Raphael said, giving him a smug smile.

“No, it’s not. That’s a stereotype, just like angels are supposed to be entirely good,” Azazel said, his voice calm.

“I don’t think so. It’s not like you’re going to do anything to stop me from hurting humans, are you?”

Azazel took a deep breath and summoned his strength. “I will stop you every time you try to hurt one.”

Raphael smirked. “Good luck with that.”

Azazel gave him a small smile. “I don’t need luck. I just need faith and determination.”

A sudden gust of wind blew, and they were thrown apart. The fight had broken the fragile balance of the universe, and they were both punished for it. They were transported to opposite sides of the world and were not allowed to return to each other's side. As a result, they realized morality isn't black and white, and they shouldn't fight over a single point of disagreement.
