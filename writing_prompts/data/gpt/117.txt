Write a Sea Shanty about an island full of dragons, guarded by three fierce women.
Come gather 'round, ye hearty crew
I've got a tale to tell to you
'Bout an island beyond the blue
Full of dragons fierce and true

T'was said that treasure rare doth lie
Beneath the earth and in the sky
But beware, ye sailors bold
For three fierce women doth this land hold

They guard the dragons day and night
With all their strength and all their might
Fearless warriors, brave and true
Their swords and shields will see ye through

The dragons, too, are not to fear
For they make this island their home near
With scales as hard as tempered steel
Their fiery breath will make ye reel

But if ye think ye have what it takes
To face the dragons and the sea's wakes
Then set a course and hoist the sails
For adventure and fortune never fails

Ye may be the one to claim the prize
Through thunderous storms and dangerous skies
But ye must first defeat the three
Fierce women guarding the land and sea

So come, me hearties, take the chance
To dance with dragons in this romance
And if ye do come back alive
Sing of this place and let it thrive.
