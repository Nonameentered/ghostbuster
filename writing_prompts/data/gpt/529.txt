The year was 1944, and the top-secret division of the S.S. was in full swing. They had one mission and one mission only - protect Adolf Hitler from the thousands of time travelers trying to kill him. The S.S. had received intelligence reports from years into the future, detailing the numerous attempts that would be made on the Führer's life. They had to act fast and prevent it all from happening.

The S.S. had erected a fortified time-travel barrier around Hitler's headquarters, making it virtually impossible for anyone to travel back in time and attempt to assassinate the dictator. They had also set up a team of highly skilled soldiers who were on constant watch for any anomalies in the space-time continuum.

One such soldier was Hans, a young and eager S.S. officer who had been handpicked by his superiors to join the top-secret time-travel division. Hans was a man of great courage and conviction, and he knew that his duty was to protect Hitler at all costs. He had been trained in the art of combat and was skilled with various weapons, including the latest firearms and explosives.

As the days went by, Hans saw the fear in Hitler's eyes grow deeper. The Führer knew that his enemies were everywhere, lurking in the shadows of time and waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike. The S.S. division was the only thing standing between him and certain death.

One day, as Hans was patrolling the perimeter of Hitler's headquarters, he noticed a strange disturbance in the air. It was a shimmering, almost invisible wave that seemed to be rippling through space and time. Hans quickly alerted his superiors, and they immediately went into action.

The S.S. soldiers formed a protective shield around Hitler, while Hans aimed his gun at the disturbance. Suddenly, a group of armed men appeared out of nowhere and began firing at Hitler. Hans reacted quickly, taking down several of the attackers with precise shots.

But he knew that more were coming, and he had to act fast. He grabbed a grenade and hurled it towards the shimmering wave, causing a massive explosion that vaporized the attackers and the disturbance.

In the aftermath, Hans learned that the attackers were time travelers from the future, who had been sent back in time to prevent Hitler from winning the war. But thanks to the S.S. division's quick thinking and bravery, Hitler was still alive, and the course of history remained unchanged.

Hans knew that his duty was far from over. He would continue to protect Hitler from the countless time travelers who would try to kill him. For he knew that the fate of Germany and the world rested on his shoulders.
