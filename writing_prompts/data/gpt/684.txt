Your child is the (next) Messiah. They have come to you for guidance before setting off. It's your last chance to speak to them as a parent.
I looked at my child, who stood before me, their eyes filled with clarity and purpose. They were the next Messiah, sent to save mankind from the path of destruction it was on. I knew this was inevitable, that my child would have to set off on a journey that would be fraught with danger and filled with uncertainty. It was going to be their destiny, and there was little I could say or do that would bring them back.

As a parent, I had raised my child to be strong and independent, to face whatever challenges came their way with courage and resilience. And now that they stood before me, ready to embark on their mission, I had one last chance to speak to them as their parent.

“Remember that you are not alone,” I said, as my child looked at me with reverence. “You carry with you the hopes and dreams of all of humanity, and wherever you go, you will see people who will look to you for guidance and inspiration.”

My child nodded, and I continued. “But never forget that you are also human. You will feel pain and suffering, and you will need to draw on your inner strength to overcome the obstacles that lie before you. Remember that the journey you are undertaking is not just physical, but also spiritual. You must always strive to be true to yourself and to God.”

I paused, trying to think of something else to say, something that would give my child hope and encouragement. And then it came to me.

“Know that wherever you go, I will be with you in spirit,” I said, my voice choking with emotion. “I will be praying for you, and I will be there to guide you whenever you need me. Even though we will be physically apart, our bond as parent and child will never be broken.”

My child stepped forward and embraced me, and I held them tightly, trying to imprint the memory of this moment onto my mind forever. I knew that when they left, I would be alone, and I would have to come to terms with the fact that my child was the Messiah, the one who had been sent to save mankind from itself.

But as I watched my child disappear into the distance, I knew that they were not alone. They carried with them the love and support of everyone who believed in their mission, including me. And I knew that whatever the future held, my child would always be my child, the one I had raised and loved, and the one who had now become the savior of the world.
