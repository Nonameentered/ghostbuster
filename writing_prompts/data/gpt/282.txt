A computer chip implanted in your brain has been influencing your decisions.
Jane woke up from what felt like a deep sleep. She looked around her room and felt a sense of ease that she could not explain. It was like every worry she had before had vanished overnight.  It felt unfamiliar to her but she felt rejuvenated. She tried to remember why she felt so good today, but all she could remember was a strange visit she had yesterday to the hospital. She wondered if that had anything to do with the sudden peace. 

Jane was a fairly successful entrepreneur, but she had been feeling overwhelmed in the past few weeks. Her commitments had been piling up, leading to anxiety, stress, and sleepless nights. She had been meaning to go to the hospital to get some medication but had kept procrastinating. So when a reputable Hospital called to inform her that they had developed a new way of treating anxiety and depression that was quick and completely non-invasive, she jumped at the opportunity. It was not until she went back to work that Jane realized that something weird was happening. 

During a meeting, Jane found herself going against her intuition completely. She had always been a sharp negotiator, but she found a strange urge to agree to conditions she would have fought against. It was unnerving, but she couldn’t shake off the urge. It's like her brain had been rebooted, and now it was working in a different way. 

The urge to follow the chip installed in her brain became more powerful by the day. She felt trapped. She wanted to speak up, but she couldn't. Her brain fought against her whenever she tried to go against the chip's directive. The more she tried to resist the urge to obey, the worse everything became. 

Jane walked into a meeting that could mean millions for her company. She felt nervous as usual, but a switch in her head flipped, and she felt a rush of euphoria. The voice in her head whispered that everything was going to be okay as long as she followed the instructions. She felt a warm feeling that calmed her nerves, and she spoke effortlessly, making a few jokes and laughing with the executives. She closed the deal without breaking a sweat. 

Jane knew that something was off. She commonly felt like she wasn't in control. The chip had grown exponentially worse since it was implanted. Whenever she tried to make a decision that didn't match the chip's directive, she would feel a wave of nausea and an overwhelming urge to follow the instructions. Jane tried to visit the hospital to have the chip removed but found that her body wouldn’t allow her to. The most she ever did was schedule an appointment, only to forget about it when the deadline approached. 

Jane noticed that her personal life was also affected. As an independent woman, Jane always knew what she wanted, but that urgency had evaporated. In a relationship with Tom, she found herself agreeing with him on issues that didn't sit well with her. She wanted to speak up, but she couldn't. The chip in her brain told her that her happiness was tied to Tom's, and she had to agree with everything he said. Her friends noticed the sudden shift, but they couldn't put a finger on what was going on. They had never met a pushover like Jane before. 

As time went by, Jane’s situation became more apparent and started to attract the interest of more people. Researchers at the hospital that installed the chip called to check on her, under the pretense of conducting a routine follow-up. They noticed the swift change in her behavior and offered to undo the chip's effects. Unwilling to let go of the piece of technology that had dictated a large portion of her life, Jane refused the offer. 

She struggled with herself after that. Was the freedom of her thoughts and actions worth the price of being under the chip's control completely? Every time she tried to make a decision for herself and reclaim autonomy, she couldn't help but feel weak. It was as though the chip was consuming her will, her spirit, and her soul. Every moment she is under the chip's sway, she moved farther away from the person she used to be. 

One day, Jane woke up with an intense headache that refused to go away no matter what she took. Everything was blurry and she could barely read the numbers on her phone, but she managed to contact her doctor. She was told to get on the first available flight to the hospital, and she did. 

As soon as she got to the hospital, she was immediately taken in for examination. The doctors noticed that the chip had been interfering with her brain's signals, shutting down areas that would've ordinarily never been tampered with. They began scrambling to save her life, trying to remove the chip without causing entirely irreparable damage. 

Jane was in a coma for several weeks before finally waking up. When she did, it was as though she was a different person, the weight of the chip free from her mind. She finally saw what the chip was doing to her, and she could not believe she had ever agreed to it in the first place. 

When Jane got better, she sued the hospital for the effects of the chip, ensuring that nobody else would have to undergo what she had gone through. Her life would never be the same, but at least she could reclaim autonomy over her thoughts and actions once again.
