Other than personal preference, how do you select which prompts to write?
As a writer, I always look for prompts that offer the possibility of taking me on a journey. For me, it's not just about creating a story, it's about exploring new territories, diving into uncharted waters, and learning something new.

To select the perfect prompt, I look for themes that resonate with me and trigger my curiosity. For example, prompts that challenge me to explore the complexities of human nature, the intricacies of relationships or the mysteries of life, always catch my attention.

I also look for prompts that offer a different perspective, something that challenges me to step out of my comfort zone and think outside of the box.

Finally, I consider the potential impact of my story on the reader. I want to create something that's not only entertaining but has the power to inspire, enlighten or provoke deep thought.

In summary, the prompts I select are those that ignite my imagination, challenge me to explore new territories, and have the potential to resonate with others.
