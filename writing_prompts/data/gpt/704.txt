e on Earth can pause time !... except for you. [WP]
There was a sense of unease that had lingered within Blake ever since he was a child. He couldn't quite put his finger on what was wrong, but there was something off about the world he lived in. It wasn't until he was in his late twenties that he figured out what it was.

Nobody else seemed to notice it, but Blake could see it plain as day. Time stopped.

It was a strange realization, but Blake could see the way that everything came to an abrupt halt around him. Cars stopped mid-traffic, birds hung mid-air, and the people on the street froze in place like mannequins. It wasn't until he moved that time resumed its natural course.

It was a power unlike anything Blake had ever known, but he quickly came to understand the importance of it. The ability to pause time meant that he could do anything he wanted without anyone noticing. It opened doors to countless possibilities, and before long, Blake found himself using his gift for personal gain.

He would stop time and slip into stores, taking whatever he wanted without anyone the wiser. It wasn't long before he was able to quit his job and live comfortably purely off the spoils of his "hobby."

For a while, Blake was content with his life. He had everything he could ever want; he was free to do whatever he wanted, go wherever he pleased, and take whatever he desired. It was a life of pure freedom, and he basked in it.

But the longer Blake lived with his gift, the more he began to realize that it was all superficial.

Despite having everything he thought he wanted, he began to feel empty inside. Every time he used his power, he couldn't help but feel guilty. He knew he was hurting others, but he tried to justify it by saying that it was for the greater good.

It wasn't until he met Emma that Blake's life began to change.

Emma was unlike anyone Blake had ever met before. She was a breath of fresh air in his life of self-service. For the first time in a long while, he felt a genuine connection with someone. Emma was kind, thoughtful, and compassionate; everything that Blake wasn't.

At first, he was hesitant to tell her about his gift. It was something that he had kept to himself for his entire life, and the idea of exposing such a massive secret was terrifying.

It wasn't until a mugging gone wrong that Blake was forced to reveal himself.

Emma had been with him when it happened. They were walking back to her apartment when a group of thugs had come out of nowhere. One had pulled a knife on them, demanding that they hand over their wallets.

Without thinking, Blake had stopped time and disarmed the attacker, all while Emma watched on in wide-eyed shock.

It was in that moment that everything changed.

Emma had questions. A million of them. And despite being scared out of his mind, Blake had felt something akin to relief for the first time since he got his gift. It was the first time he'd talked to someone about it, the first time he'd been able to share what he was going through with anyone, and it was a revelation.

Through Emma's eyes, Blake was able to see that the world was much bigger than his own little bubble. He could see the hurt he was causing, the people he was stealing from and the lives he was damaging. Blake began to realize that the life he had been living was nothing more than an empty shell of what could be.

In that instant, he made a choice.

He would stop using his gift for personal gain, and he would use it to make the world a better place.

It was a daunting prospect, but it was the right thing to do. Emma had opened his eyes, and now he could see clearly.

He started small at first; stopping time to help someone fix a flat tire, or to help an old lady cross a busy street. Then, once he felt more confident in his abilities, he moved onto bigger things. Disarming bombs, saving people from burning buildings, preventing mass shootings; you name it, Blake did it.

What surprised him the most, however, was the feeling he had. For the first time in his life, he felt fulfilled. It was a sense of purpose that he had never known before. He had been given a gift, and he was using it for the greater good. It was like a switch had flipped inside of him, one which he couldn't turn off.

Days, weeks, months went by, and Blake's good deeds became the talk of the town. People were inspired by his selflessness, and soon others began to follow in his footsteps. Blake had set off a chain reaction in his little corner of the world, and watching it unfold was one of the most satisfying experiences of his life.

Eventually, news of Blake's deeds began to reach further afield and before long, he became somewhat of a legend.

But as much as Blake enjoyed the attention, he never lost sight of what was important. He continued to use his gift to help others, and every day he felt grateful for the realization that he had.

Despite being surrounded by people who had the power to pause time, in a way that Blake never could, he felt blessed. He had been given something special; something that he could use to change the world. Blake may not have been able to stop time, but he was just as powerful, if not more so, because he could use his time to help those who needed it most.
