I’ve always been proud of my scars. They tell the story of the life I’ve lived, the experiences I’ve had, and the trials I’ve overcome. But when people ask me how I got the biggest scar on my body, I hesitate for a moment before sharing the story. It’s not a tragic one, but it’s a reminder of a time in my life when I was at my lowest, and the pain I went through to come out the other side was almost unbearable.

It all started one summer during my freshman year of college. I was working at a day camp for kids, and I loved it. There’s nothing quite like spending all day with little ones who are so full of joy and energy. But one afternoon, everything changed. I was playing a game of tag with some of the older kids when I tripped over a sidewalk crack and fell face first onto the pavement. I could feel my skin scraping against the rough concrete, and I knew right away that it wasn’t going to be pretty.

The counselors rushed over to help me up, and I could see the concern in their eyes. They took me to the nurse’s office, and I could feel the blood starting to drip down my face. The nurse cleaned up the wound as best she could, but she knew there was no way to avoid a scar. When my parents came to pick me up that day, they gasped in horror at the sight of me. My mom started to cry, and my dad pulled me into a big bear hug.

That was the first time I realized that scars aren’t just physical. They are emotional, too. Seeing my parents so upset made me feel like I had let them down somehow, like I had ruined my face forever. But as the days passed, I started to see my scar as a badge of honor. It was proof of the crazy, fun-filled summer I had had, and of the many games of tag I had won.

As the years went on, I forgot about my scar for the most part. It was just a part of me, something that had always been there. But my sophomore year of college, everything changed again. I was living in an off-campus house with some friends, and we threw a huge party one weekend. It was the kind of thing where everyone invited their friends, and soon we had dozens of people crammed into the tiny living room, dancing and laughing and having a good time.

At some point during the night, I found myself talking to a guy I had met earlier in the semester. He was funny and charming and seemed interested in me, so we exchanged numbers before the party ended. We went on a few dates, but things never really clicked between us. I didn’t mind, though – I was still having fun being young and social and carefree.

Then, a few weeks later, I got a text from him. He wanted to meet up for drinks, and I hesitated for a moment before agreeing. I didn’t really want to see him again, but I didn’t want to be rude either. So I put on my best outfit and walked to the bar downtown where we had agreed to meet.

We ordered drinks and made small talk, but something about the whole situation felt off to me. I couldn’t put my finger on it at first, but then he started asking me questions that made me uncomfortable. About my past relationships, about my sexual history, about things that were none of his business. I tried to deflect, to keep the conversation light, but he persisted.

By the time we finished our second round of drinks, I knew I needed to get out of there. I finished the last of my beer and stood up to leave, but he grabbed my arm and pulled me back down onto the barstool.

“Come on,” he said. “Let’s go back to my place.”

I shook my head and tried to pull away, but his grip was too strong.

“I said let’s go,” he repeated, this time more forcefully.

I looked around the room, hoping to see someone I knew who could rescue me, but the bar was packed and everyone seemed too absorbed in their own conversations to notice. My heart was racing, and I could feel the panic building inside me.

That’s when I felt something sharp hit my face. It was so sudden and unexpected that it took me a moment to register what had happened. Then I looked up and saw him holding a bottle – the same one that had been on the bar a moment ago – and I realized that he had smashed it against my forehead.

The pain was instant and blinding. My vision went black for a moment, and then I felt a warm trickle down my face. I could hear people shouting, screaming, but everything sounded far away. When I opened my eyes again, I saw him standing over me, looking triumphant.

“That’s what you get for leading me on,” he spat.

I don’t remember much else about that night. The rest is a blur of hospital visits, police reports, and tears. But I’ll never forget the scar above my eyebrow, stark against my pale skin. It’s a reminder of the danger that is always lurking, of the ways in which men can use their power to hurt others. But it’s also a reminder of the strength I found in myself to keep going, to not let him win. It took me months to feel normal again, to trust others and to feel safe in my own skin. But every time I look in the mirror and see that scar, I know that I survived something that could have broken me, and that I’m stronger for it.
