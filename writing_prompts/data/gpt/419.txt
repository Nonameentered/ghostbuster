Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Adelaide who lived in a small town in the middle of nowhere. Every day, she would walk to the mailbox with her mother and eagerly await the mailman's arrival. One day, Adelaide received a letter from someone she'd never heard of before - a minor cosmic horror named Zog.

Adelaide was thrilled to receive a letter from a creature from beyond the stars. She eagerly replied, asking Zog about his life and what he did all day. Zog wrote back, describing his daily routine of terrorizing other civilizations and creating chaos across the cosmos.

Despite their vastly different lives, Adelaide and Zog became fast friends and wrote to each other regularly. Adelaide would tell Zog about her schoolwork and the adventures she had with her friends, while Zog would share stories of his intergalactic travels and the epic battles he'd fought in the darkest corners of the universe.

Sometimes, Adelaide would ask Zog about his favorite things, like movies and music, and Zog would respond with confusion, as these concepts were foreign to him. Instead, he would tell her about his favorite planetary destruction techniques and the various forms of energy he could manipulate.

Their conversations were always lively and entertaining, but Adelaide noticed that Zog sometimes seemed melancholy. When she asked him about it, he confided in her that he was lonely and sometimes felt like he didn't belong in the universe. Adelaide reassured him that he did have friends and that she was always there to talk to him.

As time went on, Adelaide and Zog's letters became longer and more detailed. Adelaide drew pictures of her life and sent them to Zog, who responded with sketches of the strange and wonderful creatures he'd encountered throughout the galaxy. Through their letters, Adelaide and Zog learned about each other's worlds and found comfort in their friendship.

Although they may have been different in many ways, Adelaide and Zog proved that a little girl and a minor cosmic horror could overcome their differences and forge an unlikely but meaningful connection. Their conversations were a reminder that even in the vast expanses of the universe, there is always room for friendship and understanding.
