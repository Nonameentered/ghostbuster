After a man wrongfully spends 25 years in literal hell, he sees something he has never seen before. A door marked 'Exit'
Jacob had been imprisoned for 25 long years. He was serving a sentence for a crime that he had not committed. For all those years, he had been living in literal hell. Every day was the same. He was locked up in a tiny cell with barely enough space to move around. He had no contact with the outside world, and the only people he ever saw were the prison guards who treated him like dirt.

Jacob was once a happy man with a wife and two kids. He had a good job and a comfortable life. But one fateful day, everything changed. He was wrongly accused of stealing from his workplace. His pleas of innocence fell on deaf ears, and he was sentenced to life in prison.

For years, Jacob maintained his innocence. He wrote letters to his family, his lawyer, and anyone who would listen, but no one believed him. No one cared. The justice system had failed him, and he had no hope of ever being released.

Jacob spent years in despair, sinking deeper and deeper into depression. He lost track of time and lost all sense of who he was. But then one day, something strange happened.

He was sitting in his cell, staring at the gray walls, when he saw something move outside his small window. He blinked in surprise, wondering if he was hallucinating. But then he saw it again, a flicker of movement, something that shouldn't be there.

Jacob got up from the hard cot he slept on and crossed to the window. He peered outside and saw a flicker of grass, a flash of blue sky, and a hint of something he hadn't seen in years. It was hope.

Jacob imagined it was his imagination playing tricks on him, but he could see something more. A door marked 'Exit' stood at the end of a hall, his perception of the door blurred as if the image hadn't fully loaded.

Jacob rubbed his eyes vigorously, thinking that he had to be seeing things. He had been locked up for so long, and his mind was playing tricks on him. But the image persisted. He could see the door clearly now, and it seemed to be calling to him.

It was the first time in years that Jacob felt a flicker of hope. He had been resigned to living out the rest of his days in this hellhole, but now there was a glimmer of a chance.

Jacob tried to contain his excitement, but he couldn't help but feel a surge of energy. He had to find a way to reach that door. He scrambled to his feet and approached the door of his cell. He rattled the bars, trying to get the attention of the guards.

His initial attempts were met with silence, but then he heard the sound of footsteps approaching. The guard who had been assigned to his section appeared before him, regarding him with a sneer.

"What do you want?" the guard said gruffly.

"I saw a door," Jacob said, his words tumbling out eagerly. "It said 'Exit.' I think I can get out of here. Please, you have to help me."

The guard laughed in his face, and Jacob's heart sank. He had been so sure that he had seen the door, but maybe it was all in his head.

"You're wasting your time," the guard said. "There is no such thing as an exit in this place. You're here to stay, so you may as well make peace with that."

Jacob's hopes were dashed. He slouched back to his cot and sat down, feeling helpless and alone.

But as he sat there, something flickered in his mind again. He knew what he had seen, and he knew that there had to be a way out. He began to ponder his time in prison, looking for any clues that might help him find the door.

At first, it seemed like an impossible task. He had been kept in isolation for so long that he had no way of knowing what was happening in the rest of the prison. But as he thought more about it, he began to see some patterns.

There were certain times of day when the guards were more lenient. There were moments when they were distracted and left doors unlocked. There were ways to move around the prison without being seen.

Jacob began to plan his escape. It was a risky move, and he knew that if he failed, he would be doomed to even worse conditions. But he had nothing to lose, and everything to gain.

So he waited for his chance, and when it finally came, he seized it. He slipped out of his cell and began to move through the prison, using the knowledge he had gleaned over the years to make his way towards the door.

It wasn't easy, and he faced many obstacles along the way. But he was determined, and after what felt like hours, he finally reached the door.

It was exactly as he had seen it in his mind's eye - a simple wooden door with the word 'Exit' painted in stark black letters.

Jacob took a deep breath and pushed the door open. What he saw on the other side was something he had never seen before - the bright light of the sun, the smell of fresh air, and the sound of freedom.

For the first time in 25 years, Jacob was free. The world looked different, and he felt different too - lighter, unburdened, and full of possibilities.

As he moved out of the prison gates, he looked back at the door, his ticket out of hell. And he knew that he would never forget the feeling of seeing that door, or the hope it had given him.
