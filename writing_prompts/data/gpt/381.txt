You can earn achievements in life that give you special bonuses. Each bonus is unique and significant. As you travel by an Airplane, you find yourself in a cold sweat because of the achievement you just earned...
As the plane took off, I couldn't help but feel anxious. My palms were sweaty, and my heart was racing. I had recently achieved something significant in my life, and it came with a unique bonus. But now, as I sat there on that plane, I couldn't help but feel like I had made a mistake.

You see, the achievement I had earned was one that gave me the ability to fly on any airline for free, whenever I wanted. It was a remarkable achievement, and I had worked hard for it. But now, as I sat there on that plane, I realized that I had flown too close to the sun.

The flight attendant came by with a smile and asked me if I needed anything. I shook my head and tried to relax, but my mind kept racing. What if this plane crashed? What if I had made a mistake?

As the plane started to descend, I began to feel relieved. We landed safely, and I breathed a sigh of relief. But as I walked off the plane, I knew that I had taken a risk, and it had made me feel uneasy. I had earned a unique bonus in life, but now I knew that it came with a price.
