Dr. Sarah Harper was about to begin a simple hernia procedure when she noticed something strange. In the corner of her eye, she saw someone standing beside her in surgical scrubs. It was Death, the ubiquitous, fearsome entity that signaled the end of life. Although it was a patient's dream to fix the pain, it seemed that fate reminded her of her eventual destiny.

Sarah was a trained surgeon who had seen it all, from minor injuries to severe and life-threatening ailments. The sight of Death during surgery was unusual, to say the least. But just like a professional, Sarah continued her work and tried to ignore the dweller of the other world.

The surgery went on for an hour. She carefully incised the herniated area, ensuring that no unnecessary force or damage entered the body, and had excellent control of the procedure. As she sealed the last stitch, Sarah heard Death's voice as they said, "Well done," only when she was alone. She immediately stopped in her tracks, looking from where the voice came from, but she saw nobody.

Feeling confused and disoriented, Sarah excused herself to go for a quick break. She found a corner that was quiet to sit and ponder. A million questions lay heavy on her mind, Why did Death congratulate her? Was it even dangerous for her or her patient? Or was it just her mind playing tricks on her?

Getting frustrated, Sarah decided to regain her composure and went back to her patient's room. Her patient was recovered and doing okay, and the surgery had proven to be successful. The patient thanked her, and seconds later, the patient passed away. Sarah was devastated and could not hold her emotions. She cried in disbelief, knowing her years of experience had no effect on this particular patient.

As she tried to steady herself, she saw Death again. Death was looking right at her, and this time, Sarah noticed a shadowy hand reach out and take the departed soul from the operating table and calmly escorted them off to the next life.

From that day onwards, Sarah gained a new perspective on life. She still performed surgeries, but with an apprehensive feeling and a newfound respect for Death. Sarah subconsciously realized that the true work was being able to extend her warmth and healing to patients, even in their last moments, before Death came for them.
