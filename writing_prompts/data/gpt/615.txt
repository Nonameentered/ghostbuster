In the midst of finally Batman taking down The Joker once and for all, he also has deal with the fact he really needs a shit.
Batman had been chasing The Joker for what felt like forever. Every time he thought he had him cornered, the villain managed to escape. But this time, it felt different. Batman had a lead on The Joker's location and was determined to finally bring him to justice.

As Batman made his way to the abandoned warehouse where The Joker was said to be hiding, he couldn't ignore the feeling in his gut. He really needed to take a shit. He tried to ignore the sensation, focusing on the task at hand. He was Batman, after all. He could handle anything.

But as he approached the warehouse, the urgency in his stomach intensified. He knew he couldn't hold it in any longer. He quickly scanned the area for a bathroom, but there was none in sight. He cursed under his breath and tried to put the matter out of his mind.

Batman thought he was ready for anything, but he never anticipated this. He was so focused on The Joker that he didn't even consider the possibility that nature would call at the worst possible time. He was irritated with himself for not preparing better, but he couldn't let it distract him from the mission.

As Batman entered the warehouse, he saw The Joker standing in the center of the room, grinning and waving. Batman gritted his teeth and charged forward, ready to take down the villain once and for all. But he couldn't deny that his focus was starting to wane. The pressure in his stomach was becoming unbearable.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Batman managed to capture The Joker. He handcuffed him and dragged him out of the warehouse, feeling an immense sense of relief. But even as he handed The Joker over to the police, he couldn't shake the growing urge to relieve himself.

He rushed back to the Batmobile, but he knew he wouldn't make it home in time. He pulled over and ran into the nearest gas station, frantically searching for a bathroom. When he finally found one, he let out a deep sigh of relief.

In the end, Batman realized that he wasn't invincible. He could still be caught off guard by the most basic of bodily functions. But he had also learned the importance of being prepared, even when faced with the most high-stakes situations.
