'It all happened so suddenly'
It all happened so suddenly. One minute, Amelia was playing happily with her friends at the park, and the next, she found herself falling off the swing. She landed awkwardly on her right arm and screamed out in pain. Her friends rushed to her side and called for help.

Within minutes, Amelia was rushed to the hospital. X-rays showed that she had a broken arm and needed immediate surgery. The whole event had happened so quickly that Amelia was still in shock.

As the doctors worked on her arm, Amelia's mind raced. Why did this have to happen? She had been having such a fun day with her friends. How long would she be out of commission? Would she be able to do all the things she loved again?

Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, the surgery was over. The doctors assured Amelia that she would be back to her old self in no time. Looking back on that day, Amelia couldn't believe how suddenly life could change.
