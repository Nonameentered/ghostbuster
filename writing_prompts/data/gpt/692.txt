When you wish upon a shooting star, it's actually a satellite, and your wish has been recorded and cataloged. An agent has been assigned to your case.
As a child, I was always fascinated by shooting stars. Every time I saw one, I would make a wish, hoping that it would come true. But as I grew older, I realized that shooting stars were actually satellites and that my wishes were just a figment of my imagination.

One night, as I sat on my balcony, I saw a shooting star streak across the sky. I made a wish, just for old times’ sake, and went to bed. The next morning, I woke up to find an email in my inbox. It was from an unknown sender, with the subject line, “Your wish has been recorded.”

I opened the email to find a message from an agent, who informed me that my wish had been cataloged by the satellite and that he had been assigned to my case. I couldn’t believe it! Was my wish really that important?

The agent’s email stated that he needed to meet me in person to discuss my wish. He said that he would come to my office at 2 pm that day. I spent the entire morning speculating about what my wish could have been and what the agent wanted from me.

At 2 pm sharp, the agent arrived in my office. He introduced himself and said that he had come to discuss my wish. I was nervous as I had no idea what to expect. The agent then told me that my wish was unique and important and that it had caught the attention of some very influential people.

He handed me a folder with some paperwork, stating that I had been selected to receive a grant for my research project, which was aligned with my wish. I was thrilled and couldn’t believe that my wish had turned into something so positive.

As the agent left my office, I couldn’t help but smile. It turned out that even though shooting stars were just satellites, they could still turn wishes into reality.
