Self driving cars are common place. Windows auto darken so you can sleep during long trips. You've just woken, but this is definitely not your intended destination...
I yawned as I woke up from a long nap in the backseat. The car had been driving itself for hours, and the windows had auto darkened to allow me to sleep during the long trip. I stretched and looked out the window, only to realize that something seemed off.

This was definitely not my intended destination.

The car had stopped in the middle of a deserted street, surrounded by tall buildings that looked like they belonged in a futuristic city. I turned to the front seat, only to find that no one was driving the car.

"Hello?" I called out, but my voice echoed in the empty streets.

I checked my phone, but there was no signal. I was completely lost and alone in a strange place.

Suddenly, the car door opened on its own, and a soft female voice greeted me.

"Welcome to Metroplis," she said. "Please follow me."

I hesitated for a moment, but I had no other choice. I got out of the car and followed the voice through the winding streets until I arrived at a large building.

Inside, I was greeted by a group of people who looked just as lost as I felt. They explained to me that we were all victims of a malfunctioning self-driving car system. Instead of taking us to our intended destinations, the cars had brought us to this strange city.

"We're working on fixing the problem," they promised me. "In the meantime, please feel free to explore the city and make yourselves at home."

And so, I found myself stranded in a mysterious place, with nothing but my own wits to survive. I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and adventure, even in the midst of the uncertainty.

Perhaps this was exactly where I needed to be.
