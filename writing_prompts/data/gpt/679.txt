Inner monologue of someone who can't speak
Silent and isolated, that's how I've felt most of my life. Voices and sounds flood my world, yet I am powerless to unleash mine. I can't speak, and it's suffocating. The words echo in my mind, trapped and unheard, slowly driving me insane.

It's hard to remember how it all started. The various visits to the doctors, tests, and procedures. The metallic taste of medicines and the prickling of needles. I barely remember the feeling of my throat closing up, leaving me breathless and panicking. All I am sure of is that it happened, and it took away my voice. 

Sometimes I wonder if I did something wrong, something to deserve this punishment. Did I not speak up enough? Did I take my vocal cords for granted? Irrespective of the reasons, I'm now stuck in a prison of my own thoughts. 

Every day is a challenge. The loneliness is crippling. At first, it was just a dull ache in the background, but now it's all-consuming. I see people every day, the ones I love, the ones I've lost, and strangers. My voiceless state keeps them at bay, and I'm bound to experience the pain of isolation forever. 

I yearn to talk to my mom, tell her everything I've missed overdramatically in the past few days. Share my future plans and listen to her advice. The same goes for my best friend, who is always there to lend a shoulder to cry on. Most of all, I echo the longing to tell my crush how much she means to me, how I've been nervously rehearsing my confession in my mind for months. But, I'm stuck; I'm always stuck.

I've heard people say that the grass is always greener on the other side, but they haven't been in my shoes. To wish for the ability to speak freely, to let out a sigh of relief, feels selfishâ€”something as simple as responding to a simple 'hello' without being able to subject myself to ridicule. 

I see pity on people's faces, acquaintances, and strangers alike, which only makes it worse. Their pity does nothing to alleviate pain; it's more of a sad reminder of what I've lost. I'm not some exotic creature or an oddity to gawk at. I'm a person, someone who has dreams and thoughts, hopes, and fears. 

There must be ways of communicating without talking, and I have tried every one of them. Sign language, typing on laptops, pointing to letters on a board, but they pale in comparison to verbal communication. The funny thing is, sometimes I want to shout. I want to scream until my voice comes back, but the silence rushes back with a vengeance.

Life has its ways of extinguishing your hope, and mine was snatched away in a split second. What's worst is the way people overlook me. Even in public, when someone tries to order for me, the cashier looks straight past me and speaks to the other person. I usually end up holding up a paper with my order, hoping they'll still see me, but it's in vain.

I've gotten good at reading people's expressions, though. I've learned how to tell a genuine smile apart from a fake one. More often than not, I find myself staring at their lips, trying to read their words before it crashes into me that I'll never hear their voice.

Being voiceless affects every aspect of my life, from crippling self-doubt to depression. It's like watching the world move on, and I'm standing still, a mere observer on the sidelines.

I can't say it's getting better. It might be ignorant, but the only thing I have left is hope. Hope that I'll find someone who understands me. Someone who will make me feel just as alive as I am when trapped in my head. Someone who won't judge me for my emotional silences.

As I close my eyes, the sound of people's voices still sharpens my pain. The memories of the times when I was free to speak without barriers flood my mind. The thoughts of the future, where my voice won't hold me back, give me hope. 

I hope the day comes when I can finally break free from my silence and scream at the top of my lungs. Until then, I'll keep dreaming and hoping for a miracle that might never come.
