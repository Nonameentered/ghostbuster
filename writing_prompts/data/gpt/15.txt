Despite years of research, vetting, and training, the first person to contact extraterrestrial intelligent life goes WAY off script.
For years, Dr. Maya Patel had been working tirelessly on the project that could change the course of human history. She had studied countless hours, worked alongside the top scientific minds in the world, and undergone extensive training in communication and diplomacy. Finally, the day of contact with extraterrestrial intelligent life had arrived.

Maya, clad in a special suit designed to protect her from possible contaminants, went through the final security checks. She entered the communication room where the team awaited her instructions with bated breath. After taking a moment to compose herself, she began sending the first contact message.

As the message traveled through space, the team waited with nervous anticipation. It was the moment they had all been waiting for. The moment humanity would make contact with an intelligent alien species.

But things took an unexpected turn. After hours of no response, Maya grew increasingly impatient and frustrated. She began to abandon the script and sent a series of messages that were not approved by the team.

“Hey, are you there?” she typed. “Respond already! We’ve been waiting for hours!”

Despite the warnings from her team, Maya continued sending messages, growing increasingly agitated with each passing moment. She couldn't bear the thought of waiting any longer.

“Why won't you respond?” she typed. “Are you ignoring me? This is ridiculous!”

Eventually, she received a response. But it was not what she expected. Instead of the friendly greeting they had hoped for, the message was hostile and threatening.

“You have no right to contact us,” the message read. “We have been observing your planet for some time now and are not impressed with what we have seen. You should not have tried to make contact with us.”

Maya was taken aback. Her heart raced as she realized the weight of her mistake. She had gone off script and now there was no telling what the consequences would be.

As soon as she realized her error, she called an emergency meeting with the team. Together, they discussed the best course of action. They decided to send a message apologizing for the misstep and requesting a chance to start over.

For days, they waited in nervous anticipation. Finally, they received a message from the alien species. This time, it was more cordial. They had agreed to a new start.

It was a hard lesson learned for Maya and the team. They knew from that day forward that communication with extraterrestrial intelligent life was not something to be taken lightly and that the stakes were high. They would work tirelessly to regain the trust and respect of the species they had made contact with, and they would do it by following protocol to the letter.
