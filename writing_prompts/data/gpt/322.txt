Construction workers are exposed to a relic of magical power while beginning work on a new building. Slowly, it begins to change them...
The sun was beating down on the hard hats of the construction workers as they began excavation on a new building site. They didn't expect to come across anything unusual, but that was before they uncovered a strange, glowing artifact.

The artifact was unlike anything they had ever seen before. It pulsed with an otherworldly energy, and the workers were entranced by its beauty. They didn't know it, but they had just stumbled upon a relic of magical power. Little did they know how much their lives were about to change.

At first, the workers all felt a slight buzz in the back of their minds. They felt like they had an extra burst of energy, and they could move faster and work harder than ever before. They attributed it to the excitement of a new project and shrugged it off.

But as the days passed, they began to notice that something was different. They started to feel strange, as though something was taking over their bodies. They couldn't quite put their finger on what was happening, but they knew that they weren't the same as before.

One worker, Jim, noticed that his skin was becoming tougher and harder to penetrate. Another, Maria, began to feel a strange electricity coursing through her veins. She could sense things before they happened, and it was unlike anything she had ever experienced before.

The workers began to worry, but they were also fascinated by what they were becoming. They could feel their bodies changing, transforming into something new and powerful. They didn't know what was going on, but they knew that it was something ancient and mystical.

As the weeks passed, the workers became more and more powerful. They could lift objects with ease, run faster than before, and they no longer got tired as quickly. They were becoming like superheroes, but they didn't know how or why.

It wasn't until someone mentioned the artifact that they discovered the truth. They had been exposed to an ancient source of magical power, and it was changing them. They had become something new, something incredible, but they didn't know how to control it.

The workers made the decision to keep the artifact hidden, not wanting to cause any harm to themselves or anyone else. They knew that they were different now, and they didn't want to scare anyone. They continued to work, but with a newfound sense of power and purpose. They were no longer just construction workers â€“ they were something more.
