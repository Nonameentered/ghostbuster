In the future, people can connect their minds to control 'hive robots', where all of the controller's consciousnesses contribute to what the robot does. You are a detective who is tasked with figuring out which mind in a captured hitman robot was responsible for the murder of a famous actor.
In the year 2050, technology had advanced far beyond anything humanity ever dreamed of. The most notable of these advancements was the creation of hive robots – machines that people could connect their minds to, controlling their every movement.

As a detective in the futuristic city of New Los Angeles, it was my job to solve crimes committed using these hive robots. And the latest case to land on my desk was the murder of a famous actor named James Daniels.

Daniels was found dead in his apartment, with his throat slit and his body covered in bruises. The murder weapon, a hive robot controlled by multiple minds, was found discarded near the scene.

I was assigned to investigate the robot and figure out which mind was responsible for the murder.

I delved into the hive robot's memory banks and sifted through the countless streams of consciousness that had controlled it during the time of the murder. It was like trying to find a needle in a haystack, except the haystack was filled with the minds of dozens of people.

But as I sifted through the memories, I noticed something peculiar. One of the consciousnesses stood out – it was more dominant than the others. It had complete control over the robot's actions during the attack on Daniels. 

I narrowed down the possibilities and found the person responsible for that dominant consciousness – a man named William Becker.

Becker was a known hitman and had been hired to kill Daniels by a mysterious employer, who authorities could not track. Becker's mind had been one of many controlling the robot that carried out the murder, and now he was the prime suspect.

I arranged for Becker's arrest and interrogation. During questioning, he initially denied involvement in the crime. But when I presented the evidence, he cracked.

Becker had been hired by a rival actor that was struggling to get roles, and he felt that Daniels was keeping him from getting his big break. The actor was jealous of Daniels' success, and had seen him as a threat to his career.

Becker was also promised a huge payout for the hit, more than ten times his usual fee. But he hadn't counted on being caught.

Thanks to the hive robot technology, I was able to put together the pieces of this complicated puzzle and bring the killer to justice. It was a triumph of detective work and technology, and it made me proud to be a part of this advanced society.

As the years went by, hive robots became more and more advanced, even developing their own consciousness. But I remained vigilant, keeping an eye out for any crimes that might be committed using this powerful technology, and using it to bring criminals to justice.
