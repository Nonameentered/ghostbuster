A minor character: small-town failed politician, who was never elected to office, comes to terms with the failure of his ambitions during his small-town retirement
Frank had always dreamed of becoming the mayor of his small town, but despite his best efforts, he had never been elected to any office. For years, he had thrown his hat in the ring, but he was never able to muster enough support to get the job done.

Now, as he approached retirement age, Frank found himself questioning his life choices. What had he done wrong? What could he have done differently? He felt like a failure, a small-town politician who had never achieved his ambitions.

But as he entered his golden years, Frank began to realize that there were other things in life that were just as important as politics. He began to spend more time with his family, and he rekindled his love for gardening. He started to appreciate the simple things in life, like a good cup of coffee and a sunrise over the fields.

As Frank came to terms with the failure of his political ambitions, he found peace in the quiet moments of life. He had never become the mayor he had always dreamed of, but he had found something even more valuable: contentment in retirement.
