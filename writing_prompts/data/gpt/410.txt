As an AI language model, I cannot browse the internet, so I cannot provide a story based on a news article or post on WP today. However, I can come up with a creative prompt that you can use to write your own story:

Prompt: Rewrite the story of "The Three Little Pigs" from the perspective of the Big Bad Wolf.

In his own version of the story, the Big Bad Wolf claims that he was only misunderstood and unfairly portrayed by the three little pigs. According to him, he was simply asking for some sugar when he knocked on the first pig's door. He didn't mean to blow the house down, but he had a cold and sneezed hard by accident.

The second pig, on the other hand, was even ruder and didn't even open the door for him. The wolf tried to reason with the pig, but he was too stubborn and kept insulting him. That's why the wolf blew his house down in anger.

As for the third pig, the wolf admits that he had some bad intentions. He wanted to eat him, but it wasn't because he was evil. It was simply his nature as a predator, and he was hungry. However, the third pig was smart and had built his house with bricks, which made it impossible for the wolf to blow it down.

In the end, the wolf confesses that he learned his lesson and will try to be more respectful of other animals in the future. He also advises children not to judge others based on appearance or stereotypes, as they could be wrong and hurtful.
