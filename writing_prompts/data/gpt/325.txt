DC Comics introduces its newest superhero. This character was seemingly created for the sole purpose of offending as many readers as possible.
DC Comics had just released its newest superhero, and its name was "Trigger." With the tagline, "Sensitivity is overrated," it was clear that this character wasn't created to please the masses. Trigger's power was to trigger others, making them lose their temper and behave erratically. 

For weeks, audiences expressed their outrage on social media, claiming that the character was insensitive and insulting. Some said that it was mocking those who suffer from triggers, while others said that it was just plain rude. However, DC Comics responded by ignoring the negative feedback, standing by their decision to create Trigger. 

As the days went on, the uproar died down as people accepted they wouldn't get through to DC Comics. However, unbeknownst to the public, Trigger's creator had a hidden message in mind. They wanted to educate the public on just how mindless and destructive it is to react impulsively to someone else's provocations, especially to those we may not agree with. They wanted them to be open to dialogue and understand the difference between reacting and responding. DC Comics had the last laugh when Trigger became one of their most successful characters, and it wasn't just due to controversy, but the valuable lesson it taught. After all, actions speak louder than words.
