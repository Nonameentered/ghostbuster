Everyone since birth is given a license to kill a single person without repercussions from police/government.
In a world where everyone was given a license to kill one person without any legal repercussions, life was always a little more interesting. People often wondered who their one target would be, and how they would choose.

Jack had never given it much thought until the day he realized he had only a few months left to use his license. He grappled with the decision for weeks, until one day he saw the face of his target on the news. It was the CEO of a pharmaceutical company who had raised the prices of lifesaving drugs, causing the deaths of countless people who couldn't afford them.

Jack knew what he had to do. He tracked down the CEO's whereabouts and waited for the perfect moment to strike. He broke into his office and held him at gunpoint.

"I have a license to kill you," he said coldly.

The CEO seemed resigned to his fate, but suddenly Jack's conscience caught up with him. Was this really the right thing to do? Would killing the CEO really make the world a better place? 

After much reflection, Jack decided not to go through with it. He handed the CEO over to the police instead, hoping that justice would be served through more peaceful means.

The CEO was convicted and the news of Jack's decision to spare him made headlines. It sparked a conversation about the morality of the license to kill, and whether it was really such a good idea after all. In the end, Jack felt proud to have made the right choice.
