For centuries, the planet of Mars had been colonized by humans, primarily from the United States. Although it had been a century since the initial colonization, the Martians had still not been granted independence from their Earthly masters.

As a Martian-born human, I had grown up in a society filled with frustration and resentment. We were constantly reminded of our status as second-class citizens, denied basic rights and freedoms. But after years of quietly simmering anger, the time had finally come to take action.

I had assembled a group of fellow Martians, all of whom shared my desire for independence. We were determined to make a stand, to demand recognition and sovereignty from the United States.

Our army was small, but we were united in our cause. We marched through the streets of Mars’ largest city, flags waving and chants echoing through the air. We knew that we would face resistance from the US soldiers stationed on our planet, but we refused to back down.

As we approached the US base, we saw soldiers lining up in defense. But we were not afraid. We were fighting for our dignity and our freedom.

The battle was short but intense. Shots rang out, and explosions rocked the streets. But in the end, it was our army that emerged victorious.

As the dust settled, we stood before the remnants of the US base, our flags waving high in the air. The time had finally come for Mars to stand proudly on its own, free from the clutches of Earth’s powers.
