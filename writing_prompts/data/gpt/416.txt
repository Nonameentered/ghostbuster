Samantha had heard of Death since she was five. She lived with her grandparents, and every morning, her grandfather would tell her stories about Death inviting people to the other side. Samantha found it strange that Death had never come to her doorstep. She wasn't scared of him, like most people seemed to be.

One day, Samantha was playing with her sketchbook when Death turned up. He was different from what her grandfather had described. He was short and fragile, his black robe looking like it would fall off any second. But his eyes were bright and kind. Samantha smiled at him, offered him a drink, and asked why he had come.

"I'm here to guide you, Samantha," he said, offering his hand. "Your time here is up."

Samantha wasn't alarmed. Instead, she felt peaceful and relieved. She took Death's hand and followed him to the door, where he held it open, beckoning her out to an endless field of flowers and sunshine. 

Samantha knew that she had lived her best life, and it was time to go. She smiled at Death and took her final breath.

Death had come in his gentlest form â€“ as a guide, a friend, and a comforter.
