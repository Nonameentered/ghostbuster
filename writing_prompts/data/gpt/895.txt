As a vampire, I've experienced some pretty frustrating situations. The inability to see my reflection is certainly a pain, but it's not the most annoying thing about being undead. Instead, it's the fact that automatic doors, soap dispensers, and paper towel dispensers just do not work for me.

I learned this the hard way, of course. The first time I tried to enter a public restroom, I nearly had a panic attack when I saw the door wouldn't open for me. I assumed it was broken or needed a push, but no matter how much force I used, the door stayed stubbornly shut. Other people were coming and going with ease, but not me. I eventually had to sneak into the women's room and use the manual door before anyone could see me struggling.

It was the same story with soap and paper towels. I'd hold my hand out to the dispenser, but nothing would come out. I assumed these machines were simply faulty, until I saw them work perfectly for every other living person in the room. It was humiliating, honestly. I've never felt so invisible in my life.

I tried every trick in the book to fool these machines into thinking I was human. I would wear gloves or borrow a friend's phone and hold it out in front of me, hoping the sensors would pick up on my "presence." I even had a friend dress up as a vampire and try to use the same machines, but it was a no go. It seemed that unless I was truly alive, these machines just couldn't see me.

Of course, this wasn't just an inconvenience. There were times when it was downright dangerous. I once found myself locked inside a department store after hours because the automatic doors wouldn't open for me. It was a humiliating experience, calling out for help and praying no one would notice me before the morning crew arrived. I had to slip out through a storeroom window eventually, bruising my ego (and my arms) in the process.

I quickly learned that I had to avoid places with automatic doors and rely instead on manual entrances. However, this became increasingly difficult as more stores and offices began switching to hands-free options. Even my apartment building switched to an automatic door, leaving me to awkwardly wave my arms in front of it every time I came in or out. It started to feel like a cruel joke, that even in death I couldn't escape the indignities of everyday life.

It wasn't until I met another vampire that I finally found some relief. He'd been undead for centuries longer than I had, and he shared his secret for bypassing these machines-- pure force of will. He'd learned that if he focused hard enough on the task at hand, the machines would eventually "see" him and respond accordingly. It was a difficult skill to master, but once I started practicing it, I found that he was absolutely right. I just had to summon every ounce of energy I had and focus all my thoughts on that dang soap dispenser.

It wasn't a perfect solution, of course. I still had mishaps from time to time, usually when I was distracted or tired. But for the most part, I could now live out my (un)death without constantly being thwarted by machines. It was a small victory, but it made a huge difference in my quality of "life."

Now, if only I could figure out how to see my reflection...
