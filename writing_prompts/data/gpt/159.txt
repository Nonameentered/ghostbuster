Joseph and the virgin Mary decide Jesus is old enough for 'the talk,' and tell him about where babies come from.
Joseph and the virgin Mary sat down with their son, Jesus, to have "the talk." Jesus was apprehensive at first, not sure why his parents were being so serious.

"Son," Joseph began, "it's time we tell you about where babies come from."

Jesus looked confused. "What do you mean, father?"

Mary took over. "When a man and a woman love each other very much, they come together in a special way. And sometimes, if it's meant to be, a baby will grow inside the woman's belly."

Jesus listened intently, trying to wrap his mind around the concept. "So that's why people get married?" he asked.

"Yes, sweetheart," Mary replied. "Marriage is a special commitment between a man and woman to love and care for each other and any children they might have."

As they talked, Jesus realized the importance of taking relationships seriously and treating others, especially women, with respect. He may have been young, but he was wise beyond his years.

From that day forward, Joseph and Mary knew their son was equipped with knowledge and values that would guide him throughout his life.
