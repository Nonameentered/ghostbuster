A serial killer stalks his next victim for a week- watching and getting to know her schedule. What he doesn't know though is- he, too, is being stalked by yet another, more violent serial killer who ends up killing both him and his original intended victim.
It was just another day for Rachel as she walked out of her office building, heading towards her car. She didn't notice the man lurking in the shadows, watching her every move as she walked down the dark alleyway. His name was Jack, and he had been following her for a week now, watching her every move and learning her routine.

Jack had been planning this for months, searching for the perfect victim to satiate his desire for blood. Rachel had just been in the wrong place at the wrong time, perfect for him to stalk and eventually kill.

Jack had been studying her every move, memorizing her schedule, and planning the perfect moment to strike. He knew when she left for work in the morning, when she went to lunch, and when she left for home. He knew where she lived, where she worked, and even who her friends were.

But as Jack continued to stalk Rachel, he didn't realize that he, too, was being watched and followed by someone else. Someone even more dangerous and more violent than he was.

His name was Edward, and he had been watching Jack for days. He had noticed a pattern in Jack's movements and realized that he was stalking someone. But rather than intervening, Edward decided to wait and see what Jack would do next.

For days, Edward followed Jack as he watched Rachel. And then, finally, the night came when Jack planned to strike. Rachel was leaving work later than usual, and Jack saw this as the perfect opportunity to attack.

As Rachel walked down the dark alleyway towards her car, Jack stepped out of the shadows, holding a knife in his hand. Rachel didn't even have a chance to scream before Jack plunged the knife into her chest.

But before Jack could escape, another figure stepped out of the darkness. It was Edward, and he was not happy with Jack's actions. Edward had been watching Jack for a week, and he knew everything about him, including his plans to kill Rachel.

Edward quickly tackled Jack to the ground, and the two men began to fight. Jack tried to overpower Edward, but he was no match for the larger, stronger man.

In the end, it was Edward who emerged victorious, killing Jack with his own knife. But as Edward was about to leave, he realized that he had made a terrible mistake. Rachel was lying on the ground, bleeding and dying, and there was nothing he could do to save her.

Edward had been so focused on stopping Jack that he had forgotten about his original goal, to protect Rachel. And now, she was dead, and it was all his fault.

Feeling guilty and remorseful, Edward turned himself in to the police. He confessed to the murder of both Jack and Rachel and was sentenced to life in prison.

In the end, what started out as a simple case of stalking turned into a tragic and senseless act of violence. Two lives were lost, and one man's obsession ended up destroying everything he had worked so hard to achieve.

The lesson to be learned from this story is simple: violence begets violence, and obsession can lead to nothing but destruction. It's important to let go of our desires and focus on what's truly important in life, before it's too late.
