Samantha had always loved baking. She found it therapeutic and enjoyed creating delicious treats for her friends and family. But Samantha had never expected her oven to start duplicating whatever she put in it.

It had started innocuously enough. Samantha had been preparing a batch of cookies, and as she took them out of the oven, she realized that there were more than she had originally baked. Puzzled, she had gone back to check the recipe and realized that she hadn't doubled the ingredients. She shrugged it off, assuming that she had miscounted and went on with her day.

But then, it happened again. This time with muffins. Samantha had only made six, but when she opened the oven, double the amount stared back at her. She tried to explain it away as some kind of baking magic, but the more it happened, the more she realized that something was wrong with her oven.

Samantha decided to experiment. She put a fork, a spoon, and a knife in the oven and closed the door, waiting for the duplicates to appear. Sure enough, a few minutes later, three forks, three spoons, and three knives were in her oven.

Samantha couldn't believe it. Her oven was duplicating things. At first, it was exciting. She started cooking up a storm, putting in all kinds of things to see what would happen. A single chicken breast would become two, a single banana would become two, even a single egg would become two.

As much as Samantha enjoyed the novelty of her oven, she soon realized the implications of what she had discovered. If her oven duplicated everything she put in it, it could change her entire life. She could duplicate money or anything else she wanted.

Samantha's conscience nagged at her. She knew that what she was doing was wrong, but she couldn't resist the temptation. She started duplicating things left, right, and center. Her small apartment soon overflowed with duplicates of everything from food to clothing to electronics.

But Samantha's newfound wealth came at a price. She had become addicted to duplicating things, and the more she did it, the more it seemed to drain her. Her energy was sapped, and she became plagued with anxiety and guilt.

One day, as Samantha was putting yet another apple into her oven, she realized that she couldn't keep going like this. The duplicator was slowly killing her, both physically and morally. With tears in her eyes, Samantha resolved to stop duplicating things and go back to a simpler, more honest life.

As she made the decision to move forward, Samantha started to feel a sense of relief that she hadn't felt in months. She began to clean out her apartment and get rid of all the duplicates. She donated the food to the local food bank, the clothes to the homeless shelter, and the electronics to a recycling center.

With only what she needed, Samantha was happier than she had been in a long time. She realized that the duplication had consumed her life and that the simpler things were what mattered most. As she enjoyed her first non-duplicated apple in weeks, Samantha felt grateful for her newfound sense of freedom. She had learned that sometimes, less is more, and that there is great value in living an honest life.
