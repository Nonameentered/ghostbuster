At night, when everything is dark and silent.
At night, when everything is dark and silent, Luke would sneak out of his bedroom window to explore the mysteries of his small town. He tiptoed through the streets, careful not to wake anyone up. The silence was unsettling at first, but Luke soon found comfort in the solitude.

He made his way to the old abandoned mansion on the outskirts of town. It was said to be haunted, but Luke was never one to believe in ghosts. As he approached the front door, he heard a faint whisper. Startled, he stopped in his tracks. The whisper grew louder and was soon joined by the sound of creaking footsteps.

Terrified, Luke turned to run but was met by a dark figure looming behind him. He let out a scream and woke up, realizing it was all just a nightmare. From then on, Luke stayed in his warm bed at night, no longer tempted to explore the dark and silent unknown.
