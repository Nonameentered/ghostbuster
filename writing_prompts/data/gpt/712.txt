On the edge of the known universe is a campfire, and around it are three figures, indistinct and huddling; refugees from the universe before our own.
In the vast expanse of the universe, there was a solitary campfire burning brightly, illuminating the darkness of space. Three figures were huddled around it, their shapes indistinct and their faces hidden by the flickering flames.

These were refugees from the universe before our own, displaced by unimaginable cataclysms that had torn apart their homes and their world. They had fled through the swirling vortexes of space-time, seeking sanctuary in the uncharted regions at the edge of the known universe.

The first figure was a tall and wiry creature, with long limbs and sharp features. Its skin was a mottled green, and its eyes were black and unblinking. It had once been a proud warrior in its previous universe, but now it was just a scared and lonely soul, lost in the darkness of space.

The second figure was smaller and more delicate, with a slender body and fragile wings. It was an angel, one of the last of its kind, its once-glorious wings now tattered and torn. It had watched as its celestial realm was crushed by cosmic forces beyond its understanding, and had fled into the unknown with nothing but its faith to sustain it.

The third figure was the most enigmatic of all. It was a shrouded figure, cloaked in a robe of black and silver, with only its piercing eyes visible through the darkness. It spoke little and revealed nothing of its past, but the other two refugees knew instinctively that it too had suffered great losses in the endless void of space.

For months, they had wandered through the fringes of the universe, surviving on scraps of food and water, and sheltering from the violent storms that raged through the cosmos. But now, they had found each other, and this small campfire was their only solace in a merciless and indifferent universe.

"We have seen terrible things," said the first creature, its voice soft and melancholy. "Entire worlds swallowed by black holes, entire galaxies consumed by flames. And yet, somehow, we have survived."

The angel nodded solemnly, its wings fluttering weakly in the breeze. "I have seen the very fabric of my reality unravel and disintegrate. I have seen the heavens cast down and the stars go out. And yet, somehow, I have retained my faith."

The shrouded figure said nothing, but merely stared into the flames with its cold eyes, lost in thought or memory.

And so they sat there, the three refugees from a universe long gone, warming themselves by the flickering fire. They were alone in the darkness, but somehow they had found each other, and that was enough for now.

For a few quiet moments, they forgot about their pains and their sorrows, and they simply existed, three strange creatures around a small campfire, on the very edge of the known universe.
