Pick your poison- write about the day of an addict.
It was just another day for Jake, waking up with a pounding headache and a dry mouth. He fumbled around for his phone, checking the time, and realized he had missed his morning meeting with his sponsor. Groaning, he dragged himself out of bed and trudged to the bathroom, splashing water on his face, trying to wake himself up. 

Jake had been an addict for a long time, ever since his father had died when he was just a teenager. He had turned to drugs and alcohol to ease his pain, slowly spiralling out of control. It had taken several failed stints in rehab, a few brushes with the law, and nearly losing his family before he had finally found the strength to get sober. But it was a constant battle, and some days were worse than others.

He headed down to the kitchen, grabbing a coffee, while trying not to think about the drugs and alcohol that were hiding in the back of his mind, tempting him. He had a job to go to, but these days it was just a way to pay the bills, a distraction from the demons that were always lurking inside him.

He had a routine, just like any other addict. Meetings, therapy, working out, anything to keep his mind and body busy, to keep himself from slipping back into a cycle of abuse. But some days it was harder than others, and he felt like he was drowning in his own thoughts.

As the day wore on, the cravings grew stronger. He tried to distract himself, working on his project for work, but his mind was elsewhere, dwelling on the past. Memories of his father, moments of pain and loss, mixed with the desire to numb himself, to escape.

He knew he shouldn't, but the temptation was too strong. He found himself at a bar after work, nursing a beer, trying to justify it to himself. Just one drink to take the edge off, he told himself, knowing deep down it was a lie.

Before he knew it, the sun had set, and he was huddled in a corner booth, several empty glasses in front of him. The alcohol had loosened his tongue, and he found himself spilling his guts to the bartender, a stranger who would never judge him.

He talked about his struggles, his frustrations, and his fears. He talked about the voices in his head that told him to give in, to take the easy way out. And the bartender just listened, nodding sympathetically, pouring him another drink.

Jake knew he was in trouble, but he couldn't stop himself. He was too deep, too far gone, and he needed something to take the edge off. He stumbled out of the bar, barely able to stand, but unwilling to go home.

He found himself outside a dingy apartment complex, where he knew some of his old acquaintances lived. The ones who still dabbled in drugs, who had never been able to kick their addictions.

Before he knew it, he was in a dingy bedroom, a needle in his arm, the world spinning around him. He was lost in a haze of euphoria, his senses dulled, his mind numb. For a few brief moments, he felt like everything was okay, like he was in control.

But then reality hit, like a hammer to the head. He was lying on the floor, surrounded by empty bottles and needles. His heart was pounding, his body shaking, and he knew he was in trouble.

He struggled to his feet, stumbling out of the dirty apartment, trying to remember where he was and how to get home. He was lost, disoriented, and he knew he had messed up big time.

As he made his way through the darkened streets, he felt like a ghost, like his body was separate from his mind. The world was spinning around him, and he was barely holding on.

By the time he made it home, the sun was rising, and his family was awake, waiting for him. They saw the state he was in, the bloodshot eyes, the dishevelled clothes, the stench of alcohol and drugs on his breath.

They were angry, confused, hurt. They had seen this before, too many times, and they didn't know what to do. They tried to talk to him, to reason with him, but he couldn't hear them.

He was lost in a fog, a world of his own making, and he couldn't see a way out. He knew he had hit rock bottom, but he didn't know how to climb back up.

It took months of hard work, therapy, and support from his family and friends, for Jake to finally get back on his feet. He knew he had made a mistake, a big one, but he was determined not to let it define him.

Every day was a struggle, but he knew he wasn't alone. He had the support of his sober friends, his family, and his sponsor. He had a purpose, a reason to keep fighting.

He couldn't change the past, but he could control the present. And that was all that mattered.

Jake had learned to pick his poison, not the temptation that led to his downfall, but the friends, the family, and the love that kept him grounded.
