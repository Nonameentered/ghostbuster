40,000 years from now humans and nature have been at perfect equilibrium for thousands of years. Describe the world and lifestyles of people on planet Earth.
40,000 years had passed since humans and nature reached perfect equilibrium. The world had transformed into a flourishing garden of Eden, where man and animals lived harmoniously and without harm to mother earth.

The air was crisp, pure and healthy, boasting of rich oxygen levels. The sky was a vibrant blue, and the stars shimmered brightly in the night, alluding to the countless possibilities of the universe. Forests and oceans covered vast expanses of the land, with every species of flora and fauna that ever existed thriving in a synchronized system. Earthquakes, floods, and storms were a thing of the past, with nature reacting optimally to every environmental demand.

People had learned to migrate with migrating animals, adopting and cultivating new land alongside different species, promoting balance. They moved once every decade to give nature ample time to restore the landscape.

Technology had advanced significantly, and people depended on clean energy that didn't have an adverse effect on the ecosystem. Robots and machinery carried out mundane tasks that endangered human life or the environment. Humans spent most of the time doing things they love, such as art, music, or literature. They were creative beings, and the absence of the competitive culture created an environment that fostered experimentation and innovation. 

People lived in brilliant, aesthetic domes that blended with the surrounding environment- the roof made of transparent glass, allowing people to see what's above and ease the feeling of inhibition. They enjoyed games with each other, laughed, and even cried; for, in a world with perfect balance, it's okay to express emotions.

However, people knew that they had to treat nature with respect, for a single act of greed could tilt the scale out of balance, and the long-harmonious existence would be destroyed for future generations, and they wouldn't allow that to happen.
