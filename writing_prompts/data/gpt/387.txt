I've seen a lot in my years as a haunted house. Kids coming in with their friends, daring each other to stay the night, only to leave with their tails between their legs. Ghost hunters, trying to capture evidence of the paranormal. I even had a family move in for a short time, but they didn't last long. They couldn't handle my creaky floors, slamming doors, and strange noises.

But now, I'm about to face something entirely different. The police are coming to raid me. They think that I'm home to something sinister, that I'm a hub for illegal activity.

I don't know what they expect to find. Maybe they think there are drug dealers here, or that I'm a front for some kind of human trafficking ring. But all I am is a house, a place where people come to be scared. There's nothing illegal about that.

But I know that won't matter to them. They'll barge in, guns drawn, and start tearing me apart. They won't care about the history I hold or the memories that have been made inside my walls. They'll see only what they want to see.

As I wait for them to arrive, I can feel my windows rattling and my doors shaking with anticipation. I know this won't end well. But even if they destroy me, I'll always be here, watching and waiting for the next group of thrill-seekers to come through my doors.
