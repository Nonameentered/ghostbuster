Once upon a time, in a small town of Salem, lived a dyslexic devil-worshiper named Damien. He spent his days trying to summon demons and casting spells, but nothing ever seemed to work out in his favor. The demons ignored him, and the spells he cast always went wrong.

One day, while browsing online to find a new spell to cast, he stumbled upon a website that promised to fulfill any wish granted to those who sell their souls to the great Santa.

Desperate for any help, Damien quickly filled out the form and clicked submit. To his surprise, the next day, a jolly man in a red suit appeared in his living room, carrying a huge sack on his back.

"I've come to collect your soul," said Santa, with a smile on his face.

Damien hesitated at first, but as he thought about the endless possibilities that Santa could grant him, he finally agreed.

Santa offered him a deal: in exchange for his soul, Damien would get to complete his own spellbook, and Santa would help him cast the spells. Damien agreed, and the two of them quickly got to work.

As the days passed, Damien couldn't believe the things he was able to do with Santa's help. His spells were more powerful, and he was able to summon demons he never could before.

But as Christmas approached, Damien realized that there was more to Santa than he had ever thought. Santa was a kind and generous man, who helped others without expecting anything in return.

Overwhelmed with guilt, Damien started to reconsider the deal he made with Santa. He knew he couldn't back out of it, but he knew Santa deserved better.

So, on Christmas Eve, Damien decided to use his magic to make Santa's delivery run go smoothly. He helped Santa deliver presents to all the children in the world, without taking anything in return.

In the end, Damien learned that selling his soul to someone as kind as Santa was the best decision he ever made. And from that day forward, he decided to use his magic for good, knowing that Santa would always be there to help him out when he needed it.
