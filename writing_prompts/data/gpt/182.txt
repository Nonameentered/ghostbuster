what is your favorite prompt you've written? post it here with the prompt that inspired it.
It was a hot summer day, the kind of day that makes you want to stay inside and do absolutely nothing. But, as I sat there staring at my laptop, I couldn't help but think about my favorite writing prompt that had helped me write some of my best work.

The prompt was simple: "Write about a time when you were lost."

As I sat there, I reflected on a particular moment that had stuck with me for years, one that I had never told anyone about. It was a moment that had made me feel truly lost, both physically and emotionally.

It had been a few years since my grandfather died, and my family had decided to take a trip to his homeland in Ireland. None of us had ever been there before, and we were all excited to see where my grandfather had come from and learn more about his culture.

One day, we decided to take a hike through the countryside. The sun was shining, birds were chirping, and the green fields stretched out for miles. It was the perfect day for a hike.

As we made our way down the narrow paths, I couldn't help but feel in awe of my surroundings. The beauty of Ireland was breathtaking, and I felt so lucky to be able to experience it.

But, as we continued down the path, I realized that we had gotten a bit off track. We had been following the signs, but they seemed to have disappeared, and we were left with no idea which direction to go.

I tried not to panic, but the feeling of being lost was beginning to set in. I looked at my family, and they seemed just as lost as I was.

We continued walking, hoping to find a sign or someone who could help us. But, as time passed, it became clear that we were truly lost. We had no idea where we were, and we were running low on water and food.

As we continued to walk, my thoughts began to spiral. What if we never found our way back? What if we were stuck here forever? My anxiety was through the roof, and I was beginning to feel overwhelmed and scared.

But, despite all of this, I couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at the situation. It almost felt like an adventure, like we were explorers discovering a new land. And, in a way, that's exactly what we were doing. We were experiencing a side of Ireland that most tourists never saw.

Eventually, we stumbled upon a small village, and a kind local was able to point us in the right direction. As we made our way back to our hotel, I felt relieved, happy to be back in familiar territory.

But, looking back on that moment, I realized that it had changed me. It had made me feel truly lost and uncertain, but it had also shown me the beauty in the unknown.

As I finished typing up the story, I couldn't help but feel proud. It was one of my favorite pieces I had ever written, and it had all stemmed from a simple prompt.

I smiled to myself, feeling grateful for the inspiration that writing prompts had brought me. And, as I closed my laptop and went outside to enjoy the sunny day, I couldn't wait to see where my next prompt would take me.
