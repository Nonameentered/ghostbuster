You jokingly recite an incantation. It worked.
As I sat with my friends around the bonfire, I felt a sudden urge to recite a spell or incantation just for fun. I didn't believe in magic or anything supernatural, so I thought it would be entertaining to see my friends' reactions.

Without thinking twice, I blurted out a gibberish phrase that sounded like a spell from a fantasy movie. My friends chuckled and rolled their eyes, and we went back to chatting and telling stories.

But then something strange happened. As the fire roared higher, the wind picked up, and the trees rustled, I felt a sudden charge in the air. It was as if a powerful energy was flowing through my body, pulsing in my veins and making me tremble.

At first, I thought it was just my imagination playing tricks on me, but then I saw my friends staring at me with wide eyes and open mouths. They too had felt the surge of power and were now staring at me as if I had just conjured a demon.

"What did you do?" one of them asked, his voice trembling.

"I don't know," I replied, feeling a mixture of fear and excitement. "I was just messing around."

But it was too late to take back the spell or whatever it was that I had cast. The air around us was charged with magic, and we were caught in the middle of it.

Suddenly, the fire exploded, sending sparks and flames into the air. The trees shook violently, and the ground beneath our feet rumbled with an unknown energy. It was as if we were trapped in a vortex of power, unable to escape or control what was happening.

My friends and I huddled together, holding hands and praying for the chaos to stop. We had no idea what was happening or how we had triggered this supernatural force, but we knew we had to find a way to stop it before it was too late.

It took a few moments, but eventually, the power subsided, and the world around us returned to normal. The fire died down, the wind stopped, and the trees were still again. We were left standing, dazed and confused, but unharmed.

We looked at each other, trying to make sense of what had just happened. Maybe it was a coincidence, or perhaps it was something more. But one thing was for sure - we would never joke about magic again.
