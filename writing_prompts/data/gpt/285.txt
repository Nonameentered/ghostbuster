It had been a lie that I had kept buried for so many years, one I thought would never see the light of day. But as I stood there, with the accusing eyes of my best friend boring into me, I knew I couldn't hide it any longer.

"I-I lied about my GPA, okay?" I stammered, feeling the weight of my deceit pressing down on me.

My friend's expression softened, but the hurt was still evident in her eyes. "Why would you do that? We're supposed to be honest with each other."

"It was just a stupid mistake," I said, feeling more and more ashamed with each passing moment. "I was worried I wouldn't get into college, and I didn't know how else to prove myself. I thought it wouldn't matter."

"But it does matter," my friend said, her voice laced with disappointment. "I trusted you, and you broke that trust."

"I know," I said, tears stinging my eyes. "I never meant to hurt you. Please forgive me."

My friend hesitated for a moment before nodding slowly. "I'll forgive you," she said. "But you need to make things right. You have to come clean to everyone you lied to."

And with a heavy heart, I knew she was right. The truth had to come out, no matter how painful it might be.
