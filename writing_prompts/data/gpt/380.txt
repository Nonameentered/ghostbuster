Write me an intimate monologue leading up the kill. Your first or last.
I never wanted to be this person. The one who takes another life. But it seems like fate has painted me into a corner. I’ve tried all the other options, but they just didn’t work. Killing seems to be my only choice.

I’ve spent countless hours debating this decision. Thinking about the consequences, the ramifications, the ethical implications. But ultimately, I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s them or me.

I know this may sound cold and calculating, but it’s the truth. I’ve been pushed too far, my back up against the wall. And now, this is the only way out.

I’m not proud of what I’m about to do. But I’m not ashamed either. It’s a necessary evil. In fact, I almost feel like I’m doing a service to society. Getting rid of someone who doesn’t deserve to be here.

I keep telling myself that it’s just like taking out the trash. You don’t think twice about throwing away something that’s no longer useful, that’s just taking up space. And that’s what this person has become to me. They’ve become like garbage, polluting my life with their toxicity.

As the time draws nearer, I can feel my resolve hardening. I know what I have to do, and I’m not going to back down. I’m not going to let this person ruin my life any longer.

It’s them or me. And in this moment, I choose myself. I choose my own survival. And if I have to take another life to ensure it, then so be it. It’s my first kill, and it may very well be my last. But I know that I’ll never forget it, and I’ll never look back.
