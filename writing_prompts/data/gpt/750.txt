You're walking down the street and bump shoulders with someone. It's you.
I was walking down the busy street lost in my thoughts trying to figure out my life. Suddenly, I bumped shoulders with someone. I turned to apologize but was overcome with confusion when I realized that I had just bumped into myself. At first, I thought it was just my imagination that was playing tricks on me, but when I looked closely, there was no denying it. It was me, staring back at me.

We looked at each other in silence, both trying to comprehend what was happening. But then he smiled, a genuine smile, the kind that I had not seen on my face in a long time. His smile was contagious, and I found myself smiling back at him.

“Hey,” he said in a friendly voice.

“Hey,” I replied, still in disbelief.

He took a step forward and hugged me. It was an awkward hug, but it felt comforting. Then he whispered, “you got this.” Those three words shook me to my core, and suddenly, all of my confusion and worries began to dissipate.

He let go of me and walked away, leaving me standing there, feeling a sense of relief and determination I had not felt before. As I continued to walk, I knew that I had just experienced an encounter with my future self, reminding me that everything would be alright and that I should never give up on myself.
