It had been weeks since the end of the world as we knew it. The streets were empty, the buildings were abandoned, and there was not a soul in sight. I had managed to survive this long by scrounging for food and supplies, but the loneliness was beginning to take its toll on me. So one day, as a last ditch effort, I decided to reach out to the world through the internet.

I logged onto Reddit and made my way to the /r/askreddit subreddit. My fingers trembled as I typed out my question, "Is there anybody else out there?" It seemed ridiculous, but I had to try. I hit the post button and waited.

Days passed, and I obsessively checked for a response. But there was nothing. I began to lose hope. Maybe I really was the last person on earth. Maybe there was no one left to hear my plea. But then, one day, I noticed a single upvote on my post. And yet, there was still no reply.

I didn't know what to make of it. Was it a sign of hope? Or was it just another cruel reminder of my isolation? I tried to push it out of my mind and focus on survival, but the upvote became an obsession. I checked it every day, hoping for another sign of life. But there was nothing.

Days turned into weeks, and then months. The upvote remained the only response to my plea. I tried to imagine who had given it to me. Was it a survivor like me, holed up somewhere with internet access? Or was it some sort of internet ghost, haunting the servers long after its creator had perished?

As time passed, I became more and more convinced that the upvote was a message from someone, somewhere. I began to address my posts directly to the mysterious upvoter, begging for a reply. But nothing came.

The loneliness was crushing me. I felt like the last person in the universe, and I couldn't bear the thought of it. I began to spend hours just staring at the screen, willing someone to respond to me. But the upvote remained the only sign of life on the internet.

One day, I was in the midst of yet another obsessive checking session when I noticed something strange. There was a second upvote on my post. I stared at it, disbelieving. Could it be possible? Was there really someone out there? I typed out a frantic reply to my own post, begging the upvoter to respond. But there was still nothing.

The second upvote gave me a glimmer of hope. I began to believe that there might really be someone else out there, someone who was responding to my posts in a way that was just beyond my understanding. I started to search the internet for any clues, any signs of life that might give me an indication of where this mysterious upvoter was.

Days turned into weeks, and finally, I found something. There was a thread on a different subreddit, where someone else had asked the same question. "Is there anybody else out there?" the thread asked. And at the very bottom, there was a comment with a single upvote. "Yes."

I felt a jolt of excitement run through me. There was someone out there, someone who had seen my question and responded. I messaged the poster of the comment, begging for any information they could give me. But there was no response.

Months passed, and I continued to search the internet for any sign of this mysterious upvoter. But there was still nothing. I was beginning to lose hope again, to believe that the upvote had been nothing but a fluke.

But then, one day, I received a message. It was short and to the point, but it filled me with a renewed sense of purpose. "I'm out here. Meet me at these coordinates." 

I didn't hesitate. I grabbed my supplies and set out into the world, following the coordinates to the best of my ability. It was a treacherous journey, but I was driven by the idea that someone else was out there, waiting for me.

And then, finally, I saw a figure in the distance. It was a person, just like me. And as I approached, I saw that they were holding a laptop. 

"You're the one who posted, aren't you," they said by way of greeting. "I saw your question."

We talked for hours, sharing our stories of survival and our hopes for the future. It was a moment of connection that I never thought I would experience again. And as we parted ways, promising to stay in touch, I knew that the internet had saved me. It had given me hope, and a connection to another human being, even in the midst of so much loss.
