Write a poem wherein, when read forward it is from the perspective of a murder victim. Read backward, it is from the perspective of the killer.
I lay here motionless, the killer's deed is done
Life slipping away, I can feel my breaths getting done

Memories flood my mind, flashbacks of better days
His face contorts with anger, an eerie grimace it displays

I see my family and friends, their sorrow and despair
He approaches with a knife, their cries he doesn't hear

I wish I could just stay, but I know I must go 
His grip on the weapon, his anger begins to grow 

The world fades to black, I take my final breath 
He walks away calmly, like it's just another death

I'm leaving this world, so much left unaccomplished 
He just took a life, leaving it forever tarnished

No more dreams for me, no chance to make a mark 
He'll never forget that night, forever be in the dark.
