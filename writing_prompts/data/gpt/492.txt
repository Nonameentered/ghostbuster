As Maya stood in line at the airport security checkpoint, she couldn’t help but roll her eyes at the TSA agent’s announcement. “Please remember, TSA rules prohibit bottles of liquid over three ounces, knife blades over two inches, and the use of spells, curses, scrolls or other magic beyond the security checkpoint.”

Maya had been practicing magic since she was eight years old and had never once encountered such a ridiculous set of rules. Magic was a part of her life, and she couldn’t imagine traveling without it. Nevertheless, she began preparing for the security check by taking out all of her magic gear from her carry-on bag.

As the line began to move forward, Maya couldn’t help but notice how tense the air was in the security area. TSA agents were inspecting each traveler closely, even confiscating harmless items like nail clippers. They even had a special wand that could detect magical energy.

When Maya got to the front of the line, she took a deep breath and stepped forward. The TSA agent looked at her suspiciously as Maya emptied out her carry-on bag. The agent raised an eyebrow when she saw a small bottle of potion, a wand, and a leather-bound book.

“What are these for?” the agent asked.

Maya explained that she was a wizard and that these were her tools of the trade. The TSA agent still looked skeptical but put her wand over Maya’s carry-on items and declared that there was no magical energy.

Maya breathed a sigh of relief as she put her magic gear back into her bag. She couldn’t wait to get on the plane and start practicing some new spells she had learned.

As she sat in her seat on the plane, Maya took out her leather-bound book and began reading. She was so engrossed that she didn’t even notice the elderly woman sitting next to her until the woman spoke up.

“Excuse me, dear,” the woman said. “I couldn’t help but notice you’re reading that book. Is it a novel?”

Maya looked up and smiled. “No, it’s actually a spellbook.”

The woman looked at her incredulously. “A what?”

“A spellbook,” Maya repeated. “I’m a wizard.”

The woman looked both confused and frightened. “A…wizard? You mean like in Harry Potter?”

Maya nodded, amused. “Yes, like Harry Potter.”

The elderly woman visibly relaxed, relieved to learn that wizards weren’t all that scary after all. “Oh, okay then. As long as there’s no danger involved.”

Maya chuckled. “Don’t worry, I won’t use any spells on the plane.”

The woman smiled and went back to her book, probably more at ease knowing that Maya wasn’t going to turn everyone into frogs.

As the plane took off, Maya let her mind wander to the new spells she had learned. She couldn’t wait to test them out and see what kind of results she could get. But as the plane reached cruising altitude, Maya realized there was a problem.

Her wand was missing.

Maya’s heart sank as she frantically searched her carry-on bag, her purse, and even the seat pocket in front of her. But the wand was nowhere to be found.

Suddenly, Maya felt a wave of panic wash over her. She knew that without her wand, she would be unable to cast any spells on the plane, which could be disastrous if something were to go wrong.

Maya immediately approached the flight attendant and explained the situation. The attendant was sympathetic but explained that they couldn’t land the plane or make an emergency stop because of a missing wand.

Maya was at a loss. She had never felt so helpless in her life. But then she remembered the TSA agent’s warning. TSA rules prohibit…spells.

Maya closed her eyes and focused. She dug deep within herself and began to chant the words of a powerful spell. She felt a warmth spread through her body as she called upon the magic within her.

And then, suddenly, her wand appeared in her hand.

Maya opened her eyes and looked down at the wand, astounded. She had never been able to perform magic without a wand before.

As the plane landed, Maya got off and made her way through the terminal, still in shock from what had just happened.

She couldn’t believe that she had just performed magic without her wand. And she couldn’t wait to learn more about what she was capable of. But most of all, Maya was grateful for the TSA agent’s warning, because without it, she may never have learned that she was capable of so much more than she ever thought was possible.
