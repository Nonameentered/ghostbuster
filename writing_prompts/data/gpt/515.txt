I remember the day when humanity fled Earth like it was yesterday. The planet was dying and there was no way to save it. The people left in mass exodus, leaving behind all they knew and loved. It was a heartbreaking sight to witness, but I had no choice but to stay behind.

I was the only one who remained on Earth, and it wasn't long before I started to feel their presence. The gods of the planet, the ones humans had worshipped for centuries, stayed behind. They were a powerful force, and they were obsessed with getting me to worship them.

At first, it was just a few whispers in the wind. A rustle in the leaves that always seemed to say my name. Then, it became more sinister. The earth trembled beneath my feet and the skies unleashed a torrential wrath of lightning.

But no matter how much they tried, I refused to worship them. They may have been the gods of Earth, but they weren't my gods. I had my own beliefs, a faith that was true to me, and nothing would change that.

The gods of Earth were furious with my defiance. They sent storms and earthquakes, but I stood my ground. I watched as the world around me crumbled and bowed before their wrath, and still, I refused to bow down to them.

Days turned to weeks, weeks turned to months, and months turned to years. Slowly but surely, the gods' fury subsided, and the world around me began to settle. They came to understand that they would never persuade me to worship them. They had to accept the fact that I was the only one who remained, and I was not to be swayed.

In the end, I was left alone on Earth, guarded by the gods, who knew better than to cross me. I had outlasted them all, and I had done it on my own terms. The world may have been empty, my life may have been a solitary one, but I knew that my beliefs had never wavered, and that was something worth holding onto.
