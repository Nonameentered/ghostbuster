A [TIFU] submitted by Santa Claus
As the world-renowned jolly man in red, I pride myself on my ability to bring joy and happiness to all those around me. But today, I truly fucked up.

It all started last Christmas when I was delivering presents to a home in a rural town. I met a lovely couple who had just been blessed with a beautiful baby girl. Over the year, I kept in touch with them, sending little gifts and checking in on how the baby was doing.

Fast forward to today and Iâ€™m in the throes of the holiday season, checking my list and getting ready to deliver presents. I came across the couple's name and was excited to give them something special. However, in all the excitement, I forgot to double-check their address.

As I approached the house, I immediately noticed something off. The house looked different, and there was no sign of the couple's car in the driveway. But being the confident man I am, I assumed they had redecorated and parked elsewhere.

I snuck into the home to deliver their presents, leaving them under a decorated tree in the living room. And that's when I heard voices. Not voices of joy but voices of confusion and fear. It was then that I realized my mistake.

I had stumbled into the wrong house.

Panic set in. I was in a stranger's house without permission, delivering presents to a family I didn't know. I quickly turned to leave, but not before I was caught by the homeowner. I tried to explain my actions, but my red suit and bag of presents only made me look more suspicious. The police were called, and I was taken in for questioning.

It took hours of explaining, and a few calls to the couple to prove my innocence. I had caused the occupants of the house so much distress and embarrassment. Not to mention, I could have been in serious trouble with the law.

It was a moment of the utmost humiliation for me as Santa Claus. I had failed to double-check my information and had made a grave mistake. These people were strangers, and I had terrified them.

I apologized profusely, but I know that the memory of a strange man invading their home on Christmas will be forever etched in their minds. I went home that night feeling guilty and ashamed.

From that day forward, I made a promise to myself to always double-check the addresses of the homes I visit. I never want to put anyone in a position of fear and uncertainty again. I learned my lesson in the most embarrassing way possible, and it's one I won't forget anytime soon.
