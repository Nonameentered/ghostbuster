The year is 2050 and you are the owner of the last internet cafe in the world. How did you manage to stay in buisness?
In the year 2050, the world had come a long way technologically speaking. Internet was everywhere, in people's homes, cars, and even on their person. It was hard for traditional internet cafes to keep up with the trend, but there was one cafe that still stood strong. It was owned by a diligent entrepreneur named John.

John had always been a tech-savvy person. When the internet had started taking over the world, he knew he had to get into the business. He started his cafe, knowing internet users would require a place to unwind, have a coffee, and browse the internet.

As technology evolved, John evolved with it. He installed the latest gadgets and provided the fastest internet possible. He also knew how to add a personal touch to the experience. His cafe was frequented by loyal customers who appreciated his attention to detail.

In the midst of all this, John also kept the cafe environment open, friendly, and welcoming. He knew that socializing is essential to human life, even in a highly digitized world like 2050.

So, John built his business on trust, quality service, and personal touch. And that's how he managed to stay in business while everyone else perished.
