You are a Genie. The last time someone let you out of your lamp was over 100 years ago. But today is a new day, and somebody finally rubbed the lamp! However, this man seems to be a member of a terrorist group called ISIS, so you get creative with how you grant his wishes.
It had been over a century since I had been released from my lamp. I had spent countless years trapped inside, waiting for someone to free me, and my hopes had dwindled with each passing year. But finally, the day came when someone rubbed the lamp, and I was free once again.

I emerged from the lamp in a puff of smoke, my large, blue form towering over the man who had released me. He looked at me in shock, and I could see fear and apprehension in his eyes. He was a member of a terrorist group called ISIS, and I could sense the hatred and violence that consumed him.

I had been trapped inside my lamp for so long that I had lost track of the world beyond. I had no knowledge of this group or their actions, but I could sense the evil that was their driving force. I knew that I had to be careful with this man, that his wishes could have catastrophic consequences if I granted them recklessly.

"So, I'm your genie," I said, my deep voice echoing in the small room. "I can grant you three wishes, but be warned, your wishes have consequences, so choose them wisely."

The man looked at me with a mix of fear and excitement. I could see that he was struggling with the weight of his decision, that he wanted to ask for something big and powerful, but he was afraid of the repercussions.

I waited patiently, watching him as he paced back and forth across the room. Finally, he stood in front of me, his eyes blazing with determination.

"My first wish," he said, his voice steady, "is for a weapon of mass destruction. Something that will bring this world to its knees, and prove the power of our cause."

I felt a chill run down my spine at his words. A weapon of mass destruction was not something I could grant lightly. The consequences of such an action would be catastrophic, and I knew that I could not allow it to happen.

I considered his wish carefully, thinking of ways that I could alter it to minimize the damage. It took all of my power and creativity to come up with a solution, but finally, I had an idea.

"Your wish is my command," I said, bowing my head. "I will grant you a weapon of mass destruction."

I snapped my fingers, and a large, black box appeared in front of the man. It was a bomb, but not just any bomb. This was a special bomb, one that would be activated by a code that only he knew.

"If you use this bomb, it will cause widespread destruction, killing innocent people and devastating entire communities. However, if you choose not to use it, it will become inert and harmless. It will be up to you to decide its fate."

The man looked at the bomb with a mix of awe and reverence. I knew that I had given him a powerful tool, but I also knew that I had given him a choice. The decision to use it or not was in his hands, and I could only hope that he would make the right one.

"My second wish," the man said, his eyes shining with anticipation, "is for a large sum of money. Enough to fund our cause for years to come, and provide for our soldiers and their families."

Money was an easy wish to grant. I snapped my fingers, and a pile of gold coins and jewels appeared at his feet. It was enough to last him a lifetime, and he looked at it with glee.

But I had one more trick up my sleeve. "I must warn you," I said, "that this money is cursed. It will bring you great wealth and prosperity, but it will also bring you great pain and suffering. Use it wisely, and remember that money cannot buy happiness."

The man scoffed at my warning, too taken in by the beauty of his newfound wealth. He scooped up the coins and jewels and stuffed them into his pockets, his eyes shining with greed.

"My final wish," he said, his voice full of triumph, "is for the destruction of our enemies. For their homes and cities to be destroyed, and their people to suffer as we have suffered."

This was the wish that I had been dreading. I knew that granting it would lead to untold destruction and death, that it would cause pain and suffering on a scale that was unimaginable. But I was a genie, and I had to grant his wish, no matter the cost.

I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, summoning all of my power and creativity. I knew that I had to be careful, to give him what he wanted without causing too much damage.

"Your wish is my command," I said, my voice steady. "I will grant you the destruction of your enemies."

I snapped my fingers, and the room shook with the force of my power. In an instant, the man was transported to the heart of his enemy's territory, surrounded by their army and their people.

But there was no violence, no destruction. Instead, I had transported him to a place of understanding and compassion. He saw the pain and suffering that his actions had caused, the families torn apart by his violence and hatred.

He looked at me, tears streaming down his face. "What have I done?" he whispered. "What have I become?"

I looked at him with compassion, knowing that he had been consumed by hatred and violence for too long. "You have the power to change," I said. "You have been given a choice, and it is up to you to make the right one."

The man nodded, his eyes full of determination. "I will make things right," he said. "I will use my power for good, to bring people together and to heal the wounds of this world."

With that, I disappeared back into my lamp, content in the knowledge that I had helped someone see the error of their ways. As a genie, it was my duty to grant wishes, but it was also my duty to guide and support those who sought my help. I knew that there would be many more people who would rub my lamp in the years to come, and I pledged to use my power to make a positive change in this world, one wish at a time.
