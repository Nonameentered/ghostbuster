It had been weeks since her last visitor, but the old lady didn’t seem to notice. Her mind had been slipping away from her for some time now, and every day was a blur. She didn’t always recognize the nurse who came in to check on her, but that hardly mattered. She was used to feeling alone, as if she was floating through a dream.

But today was different. Today, her family was coming to visit. She had been told that they were coming, but the words had flown past her like a gust of wind. Still, she could feel it in her bones – something was different.

The first of her family members to arrive was her granddaughter, who opened the door and stepped into the room with a smile on her face. The old lady turned her head towards the sound of the door opening, but the woman who entered the room was a stranger to her. She couldn’t voice the question that was in her mind – who are you? – so she just lay there, waiting for something to happen.

The granddaughter approached the bed and took the old lady’s hand in hers. She spoke softly, but the words didn’t make any sense to the old lady.

“It’s me, Grandma,” the granddaughter said. “Do you remember me?”

The old lady just stared at her, feeling the weight of confusion and frustration settling over her once again. She didn’t know who this woman was, but she knew that she was supposed to. Why couldn’t she put the pieces together?

The granddaughter talked to her for a while, telling her about her day and asking her questions. The old lady couldn’t follow the conversation, but she was grateful for the company. It was nice to have someone to talk to, even if she couldn’t understand what they were saying.

As the granddaughter was leaving, the old lady felt a pang of sadness rise up in her chest. She didn’t know why she felt sad – it was just a feeling, like the flutter of a bird’s wings in her heart.

The next visitor was her daughter, who sat down next to the old lady’s bed with tears in her eyes. The old lady didn’t understand why her daughter was upset, but she felt a deep sense of love for her. She could see that her daughter was in pain, and she longed to take that pain away.

They talked for a while, but the old lady couldn’t keep up with the conversation. Her mind was constantly slipping away from her, like sand through an hourglass. But she could feel her daughter’s love, even if she couldn’t understand the words that were being said.

As the day went on, more and more family members came to visit. Some of them she recognized, but others were strangers to her. It didn’t matter. The old lady was just grateful for the company.

As the last visitor left, the old lady lay there alone once more. But she wasn’t really alone. She could feel the love of her family surrounding her, even if she couldn’t remember their faces.

She closed her eyes and felt the flutter of wings in her chest once again. She didn’t know where she was going, but she knew that she wasn’t alone. She would always carry her family’s love with her, wherever she went.
