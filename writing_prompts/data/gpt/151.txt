- You deliver a pizza to the lock down ward of a mental institution. When you try to leave an orderly grabs you and says, 'Nice try, get back to your room.'
It was a typical Friday night for Tom, working at his local pizzeria. He had been delivering pizzas for the past two years in order to pay for his college education, and although it wasn't the most glamorous job, he enjoyed his work.

On this particular night, Tom was assigned to make a delivery to a mental institution on the other side of town. He had delivered pizzas to the institution before, but he was always extra cautious when dealing with patients who had mental illnesses.

As he arrived at the institution, Tom was greeted by a group of orderlies who were waiting outside to collect his pizza order. They were quick to take the pizzas off his hands and handed him a small slip of paper with the bill.

"Thanks," Tom said as he took the piece of paper, "Can I go now?"

The orderlies looked at each other before one of them spoke up, "Not so fast. We need you to take this pizza down to the lockdown ward."

Tom felt his stomach tighten as he heard the words "lockdown ward". He had only heard of patients being locked down in movies and TV shows, but he had never actually seen one in real life.

"Ummm, okay. Where is it?" he managed to ask.

The orderlies gave him directions and escorted him to the ward. As he walked down the hallway, Tom noticed the heavy metal doors with small windows. He could hear the faint sounds of screaming and moaning coming from behind the doors.

When he reached the lockdown ward, he saw that it was much different from the rest of the hospital. The walls were painted in a dull, lifeless grey, and the patients were all dressed in white gowns.

Tom made his way towards the nurse's station to deliver the pizza and collect payment. As he approached, he saw an orderly walking towards him.

"Hey, I'm here to deliver the pizza," Tom said as he gestured towards the box in his hands.

The orderly looked at him suspiciously before taking the pizza and setting it down on the counter.

"Thanks, you can go now," he said as he handed Tom the bill and gestured towards the door.

Tom started to make his way back towards the exit when the same orderly he had spoken to earlier grabbed him from behind.

"Nice try," the orderly said as he tightened his grip on Tom's arm, "Get back to your room."

Tom tried to resist, but the orderly's grip was too strong. He was dragged back towards the lockdown ward and thrown into a room that was small and dank.

"What's going on?" Tom asked as he tried to push himself off the ground.

"You're one of the patients," the orderly said coldly, "You've been here for a while."

Tom looked at him in disbelief. He couldn't believe what he was hearing. He tried to protest, but the orderly had already slammed the door shut and locked it from the outside.

The reality of the situation finally hit Tom, and he realized that he was trapped. He had seen the movies where patients were trapped in institutions before, but he never thought it would happen to him.

As the hours passed, Tom began to feel the weight of his situation. He was stuck in a small room, with no food or water, and no way to contact the outside world. He began to second-guess his own sanity, wondering if he really was one of the patients in the ward.

But as darkness fell, Tom's fear turned to determination. He decided that he wasn't going to let the orderlies keep him captive any longer. He began to search the room for anything that he could use to escape.

After a few minutes of searching, Tom found a small piece of metal that he could use to pick the lock on the door. It took several attempts, but eventually, he managed to open the door.

As he left the small room and made his way towards the exit, Tom noticed that the hallways were completely empty. He was able to make his way to the nurse's station and collect his belongings before making a break for the front door.

He dashed outside and ran as fast as he could to his car. When he finally reached it, he slumped into the driver's seat and locked the doors.

As he took a deep breath, Tom realized that he had narrowly escaped something that could have been much worse. But he couldn't shake off the feeling that something was not right about the entire situation.

As he drove back to the pizzeria, Tom couldn't help but wonder what would have happened if he hadn't managed to escape. He shuddered at the thought and felt grateful to be alive and well.

When he finally reached the pizzeria, Tom gave his boss a brief explanation of what happened. He was too shaken up to give him the full details of his ordeal.

Although he had made it out of the mental institution, Tom knew that the memories of what he had experienced would stay with him forever. He made a vow never to take his safety for granted again, and to always be cautious when it came to the welfare of others.
