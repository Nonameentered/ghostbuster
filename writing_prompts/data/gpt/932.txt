Mark had always been terrible at drawing. Every attempt had ended in a squiggly mess that barely resembled what he was trying to depict. So imagine his surprise when, after absentmindedly doodling during a long-haul flight, he realized that the crude drawing of a duck he had scrawled with a sharpie on a napkin had somehow come to life.

He stared at the tiny cartoon duck, which was now flapping its wings and quacking frantically. At first, he was excited – if he could make anything he drew come to life, the possibilities were endless! But then he started to worry. What if he accidentally drew something dangerous, like a monster or a bomb?

His nervous thoughts were interrupted by a commotion at the front of the plane. A group of bumbling paramilitary Irish republicans had managed to hijack the flight, and were now shouting and waving guns around. People were screaming and cowering in their seats.

Mark knew he had to act fast. He hastily drew a makeshift shield and sword, hoping they would come to life and be strong enough to protect him. As he watched, the napkin he had drawn on started to shimmer and glow, and the shield and sword materialized before his eyes.

Feeling a newfound sense of courage, Mark sprang from his seat and charged towards the hijackers. They jeered and laughed at him as he brandished his silly-looking weapons, but Mark knew he had one secret weapon they didn't expect – the power of his Sharpie.

With each stroke of his pen, he brought to life a swarm of angry bees, a gaggle of geese, and a pack of snarling dogs. The hijackers were quickly overwhelmed and subdued, and Mark emerged as the unlikely hero of the flight.

As he landed safely at his destination, Mark couldn't help but smile at the thought that, even though he was a terrible artist, he had found a way to use his newfound power for good. He knew he couldn't control what he drew or what came to life, but he felt reassured knowing that if he ever found himself in danger again, he could always count on his trusty Sharpie to save the day.
