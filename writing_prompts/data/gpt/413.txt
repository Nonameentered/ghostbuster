It was a beautiful day in April when Sarah received the phone call that would change everything. Her mother had been diagnosed with terminal cancer, and the doctors had given her only a few months to live. Devastated by the news, Sarah rushed back to her hometown to be by her mother's side. 

Over the next few weeks, Sarah watched as her mother's health continued to decline. Her once vibrant and energetic mother was now weak and frail, unable to do anything for herself. Sarah spent every moment she could by her mother's side, holding her hand, reading to her, and telling her how much she loved her. 

One evening, after spending hours at her mother's bedside, Sarah finally decided to go home for some rest. As she was leaving, her mother whispered something in her ear. "I'm scared, Sarah," she said. "I don't want to die." Sarah's heart broke into a million pieces. She didn't know how to comfort her mother, how to ease her fears. All she could do was promise to never leave her side. 

The next few days were a blur of tears and sadness. Sarah felt like she was living in a nightmare, unable to wake up. And just when she thought things couldn't get any worse, her mother took a turn for the worse. 

Sarah watched, helpless, as her mother struggled to breathe. She could see the fear in her mother's eyes, and it broke her heart. Sarah held her mother's hand, telling her how much she loved her, as her mother took her last breath. 

For days after her mother's death, Sarah did nothing but cry. She couldn't eat or sleep, couldn't bring herself to leave the house. Her world had come crashing down around her, and she didn't know how to pick up the pieces. 

But slowly, Sarah began to find comfort in the memories of her mother. She would look through old photo albums, laughing at the silly pictures of her mother from her youth. She would find solace in the notes and letters her mother had written over the years, telling her how proud she was of her daughter. And eventually, Sarah began to smile again, remembering all of the wonderful times she had shared with her mother. 

Months passed, and Sarah finally found the courage to leave her house and return to work. It was a difficult transition, but slowly, she began to find joy in her life again. She would think of her mother every day, and though it still hurt to think of her loss, she was grateful for the memories she had. 

One day, Sarah was walking home from work when she spotted something out of the corner of her eye. It was a small, white kitten, meowing pathetically. Sarah couldn't resist the little creature's cries, and before she knew it, the kitten was wrapped snugly in her arms. 

Sarah took the kitten home with her, and it didn't take long for the little creature to become a beloved part of her life. She named her Snowball, and the kitten brought an incredible amount of joy into Sarah's life. Snowball would curl up in Sarah's lap while they watched TV, and she would jump and play, chasing after toys and pouncing on shadows. 

Sarah found herself smiling more and more every day, thanks to Snowball's presence in her life. And though she would never forget her mother, she knew that the little kitten had somehow come into her life at just the right time. Snowball had given Sarah a reason to smile again, and in a strange way, she had helped to heal her broken heart. 

As Sarah watched Snowball playing one day, she felt tears pricking at her eyes. They weren't tears of sadness, but tears of joy and gratitude. She had been through one of the darkest times in her life, but now, thanks to Snowball, she was happy again. And as she hugged the little kitten close, she knew that somehow, her mother was looking down on her, happy to see her daughter smiling once more.
