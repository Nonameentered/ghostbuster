Growing up, Lily always felt different. She never fit in with her classmates and her parents didn’t understand why she couldn’t seem to do anything right. But then, when she turned thirteen, she found out why. She had a superpower. Unfortunately, it was a useless one.

Lily had the power to make flowers bloom with her touch. That was it. She couldn’t control it, it didn’t come with any special abilities or traits. It was just a dumb and useless power, and the government had made sure to keep tabs on her since they found out.

She wasn’t the only one, there were others like her, with equally pointless superpowers. There was John who could turn invisible, but only when no one was looking, and Sarah who could talk to animals, but only when they wanted to talk to her.

Together, they were the Unacclaimed, a group of people with useless powers who came together to share their experiences and support each other through the trials of being different.

The government had been monitoring the Unacclaimed, watching them to make sure they didn’t use their powers for harm. But they had also discovered something else. If two Unacclaimed made contact, their powers would combine to create something much more dangerous.

That’s why Lily was always careful. She didn’t want to accidentally run into another Unacclaimed and risk the safety of the world. She had accepted her fate, had learned to live with her useless power. But then, one day, everything changed.

Lily was walking through the park when she saw him. He was tall with dark hair and piercing blue eyes. He looked familiar, but she couldn’t place him. As she approached, she felt a strange energy coming from him. It was then that she realized he too was an Unacclaimed.

“Hi,” she said, extending her hand to introduce herself. “I’m Lily.”

He took her hand and she felt a jolt of electricity run through her body. It was then that she realized what his power was. He had the ability to create electricity with his touch.

He didn’t say much at first but as they walked through the park, they began to talk. His name was Marcus and his power, like hers, was useless. Together, they explored the park, watching as Lily’s touch made the flowers bloom and Marcus’s touch made the lights flicker.

For the first time in her life, Lily felt like she belonged. She wasn’t alone in her uselessness anymore. But then, as they walked, they noticed a group of men in black suits following them.

“They’ve been watching us,” Marcus whispered.

“I’ve been monitored my whole life,” Lily replied, “But why do they care about you?”

Marcus looked at her, his eyes softening. “I’ve been on the run for years. The government wants to capture me because they know what could happen if I come in contact with another Unacclaimed.”

Lily felt a wave of fear wash over her. They had to get away, they had to be careful, but before they could move, the men in black suits had surrounded them.

“Come with us,” one of them said, “We won’t hurt you.”

Lily and Marcus exchanged a look, knowing full well that they couldn’t trust them.

“Run,” Marcus said, grabbing her hand.

Together, they took off through the park, dodging trees and bushes as the men in black suits chased after them.

Lily could feel the warmth from Marcus’s hand spreading through her entire body. He was generating electricity as they ran, and it was giving them the extra burst of speed they needed to stay ahead of their pursuers.

They ran for what felt like hours until they came to a small clearing. Lily could hear the sound of a river nearby as she and Marcus collapsed on the ground, panting and sweating from the exertion.

“I can’t run anymore,” Lily said, struggling to catch her breath.

Marcus took her hand again, his touch sending shivers up her spine. “It’s okay. We’ll be safe here.”

But they weren’t. The men in black suits had found them, and this time, they weren’t taking any chances.

Lily and Marcus stood up, facing their pursuers. They held hands, the power of their contact growing stronger with each passing moment.

Suddenly, there was a blinding flash of light and a deafening sound as their powers combined. The ground began to shake beneath their feet as everything around them started to crumble.

“I’m sorry,” Marcus said, his voice barely audible over the chaos. “I never wanted to put you in danger.”

But it was too late. Together, they had created a force that could not be contained. They were Unacclaimed, but together, they were unstoppable.

The world would never be the same.
