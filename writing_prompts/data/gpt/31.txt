You dress up as the 'classic' reaper for a Halloween party -- black robe, toy scythe, all that jazz. Midway through the night, you hear a deep, dark voice in your head... 'I need a sick day, man, and you look like the perfect person to take my place... Your costume is almost perfect, after all.'
It was Halloween night, and I had dressed up as the classic reaper. I had spent the entire day preparing my costume, ensuring that every detail was in place. From the black robe to the toy scythe, everything was perfect. I had even painted my face white and black to look like a skeleton.

The Halloween party was in full swing when I arrived. People were dancing, drinking and having a great time. My friends and I joined in on the festivities, and I quickly became the center of attention with my fantastic costume.

Midway through the night, I heard a deep, dark voice in my head that sent a chill down my spine. It said, "I need a sick day, man, and you look like the perfect person to take my place... Your costume is almost perfect, after all." I was startled by what I had just heard, but something about it intrigued me.

As the night progressed, the voice continued to speak to me, subtly urging me to take its place. The more it spoke, the more convinced I became that I wanted to do it. The idea of being the reaper, even if just for one day, was too alluring to resist.

Finally, I made up my mind. I was going to take the place of the reaper for a day. I looked around the party, and my eyes rested on a young man who was drunk and on the verge of passing out. I walked up to him and touched his forehead with my scythe. In an instant, his body turned to dust, leaving behind just his clothes and a few empty bottles.

I knew that what I had just done was irreversible, but I felt exhilarated by the freedom that came with that decision. Nobody had seen what I had done, and nobody knew what I was up to.

The voice came back, congratulating me on my first reaping, and then it directed me towards my next target. I followed its instructions, and soon I was reaping souls left and right. I quickly realized that once I touched someone with my scythe, their soul was extracted, and their body turned to dust.

At first, I was hesitant to approach people, fearing that I might be recognized or caught. But the more I reaped, the more confident I became. The voice in my head guided me, and the reaping became an easy and effortless task.

As the night wore on, I reaped more and more souls, and my eyes began to blur with exhaustion. But I could not stop; I was fascinated by the power that came with being the reaper. I knew that I could not leave this freedom behind when it was over.

Finally, as the night came to an end, I approached the voice in my head and asked, "What happens when it's over? How do I go back to my life?"

The voice replied, "You can't go back. Once you become the reaper, you become the reaper for life. But that doesn't mean you have to abandon your human life. You can evoke the reaping only on certain occasions, when it becomes necessary."

I understood what the voice meant. I would have to balance my new role as the reaper with my day to day life. I would have to be discreet and only draw out my power when it was required.

As I left the party, I felt a fresh surge of energy coursing through my veins. I was now the reaper, the harbinger of death. My costume had turned into an actual robe, and the scythe was now a real one. I had stepped into a new world, and I knew that I would never be the same person again.
