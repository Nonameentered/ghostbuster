Once upon a time, there were seven princesses who lived in the magical world of Disney. Each of them had a unique story, but they all had one thing in common, their happy endings. They were all married to the princes they loved and lived in their castles happily ever after.

But something strange was happening. One day, the princesses started to feel suspicious about their perfect endings. They couldn't understand how they had overcome the obstacles they faced and managed to get their happy endings. It seemed too good to be true.

Aurora, also known as Sleeping Beauty, was the first to voice her concerns. She had been cursed by Maleficent and was only saved by Prince Phillip's true love's kiss. It seemed too easy to her. "How did a kiss break the curse? It just doesn't make sense," she said to her six friends.

The other princesses nodded in agreement. They started to question their stories, and the more they thought about it, the more ridiculous it all seemed.

Belle, for example, fell in love with the Beast and broke the curse that turned him into a prince. "How did I fall in love with a beast? It's not like he was a charming person at first glance. It all seems so forced," Belle argued.

Cinderella, who had been mistreated by her stepmother and stepsisters, agreed with Belle. "How could I have fallen in love with the prince so quickly? That's not how love works in real life," she said, shaking her head.

Snow White, who had escaped from the evil queen with the help of the seven dwarfs, interrupted. "Why did the prince feel the need to kiss me when I was in a coma? It's creepy if you think about it," she said, shuddering at the memory.

Ariel, who had given up her life as a mermaid to be with Eric, chimed in. "How did I learn to walk and talk so quickly? It's not like humans can just magically teach those things," she said, crossing her arms.

Jasmine, who had fallen in love with Aladdin and flown on a magic carpet ride with him, said, "How did Aladdin manage to talk to the genie without using one of his three wishes? It's all so suspicious."

The princesses looked at each other and realized they had been living in a fantasy world. They didn't want to admit it, but their stories were too good to be true. They knew they had to find out the truth behind their so-called happy endings.

They decided to ask the Fairy Godmother, who had granted Cinderella's wish to attend the ball and find her prince. She knew everything about magic, after all.

The Fairy Godmother listened to their concerns and smiled kindly at them. "Don't worry, my dear princesses. Your stories may seem too good to be true, but they're not. You were all given amazing gifts by the fairy world, and those gifts helped you overcome all the obstacles you faced."

She explained that each of them had a gift that they used to overcome their struggles. Aurora had her beauty, which made the prince fall in love with her. Belle had her intelligence, which helped her see the good in the Beast. Cinderella had her kindness, which won over her prince. Snow White had her generosity, which endeared her to all the animals in the forest. Ariel had her courage, which allowed her to take risks and be different. Jasmine had her wisdom, which helped her see past Aladdin's facade.

The princesses understood. They had all been given a chance to use their gifts, and that's why their stories had happy endings. They felt relieved that they weren't living in a fantasy world after all. They hugged each other, happy to have each other as friends.

From that day on, the princesses lived their lives knowing that their happy endings weren't just a matter of luck. They had all worked hard to get to where they were, and their gifts had helped them reach their goals. They were grateful for what they had and continued to cherish their friendships.

Their stories may have seemed too good to be true, but they were just stories - stories that had a little bit of magic, a little bit of luck, and a lot of heart.
