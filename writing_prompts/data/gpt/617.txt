I had always been hesitant to join my friends' favorite MMORPG. I had never been one for online gaming, preferring to stick to single-player games instead. It wasn't until my friends banded together and begged me to give it a try that I finally relented.

As I created my character, I noticed that the questions were becoming increasingly personal. They started off simple enough: name, gender, race, and class. But then the questions took a turn for the unexpected.

"What is your biggest fear?" One of the questions read.

I paused for a moment, pondering how this could be relevant to a video game character. But I pulled myself together and answered anyway.

As I continued through the questionnaire, the questions only grew more personal and probing. It felt like I was filling out a job application or a dating questionnaire, rather than just creating a character for a video game.

Despite my initial discomfort, I tried to put it out of my mind and focus on the game itself. I logged in and began exploring the virtual world with my friends. It was a lot of fun, and I could see why they were so obsessed with it.

But I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something unsettling about the game and the way it had probed so deeply into my personal life. I made a mental note to investigate further and to keep my wits about me as I played.
