Every Redditor seemingly overnight gained mutant powers. Those with the most upvotes have more powerful abilities whereas those with fewer upvotes have ridiculously useless powers. The world is about to change drastically.
It all started with a simple post on Reddit. “What if everyone on Reddit suddenly gained mutant powers?” The idea quickly gained traction and soon enough, thousands of people were discussing the potential outcome. Little did they know, their words were about to become a reality.

One night, without warning, every Redditor woke up with the ability to do something beyond human capability. Some had the power of flight, others possessed superhuman strength. Those with the most upvotes were the strongest of them all, while those with the least upvotes had the most useless powers. For instance, there were people who could make their finger glow, and others who could turn invisible, but only for a few seconds at a time.

The world was in chaos. People were using their newfound abilities to wreak havoc on society. The most powerful mutants created factions and began to take control of entire cities. They had the power to do whatever they wanted, and nobody could stop them. The government tried to intervene, but their efforts were futile.

In the midst of the chaos, there were those who used their powers for good. They protected the weak and defended the innocent. They formed alliances and worked together to bring some sense of order back to the world. These groups were often made up of those with less powerful abilities, but their hearts were in the right place.

As time passed, the world began to adjust to the mutants. There were those who couldn’t handle the new reality and went into hiding, but others embraced their abilities and learned to live with them. Society had to adapt as well. New laws were put in place to regulate mutant behavior, and schools were set up to teach young mutants how to use their powers responsibly.

Eventually, the novelty of mutant powers wore off, and life began to return to some sense of normalcy. However, there were still those who saw their abilities as a means to control others. These mutants continued to wreak havoc, and it was up to the heroes of the world to stop them.

The world had changed drastically, but it remained as unpredictable as ever. Nobody knew what the future held for the mutants, but one thing was for sure - they could never go back to the way things were before.
