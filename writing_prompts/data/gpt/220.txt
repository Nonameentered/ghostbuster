a serial killer who's been captured by the authorities. They ask you to recount your first kill....
As soon as I heard the news of the serial killer being captured, I was relieved. For years I had been stalked by this madman. He killed my friends, my acquaintances, and those who were closest to me. I was worried that I would also end up on his hit list.

I was asked to recount my first kill, and I hesitated. I didn't consider myself a killer. I was just doing what I had to do. It was self-defense.

It all started one night when I was walking back home from a party. I was alone, and the streets were empty. Suddenly, someone grabbed me from behind. I turned around, and it was a man. He tried to force himself on me, but I fought him. During the struggle, I took out my knife and stabbed him. I didn't mean to kill him, but he died on the spot.

After that incident, I was traumatized. I couldn't sleep at night, and I kept hearing his screams. I started carrying a knife with me everywhere I went. I felt like I had to defend myself.

A few weeks later, I heard about another woman who had been attacked by a serial killer. I knew it was the same man who had attacked me. I started following him, watching his every move. And then I decided to take matters into my own hands. I killed him.

I don't regret what I did. He deserved to die. And I'm glad that the authorities have caught the serial killer. They can put him away for good, and I can finally have some peace.
