You have an ability to see soul escorts, who appear when someone is going to die. You are on a bus when you see the bus filled with escorts.
As soon as Leah boarded the bus, she could see them. Soul escorts. The glowing outlines of figures that only she could see. They usually appeared alone, a precursor to someone passing on. But this time was different. As Leah took her seat, she realized that the bus was filled with them.

At first, she couldn't make out the individual figures, they all seemed to blend together in a sea of glowing light. But as she focused, she could see a few more clearly. A grandmotherly woman with kind eyes, a young man with a gentle smile, and a child, no more than five years old.

Leah breathed a sigh of relief when she saw that the escorts weren't crowding any one person in particular. But as the bus pulled away from the stop, she could see that they were all still there, still waiting.

Her mind raced with questions. Was there a natural disaster coming? A bus accident? Was their presence a warning to Leah?

As the bus stopped again, more people boarded, and Leah's heart sank as the escorts became more crowded. She watched as they swarmed around an elderly woman in the back of the bus. Leah couldn't bring herself to look at the woman's face, but she knew what their presence meant.

Suddenly, the bus swerved to avoid a large object in the street, and Leah braced herself against the seat in front of her. Panic took over as she saw that the driver had lost control and was headed straight towards a busy intersection.

Leah closed her eyes, waiting for the inevitable crash. But as the bus came to a stop, she opened them again. The escorts were gone.

It wasn't until much later, as Leah watched the news coverage of a fatal accident that she realized what she had witnessed. The bus driver had suffered a heart attack, losing control of the vehicle and causing a chain reaction accident that had killed several people.

But for Leah, the most remarkable aspect of the tragedy was that the escorts had appeared on the bus before it happened. Some had come to guide their loved ones into the afterlife, while others, like the grandmotherly woman and the young man with the gentle smile, had been there to offer comfort to the passengers in their final moments.

It was almost too much for Leah to process, but she couldn't deny what she had seen. And so, she vowed to never again take the presence of soul escorts for granted, and to always be grateful for the time she had with the people she loved.
