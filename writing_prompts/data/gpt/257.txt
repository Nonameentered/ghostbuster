As I took my last breath, I felt my body relax. I knew what was coming, the inevitable decline into the afterlife. I closed my eyes and let the darkness envelop me.

When I opened them again, I was in a strange place. It was a vast, flat expanse, with no discernible horizon. The skies above were a dull gray, as if a storm was brewing. It was neither hot nor cold, and there was a strange feeling of emptiness that pervaded the space.

“Where am I?” I whispered to myself.

“Welcome to the realm between Heaven and Hell,” a voice replied.

I turned around to see who had spoken, but there was no one there. The voice was oddly familiar, although I couldn’t quite place it.

“Who are you?” I asked into the void.

“I am your inner monologue,” the voice replied.

“My inner monologue?” I repeated incredulously.

“Yes,” the voice said. “I’m the voice inside your head that you’ve always had. I sound and think like you, but I am a separate entity from yourself.”

It was a lot to take in. I had always thought of my inner voice as simply a part of me, not a distinct entity with a mind of its own.

“And what is this place?” I asked.

“It’s the waiting room, so to speak,” the voice replied. “Everyone who dies comes here, to be judged and assigned a final destination.”

“And where do I go?” I asked.

“That’s up to me,” the voice replied. “I’m the one who decides which realm you will spend eternity in.”

I felt a stab of fear in my chest. What if my inner voice decided I wasn’t good enough for Heaven? What if it consigned me to an eternity in Hell?

“I don’t understand,” I said. “Why do you get to decide? Why not God?”

The voice chuckled, a sound that was both strange and familiar. “God created us in his image, and so he gave us the power to make our own decisions. You see, I am an extension of yourself, a manifestation of your deepest desires and fears. As such, I am uniquely qualified to make the decision about your final destination.”

I pondered this for a moment. It made a strange sort of sense, although it was difficult to accept that my inner monologue held such power over my fate.

“So, what does my destiny look like?” I asked hesitantly. “Am I headed for Heaven or Hell?”

The voice was silent for a moment, and I felt my heart race in my chest.

“It’s complicated,” the voice finally said. “You’ve done some good things in your life, but you’ve also made some missteps. Overall, you’ve been average, neither good nor bad.”

“But I’ve tried to be a good person,” I protested.

“I know,” the voice said. “But sometimes, trying just isn’t enough. You need to take action and do what’s right, even if it’s difficult or uncomfortable.”

I sighed, feeling a sense of regret wash over me. I knew that I could have done better, that I could have been more kind and compassionate.

“What can I do?” I asked. “To convince you to let me into Heaven?”

The voice was silent for a moment, as if pondering the question. Then, it spoke again, its tone softening.

“You can’t convince me,” it said. “But you can convince yourself. Look inside your heart and think about the good things you’ve done. Think about the people you’ve helped, the lives you’ve touched. And then, think about the times that you’ve fallen short, and how you can do better in the future.”

I closed my eyes and breathed deeply, taking in the voice’s words. I felt a sense of clarity wash over me, as if I finally understood what was really important in life.

“I understand,” I said. “Thank you for helping me see things clearly.”

The voice chuckled again. “You don’t have to thank me. I’m just a manifestation of your own mind, remember?”

I smiled, feeling a sense of peace as I let the thought wash over me. Suddenly, the gray skies above began to clear, and a bright light appeared on the horizon.

“Is that… Heaven?” I asked.

The voice nodded. “It’s time for you to move on. Remember what I’ve said, and always try to do what’s right. I’ll be watching.”

And with that, I felt myself being lifted upward, towards the light. As I soared higher and higher, I knew that I had made peace with my inner voice, and that I was ready for whatever awaited me in the next realm.
