As the last meal chef on death row, I had prepared hundreds of meals for condemned prisoners. But nothing had ever prepared me for the day I had to cook for the man who had killed my daughter.

I had heard about his crime from the news and knew that he was going to be executed soon. It made me sick to my stomach to even think about him, but I had to remain professional and cook his last meal.

I tried to keep my emotions in check as I prepared his meal. I went through my routine, checking and double-checking my ingredients, and making sure everything was cooked to perfection.

But as I stood over the stove, stirring the tomato sauce, I couldn't help but wonder how he could have done something so heinous. How could he have taken the life of an innocent person?

My daughter's face kept flashing before my eyes, and I tried to push the memories away as I continued cooking. But they kept creeping back into my mind.

When the meal was ready, I took a deep breath and walked into the execution chamber, carrying the tray with his last meal. I placed the plate in front of him and watched as he ate.

He never once looked at me or acknowledged me in any way. He simply ate his meal in silence.

As he finished his plate, I stood there, feeling numb. I had no words for him, no message to send, no feelings to express. I just couldn't bring myself to say anything.

Silently, he rose to his feet, and I stepped back. He looked at me for the first time and said, "You're the chef, right? Thank you for the meal." Then he was gone, dragged off to face his punishment.

I was glad that it was over. Glad that I didn't have to think about him anymore. But as I walked back to my kitchen, I knew that the memories of my daughter and her killer would be with me forever.

I wondered if he knew what he had done to me and my family. I wondered if he had any remorse for what he had done. I wondered if justice had been served.

But for now, all I could do was clean up after him and try to move on. Maybe one day, I could find closure and peace, but for now, I was simply the last meal chef on death row, trying to make it through another day.
