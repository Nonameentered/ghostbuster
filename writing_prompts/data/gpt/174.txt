A love letter is slipped under your door at your college. It would be cute, but it came from the closet door.
As a college student, my life was pretty busy. Papers to write, lectures to attend, and exams to study for. I didn't have time for a social life or dating. But one day, something strange happened. I found a letter on the floor of my dorm room. It was handwritten and addressed to me. I was a little surprised since I didn't have many friends, let alone admirers. But I was curious, so I opened it.

The letter started out sweet, almost poetic. "Dear Jessica, I don't know how to say this, but I have loved you from afar for a long time." My heart skipped a beat. Who could this be from? Was someone trying to play a joke on me? I kept reading, trying to decipher the mystery.

But as I got further into the letter, things took a strange turn. "I watch you sleep at night, and I know everything about you. Your habits, your routines, your secrets." I shuddered. Who would write something like this? Was I in danger?

I scanned the letter for any clues as to who might have written it, but there was nothing. No name, no signature, no address. Just a creepy love letter that made me feel like someone was watching me. I tried to shake it off and convince myself that it was just a prank, but I couldn't get the words out of my head.

The next few weeks were filled with paranoia and fear. Every time I walked down the hallway, I felt like someone was following me. Every time I entered my room, I checked under the bed and in the closet for intruders. It was exhausting and overwhelming, and I didn't know how to stop it.

One day, I decided to talk to my roommate, Emily, about it. She was shocked when I showed her the letter and read it out loud. "That's so creepy," she said, wide-eyed. "Do you think it's someone on our floor? Or maybe one of your classmates?"

I shook my head. "I have no idea. But whoever it is, they know where I live and they're watching me. I don't know how to make it stop."

We brainstormed a few ideas, but nothing seemed to work. I even thought about asking campus security for help, but I didn't want to make a big deal out of it. I just wanted the letter writer to leave me alone.

But then, one day, it all came to a head. I was sitting in my room, trying to focus on my textbook, when I heard a noise. It sounded like someone was moving around in my closet. I froze, my heart racing. I had to do something.

I crept over to the closet door and slowly opened it. And there it was - a tiny letter, addressed to me, tucked into the back of the closet. I reached for it and pulled it out, my hands shaking. As I unfolded the paper, I saw the familiar handwriting and felt a wave of relief wash over me. It was just a note from my ex-boyfriend, asking for another chance.

As I crumpled up the letter and tossed it in the trash, I realized how much power one piece of paper could hold. Love, fear, betrayal, hope - all of these emotions wrapped up into a few sentences. And even though the contents of the letter were harmless, they still had the power to put me on edge. From that day forward, I made a promise to myself to never take anyone's words for granted.
