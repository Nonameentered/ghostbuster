You have been a serial killer for 25 years, and the cops have no idea you exist. One day you wake up strapped to a table. You hear a voice say, 'I have been watching you for some time.'
I never intended to become a serial killer. It wasn't something I woke up one day and decided to do. It was just something that happened, like breathing. 

It started with a simple urge, a need to take control. I was always a shy and timid person, never really standing out in a crowd. But that all changed when I killed my first victim. It was a rush like I had never felt before. And from then on, I was addicted. 

I've been doing it for 25 years, killing innocent people and leaving no trace behind. I've never been caught, never even been suspected. I was good at what I did. 

That was until the day I woke up strapped to a table. I had no idea where I was, or how I got there. It was a dimly lit room, with concrete walls and a single light bulb hanging from the ceiling. 

I tried to move, but my restraints were too tight. Panic set in as I began to realize that I was in serious trouble. But I tried to stay calm, to think rationally. Maybe this was just a nightmare, or some sick joke. But then I heard a voice. 

"I have been watching you for some time," the voice said. It came from the shadows, so I couldn't see the origin of the sound. 

"Who are you?" I asked, my voice shaking. 

"That doesn't matter. What matters is what you've done," the voice replied. 

At that moment, I knew that I was caught. This was the end for me. 

"You've killed countless innocent people. You've destroyed families, robbed them of their loved ones. And for what? Just to satisfy your twisted desires?" 

I didn't know what to say. I was guilty, and they knew it. 

"But don't worry, you won't be punished. At least, not in the way you're thinking," the voice said. 

My heart sank as I realized that they weren't going to kill me. They were going to keep me alive, torture me. 

"You'll spend the rest of your life here, in this room. Trapped, alone, and with nothing but your thoughts to keep you company," the voice continued. "It's not the punishment you deserve, but it's the one I'll give you." 

And with that, the voice was gone, leaving me alone with my fear and guilt. 

Days turned into weeks, weeks turned into months. I lost track of time, not that it mattered. I had no way of keeping track of the days. 

The room was bare, except for the table I was strapped to and the single light bulb that never turned off. I had no food or water, but I didn't feel hungry or thirsty either. It was as if I was in a trance, my mind consumed by my thoughts and memories. 

I relived every kill, every moment of triumph and terror. I thought about the families I had destroyed, the lives I had taken. And for what? For nothing. I was a monster, a shell of a human being. 

But then something strange happened. I started to feel something I hadn't felt in years: remorse. I began to regret my actions, to wish I had never done what I had done. 

Days turned into weeks, and my remorse turned into acceptance. I knew that I deserved punishment, and this was it. This was my purgatory, my chance to atone for my sins. 

And then one day, the door to the room opened. I was blinded by the light flooding in, and I shielded my eyes with my hand. 

"You're free to go," a voice said. 

I was confused. I had expected to spend the rest of my life there, alone. 

"What do you mean? Why am I being released?" I asked. 

"That's not important. What's important is that you're free. And for what it's worth, I hope you use this opportunity to make amends," the voice said. 

As I left the room and stepped into the light, I felt a sense of calm wash over me. I knew that what I had done was unforgivable, but perhaps this was my chance to make things right. 

I had been a serial killer for 25 years, but I wasn't anymore. I was a man trying to make amends for his past, and maybe that was enough.
