It is the 5th year after the release of No Mans Sky. Hordes of aliens descend on Earth not to invade or make friends, but rather to beg for mercy and to stop sending our scouts known as 'Players' from destroying them.
It had been five years since the release of No Man's Sky - an immersive, open-world game that had taken the world by storm. Players could explore an endless universe, discovering new planets and interacting with the diverse alien species that inhabited them.

But something strange began to happen. Reports started coming in from all corners of the globe. Strange, otherworldly ships were descending from the sky, and their occupants weren't friendly.

Far from invading or making friends, these aliens were begging for mercy. They called themselves the Vortixians, and they were being hunted to extinction by the dreaded 'Players.'

Players were human scouts sent to explore new worlds and report back on their findings. They were equipped with advanced weapons and technology, and for the Vortixians, they were a fearsome and destructive force.

The Vortixians made their way to Earth, desperate to plead their case to the human race. They begged for mercy, to stop sending out the Players and destroying their homes and families.

Humanity was stunned by the sudden appearance of these beings, and the revelation that their actions in the game were having real-life consequences.

The governments of Earth took action, banning the game and calling for an end to the destruction of the Vortixians. Slowly, trust was built up between the two species, and a truce was agreed.

But the scars remained, and the Vortixians would always remember the years of suffering at the hands of humanity. As for the Players, they had lost their precious game, and the realization that their actions had real-life consequences would stay with them for the rest of their lives.
