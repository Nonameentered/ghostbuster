Your family is about halfway into a road trip. It appears as if the area around you is about to be struck by a nuclear warhead, ensuring your demise. The missile turns out to be a dud and your would-be last words make the rest of the car ride extremely awkward.
We were halfway through our road trip when all of a sudden, the sky turned gray, and the air felt heavy. Out of nowhere, we saw a missile coming our way. We were sure our end was near. I looked at my family, and I saw panic in their eyes. Our car screeched to a halt, and we prepared ourselves for the impact. 

But something strange happened. The missile exploded in mid-air. It was a dud. The relief was palpable, and we could feel it collectively. We all breathed a sigh of relief, and our heartbeats returned to normal. But then I realized something. I had almost died, and I hadn't said anything meaningful to my family. I decided to speak up.

"I just want to say that I love you all," I said.

And that was it. The silence that followed was deafening. I could feel my cheeks turn red. Why did I have to say something so corny? My parents and siblings were staring at me, as if I had grown a second head. I tried to laugh it off, but the rest of the car ride was extremely awkward. Next time, I'll keep my would-be last words to myself.
