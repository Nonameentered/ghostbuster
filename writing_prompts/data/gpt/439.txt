It was an unusual day for Alex as he woke up and found himself in a world that he had never seen before. Everything was vibrant and colorful, and he couldn't believe his eyes. As he walked through the streets, he realized that he was the only human in this place. The buildings, trees, and animals all seemed alive, and he could hear them talk.

Suddenly, he saw a figure walking towards him, and as it got closer, Alex could feel himself shaking with fear. The figure was tall, and its hair, beards, and clothes were made of fire. Within moments, Alex could see that the figure was a God; a powerful deity that had ruled this world for centuries. The God walked up to Alex and smiled at him. "Welcome to the land of the divine," the God said. "I am pleased to see a human in my land."

Alex was stunned by the God's presence, but he couldn't help but notice how kind and gentle the God was. The God invited Alex to have breakfast with him, and so they sat down at the grand table that had been set for them. The breakfast was lavish and included fruits, bread, and different kinds of meats.

Over breakfast, the God and Alex talked about everything, from the weather to the purpose of life. The more they talked, the more Alex felt a sense of calm and happiness wash over him. He could feel himself becoming closer to the God, and he began to understand the true nature of divinity.

After breakfast, the God showed Alex around his world, and Alex was amazed by everything he saw. The trees were tall, and their leaves sparkled like jewels. The animals were happy and content, and the water was crystal clear. As the day went on, Alex realized that the God was not just a deity but a protector and father to his people.

As the day came to an end, the God turned to Alex and said, "It's time for you to go back to your world now, Alex. But remember, despite our differences, we are all children of the universe." And with these words, Alex woke up in his bed, unsure if it was just a dream.

But something changed in Alex that day. He realized that there was more to life than he had ever imagined, and that there was an unseen force that connected everything in the universe. From that day on, Alex became a spiritual person, respecting everyone's beliefs and never forgetting the lesson he had learned from his breakfast with a god.
