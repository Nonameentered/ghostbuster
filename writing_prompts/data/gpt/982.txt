Jack had always been a quiet and reserved man. He had been working as an office clerk for the past decade. However, nobody at the office seemed to care about his existence. They didn't acknowledge him, and they seldom spoke to him. Jack wore dull and drab clothes, which failed to capture people's attention, but he didn't mind. He came, sat at his desk, and worked diligently. Jack was fine being in his little corner, living in a world that didn't bother him much. However, one day he noticed something strange; people had begun to walk through him.

Jack was confused; he thought he was a ghost. He tried to touch his colleagues, but they couldn't feel him. Jack mustered the courage to speak to his coworkers, but no one answered or even noticed him. He started to believe that he was a forgotten soul trapped in this lifeless world. He wondered what he had done wrong or if he had said something inappropriate.

Then one day, he had enough. He wanted to find out what was the root cause of his problem. Jack resolved to talk to his boss. She was a sharp and well-respected woman, and Jack felt confident in approaching her. The next morning Jack went to his boss's office. He knocked and awaited a response, but no answer came. Jack opened the door and walked into her office, but nobody noticed him. Jack was taken aback. It dawned on him that he wasn't a ghost, but merely a forgotten soul, living in the shadows.
