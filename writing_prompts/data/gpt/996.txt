I walked into the dimly lit gymnasium, feeling a mix of nerves and excitement. I was here for the Gang Fair, where representatives from various gangs would be present to try and recruit new members. It was the first step in joining a gang, much like attending colleges' open houses and information sessions.

The room was bustling with activity. Gang members and their representatives were all over, showing off their colors and handing out pamphlets. I glanced at the display tables, each adorned with banners, posters, and various merchandise. The Bloods had red all over their table and wore bandanas to match, while the Crips donned blue and had their gang symbol displayed prominently.

As I was walking towards a table, a member from the Latin Kings approached me. "Hey youngster, interested in joining a real brotherhood? We take care of our own," he said with a sly grin. "We even have connections out of state, if you're ever looking to make some money."

I couldn't help but feel intimidated by his presence. I quickly made my way to the next table, where the members of MS-13 were handing out brochures. They told me about how they were a "family", always looking out for each other. But their methods, which were extremely violent, did not sit well with me.

In the end, it was the representatives from The Black Guerrilla Family that caught my attention. They were smaller in number, but their message was the most meaningful. They were focused on rehabilitating those who had been incarcerated, and making a positive impact in their communities.

I left the fair with a newfound sense of direction. I had finally found the gang that was right for me, one that aligned with my values and beliefs.
