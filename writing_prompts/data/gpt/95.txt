Gary was feeling the pressure as he sat at his desk, staring at his screen. The email notification had popped up just as he was about to leave for the day, and it was from God Himself. Well, technically it was from one of His children, but Gary had been delegated the responsibility of answering prayers on His behalf. He never thought he would end up in this position, but he had been working as God's personal assistant for a few years now, and it was just one of the many hats he wore.

As he clicked on the email and read the prayer, he felt a wave of uncertainty wash over him. The prayer was from a man, Michael, who was struggling to make ends meet and was at risk of losing his home. He had prayed for financial assistance, but Gary knew that this wasn't one of the requests he could handle on his own. He needed God's guidance on this one.

Gary had total autonomy over answering prayers, but he often sought God's advice on the tougher requests. He knew how much Michael's home meant to him and his family, and he couldn't just dismiss it. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes, asking God for His help.

As he opened his eyes, an idea popped into his head. What if he reached out to some of the people in Michael's community and asked them to help out? Surely there were some kind-hearted individuals who would be willing to lend a hand. But before he acted on this thought, he wanted to make sure it was in line with God's will.

Gary got up from his desk and walked to the chapel in the building where he worked. He sat down and prayed for guidance. He asked God to show him the way forward, and to help Michael and his family in their time of need. He sat there for a few minutes, his mind quiet and still. And then, he heard a small voice.

"Go and do what you feel is right."

Gary opened his eyes, feeling a sense of peace wash over him. He knew what he had to do. He went back to his desk and typed up an email to Michael, letting him know that he was working on a solution to his problem. He then reached out to some community groups, churches, and charity organizations in Michael's neighborhood, explaining the situation and asking for their help. He received an overwhelming response. People wanted to help, they just needed to know what to do.

Gary arranged a community meeting at Michael's home and invited all those who had expressed interest in helping. The response was incredible. People showed up with food, clothing, and even checks. Michael was in tears as he saw the outpouring of support from his community.

Gary watched from the sidelines, feeling a sense of pride and gratitude. He knew that he had played a small role in bringing this community together, but he felt humbled by the generosity of those around him. It was a reminder that prayer wasn't just about asking for things, but about coming together in times of need.

As the night wore on and people started to filter out, Gary found himself alone with Michael. They sat on the front porch, sipping coffee and chatting about the events of the evening. Michael looked at Gary with gratitude in his eyes.

"I don't know how to thank you for what you've done," he said. "You've brought together a community that has been divided for too long. You've given us hope."

Gary smiled, feeling a sense of warmth spread through his chest. "It wasn't just me," he said. "It was everyone who showed up tonight. They are the ones who made a difference."

"But you were the one who brought us together," Michael said. "You had the idea, and you acted on it. You are a person of great faith and compassion, Gary. You have a gift for bringing people together."

Gary felt a lump form in his throat. He wasn't used to receiving praise, but it felt good. He realized that he had made a difference in Michael's life, and that was a gift in and of itself.

As he walked home that night, his mind buzzed with thoughts. He realized that prayer wasn't just about asking God for things, but about listening for His guidance and acting on it. He knew that he would encounter more difficult requests in the future, but he felt more confident than ever that he could handle them with God's help.

The next day, Gary received an email from Michael. It was short and sweet, but it brought tears to his eyes.

"Thank you for being an angel in my life," it read. "I will never forget what you did for me and my family."

Gary smiled, feeling a sense of joy spread through his heart. He knew that he had found his calling, and that he was exactly where God wanted him to be. He was His personal assistant, but he was also His messenger, His helper, His friend. He knew that he would always be there to answer prayers, no matter how difficult they may be. He knew that he would always have God's guidance and grace to guide him.

And so, Gary continued on his journey, answering prayers and bringing people together. He knew that it was a daunting task, but he also knew that he was never alone. For he had faith, and that was all he needed.
