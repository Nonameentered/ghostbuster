The clock ticked away at a steady pace, each movement of the second hand as precise as a ballerina's pirouette, its haunting chime echoing through the empty halls like a ghostly melody. The walls, adorned with peeling wallpaper, had lost their luster over the years, but the clock stood resolutely on the mantel, its brass body and glass face shining brightly in the dimly lit room. 

Every hour, its animated skull would screech, reminding those who still remained of the long day they had endured. They could hear the gears and the springs ticking and whirring beneath its white enamel dial as the hands of time continued their endless march. Its delicate pendulum would sway back and forth with almost hypnotic grace, bringing to mind the sway of a willow tree in a summer breeze.

And yet, for all its grandeur and apparent significance, the clock missed the one thing that truly mattered - the world-changing event that would happen when it reached midnight. Its chime would ring out like a clarion call, announcing the start of a new day, an opportunity for fresh beginnings and limitless possibilities. Its symphony of sound would forever be tied to the history-making moment when the world turned over a new leaf, and that mundane, ordinary clock would be etched into the annals of time as a bonafide hero.
