Once a god...
Once a god, Apollo was revered and worshipped by many. His beautiful golden hair and strong physique drew admiration from both mortals and immortals alike. He was the god of music, poetry, archery, and healing, and he used his powers to help humanity whenever he could.

But one day, Apollo fell in love with a mortal woman named Daphne. She was a beautiful nymph who loved to roam and experience the wonders of nature. Apollo pursued her relentlessly, but she always managed to evade him. One day, as Apollo closed in on Daphne, she called out to her father, the river god, for help. He transformed her into a tree, and she was forever rooted in the ground.

Apollo was heartbroken by the loss of his love. He blamed himself for not being able to protect her, and he withdrew from the world. He spent many years in solitude, mourning his loss. He stopped contributing to the world, no longer creating music and poetry, or providing healing to the sick.

The other gods noticed his decline and decided to intervene. They came to him and reminded him of his power and influence over humanity. They reminded him of all the good he had done and all the love he had inspired. Apollo slowly began to come out of his shell, but he was no longer the same god he used to be.

From then on, Apollo devoted himself to healing and became the god of medicine. He no longer pursued mortal women, instead focusing on helping the sick and the poor. He used his music and poetry to bring joy and comfort to those in need. He became a god of compassion, known for his empathy and care for humanity.

No longer a god of love and desire, Apollo became known as the healing god, a symbol of hope and comfort to all who knew him. Though he had lost his love, he had found new purpose in life, and he was content with his new role in the world.
