You travelled back in time to hit on someone. If you failed you travelled further back into their past and tried again. You finally succeeded and have stayed with them. Unfortunately as it stands, their future is filled with your previous attempts.
I always knew I was meant to be with her, but fate had other plans. In order to secure our future together, I had to travel back in time and make her fall in love with me. And if I failed, I would simply travel further back and try again. It was a risky plan, but I was willing to do whatever it took to be with her.

My first attempt was a disaster. I traveled back to the year 1970 and met her at a party. I tried to impress her with my knowledge of current events, but ended up sounding like a pompous know-it-all. She barely gave me a second glance before moving on to someone else. Disheartened, I traveled further back to 1960.

This time, I decided to take a different approach. I would be more laid back and let myself be charmed by her instead. I met her at a coffee shop and we hit it off right away. We talked for hours about music, books, and movies. I felt like things were going well and was about to ask her out when I accidentally mentioned a classic rock band that wouldn't form for another five years. She looked at me like I was crazy and quickly made her exit. I realized then that I needed to be more careful with what I said and how I acted.

I spent years jumping back and forth between various eras, trying my best to make a connection with her. Each attempt ended in heartbreak and disappointment. It seemed like I was destined to be alone, trapped in the past forever.

But then, one day, I traveled back to 1950. I met her at a diner and we hit it off immediately. We talked about old movies and the latest fashion trends. She was beautiful, witty, and charming. I found myself falling for her hard and fast. I knew that I couldn't mess this up.

Over the course of several weeks, we went on dates and got to know each other better. I made sure to be careful with my words and actions, knowing that a single slip-up could ruin everything. But things were going so well that I couldn't help but feel hopeful.

Then, one day, I woke up to find that I couldn't travel back through time anymore. I had succeeded in winning her heart, but at the cost of being stuck in 1950 with no way back to my own time. At first, I was devastated. But then I realized that I didn't mind being stuck in the past as long as I had her by my side.

We got married in 1951 and started a life together. We had kids and grandkids, grew old together, and enjoyed every moment of our time together. But as the years went on, I began to notice something strange. Every now and then, I would catch a glimpse of myself from a previous attempt. It was as if all of the failed attempts were still happening, just in a slightly different timeline.

At first, I tried to ignore it. But as time went on, I couldn't help but feel guilty. My attempts to alter the past had clearly had an impact on the future. How many timelines had I created where she was alone and unhappy?

I decided to confess everything to her. I told her about my time-traveling adventures and the various attempts I had made to win her heart. To my surprise, she wasn't angry or upset. Instead, she smiled and held my hand.

"That doesn't matter," she said. "What matters is that we're here now, together. And I wouldn't want it any other way."

Her forgiveness was a weight lifted off my shoulders. But the guilt still lingered. I knew that my attempts to change the past had created a future that was filled with endless possibilities, both good and bad. But as long as I had her by my side, I knew that we could face any future together.
