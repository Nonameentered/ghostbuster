You are walking down the path to your home when you notice a 'Glitch'.
As I walked down the familiar dirt path towards my home, I noticed something odd. A small glitch seemed to appear in the air as I walked past a tree. It was as if a small section of the world had flickered for just a second. 

I stopped and turned around, confused. The glitch hadn't reappeared, and everything seemed normal. I shrugged it off and continued on my way, chalking it up to my tired mind playing tricks on me. 

But as I walked, more glitches appeared. They were small and fleeting, like blips in the world around me. It was as if reality was flickering at the edges, and I couldn't help but feel a creeping sense of unease.

I ran the last few steps to my house and threw open the door. Inside, everything was normal. The living room was quiet, and the kitchen was empty. But as I approached the stairs, another glitch appeared. This one was much larger, and it lasted for several seconds. 

I felt as if the world around me had just stopped for a moment, and when it resumed, things weren't quite right. The walls of my house seemed to ripple, like the surface of water disturbed by a stone. I stumbled back, feeling lightheaded and dizzy. 

And then, as quickly as it had appeared, the glitch disappeared. The world around me settled back into its normal state, the walls no longer rippling like water. But I knew that something was wrong.

I decided to investigate further. I grabbed my phone and started recording as I walked around the house, looking for any other glitches. At first, everything seemed normal. But then I saw it - a glitch that lasted for several seconds, followed by another and another.

I watched as the world around me flickered and stuttered, like a poorly programmed video game. Reality itself seemed to be breaking down, and I couldn't help but wonder what was causing it.

As the glitches grew more frequent and intense, I felt a sense of growing panic. This couldn't be natural - something had to be causing it. Was it a malfunctioning piece of technology or something more sinister? I couldn't be sure.

I decided to call for help. I dialed 911 and explained what was happening, but the operator didn't seem to take me seriously. They told me to stay inside and wait for someone to come and investigage. But I knew I couldn't just sit around and wait for someone else to fix this. 

I continued to walk around the house, looking for any clues that might lead me to the source of the glitches. But even as I searched, the glitches grew more frequent and intense. Soon, they were happening every few seconds, and the world around me seemed to be growing more and more unstable.

And then, just as suddenly as they had started, the glitches stopped. The world around me settled back into its normal state, and I felt a sense of relief wash over me. But I knew that I had to find out what had caused them.

I decided to take matters into my own hands. If the authorities wouldn't help me, then I would have to investigate on my own. I grabbed a flashlight and headed outside, determined to find any clues that might lead me to the source of the glitches.

As I walked around the property, I noticed something odd. The air seemed to hum with a strange energy, and I felt goosebumps prickling along my skin. I shone the flashlight around, searching for any signs of a disturbance.

And that's when I saw it. A small device, hidden in the grass. It was some kind of emitter, and it had been causing the glitches all along. I reached down and picked it up, feeling a sense of satisfaction.

I had found the source of the problem, and now I could deal with it. I called 911 again, explaining what I had found. This time, the operator seemed more serious, and within minutes, a squad of police officers arrived.

They took the emitter away for analysis, and soon after, the news reported that a group of mischievous teenagers had been behind the glitching. Their plan had been to create a strange and confusing situation that they could record and post online, hoping to go viral.

I felt a sense of triumph at having solved the mystery, but also a sense of shame. The world had seemed to be breaking down around me, but it had been nothing more than a juvenile prank. 

Despite this, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief. The world was once again stable and predictable, and I knew that I could travel down the path to my home without any fear of glitches or malfunctions.
