The Sky is Green, it's been that way since they dropped the bomb.
The sky is green. It's been that way since they dropped the bomb. The world hasn't been the same since then. Humanity survived, but everything else changed.

When the bombs fell, a green haze covered the Earth. The sun was hidden behind thick clouds of radioactive dust. And the sky turned into this eerie green hue, casting everything in a sickly neon light.

Some say it's a warning sign, that the world is toxic and that we shouldn't be here. Others see it as the perfect way to hide from the rest of the world and create their own reality. But for most of us, it's just a constant reminder of what we've lost.

I remember the day they dropped the bomb like it was yesterday. I was in school, and we were just starting our history lesson. We heard the warning sirens and ran to our hiding places. We waited in the dark, silent for what felt like hours. And then, there was a bright flash of light, followed by a deafening boom. When we emerged, the world was changed forever.

The sky was green, and everything was coated in a thick layer of dust. The streets were empty, and everything was silent. We wandered around, confused and lost, not knowing what had happened. Eventually, we found others, people who were just as confused as we were.

The first few weeks were the hardest. There was no food, no water, and no way to communicate with the outside world. The few survivors banded together, staying in abandoned buildings and scavenging for supplies. People broke into stores and warehouses, taking what they needed to survive.

As time passed, the world started to recover. People started to farm and rebuild. The new world was different, but people adapted. We learned how to live off the land, how to protect ourselves from the elements, and how to make do with what we had. But the sky remained green, a constant reminder of what had happened.

The green hue cast everything in strange shadows. It was hard to tell what time of day it was without a watch. Nighttime merged with day, and the world was always in a constant state of twilight. It was unnerving, but we got used to it.

For me, the worst part of the new world was the silence. The world was quiet, too quiet. You could hear the sound of your own breathing and the rustling of leaves on the wind. But that was it. There were no animals, no birds, no insects. The world was silent, except for the occasional rumbling of the earth or the sound of the wind.

The silence was deafening, and it was a sign of what had been lost. The world was no longer alive, and it was a reflection of what had happened. The green sky was a constant reminder that the world was sick, and that it was our fault.

The first time I saw someone wearing a gas mask, I was terrified. It was a group of travelers passing through our town, and they had strange-looking masks covering their faces. They were scavengers, searching for supplies, and didn't stay long. But it was a wake-up call for us. We realized that the world was still dangerous, and that there were still things that could harm us.

That's when we started to rebuild. We built walls around our town, created a community where people could live together and work together. We started to farm and raise animals, looking for ways to sustain ourselves. Our small town became a beacon of hope, a place where people knew they could come and find a new home.

But the sky was still green, and for me, it was a sign of what we had lost. The old world was gone, replaced by something new and strange. But we had found a way to survive, and that was something to hold on to.

Now, years after the bombs came, the world is a different place. We have created new communities, new ways of living. We have rebuilt the world, but it is far from perfect. The green sky serves as a constant reminder of our past mistakes and our present triumphs.

We have found a way to survive, but at what cost? Our world is different, and it's hard to say if it's better or worse. But we have found a way to live, and for me, that's enough.

The sky is green, and it always will be. But now, we can look up at it and see the hope that we have created. We have survived a terrible calamity, and we have found a way to live in this strange new world. The future is uncertain, but we will face it together, under the green sky.
