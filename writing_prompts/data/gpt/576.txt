The secret she wished he'd never kept. (1hr)
Lila knew that something had been off with her husband, Will, ever since she saw him lay that jewelry box on her dresser. It was the same one she had been eyeing at the store for months, but she had no idea how he managed to afford it. She knew he had been working overtime at his tech job, but she didn't think it was enough to splurge on such an extravagant gift.

As the days went by, however, she couldn't shake off the feeling that something was wrong. Will was constantly on his phone, he would disappear for hours at a time, and he was always on edge whenever she tried to talk to him about it.

One day, she finally had enough and demanded that he tell her what was going on. It took some coaxing, but with tears streaming down his face, Will finally confessed the secret he had been keeping from her.

He had been fired from his job three months ago, but he had been too ashamed to tell her. He didn't want her to worry about the bills or think less of him for losing his job. So, he had been pretending to go to work every day, spending his days at the library studying coding, and freelancing at night to make ends meet.

Lila was shocked and angry. How could he keep something like that from her? How could he lie to her every day? The fact that he had been able to keep up the charade for so long made her question everything about their relationship.

She needed time to think, so she went to stay with her parents for a few days. During that time, she couldn't stop thinking about how she had been oblivious to the fact that her husband was in trouble. She couldn't help but feel like she had failed him as a wife and a partner.

When she returned home, Will was waiting for her with a bouquet of flowers and a letter. In the letter, he poured his heart out to her, telling her how sorry he was and how much he loved her. He promised to be more honest with her from then on and to work harder to make their lives better.

Lila knew that she loved Will and wanted to make their marriage work, but she couldn't shake off the feeling that there was more to his story. She began to investigate and found out that he had been fired because he had been caught stealing from the company. She was even more devastated that he had kept that from her.

She confronted him about it, and he broke down and admitted everything. He had been struggling with a gambling addiction for months, and he had started to steal from work to fuel his habit. He had been attending support groups and counseling, but he couldn't seem to stop.

Lila didn't know what to do. She loved her husband, but she couldn't condone what he had done. They went to counseling together and worked through their issues, but the trust between them had been shattered.

Years passed, and Lila and Will managed to make things work. Will had gotten a job at a startup and had been sober for years. Lila had forgiven him for his past mistakes, but the secret he had kept from her still nagged at her.

As they sat in their living room one evening, Lila turned to her husband and said, "I know you've been sober for years, but there's something I need to know. How much did you steal from your old job?"

Will's face fell, and Lila knew that she had hit a nerve. After a few moments of silence, Will finally spoke. "I'm sorry, Lila. I can't tell you that. It's something I wished we could move on from, and I don't want to bring it up again."

"But it's important," Lila replied. "You kept that secret from me for years, and it's something I need to know to move on from it."

Will took a deep breath and looked at his wife. "I didn't just steal a little bit, Lila. It was a lot. More than I can ever repay. But I promise you, I'll spend the rest of my life making it up to you and making things right."

Lila was stunned. She had no idea the extent of Will's theft, but she could see the pain in his eyes. She knew that he was sorry and that he had worked hard to make amends. She also knew that she still loved him, despite his past mistakes.

As they held each other, Lila realized that the secret her husband wished he had never kept was no longer a burden that they had to carry. It was a part of their past that they had learned from and grown from. And although they couldn't change the past, they could work together to build a better future.
