I know what you're thinking, but trust me, I'm not crazy. Let me explain.

When I was a child, I spent most of my time alone. My parents were always working and my siblings were much older than me, so I didn't have anyone to play with. It's not that I didn't want to make friends, I just didn't know how. So, instead of playing outside, I spent most of my time in my room, using my imagination to create a world of my own.

I started to notice that the more time I spent alone, the more vivid my imagination became. I would create entire cities with thousands of people and complex storylines. I became so invested in my own world that I would often forget where I was or what time it was. My parents started to get worried and would force me to interact with other kids, but it never felt right.

As I got older, my imagination only grew stronger. I would spend hours writing stories and drawing pictures of the people and places in my head. I even started to talk to them, as if they were real. It sounds crazy, I know, but to me, they were real. They were my friends, my family, my entire world.

As an adult, I still have my imaginary world. Except now, I use it as an escape from my mundane life. Whenever I'm feeling down or stressed, I retreat into my own mind and spend hours exploring the world I've created. Sometimes, I'll even act out scenes or have conversations with the characters in my head. It's like my own personal therapy.

I know it sounds insane, but it's the only thing that keeps me sane. My imaginary world is my safe haven, and I'll never let anyone take it away from me. It's a part of who I am, and if that makes me crazy, then so be it. But trust me when I say that I'm not crazy, I'm just a little different.
