As the wind whistled in his ears, Eagle Feather closed his eyes and concentrated on the time portal that would take him back to the first Thanksgiving. He had heard countless recounts of the event from his forefathers, and now he had the opportunity to witness this historic event first-hand.

Moments later, he found himself in a dense forest, surrounded by unfamiliar flora and fauna. But his keen senses told him that he was in the right place.

Eagle Feather stepped out of the hiding behind a large tree and observed the scene before him. He saw a large group of pilgrims sitting together, enjoying their meal. They were surrounded by Native Americans who had helped them through a harsh winter.

Eagle Feather was thrilled to experience this moment, to be a part of history, but he noticed that something was amiss. The pilgrims and Indians' mutual relationship was not that of a peaceful one, as he had heard. Their body language and hostility managed to reveal the unsaid tensions between them. The scene was quite different from what he had heard!

Eagle Feather was about to walk away when he heard someone in the crowd start sobbing. He followed the sound and saw a Native American woman crying inconsolably. He approached her and tried to comfort her, but she continued to cry, speaking in an unknown language.

Eagle Feather wished that he knew the language of her tribe, but he listened carefully to her voice. He realized that the woman was talking about her child's abduction. Eagle Feather sensed that this child stole by the Pilgrim's, but he had no proof.

Eagle Feather felt his ancestor's anger rising within him. How could they ignore the injustice happening right under their noses? He knew he had to do something, but how?

The pilgrims and Native Americans were still enjoying their meal as if nothing had happened. It was a sign of their peace and coexistence. But Eagle Feather knew that things would take a different course if he continued to remain silent.

As the sun began to set, Eagle Feather decided to take drastic measures. He sneaked into the pilgrim's settlement, searching for the missing child. His journey was arduous and tiring, but he didn't stop until he found the child's whereabouts. The child was a little girl, scared and confused in an unfamiliar world.

Eagle Feather picked up the girl and started heading back to the settlement. On his way back, the pilgrims caught him, seeing the girl in his arms and accused him of theft. But Eagle Feather explained the situation to them, speaking in words that only actions could do justice to.

The pilgrims understood the situation and apologized for their misdeeds. They even thanked Eagle Feather for his bravery in making things right.

As the night fell, Eagle Feather joined the other natives at the campfire. The woman whom Eagle Feather comforted earlier thanked him and revealed that the child was her daughter, Little Doe. She had feared for her child's safety and was grateful to Eagle Feather for bringing her home.

Eagle Feather realized that coexistence was not about agreeing on everything, but about standing up for what is right. He left the settlement with a heavy heart, happy that he could make a difference in a world so different from his own. Eagle Feather knew that he had not only witnessed history but had played an essential role in it.
