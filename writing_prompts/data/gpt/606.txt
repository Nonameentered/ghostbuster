You are kidnapped by a cult, and they are about to sacrifice you to their god. They don't know that you are that god.
As I was walking through the woods on my usual weekend hike, I suddenly felt a sharp pain in the back of my neck. From that moment on, everything went black. When I woke up, I found myself tied to a stake in the middle of a clearing. I could hear chanting behind me, and I knew right away that I was in trouble. I had been kidnapped by a cult, and they were preparing to sacrifice me to their god.

I tried to move my arms and legs, but the ropes were too tight. I shouted for help, but there was no one around to hear me. It seemed like my fate was sealed, and I was going to die.

But then something incredible happened. The cult members began to kneel down in front of me, calling my name as if I were some kind of god. I was confused and scared, but I realized that something strange was going on.

It was then that the leader of the cult stepped forward. He was an old man, with a long beard and a robe that was tattered and worn. He looked at me and said, "Welcome, our lord. We have been waiting for you."

I didn't know what to think. Had the cult members mistaken me for someone else? Or was this some kind of sick joke?

The cult members began to dance around me, waving their hands and chanting my name. They were holding knives and other sharp objects, and I knew that I was in grave danger.

Suddenly, the old man raised his hand, and the cult members fell silent. He turned to me and said, "We have been searching for you for years, my lord. We believed that you would come to us one day, and now you are here."

I shook my head in confusion. "I don't understand," I said. "Why do you think I'm your god?"

The old man smiled. "Because you are the one who has the power to bring us salvation," he said. "You are the one who can make our dreams come true."

I still didn't understand what he was talking about. But then I saw something that made my heart stop.

In the distance, I could see a giant creature rising up from the ground. It was a monstrosity, with tentacles and claws and eyes that shone like diamonds. The cult members fell to their knees in front of it, and I knew that this was the god they worshipped.

I looked back at the old man, and I saw that he was holding a knife in his hand. "It's time for the sacrifice," he said, and he began to approach me.

I knew that I had to act fast. I tried to break free from my ropes, but they were too strong. I closed my eyes and focused all my energy on the creature in the distance.

To my surprise, the creature began to shrink and fade away. The cult members looked up and saw that their god was disappearing before their very eyes. They were confused and scared.

I opened my eyes and saw that the old man was standing in front of me, his knife held high. But then he too began to fade away, until he was nothing more than a wisp of smoke.

I was free. I untied myself and ran through the woods as fast as I could. When I finally made it back to civilization, I collapsed on the ground and cried.

I had been kidnapped by a cult, and they had tried to sacrifice me to their god. But little did they know, I was that god. I had the power to save myself, and to save them too. But at what cost? I knew that I could never go back to that life again. I was a god, but I was also just a person.
