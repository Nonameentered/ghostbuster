You are told that you are about to enter a room with one person that wants to kill you, and two people who would do anything to save your life. Inside, you find your two best friends and your crush.
It was a dark and stormy night. I walked into the abandoned building, not knowing what was waiting for me inside. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up as I approached the door. I took a deep breath and opened it.

As I stepped inside, I saw two of my closest friends, Alex and Samantha. They looked at me wide-eyed and relieved. However, as soon as I turned to face them, they shook their heads and pointed to my left.

There, I saw my crush, Tyler, holding a knife. He looked at me with cold eyes. It was clear that he was the one who wanted to kill me.

At the same time, I noticed that Samantha had a gun hidden behind her back, while Alex had a first aid kit at his side. It was clear that they were the two who were willing to do anything to save my life.

The room was quiet for a few seconds as Tyler and I faced off. I was unsure of what to do. My heart was pounding as I tried to think of a way to get out of this situation alive. I knew I had to stay calm.

Tyler spoke first. "I've been waiting for this moment for a long time," he said. "You ruined my life when you rejected me. Now, I'm going to make you pay."

I felt sick to my stomach. Tyler had always been a little intense, but I never thought he would go this far. I tried to keep my voice steady as I spoke. "Tyler, please put down the knife. We can talk about this. There's no need for violence."

Tyler just laughed. "It's too late for that. It's time for you to die."

Suddenly, he started towards me with the knife. I froze, not knowing what to do. I looked to Alex and Samantha, hoping that they had a plan.

Alex stepped forward with the first aid kit in his hand. "Tyler, stop! We don't want anyone to get hurt. There's no need for violence here."

Tyler hesitated for a moment, and I saw a glimmer of uncertainty in his eyes. Samantha took this opportunity to step forward with the gun. She aimed it at Tyler and said, "Tyler, put down the knife or it's over for you."

Tyler looked between the three of us, uncertain of what to do. I saw a flash of fear in his eyes. I knew this was my chance to make a move.

I lunged forward and tackled Tyler to the ground. We struggled for a moment, but I managed to knock the knife out of his hand. Samantha quickly grabbed it and kept it out of reach.

Alex helped me get Tyler under control while Samantha called the police. The rest of the night was a blur. I remember seeing Tyler being taken away in handcuffs, and then being taken to the hospital for a few minor injuries I had sustained in the scuffle.

When I woke up the next morning, I was in my own bed. Alex and Samantha were by my side, and they had brought me breakfast. They looked relieved to see that I was okay.

I thanked them for saving my life. "I don't know what I would have done without you two," I said, tears in my eyes.

Alex smiled. "You don't have to thank us. We're just glad you're okay."

Samantha added, "We always knew you were special. We were willing to do whatever it takes to keep you safe."

It took me a while to process everything that had happened. It was a terrifying experience, but it had shown me just how much my friends cared about me.

As for Tyler, he was sentenced to a few years in prison for attempted murder. I never spoke to him again, and I never wanted to. He had shown me his true colors, and I knew that I couldn't trust him again.

In the end, I was grateful for my friends who had been willing to put themselves in harm's way to save me. I knew that I was lucky to have them in my life, and I made a promise to cherish them always.
