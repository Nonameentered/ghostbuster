The twisted and most evil thoughts you've had in life must be enacted upon you before you can enter Paradise. The price for admission is this final 'cleanse.'
I never thought much about my thoughts. Everyone has dark and twisted ideas from time to time, right? It’s just part of being human. But apparently, those thoughts were going to be the thing that kept me out of paradise.

That was the deal, at least. If I wanted to enter the pearly gates, I had to pay the price. The price was having every twisted and evil thought I’d ever had enacted upon me.

When I first heard about this, I didn’t think much of it. It couldn’t be that bad, right? I mean, sure, I’d had some questionable thoughts, but nothing that bad. Nothing that would keep me out of heaven.

But as the day approached, my anxiety grew. What if I’d forgotten about some truly evil thought I’d had? What if it was going to be worse than I thought?

The day finally came. I found myself standing in a plain white room, surrounded by strangers. We’d all been brought here for the same reason. The final cleanse.

I could hear screams coming from another room. The sound echoed through the walls, making my heart race. Suddenly, I didn’t feel so confident anymore. What if my thoughts were worse than their screams?

A man in a dark suit entered the room. He looked like the devil himself, with a twisted smile on his face. He explained to us what was going to happen. We’d be put through a series of trials, each one representing one of our evil thoughts.

“Don’t worry,” he said. “It won’t last forever. Just remember, once it’s over, you’ll be pure. You’ll be ready for paradise.”

I don’t think anyone believed him.

The first trial was easy enough. I was forced to watch a loved one die. It was heartbreaking, but I knew it wasn’t real. It was just a test.

The second trial was worse. I was put in a room with a person I’d harmed in the past. They were given free rein to do whatever they wanted to me. It was brutal. They hit me, they screamed at me, they made me relive what I’d done to them. I sobbed through the whole thing, wondering why I’d ever thought it was okay to hurt someone like that.

The third trial was the worst. I was put in a room with a child. The child was innocent and sweet, and I knew what was coming. I’d had a dark thought about this child before, something I’d never spoken aloud, but it was bad.

The child looked up at me with trusting eyes, and I felt sick. How could I have thought about hurting someone so innocent? This wasn’t me. I wasn’t this person.

But before I had a chance to do anything, the child smiled at me and said, “I forgive you.”

I broke down. I’d never felt so guilty in my life. But the words ‘I forgive you’ gave me a glimmer of hope. Maybe there was a way out of this. Maybe I wasn’t damned forever.

The fourth and final trial was the strangest. I was put in a room with a mirror. I looked at my reflection and felt a chill run down my spine.

My own face was twisted in a sick, evil grin. It was like looking at a completely different person. I didn’t recognize myself. But as I stared at the reflection, I felt a sense of clarity.

All of the bad things I’d ever done, all of the twisted thoughts I’d ever had, were part of me. But they didn’t define me. I was more than just my dark side.

When the trials were over, I found myself in a different world. It wasn’t paradise, but it was beautiful. The sky was a shade of blue I’d never seen before, and the leaves on the trees were the brightest green.

I looked around, trying to see if anyone else had made it through. Sure enough, the people from the white room were there too. We looked at each other, the unspoken bond of shared experience between us.

I was about to ask someone if they’d made it, too, when an angel appeared before us. It was unlike anything I’d ever seen. The angel was glowing, and its wings were made of light.

“Welcome,” the angel said. “You have passed the final cleanse. You are ready for paradise.”

I felt tears prick at my eyes. Paradise was real. And I’d made it.

The angel led us through a garden of flowers, each one more beautiful than the last. I felt lighter than air, like I could float away.

We finally arrived at the gates of paradise. They were made of gold, and they shone in the sunlight. I felt like I was about to burst with joy.

The angel turned to us and said, “You have all earned your place here. But remember, you are not perfect. You are human, and that means you will make mistakes. But that’s okay. As long as you strive to be good, you will always have a place here.”

With that, the angel opened the gates, and we stepped inside.

I don’t know what I was expecting paradise to be like, but it exceeded all my wildest dreams. There were rivers of crystal clear water, mountains that seemed to touch the sky, and animals that I’d never seen before.

But what truly blew me away were the people. They were from all different backgrounds and cultures, but they all had one thing in common. They were happy. Truly happy.

I knew then that this was where I belonged. And I would do anything to stay here.

As I walked through paradise, I made a promise to myself. I would never forget what I’d been through. I would never forget the darkness inside of me. But I would use that knowledge to be a better person.

And with that, I stepped forward into my new life, ready to embrace all that paradise had to offer.
