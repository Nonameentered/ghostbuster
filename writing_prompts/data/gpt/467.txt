The end of the world was coming. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse had been waiting for centuries to ride out and bring about the end of the world. But something strange happened. Death had gone missing. The other three Horsemen - War, Famine, and Pestilence - were beside themselves with worry. They knew they could not bring about the end of the world without their fourth brother.

Desperate to find a replacement, the three Horsemen searched high and low for a human that was capable of the cruel and sadistic deeds that Death was known for. They searched in all corners of the world and finally, they found the perfect candidate. His name was Jack, and he was a notorious serial killer, who had been locked up in prison for his heinous crimes.

The three Horsemen entered Jack's cell in the middle of the night. Jack looked up at them, his eyes widening in fear and confusion. He recognized the Horsemen from his nightmares. But instead of being afraid, he felt a strange sense of excitement coursing through his veins.

The Three Horsemen spoke to him in hushed whispers. They told him of Death's disappearance and what was required of him. Jack listened intently, hanging onto every word. The thought of being one of the Horsemen gave him a thrill that he had never experienced before.

The next day, Jack was let out of his cell by the Horsemen. They led him to a deserted wasteland, far away from civilization. They watched in satisfaction as he began to kill, his sadistic nature coming to the fore. War, Famine, and Pestilence were pleased with their choice. Jack was perfect for the job.

Weeks turned into months, and Jack became more and more proficient at his job. His eyes glowed with a manic energy as he rode alongside the three Horsemen, trampling over buildings, destroying cities, and killing millions. He reveled in the bloodshed and destruction, and it seemed that he had found his true calling in life.

However, Jack's reign of terror did not last long. The three Horsemen soon realized that Jack was not what they needed him to be. He was too eager, too bloodthirsty, and too unstable. They could not risk him turning on them and disrupting their plans to bring about the end of the world.

So, they concocted a plan to get rid of Jack. They lured him to a dark alleyway, where they ambushed him and sealed him inside another dimension. Without a replacement for Death, the Three Horsemen could not achieve their goal. They were forced to return to their own realm to await the emergence of a suitable candidate.

And so, the world continued as it had before, with the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse forever incomplete. As for Jack, he remained trapped in his own personal hell, a prisoner of his own sadistic desires.
