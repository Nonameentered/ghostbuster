In a world where mental health disorders are contagious, Emily tried her best to avoid people. She didn't want anyone to catch her anxiety and depression. She knew how debilitating it could be and wouldn't wish it on her worst enemy.

But despite her best efforts, she would often stumble upon someone with a mental disorder, and she could feel the toxic seeds of their illness take root in her mind. She would feel their panic attacks, their manic highs, and their suicidal thoughts engulf her own thinking. It was like an infection that would start small, but without treatment could turn into a full-blown disease, taking over her brain.

Eventually, Emily locked herself up in her apartment, refusing to leave unless necessary, and even then, she took every precaution. She never touched anyone, wore gloves, and a mask.

That's when scientists discovered the illness; they had no idea where it came from, but they quickly found ways to isolate the carriers and create treatments. It was a relief to know that you could be cured and nothing was permanently wrong with you.

Emily, like everyone else, underwent the treatments and  was living the best life she could. She hoped the research would mean that people like her could live free of worry and fears. No one deserved to be imprisoned and tormented by their mind.
