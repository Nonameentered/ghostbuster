I have known my time of death since the day I was born. It is a strange, premonition-like feeling that has always been a part of me. You could say that I have been living with the constant shadow of death looming over me since the very beginning. And yet, strangely enough, it doesn’t scare me. In fact, it has given me an odd kind of freedom to live my life to the fullest and take risks that I might not have otherwise taken.

I am always asked about it, of course. People are fascinated by the idea of knowing when and how they will die. But it’s not something I talk about much. It’s not that I’m afraid others might judge me or think I’m crazy, but it’s just that it’s hard to explain something that has always been a part of me.

It’s not like I have some kind of supernatural power to predict the future. It’s more like a sense that I have, a knowledge that I carry with me at all times. I can feel it in my bones, in the way that the hairs on my arms stand up, in the way that my heart races just a little bit faster than usual. And it’s always accompanied by a sense of calm.

It’s not that I’m not afraid of death. I am. But it’s more like I’ve made peace with it. It’s a part of life, and we all have to face it eventually. And knowing when my time will come has given me a sense of urgency to make the most of the time I have.

It’s led me to take risks, to say yes to opportunities that I might have otherwise ignored, to live in the moment because I know that I might not have another chance. I’ve traveled to places I never thought I’d go, jumped out of airplanes, gone bungee jumping, and taken chances on love.

And yet, for all that, I’ve never tried to change my fate. I’ve always known that it’s inevitable, and trying to fight it would be like trying to hold back the tide. But that doesn’t mean I’ve always been happy about it.

As I’ve gotten older, and my sense of impending doom has grown stronger, I’ve found myself becoming more and more anxious, wondering when it will happen, how it will happen, and whether I’m ready for it. But even in those moments of fear and uncertainty, I’ve tried to hold on to the sense of calm that has always accompanied my knowledge.

It’s funny, because even though I’ve never shared my secret with anyone, there have been times when people have seemed to sense something about me. Maybe it’s just my imagination, but sometimes I feel like they can see it in my eyes, or sense it in the way I carry myself.

It’s like I’m carrying a piece of knowledge that they can’t quite put their finger on. And in those moments, I feel a strange kind of connection to them, as if we’re sharing something profound without even realizing it.

As I sit here, now, in the twilight of my life, I can feel that sense of calm more strongly than ever. I know that my time is approaching, that I don’t have much longer to live. But I’m not afraid.

I’m grateful for the life that I’ve lived, for the moments of joy and love and adventure that I’ve experienced. And even though there have been moments of sadness and pain and loss, I wouldn’t change a thing.

Because even as I face the end, I know that my life has been a good one, full of meaning and purpose and joy. And in the end, that’s all that really matters.

So I wait, patiently, for my time to come, knowing that it’s just around the corner. And even as I take my last breath, I will be surrounded by that sense of calm, that knowledge that everything is as it should be, that I have lived my life well.

And in that moment, as I slip into the great unknown, I will smile, happy to have been alive, content in the knowledge that I have fulfilled my destiny.
