For years, Edward had been locked up in his apartment, spending countless hours on his computer, trying to find a formula that would prove the existence of God. He had become obsessed with the idea, working tirelessly day and night, barely eating or sleeping. His friends and family had grown concerned about his mental health, but Edward was convinced that he was on the brink of a breakthrough.

One day, after months of intense work, Edward finally believed that he had done it. He had found a mathematical equation that would prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that God existed. He was ecstatic, jumping up and down in his tiny apartment, shouting out his discovery for all the world to hear.

But then, something strange happened. Suddenly, the lights flickered, and there was a loud pounding at the door. Edward rushed to answer it, but when he opened it, he found no one there. He looked up and down the hallway, but there was no sign of anyone.

It was then that he heard a booming voice in his head, a voice that he knew belonged to God. "Edward," the voice said, "what you have discovered must not be made public. The world is not yet ready for this knowledge."

Edward was shocked and confused. How could this be? Wasn't it his duty as a mathematician to share his findings with the world, to help people understand the truth about God's existence? But the voice in his head was insistent, warning him that the consequences of sharing his discovery could be dire.

Edward was torn. He wanted to do the right thing, but he also felt that he had a responsibility as a scientist to share his findings. But then, the voice spoke once more. "Edward, do not worry. Your discovery will not go to waste. Trust me, it will be put to good use in due time."

And with that, the voice faded away, leaving Edward stunned and confused once more. He wasn't sure what to make of it all, but he knew one thing for certain: he could not ignore the message he had been given. He would have to keep his discovery to himself, for now at least.

Over the years, Edward continued to work on his formula, perfecting it and refining it in secret. He still felt a sense of frustration and sadness that he could not share his discovery with the world, but he trusted that God knew what he was doing. And then, one day, something miraculous happened.

Edward was sitting at his desk, staring at his computer screen, when he noticed something strange. The formula that he had been working on had changed, almost as if by magic. It was as if someone had come along and tweaked it, making it even more perfect than before.

And then, he heard the familiar voice in his head. "Well done, Edward. You have done what few others could. You have discovered the true nature of my existence. And now, I believe it is time for you to take your place in the world, to bring your findings to those who need them most."

And with that, Edward knew what he had to do. He gathered his things and stepped out into the world, ready to share his discovery with anyone who would listen. And as he spoke, people looked on in amazement, marveling at the beauty and majesty of God's existence, and the incredible mind of the mathematician who had discovered it all.
