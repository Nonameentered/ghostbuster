I was sitting on my porch, enjoying the warmth of the sun when suddenly a man ran into my yard. He was out of breath and his eyes were filled with terror.

"Please," he begged, "you have to hide me. They're after me!"

Without hesitation, I led him inside and hid him in the spare room. I didn't know who "they" were or what the man had done to warrant being hunted down, but I couldn't just stand by and let him be killed.

As I tried to calm the man down and figure out a plan, I heard a familiar voice outside. It was my best friend, Ben. But something was different. He had a weapon in his hand, and he was searching my yard.

"What's going on?" I asked him when he entered the house.

"There's a dangerous criminal on the loose," he said, his eyes darting around the room.

I hesitated for a moment before blurting out, "Ben, I think the man you're looking for is in my spare room."

Ben's eyes widened in surprise. He lowered his weapon and looked at me, confused.

"What are you talking about?" he asked.

I explained everything to him while the man in the spare room listened, fear still etched on his face. Ben was shocked but quickly composed himself.

"I'll take care of it," he said. "I'll make sure he gets to a safe place."

I watched as Ben left with the man, wondering how he could have been so blind to what was really happening. It was a reminder that sometimes the people we trust the most can be the ones who surprise us the most.
