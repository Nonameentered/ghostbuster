The Writer's Pavilion, or WP, was a thriving online community of writers from all over the world. It was a place for writers to share their ideas, seek feedback, and help each other improve their craft. The website had a feature that allowed users to vote on the best posts, and the top posts would make it to the front page.

Over time, it became clear that only about 0.5% of the decent WP posts actually made it to the front page. Everyone assumed it was just the algorithm being selective, until one day, a member noticed something alarming. One of the stories that had made it to the front page was identical to a post that they had seen on Reddit. Further investigation revealed that many of the top-rated posts on WP were almost identical to popular posts on Reddit.

It didn't take long for the WP community to come to the realization that major script writers and story houses were pilfering their ideas and using them to make ungodly amounts of money. The community was outraged. They had trusted WP as a place to share their ideas with like-minded writers, not as a breeding ground for Hollywood to steal their ideas.

In a real-life approach, the WP community banded together and came up with a plan to fight back. They first posted about their grievances on social media and other writing forums, gaining support from other writers around the world. They then contacted the media, hoping that their story would reach a wider audience.

The community also started spreading awareness about copyrights and intellectual property laws. They educated themselves about how to protect their ideas and raised awareness among others.

In addition, they started a petition on change.org demanding that scriptwriters and story houses give credit to the authors of these posts. The petition quickly garnered thousands of signatures, and the media started covering the story with more urgency.

The WP community became a force to be reckoned with. They were organized, passionate, and determined. They used every tool at their disposal to make their voices heard.

Their efforts paid off. After several months of outcry from the writing community, several major scriptwriters and story houses issued statements apologizing for their actions and pledging to properly credit authors in the future. It was a small victory, but it was a start.

The WP community continued to fight for their rights, though. They pushed for stronger copyright laws and better protection for writers' intellectual property. They made sure that their voices were heard and that their grievances were acknowledged.

In the end, the WP community's response to this crisis was a real-life approach to tackling a pressing problem. They showed that they could organize, educate and fight for their rights. They proved that they wouldn't be silenced or ignored. And most importantly, they showed that writers deserve respect and credit for their work.
