In the kingdom of the underground, there was a tale of a powerful entity who went by the name of The Cocaine God. It was whispered that he had the ability to create the purest form of cocaine, which would fetch unbelievable prices in the market.

Many had heard about him, but no one had seen him, for he hid behind his army of loyal minions. These minions did not work for money, but for the promise of being able to get their hands on the product before it even hit the market. They were fiercely loyal to The Cocaine God, and would do anything to protect him.

One day, a man named John stumbled upon the entry to God’s private underground laboratory. He was an up-and-coming drug dealer, and the prospect of getting his hands on God’s cocaine intrigued him. He could see the power and wealth that lay ahead if he could get his hands on the product.

John sneaked into the laboratory, and what he saw blew his mind. It was a massive underground lair filled with the purest form of cocaine he had ever seen. And there, right in front of him, stood the infamous Cocaine God.

The Cocaine God was a middle-aged man, with a rugged face and a sturdy build. He was dressed in a white suit and wore a fedora on his head. He looked nothing like the deity John had imagined him to be, but his aura of power and authority was unmistakable.

John revealed his intentions to The Cocaine God, and was received surprisingly well. The God offered John a chance at becoming one of his minions; a position coveted by many, and earned only through years of loyalty and brutal training.

John took up the offer eagerly and soon he was initiated into the ranks of the Cocaine God’s loyalists. He was trained in the art of producing the cocaine, and was given a small area to produce and sell on his own.

Over the years, John made a fortune selling The Cocaine God’s product. His business grew, and he became one of the most prominent names in the drug trade. John’s rise to power, however, was short-lived.

One day, government agents raided his warehouse, and what they found was enough to put John away for a long time. The Cocaine God was never found, but John knew that he had been completely duped by the god of the underworld, and that his future was now bleak at best.

John had learned that sometimes, the price of power is not worth the risk.
