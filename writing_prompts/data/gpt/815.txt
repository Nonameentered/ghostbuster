You are a peaceful alien, trying to contact Earth. They think an invasion is happening.
I am an alien, and I come in peace. My mission is to make contact with the inhabitants of Earth. I arrive in my spacecraft and make a soft landing near a hill. As soon as I step out of my ship, I see the beautiful planet of Earth. It is a peaceful planet with breathtaking views. However, the inhabitants of this planet seem to be terrified of my presence.

I must admit, I am not surprised. The images that they have portrayed of alien encounters are always depicted as an invasion or an attack. Hollywood and the media have portrayed us as violent beings who wish to destroy their planet and take over their world. This is far from the truth. I come from a peaceful planet in a distant galaxy. We wish only to make friends with other sentient life forms. We have been trying to connect with other planets for a long time, but our efforts have been in vain.

I had to make some calculations and adjustments to my ship to be able to communicate with the inhabitants of Earth. I wish to speak with their leaders and explain my mission. Unfortunately, that was a mistake that I did not anticipate. My ship was spotted by someone who mistook my arrival as a threat. Within a matter of minutes, there were helicopters and military vehicles swarming the area.

I kept trying to convey a peaceful intention, but they kept sending hostile messages. The inhabitants of Earth were alerted about my presence, and they were not happy. I was disheartened and confused about the reactions of the people towards me. I did not realize that the media had made them believe that aliens were evil beings who wanted to destroy their planet.

As the military was approaching me, I made a decision to come out of my spacecraft. I wanted to show them that I meant no harm. I had to use my antennae to communicate with them. It was not the best method, but it was all I had. I started by saying, “I come in peace. I am not here to harm you or your planet. I only wish to establish a friendly relationship with your species.”

The soldiers had their weapons drawn, and they were preparing to shoot me. My words did not seem to have any effect on them. I realized that their fear was so deep that they could not look beyond their perceptions. I had to do something to make them see that I was telling the truth.

I decided to demonstrate my powers to them. I showed them that I could levitate. To prove that I was not a threat, I chose a nearby object and carefully levitated it. It was a small rock that weighed less than a pound. It levitated for a few seconds, and then I placed it back on the ground.

When the soldiers saw what I could do, they lowered their weapons. They were no longer pointing their guns at me but still held them tightly in their hands. I tried to communicate with them using my antennae. It was a difficult process, but I managed to convey that I was friendly and meant no harm.

The leader of the military came forward, and we had a brief conversation. I explained my mission – to make contact with the Earthlings and establish a peaceful relationship. I told them that the people of my planet had heard about Earth and how it was a beautiful planet filled with friendly inhabitants. The leader was surprisingly calm and was listening to me intently.

After I finished speaking, the leader said, “We are sorry for our reaction. Our history has taught us to be wary of strangers. We thought you were here to invade us. I am glad that we can talk to you in peace.”

The leader then ordered his men to step back. They lowered their weapons and went back to their vehicles. The leader and I continued to talk. I shared with him some of the knowledge I had acquired in my travels. We discussed various topics ranging from the environment and technology to culture and food.

After a while, we came to a mutual understanding. The Earthlings were pleased to know that there were other intelligent life forms in the universe. I was happy to make new friends. I spent a few more hours on Earth, showing them my technology and bringing some plants from my planet as a gift.

As I took off, the leaders of Earth’s inhabitants waved me goodbye. I knew that I had made a start at building a peaceful relationship. I will continue to make overtures of friendship and do my best to make sure that Earth’s inhabitants understand that aliens are peaceful beings. I realize that there are many more people like me, and I hope that we keep trying to connect with each other.
