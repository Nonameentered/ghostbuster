An immortal trying to find a way to die to be reunited with Death- the immortal's love.
For centuries, Luna had roamed the earth, watching empires rise and fall. But she was tired of it all. She had loved Death, the only one who understood her, but Death had always been just out of reach. Luna could never die, no matter how much she longed for it.

So she began her search. She explored dark caves and trekked through dense jungles. She consulted shamans and sorcerers, hoping they would hold the key to her salvation. Yet despite her efforts, she remained eternal.

One day, as she sat watching the sunset, Luna heard a voice whisper, "You cannot run from me forever." She knew that voice - it was Death's. "I have been watching you, my love, and I understand your pain. But there is no way for you to be released from this curse. You will never find a way to die."

Luna's heart sank. She had been searching for centuries, but all her efforts had been in vain. She realized that all she ever wanted was to be reunited with Death - and in that moment, she felt his embrace. "I have always been with you," Death whispered. "You need not search any longer."

With that, Luna closed her eyes and allowed Death's love to envelop her, grateful for the chance to finally rest.
