In an alternate universe, marriage meant more than just a commitment to love one another till death do us part. It was literally a lifelong commitment, as when one partner dies, their spouse dropped dead immediately. This strange phenomenon had shaped the way people viewed love and marriage in this world, but for Luna and Samuel, it was just natural.

Luna and Samuel had first met when they were still kids; they grew up together in the same neighborhood, climbed trees, played tag, and fell for each other without realizing it. As they grew older, they became each other's confidants, and it was only a matter of time before they realized that they were madly in love with each other.

They got married when they were twenty-five, and it was a beautiful ceremony. They exchanged their vows under the stars, surrounded by their family and friends. As they said their "I do's," both of them felt an overwhelmingly strong connection between them, and they knew that they were truly meant to be together forever.

Years went by, and Luna and Samuel's love only grew stronger with each passing day. They had a beautiful life together filled with love, laughter, and happiness. They had two kids, and they raised them with warmth and kindness. They were each other's support system through thick and thin, always standing by each other no matter what.

As they grew old together, Luna and Samuel knew that their time on earth was limited. They often talked about what it would be like when one of them died, but they always reassured each other, knowing that they would go together when the time came.

One day, Samuel fell ill, and no matter what they did, he couldn't get better. Luna stayed by his side until his last breath, and as he passed away, she dropped dead immediately. It was an eerie sight to see, but to those who knew them and understood their love, it was a beautiful way to pass on to the next world.

Luna and Samuel were inseparable even in death, and they knew that they would be together again in the next world. Their love was timeless, and even in an alternate universe, it was as pure and powerful as ever.
