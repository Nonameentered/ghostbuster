The man groaned before he even fully opened his eyes. His head felt like it had been split open, and his back was sore all over. He tried to sit up, but found that he was lying on the cold concrete floor of a garage. He blinked his eyes a few times, trying to clear his vision as he looked around the room.

The garage was dim, with only a single light bulb flickering overhead. He could make out a car sitting in the corner, but what really caught his attention were the three bodies hanging from the ceiling. They were all men, dressed in suits and ties, but their faces were puffy and discolored. They were hanging from ropes that seemed to be straining under their weight.

As he tried to stand, he felt a tug at his throat. He reached up to find a fourth rope, the noose tight around his neck. He gasped, struggling to breathe, as he realized what this meant. He was next. He must have been knocked out and left for dead by whoever had done this horrible thing.

He looked around frantically, taking in all the details of the room. The door was on the far side, bolted shut with a thick padlock. The windows were too high to reach, and even if he could, they were barred. There was no way out of this place.

Panic set in, and the man began struggling with the rope around his neck. He tried to pull it off, but that only made it tighter. He tried to kick the bodies, hoping that he could dislodge one of the ropes and use it to escape, but they were too high up. He was completely trapped.

He slumped back down to the floor, tears streaming down his face as he silently prayed for a miracle. He didn't want to die like this, alone and forgotten in some dark garage. He wanted to live, to see his wife and children again, to go back to his normal life.

Suddenly, he heard a creaking sound. He looked up to see that one of the ropes was straining under the weight of the hanging body. The knot was coming loose.

With a loud snap, the rope broke, and the body fell to the floor with a sickening thud. The man recoiled, trying to push himself away, but he was too slow. The dead hand flopped across his face, brushing his skin with cold fingers.

That was when he saw the key. It was clutched tight in the dead man's fist, but it was there. He reached out, trying to pry the fingers apart, but they were stiff and unyielding.

He looked around the room again, his eyes landing on the car in the corner. He crawled over to it, using all his strength to stand up and lean against it. He kicked the tire, hoping to make enough noise to attract someone's attention.

The sound echoed through the room, bouncing off the walls and ceiling. He kicked it again, using all his pent-up frustration and rage. He screamed, hoping that someone, anyone, would hear him.

There was a jingling sound, and the man spun around just in time to see the key drop to the floor. He scrambled over to it, snatching it up before it could roll away. He held it up triumphantly, feeling new hope surging through him.

It took him several tries to get the key into the padlock, but eventually he managed it. The door swung open, and he was bathed in the bright sunlight beyond. He blinked, his eyes still adjusting to the sudden change.

He stumbled out of the garage, looking around for help. He was in an unfamiliar neighborhood, but he knew that he had to keep moving. He took a deep breath, taking his first steps into his new life. A life where he was no longer safe, no longer comfortable, but at least he was alive.
