I woke up in a place I couldn't recognize. The walls were white, the floors were cold, and the air was stale. Despite the fact that it was daytime, it seemed almost pitch black. I was confused and frightened. The last thing I remembered was going to sleep in my bed at home, but here I was; an insane asylum in the 1920s.

As I continued to explore the asylum, I began to realize that everyone in my wing claimed to have woken up here, but not from this time. No one seemed to have an explanation as to how they got here, but most were convinced that it was not the year 1920. Some even claimed to have come from the future.

The most mysterious one among them was a man who lay in bed and refused to talk to anyone. He was the first person ever accepted into the wing, and his presence had only fueled the rumors and theories about the asylum.

Each of us had a distinct personality and story to tell. There was a woman who said she was from the 1950s, but she couldn't remember how she ended up here. She had a kind demeanor and wore a floral patterned dress. There was a man wearing a tweed suit who said that he was from the 1930s. He had a distinguished and confident air about him, but he also looked uneasy and troubled.

I was determined to find out what was going on. I needed answers and I wanted to get out of this place. Over the course of several days, I spoke with everyone in my wing. While each had a different story, each one felt trapped in their own time.

One day, while trying to make sense of my surroundings, I stumbled upon a secret room. It was dark and crowded, and it was out of sight from the rest of the wing. The room was filled with dusty files and journals. I started to look through them, searching for anything that could lead to answers.

As I was reading through one of the journals, I heard footsteps approaching. My heart skipped a beat, but my curiosity took over, and I continued reading. Suddenly, the door creaked open, and I felt a cold hand on my shoulder.

"Who are you?" a voice asked.

I quickly turned around and saw a Nurse standing behind me. She was wearing a white uniform and had a stern look on her face.

"I'm a patient here," I replied, trying to remain composed.

"You shouldn't be here," she said, the hostility in her voice unmistakable. "You need to leave this room right away."

She walked with me out of the room and escorted me back to my wing. Once I was inside, I noticed that the other patients were looking at me with curiosity and concern. I knew I had to be careful from now on, but my desire to know what was happening in this asylum only grew stronger.

Days turned into weeks, and every day I went back to the secret room, trying to find some explanation or evidence of what was going on. The more I read, the more convinced I became that the medical treatments the patients were undergoing were not normal. They were being subjected to procedures that no one in this day and age would consider ethical, let alone humane.

One day, I was looking at a file that belonged to the man who lay in bed and refused to talk. That's when I found it. The document stated that he was a victim of dangerous and experimental drugs. The article claimed that the drugs could be used to enhance human mental faculties, but no one knew what the long-term effects would be.

As I read on, my heart began to race. There was a mention of a side effect that had emerged in some of the patients who had undergone the experimental treatment. These patients had become unstuck in time, slipping in and out of different timelines.

It suddenly became clear that the reason why all of us were in this place was that we were test subjects of this insane and unethical project. The patients had been gathered from different eras, from different times, and were being experimented on with dangerous drugs.

I knew I had to act. I had to get out of this place, and I had to tell the authorities. But, as I was leaving the secret room, I heard the footsteps of the Nurse again. This time, her tone was much more sympathetic.

"We need to talk," she said.

She took me to her office, and there she revealed that she was part of a secret group of nurses who had realized the true nature of the medical treatments that were being conducted in the asylum. They had been trying to put an end to this project for years, but they could not get through to the facility management or the doctors who were involved.

Before leaving the asylum, the nurses had made a plan to rescue the patients, one at a time, and to provide them with protection and support until they could be reintegrated into society. The man in the bed was their first success. They had been able to bring him back to his time, but he was so traumatized that he had stopped functioning.

The Nurse told me that they had been watching me, and that I had the potential to be their next success. They offered me a deal: They would help get me out of the asylum if I agreed to work with them and to help rescue the other patients. It was a risky and audacious plan, but it was also the only way we could escape this nightmare.

I agreed to their deal, and that night was the beginning of our journey. It was a journey filled with fear, uncertainty, and danger. But it was also a journey of hope, resilience, and bravery.

In the end, we were able to save all the patients from that wing, one by one. We smuggled them out of the asylum in quiet and controlled operations, with the support of the nurse's network of contacts and sympathizers.

I was the last one to be rescued, and I will never forget the feeling of walking out of that asylum for the last time. I felt as if I was reborn, and I knew that I had a mission to help the other patients who were still out there. I had to be their voice and their protector.

Now, seventy years have passed, and I am an old man. But I have never forgotten the asylum, and the people I met there. I often wonder what happened to them, and whether they ever managed to build a new life for themselves.

The only thing I can say with certainty is that they may have been lost in time, but they were never forgotten. They lived on within me and within the other people who fought to save them. And that knowledge is what makes me feel like I was a part of something bigger and more important than myself.
