It was just another typical day at the park when I stumbled upon a Ziploc bag lying on the ground. I picked it up, wondering what it could be. My curiosity got the better of me, and I opened it to find hundreds of small, clear pills.

At first, I had no idea what they were. But then it hit me like a ton of bricks. These were the NZT pills from the movie Limitless! I had seen that movie a dozen times, and the idea of being able to access 100% of my brain was always fascinating to me.

I didn't know how someone could have such a large quantity of these pills, but I suppose it didn't matter. What mattered was what I was going to do with them.

I decided to try them out, taking one of the pills and waiting for the effects. To my surprise, it didn't take long for my mind to clear up, and suddenly, everything around me became crystal clear. My senses were heightened, and my focus was laser-sharp.

I couldn't believe it. It was like I had unlocked a new level of consciousness. I felt invincible, like nothing could stop me. I started thinking about all the amazing things I could accomplish with this newfound mental prowess.

But then I started to worry. What if the pills ran out? What if I became dependent on them? Would I be able to function without them?

I decided to do some research on the drug and soon found out that the pills came with a whole host of dangerous side effects. That's when I realized it was time to get rid of them.

I flushed the pills down the toilet and never looked back. I learned that true intelligence doesn't come from a pill; it comes from the hard work and dedication that I put into my life every day.
