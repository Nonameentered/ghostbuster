I was sitting at my desk, typing away on my laptop, when I heard a faint rustling sound coming from my closet. I froze for a moment, wondering if I was just imagining things. But then I heard it again, and this time, I was sure someone was in my room.

I slowly got up from my chair and tiptoed towards the closet, trying not to make a sound. As I reached for the doorknob, I heard a piece of paper being slipped under the door. I hesitated for a moment, wondering if I should open the door and catch whoever was in there. But my curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to wait.

When I finally opened the door, there was no one there. But there was a note lying on the floor. I picked it up and read it, my heart racing as I did.

"Meet me at the abandoned house on 5th street, tonight at midnight. Come alone."

I didn't know what to make of it. Was it a prank? A setup? Or was it something more sinister? I decided to do some investigating on my own and set out towards the abandoned house.

When I arrived, I saw a figure standing in the shadows. I couldn't make out who it was, but I could feel my heart pounding in my chest as I approached.

As I got closer, the figure stepped forward, and I recognized the face. It was my ex-boyfriend, who I hadn't seen in years.

"I know it's strange to contact you like this," he said. "But I needed to see you. I have something important to tell you."

He pulled out a piece of paper and handed it to me. It was a letter, detailing all the reasons why he left me, and apologizing for the pain he caused.

Tears streamed down my face as I read the letter, and I realized in that moment that closure can come from the most unexpected places.
