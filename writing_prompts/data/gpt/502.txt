I woke up to a brand new power. I could clean anything simply by touching it. I was ecstatic!

I jumped out of bed, eager to test out my newfound abilities. I walked over to my dusty bookshelf and reached out to touch it. As soon as my fingers made contact, the shelves sparkled and the books gleamed as if they were new. I was amazed.

With my newfound power, I spent the entire day cleaning everything in sight. I dusted the lampshades, scrubbed the walls, and even polished the windows. Everything I touched became spotless within seconds.

However, as I was walking outside, I tripped and accidentally touched the ground. Suddenly, I felt a sudden jolt in my hand and realized that I had transferred my power into the earth. As I stood up, I noticed the ground before me was now barren and sterile.

I quickly realized that with my power, I could do more harm than good if I wasn't careful. From that day forward, I vowed to only use my powers for good and to never let them get out of hand.
