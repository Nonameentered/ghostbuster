The black slime moves quickly, coating the walls as I run. I can feel it chasing me, following me, slowly encroaching on my space until I am backed into a corner. It is then that I turn around to come face to face with a wall of the corrosive goo.

I am trapped.

The slime oozes closer, its ancient, malevolent energy making my skin crawl with fear. A single eye opens in its center, following me everywhere I turn, and then thousands more start to appear as tendrils slowly slither towards me.

They reach out and wrap around my limbs, pulling me closer and closer to the wall. It is too late for me to escape. The black slime has me now. I feel the cold, unforgiving embrace of the goo as it wraps itself around me, smothering me in its acidic slime.

I try to break free, to struggle against my bonds, but I am no match for its strength. The goo slowly starts eating away at my flesh, dissolving it in an instant. I scream out in pain, the sound echoing throughout the room.

And then, as quickly as it had begun, it was over. The black slime recedes back into the walls, leaving me a tangled and broken mess on the ground. I lie there, staring up at the ceiling, wondering how I could ever have ended up in this place.

I realize that all is lost as I look up and see another single eye in the center of that ceiling.
