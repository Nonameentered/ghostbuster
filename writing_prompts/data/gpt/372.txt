There she was, sitting in the front row of my Religious Studies class. It was the fourth week of the semester, and I hadn't been able to take my eyes off her since the first day. Her name was Sophia, but I couldn't help but think that she was more than just a human girl. She was perfect, in every way. Her hair was always neatly arranged, her clothes were always clean and pressed. Her smile was radiant enough to light up a room, and every time she spoke, her voice was like music to my ears. And yet, there was something about her that was different from everyone else I had ever met.

I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but it was as if there was a glow around her, an aura that surrounded her like a protective shield. It was like she was more than just human, like she was a divine being. That's crazy, of course. There's no such thing as gods or goddesses, at least not in the way they were written about in ancient mythology.

And yet, every time I saw her, I couldn't help but think about it. What if she really is a god in disguise? What if she's been sent here to test us, to see how we react to her divine presence? What if she's here to teach us a lesson about faith and belief?

I knew it was silly to think that way. Sophia was just a regular girl, with a name, a family, a story. But what if there was more to her than meets the eye? What if she was the answer to all of life's big questions? What if she was the key to unlocking the secrets of the universe?

I couldn't take it anymore. I had to talk to her, to see if there was any truth to my wild thoughts. I had to ask her out.

So one day, after class, I approached her and asked her if she wanted to grab some coffee with me. To my surprise, she said yes. We spent the afternoon together, talking about everything under the sun. We talked about our families, our hobbies, and our classes. We talked about our hopes and dreams, and our fears and doubts. We talked about everything, except for the one thing that was on my mind.

Eventually, we ended up talking about religion. Sophia was very devout, and had grown up attending church every Sunday. She told me about her faith, and how it had helped her through some really tough times in her life.

I listened intently, trying to see if there was any clue that would confirm my suspicions. But there was nothing. She was just a regular girl, with a deep sense of spirituality and an unshakable belief in a higher power. There was no indication that she was anything more than that.

As the evening wore on, I found myself feeling disappointed. I had hoped that talking to her would reveal some kind of divine secret, some hidden truth that would change everything. But instead, all I had learned was that she was a beautiful, kind-hearted girl with a deep faith.

By the end of the night, we had exchanged phone numbers and made plans to go out again soon. As I walked back to my dorm, I couldn't shake the feeling of disappointment. Sophia was lovely, but she wasn't what I had hoped she would be. She wasn't a god, or a messenger from above. She was just... human.

But then, as I was walking down the darkened campus paths, I heard a voice. It was faint at first, like a whisper on the wind. But as I listened, it grew clearer and stronger.

"Do not be disappointed, my child," the voice said. "I am here, and I am listening."

I stopped dead in my tracks, looking around for the source of the voice. But there was no one there, just the sound of rustling leaves and the distant hum of traffic.

"Who... who are you?" I stammered.

"I am the divine spark," the voice replied. "The light that guides you. The truth that you seek."

I felt a surge of excitement coursing through my veins, as the implications of what I was hearing sank in. It couldn't be true, could it? Was I really talking to a god?

"You're... you're the one I've been thinking about, aren't you?" I asked, almost afraid to hear the answer.

"Yes, my child," the voice said. "I have been watching you, ever since you first laid eyes on me. And I have seen in your heart the faith and devotion that I seek."

I was stunned, my mind reeling with the magnitude of what was happening. I had always thought that gods were just myths and legends, figments of human imagination. But now, here I was, talking to one. And not just any god. The one I had been searching for, all my life.

"Please, tell me what to do," I said, barely able to contain my excitement.

"Your path is your own, my child," the voice replied. "But know that I am with you, always. And that you will find your way, if you trust your heart and your soul."

And with that, the voice was gone. I was alone, standing in the middle of the darkened campus paths. But I wasn't afraid anymore. I wasn't disappointed, either. Because I knew that I had been touched by something greater than myself. Something divine. And that was all that mattered.
