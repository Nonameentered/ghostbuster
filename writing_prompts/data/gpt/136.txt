Ever since I inherited the magical camera from my grandfather, I had been fascinated by its ability to show me the value of objects around me. A ring would glow as bright as the sun, while a piece of plastic wrapping would almost be invisible. I had never used it to look at people, knowing that it would reveal their true worth and I didn't want to be judgmental. 

One day, while at a street fair, I accidentally glanced at a woman passing by. The camera showed me that she was worth more than anything I had ever seen, her value shining so bright it made my eyes water. I was stunned and couldn't believe that I had just witnessed something so powerful. From that day on, I decided to use the camera to help me see people's worth, which allowed me to understand and appreciate them in a way I never had before. Life was truly magical with the camera in my hands.
