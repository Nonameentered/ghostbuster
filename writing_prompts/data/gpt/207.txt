Maggie had always loved writing. She found it therapeutic and thoroughly enjoyed the creative process. But lately, something strange had been happening. None of her fellow writers were responding to any of her writing prompts. Not a single comment or like. It left her feeling frustrated and lost.

Maggie tried to shake off the feeling. She tried to remember why she had started writing in the first place. But no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't ignore the emptiness she felt inside. She missed the support and feedback that she had grown accustomed to receiving.

One day, while sitting at her desk staring at a blank page, Maggie realized that she shouldn't give up just because of a few silent days. She needed to push through and keep writing. Because at the end of the day, writing wasn't about pleasing others, it was about expressing herself and enjoying the process. And that was all the motivation she needed to keep going.
