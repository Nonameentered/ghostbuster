It was a beautiful sunny day, and Lily couldn't be happier. She had just landed her dream job and was walking down the streets of the city, enjoying the warm breeze, and the sound of the chirping birds. She was lost in her thoughts when suddenly she saw him. There he was, standing across the street. Even from a distance, she thought he was the most handsome man she had ever seen. And she couldn't take her eyes off of him.

He saw her too and immediately crossed the street, walking confidently towards her. He smiled, revealing a perfect set of teeth. Lily's heart was racing, and she was feeling a flutter in her stomach. He reached out his hand and said, "Hi, I'm Alex." She shook his hand, and something clicked. It was love at first sight.

They talked for hours, forgetting about the world around them. Alex was charming, funny, and a great listener. Lily felt like she had known him forever. They laughed a lot, and it was like they were in their world. Time flew, and before they knew it, the sun was setting.

As it got darker, they realized they should probably part ways. Alex said, "I had a great time. Can I see you again?" "Yes," Lily said, her heart beating faster. "It would be great." They exchanged phone numbers and hugged.

Lily smiled as she walked home that night. She felt like she was floating on a cloud. She couldn't wait to see Alex again. But little did she know, their next interaction would not be so pleasant.

The following week, they met again for dinner at a fancy restaurant. But as soon as they sat down, things started to go wrong. They both had completely different interests and opinions. They couldn't agree on anything. Every time Lily would say something, Alex would contradict it, and vice versa. It was like they were trying to one-up each other, trying to prove who was smarter.

Lily became increasingly frustrated. She liked Alex, but she couldn't stand his arrogance. He was not the charming guy she had met a week ago. He was judgmental, and it felt like he was criticizing her every move. It was like he was trying to make her feel small.

The conversation became awkward, and there were long moments of silence. Lily couldn't wait to finish dinner and go home. But halfway through the meal, Alex received a phone call and had to leave.

After Alex left, Lily sat there, alone, wondering what had just happened. She had gone from being smitten to realizing she didn't want to see him again. She thought about their interaction and realized they had nothing in common. She also realized that she had been trying to impress him the whole time, and that was not who she wanted to be.

Days went by, and Lily hadn't heard from Alex. Part of her was relieved, but part of her was disappointed. She still liked him, even though she didn't like how he had behaved during the dinner. Then, one day, she received a message from him. He apologized for his behavior and said he wanted to see her again.

Lily decided to give him another chance. They met for coffee, and this time, the conversation was different. They both apologized for their behavior, and it felt like a fresh start. But she still couldn't shake off the feeling that they weren't meant to be together.

As they said their goodbyes, Alex leaned in for a kiss. Lily pulled back, and that was when they both realized it. They were not made for each other. It was the last time they ever saw each other.

Lily learned that love at first sight doesn't always lead to happily ever after. Sometimes, you realize that the person you thought was perfect for you is not right at all. And that's okay. It's better to move on than to stay with the wrong person. And sometimes, people are better off as strangers than as lovers.
