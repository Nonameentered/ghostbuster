A Starbucks Batista has given you Double Chocolaty Chip Crème Frappuccino with soy instead of a Caffè Vanilla Light Frappuccino with no fat milk. Make this as tragic, heart-wrenching and miserable as possible.
I walked into Starbucks on a typically dreary Monday morning and ordered my usual Caffè Vanilla Light Frappuccino with no-fat milk. As I waited, I scrolled through my phone, hoping for a message from my ex-boyfriend, who had been dodging my calls for weeks. But instead of a notification, I heard my name called out.

I turned to see the smiling barista holding out a tall, icy Double Chocolaty Chip Crème Frappuccino with soy. My heart dropped, sinking like the Titanic, as I realized she had made a mistake, a mistake that would change the course of my life forever.

I mustered my courage to speak. "I'm sorry, I ordered a Caffè Vanilla Light Frappuccino with no-fat milk?"

She smiled still and apologized for the confusion. I couldn't help but study her hands as she redid my order. Her wrists, which I noticed, were covered in bracelets and scar tissue.

Unbeknownst to me, the barista had switched the milk and the order line was confused as they passed it down. Suddenly, the frappuccino mistakenly given to me was the one intended for a milk-intolerant customer. With each sip I took, I felt my throat constricting and my heart racing.

I ended up collapsing in the middle of the coffee shop, and a heartbreaking tragedy appeared. 

I was rushed to the hospital, where it was discovered that I was deathly allergic to soy. The frappuccino had sent me into anaphylactic shock, causing irreversible damage to my body. My ex-boyfriend finally called, but it was too late, as I was taken off life support the same day. 

To this day, I cannot help but associate Starbucks with the most sorrowful and miserable day of my life.
