Four years ago, I watched her as she stepped into the portal. She was confident and determined, her eyes shining with hope and excitement. I wondered what adventure awaited her on the other side. I had always known that she would be the one to be chosen, the one to embark on a journey that was anything but ordinary. 

Since the day she disappeared, I had waited. I waited every day, longing for her to come back, to tell me everything that she had seen and experienced. Every time I heard a door creak or a gust of wind, I hoped it was her stepping back into my world. But that day had never come. My hopes had been crushed as I realized that maybe she would never come back.

Then one day, she stepped out of the portal. I gasped, staring at her in disbelief. The girl who stood before me looked like a shadow of her former self. She was haggard, scared, and above all, defeated. I could see the trauma etched into her face. Her eyes lacked the spark that I had come to associate with her. I could feel the fear emanating from her, and it shook me to the core.

I hesitated before running to her, worried that I would startle her or cause her more distress. But instead, she came to me, enfolding me in a tight embrace. I could feel the tears soaking into my shirt, as she held onto me tightly, as if she didn't want to let go. I stroked her hair gently, whispering words of encouragement and comfort.

When she finally pulled away, she looked at me with a mixture of sadness and guilt. The words that came out of her mouth stunned me. "I'm sorry," she whispered brokenly.

I could feel my heart pounding heavily in my chest, and my throat was dry. I wanted to ask her what she was sorry for, but the words wouldn't come out of my mouth. Instead, I just held onto her, trying to impart some strength through my embrace.

She finally stepped away, and I could see the same determination that had been in her eyes when she first walked into that portal. But it was now tinged with something darker. Fear, loss, and sorrow.

My friend began to tell me her story; of the world she had gone into, of the dangers they had to face, of the people she had met, and most of all, of how she had lost everything. In that other world, she had lost all that she had held dear, and it had left her feeling shattered.

I listened, my heart aching with every word she spoke. How could the journey that had started with such hope and excitement have ended up this way? I wanted to chase away all of her fears and make everything okay again, but I knew deep down that it was impossible. I could not take her pain away, no matter how much I wished I could.

As she finished telling her story, she looked at me with a sad smile. "I never thought I would be able to come back," she said. "But then I realized that I couldn't just quit. I had to come back and try to pick up the pieces, try to rebuild what was lost."

I could see the determination in her eyes and knew that she would find a way to get through this. But at the same time, I could still see the fear and the sadness that haunted her every step.

From that day on, we took things one step at a time. Slowly but surely, my friend began to find her feet again. She would often look off into the distance, lost in thought, but with each passing day, her eyes would gain a little more brightness, and the smile that tugged at her lips grew a little more genuine.

As we went through this process of healing, I realized that our friendship had changed. I had always thought of her as being invincible, the one who would charge ahead, fearless in the face of danger. But in these trying times, I understood that she was human, that she could hurt and feel lost just like any of us.

The girl who had stepped into that portal might have been fearless and adventurous, but the one who had come back was so much more. She was brave, resilient, and strong in ways that I had never thought possible. She taught me that hope is not something that is lost forever, that even the darkest of situations can have a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel.

We never talked about what had happened in her journey again. But that was okay, because some things are not meant to be talked about. They are meant to be felt and understood on a level that defies conversation. 

Years passed, and our friendship continued to evolve into something deeper and more meaningful. And even though she had gone through a journey that was anything but ordinary, she remained my closest friend, the one who had taught me what it means to be brave in the face of adversity.
