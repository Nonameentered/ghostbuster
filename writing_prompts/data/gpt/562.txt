You have a superpower that let's you 'smell' what a person is like. For example, good hearted people smell good like vanilla, and a bad person would smell something like a public bathroom. One day, you meet someone who doesn't smell like anything.
Ever since I was ten, I had been blessed (or cursed) with a superpower that allowed me to smell what a person was like. It was magical, and I had grown up believing that everyone had this ability. It was not until I was fifteen that I discovered that I was the only one who could sense the smell of character traits in people. The sweet aroma of vanilla meant that a person had a good heart while the pungent smell of a public bathroom was an indication that they were up to something terrible.

Growing up, I had used my power to make friends and stay away from bad people. It had helped me to gain a sense of security, especially since the other kids in my school had always been cruel to me. By sniffing around, I could always find a friend or two who would offer much-needed support.

As I grew older, my superpower grew stronger. Now, I could smell not just the traits of good and bad people, but also their intentions. It was incredible - each person had their unique scent which would tell me what they were planning to do. I could even detect their emotions and what they had been feeling. It was like having a superpower that was a combination of intuition, empathy, and telepathy.

However, one day, something strange happened. As I was walking down the street with my friend, I started to smell a strange scent. It was nothing like anything I had ever detected before. I went in for a second sniff, but the scent was gone. It was like there was nothing to smell, as if the person who was emitting the scent didn't have any particular scent.

I was worried. I had never encountered someone who did not have any scent before. For me, this meant that I could not read them. It was like they were a blank slate, with no intentions, no emotions, no character traits, and no scent. I had no idea how to approach such a person, and soon my anxiety levels skyrocketed.

However, as much as I wanted to avoid this person, I felt drawn to them. There was an invisible string that tugged at me, urging me to go closer. As I made my way to them, I could feel my heart beating faster with each step. That was when I bumped into them.

"Oops, sorry about that," the person said, turning to face me.

It was then that I saw them. They were a tall, lean figure, with piercing green eyes and a warm smile. I looked at them, and yet, I still couldn't detect any scent. It was as if they were a phantom - something that was there, and yet not there.

I smiled, slightly embarrassed that I had bumped into them. "It's okay. I wasn't looking where I was going," I said.

The person chuckled and extended their hand. "Hi, I'm Alex," they said.

I shook their hand and instantly felt a chill run down my spine. It was like I had been transported to another dimension. There was a surge of electricity that zapped me, and I felt something shift within me. I was enticed and entranced.

It was as if Alex had no scent because they were so pure. They had no hidden intentions, no motives, no secrets, and no ulterior motives. They were just real, wholesome, and authentic.

I had never met anyone like them before.

As I stared into Alex's eyes, I knew that I had found my new friend. They seemed to be the missing piece of my puzzle, the person that I had been searching for.

As we talked, I couldn't help but wonder - what sort of superhero power had Alex been given?
