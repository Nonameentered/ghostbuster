I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the envelope. It was addressed to me, but there was no return address. All it said on the front was "He survived" in messy handwriting. I felt a shiver run down my spine as I tore open the seal and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper.

The writing on the paper was just as messy as the handwriting on the envelope. It was a letter, but there was no greeting or signature. The writer had simply written four words on the page: "I found your son."

I felt my heart stop. My son had gone missing six months ago, and I had long given up hope of ever seeing him again. The police had searched for him, but their efforts had yielded no results. I had resigned myself to the fact that my son was gone forever.

But now, here was a letter claiming that he had survived. I read the words over and over again, trying to make sense of them. Was this some kind of sick joke? A cruel prank by someone who knew about my son's disappearance?

I decided to investigate the letter further. I checked the envelope for any clues, but there was nothing I could find. I decided to visit the police station to show them the letter and see if they could help me track down the writer.

The police officer I spoke to was skeptical at first, but when I showed him the letter, his expression changed. He took the letter from me and examined it closely, muttering to himself. He then asked me a series of questions about my son, trying to gather as much information as possible.

After a few minutes of intense questioning, the officer sighed and looked at me gravely. "I'm sorry, ma'am," he said. "But I don't think there's much we can do at this point. The letter gives us no leads, and we have no way of knowing if it's even legitimate."

I felt a lump form in my throat. I had been so hopeful that I would find some answers, but instead, I was left with even more questions. Was my son really alive? Was someone trying to give me false hope? I couldn't bear the uncertainty.

That night, I lay in bed, unable to sleep. I kept replaying the words of the letter in my head, trying to extract some meaning from them. But the more I thought about it, the more confused I became.

Eventually, I drifted off to sleep, but my dreams were haunted by images of my missing son. I woke up in a cold sweat, feeling more desperate than ever. I knew that I had to do something if I was ever going to find my son.

So I decided to take matters into my own hands. I plastered posters of my son all over the city, offering a reward for any information leading to his safe return. I also put ads in the local newspaper and on social media, hoping that someone would see them and come forward.

Weeks turned into months, but I never gave up. Finally, after nearly a year of searching, I received a phone call from a woman who claimed to have seen my son. She said that he had been living on the streets, but that she had helped him get back on his feet.

I rushed to the address that she had given me, my heart pounding with excitement and fear. And there he was, standing on the front porch, looking thinner and wearier than I had ever seen him. But he was alive. And he had survived.
