As the newly appointed head of NASA, I found myself in a precarious position. I've been tasked with maintaining one of the biggest secrets known to mankind. Our planet Earth is flat. Yes, you heard it right, and no, this is not a joke.

The previous president of the United States was aware of this fact, which was kept a secret for so long. However, with every new presidential transition comes a new set of challenges, and this one was no different. I found myself sitting across from the newly elected President, trying to explain why the flat Earth theory was not common knowledge.

“Sir, when you were briefed about NASA, you were told about our space exploration programs, our vision for the future, and groundbreaking technologies we are creating to search for life beyond our planet. However, there is an aspect of NASA’s work that no one ever speaks of - the flat Earth theory.”

The President looked at me with bewilderment.

“Son, what are you talking about? I thought the Earth was round? Have you lost your mind?”

“Mr. President, the Earth is indeed flat. It has been this way for centuries, and only a handful of people know about it. The reason we keep it secret is that the majority of the population cannot handle the truth. The idea of the Earth being flat goes against all that we have been taught.”

I could see that he was still confused. I decided to explain more thoroughly, and so I went on to explain the history of the flat Earth theory. I explained how people’s long-held belief that the Earth was flat was disproved by Greek mathematician Eratosthenes, who used math to establish the Earth's actual shape. This belief was reaffirmed years later by NASA's photos of Earth from space, but again, our agency has always kept the flat Earth theory under wraps.

Why is the truth about the Earth so secret? The answer is simple: the public is not ready to hear it, and there could be disastrous consequences if it was made known to the world.

“The reason we kept it secret, Mr. President, is to prevent chaos. If we went public with this fact, religious, political, and scientific establishments would collapse. Imagine the hysteria, fear, and confusion that would ensue if people knew that NASA had lied to them for decades. It would be catastrophic, to say the least.”

The President stared at me for a moment before nodding his head in agreement.

“That's a fair point,” he said slowly. “But how will we keep this information from getting out?”

“We will continue to keep it secretly guarded. NASA has a team of brilliant scientists, and maintaining this secret is of utmost importance. We will continue to employ the strictest measures and protocols to ensure that this information remains hidden.”

The President sighed and leaned back in his chair.

“I understand the gravity of the situation and the reasoning behind keeping it secret. However, I hope that with time, we can find a way to make this truth known to the world without creating a catastrophic global event.

Maintaining such a big secret is not an easy task. It comes with its own set of challenges - from keeping the team that knows about the flat Earth theory under close surveillance, monitoring and controlling access to this information, to minimizing the possibility of leaks, it has never been an easy task. However, for the sake of our world’s peace, stability, and sanity, it's something we have to do.
