I woke up one morning and felt quite odd,
I opened my mouth, but rhymes were all I could laud.
I tried to speak normally but found it quite tough,
For every word that came out had to rhyme with "stuff."

I made my way to work with a feeling of dread,
How would I explain this curse that was now in my head?
My boss looked at me like I was quite insane,
As I tried to explain, "I'm sorry, I can only speak in refrains."

He scratched his head and looked quite perplexed,
I could tell that this rhyming had him quite vexed.
I tried to assure him that it would all be fine,
But I knew deep down that I'd had too much wine.

My spouse was next and I knew she'd be mad,
I tried to explain, but my words just sounded bad.
She looked at me and said, "What the heck did you do?"
I hung my head in shame, knowing this curse was long overdue.

I went to class feeling like a fool,
Rhyming every word sounded like a cruel tool.
But as the day went on, I began to see,
That rhyming wasn't so bad, it was sort of fun and free.

So if you're ever cursed with this rhyming curse,
Don't worry too much, you'll soon adjust.
