The world of Pokémon was not as bright and cheery as some liked to believe. The battles were vicious, and trainers were willing to do anything to ensure their win. The cities were full of corruption, with officials pocketing bribes from the criminal organizations that ran rampant. Pokémon were not companions, but tools used for profit and status.

Rotten corpses of Pokémon littered the outskirts of towns, victims to illegal battles. It was said that some trainers even had their own personal killing grounds, where they would dispose of any Pokémon that failed them.

The criminal organization Team Rocket was at the forefront of the corruption. They would steal rare Pokémon and experiment on them until they were nothing but mindless weapons. The streets were ruled by their gang members, making it impossible for anyone to speak out against them. They would silence any dissenters through any means necessary.

But there was a glimmer of hope. A small group of trainers formed a resistance against this darkness. They fought for the rights of Pokémon and the downfall of Team Rocket. They may have been few in number, but they were determined to bring light to this gritty world.
