Throughout history, humans have always been aware of the existence of good and evil. Many people believe that the devil, a malevolent being, exists as the embodiment of evil. The devil has always been known to stay in his hellish realm, except for once every year, which he uses to take a human body for a week-long vacation on Earth.

The devil particularly relished the idea of coming to Earth because of the abundant opportunities for chaos, destruction, and debauchery. This year, he came as a young businessman named Lucien, who lived in a penthouse in Manhattan. Everything was going according to the devil's plan until the morning of the seventh day. He was walking along the streets of New York City, enjoying the occasional whimpers of despair that emanated from the despairing citizens when he suddenly felt a sharp pain in his chest.

The devil fell on the ground, writhing in utter agony. In a moment, he was unable to move, speak, or even think. People crowded around him, wondering what was wrong. A kind elderly man had gotten hold of the devil's ID and wallet, which he used to call 911. He then passed out, and the last thing he ever saw was the devil's infamously malevolent eyes. 

The devil's body was too damaged for him to survive. The doctors spent hours trying to save him, to no avail. The devil died, one of the few times he had ever done so. However, the devil had made the mistake of choosing an organ donor for his temporary body.

The devil's eyes had a sinister glow, unlike anything the surgeons had ever seen. They were unlike any human eyes, in the sense that they were stricken with unspeakable evil. No one could dispute that they were both mesmerizing and chilling, all at the same time. It was utterly perplexing, and as the surgeon who got the devil's eyes, I couldn't grasp what had just happened.

When I got home, I spent hours staring at myself in the mirror, lost in thought. I tried to convince myself that it was nothing but a coincidence that I now had devil's eyes. However, I couldn't help but sense something uncanny about myself every time I looked at myself in the mirror. 

The devil's eyes changed me in strange ways. I began to see things differently, even though I couldn't understand why. However, quite unsettlingly, whenever I walked down the street at night, the people walking past would quickly keep their head down in fear and scurry away as fast as they could.

Soon, I began to notice several peculiarities, such as my reflection in a window while walking by oddly appearing more deadly, and any other reflecting surface seemed to put my eyes in a more macabre light. At night, I had terrible nightmares involving the devil's cold stare. I went to therapist after therapist, explaining the situation to them, but no one seemed to understand. Eventually, I resorted to heavy medication that barely helped me get any sleep.

I realized soon after my accident that people's first impression of me was now different, that my eyes always seemed to hold an air of maleficence, and the closer I got to someone, the more they tried to avoid me. It was as though I was carrying the embodiment of pure evil, and people could sense it. 

Sometimes I wonder whether the organ donation went wrong somewhere, or whether these indeed were the devil's eyes. Regardless, it's as though I inherited the malevolence that was the devil's essence, and I'm not sure I'll ever fully come to terms with it.
