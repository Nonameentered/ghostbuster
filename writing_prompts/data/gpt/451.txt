In a world where magic can be cast through song, musicians rule over society. You are the last of your kind, a Scandinavian Death Metal Singer.
In a world where magic could be cast through song, musicians governed over society. Each genre of music had its own special power. Pop singers could heal physical wounds and emotional scars with their melodies, while classical musicians could manipulate elements such as water and fire at their will.

But there was one genre that exuded raw power – death metal. Scandinavian death metal singers could summon the spirits of darkness, summon demons, and control the dead with their songs. They were a feared bunch, but also highly respected by others.

I was the last of my kind, a Scandinavian death metal singer. Once, there were many of us, but as time passed, our legacy faded away. Our music was too extreme, too brutal for the masses. It was only the hardcore fans who could appreciate our unique style of music.

I was performing in a dingy club in Helsingborg when I received the news that musicians had overtaken the government. I was not surprised. Musicians had always been the most powerful and well-respected people in society. But then the unthinkable happened. Only singers and musicians who ruled the nation, the rest of humanity subservient to them.

I was terrified. What would happen to my kind? We were already dying out – it was only a matter of time before we became extinct. I packed my bags and fled to the countryside, hoping to escape the wrath of the musician overlords.

I lived off the land, hiding from the eyes of the musicians. I had always felt like an outsider, even amongst my own kind, but now I truly was one. I reflected on the power of our music, how we were able to conjure up darkness with just our voice and instruments. Our music was pure, authentic – it wasn't just a performance, it was a way of life.

Then one day, I heard a rumour about the last death metal festival, held in the remote mountains of Norway. All the remaining death metal enthusiasts would be there – musicians, fans, and those, like me, fleeing from the authorities. I knew I had to go.

It was a treacherous journey, but I finally arrived at the foot of the mountains. The festival was only accessible via a hidden path, and there was a strict dress code. Black leather, chains, spikes – anything to embody the spirit of death metal.

As I walked towards the festival, I felt the ground shake with the force of the music. Flames erupted from the stage, and the air was thick with smoke, sweat, and adrenaline. I was both scared and exhilarated.

I saw musicians that I thought were long gone, my heart filling with joy. The kindred spirits who understood what it meant to be a death metal singer were all there. We huddled together, acknowledging the dire situation we were in, but also the beauty and power of our shared passion.

As the music filled the air, I realized that death metal would never die. Our music would always have a home, whether we were hiding in the mountains or performing on stage. The magic of music was too potent to be ignored, too deep in our hearts and souls. We would continue to sing and create, even if it meant living in the shadows.
