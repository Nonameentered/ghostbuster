At 22:58, Sarah had just gotten back from her evening walk. She checked the mailbox and found a small envelope with no return address but her name was written in perfectly neat handwriting. It was a note that said "23:00- you know where."

Sarah's curiosity was piqued but at the same time she was a little apprehensive. She tried to recall if she had made any plans with anyone for that time tonight but couldn't remember. She checked her phone and noticed no missed calls or messages.

With a minute left to go, she decided to follow the instructions on the note and set out to the abandoned lighthouse on the beach. As she got there, she saw a flickering light coming from the top of the tower. She climbed the spiral staircase slowly and cautiously.

At the top, she found her childhood best friend, Emily, who had moved away years ago and whom she had lost touch with. They hugged each other tight and spent the night reminiscing about their childhood. It was a beautiful reunion!
