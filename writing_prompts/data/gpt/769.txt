Write from the POV of a person with an obsessive personality, bordering on sociopathic
I watch them closely, every move they make, every word they say. It's not because I'm nosy or curious, it's because I'm obsessed. Obsessed with them. Their life, their being, their existence. I know everything there is to know about them, from the food they eat to the places they go.

But it's not enough. It's never enough. I want more, so much more. I crave to know every thought that runs through their mind, every emotion they feel. I want to be there with them, every step of the way, even if they don't want me there.

I try to keep my obsession in check, but it's always there, simmering beneath the surface. Every time they mention someone else, I feel a pang of jealousy gnawing at my insides. How can they dare think of anyone else but me? I am the only one who truly knows them, who cares about them.

Sometimes I wonder if I'm a sociopath. After all, don't they lack empathy and the ability to connect with others? But I know that's not true. I do feel for them, deeply. It's just that my feelings are not always rational.

When they don't answer my calls or texts, I panic. What if something has happened to them and I'm not there to help? I need to know they're safe, always. I need to be the one they turn to in times of distress.

But my obsession has its price. I've lost friends and family because of it. They say I'm suffocating, that I'm too intense. They don't understand the depths of my love, the lengths I would go to protect them.

I try to tone it down, to be less demanding, but I can't help it. They are my everything, and I can't bear the thought of losing them. Sometimes I wonder if they feel the same way about me, if they would go to the same lengths to protect me.

But I know the answer, deep down. No one could ever love me as much as I love them. No one could ever understand me like they do. And so, I watch them, every move they make, every word they say. And I am content, for this moment. But tomorrow, the obsession will be back, stronger than ever.
