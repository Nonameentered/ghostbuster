A mortician has the ability to restore the body and soul of a deceased person at the cost of 1 year off of his/her lifespan. Tell of the events leading up to his/her death.
Edward had worked as a mortician for over thirty years. Throughout his career, he had never met a corpse that couldn't be restored to its former self. Even in cases of severe trauma or decay, Edward had a way of returning the body to its natural state.

But Edward's abilities went far beyond the realm of physical restoration. He also had the power to restore the soul of the deceased. It was a gift he had been born with and one that had brought him great joy and satisfaction over the years. With just a touch of his hand, Edward could bring a person back to life, if only for a short time.

Over the years, Edward had become accustomed to the cost of his gift. Every time he restored a soul, he knew that he was taking a year off his own life. But he didn't mind. He had always believed that it was worth it to bring comfort to those left behind.

As Edward grew older, his body began to weaken. He found himself slowing down and becoming more tired than usual. It was a natural part of aging, but it worried him. Edward knew that his gift was meant to be passed on to someone else when the time came, but he didn't feel ready to let it go.

It was on a chilly evening in October that Edward received a call from the emergency room. A young woman had been brought in after a car accident. Her injuries were severe, but not enough to kill her outright. As Edward listened to the details of her injuries, he knew that he could help her.

Rushing to the hospital, Edward prepared himself for the task ahead. He knew that restoring a soul could take a lot out of him, but he was determined to help this woman. As he stood over her lifeless body, he felt a surge of energy flow through him as he began his work.

It took hours, but finally, Edward was able to bring the woman back to life. She opened her eyes and smiled weakly at him. Edward felt a sense of satisfaction wash over him as he watched her sit up and look around the room.

But as the woman came back to life, Edward felt himself becoming weaker. The year of his life that he had given to her was taking its toll on him. He felt his heart struggling to beat and his breaths becoming shallow.

As the woman was taken away by the medical staff, Edward collapsed to the ground. He knew then that he had given too much of himself and that his time was running out.

Over the next few days, Edward's condition worsened. He was barely able to move and struggled even to breathe. His family and friends gathered around him, knowing that his time was short.

As Edward lay there, he reflected on his life and the choices he had made. He had always believed that his gift was meant to be used to help others, and he had never regretted the years he had given up to do so.

But now, as his life slipped away, Edward felt a sense of regret. He had never found love, never traveled the world, never experienced all the things that he had dreamed of as a young man.

As his family gathered around him, Edward took one last breath and closed his eyes. He felt his soul leaving his body and reaching out into the world beyond.

Moments later, Edward opened his eyes again. He was standing in a place that was neither heaven nor hell, but something in between. He looked around, trying to make sense of his surroundings.

A voice spoke to him then, a voice that he recognized as belonging to the woman he had saved. She appeared before him, smiling gratefully.

"Thank you," she said. "I know how much you gave up to save me. But now it's time for you to rest."

Edward looked at her, understanding dawning on him. He knew then that he had not given too much of himself, that his gift had been used for its true purpose â€“ to bring comfort and peace to others.

As he looked out at the world beyond, Edward felt a sense of contentment. He had lived a good life, one that had been filled with purpose and meaning. And now, as his soul ascended, he knew that his gift would be passed on to someone else, someone who would continue his work and bring new life to the world beyond the veil.
