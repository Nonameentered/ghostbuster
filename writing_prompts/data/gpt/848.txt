Nobody knew his humanity wasn't entirely gone. The Lich had only ever loved one thing, his pet raven.
The Lich was feared by all who knew him. With his empty eye sockets and decaying flesh, he was a monster in every sense of the word. Rumors circulated about how he had gained his powers, but no one dared to ask him. And the few who did, never made it out of his castle alive.

Despite his fearsome reputation, the Lich had one soft spot in his heart. His pet raven, a sleek black bird he had found as a fledgling years ago, was the only creature he truly loved. The raven – who the Lich had taken to calling Midnight – was his constant companion, following him wherever he went and perching on his shoulder while he conducted his dark experiments.

To the townspeople, the Lich was a bogeyman, a creature to be avoided at all costs. But to Midnight, he was a master, a provider, and a companion. Midnight knew that the Lich was feared and hated, but he also knew that his humanity wasn't entirely gone.

It was a chilly autumn evening when the Lich felt something stir within him. For years, he had been consumed by his quest for power and had abandoned his humanity in the process. But tonight, something changed. As he sat in his study, surrounded by forbidden tomes and cursed artifacts, he looked around at the darkness and felt a stirring of emotion he had long thought dead.

It was then that Midnight fluttered onto his shoulder, cawing softly as he nuzzled against his owner's decaying cheek. The Lich felt a pang of affection for the bird and found himself stroking its sleek feathers without thinking.

In that moment, the Lich knew that his humanity wasn't entirely gone. There was still a part of him that could feel love and kindness. He knew that he could never show it to anyone else, but he vowed to himself that he would protect Midnight at all costs.

Days passed, and the Lich became more and more attached to his pet raven. He would spend hours talking to Midnight, telling him stories of the outside world and the adventures he had before he became the monster he was today. Midnight would listen attentively, cawing softly when the Lich paused for breath.

Despite his love for the raven, the Lich knew that he could never let anyone else know. If his enemies ever found out that he had a weakness, they would use it against him. And so, he continued to carry out his dark experiments, delving deeper into the secrets of life and death.

But even as he worked, the Lich could feel his love for Midnight growing stronger. He would find himself watching the bird as it hopped and fluttered around his study, marveling at its grace and beauty. And sometimes, when he was alone, he would find himself weeping silently at the thought of losing his only companion.

One day, the Lich received a visitor. A traveler had stumbled upon his castle, and despite all the warnings, had ventured inside. The Lich was furious at this intrusion and was about to unleash his wrath upon the hapless intruder when he saw something in the man's eyes.

It was fear, yes, but it was also something else. Something the Lich hadn't seen in a long time: hope.

The traveler, it turned out, was a healer. He had come to offer his services to the Lich, hoping to help him find a cure for whatever had turned him into a monster. At first, the Lich was skeptical. He had long believed that there was no cure for what he had become.

But the healer was insistent. He showed the Lich books he had brought with him, detailed accounts of powerful spells and ancient rituals that promised to restore him to his former self. The Lich was intrigued, and despite his reservations, agreed to let the healer try.

Weeks passed, and the Lich worked with the healer, desperate to find some way to reclaim his humanity. Midnight watched on curiously, sometimes perching on the books as the healer read through them. The Lich found that he had grown accustomed to the bird's constant presence, and he began to see it more and more as a symbol of hope.

Then, one day, the healer succeeded. Using a rare herb and incantations that had been passed down through generations, he managed to break the curse that had turned the Lich into a monster. As the power flowed through him, the Lich felt things he had thought long dead stirring within him: compassion, kindness, and love.

It was then that he looked at Midnight and realized that he had never truly loved the bird until now. The Lich was overcome with emotion, realizing that his affection for Midnight had been the only thing that had kept his humanity alive all these years. Determined to make things right, he vowed to show the raven the love and respect it deserved.

Years went by, and the Lich became a changed creature. He no longer used his powers for evil, instead devoting his life to healing the sick and helping those in need. And through it all, Midnight remained by his side, a constant companion and source of joy.

To the townspeople, the Lich was still a monster. But to Midnight, he was a master who had finally come back to himself. The raven knew that the Lich's humanity had never truly been gone; it had just been buried deep beneath the darkness. And as the two of them sat in the castle, watching the sunset over the mountains, the Lich felt a sense of peace he had not known for many years.

Nobody knew his humanity wasn't entirely gone. But to Midnight, it had always been there. And with the raven by his side, the Lich was finally able to find himself again.
