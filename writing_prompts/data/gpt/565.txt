Everyone gets a clock at birth with the countdown untill their deaths, one man's clock only says ERROR
John was born just like any other baby. But when he was handed his clock, it appeared blank. His parents, shocked, immediately took him to the doctor. They ran several tests but found nothing wrong with him. The clock, however, remained blank. The doctors had never seen anything like it before, and they concluded that it must be some sort of rare genetic defect.

As John grew up, he became increasingly aware of the oddity of his situation. Everywhere he went, he would see people checking their clocks, anxiously measuring out the time they had left. It was a grim reminder of the inevitability of death, and John couldn’t help but feel left out.

He was never sure when he would pass and what remained of his life, causing him to do things on a whim. He wanted to be spontaneous and enjoy every moment of his life to the fullest. As he grew older, John refused to let the lack of a countdown on his clock hold him back. He was determined to live in a way that would make life fulfill him completely.

He spent hours reading books, and he would often travel to foreign countries. He would try new experiences as often as he could, knowing that life was too short to waste time. John quickly became known to everyone as one of the happiest people around. His energy and ambition were contagious, and he made everyone around him feel that anything was possible.

But time continued to pass, and John began to worry about the future. He worried about how much time he had left and whether he was living his life to the fullest. It wasn't until he met a wise old man who told him that life wasn’t about the number of days you had on your clock. It was about the quality of the time you spent on Earth.

John realized that he had been so focused on the ticking hands of a clock that he had forgotten the real essence of his existence. Life wasn't about rushing things or reaching the next milestone; it was about living in the moment and making the most of what you had.

With these words, John's life changed once again. He no longer cared about the countdown, and he let go of the pressures of living a perfect life. He now focused on one goal, which was to live each and every day, whether it was his last or not, in a way that would make him happy.

The words of the wise old man stuck with John, and he realized that it's not the quantity but the quality of time that matters. He might not have a countdown on his clock, but he was grateful for every moment that he got to spend on this earth. John lived happily ever after, knowing that life was truly a gift, and that every moment was worth cherishing.
