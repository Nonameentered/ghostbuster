I was halfway through my flight, cruising above the world, when my eyes began to grow tired from staring at the in-flight movie screen. As always, the movie selection was limited, and the past few hours had been filled with dull and uninteresting films.

I decided to turn to my phone to pass the time. My airline, like many others, had Wi-Fi available for purchase during the flight. I purchased my access code, hoping to while away the hours scrolling through social media or reading interesting articles about anything and everything.

But as I connected to the outside world, the first article that caught my eye left me utterly chilled. "Breaking News: Another Flight Disappears."

As I read through the article, I couldn't believe what I was reading. Another airplane had vanished without a trace. It was the same model as the one I was currently flying on, and it had disappeared within the same hour that we had taken off.

Every detail of the article made my heart race. It was like reading a tragic story that was unfolding in real-time. The plane had just dropped off the radar, gone without a trace. And there was no indication of what might have happened to it.

I felt my palms begin to sweat, my breath quickening, as I looked around the plane. Were the other passengers reading the same article? Were they panicking as much as I was?

I tried to steady my nerves, telling myself that I was safe, that I had no reason to panic. But my mind was racing. I wanted out of my seat, to speak with the flight attendants or to check in with loved ones. But, I was too afraid to move.

After a few minutes of panic and stress, I began taking deep breaths to calm myself down. I reminded myself that panicking would only make things worse. Our plane might not have broken down, and there might have been a logical explanation.

I focused on trying to think rationally and not let anxiety take over my thoughts. I began to look around my immediate area and started to observe my fellow passengers.

Some appeared to sleep as if they didn't have a care in the world. Others were busy with their own activities, such as reading books, or watching a movie or an in-flight show. And then there were a few who, like me, had their smartphones out, scrolling through the Internet for any information they could get.

I tried to clear my mind of the anxiety that was still lingering within me and tried to distract myself. I started watching a documentary on the airline screen, but I couldn’t help but remain uneasy. The thoughts of what could have happened to us continued to invade my mind.

I couldn't help but catch myself staring at the flight attendant’s station, searching for any signs of concern or unusual activity amongst the crew. They seemed to be carrying out their duties as per usual, but that only raised more questions.

As the sun began to set outside, and we were in our flight path, I realized that we had been fortunate enough to travel a significant distance without experiencing any turbulence – one of the features of our aircraft model that had also been the concern of safety investigators.

As each minute dragged on, my heart was pounding in my chest, and I couldn't shake the thought of what could happen next. For a moment, I wished that I hadn't read the news and just spent the rest of the flight being bored and uninterested.

But, as we gradually began our descent into our destination, my heart skipped a beat, as I watched the view of the city down below. I felt euphoric, overjoyed that I made it in one piece.

I stepped off the plane, closing my eyes momentarily, relishing the ground beneath me. At that moment, my phone’s notification created a beep. I opened the message, and my heart sank again – it was a news update. "Missing Plane Found."

I clicked on the article, and tears welled up in my eyes. Another tragedy had occurred, another plane gone without a trace. I felt the weight of the day’s events hit me, and I wondered how I would ever feel safe enough to fly again.
