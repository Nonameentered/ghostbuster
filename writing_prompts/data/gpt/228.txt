The world was in absolute shock when God announced he would be holding a press event the following Wednesday. People from around the world waited with bated breath to find out what the Almighty had to say. But nobody could have guessed what was about to happen.

It was a sunny day, with not a cloud in sight as the press gathered at the event, some with cameras and microphones in hand. The atmosphere was tense; everyone was eager to know what God had to say. The press had always been curious about the Creator, and this was their chance to hear from him directly.

When God finally appeared, all eyes were on him. He looked like a normal man, dressed in a white robe and sandals, with long hair and a beard. He smiled politely at the press, but there was something in his eyes that suggested he was about to deliver some shocking news.

"My dear children," God began. "I'm sorry to say that I've gathered you here today to make a confession." He paused, took a deep breath, and continued.

"I've always hated humans. Yes, that's correct; I've hated every single one of you since the very beginning of time."

The press was stunned. No one knew what to say or do. God had just admitted he hated them; it was unimaginable.

"I know this is hard to hear," God continued. "But you see, humans have always been so self-centered and self-righteous. You've always taken everything I've given you for granted and never showed any gratitude. I gave you life, love, and beauty, and yet all you do is fight with one another. You're always so quick to judge, so quick to condemn, and so quick to hate. I'm just tired of it."

The press was speechless; they couldn't believe what they were hearing. Here was the Creator of the universe, the all-knowing, all-powerful God who had always been revered by countless millions, admitting he hated humans.

"Please don't misunderstand me, my children," God said. "I'm not here to punish you or harm you in any way. I still love you; I always will. But I just needed to get this off my chest. You see, I've been feeling this way for a very long time, and I can't keep pretending anymore. I need to be honest with you."

The press was still too shocked to say anything, but some brave reporters managed to ask a few questions.

"Why did you create us if you hate us so much?" one reporter asked.

"I created humans because I thought you could make the world a better place," God answered. "I had high hopes for you, but it seems like I was wrong. You've done some good things, of course, but you've done a lot more harm. And that makes me sad. I'm not angry, but I am disappointed."

Another reporter asked, "What do you want us to do? How can we make things right?"

God sighed. "I'm not sure, to be honest. I think it's something you'll need to figure out on your own. But I would suggest starting with being kinder to one another. Show love and compassion, rather than hate and judgment. Try to be humble, and remember that you're not the center of the universe. There are other living creatures on this earth that need your care and attention too."

For a few moments, the press was silent, digesting God's words. It was hard to know what to think or feel. This was such a dramatic departure from everything they had ever been taught.

Suddenly, a reporter spoke out. "What will happen to us now? Will you punish us for our sins?"

God smiled then. "I'm not going to punish you, my child. I'm not that kind of God. But you need to understand that every action has a consequence. If you choose to continue on your current path, there will be consequences. But it's not up to me to decide those consequences."

And with that, God disappeared, leaving the press in a state of confusion and disbelief. 

In the days that followed, the world was different. People were kinder to one another, more supportive and caring. The press were hesitant to report on anything at all; it was as if everyone was waiting for something to change.

But things did not change as much as the people hoped it would. Despite God’s confession, the world remained as it was before. And although people did start to pay more attention to their deeds, it wasn't enough to erase the shame of their history with their Creator.

For many, God's confession was a wakeup call. It was a reminder to be better, to be more loving and kinder towards each other. It was a time of self-reflection, an opportunity to re-evaluate their actions and try to make amends.

However, for some, God's confession was the last straw. They couldn't believe that the Creator of the universe hated them. And so, they turned away from him, from religion, and from the notion of faith entirely.

It wasn't long before conversations of God’s confession became history. The world went back to the way it was before, and the people of the world continued with their lives, some trying to make the world a better place while others kept perpetuating their negative actions.

God’s confession became the headline in every newspaper, made its way to the evening news and was shared on every social media platform. But eventually, it faded away into oblivion just like every trending news item. 

The world kept spinning as it always did, unaware of the confession of the Creator, and the event that shook the world came to be just another footnote in the story of humanity. It was not the end of the world as many feared, and the world did not change as much as some hoped it would. 

It was just God’s confession after all, and the world kept going on, just like it always does.
