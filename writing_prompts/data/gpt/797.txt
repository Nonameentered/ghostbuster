The night was dark and silent, the only sound coming from the occasional distant bark of a dog. But the silence was soon broken by the sound of heavy footsteps, each one accompanied by a jingle of bells. It was Santa Claus, but he was not carrying a sack full of toys.

Instead, he was holding a thick book in his gloved hands. The book was the infamous Naughty List, but it wasn't filled with the names of naughty children. It was filled with the names of the most notorious criminals on the planet.

For years, Santa Claus had been silently watching over the world, keeping an eye on those who had committed evil deeds. He'd seen the worst of humanity, and he decided that it was time to take matters into his own hands.

He started to bring justice to those who deserved it. Instead of coal, he gave them a taste of their own medicine.

Tonight, Santa was on his way to deliver his justice to one of the most dangerous criminals on his list, a man named Thomas Parker. Parker was a renowned drug lord with a long history of violence, and it was time for him to pay for his crimes.

As he neared Parker's hideout, Santa stopped in his tracks. The place was heavily guarded, and it was clear that he would have to be careful if he wanted to succeed.

Taking a deep breath, Santa made his way towards the guards, each step calculated and silent. He had no intention of taking lives unnecessarily, but he wasn't about to let anyone stand in his way.

With a swift strike, Santa knocked out the two guards nearest to him. He moved quickly, making his way to Parker's room.

Parker was asleep when Santa arrived, but the noise of his entrance caused the criminal to stir. Without a word, Santa pulled out a pair of handcuffs and restrained the drug lord.

"You've been very naughty, Mr. Parker," Santa said, his voice low and menacing. "You have brought misery to countless people, destroyed families, and corrupted children. It's time for you to pay for your sins."

Parker tried to protest, but Santa ignored him. He swiftly loaded Parker onto his back and made his way outside, leaving the guards behind. He still had work to do.

As he started towards the edge of town, Santa was stopped by a figure in the shadows. It was a woman, dressed in rags and looking malnourished.

"Please, sir, I need your help," the woman said, her voice shaking.

Santa's heart went out to her, and he stopped to listen.

"I have a daughter," she said. "She's sick, and I can't afford to buy her medicine. I know you're not here to help people like me, but please, can you spare anything?"

Santa thought for a moment before reaching into his pocket and pulling out a small pouch.

"Take this," he said, handing her the pouch. "It's all I can give you, but it should help your daughter."

The woman looked up, tears in her eyes, and whispered her thanks.

Santa continued his journey, but with a heavy heart. He knew that not everyone on his list was evil, that there were those who were simply struggling to survive.

But deep down, he believed that by bringing down the worst of the worst, he was creating a better world for everyone. And so, he continued on his mission, delivering his own brand of justice to those who deserved it.

As dawn broke, he made his way back to his home in the North Pole, ready to start a new day. He knew that there would always be evil in the world, but he also knew that he would be there, watching from the shadows, bringing justice to those who deserved it most.
