Aliens contact humanity and express their desire to trade. A convention is organized to show the aliens what earth has to offer. No one expects what the aliens are most interested in buying.
When the aliens first made contact with humanity, everyone was understandably shocked. The idea that we were not alone in the universe was something that had fascinated people for centuries, but few truly believed that we would ever have proof of it. And yet, here they were: strange, otherworldly beings who spoke in a language that none of us had ever heard before.

At first, there was a lot of fear and uncertainty. People worried that the aliens might be hostile, or that they might have come to take over our planet. But as it turned out, they were actually interested in trading with us.

A convention was organized to showcase everything that Earth had to offer. There were displays of technology, art, and culture from all around the world. Some of the more ambitious entrepreneurs even brought samples of various rare minerals and metals that they hoped would be of interest to the aliens.

But nobody expected what the aliens were most interested in buying. It turned out that what they really wanted was something that we all take for granted: music. They were fascinated by our musical instruments and the way that we used them to express ourselves.

And so, the convention became a kind of intergalactic jam session. Musicians from all over the world played for the aliens, who listened with rapt attention. In the end, the aliens left with a cargo hold full of various instruments, both ancient and modern. They promised to return with more trade opportunities in the future, but somehow, everyone knew that it would be music that remained their greatest interest.
