As a child, Mary always thought her imaginary friends were real. As she grew older, those friends turned into darker visions that lingered even after she had woken up. It was as though her dreams had a life of their own, seeping into her reality and causing her to question the validity of everything she saw.

Today was different, though. Today, the hallucination felt too real. She had seen something so horrific, it was almost impossible to believe it wasn't just another one of her delusions.

She had been walking home from work when she saw a group of men attacking a woman. Her heart pounding, Mary ran over to try and help. But as she got closer, she noticed something strange. The men's faces were distorted, twisted in ways that didn't seem humanly possible. And the woman they were attackingâ€¦ it was almost as if she wasn't really there.

Mary stumbled back in terror, unsure of what to do. She tried to tell herself that it was just another hallucination, but she couldn't shake the feeling that what she saw had actually happened. Was she going crazy? Had her hallucinations finally taken over completely?

As she made her way home, Mary couldn't stop thinking about what she had seen. She had always been able to tell that her hallucinations weren't real, but now she wasn't so sure. Her mind kept replaying the scene like a loop, each time leaving her more and more confused.

It wasn't until the next day, when she saw a news report about a woman who had been attacked in the same spot, that Mary realized it was all too real. She wasn't crazy after all. But the relief was short-lived, as she knew that her hallucinations would continue to haunt her. They always did.
