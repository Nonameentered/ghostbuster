Life is indeed a simulation. At least, that’s what they told me. When you die, you get re-inserted in a new life. It’s all part of the game, you know? A game that nobody knew they were playing until it was too late. Nobody except me, that is.

I had always known something was off about the world we lived in. I could never quite put my finger on it, but I always had a feeling that things weren’t quite as they seemed. It was only after I died that I finally figured it out.

It was like waking up from a dream. Suddenly, everything made sense. The world I had known was just an illusion, a carefully crafted simulation designed to keep us all in line. With my newfound knowledge, I was ready to face whatever came next. Or so I thought.

As it turns out, I had pissed off the supervisor in charge of re-inserting me into the simulation. I should have seen it coming, really. I had always been a bit of a troublemaker, even in my past life. But I never could have imagined what he had in store for me.

The first thing I noticed was the pain. It was like nothing I had ever felt before. My body was on fire, every nerve ending screaming out in agony. I tried to scream, but no sound came out. I was too busy convulsing, my muscles seizing up uncontrollably.

I don’t know how long it lasted. It felt like an eternity, but it could have been mere seconds. When it finally stopped, I was left gasping for air, my body slick with sweat. The supervisor was standing over me, a smug grin on his face.

“Welcome back,” he said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. “Didn’t you miss me?”

I tried to speak, but my throat was raw. All I could manage was a raspy whisper.

“What…what was that?”

He laughed. “Oh, just a little something I cooked up. A little taste of what’s to come if you don’t start behaving.”

I glared at him, trying to ignore the pain still coursing through me. “Behaving? What the hell are you talking about?”

He shrugged. “You know, following the rules. Playing the game like you’re supposed to. You’re not special, you know. You’re just another player like everyone else.”

I scoffed. “If this is a game, I’m not playing by your rules.”

He chuckled. “Oh, I’m afraid you don’t have a choice. You’re stuck here, whether you like it or not. And you’re going to keep getting re-inserted until you learn to follow the rules.”

I gritted my teeth, feeling a surge of anger boil within me. “I’m not a pawn in your little game. I won’t be controlled.”

He smirked. “Oh, I think you’ll find that you will. You see, I have all the power here. I can make your life a living hell, or I can make it a paradise. It’s all up to me.”

For a moment, I felt a flicker of doubt. Was he really that powerful? Was I truly powerless in this simulation?

But then, I remembered the pain. The searing agony that had ripped through me just moments before. If this was what he considered paradise, then I wanted no part of it.

I took a deep breath, trying to calm my racing heart. “Fine. If I’m going to be here, then I’m going to do it on my own terms. I won’t be a pawn in your game. I’ll make my own rules.”

The supervisor just laughed. “Oh, you’re a brave one, aren’t you? But mark my words, you will learn your place. You will learn to follow the rules.”

With that, he turned and walked away, leaving me alone in the simulated world.

I looked around, taking in my surroundings. It was a stereotypical suburban neighborhood, complete with white picket fences and neatly trimmed lawns. But something about it felt off, like it was all too perfect.

I started to walk, exploring the familiar streets. It felt like I had been here before, even though I knew it was all just a construct. As I walked, I started to notice the little details. The cracks in the pavement, the faded paint on the houses, the overgrown weeds in the gardens.

It was like the more I looked, the more the illusion started to break down. And with that breakdown came a sense of freedom. If this was all just a simulation, then what did any of it truly matter?

I smiled, feeling a sense of joy bubble up within me. If I was going to be stuck here, then I was going to make it my own. I was going to live on my own terms, consequences be damned.

Life is indeed a simulation. But that doesn’t mean we have to be controlled by those in charge. We can make our own destiny, even in the face of adversity. And that’s exactly what I intended to do.
