A person wakes up one day and realises that they're missing a body part.
Emma woke up with a start. Something was wrong, but she couldn't quite put her finger on it. She got out of bed and went to the bathroom, still feeling groggy. As she looked in the mirror, she screamed. Her right arm was missing.

Emma couldn't believe what she was seeing. She looked around the room, but her arm was nowhere in sight. Had someone stolen it? Had she lost it somehow? Emma felt a knot forming in her stomach. She was completely baffled.

She decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help her. The doctors examined her, but they couldn't find any evidence of an injury or amputation. Emma was even more confused now. What was happening to her?

Days passed and Emma started to adapt to her new reality. She had to learn to do everything with one arm, and it wasn't easy. She felt frustrated and angry all the time. She missed her arm more than anything. She couldn't sleep at night, constantly thinking about what had happened to her.

One evening, Emma decided to take a walk around her neighborhood. She felt restless and needed to clear her head. As she walked, she suddenly felt something move under her shirt. She lifted it to see what was going on, and there it was â€“ her missing arm, reattached to her body.

Emma let out a scream of joy. She was whole again. She sat down on the sidewalk and cried tears of relief and gratitude. She knew she would never take her body for granted again.
