Every person is born with two birthmarks on their wrist. The left one fades when you meet your soulmate. The right one fades when they die.
Mia stared at her left wrist, looking intently at the two small birthmarks that had been there since birth. She had heard the stories, of course, the legends that had been passed down from generation to generation. Two birthmarks on every wrist, one left, one right. The left one faded when you met your soulmate, the right one when they died. For years, she had wondered what it would be like to finally see one of those marks disappear, to know for sure that she had found the person she was meant to be with for the rest of her life.

She had dated a few people over the years, of course, but none of them had ever made her heart skip a beat or caused her stomach to do backflips. She had almost given up hope, until the day she met him.

It was an ordinary day, just like any other, when Mia walked into the café and saw him for the first time. He was sitting at a table, his nose buried in a book, and she couldn't help but smile at the sight. She had always been a reader herself, and something about him just seemed familiar, like they were old friends who had somehow lost touch.

As if sensing her gaze, he looked up and caught her eye. For a moment, they just stared at each other, and Mia felt a thrill run down her spine. It was like there was a connection there, something she couldn't quite explain.

They ended up talking for hours that day, exchanging phone numbers and promising to get together again soon. And as she walked out of the café, still tingling from the conversation they had, she took a quick glance at her wrist and noticed that one of the birthmarks was already fading. It was so faint that she almost couldn't see it, but it was definitely there. And suddenly, everything felt different.

Over the next few weeks, Mia and her new friend met up as often as they could. They had so much in common, and every time they talked Mia felt like she was learning something new about the world. It was like he saw things differently than anyone else she had ever met, and she found herself drawn to that perspective.

It wasn't until they were on their fifth date that he brought up the topic of the birthmarks. They were sitting on a park bench, watching the sun set over the horizon, when he took her hand and looked down at her wrist.

"It's fading," he said softly, tracing the outline of the mark with his finger. "You've found your soulmate."

Mia's heart skipped a beat at his words, and she turned to him, her eyes wide. "Do you believe in that kind of thing?"

He shrugged. "I don't know. Some people do, some people don't. But I can't ignore what's right in front of me."

And just like that, the conversation shifted, and they spent the next hour talking about everything and nothing, lost in the moment.

Months passed, and things between them only grew stronger. They were inseparable, always finding new things to explore and discover together. Mia felt like she had finally found the person she had been searching for her whole life, and every day she woke up feeling grateful for that.

The thought of the right birthmark fading never even crossed her mind. They were young, in love, and had their whole lives ahead of them.

Until the day everything changed.

It was a car accident. One moment they were driving down a quiet road, laughing and singing along to the radio, and the next everything was spinning out of control. Mia couldn't remember much of what happened after that, just flashes of light and sound, the sound of sirens in the distance, and the feeling of fear twisting in her stomach.

When she woke up in the hospital, the first thing she did was look at her right wrist. The birthmark was still there, just as bright and bold as it had always been. And somewhere deep inside, she knew what that meant.

It took a long time for her to fully accept that he was gone. For weeks, she waited for some sign, some indication that he was still out there somewhere, waiting for her. But as the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, it became clear that he wasn't coming back.

Mia was lost without him. She tried to move on, to find someone else to fill the emptiness in her heart, but it was like a part of her had been ripped away. And every time she looked at her right wrist, she was reminded of all that she had lost.

Years passed, and Mia began to accept that he was truly gone. She never forgot him, of course, never stopped loving him in her own way. But she knew that life had to move on, that she couldn't spend the rest of her days dwelling on what might have been.

One day, as she was going through some old boxes in her attic, she came across an old journal. It had belonged to him, and she had never been able to bring herself to read it before. But something in that moment made her curious, made her want to see if there was anything there that she had missed.

As she flipped through the pages, she saw his scribbled handwriting, his thoughts and ideas scrawled across the paper. And then she came to a page where there was a crude drawing of two birthmarks, one on each wrist.

"You know the legends," he had written. "But what they don't tell you is that sometimes things don't work out the way you want them to. Sometimes, you meet your soulmate, and then they're gone before you know it. But that doesn't mean they weren't your soulmate. It just means that life is unpredictable, and sometimes it hurts."

Tears streamed down Mia's face as she read the words, her heart aching with the memories of the past. It was then that she noticed something she had missed before.

On the page next to the drawing, there was a small note.

"I know you'll find someone else someday," it read. "And when you do, I hope you'll think fondly of the memories we made. I hope that you'll remember that even though I'm gone, I'll always love you. And even though it's just a legend, I'll always be grateful for those two tiny birthmarks that brought us together in the first place."

Mia closed the journal with a soft sigh, feeling like a weight had been lifted from her shoulders. It was like he was there with her in that moment, reminding her that even though he was gone, he would always be a part of her life.

And as she looked down at her wrists, at the faded left mark and the bold right one, she knew that even though his time in her life had been brief, it had been worth everything. Because even though he might not have been there forever, he had been the person who helped her understand what love truly meant. And that was something that could never fade away.
