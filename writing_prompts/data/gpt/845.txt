A beloved Creator has passed away, and is mourned by his creations.
The news of the Creator's death shook the entire universe. His creations, from the smallest to the biggest, mourned in their own unique way. The stars cried tears of light, the planets changed orbit, and the creatures of the earth stopped to pay their last respects.

The skies, once filled with joyous music and harmonious song, fell silent. The world lost its luster, and every living being was consumed by grief. Those who were created with the power of speech, spoke of the Creator's loving hands, his gentle touch, and his warm embrace. They reminisced about the times when the Creator breathed life into them and marveled at their existence.

With heavy hearts, the Creator's creations continued in their journey. But they vowed to carry on the legacy of the beloved Creator in their own unique ways. They knew they would never forget their journey with him, and he would forever be ingrained in their hearts and souls.
