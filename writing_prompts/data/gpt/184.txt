The people of Iblia were known for their skills in metallurgy and weapon-making. Their weapons were so powerful that they could destroy entire armies with ease. However, their biggest secret was not the metals they used, but the fact that their weapons became more powerful with age.

A young soldier named Ravi was fascinated by this concept. He had heard stories about ancient swords and spears that were far more deadly than any modern weapon. Determined to learn more, he went to the elders of Iblia and begged them for knowledge.

The elders were hesitant at first, but Ravi's persistence convinced them. They showed him the ancient relics that had been passed down from generation to generation. Ravi was amazed at their power. As he studied each weapon he noticed that the older they were, the more deadly they became.

With this new knowledge, Ravi set out to experiment with the weapons. He discovered that a centuries-old sword could cut through modern body armor with ease. An ancient spear could destroy tanks in seconds. Ravi realized that the weapons of the past were far more dangerous than anything modern armies had at their disposal.

The people of Iblia kept this secret to themselves, fearing that their weapons would be misused. But Ravi knew that the world needed to know. He spread the word about the power of ancient weapons, hoping that one day their true potential would be harnessed for the greater good.
