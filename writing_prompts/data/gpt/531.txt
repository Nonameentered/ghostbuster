You are the lone survivor of of some fatal event. You die immediately afterwards in the most pathetic and humiliating way possible.
I was the lone survivor of a plane crash that left me stranded on a deserted island. I had hoped to make my way back to civilization, but as days turned to weeks, I realized that I was alone. I rationed what little food and water I had, and did my best to stay alive.

One day, I was exploring the island when I heard a rustling in the bushes. I froze, unsure of what creature might be lurking there. But it was no animal that emerged. It was a band of pirates, dressed in tattered clothing and carrying swords and muskets.

I was terrified, but I tried to remain calm. The leader of the pirates spoke to me in broken English. "You come with us," he said. "You have something we want."

I didn't know what he was talking about, but I knew I didn't have a choice. I followed them as they brought me to their ship, a worn vessel that looked like it had seen better days.

As soon as I was onboard, the pirates began to loot the island. They took everything they could find, from weapons to trinkets to food. But they saved the most valuable prize for last: me.

They tied me up and brought me to the captain's quarters. I was scared out of my mind, but I tried to reason with them. "Please let me go," I begged. "I'm just a survivor. I have nothing of value."

But the pirates didn't listen. They laughed as they lit a fuse and set the ship on fire, watching as I burned alive. I screamed for help, but no one came. I died alone and afraid, the most pathetic and humiliating way anyone could die.
