While walking, you notice everyone recoiling from a young woman. you speak to her to find out why. through her surprise, she explains she is death and everyone else sees a person based on how they feel about the concept of death. You've never seen a more beautiful or inviting person.
I was walking down the busy streets of downtown when I noticed something strange happening ahead. People were walking past a young woman, but they were all recoiling in fear and disgust. I became curious, and as I got closer, I could see that the young woman was stunningly beautiful. I approached her and asked her why everyone was reacting to her that way.

She looked at me with wide eyes, as if confused by my question. "I'm Death," she said softly. I was taken aback for a moment, but then my curiosity peaked even more. 

"What do you mean?" I asked.

She gestured at the people walking by. "They see me based on how they feel about death. Some see me as a monster, others run away from me because they think I'm here for them."

I was surprised by what she was saying. I had never heard of anything like this before. But I couldn't see anything but breathtaking beauty when I looked at her. 

"Can I see you for who you really are?" I asked softly.

She hesitated for a moment, then nodded. 

The transformation was instant. The young woman, who was once dressed in a black tattered outfit and had dark circles around her eyes, transformed into someone entirely different. She transformed into the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. She was dressed in a long white gown that amplified her brilliant blue eyes, and her skin had a gorgeous glow that seemed to radiate from within.

I was in awe. I had never seen anyone so stunningly beautiful. It was as if she was an angel. It didn't make sense that people were afraid of her. 

"Why do people see you that way?" I questioned her.

She shrugged her shoulders. "I suppose the concept of death scares people. They all have different beliefs and opinions about it. Some believe it's a natural part of the cycle of life, while others think it's the end of the line. I can't change their minds, so I don't try to."

I nodded my head in understanding as we started to walk together. We walked in silence for a while until she finally broke it.

"No one has ever seen me the way you do. It's usually just the opposite."

"Why is that?" I asked softly.

She sighed, "I'm bound to follow where death leads. It's my duty, and it's not something most people want to be near. Especially when it comes as naturally as breathing for me."

"I suppose that makes sense," I replied, trying to wrap my head around the situation.

We continued to walk, and I couldn't help but be captivated by her stunning beauty. I felt tranquil and content in her presence, something I had never experienced before but was deeply grateful for.

As we parted ways, she smiled at me. For a moment, I couldn't bring myself to take my eyes off her. 

"Thank you," I whispered as I walked away from her.

I continued walking, and as I looked around, I noticed people were still recoiling from her the way they had before. But for me, she was Death, a concept I had always been scared of, but she wasn't scary. I couldn't wait to see her again, to be comforted by her existence and bask in her beauty once more. 

That encounter with Death changed my life forever, and I knew that I would never be afraid of the unknown again. Instead, I would rely on the beauty and kindness of those around me, even if they happened to be Death itself.
