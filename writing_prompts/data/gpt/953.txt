You die and your soul goes to Hell. Your soul awakens to a rather annoyed Soul Tech who is stumped why you are there. Hell, you discover, isn't a place of eternal torment but rather one that repairs broken souls before reincarnation.
I closed my eyes for the last time, feeling the cold embrace of death slowly creeping up on me. I had always been a skeptic about the afterlife. But here I was, suspended in the void, waiting for my inevitable fate. Suddenly, my surroundings changed. I felt as though I was being pulled into a dark, twisted dimension. Soon, I was standing in front of a rather annoyed-looking Soul Tech.

I was confused. Wasn't I supposed to be in Hell, the place of eternal torment? But as I looked around, my assumptions were shattered. The place I had been transported to was strange. It wasn't the fiery pit of Hell I had imagined. Instead, it looked like a workshop full of strange devices.

The Soul Tech stared at me, as if to assess what was wrong with my soul. "What brings you here?" she asked, her tone sharp.

"I... I don't know," I stammered.

"It's strange. You don't seem like you belong here," she said, confused.

"Wait. What do you mean?" I asked, trying to understand the situation.

"Most souls that come here to repair themselves are in tatters. Their entire existence is shattered beyond repair. But your soul seems... different. It's not broken, but it's not complete either. It's like you're somewhere in between," she replied, agitated.

I was taken aback. What did she mean by my soul not being complete? I had always thought I was doing okay.

"You see, Hell isn't what most people think it is. It's not a place of eternal torment. Instead, it's a place where broken souls come to repair themselves before they are reincarnated," the Soul Tech explained.

"I always thought Hell was a place for punishment," I said, still trying to wrap my head around the situation.

"The concept of eternal damnation is just a human interpretation. Each soul that comes here has a unique path to follow, and the job of a Soul Tech is to guide them through that path. It's a place of healing, not punishment."

"How long do I have to stay here then?" I asked, feeling a little bit relieved.

"It's difficult to say. No two souls are alike, and the time it takes to repair them varies. Some take centuries, while others can be fixed in a matter of weeks. It all depends on the work that needs to be done," she said.

"What's wrong with my soul?" I asked, now worried about the state of my existence.

"It's not for me to say. You have to go through the process of healing before you can understand the nature of your soul. But rest assured, we will do everything in our power to make sure you find your way back to the world with a renewed sense of purpose," the Soul Tech said, as she walked away, leaving me alone with my thoughts.

I felt a sense of peace wash over me as I realized that my journey wasn't over yet. There was still a chance for me to find meaning in life and make things right. I gazed around the room, taking in the strange instruments and devices that adorned the walls. They looked like they belonged in a sci-fi movie, but they were real, and I was going to be a part of the process.

Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. I lost track of time as I went through the process of healing my soul. It was the most intense experience of my entire existence. Every day, I was pushed to my limits, made to confront my deepest fears and darkest thoughts. But I persevered, knowing that I was on a journey of self-discovery.

As time passed, I felt myself changing. My soul was beginning to shed the layers of negativity that had once engulfed it. It felt lighter, more radiant than ever before. I began to understand why Hell existed and what it meant to be reborn into the world with a purpose.

Finally, the day arrived when I was declared healed. My soul was now complete, and I was ready to embark on a new journey. The Soul Tech stood in front of me, a smile on her face.

"It's time for you to go," she said, as she handed me a small black book.

"What's this?" I asked, surprised.

"It's your life's story. Every soul that comes here writes their own book. It's your guide to who you are and what your purpose is," she said, as she ushered me towards a glowing portal.

I took one final look around the workshop, realizing that Hell wasn't what I thought it was. It was a place where souls came to repair themselves, to find meaning in their lives. And as I stepped through the portal, I felt a sense of excitement wash over me.

I was going back to the world, but this time I had a purpose. My journey wasn't over yet, but I knew I was about to embark on a path that would change everything. And as I walked away, I knew I would never forget the lessons I had learned in Hell.
