For as long as I could remember, everyone spoke in a different font. My mother, who was a school teacher, spoke in a classic Times New Roman. My best friend, who was a comedian, spoke in a whimsical Comic Sans. And my boss, who was the CEO of a major company, spoke in a bold and authoritative Helvetica.

I thought I had seen it all, every font imaginable, until one day, while walking to work, I heard someone speaking in a font I had never heard before. It was delicate and intricate, with swirls and curls that made the letters dance across the air. I was mesmerized.

I looked around, trying to find the source of the voice, and finally, I spotted her. She was walking a few paces ahead of me, her hair tied in a loose bun, and a small notebook in her hand. She was talking to someone on the phone, her voice low and melodic, and every word she spoke seemed to spark and glitter around her.

I couldn't help myself; I quickened my pace, trying to catch up to her. When I finally did, I tapped her on the shoulder. She turned around, and I was struck by her beauty. Her eyes were a deep blue, and her skin was the color of honey. She smiled at me, and I swear, the entire world lit up.

"Hi," I said, feeling suddenly shy and awkward.

"Hello," she replied, her voice still ringing in that unfamiliar font. "Can I help you with something?"

"I'm sorry, this is going to sound really weird," I began, "but I couldn't help but hear you speaking on the phone, and your font... it's unlike anything I've ever heard before. What is it?"

She laughed, a light and tinkling sound, and I felt my heart stutter.

"That's a strange question. But I suppose you could say I'm speaking in Garamond," she said, twirling a strand of hair around her finger.

"Garamond?"

"Yes, it's an old font, but I like it. It's elegant and refined, don't you think?" She smiled again, and I felt my knees go weak.

I didn't know how to respond, so I just stood there, gaping at her like a fool. She was so beautiful, so graceful, and her font only added to the elegance she exuded.

She must have noticed my staring, because she chuckled and shook her head.

"Well, it was nice meeting you," she said, starting to walk away.

"Wait, can I at least know your name?" I blurted out.

"Of course. It's Ariana. And yours?"

"Robert," I said, feeling stupidly tongue-tied.

"A pleasure, Robert." She gave me a wave, and then she was gone.

I stood there, watching her walk away, feeling dazed and dizzy. I had never been so taken with someone before. Her font, her voice, her smile... it was all too much to take in.

For the rest of the day, I couldn't shake Ariana out of my mind. Every time I heard someone speaking in Garamond, my heart would leap, and I found myself searching for her in every crowd. I knew it was ridiculous, but I couldn't help myself. There was something about her, something enchanting and magnetic, that drew me to her like a moth to a flame.

Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months, but I never saw Ariana again. I even asked around, trying to find out who she was and where she worked, but nobody seemed to know. It was as if she had disappeared into thin air.

I tried to forget about her, tried to move on with my life, but every time I heard someone speaking in Garamond, my heart would ache with longing. It was like a constant reminder of the beauty and mystery that had swept into my life and left just as suddenly.

Years went by, and I grew older and wiser, but I never forgot about Ariana. She remained a mystery to me, a beautiful enigma that had captured my heart with nothing more than her font. And to this day, I still listen for the whisper of Garamond, hoping that someday, somehow, I'll be lucky enough to hear her voice again.
