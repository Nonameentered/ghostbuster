Upon his suicide Hitler will join the dead waiting to be ferried across the river Styx. The dead include the millions who died in WWII. You have been tasked with keeping Hitler safe until he can arrive for his final judgment.
It was a daunting task, one that I never thought I would be given. My job was to protect Adolf Hitler as he waited to be ferried across the river Styx to begin his final judgment. The thought of being in the same room as the man responsible for so much death and destruction made my skin crawl, but I was determined to do my job.

As I stood outside the door to his room, I couldn't help but think about the millions of people who died at his hands. The thought of him joining them in death made me shudder. I took a deep breath and pushed the door open.

Hitler sat at the end of the bed, staring off into space. He was a shell of the man he once was, a broken remnant of his former self. He didn't even acknowledge my presence in the room.

Days dragged on as I stood guard, waiting for the inevitable. I tried to keep myself busy, pacing the room, flipping through old magazines, and spending hours staring out the window, looking for any signs of the ferry that would take us across the river of the dead.

Then, one day, it happened. I could sense it in the air; it was time. I stood at attention, waiting for the ferryman to arrive. The room began to fill with spirits, the dead from WWII appeared before us. They lingered, whispering among themselves, awaiting the arrival of their leader.

When the boat finally appeared on the distant shore, I braced myself for what was to come. In silence, I led Hitler out to the boat. We stepped on board and sat in silence, watching as the boat made its way across the choppy waters.

As we finally approached the shore on the other side, I could see three figures waiting for us. One of them was Hitler's final judge.

I stayed with him until the end, watching as he was judged for his actions on Earth. He was banished to a place of eternal torment, and I returned to the realm of the living, feeling both relieved and saddened by what I had witnessed.

The memory of my time with Hitler stayed with me for years, a grueling reminder of the horrors of war and the sacrifices that we must make in the pursuit of peace.
