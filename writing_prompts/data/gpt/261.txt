Everyone has a number on their chest showing how many people they will kill in the next month. Yours just changed from 1 to 3 million.
As soon as I opened my eyes in the morning, I looked down at my chest. The number printed on it had always been 1, an unchanging digit that had haunted me for years. I knew that I would have to take a life in the upcoming month, but I had no idea who, why, or how. That was the most dreadful thing about the number; it left everything up to fate, chance, and circumstance. But today, something strange had happened. Instead of the solitary digit, I saw three zeroes next to it. My chest now displayed the number 3 million. I gasped and clutched at my chest, wondering how this could have happened. Who had determined this? How would I ever be able to carry out such a monstrous feat? Millions of fear, confusion, and darkness enveloped me, as if I was already responsible for a mass genocide. The next month, I spent every moment obsessing over the number. I barely left my home, stopped going to work, and isolated myself from my loved ones. But as the days went by, nothing happened. No orders were given, no signs were shown, no voices were heard. And then, as abruptly as it had appeared, the number vanished. My chest was blank once again. Precisely one year later, I learned that a comet had passed by Earth, emitting an electromagnetic field that had interfered with everyone's health and technology, causing hallucinations and malfunctions. I finally understood that the number had never been real. But the trauma it had inflicted on me was.
