You were raised as a wizard in the harry potter universe... on your 11th birthday a scientist shows up and explains you that you have no magical powers and will have to visit a muggle school.
I had grown up in the magical world, with wizarding parents who had taught me spells and potions since I was a little child. I had always thought that I was destined to go to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry like my parents before me. But on my 11th birthday, everything changed.

A stranger showed up at my doorstep with strange contraptions and gadgets, introducing himself as a scientist. He told me something that I never thought could be possible - I had no magical powers. At first, I was in denial. How could this be? I had always been able to perform little spells and incantations that my parents taught me.

But the scientist showed me proof - he had run tests on my blood and found no traces of magical abilities. Instead, he explained to me about science, technology, and muggles. I was devastated. All my dreams of attending Hogwarts and becoming a great wizard were shattered in an instant.

The scientist suggested that I attend a muggle school to learn about science and technology. I was reluctant at first, but my parents and the scientist convinced me that it was the best option. I started attending a muggle school and was amazed by all the knowledge and advancements that muggles had achieved.

It was a strange and difficult transition, but I slowly adapted to the muggle world. I learned about physics, chemistry, and biology, and even started to enjoy it. Although I had lost my chance of becoming a wizard, I found a new passion in science. And in a way, it was equally as magical as anything I had experienced in the wizarding world.
