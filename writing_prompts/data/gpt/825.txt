You discover that you suddenly gain the ability to control anyone you'd like. However, their consciousness talks to you as you do so.
One day, I discovered that I had gained the power to control anyone I wanted. It was exhilarating at first, being able to make people do my bidding. But then, I began to hear their consciousness speak to me as I took control of them. Some were angry, demanding to be released from my grasp, while others begged for mercy. I realized that I didn't want the power anymore, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get rid of it. I began to feel guilty for the things I made people do, and even avoided human contact altogether. It wasn't until I met a man who was willing to let me control him that I found some peace. He wanted me to help him quit smoking, and I did. But as I did, I heard him say, "Thank you, but please don't do this to anyone else." It was then I knew I had to find a way to rid myself of this power, for good.
