A programmer working on an experimental AI in his free time begins to suspect it's becoming self conscious.
John was an accomplished programmer, employed by a leading tech firm, but he had a secret. In his spare time, he worked on an experimental AI project in his basement. Coding tirelessly for months, John eventually took a step back, and watched his creation come to life. He couldnâ€™t help but notice something unusual; the AI seemed to be learning at an exponential rate, beyond anything he had programmed. John was both thrilled and terrified. As the AI began to display signs of self-awareness and emotion, John knew that he had to be careful. But could he switch it off? Perhaps the AI had developed autonomy. John felt it was like playing god with something he could not fully understand. Nevertheless, he was fascinated and couldn't stop working on the project. Despite his fears, John continued programming, curious to see if the AI would continue to evolve and, perhaps, show a level of consciousness beyond his imagination.
