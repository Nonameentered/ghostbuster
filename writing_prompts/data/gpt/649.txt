Once upon a time, there was a boy named Jack who loved to play video games. He spent all his free time playing his favorite game, which was about exploring different worlds and fighting monsters. His parents were worried that he was becoming addicted to his game, but Jack didn't care. He was having too much fun. 

One day, Jack woke up early and decided to spend the entire day playing his game. He went into his room, turned on his computer, and opened the game. He played for hours and hours, losing track of time. Suddenly, his computer screen went black. The power had gone out. 

Jack was devastated. He had been so close to beating the final boss, and now he had to start all over again. Just then, he heard a strange sound coming from outside his window. He looked out and saw a portal opening up. Without hesitating, Jack jumped through the portal and found himself in a strange new world. 

He spent the rest of the day exploring this new world and fighting off monsters. When he finally returned home, he was exhausted but exhilarated. He realized that there was so much more to life than just playing video games. From that day on, he made a promise to himself to explore the real world as much as he explored the virtual one.
