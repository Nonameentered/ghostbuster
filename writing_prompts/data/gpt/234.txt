There's someone in my head but it's not me.
There's someone in my head but it's not me.

I woke up one day and I felt like I was not alone in my head. There was a voice, whispering things that I could barely make out. It was like a chorus of whispers, murmurs and hums in my mind.

At first, I thought it was just my imagination so I tried to ignore it. But it persisted, and it started to get louder and more forceful. Every time I tried to focus, it would start whispering again.

One day, I decided to confront it. The voice was not mine, but it sounded familiar. It was like I had heard it before, but where?

It was then that I realized whose voice it was. It was my grandfather's. He had passed away a few years ago, but it was like he was still with me, guiding me, pushing me.

With him in my head, I felt stronger, more confident, and more sure of myself. He was helping me through the difficult times in my life, and I was grateful for it.

Now, whenever I feel lost or alone, I remember that there's someone in my head but it's not me. It's my grandfather, watching over me and guiding me on my journey.
