There was always something mysterious about Mr. Johnson, my history teacher. He never seemed to age, and his knowledge of history was unparalleled. But it wasn't until I noticed a strange symbol on his wrist that my suspicions were confirmed. The same symbol that had been found on ancient artifacts and in historical texts.

I started to pay closer attention in his classes and noticed that he would sometimes share details that weren't in any of our textbooks. Details that could have only been gleaned from someone who had lived it.

As I delved deeper, I discovered that Mr. Johnson had been a part of some of the most significant events in history, from the American Revolution to World War II. He had rubbed shoulders with presidents and monarchs, and witnessed the rise and fall of empires.

Despite this, Mr. Johnson remained humble and never boasted about his experiences. Instead, he focused on sharing his passion for history and encouraging his students to explore the past.

After graduating, I tried to find Mr. Johnson again, but he had disappeared. Some say he retired, while others think he may have moved on to another school. But I like to think that he's still out there, watching history unfold, and passing on his knowledge to those who seek it.
