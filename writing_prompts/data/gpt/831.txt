The aliens we made first contact with lived entirely on tasteless, simple food. So enamored with our food, we've found that we can even control them with our supreme culinary prowess. You have a couple alien friends, but you also happen to be a terrible cook.
Ever since humans made first contact with the aliens, we learned that these extraterrestrial beings had a peculiar taste palate. The aliens would only eat tasteless, simple food, like plain white rice, boiled potatoes, and bland bread. They didn't even show any interest in seasoning or adding flavors to their food. This information piqued the interest of the culinary world, and chefs from all over the world had flocked to the alien's spaceships to prepare their food.

The aliens were fascinated by our cuisine, and their obsession with our food led us to discover something incredible. We found out that we could control the aliens with our supreme culinary prowess. We could persuade the aliens to assist us with anything we wanted in return for our food. It was like food had become the currency of intergalactic alliance. This discovery had put humanity in a powerful position, but I felt uneasy about it.

Despite the tremendous discovery, I was still just a guy who loved mediocre food. I had no interest in cooking or even eating gourmet meals, but I had somehow managed to befriend two aliens. They were named Zix and Gox, and they had a keen interest in humans. They found us fascinating and wanted to learn all about our culture and way of life. In return, they taught me their alien language and shared their wisdom with me.

One day while hanging out with Zix and Gox, I realized something terrible. I had nothing to offer them in terms of food. I barely knew how to make something edible, let alone something that would impress their taste buds. I had tried my hand at a few recipes, but it always ended in disaster. I couldn't even boil an egg correctly.

Zix and Gox were fond of me, and they never showed any disappointment or displeasure with my culinary skills. But deep down, I knew I was letting them down. I wanted to show them that I valued their friendship and that I was capable of cooking something delicious for them.

I decided to seek help from a chef friend of mine who had been cooking for the aliens. My friend was hesitant to teach me anything as he knew that I was a terrible cook. But I convinced him somehow, and he taught me a simple recipe that he promised would be a hit with the aliens. I practiced that same recipe for several days until I was confident that I had gotten it right.

The day had finally come for me to showcase my newfound cooking skills to Zix and Gox. I presented them with my dish, and their eyes widened with excitement. They took a bite, and to my surprise, they loved it. They ate every last bite and asked for more. I was thrilled.

Over the following days and weeks, I continued to cook for Zix and Gox, and each time I improved my skills. I started to enjoy cooking, and it became a passion. The aliens, too, were delighted with my cooking and frequently requested to taste new dishes from me.

I may have been a terrible cook once, but with time and practice, I had become a decent chef, and I owed it all to Zix and Gox. Their presence and influence in my life had sparked a newfound love for cooking within me. And for that, I will forever be grateful.
