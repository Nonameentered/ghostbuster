Once upon a time, there was a little boy who wanted to learn how to eat an apple. He had seen his friends do it effortlessly, but every time he tried, he ended up biting into the core or swallowing a seed.

One day, he went to his grandfather and asked him to teach him how to eat an apple. His grandfather smiled and brought out two apples. One was shiny and red, and the other was brown and shriveled.

"Do you know the difference between these two apples?" his grandfather asked.

The boy shook his head.

"This shiny apple is fresh and full of life, while the shriveled apple is old and tired. Just like people, apples come in different forms. It's not about the appearance, but the essence inside," the grandfather said.

The boy was amazed. He had never thought of things that way before.

They continued to talk about different things, like the seasons, nature, and the cycles of life. As they talked, they shared the apples, and the boy finally learned how to eat an apple. But more than that, he had learned so much more from his grandfather's wisdom.

From that day on, the little boy looked at the world differently. He saw the beauty in everything, no matter their appearance. And every time he ate an apple, he remembered the important life lessons his grandfather had taught him.
