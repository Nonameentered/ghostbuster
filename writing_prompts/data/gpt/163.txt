When Andy entered the room with a gun in his hand, Mary knew right away that something wasn't right. She had always known that he had a dark side, but she never thought that he would actually hurt her. As the gun went off, Mary had no time to react. Everything went black, and then suddenly, there were images flashing before her eyes.

She saw herself as a little girl, playing with dolls and running around in the park. She saw her wedding day, and the birth of her first child. Every moment of her life was replaying before her eyes in vivid detail, as if she was living it all over again.

But as she moved further along, the memories became more painful. She saw the fights she had with Andy, and the moments when he would lash out at her in anger. She saw the bruises and the broken bones, and everything he had done to hurt her.

Suddenly, she found herself standing in a dark room, facing Andy. He was holding the gun, and she knew that he was the reason why she was seeing all of these memories.

As he pulled the trigger, Mary closed her eyes, waiting for the end. But instead of darkness, she saw a bright light, and then she was standing in an open field, free from all the pain and suffering she had experienced in life.
