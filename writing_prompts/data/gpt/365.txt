When he was a child, Jack used to think that the world at night was a magical, mystical place full of secrets and wonders. He loved lying in bed with his curtains open, gazing up at the stars and imagining all the adventures he could have if only he was allowed to stay up late.

Of course, as he got older, Jack learned the truth about what really happened at night. He learned about criminals lurking in the darkness, about parties and bars and people doing things they regretted in the morning. He learned that the world at night was not a place for children.

But Jack never forgot the feeling of wonder he had as a child. Whenever he had trouble sleeping, he would sneak out of bed and slip into the night. He would walk through the quiet streets, looking up at the sky and feeling like he was the only person in the world.

One night, Jack was walking through the park when he heard a sound behind him. He turned around to see a little girl standing there, looking up at him with big, curious eyes.

"What are you doing out so late?" she asked.

"I'm just...enjoying the night," Jack said, feeling a little nervous. He wasn't used to being caught out like this.

The girl nodded. "I like the night too," she said. "But my dad says it's not safe for me to be out here by myself."

Jack frowned. "He's probably right. You should go home and go to bed."

But the girl didn't move. She just looked up at Jack with a stubborn expression that reminded him of himself as a child. "I'm not scared," she said. "And I want to see what happens at night."

Jack hesitated. He knew he should tell her to go home, but there was something in her eyes that made him remember that feeling of wonder he used to have. Maybe he could show her something magical, something that would make her love the night as much as he did.

"Okay," he said. "But I'll stay with you."

Together, they walked through the park, watching as the stars overhead grew brighter and more numerous. Jack pointed out the constellations he knew, and the girl listened intently, asking questions and giggling at the funny shapes they made.

Finally, they reached the edge of the park, and the girl let out a sigh. "I guess we should go home now," she said.

Jack nodded, feeling a sense of contentment he hadn't felt in a long time. He had shown this girl something beautiful, something that she would remember for years to come.

As they walked back through the quiet streets, Jack realized that maybe he did know the difference between a child and an adult. Children saw magic in the world because they didn't know any better. Adults saw magic in the world because they knew just how rare and precious it truly was.
