It was 3:35 am when the sirens jolted me out of my sleep, and I sat up in bed, disoriented and groggy. I rubbed my bleary eyes and glanced around my room, trying to figure out what was going on. A quick glance at my phone illuminated the notification screen, and my heart jumped into my throat.

Last bookings for the escape spaceships close at 3:50 am.

My mind raced as I scrambled out of bed, the cool wooden floor sending shivers down my spine. I had read about the escape spaceships in the news over the past few days, and it seemed like something straight out of a science-fiction novel.

Apparently, the world was going to end. A massive asteroid was hurtling towards Earth, and there was nothing anyone could do to stop it. Scientists had calculated the trajectory and estimated that it would hit in less than twenty-four hours, destroying everything in its path and causing worldwide destruction.

But there was hope. A group of wealthy people had constructed a set of spaceships that had the capability of escaping Earth's atmosphere and journeying into space. The ships were supposed to carry a limited number of people to a new planet, where they would start a new life and escape the cataclysmic end of our world. However, the catch was that there were only a few spaceships available, and the booking slots were quickly filling up.

I had never seriously considered booking a place on one of these escape spaceships. It seemed like something that was beyond the realm of possibility for me. But now, with less than fifteen minutes left until the last bookings closed, I was face to face with a decision that could mean the difference between life and death.

I fumbled with my phone, scrolling through the booking portal and entering my details as quickly as possible. The clock ticked down, and I felt a sense of panic rising inside me. The booking form asked me for my address, my age, and my occupation. I knew that the selection process was going to be competitive and that my chances of securing a place might be slim. But I filled out the form anyway, pressing submit just as the clock struck 3:50 am.

My heart was racing as I waited for the confirmation message to arrive. I sat on the edge of my bed, staring at my phone screen as seconds ticked by. The sirens outside had quietened down, and there was an eerie silence outside my window. It was as if the world was waiting for something to happen.

Finally, the confirmation message arrived. "Congrats! You have secured a place on escape spaceship number 7. Please report to the designated shuttle location by 5 am."

I let out a sigh of relief, knowing that I had made it through to the next stage. But my joy was shortlived as a sense of responsibility and urgency took over. I realized that I had to pack up my life and leave everything behind in just a few short hours. I quickly pulled out a suitcase and started throwing in clothes and essentials, not knowing what I would need in the future but packing everything just in case.

It was strange to think that this was it. This was the end. I felt a sense of sadness as I walked through my apartment, knowing that I would probably never see my home again. But at the same time, I felt a sense of excitement. This was a new beginning, an opportunity to start fresh and build a new life in a new world.

As I raced to the shuttle location, I saw many people out on the streets. People were huddled in groups, some crying and some in a state of shock. There were scenes of chaos everywhere, with police officers and emergency personnel trying to maintain order amidst the panic.

At the shuttle location, I was met with a sea of people. The place was a hive of activity, with people rushing around, lugging suitcases and bags, and trying to find their way to their designated spaceship. I stood in line, clutching my suitcase and feeling a sense of trepidation as I caught sight of the massive spaceship looming ahead.

It was surreal to think that I was about to embark on a journey to an unknown planet, with no idea what was waiting for me on the other side. But that was the price of survival, and I was willing to pay it. As I boarded the spaceship and found my assigned cabin, I took a deep breath and tried to calm my nerves.

The spaceship was massive, with multiple levels and state-of-the-art facilities. I wandered around and explored, marvelling at the technology and design of the ship. It was as if I had stepped into a movie, and it was hard to believe that this was real.

As the engines fired up and we began to lift off into space, I watched as my world disappeared beneath me. I felt a pang of sadness, knowing that I was leaving behind everything I had ever known. But at the same time, I felt liberated. This was a new beginning, a fresh start, and I was ready to embrace it.

As the journey wore on, I started to meet other passengers and forge new connections. We were a group of strangers, thrown together by the fate of our planet, but we were all united by the hope for a better future. There were people of all ages and nationalities - families with young children, elderly couples, and solo travellers like me. But there was no sense of elitism or social hierarchy. We were all in this together, and we all had the same chance of survival.

There were moments of fear and uncertainty. We encountered a few close calls as we navigated through asteroid fields and space debris, and there were times when the engines flickered or the lights flickered. But each time, the crew was quick to respond, and we were assured that we were in good hands.

As we neared our destination, there was a growing sense of anticipation and excitement. We knew that we were about to land on a new planet, and our new lives would begin. The ship began its descent, and we were all strapped in, jostling with excitement and nerves.

Finally, with a resounding thud, the spaceship landed on the new planet's surface. As we emerged from the cabin, we were met with a landscape that was breathtakingly beautiful. The sky was a deep shade of purple, and the stars shone brighter than ever before. The air was crisp and fresh, and there was a sense of vitality and energy that I had never experienced before.

As we journeyed towards our new settlement, I felt a sense of awe and wonder. This was a new world, a new beginning, and I was filled with the hope and promise of a new life. I knew that it would be challenging to start over, that there would be obstacles and hurdles to overcome. But I was ready for it. I had survived the end of the world and had been given a second chance to make something of myself.

The journey had been a long and treacherous one, but it had been worth it. I had left behind my old life and embarked on a new adventure, one that was filled with endless possibilities. As I looked up at the purple sky and the shining stars, I knew that I was home.
