Write a story where the point of view changes every paragraph.
The sun was setting on the tiny town of Millfield as Sarah made her way down Main Street. She had always loved the way the light shone through the trees at this time of day, casting golden shadows along the pavement. The people she passed on the way all looked familiar - the friendly woman who ran the bakery, the old man who sat outside the library with his dog.

As she reached the end of the street, she heard the faint sound of a guitar strumming in the distance. Curiosity piqued, Sarah headed in the direction of the music. She soon found herself standing outside the local bar, where a young man with tousled hair and a worn guitar was crooning a ballad. Despite the roughness of his voice, Sarah found herself drawn to the melancholy melody.

Inside the bar, the scene was different. The air was thick with cigarette smoke and the sound of clinking glasses. A group of rowdy locals were huddled around a dartboard, shouting and cheering with each throw. Sarah felt out of place amidst the noise and commotion.

But then she caught the eye of a handsome man across the room. He gave her a smile and a nod, and Sarah felt a flutter in her stomach. She made her way over to him, trying to ignore the stares of the other patrons.

"Hi," he said, offering his hand. "I'm Jack."

Sarah smiled back at him, feeling a warmth spread through her. "Sarah," she replied. "Nice to meet you."

For a moment, they just stood there, their hands clasped together. Sarah felt a sudden surge of hope, as if anything was possible in this moment.

And then the next paragraph began, and Sarah was gone. The scene shifted once again, and Jack was no longer the focus. The point of view changed, and the story continued.
