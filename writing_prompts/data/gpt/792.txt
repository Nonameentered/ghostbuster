The bloodiest black Friday to ever occur happens. Millions are dead. The malls are bloodbaths. Tell me more about it.
It was supposed to be a day of celebration, the biggest shopping day of the year. But nobody could have predicted the horrors that would occur on that fateful Black Friday.

At the stroke of midnight, stores across the country opened their doors to hordes of shoppers, eager to snag the best deals. But amongst the throngs of bargain-hunters were a few individuals who had a much different agenda.

Without warning, they started attacking anyone in their path. Assault rifles and other weapons were pulled out, and the chaos erupted. Screams filled the air as bullets rang out, hitting innocent people who were simply trying to shop.

The first reports of the massacre came in just minutes after the stores opened. By then, it was too late. The killers were already inside, wreaking havoc and causing destruction.

One mall, in particular, became the epicenter of the violence. It was supposed to be a festive atmosphere, with Christmas carols playing and families browsing for gifts. But instead, it quickly turned into a bloodbath.

The attackers moved in coordinated waves, cutting off exits and trapping shoppers inside. Those who tried to run were mowed down. It was like a warzone, with bullets flying from all directions.

The mall security was no match for the heavily armed assailants, who had apparently planned this attack for weeks. They seemed to have a specific target - anyone who was seen carrying expensive shopping bags.

The shoppers tried to hide in stores, under tables, and behind counters. But the attackers were relentless, going from store to store, hunting down their victims. Soon, the floors were slick with blood, and the screams of the dying mingled with the cries of the living.

As news of the attack spread, law enforcement agencies from all over the country mobilized to respond. But it took hours for them to arrive at the scene, and by then, the damage had already been done.

By the end of Black Friday, the death toll was staggering. Millions of people had either been killed or injured in the violence, and the country was left in a state of shock.

The aftermath of the attack was even more disturbing than the attack itself. Families mourned the loss of their loved ones, while the government struggled to find a way to prevent such tragedies from happening again.

Questions abounded about who was behind the massacre, and what could have motivated such a horrific act of violence. Some suggested it was a terrorist attack, while others believed it was a group of anti-capitalist extremists.

What was clear, however, was that the country would never be the same again. Black Friday, once a day of massive sales and excited shoppers, had forever been stained by the blood of those who died that day.

The malls where the attack occurred were closed down, almost as if they were cursed. And for many years, people would avoid going to any shopping center on Black Friday, haunted by the memories of that dark day when so many lives were lost.

It took several years for the government to enact new laws and regulations aimed at preventing future attacks. Metal detectors and armed security guards were installed in every mall, and there were strict limits on the number of people allowed inside at any given time.

But even with these measures in place, people still remembered the horror of the last Black Friday, and many simply could not bring themselves to join the crowds again.

The bloodiest Black Friday in history would forever be a reminder of the fragility of our sense of security, and a testament to the evil that lurks in the hearts of some individuals.
