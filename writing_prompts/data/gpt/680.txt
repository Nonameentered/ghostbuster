You and your wife decide to try a new Christmas tradition for the kids called Elf On The Shelf. After a week of you and your wife playing and moving the elf around, you start to notice the elf moves to different places at night by itself. You ask the kids if they been moving it, they say no.
Ever since our kids were born, my wife and I made sure that we would do everything in our power to make their Christmas a special and memorable one. As they grew up, we started incorporating little traditions into our holiday season, and this year we decided to try out something called 'Elf on the Shelf.'

For those who don't know, Elf on the Shelf is a children's book that comes with a toy elf. The elf is supposed to keep an eye on the kids and report back to Santa every night. Each morning, the elf appears in a new spot around the house, and the kids have to search for it.

My wife and I had read the story to our children, and they were thrilled to have this little toy elf as their new friend. The first day, we introduced them to the elf and named him Jingles. We told them the rules- they couldn't touch him, and they had to be on their best behavior because Jingles would be reporting to Santa every night.

The first few days went by with no excitement, but as the week wore on, things began to get strange. My wife and I played with Jingles, moving him around the house and putting him in funny poses for the kids to find. But when we woke up the next morning, the elf was in a completely different spot from where we left him.

At first, we thought that one of the kids might have moved him, but they swore that they didn't touch Jingles. We brushed it off as being forgetful and just picked up the toy elf, putting him in a new place each morning, just like we did before.

However, the strange movements of the elf continued, and we grew increasingly panicked. Who could be moving the elf? Had someone broken into our house and was playing some kind of twisted game with us?

One night, I decided to set up a camera to see what was happening. I placed the camera in the living room, near where Jingles had last been seen. My wife and I went to bed, anxious to see what we would find in the morning.

When we woke up, we checked the footage, and our jaws dropped. There, on the screen, we saw the elf move by itself. It was as if the toy had come to life, its eyes glowing in the dark as it tiptoed across the room and into a new spot.

We were terrified, but we didn't want to scare our kids. So we decided to keep the camera rolling, determined to solve this mystery.

The next night, we watched the footage again, and to our shock, we saw that the elf had moved again, this time without anyone in sight. My wife and I were speechless. We had no explanation for what was happening.

The next day, we asked our kids to tell us the truth. "Are you sure you didn't move Jingles?" we asked.

"No, we didn't touch him," they replied.

We didn't know what to do, but we knew we couldn't explain this away as a coincidence. We had to act fast before anything worse happened. So, we decided to pack Jingles up and send him back to the North Pole.

We still have no idea what happened with Jingles, and we never tried the 'Elf on the Shelf' tradition again. It remains a mystery, but one thing is sure- that Christmas was one we would never forget.
