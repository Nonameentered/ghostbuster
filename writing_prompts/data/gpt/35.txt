I have lived a million lifetimes, seen empires rise and fall, watched as civilizations crumbled to dust, and witnessed history unfold before my very eyes. I have lived for thousands of years, yet I have never been discovered, and I intend to keep it that way. So, when I boarded the generation ship, the Ark, for a 2,000-year journey across the stars, I knew that keeping my immortality secret would be a daunting task.

As I stepped onto the ship, I was met with the usual hustle and bustle of a long journey. Families were reuniting, friends were saying tearful goodbyes, and children were running around with excitement. But no one had any idea that I would be spending the next 2,000 years with them. I blended in with the crowd as I made my way to my chamber, which was nothing more than a tiny room that would be my home for the entirety of the voyage.

I knew that 2,000 years was a long time to spend with anyone, let alone a group of people who did not know my secret. I had seen generation ships like this before, but I never had the patience to take the journey. However, this time I felt different, and I knew that I had to be a part of this journey. And so, I joined the thousands of people on the Ark, and we set off into the great unknown.

The first few decades were easy enough. I stayed in my tiny room, only venturing out when necessary. I lived on the rations provided, and I slept for days on end to keep my mind from going insane with the monotony of it all. As the years passed, I began to start conversations with the other inhabitants of the ship, but I couldn't bring myself to form real connections with any of them. I couldn't bear the thought of them finding out my secret.

As the centuries went by, I found myself living for the small moments that made life worth living - the beauty of a sunrise, the laughter of a child, the warmth of a hug. But my secret weighed heavily on me, for I knew that as the voyage went on, the chances of me being discovered would increase.

As the millenniums passed, I watched the inhabitants of the Ark come and go. People died, and life went on. I remained as I always had, quiet and unassuming, yet watching everything around me. And now, here I am, watching as we approach our destination. It's been a long journey, and I've seen it all.

But as I step off the ship and onto the new world we've discovered, I know that my secret will become harder and harder to keep. The people here will ask questions, and they will want to know who I am, and why I look so young. I smile to myself, knowing that I will have to reinvent myself once again. But for now, I stand on the precipice of a new beginning, the immortal who has seen it all and has much to learn.
