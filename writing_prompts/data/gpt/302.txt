A stupid fucking mug with my name on it.
I never wanted that stupid fucking mug with my name on it. It was a shallow attempt at a gift from my ex-boyfriend, Mike. We had been together for two years and he knew how much I loved tea. So he decided to give me a mug with my name on it.

At first, I thought it was cute. But when I saw the word "Amanda" written in bold, capital letters, I knew it was anything but cute. I mean, who writes a name like that? It made me cringe every time I saw it.

But I was grateful to have a boyfriend who wanted to bring joy to my life. That was until he started to get possessive. He would call me every hour to check in on me, and he would get angry when I went out with friends without him.

It wasn't until I found out he was cheating on me that I realized how stupid that fucking mug really was. I threw it out the window, shattering it on the pavement below. I was done with him and his shallow attempts at showing that he cared.

It may have been just a mug, but it represented so much more. It represented a time in my life when I was trying to make things work with someone who didn't care about me as much as I cared about him.

I moved on from Mike and that stupid fucking mug. I found someone who loves me for who I am and doesn't try to change me or make me feel inferior. And if anyone in my life ever decides to give me a gift with my name on it, they better make sure it's not written in bold, capital letters.
