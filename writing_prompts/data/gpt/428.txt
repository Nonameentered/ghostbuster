Two Timers Incorporated is the Ashley Madison of the future, helping their clients establish secret affairs with people from a different times in history without getting caught. It was the perfect system, a cheater's paradise- until the unexpected occurred.
Two Timers Incorporated had revolutionized the cheating game. They offered their clients an opportunity to cheat on their partners with people from a different time- and without the fear of getting caught. It was a marketer's paradise- soon, thousands of people swarmed to the website, enticed by the tantalizing prospect of extramarital affairs without the risk of repercussions.

The process, they said, was foolproof. The website offered a range of services, from the selection of a partner from a different time to the very specific details of making the affair seem like an entirely plausible experience for the cheater. The rules were simple- to establish a stable connection to their "past" lovers, the clients needed to be hooked to Two Timers' advanced time machines. The results, as they promised, were phenomenal. Soon, they had even developed a mechanism to erase the client's memories of their experience- ensuring that no one would ever suspect what really went down.

The entire concept of Two Timers seemed too good to be true. But people paid huge sums of money to take advantage of the service anyways. Some of them, heartbroken and seeking an escape from a failed marriage. Others simply wanted to spice up their mundane lives.

One such client, Martin, had subscribed to Two Timers, convinced that it was the ultimate solution to his growing disillusionment with his wife. He was bored by the monotony of his life, and the idea of exploring a different time with a woman from the history of his choice seemed like an adventure worth taking.

His experience, at first, was mind-blowing. The time machine had transported him to the 1920s, where he had spent an incredible time indulging in a forbidden romance with a beautiful young woman. It was thrilling- a lifestyle that he had never even imagined living. The affair had given him a refreshing perspective on life. He had completely forgotten about his wife in the real world.

But it seemed too good to last forever, and one day, everything changed.

As he lay in bed with his lover in his chosen period, Martin heard a strange noise. It sounded like a mechanical whir- the sound of the machine that transported him here. He panicked, realizing that he was trapped in the past with no way back. It was a bizarre experience- something that he had never anticipated. He tried to come back to the future- but the machine was unresponsive.

He was stuck in an entirely different era, with no hope of returning to his real-world. The beautiful woman whom he had come to love so dearly- she would never be real in the world he belonged to. Martin felt an overwhelming sense of despair- he had traded his real life for a dream that had become his nightmare.

It was only later that he discovered the truth about Two Timers Incorporated. The service, in all its promises of secrecy and the perfect affair, had hidden a brutal and heartbreaking reality. All the clients, who had once been so invested in their virtual affairs, had been conned by the company. There was no way back to reality. No escape from their own delusions.

Martin spent the rest of his days- or what remained of them in the wrong century- fighting for his survival, trapped in an era he did not belong in. He had been betrayed by the very service that had promised him a fantastic, life-changing experience. The thrill of the extramarital affairs- it stood dwarfed next to the crippling reality of his new existence.

It seemed like the perfect solution- Two Timers Incorporated, but the truth was far from it. The company's shady practices had shattered the lives of a million people, rendering them helpless and alone in a different time. But the cheats, who had once sought refuge in the service, had no idea that they had opened the door to their own destruction.
