During the final days of World War 3 a group of soldiers discover an item of near mythical rarity- a pack of smokes, still in the cellophane.
It was the final days of World War 3, and the world was in utter chaos. The battlefield was a mass grave, littered with the bodies of fallen soldiers. The remaining troops were exhausted and starving, and hope was nowhere to be found.

But amongst the rubble and destruction, a group of soldiers had stumbled upon something that gave them a glimmer of hope- a pack of smokes, still in the cellophane. It was a rare and precious find. In a world where luxuries were long forgotten, a pack of cigarettes was a treasure.

The group of soldiers, consisting of four men and one woman, sat huddled together in the bombed-out ruins of what used to be a hotel. They were filthy, their clothes were tattered, and their weapons were in disrepair. They had been fighting for survival for so long that they had forgotten what it was like to live.

The pack of smokes had been discovered by the group's leader, Captain Mitchell. He had been rummaging through the debris of a destroyed convenience store when he had come across the cigarettes, buried beneath a pile of rubble. He couldn't believe his luck. It was as if fate had thrown him a lifeline.

Captain Mitchell lit one of the cigarettes and took a long drag. He closed his eyes in ecstasy, savoring the taste of the tobacco as it filled his lungs. The smoke was thick and pungent, and it filled the air with a bittersweet aroma.

The other soldiers watched him, their eyes gleaming with envy. They had all been rationing their cigarettes for months, and some of them had run out completely. The thought of smoking a fresh cigarette was irresistible.

"What's it like?" asked Private Collins, staring intently at the cigarette in Captain Mitchell's hand.

"It's like heaven," replied Captain Mitchell, taking another drag. "You forget all your troubles and just enjoy the moment."

Private Collins looked wistful. "I can't even remember the last time I had a cigarette," he said.

The other soldiers nodded in agreement. They had all been through so much together- the battles, the terror, the loss. But in that moment, smoking that cigarette was the only thing that mattered. It was their little piece of happiness, their escape from the horrors around them.

As Captain Mitchell passed the cigarette to the next soldier, a sudden explosion shook the building. The soldiers leaped to their feet, weapons at the ready. They had learned to be constantly on edge, always expecting the worst.

But the explosion had come from outside- someone had detonated a bomb in the street. The soldiers cautiously peered out of the window and saw a group of enemy soldiers advancing towards them. They were heavily armed and clearly intent on killing them.

Captain Mitchell turned to his troops. "We have to move, now," he said. "Grab what you can and let's go."

They quickly gathered their gear and hurried out of the building, taking care to avoid the enemy soldiers. They ran through the streets, slinking past ruined buildings and dodging enemy fire. Their only goal was to make it to safety.

As they ran, the pack of cigarettes jostled inside Captain Mitchell's pocket, a small comfort in the midst of chaos. Suddenly, the soldier carrying the pack tripped on a piece of rubble, and the pack went flying out of his hand.

Captain Mitchell watched in horror as the pack skidded across the pavement and came to a stop just inches away from an enemy soldier. The soldier looked down at it in surprise, a glint of recognition in his eyes. He knew exactly what it was- a pack of smokes, still in the cellophane.

For a moment, the world stood still. Both groups of soldiers stared at the pack, frozen in time. It was as if the fate of the war rested on that one tiny item.

Then, suddenly, the enemy soldier reached down and grabbed the pack. He hesitated for a moment, looking at the soldiers before him. And then, he did something unexpected- he tossed the pack back towards Captain Mitchell.

"Smoke 'em if you got 'em," he said with a grin.

The soldiers watched in amazement as the enemy soldier walked away, leaving them with the precious pack of smokes. It was a small act of kindness in a world gone mad.

And so, the soldiers continued their journey, smoking their cigarettes and fighting for survival. But deep down, they knew that the pack of smokes would always be more than just a luxury. It was a symbol of hope, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is still some good left in the world.
