Two enter. Only... three can leave? Huh? How did that happen?
It all started as a simple game that Sandra and her friends decided to play one Saturday evening. They were all gathered at Sandra's house and were a little bored with the usual games they played. So, one of them suggested they try an escape room game.

Sandra and her friends were really excited about this idea and immediately started planning the game. They set a few rules and decided to divide themselves into two teams. One team would be locked inside a room in Sandra's house, while the other team would be responsible for setting up the clues and puzzles.

As they started playing the game, Sandra's team found themselves locked in the room with a few clues and puzzles scattered around the room. They could hear their friends setting up the next clue outside the door, and they were determined to solve the puzzle and escape before the other team came in to take their place.

But, the game took an unexpected turn when Sandra's team discovered that they were not alone in the room. They found a hidden door that led to another room, and there they found a person who had been locked up for days. They were stunned and immediately called out to their friends outside the room.

In a hurry, the other team tried to open the door to rescue the stranger but found that it was locked from the other side. They quickly checked the clues that they had placed in the room and realized that there was a mistake in the game. The game was set up in such a way that only three people would be able to leave the house.

Sandra and her friends were shocked and didn't know what to do. They immediately tried to look for a way to rescue the stranger, but they could not find any clues or keys that could help them unlock the door. As the clock ticked away, they grew increasingly stressed and anxious about what would happen next.

Finally, one of the members of the team came up with an idea. They decided to break down the door to the other room using a hammer that they had found in the room. It was a risky move, but they were out of options.

They managed to break down the door and rescue the stranger who was grateful to them for their help. But, as they were about to leave the house, they realized that there were too many people to leave. They had six people in total, and the game had only been set up for three.

In the end, they decided that they would have to make the tough decision of leaving someone behind. They took a vote, and it was decided that the stranger would stay behind in the house while the others would leave. He agreed to this plan as he knew he would not have survived without their help.

They left the stranger behind and felt a deep sense of sadness as they walked away from the house. It was a haunting experience that none of them would forget. They had entered the house as friends, but only a few had left.

From that day on, Sandra and her friends never played any more escape room games. They learned that games could have unintended consequences and the stakes could be much higher than they had ever imagined. They promised that they would always be careful and think twice before playing any game.
