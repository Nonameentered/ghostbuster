Death is a supernatural being that nobody has ever seen. It's said that Death can only see one person at a time and that person is the one he must always kill. How does he choose his victim? Nobody knows.

One day, Death chose John as his next victim. John could sense something ominous about himself, and he knew that he was going to die soon. He went to see a psychic, hoping that she would tell him something that could help him.

"Death has chosen you as his next victim," the psychic said. John was terrified. He couldn't believe it was true.

Days passed, and John lived every moment cautiously, trying his best to avoid any danger. However, nothing seemed to work. It was like Death was always right behind him, waiting for the right moment to strike.

One night, John was walking alone when he saw Death walking towards him. He tried to run, but it was useless. Death was too fast. John knew that he had no hope left.

Suddenly, an idea popped into John's head. He quickly turned around and charged towards Death aimlessly. It was like he was trying to attack Death. Death was taken aback and didn't know what was happening. In that moment, John quickly moved past Death and continued running. Death was now confused and didn't know who to kill. John had outsmarted Death.

From that day on, John lived cautiously, always watching his back and staying vigilant. But he never forgot the time when he had outwitted Death. It was a close call and a lesson that he would always cherish.
