As soon as God finished creating the world and all its creatures, He knew He needed something to help Him relax. He knew that He was going to continue creating life and overseeing it all, and that task would need all His concentration. And so, as He sat on a cloud with the stars twinkling and the moon shining, God decided to roll a joint.

He had never tried marijuana before, but He had heard from some of his more adventurous creations that it had relaxing effects. He created a little marijuana plant on the spot and carefully harvested the leaves, like the gardener that He is. The plant was a perfect green, and the leaves were soft and fragrant. God knew this was going to be good.

As He lit up and puffed away, He noticed a strange sensation coming over Him. The world looked different, as if He was seeing it through a new pair of eyes. The colors were brighter, and the sounds surrounding Him were more vibrant. He felt His body slowly relaxing, and a sense of peace and joy began to anchor Him down. He laid back against the cloud and looked up at the sky, feeling grateful for the moment of peace He had found.

As He continued to smoke, however, He started to feel... off. He couldn't quite describe it, but He felt like He was losing His grip on everything around Him. As God started to spiral, He began to question the wisdom of smoking this joint. He had created everything in the world and was responsible for keeping everything in balance, yet here He was losing His grip on everything else. Was this why His creations warned Him that this might not be such a great idea?

Suddenly, God seemed to be transported to another world, a place where everything was flipped upside down, metaphorical and literal. Time lost meaning, the space around Him turned into a kaleidoscope of color, sound, and emotion, and He heard the voices of every person, every creature, every plant, and every mineral in the world begging Him to come back to help them. He tried to focus, to ground himself in reality, but it was impossible. His awareness expanded exponentially, and He felt like He could see through the veil of reality and glimpse the ineffable mysteries of the universe.

God struggled to gather Himself back together. The universe was racing, spiraling; time was collapsing, and He could hear the frantic whispers and cries of every single sentient being at once. He felt waves of fear, confusion, and helplessness swirling around Him, and it was all too much. He tried to stand up, but His body would not move. He was stuck in place, torn between the infinite and the finite, bouncing from one extreme to the other.

Eventually, after a few eternal moments, God finally pulled himself back together, or at least as much as He could. He took a deep breath, shook His head, and coughed. The world came back into focus, and everything began to slow down. The sky turned from a whirling mess of colors to its usual slow-moving pattern. As God looked down at the world below, He noticed that everything seemed a little clearer.

He had seen glimpses of his creations' sorrow and joy, and He finally began to understand them better than ever before. Now, with this new clarity, He could see how everything fit together, the way stories and lives and worlds are all weaving around each other into something bigger than the sum of their parts.

God carefully tossed the rest of the joint away and sat quietly for a few more minutes on the cloudy hilltop, reflecting on what He had just experienced. He felt grateful for the compassion and love He saw radiating from the hearts of his creations and decided to stay closer to them from now on and to make their lives on Earth balanced and peaceful.

As He returned to His heavenly abode, God knew that He would always remember His first and last time smoking a joint. It had provided Him with a rare insight into the lives of his creations and a profound and spiritual experience. God knew that He needed to continue learning from His creations, to continue to walk with them and care for them, and that was a lesson He would never forget.
