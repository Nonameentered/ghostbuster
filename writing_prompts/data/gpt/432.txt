It was my first day of work and I was determined to make a good impression. I had done my research, practiced my introductions and was ready to show off my skills. But from the moment I walked through the door, something felt off.

As I made my way through the office, I noticed people staring at me with a mix of confusion and reverence. I assumed they were just curious about the new guy, but something about their stares felt different. It wasn't until I reached my desk that I realized what was going on.

"Good morning, Mr. CEO," one of my coworkers greeted me with a smile.

I stared at him blankly. "I'm sorry?"

"You're the CEO, right? Doing some kind of undercover boss thing, I bet. That's why you're dressed like one of us."

I looked down at my business casual attire - a button-up shirt, slacks, and loafers - and realized that it was slightly fancier than what the rest of the employees were wearing. But still, the mistake seemed ridiculous.

"I'm not the CEO," I told him. "I'm just a new hire."

He laughed, clearly thinking I was being secretive for the sake of the job. "Sure thing, boss. I won't tell anyone."

I brushed off the exchange and focused on getting acclimated to my new role, but every interaction I had only confirmed my initial suspicion. Everyone, from my immediate team to upper management, treated me with a sense of respect and awe that was unwarranted.

Even the CEO themself didn't seem to catch on to the mistake. When they made their rounds to meet the new hires, they singled me out and asked me about my previous experience. They listened intently, nodding along to everything I said, as if my entry-level achievements were on par with their own.

It wasn't until the end of the day, when I was packing up to leave, that the truth finally came to light.

"Excuse me," someone called out to me from across the room. "I just wanted to say...we all think it's really cool what you're doing. It takes a lot of guts to go undercover like this. We're all excited to see what you learn and how you'll help improve the company."

I stared at him in disbelief. "I'm not undercover. I'm just me."

He looked confused for a moment before the realization set in. "Oh. Oh no. You're not, are you?"

As word spread throughout the office, my coworkers began to apologize, embarrassed by the mistake they had made. They all laughed it off, calling it a harmless mix-up, but I couldn't help feeling uneasy. If they all thought I was the CEO, what else would they assume about me? And how would that affect my work going forward?

Starting a new job is hard enough without the added pressure of being mistaken for someone else, but I was determined to prove myself. Who knows, maybe one day I'll actually earn that CEO title - but for now, I'll settle for proving my worth as a dedicated and capable employee.
