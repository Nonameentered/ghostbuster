A person is bragging about their time as a soldier. Being a veteran, you find out this person is a fake. You see him again bragging.
As a veteran, I have always been proud of my service in the military. I served in two different theaters of war, and although the memories were difficult, they were also formative for me. That’s why when I heard someone boasting about their time served, I couldn’t help but pay attention.

I was at a bar, nursing a beer when the man next to me struck up a conversation. He started talking about how he had served in Afghanistan and Iraq, and how he had come back to the US with a Purple Heart.

“Really?” I asked, my curiosity piqued. “What was your MOS?”

“MOS? Uh, 11 Bravo,” he replied, his eyes darting around nervously.

“Ah, so you were infantry?” I asked.

“Yeah, yeah, infantry. It was rough, man.”

I raised an eyebrow, sensing something was off about his story. “What was the name of your unit?”

He hesitated for a moment before answering. “Uh, 43rd Infantry Division.”

I knew for a fact that there was no 43rd Infantry Division, so I pressed further. “That’s interesting. I served in 3rd Infantry Division, I don’t remember ever hearing about the 43rd.”

“Uh, well, we were kind of like a special ops group,” he said, his voice faltering.

I decided to let it go, knowing that some people just liked to exaggerate their experiences for attention. But as the night wore on, he continued to boast about his service, and I grew increasingly annoyed.

The final straw came when he told a group of patrons that he had been awarded the Silver Star for valor in combat. I knew that this honor was not easily obtained and that it represented an incredible act of bravery. It was clear to me that this man was lying, and I decided to call him out on it.

“Excuse me,” I said, tapping him on the shoulder. “I couldn’t help but overhear you talking about your military service. I’m a veteran myself, and I have to say, some of the things you’re saying don’t add up.”

The man looked at me, his gaze icy. “What are you talking about?”

“Well, for starters, there’s no such thing as the 43rd Infantry Division. And the Silver Star, that’s a pretty big claim. Care to tell us which combat operation you received it for?”

The man stuttered for a moment before finally admitting, “Okay, fine, you got me. I never served. I just like to tell people that I did.”

I was taken aback by his confession. I had encountered people who exaggerated their military service before, but this was a complete fabrication.

“That’s pretty messed up,” I said, shaking my head. “There are real veterans out there who have put their lives on the line, and you’re pretending to be one of them for attention?”

The man shrugged, his expression unrepentant. “It’s just a joke. I didn’t think it was hurting anyone.”

“You’re wrong,” I replied firmly. “It’s disrespectful to those who have served, and it undermines the sacrifices that they’ve made.”

The man was clearly embarrassed by my chastisement, and he excused himself from the bar shortly after. I didn’t think I’d ever see him again, but fate had a funny way of working.

Several weeks later, I was walking through a park when I heard someone shouting. As I got closer, I realized it was the same man I had encountered at the bar, and he was once again boasting about his military service.

This time, he had a small crowd gathered around him, and his story had grown even more outlandish. He claimed to have been part of a secret CIA mission in North Korea, where he had single-handedly taken out a group of terrorists who were planning to launch an attack on US soil.

I couldn’t let this charade continue. I walked up to him, my anger simmering.

“Excuse me,” I said loudly. “Do you mind if I ask you a question about your time in the military?”

The man turned to me, his face paling as he recognized me from the bar.

“Uh, sure,” he said nervously.

“You’ve said some pretty incredible things about your service,” I said, my tone deadly serious. “But I happen to know that none of it is true. In fact, you never served a single day in the military.”

The man’s face fell, and he looked around, visibly uncomfortable. The small crowd that had gathered around him began to murmur amongst themselves, sensing that something was off.

“What are you talking about?” the man said, his voice faltering.

“I’m talking about the fact that you’re a liar,” I replied, my voice rising. “You’re lying to these people about your service record, and it’s disrespectful to the men and women who have actually served.”

The man began to back away, his eyes darting around wildly. “Hey, man, I didn’t mean any harm. It’s just a joke.”

I shook my head, my sense of justice overpowering any sympathy I might have felt for him. “It’s not a joke when you’re pretending to be a veteran for attention. You should be ashamed of yourself.”

The man turned and ran, disappearing into the crowd. I didn’t know if I’d ever see him again, but one thing was for sure: I wouldn’t be able to forget the way he had disrespected my fellow veterans.

As I walked away, I couldn’t help but feel a deep sense of disappointment. Being a veteran meant something to me, and seeing someone trivialize that experience for their own gain was heartbreaking. But even though I couldn’t change his behavior, I could at least call him out on it. And maybe, just maybe, he would think twice before pretending to be something he wasn’t in the future.
