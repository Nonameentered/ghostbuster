SatChat: Do you outline or just start writing?
Jessica sat down at her desk, ready to start her next writing project. She pulled up her Twitter app and saw that SatChat was trending. The writing community was discussing whether they outline their work or just start writing. 

She pondered the question for a moment before diving into the conversation. Some writers vehemently defended the use of outlines, while others claimed that writing spontaneously produces the best results. Jessica found herself agreeing with the latter group; she had always been more of a "pantser" than a planner. 

She started typing a response, explaining that she prefers to let the story take her where it needs to go. But as she typed, she felt a sudden jolt of inspiration. Characters and plot points flooded her mind, and she scrambled to jot them all down. 

From those notes, she started writing. It was a stream-of-consciousness approach that felt exhilarating. She didn't know where the story was taking her, but she was excited to find out. 

Hours turned into days as she feverishly typed away. The project started to take shape, and she felt the thrill of discovery with every word. By the time she finished, she knew that her approach had been the right one. 

For Jessica, outlining felt stifling. She needed the freedom to create and explore without limits. And in doing so, she had created something truly unique.
