When turning 21, everyone develops a mutation, either physical (Claws, horns, wings) or mental (telekinesis, extreme intelligence, etc ). You've just turned 21, and you're terrified of what you've gained (though others will be impressed ).
I had been dreading my 21st birthday for years. The day when everyone in our society received their mutation, either physical or mental. I always hoped that I would be one of the few unlucky ones who didn’t develop anything, but that hope was quickly shattered when I woke up on my birthday with a splitting headache and an unusual pulsing sensation in my temple.

I stumbled out of bed and stumbled into the bathroom, and as soon as I looked in the mirror, I knew that I wasn’t one of the few unlucky ones. My eyes had turned a bright neon green color, and my pupils had become slit-like. My skin had become a shade lighter, and I had a strange pattern of scales running down the back of my neck and along my arms.

I was terrified.

I tried to hide my mutation the best that I could, wearing long sleeves, gloves, and even sunglasses to cover up my eyes. But it wasn’t always easy, especially when I was out in public. People would stare, whisper, and even take pictures of me when they thought I wasn’t looking.

I knew that I couldn’t keep my mutation a secret forever. Eventually, I needed to face the reality of my situation, but I didn’t know how I was going to do it.

One day, I was at the park, sitting on a bench and watching the kids play. I was lost in my thoughts when a little girl approached me.

“Excuse me,” she said. “Are you a lizard person?”

I froze. I had never heard that term before, but it was clear that this little girl had seen through my attempts to hide my mutation.

“I… I don’t know,” I stuttered, unsure of what to say.

The little girl smiled. “Cool,” she said before running back to her parents.

I sat there for a long time, pondering her words. Cool? Was this something that I was supposed to be proud of? Despite my doubts, I found myself feeling a little more accepting of my mutation.

The next day, I went out in public without my sunglasses, and I felt a little more confident. People still stared and whispered, but I was starting to accept that this was just who I was now.

One day, I decided to take it a step further. I went to a costume shop and bought a pair of dragon wings. They were large and majestic, and they completed my look.

I strutted down the street, and I couldn’t believe the reactions that I was getting. People were applauding, cheering, and taking pictures. I was shocked that my mutation was being celebrated by so many people.

Eventually, I started to embrace my mutation fully. I entered contests, went to conventions, and even started a YouTube channel documenting my life as a lizard person.

It wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows, of course. There were still people who didn’t understand, who called me a freak or a monster. But they were the minority, and I knew that their opinions didn’t matter.

I had finally found my identity, and I was proud of it. It had taken me a while to accept my mutation, but now I couldn’t imagine my life without it. I was stronger, more confident, and more unique than I had ever been before.

In the end, I learned that being different wasn’t something to be ashamed of. It was something to be celebrated and cherished. I had gained something incredible on my 21st birthday, and I wouldn’t trade it for anything.
