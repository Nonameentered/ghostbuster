A naughty young wolf cries boy one too many times
Once upon a time, in a dense forest, there lived a mischievous young wolf. His name was Koda, and he loved to play pranks on the other animals in the forest. He would often pretend to be lost or injured, only to pounce on unsuspecting animals who came to his aid.

One day, while Koda was out playing, he saw a young boy wandering in the forest. The boy was alone and seemed lost. Koda got excited at the prospect of playing his favorite prank on someone new.

"Boy! Boy!" shouted Koda, hoping to catch the boy's attention.

The boy turned around and saw Koda. He was scared at first, but then he realized that Koda was just a young wolf and meant him no harm.

"What's your name?" asked Koda.

"I'm Tim," replied the boy.

Koda grinned mischievously. "Boy, come with me. I'll show you the way out of the forest."

Tim hesitated for a moment but then decided to trust Koda. He followed the wolf as he led him deeper into the forest. As they walked, Koda kept shouting "Boy! Boy!" to make sure that Tim was following him.

After a while, Tim started feeling uneasy. They seemed to be moving further away from the edge of the forest, not closer to it. He started questioning Koda about where they were going, but the wolf just kept leading him on.

Finally, Tim stopped and said, "I think we should go back. I'm not sure we should be going this way."

But Koda didn't listen. He was too busy enjoying himself to pay attention to the boy's words. He kept leading Tim on, shouting "Boy! Boy!" every few minutes.

As they continued on their journey, they suddenly came across a pack of angry wolves. The pack had heard Koda shouting "Boy! Boy!" and had assumed that the young wolf had caught a young boy for them to prey on.

Koda tried to explain that Tim was not his prey, but they wouldn't listen. The pack attacked Koda, and he barely managed to escape with his life.

Tim watched in horror as Koda was mauled by the pack. He felt guilty for trusting the wolf and following him into danger. He realized that Koda's pranks were not harmless, and he had learned his lesson the hard way.

For several days after the incident, Tim was too scared to leave his house. He didn't want to go anywhere near the forest. But eventually, his curiosity got the best of him, and he went back to the forest to explore.

As he entered the forest, he heard a faint cry of "Boy! Boy!" It was Koda, limping towards him.

Tim was surprised to see Koda alive and well. "What happened to you? Are you okay?" he asked.

Koda looked shamefaced as he replied, "I'm sorry, Tim. I shouldn't have played that prank on you. I didn't mean to put you in danger."

Tim forgave Koda, knowing that he had learned his lesson. He realized that Koda was just a young wolf who still had a lot to learn about the world.

From that day on, Koda stopped playing his mischievous pranks on the other animals in the forest. He became a trusted member of the pack, and they all learned to work together to survive.

Tim continued to visit the forest, and he and Koda became good friends. They would play together and explore the forest, but Koda never called Tim "Boy" again. He had learned that his pranks could have serious consequences, and he didn't want to risk hurting anyone again.

In the end, Koda's mischievous nature had taught him an important lesson about the consequences of his actions. He had learned to be more considerate of others and to think before he acted. And in doing so, he had become a better wolf and a better friend to Tim.
