That ringing noise people hear sometimes isn't a hallucination- in fact, it's much more sinister...
As Emily sat in her office, working away at her computer, she suddenly heard the ringing sound she had heard many times before. She had always assumed it was just her imagination or an auditory hallucination, but this time she was more curious than afraid.

As the ringing grew louder, she looked around and saw that her coworkers seemed to be ignoring it. In fact, they didn't seem to be able to hear it at all, which made Emily feel uneasy.

She decided to investigate the source of the sound and slowly made her way out of the office, following the noise. The ringing grew louder and more intense the further she walked, until she finally came to a dark, abandoned alleyway.

As she stepped into the alleyway, the ringing suddenly stopped, and everything was silent. But Emily could feel a presence watching her from the shadows. She felt a cold, clammy hand grab her wrist, and she was dragged into the darkness.

Emily never returned to the office and was never seen again. But her coworkers still hear the ringing noise from time to time, and they know now that it's not just a hallucination. It's something much more sinister, something that lurks in the darkness, waiting for its next victim.
