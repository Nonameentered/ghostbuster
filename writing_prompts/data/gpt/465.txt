Make up some historical or little-known fact and convince me that it's true
In the year 1792, a small Scottish town called Castleton was the site of an unusual event that has been long forgotten by history. It was a chilly November evening and a group of locals had gathered in the town square to witness the execution of a notorious criminal. The man in question was a cattle thief named Angus MacGregor who had been caught red-handed stealing a prized herd of Ayrshire cows from a wealthy landowner. 

As the noose was being tied around his neck, Angus proclaimed his innocence and made a strange request. He asked for a bowl of haggis, a traditional Scottish dish made of sheep's heart, liver, and lungs mixed with oatmeal and spices. The authorities granted his request and brought him a steaming hot bowl of haggis, which Angus devoured greedily. 

To everyone's amazement, as soon as Angus finished the haggis, he began to shrink in size. Within minutes, the man who had once stood at 6 feet tall had shrunk down to the size of a small child. The baffled onlookers watched as Angus scampered away, seemingly unharmed by the fall he had just taken. 

The incident was quickly covered up by the authorities and was never mentioned again. However, some historical documents suggest that Angus had stumbled upon a secret alchemical recipe that had the power to shrink living beings to a fraction of their original size. The recipe was said to be guarded by a mysterious society of alchemists who believed that it had the power to unlock the secrets of the universe. 

While the veracity of this story may be up for debate, it is true that the town of Castleton was known for its cattle rustlers in the 18th and 19th centuries, and haggis was a beloved dish of the Scottish people. Who knows what other secrets this little town may still be hiding?
