When I dream, I have two hands. It's a strange thing to say, but it's true. In my waking life, I lost my left arm in a car accident when I was twelve, and ever since, I've had to find ways to navigate the world with one hand. But when I dream, my left arm is back, as if the accident never happened.

At first, the dreams were unsettling. I would wake up feeling disoriented and incomplete, like a part of me was missing. But as time went on, I began to cherish these dreams, to look forward to them every night. They were a respite from the limitations of my physical body, a chance to feel whole again.

In my dreams, I would do all the things I couldn't do in real life. I would play guitar with two hands, throw a ball effortlessly, tie my own shoes, and even hold hands with someone without feeling self-conscious. It was like the world opened up to me when I had two hands, and I was free to explore it however I pleased.

But the dreams were bittersweet. When I woke up, I was always reminded of what I had lost, of the challenges that still lay ahead. It was hard to reconcile the freedom of my dreams with the reality of my everyday life. I would look down at my empty sleeve and feel a sense of loss, even though I knew I couldn't change the past.

One day, I decided to talk to a therapist about my dreams. I thought maybe if I could understand why I had them, I could make peace with my situation. The therapist listened patiently as I described my dreams, and then asked me a question I never expected.

"What would it be like," she asked, "to fully accept your reality, to embrace your life as it is, without constantly longing for something else?"

It was a difficult question to answer. I had spent so much of my life trying to compensate for my missing limb that I had never considered the possibility of simply accepting myself as I was. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that maybe that was the key to finding happiness.

After that session, I began to shift my perspective. I stopped dwelling on what I couldn't do and started focusing on what I could. I learned to ask for help when I needed it, to be patient with myself when things were difficult, and to appreciate the small victories along the way.

And while I still have my dreams of two hands, they no longer hold the same weight they once did. They are a reminder of what could have been, but also a tribute to what is. Because even with one hand, I am complete.
