The founding fathers come back from the dead to check up on America, and boy do they have some asses to kick.
The founding fathers were back, and they were not happy. They had been brought back from the dead, for a singular purpose- to check out what was happening with America, their creation. And what they saw… it was not pretty.

They saw homeless people on the streets, children being mistreated, healthcare being treated as a luxury, and the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. The founding fathers had spent too many hours and too much blood, sweat and tears to let it all go to waste. They did not come back for mourning, they came back for business.

George Washington was the first to speak up- “What in god’s name have you all done? Do you think I would have spent all those years of my life fighting for liberty and freedom if I had known that people were going to suffer like this?” The other founding fathers nodded in agreement.

Thomas Jefferson added, “If we had envisioned a future like this for America, we would have written a different constitution. There would have been protections in place for everyone, not just the elite.”

Benjamin Franklin, with a lightning bolt in his hand, asked the people in power, “What have you done with all the knowledge and progress we worked so hard to establish? Why are there still problems like racism and poverty? Why don't people have equal opportunity?” 

The founding fathers returned to their graves with a heavy heart, wondering if their vision for America would ever be achieved.
