about to be cloned, but before you are, the doctor says the clone will be tattooed to identify which one is the original. But after you wake up, you notice that *you* have the tattoo. What do you do/say/think?
I never thought the day would come when I would be cloned. But after a particularly nasty car accident, the doctors told me that my body had received severe damage and it wouldn't be able to sustain life for much longer. They came to me with the idea of cloning myself.

I was hesitant at first, but the thought of continuing on with my life, albeit in a different body, was too strong to ignore. So I agreed. The doctors told me that the clone would be created from my DNA and would be an exact replica of me. The only difference was that the clone would be tattooed to set it apart from the original.

The day of the procedure came and I was nervous. The doctors gave me anesthesia and I drifted off into a deep sleep. When I woke up, I felt disoriented and a bit confused. The first thing I noticed was the tattoos on my arms and legs. They were intricate designs, etched into my skin, and I didn't have any recollection of getting them.

I looked around the room and saw the doctors standing nearby, monitoring my vital signs. I called out to them and asked why I had the tattoos. They hesitated but eventually told me the truth. The clone had been created, but somehow during the procedure, the tattoos had been transferred to my body instead.

I was speechless. I didn't know what to say or how to react. Part of me was relieved that I wouldn't have to deal with the stigma of having a clone, but the other part of me was scared. What if the clone had some sort of deformity that they weren't telling me about? What if it had a serious medical condition?

I asked the doctors about the clone, but they told me that they had to keep it in a controlled environment for a few months before it would be fully functional. In the meantime, they would run tests on it to ensure that it was healthy and stable.

As the days passed, I started to settle into my new reality. The tattoos on my body were a constant reminder of what had happened, but I tried not to dwell on it. I focused on recovering from my injuries and starting fresh. I didn't want to think about the clone or the implications of having an exact replica of myself out there in the world.

But one day, I received a call from the doctor who had performed the procedure. He told me that the clone had been successfully created and was ready to be released into the world. He also said that they had implanted a tracking device on the clone, so they would always be able to locate it and monitor its movements.

I didn't know what to think. On one hand, I was curious about the clone and how it would turn out. But on the other hand, the thought of having a copy of myself out there, free and wandering, was unsettling. I asked the doctor what the plan was for the clone, and he told me that they hadn't decided yet. It would need to undergo some more tests and evaluations before they could determine its purpose.

As I sat there on the phone, listening to the doctor talk about the clone, I started to feel a strange sensation in my body. It was like something was shifting inside of me, all the way down to my bones. Suddenly, I felt a sharp pain in my chest and I doubled over, gasping for air.

The doctor's voice faded away as I fell into darkness. When I woke up, I was in a hospital bed, surrounded by doctors and nurses. They told me that I had suffered a severe heart attack and that I had been lucky to survive. They also told me that I would need to be closely monitored for the next few days to ensure that there were no further complications.

As I lay there, listening to the beeping of the machines and the hushed whispers of the medical staff, I couldn't help but think about the clone. Was it connected to my health in some way? Had the doctors created something they didn't fully understand? And most importantly, what would happen to me now that this clone existed?

I didn't have the answers to those questions, and I doubted that anyone would be able to provide them. All I knew was that I had a choice to make. I could either continue on with my life, try to forget about the clone and the tattoos, and hope that everything turned out okay. Or I could confront the doctors, demand more information, and try to reclaim some control over my life.

In the end, I decided to do the latter. I wasn't content with living in fear and uncertainty, wondering what would happen next. I wanted answers, and I was willing to do whatever it took to get them. So I got out of bed, put on my clothes, and headed for the door.

As I walked out of the hospital, I felt a sense of purpose wash over me. I was no longer just an accidental clone, a victim of science gone wrong. I was a person who deserved to know the truth about what had happened and what would happen next. And I would do everything in my power to make sure that I got those answers.
