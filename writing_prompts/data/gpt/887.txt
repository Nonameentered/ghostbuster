In the dimly lit alleyway, two hobos sat huddled together, finding warmth in a pile of haphazardly arranged cardboard boxes. One was clad in rags, with a scraggly beard that reached his chest, while the other was wrapped in a filthy blanket that reeked of cigarettes. 

"Hey there, friend," said the bearded man, his voice low and raspy. "What brings you here?"

The other man looked up, revealing piercing blue eyes that were both curious and guarded. "Just looking for a place to rest," he replied. "And you?"

The bearded man shrugged. "Same as you, I suppose. But tell me, have you ever met the Devil?"

The man's eyebrows shot up, but he said nothing.

"Oh, don't worry," the bearded man continued with a chuckle. "I'm not the devil. Just a humble hobo like yourself. But if you ever do meet him, tell him I said hello."

As the two men lapsed into a comfortable silence, little did they know that they were conversing with Jesus and the Devil, who had disguised themselves in human form to observe the world and its inhabitants. But for that brief moment, all that mattered was the warmth of each other's company and the words they exchanged.
