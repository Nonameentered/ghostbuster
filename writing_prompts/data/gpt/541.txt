Canada is under attack and has to call their last line of defence, if they can find them. They are: The Eh Team.
Canada always thought they were safe from such calamities. They were a peaceful country one with a low population density and friendly neighbors in America. But on a cold, windy night, they were under attack from an unknown force that seemed to spring out of nowhere. The Canadian forces were no match for them, and they were quickly overwhelmed. It was time to call the last line of defense.

The Eh Team is Canada's first and last line of defense. They are a group of experienced soldiers with unparalleled abilities who have proven themselves in previous battles. They are not like any other soldiers. They have unique skills and are the best in their respective fields. They are the ones who will bring back Canada from the brink of disaster.

The Eh Team was called in. They were fast to answer the call. Each one of them was a master in their fields, and together they made a force. They were given their orders and took off towards the Canadian border. The team was like a well-oiled machine. They were trained to work in sync with each other, to understand one another's strengths, and to overcome their weaknesses.

The team had to cover several hundred miles, but they arrived at the Canadian border in no time. When they did, they found the Canadian forces heavily damaged and in need of assistance. The team quickly got to work, bandaging wounds, and assessing their current situation. They knew they had to act fast.

A small group had found that the source of the attack was a group of extraterrestrial creatures. Each one of them was unique in its way and was capable of firing a highly powerful laser that decimated anything in its path. These creatures were the size of small bears and had sharp claws and teeth that could quickly rip through human skin and armor.

The team was given their orders and got to work in taking out the extraterrestrial creatures. They had to do it with speed and precision, as the creatures were fast and difficult to catch off guard. The Eh Team had to make a plan, and they did.

The team's leader, Captain Mercy, led them through the woods, following the creatures' path. The Eh Team's sniper, Sergeant Levi, took out the creature's guards while Captain Mercy and the team's powerhouse, Corporal Jack, guarded their sniper. The team's communications officer, Private Brook, stayed back, giving Captain Mercy the reconnaissance they needed.

The team worked in tandem. Each soldier played their part, and together they moved forward, taking out the creatures one by one. The Eh Team had managed to kill a decent number of them before they were caught off guard by a more giant creature that the others seemed to obey.

The team had not anticipated such a large creature, but they were quick on their feet, and Corporal Jack took to fighting it. Meanwhile, Sergeant Levi and Private Brook took out the creature's smaller companions. Captain Mercy focussed on attacking the creature's tail, and once successful, the creature became disoriented, and Corporal Jack took it down.

The team regrouped to assess the situation. Thanks to their quick thinking, they had taken out the source of the attack quickly and efficiently. They knew they had saved Canada from potential destruction.

The Eh Team had done it again; they were the saviors of Canada. The country was safe once again thanks to the team's hard work and dedication. They had lived up to their name and showed the world why they are the last line of defense.
