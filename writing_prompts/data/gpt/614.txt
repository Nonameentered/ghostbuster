In a world where clothes were never invented, you suddenly realize you are naked.
In a world where clothes were never invented, everyone walked around in their natural state - naked. For us, it was something we had grown up with - a part of our culture, our way of life.

But one day, as I was walking through the crowded marketplace, I looked down and suddenly realized - I was completely naked.

At first, I didn't know what to do. It was as though the world had stopped moving around me and I was the only one left standing. It was a strange feeling, vulnerable and exposed, but also strangely liberating.

I stood frozen for a moment, unsure of what to do, but eventually I managed to snap out of my shock and continued walking, trying to keep my head down and my body as covered as possible.

But it didn't take long for people to start noticing. At first, some snickered and pointed, but others were genuinely concerned and offered me clothing to cover myself up.

I could feel the eyes of everyone around me, all staring and judging me for my lack of clothes. It was like a heavy weight pressing down on me, suffocating me.

As I walked on, I noticed something strange around me. While everyone else was naked as they always were, their appearance had changed. I saw people wearing jeans, shirts, dresses, and even hats. Their nakedness was now concealed, and it hit me that I was the only one bare.

I realized that the clothes they had now 'miraculously' had were mine. They were not just wearing anything, they were in my attire, and as I looked around, I realized it could be anyone else's. Therefore, this was not just a prank, but something specific. I felt cheated, humiliated, and further exposed than ever before.

It became clear to me, that I had to find a solution to this problem as soon as possible. I couldn't be the only one. Something was not the way it used to be, and I had to know what caused it.

It was then that I decided to talk to the elders of my community. They had never seen anything like this before and admitted that it was a strange and unusual occurrence.

Days went by without any promising answer, and eventually, people started to get used to it and accept me for who I was, wearing no clothes at all.

In the end, I never did figure out who was behind the strange occurrence, but eventually, I learned to accept myself, naked as I was, and embrace the new freedom it brought.
