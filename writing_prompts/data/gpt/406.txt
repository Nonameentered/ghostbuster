You know you have 3 days to live. You film yourself reading a written monologue to be played at your funeral in front of your friends and family, confessing your deepest, darkest secret that you hid for your whole life; this is that monologue.
I knew that this day would come, and yet, it still seems surreal. Three days to live – that's all I have left. And as cliché as it may sound, it really puts everything into perspective. It makes you realize what truly matters in life – and that's the people you love.

So, here I am, filming this video that will play at my funeral. I want to take this opportunity to confess my deepest, darkest secret – the one that I've kept buried inside me for my whole life.

You see, growing up, I always felt like I didn't belong. Like I was different, somehow. I didn't feel like I fit in with my family or at school. And as I got older, those feelings only intensified.

It wasn't until I was in my twenties that I finally found a place where I felt like I belonged – the LGBTQ+ community. For the first time in my life, I felt like I was a part of something. I felt like I had people who understood me, who accepted me for who I was.

But there was a problem – I was already married. I had been with my husband for years, and we had built a life together. And yet, I couldn't ignore this part of myself any longer. I had to be true to who I was.

So, I came out to my husband. And it was the hardest thing I've ever done. I remember sitting across from him, feeling like my heart was about to explode out of my chest. I was terrified of what he would say. Terrified of what it would mean for our marriage.

But he surprised me. He told me that he loved me no matter what. That he wanted me to be happy. And so, we decided to stay together, even though I knew that I would always be hiding a part of myself.

And I did hide that part of myself. For years, I lived a double life. I was married to my husband, but I also had a secret girlfriend. It was exhausting – trying to keep everything hidden from everyone. But I thought it was worth it because I didn't want to lose my husband.

But then, one day, I woke up and realized that I couldn't keep living like this. I couldn't keep lying to myself or to the people I loved. And so, I made the decision to leave my husband, to be with the person I truly loved.

It was a difficult decision, and it wasn't easy to tell my family and friends. I knew that some of them wouldn't understand, that some of them would turn their backs on me. And that's exactly what happened.

Some of my family members disowned me. Some of my friends stopped talking to me. I lost so many people that I loved because of who I am. It was a painful experience, one that I wouldn't wish on anyone.

But here's the thing – even though it was painful, even though it was difficult, it was worth it. Because now, I get to be with the person I love. I get to be true to who I am. And that is something that no one can take away from me.

To my family and friends who are watching this right now, I want you to know that I am sorry if I hurt you. I am sorry if my actions caused you pain. But I also want you to know that I don't regret my decision. I don't regret being who I am. Because, in the end, all we have is ourselves. And if we can't be true to ourselves, then what's the point?

So, I hope that watching this video helps you understand who I truly am. I hope that it helps you see that even in the darkest moments, there is still hope. And I hope that you can find it in your hearts to forgive me.

I don't know what the future holds, but I do know one thing – I am proud of who I am. I am proud to be a part of the LGBTQ+ community. And I am proud to have loved and been loved.

Thank you for watching this, and thank you for being a part of my life.
