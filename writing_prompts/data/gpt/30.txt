Lila sat on the rooftop of her apartment building staring up at the night sky. She was surrounded by the flickering light of the stars. It was beautiful, but it was also dark. 

She couldn't help but feel that her life was like the night sky. Even with all the people around her, she always felt alone. Even with all the accomplishments she had achieved, she always felt unfulfilled. Even with all the love she had received, she always felt unloved. 

Lila was lost in her thoughts, and she didn't even realize that her best friend Jake had climbed up next to her. 

"What are you doing up here all alone?" Jake asked, breaking the silence. 

"I just needed to clear my head," Lila replied, not wanting to open up about her thoughts. 

Jake knew Lila well enough to sense that something was wrong. "You know, even with all the stars on the sky, the night will always remain dark," he said. 

"I know," Lila sighed. 

"But that doesn't mean you have to face the darkness alone," Jake continued. "I'm here for you, Lila. You don't have to carry anything on your own." 

Tears started to flow down Lila's cheeks. "Thank you, Jake. I just feel so lost sometimes." 

"I know you do, that's why I'm here," Jake said, putting his arm around her. "Together, we can face any darkness." 

Lila looked up at the stars, but this time, she no longer felt alone. She had her best friend with her, and that was enough to light up even the darkest of nights.
