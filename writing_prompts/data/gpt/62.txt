Luisa had always known that being a vampire in Italy wasn't going to be easy. For one, the locals were notoriously superstitious, and considering her lifestyle, Luisa couldn't afford to be careless. She had heard all the tales of garlic, sun, and holy water and was well aware that any false move could lead to disastrous consequences.

As a result, Luisa had hired a housekeeper who regularly sprayed garlic repellent in every corner of her home. Unfortunately, though, the spray had an overpowering smell that lingered for hours on end and, at times, made Luisa feel ill. She couldn't sit in her own living room without a scarf around her nose.

Her other concern was the sunlight. She had to make numerous adjustments to her schedule, rescheduling her appointments to evenings, using tinted windows, among other measures to avoid the sun's rays. On days when she had to go out, she wore a heck lot of sunscreen and a large hat to protect her as much as possible.

The holy water issue was a severe one for Luisa. She had to avoid it at all costs, which was challenging considering religious iconography was everywhere in Italy. At first, she tried to stay away from anything that looked remotely religious, but that wasn't sufficient. At a time, she fell ill for weeks after unknowingly walking into a church.

Luisa had faced these challenges since she could remember, and they only seemed to be getting harder. However, she found comfort in her luxurious Italian villa, the one place where she didn't have to worry about everything that could get her killed. The land on which the villa sat, owned by her family for ages, was free of any holy or religious artifacts, which was a big relief for Luisa.

She was sitting in her garden, enjoying the fresh breeze, when she heard a sudden noise. Her eyes widened as she saw two young girls, who seemed to have been playing, walk into her garden. 'Oh no!' Luisa thought, her heart racing at the thought of having to explain herself. She waited for the girls to see her but they kept running towards her. As they approached, Luisa quickly covered her face with her hat, hoping that they wouldn't catch a glimpse of her eyes - the only tell-tale sign of her true identity.

"Hello, who are you?" One of the girls asked, intrigued, as she gazed at Luisa's hat. It was then when Luisa finally looked up, surprised to see the girls unfazed by her appearance.

"I'm Luisa, who are you?" Luisa replied, nervous.

"I'm Maria, and this is my friend, Giulia." The girls said in unison.

"Hello, girls," Luisa smiled, relieved. At least they don't know, she thought. And that was the start of a beautiful friendship between Luisa, Maria, and Giulia.

As they spent more time together, Luisa slowly started letting her guard down around the girls. One sunny day, Luisa had accidentally forgotten to cover her face when she went to pick up the girls. Maria, who was astute for her age, had noticed that Luisa was not very sensitive to sunlight and was perplexed.

"Why aren't you afraid of the sun? Don't you get sick like the rest of us?" Maria asked, fascinated.

And just like that, Luisa had to come up with a convincing story about why she wasn't like the rest of them. She had told them she was sick, needing to avoid the sun as a result. The girls were empathetic, and in some way, Luisa felt like they had accepted her for who she was.

In the end, Luisa learned that overcoming her fears and vulnerabilities was possible, especially when she had friends she could count on. It was tough, but at least she had a chance to enjoy the sunny Italian weather once in a while.
