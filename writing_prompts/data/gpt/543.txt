A new medical technology has been developed, allowing emergency responders to predict the location of the next accident before they even occur. Ambulances are now able to typically arrive at the scene very soon or even before the accident occurs. You hear an ambulance siren approaching you.
As I walked down the street, headphones in and lost in thought, I heard the familiar sound of an ambulance siren approaching. But this time it was different. The siren was getting closer and closer, yet there was no visible accident or commotion ahead.

As it passed me by, I noticed a new emblem on the side of the ambulance - "Predictive Emergency Response", it read. Curious, I googled it once I reached my destination.

I discovered that a new medical technology had been developed, able to predict the location of the next accident before it even occurs. This had resulted in ambulances arriving at the scene quicker than ever before.

It was incredible to think that accidents could now be prevented before they happen, and that injuries could be treated even before they occur. A world without accidents seemed too good to be true, but with this new technology, perhaps it was possible.
