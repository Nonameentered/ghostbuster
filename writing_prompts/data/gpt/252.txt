Benjamin had always prided himself on his family. They were a close-knit group, and he couldn’t be happier to have them by his side as he lay on his death bed. It had been a long battle with cancer, and in his final moments, he was grateful for the support of his loved ones. 

But as the minutes ticked away, a strange feeling began to creep over Benjamin. His eyes flicked from one family member to another, lingering a moment longer on the faces of those closest to him. He couldn’t pinpoint what it was that was bothering him, but he knew that something was wrong. 

The room was quiet, save for the soft rustle of clothing as family members shifted in their seats. The scent of flowers and antiseptic hung heavy in the air. Benjamin’s breathing was shallow, and he could feel the weight of exhaustion pulling him under. He turned his gaze towards his wife, hoping that her presence would bring him comfort. 

And that’s when he saw it. A flicker of something in her expression that made him pause. A trace of guilt, perhaps? Or was he just imagining things? 

Benjamin pushed the thought aside and focused on his breathing. He was going to die soon, and he didn’t want to spend his remaining moments succumbing to paranoia. He latched onto the memory of his daughter’s laugh, the feel of his son’s hand in his own, and found comfort in those simple things. 

But as time passed, Benjamin grew increasingly convinced that something was amiss. His family members were whispering to each other in hushed tones, and he couldn’t shake the thought that their eyes were lingering on him a moment too long. 

He couldn’t ignore the feeling any longer. “Why are you all looking at me like that?” he asked, his voice barely audible. 

There was a moment of awkward silence before his son spoke up, his voice cracking with emotion. “We’re just worried about you, Dad. Are you in any pain? Is there anything we can do?”

Benjamin gave an unconvincing smile. “No, no pain. Just tired.” 

It was then that he noticed something else. The glass of water on his bedside table was half-empty. He had been drinking from it all day, but now the thought occurred to him that perhaps his water had been tampered with. 

He looked up at his family, and an icy weight settled in his stomach. The thought was absurd… but what if it wasn’t? What if his family members were responsible for his sudden decline in health? 

The world tilted as Benjamin tried to comprehend what was happening. His wife was bending over him, her eyes soft and concerned. His daughter was petting his hand lightly, a small, sad smile on her lips. His brother was staring at his shoes, his face a mask of guilt. 

And that’s when it clicked. Benjamin realized that he had been poisoned. He didn’t know who had done it or why, but the evidence was right in front of him. His family members had been acting strange, the water tasted of something bitter. 

He tried to gasp for air, but it was as if his lungs had stopped working. His vision swam, and he felt as if he was being pulled under. 

“I love you all,” he whispered, his voice little more than a croak. “But what have you done?” 

There was a jolt of shocked dismay from his family members. Benjamin’s wife was crying, his son was holding her tightly, and his daughter was staring at him with something like horror on her face. 

“Dad, no,” she said, her voice rising in panic. “We didn’t do anything. We would never hurt you.”

But Benjamin knew the truth. It was as if a fog had lifted from his mind, and he could see everything clearly for the first time. His family members had always been protective of him, hovering over him like worried mother hens. They had always been a little too involved in his life, asking too many questions, trying to control his decisions. 

He had thought it was just their way of showing love, but now he realized that it had been something darker all along. 

His heart was pounding inside his chest, and sweat broke out on his forehead. He felt as if he was in a nightmare from which there was no escape. 

His family members were looking at him with stricken faces, their eyes full of tears and fear. 

But it was too late for apologies, too late for explanations. Benjamin knew that the end was near. 

“I forgive you,” he whispered, his words barely audible. “But I cannot forget.”

And then he was gone, leaving his family members to deal with the aftermath of their actions.
