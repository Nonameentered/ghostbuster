You were born with the inate gift to know how someone you know will die. Unfortunately, you don't know when.
Ever since I could remember, I had noticed a strange ability to predict people's deaths. It wasn't something I could see, exactly. It was more of a feeling, a sense that lingered around certain individuals. At first, I thought it was purely coincidence. But as I grew older, it became impossible to ignore.

I had always known, for instance, that my grandfather would die in his sleep. It wasn't until years later, when my parents received the call from the hospital, that I realized that my sense had been right on the mark. And from there, I began to notice patterns - a lingering sense of unease around someone who would die of cancer, a feeling of weightlessness with those who would die in a car accident.

I was different from other people, and I knew it. But I had never truly appreciated just how strange my gift was until the day I met Amelia.

Amelia was a quiet girl, the kind of person who hovered on the fringes of social circles. She was overwhelmingly kind, always willing to lend a listening ear, but never quite managing to connect with anyone on a deeper level. I was intrigued by her - not because of some sense of morbid curiosity, but because she was different. Somehow, I knew that she was special.

It wasn't until months later, when Amelia's parents called to notify me of her passing, that I realized just how special she truly was. It had been sudden, an accident that no one could have predicted. But I knew, from the moment I received that call, that Amelia's life had been meant to end that way. She had been destined for a short, finite existence, and there was nothing anyone could have done to change it.

It was then that I truly grasped the full weight of my gift. Amelia's untimely death hit me like a freight train, and I couldn't help but wonder if there was any way that I could have saved her. If only I had known what was coming, maybe I could have intervened. But the truth was, I had no control over the timeline of people's lives. All I could do was wait, and hope that I could make a difference in the time that I had with them.

As the years went on, I watched my loved ones come and go. Some died young, taken before their time. Others passed away after long, fulfilling lives. But each death still hit me like a gut punch. There were moments when I wished that I could just turn off my gift, to live in blissful ignorance and never have to worry about the inevitable.

But then, in the midst of my grief, I would find the moments of light. The moments when I could help someone, when my gift allowed me to be there for them in a way that I never could have otherwise. Whether it was lending a comforting shoulder to a friend who had just lost a loved one, or just being able to cherish the time I had left with someone before their end, my gift had a purpose. And even if I couldn't change anyone's final fate, I could still make a difference in the time we had together.

In the end, that was all that mattered. My gift may have been strange, but it was a part of who I was. And with it, I could be there for the people I loved, in both the bright moments and the dark.
