The small village nestled in a valley where the waters run clear and cold. The stream was the lifeblood of the community, providing water for crops and animals. Jalal, the village leader, knew that the stream was in danger. Upstream logging threatened to turn the clear waters brown. Jalal knew he had to act quickly. He organized the villagers and marched upstream, speaking out against the logging operation. His passionate plea resonated with the loggers, who agreed to halt their work to protect the stream. Jalal's dedication to the waters saved the village and its way of life.
