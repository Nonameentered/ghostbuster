A man pulls a gun on a Denny's waitress after receiving his meal.
As soon as the man saw the charred meat patty on his burger, he knew that something was wrong. He waited until the waitress with a name tag that read "Jenny" approached him.

"Excuse me," he said cordially. "My burger looks a bit overcooked. Can I exchange it for a new one?"

"Sure thing," responded Jenny with a friendly smile. "I'm so sorry about that. I'll get it fixed for you right away."

But as soon as she walked away, the man's expression changed. His eyes darkened with rage, and his hand crept towards the bulge in his jacket pocket. A few moments later, Jenny returned with a new burger in hand, still steaming from the grill.

"Here you go, sir," she said, placing the plate in front of him. "I hope this one is better."

But the man didn't even bother to look at the new burger. Instead, he pulled out a gun and pointed it directly at Jenny's head.

"What the hell is this?" he growled through gritted teeth. "Are you trying to kill me?"

Jenny tried to keep her cool, but she couldn't help the tremble in her voice. "S-sir, please put the gun down," she stammered. "I don't know what you're talking about. We just made you a new burger."

The man's eyes bulged with fury. "You're lying to me," he spat. "I know what you did. You tried to poison me. Well guess what? I'm not going down that easy."

Jenny's heart pounded in her chest as she tried to find a way out of this nightmare. "Please, sir," she begged. "I swear we didn't do anything to your food. Can you just...just calm down and put the gun away?"

But the man was beyond reason. He began to rant and rave about corporate conspiracies and secret militias. Jenny could barely follow his incoherent rambling, but she knew one thing for sure: she needed to get out of there.

She slowly backed away from the table, trying to keep the man's attention on her. As soon as she was out of range, she bolted towards the kitchen, screaming for help.

Within moments, the man was tackled and disarmed by a team of off-duty cops who happened to be eating there that night. They arrested him for attempted assault and dragged him out of the restaurant in handcuffs.

Jenny collapsed in a heap on the floor, her whole body shaking with fear and relief. She knew she was lucky to be alive.

After that night, she had trouble sleeping and lost her appetite for weeks. But eventually, she went back to work at Denny's. She was determined not to let that crazy man ruin her life. But she knew that she would never forget the terror of that night - or the bravery of the people who came to her rescue.
