Humanity had always been an odd species, according to the rest of the galaxy. Their customs and technology were always out of the norm, and their solution to Faster-Than-Light (FTL) travel was no exception.

While most species relied on Kantian gates, Salec skip drives, Maltiun wave-riders, Delfanit pulse tubes, and other such methods, humanity chose a route thought to be unorthodox, unsafe, and damn stupid - they used wormholes.

Wormholes, according to all the known laws of physics, were a death sentence for any starship that entered one. The forces at play in a wormhole were beyond even the most advanced systems, and no known technology could withstand it for long enough to achieve an FTL jump.

Yet humanity found a way. They used their unconventional thinking to develop a new kind of tech, one that could get a ship through a wormhole and out the other side. All the other species in the galaxy thought it was impossible, and they laughed at the idea.

But humanity persisted. They built test ships and sent them through wormholes with no living crew members. To the surprise of the rest of the galaxy, the ships made it through to the other side.

The stars shone brighter than ever before as humanity's new technology was tested and improved. It was revolutionary, and the rest of the galaxy had to begrudgingly admit that it worked. But it was still deemed unorthodox, unsafe, and damn stupid.

Captain Jamie Li had been at the helm of one of the new wormhole ships for six months now, and they had made a discovery that was going to shake the galaxy to its core. They had found a planet rich in the rarest minerals - ones that could power entire cities for centuries.

Jamie had always been a rebel. Most of her life had been spent doing things her way, no matter how much trouble it got her into. So, when she presented the find to her superiors, she wasn't surprised when they called it unorthodox, unsafe, and damn stupid.

"They're just minerals, Captain," said her superior, Commander Adams. "We've got plenty of them. This isn't worth risking lives for."

"But, sir, these aren't just any minerals," Jamie replied. "If we can get them back to Earth, we'll have enough power to last us centuries. And we'll have the upper hand over the other species in the galaxy."

Adams looked at the reports and graphs on his desk. "It's risky, Captain. You know that."

"I know, sir," Jamie said. "But we're the only ones who can do this. We're the only ones foolish enough to try. We can do this. We can make a difference."

Adams sighed. "Alright, Captain. You have my permission to proceed with caution. But if anything goes wrong...I'm not gonna be the one explaining it to the Council."

Years of rigorous training had hardened Jamie's resolve, and she knew the risks involved. But she had always been one to defy the odds. It was a trait that had taken her this far.

She gathered her crew, and they went over the plans again and again. They simulated every possible outcome and reaction, and they went through every possible failure scenario. They knew they had to be prepared for everything.

As they soared through space towards the wormhole that would take them to the rich planet, Jamie felt a sense of excitement that she couldn't shake off. This was the moment they had all been waiting for - the culmination of years of work. The galaxy was watching, and they had everything to gain and everything to lose.

And then, they were there. They saw the gates of the wormhole open up before them, and they braced themselves for impact.

The ship shook and shuddered as the forces at play in the wormhole began wreaking havoc on their systems. Lights flickered, and alarms blared as Jamie and her crew tried to keep everything running smoothly.

But then, something went wrong. One of the systems that they had thought were failsafe had failed, and Jamie knew that they were in trouble.

If they continued on their current trajectory, they would be torn apart by the forces the wormhole exerted on anything that came through. If they tried to turn back, they'd be caught in the pull of the wormhole and be thrown back into the cosmos, lost forever.

Jamie had a decision to make, and it was one that could mean the difference between life and death.

She took a deep breath, pulled herself together and did the one thing that made her stand out as a captain - she took a leap of faith.

She powered up the engines and maneuvered the ship. They could feel the wormhole tugging at them, trying to rip them apart, but Jamie remained focused, knowing that the fate of her crew, and the whole of humanity, was in her hands.

As the ship blasted out the other side of the wormhole, Jamie breathed a sigh of relief. They had made it. They had succeeded where no other species in the galaxy could have.

And as they made their way down to the rich planet's surface, Jamie knew that this was the start of a new era for humanity. A new era that would be built on unorthodox, unsafe, and damn stupid ideas, but would reign above all in the galaxy.
