Tell me a story that comes from your real life in the past few days.
The past few days have been a blur of activity for me. With work, household chores and taking care of my toddler, I feel like I haven't had a moment to myself. However, amidst all this chaos, there was a moment that stood out for me.

It was a Saturday morning and I woke up groggy and tired. My toddler was already up and jumping on the bed, demanding my attention. As I dragged myself out of bed, I wondered how I would make it through the day. My husband was out for the day, so I was on my own.

After breakfast, I decided to take my toddler to the park. As we were walking, I noticed an elderly woman sitting on a bench, looking lost. She had a map in her hand and was muttering to herself. I debated whether to approach her and offer help, but hesitated. My toddler, however, had no such qualms and he ran over to her.

"Hi! I'm Ryan," he said, thrusting his tiny hand towards her.

The woman looked surprised but smiled back at him.

"I'm Mrs. Jones," she said. "Can you help me read this map?"

My heart swelled with pride as I watched my son help this stranger in need. He pointed out the directions and chatted with her, oblivious to the fact that she was a complete stranger.

As we walked away, I couldn't help but feel grateful and humbled by the experience. My toddler had shown me the power of kindness and the importance of taking a moment to help somebody.

Later that day, as I was putting my toddler to bed, he reminded me of Mrs. Jones.

"Mama, do you think she got to where she was going?" he asked.

"I hope so," I said.

"I hope we see her again," he said.

That night as I lay in bed, tired but fulfilled, I thought about the impact that small acts of kindness can have. It doesn't take much to offer help, to be kind, to show compassion. And yet, these small acts can have a ripple effect, touching the lives of people we don't even know.

The next day, my toddler and I went back to the park. We looked for Mrs. Jones but she wasn't there. As we walked back home, my toddler picked up a flower that had fallen from a tree and handed it to me.

"For you," he said. "Because you're kind."

I felt tears prick my eyes as I hugged him tight. In that moment, I knew that my life had been forever changed by the simple act of a stranger asking for directions, and a toddler offering his help. I had found purpose and meaning in a hectic week, and for that, I would forever be grateful.
