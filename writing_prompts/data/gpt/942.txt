Describe a well known story from the perspective of the antagonist. Try to conceal the actual story till the last line.
I was the most beautiful and powerful queen in all the land. Everyone who gazed upon my beauty and splendor would either bow down in admiration or tremble with fear. Yet, I was never truly happy, for I had a deep desire for a child of my own. 

One day, a young girl arrived at my doorstep with skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as ebony. She soon became my stepdaughter and was loved by all in the household except me. Her beauty and innocence made me feel inadequate and insignificant. 

I tried everything in my power to dim her light and prove to myself that I was still the fairest in all the land. But my jealousy grew into an obsession and I ordered my huntsman to take her into the woods and bring back her heart as proof of her demise. 

As her lifeless body lay before me, I triumphantly declared that I was the fairest in all the land. But my victory was short-lived as the huntsman revealed the truth and I was forced to flee into the woods, never to be seen again.

My name is Queen Ravenna, and this is the story of how I tried to destroy Snow White.
