As I stepped into the hospital room, I couldn't help but feel a sense of familiarity wash over me. I couldn't put my finger on why the room seemed so familiar, but as I walked around the bed, my heart started racing as I saw her lying there, motionless.

It was her, the girl from my dreams. The one who appeared in my dreams ever since I was a child, usually as a supporting character or someone who would show up for a brief moment before disappearing again.

I couldn't believe it. Usually, I wouldn't have thought much of it, but this time, it was different. I had seen her so many times in my sleep that it felt like I knew her. Seeing her lying there unconscious was almost as if I had lost someone close to me.

I pulled up a chair and sat down beside her, taking her hand in mine. I looked at her, trying to remember everything I could from my dreams. I wondered what she was doing here, why she was in a coma, and how long she had been like this. The machines that surrounded her beeped softly in the background, matching the rhythm of her breaths.

It was then that the nurse entered the room, a clipboard in hand. "Hi, I'm Annie," she said. "I'm here to check on our lovely Jane, and I see she has a visitor." She looked at me and smiled.

"How long has she been like this?" I asked, indicating Jane with a nod.

"Jane has been in a coma for about a year now," Annie replied. "She was in a severe car accident and hasn't woken up since."

A year. I couldn't believe it. How had I never heard about this? It was as if the world had gone on without me, and I was the only one left in the dark.

I stood up from my seat and started pacing, trying to process everything. Why did Jane keep appearing in my dreams? Was it just a coincidence, or was there something more profound going on?

Annie noticed my restlessness and placed a comforting hand on my arm. "Jane was a young and talented artist," she said softly. "She never got to show the world what she was capable of, but I would sometimes catch her drawing in her sleep. Maybe you knew her from somewhere."

I shook my head, wondering if I should tell her about my dreams. Would anyone believe me, or would they think I was crazy? I decided to keep it to myself and sat back down, taking Jane's hand once more.

As I sat there, lost in thought, I felt a tingling sensation in my fingers. I looked down and saw that Jane was starting to move. Her fingers twitched, and her eyes darted under her eyelids, as if she was trying to open them.

"Annie!" I called out, feeling a surge of hope. "Look, she's waking up!"

Annie rushed over and checked her pulse and vital signs, confirming that Jane was indeed coming around. "This is amazing!" she exclaimed. "She's been in a coma for so long; we'll need to run some tests to see what's going on."

As I watched the nurses and doctors work their magic around Jane, I couldn't help but feel like there was something more significant going on. Why had she been in a coma for so long, and why was she a recurring character in my dreams?

Days passed before Jane woke up fully, and when she did, it was as if a light had been turned on inside her. She smiled, hugged the nurses, and spoke to the doctors as if they were old friends. When she saw me sitting by her bed, her eyes lit up, and she took my hand in hers.

"I remember you," she said, her voice soft and gentle. "You were in my dreams, weren't you?"

I nodded, feeling a lump form in my throat. "Yes, I was. I couldn't believe it when I saw you here, I had to come and see you."

Jane squeezed my hand, her eyes brimming with tears. "You have no idea how much it means to see a friendly face," she said. "I'm so glad you're here."

Over the next few days, Jane and I talked and caught up on lost time. She told me about her life before the accident, how she had been working on her art and hoped to make a name for herself in the art world.

"I had a dream once," she said, "where I was painting a portrait of a person I'd never seen before. It was like their face was etched into my mind, but I couldn't remember where I had seen them before."

My heart skipped a beat. Was she talking about me?

"Did this person have curly brown hair and green eyes?" I asked, almost afraid to hear her answer.

Jane's eyes widened, and she nodded. "Yes, that's exactly who it was. How did you know?"

I told her about my recurring dreams about her and how she had appeared in them since I was a child. I showed her some of the sketches I had made of her in my journal, and she was amazed.

"I can't believe this," she said, tears streaming down her face. "It's like we were meant to meet, somehow."

It was as if the pieces of a puzzle were falling into place, and we were both starting to see the bigger picture. Our bond became stronger with each passing day, and it was as if our dreams had somehow brought us together.

After her recovery, Jane returned to her art, becoming even more talented than she was before the accident. She began painting portraits of me, and I felt like I finally had a place in the world.

When I looked at her paintings, I saw something more than just a portrait. I saw a reflection of our journey, of the dreams we had shared, and the memories we had created together.

As I looked at Jane, the girl from my dreams, I knew that I had found my place in the world, and it was right by her side.
