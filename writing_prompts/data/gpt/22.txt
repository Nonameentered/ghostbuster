Make me gag with a vivid description of an everyday object.
I picked up the spoon to stir my coffee. As I moved it around in the hot liquid, the silver metal reflected against the light. Suddenly, my stomach churned as I noticed the sticky residue on the handle. I tried to ignore it, but my nose caught a whiff of stale milk and rancid breath emanating from the tool. My mind's eye flashed with images of germs and bacteria multiplying on the surface of the spoon- their colonies spreading, mutating, and thriving. A shiver ran down my spine as I thought of the countless people who must have held it- their greasy fingers leaving a trail of grime behind. I felt bile rising up in my throat, and my hands involuntarily dropped the spoon back into the mug. I knew I couldn't drink anymore. The once mundane object was now a source of disgust.
