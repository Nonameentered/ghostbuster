It was a cloudy day when two men, Arthur and Edward, decided to go to the woods to end their lives. Both had different reasons for wanting to do so, but they shared the same sense of hopelessness and despair.

Arthur had recently lost his wife and children in a car accident. The grief and pain were too much for him to bear, and he had given up on life. Edward, on the other hand, had been diagnosed with a terminal illness and didn't want to suffer through the pain and agony of it all.

As they trekked through the dense forest, they heard each other's footsteps and finally met in a clearing. Both men stopped in their tracks when they saw each other, unsure of how to proceed.

"Hey," Arthur said, breaking the silence.

"Hey," Edward replied.

They both took a moment to look at each other and then slowly walked towards each other. Once they were only a few feet apart, they stopped and looked at the ground.

"This is not a place for two people," Arthur said.

"Yeah, I know. I was thinking the same thing," Edward replied.

They both looked up and their gazes met. Arthur could see the pain and the sorrow in Edward's eyes, and for a moment, he felt a glimmer of hope that he wasn't the only one struggling.

"Listen, I know what you're here for, and I gotta say, I don't think it's the right thing to do," Arthur said, trying to convince Edward to change his mind.

Edward looked at him, surprised.

"I don't think it's the right thing to do either," he said.

They both stood there, unsure of what to do next.

"What do we do then?" Arthur asked.

Edward shrugged, "I don't know. But I'm willing to listen if you want to talk."

Arthur took a deep breath, and then he told Edward everything about his life before the accident, the happy times he shared with his wife and kids, and the pain he felt after losing them. Edward listened intently, and when Arthur finished, he shared his story too.

They both talked for hours, sharing their life stories. They talked about their hopes and their dreams, their achievements, and their failures. They talked about all the things that had made them happy and all the things that had caused them pain.

As they talked, something strange happened. They started to feel a sense of connection and understanding with each other. They both knew what it felt like to lose something precious, and they both knew how bad it felt to be alone in this world.

And as the day started to fade away, they both realized that they didn't want to die anymore. They both wanted to live and make the most of their lives, however long or short they may be.

They hugged each other, and as they walked out of the woods, they knew that they had made a friend for life.

As they stood at the edge of the woods, looking out towards the horizon, they both felt a sense of peace and satisfaction. They had both been given a second chance, and they were determined to make the most of it.

"I'm glad we met, Arthur," Edward said, looking at his new friend.

"Me too, Edward," Arthur replied, smiling.

They both walked away, knowing that they had each other's back, no matter what.

And as they went their separate ways, they knew that they had made a pact to live their lives to the fullest, and never give up hope.
