I just learned what a drabble is, and I'm determined to write one. As someone who tends to ramble on and on, the idea of packing a complete story into only one hundred words seems daunting. But I'm up for the challenge.

I sit at my desk, fingertips hovering over the keyboard. My mind races with possibilities, each scenario barely forming before another takes its place.

Finally, I settle on a story-- one about a girl who learns a valuable lesson about kindness. Her journey is short but impactful, ending with a simple act of generosity.

As I reach the last word, I can't help but smile. It's not perfect, but it's mine-- a little piece of fiction that packs a big punch. And just like that, I'm hooked on drabbles.
