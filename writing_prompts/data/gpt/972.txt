A world where justly killing a murderer brings their victims back to life and full health.
In a world where murder was rampant and justice was scarce, a new law was put in place. If a murderer was killed justly, their victims would come back to life and be restored to full health. The law was met with mixed emotions, with some seeing it as a chance for redemption and others as an opportunity for revenge.

One day, a man named John was walking home from work when he stumbled upon a mugging. Without hesitation, he intervened and managed to subdue the attacker. As the police arrived, they recognized the attacker as a notorious murderer who had been evading capture for months.

John's act of bravery was met with praise and admiration, but it wasn't until weeks later that he truly saw the impact of his actions. The victims of the murderer's previous crimes were brought back to life, their wounds fully healed. They thanked John for his heroic act, knowing that without him, justice may never have been served.

From then on, John became an advocate for the new law, spreading the importance of taking action against those who threaten the safety and lives of others. He knew that in doing so, he was not only fighting for the present but also for the past, giving the victims of past crimes a second chance at life.
