The Black Death didn't just kill people, it allowed them to reanimate (Medieval Zombies i guess)
In the year of our lord 1348, a terrible plague swept across Europe. It was called the Black Death, and it killed millions of people. But that wasn't the worst of it. Those who died from the disease were not simply laid to rest, as their bodies rose again, transformed into horrific creatures â€“ undead abominations, with a hunger for human flesh and an unrelenting desire to spread the disease.

Quickly it was discovered the only way to end their cursed existence was with a blade to the head. Villages were put to the torch, to ensure that the horror would not spread further.

The Kingdoms of Europe struggled to survive this new threat. At times the undead hordes threatened to overwhelm entire cities, leaving the living little more than scavengers picking over the bones of a once-great civilization.

As the plague raged on, the remaining populations became more and more desperate, seeking shelter wherever they could. Church fortresses and castles provided sanctuary for those fortunate enough to find refuge.

But even in the darkest times, there were those brave and strong enough to fight back. Bands of warriors, known as Black Knights, roamed the land, ever-vigilant in their quest to exterminate the hoards of the undead and thus bring hope and the end of the age of this plague.
