I had always heard about the idea of quantum immortality, but I never thought it could be true. That is until I experienced it myself. It turns out that every time I die, my consciousness just switches to another universe where I'm still alive. I've died countless times now - in car crashes, plane crashes, even from old age. But every time I die, I just wake up in another world. 

At first, it was exhilarating. I felt invincible, like nothing could touch me. But here's the catch - I'm the only one who knows. Everyone else sees me as just one person, living one life. I've watched as my friends, family, and loved ones have died, and I'm still here. It's a lonely existence, to say the least. 

I've tried to tell people, to explain what's happening to me. But no one believes me. So now, I just live each day like it's my last. Because who knows? In some universe, it might be.
