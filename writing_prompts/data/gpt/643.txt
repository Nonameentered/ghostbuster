When you die, you see a screen reading 'New Game+' and 'Exit to Reality' Which do you chose and what happens next?
As I lay on my deathbed, I couldn't help but feel a sense of peace wash over me. I had lived a long and fulfilling life, and I was content with the way things had turned out. But as I took my final breath, something strange happened. My vision blurred, and I felt myself being pulled away from my body. Suddenly, I was standing in front of a giant screen, and I could hear a robotic voice speaking to me.

"Welcome to the afterlife. Please select your next step. Press 'New Game+' for another round, or 'Exit to Reality' to go back to the mortal realm."

I was taken aback by this sudden development. I had never heard of anything like this before. Was this really the afterlife? Was I being given a choice between starting a new life or moving on to whatever comes after death?

I looked at the two options on the screen, considering my choices. New Game+ sounded tempting. It was a chance to start over, to do things differently this time around. But what if I ended up making the same mistakes all over again? What if this next life was worse than the one I had just left behind?

On the other hand, Exit to Reality seemed like the safer option. I could return to the mortal realm, to the people and places I had loved and known all my life. But what if things had changed in my absence? What if no one remembered me, and I was left alone in a world that had moved on without me?

My mind raced with all the possible outcomes, each one more daunting than the last. But then, a thought occurred to me. What if I didn't have to choose?

"Can I choose both?" I asked the robotic voice.

There was a pause before the voice answered. "I'm sorry, but you must select one option."

Disappointed, I weighed my options once more. New Game+ or Exit to Reality. Life or death. It all came down to this one choice. And then, I made my decision.

"I choose New Game+," I said, taking a deep breath.

The screen flickered before me, and suddenly I felt a jolt go through my body. I was falling, falling, falling through a sea of stars and galaxies. It was exhilarating and terrifying all at once, and I couldn't help but wonder what kind of world I was about to enter.

Finally, I landed with a thud in a forest clearing. Around me, tall trees stretched up towards the sky, and I could hear the sounds of wildlife all around me. I took a deep breath, feeling the rush of excitement and adventure that came with a new life. This was my chance to do things differently, to make a real difference in the world.

As I stood up, I noticed a small figure approaching me. It was a creature unlike anything I had ever seen before. It had a humanoid body with long, slender limbs and large, glowing eyes. Its skin was a deep shade of purple, and it had a strange, almost ethereal quality to it.

"Greetings, traveler," it said in a soft, melodic voice. "I am Nara, a spirit guide. I will be your companion on this new journey."

I was taken aback by this unexpected meeting, but I quickly regained my composure. "Thank you, Nara. I'm looking forward to exploring this new world with you."

And with that, we set off into the forest, our feet crunching on the leaves and twigs beneath us. As we walked, Nara told me about this new world, about the different realms and creatures that existed here. It was all so different from the world I had left behind, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder and excitement.

And so began my new life. There were struggles and challenges along the way, of course, but I faced them head-on with the knowledge that I had been given a second chance. I traveled across vast landscapes, met incredible new friends, and fought against the forces of evil that threatened to destroy this world.

But even as I immersed myself in this new life, a part of me couldn't help but wonder what was happening back in the mortal realm. I wondered if my loved ones were okay, if they missed me as much as I missed them. I wondered if they were still living their lives, or if they too had passed on.

And so, after many years of adventure and exploration, I made the difficult decision to use my one remaining life to return to the mortal realm. I had accomplished so much in this new world, and I knew that whatever came next, I would face it with a newfound appreciation for life.

With a heavy heart, I chose Exit to Reality. The screen flickered once more, and suddenly, I was standing back in the hospital room where I had passed away. But things were different now. It was several years later, and the room had been cleared out. There were no machines, no tubes, and no one around to greet me.

I wandered out into the hallway, still trying to make sense of what had happened. As I walked, I noticed that everything looked different. The colors were more vibrant, the textures more detailed. It was like seeing the world in high definition for the first time in my life.

And then I saw her. My wife, who had passed away several years before me, was waiting for me at the end of the hallway. She was smiling, and I could tell from her eyes that she was happy to see me.

We hugged, and for a moment, I forgot about everything else. It didn't matter that I had left behind a whole world of adventure and mystery, or that I was no longer of this world. All that mattered was that I was with her again, and that we were together.

And as we walked off into the unknown, hand in hand, I knew that I had made the right choice. Whether in life or in death, there were always new beginnings waiting for us, new worlds to explore, and new friends to meet. And I was ready for whatever came next.
