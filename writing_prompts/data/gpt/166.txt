A world where each person needs to laugh at least once a day. Death awaits at midnight if they have n't.
In the world of Nicaea, laughter had become a sacred practice. The people of Nicaea had long known that laughter was the key to their happiness and well-being. And so, they had made it a law that everyone must laugh at least once a day. Failure to do so would result in a grim consequence - death.

The citizens of Nicaea had learned that laughter was indeed the best medicine. It aided in reducing stress, lowering blood pressure, and boosting the immune system. It also connected people with each other, and enhanced their sense of community. The importance of laughter had been instilled in them since birth, and it was a lesson that they took very seriously.

The streets of Nicaea reverberated with the sound of laughter. The people would laugh at every possible opportunity. Their days were filled with jokes, pranks, and humorous stories. The city had comedians, clowns, and jesters who entertained the locals with their amusing shows. Even the animals seemed to be in on the joke, giggling and making funny noises.

The law requiring laughter had been in place for centuries, and the people had grown quite accustomed to it. They laughed not because they were forced to, but because they genuinely enjoyed it. But one day, a strange occurrence took place.

Peter, a prominent businessman in the city, woke up one day feeling sad and down. He couldn't shake off the feeling, and try as he might, he couldn't make himself laugh. He tried watching funny videos, reading humorous books, and even visited the city's best clown, but nothing worked. He had failed to laugh that day.

As midnight approached, Peter grew increasingly anxious. He knew the consequences of not laughing, and the thought of facing death terrified him. He tried to force himself to laugh, but the harder he tried, the more miserable he became. Finally, when the clock struck midnight, Peter closed his eyes and waited for the inevitable.

But something strange happened. He didn't die. He opened his eyes and saw that he was still alive. He was relieved but confused. Why had he not died?

Peter decided to find out what had happened. He went to the city authorities, hoping to get some answers. The officials listened to his story and were equally perplexed.

They decided to conduct some experiments to determine the cause of Peter's reprieve. They discovered that Peter was not the only one who had failed to laugh and survived. They found that some people had a natural immunity to the death that awaited them. These people had a rare genetic mutation that prevented the deadly consequences of non-laughter.

The news spread like wildfire, and soon people were divided into two groups - those who could not help but laugh, and those who did not possess the genetic mutation and had to force themselves to laugh.

The authorities decided to revoke the law requiring laughter, and replaced it with a new law, “A smile must grace your face at least once a day.” The people of Nicaea realized that forcing people to laugh was not the solution. It was important to create an environment where people could naturally find joy and happiness.

This lesson was a valuable one, and the people of Nicaea learned it well. They began to focus on the things that truly mattered, like love, compassion, and understanding. They still laughed every day, but it was in a more natural and organic way, stemming from their own joy and happiness rather than any forceful legislation.

The new law was a testament to the people of Nicaea's resilience and adaptability. They had learned an important lesson, that happiness couldn't be forced, but rather must come from within. And so, the people of Nicaea went about their days, with smiles on their faces and laughter in their hearts.
