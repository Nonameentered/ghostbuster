Tell a story of an autistic teenager attempting to make friends with others.
Joey’s parents had known there was something different about their son from a very young age. He insisted on routine to the point of hysteria if anything was changed. They had invited experts to the house to assess him, but each had come with a different opinion. It wasn’t until he was eight that he was finally diagnosed with autism. 

The diagnosis brought peace of mind to his parents, who had been struggling to understand their son for so long. They found a specialist school for him and he had excelled in that environment.

As Joey entered his teenage years, he began to become more self-aware. He realized that the way he was reacting to situations wasn’t the same as his peers. He would have meltdowns in public places and other children would point and stare. He wanted to make friends but he didn’t know how. Joey’s parents were encouraging him to get out there and find common interests with his peers, but it wasn’t that simple. 

One of the interests Joey had was photography. He loved the way he could capture a moment in time. He would often go out into the garden and take photos of the plants and animals he found there. Joey’s mother came up with an idea to help him connect with other teenagers his age. She suggested he join a photography club which would give him the opportunity to make friends with people he had something in common with. 

The photography club was held in the local community centre on Wednesday evenings. Joey was nervous on his first evening. He didn’t know anyone there and he wasn’t sure what to expect. He brought his camera with him, and the sight of other teenage boys and girls with their own photography kits helped to calm his nerves. Lisa, the group leader welcomed him with a warm smile. She could tell from the way he held himself that he was uncomfortable.

“Hi Joey, it’s great to see you here. I heard you were a very accomplished photographer,” said Lisa cheerfully.

Joey was surprised that someone had heard of him before. It wasn’t often that he received compliments, but it felt right to be acknowledged for his skills.

The other members of the group were taking photos of each other as they set up their cameras. Joey watched as they all laughed and joked with each other. He didn’t know how to join in. Feeling intimidated, he took his camera and started to take photos of the plants outside the window. 

After a few minutes, Lisa approached him. “You look like you have a good eye for the outdoors, how about you show me some of your pictures?” she said encouragingly.

Joey looked up, surprised that she knew what he was photographing. He hesitantly passed her his camera and watched as she looked through it. 

“These are really beautiful,” said Lisa with a smile. “Would you mind if I showed them to the group?”

Joey felt a sense of pride that someone liked his photos. He nodded his head and watched as Lisa showed the other members his work. They were impressed and soon began asking him about the shots he had taken.

As the evening went on, Joey began to relax. He talked with the other members about his camera and the different shots he had taken. He discovered that they shared a common interest and this gave him confidence. For the first time, he felt like he belonged somewhere.

Over the following weeks, Joey looked forward to Wednesday evenings. He found himself joining in with the conversations and taking part in the planned activities. He started to open up about his autism and how it affected him. It was the first time he had spoken to anyone about it, and he felt relieved to have shared his struggles with people who could relate.

One evening, the club was planning a photo walk around the town. Joey had never been out on his own before, but with the group by his side, he felt safe. They were all taking photos of the landmarks and Joey was enjoying himself. 

However, when they arrived at a busy street, Joey’s anxiety started to rise. The noise from the cars and the crowds overwhelmed him. He didn’t know where to look or what to focus on. He felt his heart rate increase, and his palms started to sweat. 

Lisa noticed that Joey was distressed and guided him to a quieter area of the street. She spoke to him in a calm voice and asked him how she could help. Joey realized that he needed to leave the surroundings and decided he would walk back to the community centre and wait there for the others. Lisa accompanied him and they walked back in silence. Joey was grateful for her understanding and felt lucky to have such a supportive group of people.

As weeks turned into months, Joey was gaining confidence in his abilities. He was learning how to communicate with people and was developing social skills. He continued to attend the photography club and make new friends.

The photography club had been a turning point for Joey. It had given him a platform to engage with others who shared his passion and it allowed him to start a journey towards making connections in a world where he had always felt alone. It was much more than just a club, it was a place he could be himself, and that was everything he had been searching for.
