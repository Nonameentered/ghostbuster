A magic coin gives the owner just enough money to get by, until they can finally support themselves, then they must give it to another person in need.
Once upon a time, there was a young man named Jack who lived in a small village. He wanted to move to the city to pursue his dreams, but he couldn't afford the expenses. One day, he stumbled upon a magic coin that changed his life forever.

The coin was unlike any he had ever seen. When he held it, he felt a warm glow and a voice whispered, "This coin will provide you with just enough money to get by, until you can support yourself. Then, pass it on to someone in need."

Jack was skeptical, but he decided to give it a try. The next day, he woke up to find a shiny new quarter under his pillow. He used the money to buy food and pay for his rent. He thought it was just a coincidence, but every day, he woke up with a new coin, just enough to get by.

After a few weeks, Jack realized that he was getting closer to achieving his dream of moving to the city. He had saved enough money to buy a bus ticket and rent a small apartment. But he remembered the magic coin's instructions and knew it was time to pass it on to someone else.

Jack decided to give the coin to a homeless man he often saw on the street. He explained to the man how the coin worked and gave it to him. At first, the man was hesitant, but Jack convinced him that the coin was real and that it had helped him get to where he was.

The next day, Jack left for the city feeling grateful for the coin's help. He knew that he had achieved his dream because of it. He promised himself that he would come back to the village one day and help others in need, just like the magic coin had helped him.
