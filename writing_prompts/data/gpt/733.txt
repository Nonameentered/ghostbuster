John was excited to receive a jury duty letter. It was an opportunity to serve justice, to be a part of the system that he had manipulated countless times in his career as a serial killer. He arrived at the courthouse, his stomach churning with anticipation. As he sat in the jury box, he watched the accused, a young man he had never seen before, enter the room.

The trial was for a string of murders that took place over the past year. John felt a rush of satisfaction as the prosecution presented their case. He recognized his own handiwork in the descriptions of the killings. But as the trial went on, John began to see inconsistencies. The evidence was weak, the witness testimonies were shaky, and the accused's alibi was air-tight.

John knew the young man was innocent. He had never seen him before and he certainly had nothing to do with the murders. John's ego started to grow, he couldn't believe he had been caught: "This guy is a patsy!" John thought. 

The verdict came back guilty, and John was outraged. He knew that they had gotten the wrong person. He snuck one piece of paper into the pile of guilty verdicts they were giving the judge, sneering as he did it, thinking he could outsmart the authorities one more time.

A few days later, John received a letter from the district attorney's office. They had evidence that exonerated the man who had been wrongly accused during his trial. As John read the letter, he felt a twinge of regret for the first time in his career. He thought about all the innocent lives he had taken, all the families he had destroyed. He realized now that he had chosen his path, and he alone was responsible for the lives lost. John walked into the police station and turned himself in for the murders, a small gesture of redemption for his dark past.
