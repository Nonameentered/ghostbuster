Jessie gazed at the woman in front of her, her expression a mixture of confusion and awe. "What do you mean you don't have a heart?" she asked, eyeing the hatch on the woman's chest.

The woman smiled wistfully. "I mean exactly that. My body runs on mechanical systems, not organic ones. But," she added, tucking her hand into the hatch, "if I did have a heart, it would belong to you."

She pulled her hand out, revealing a small metal heart in her palm. Jessie gasped, reaching out to take it. "What is this?" she asked, turning it over in her hand.

"It's a symbol," the woman replied. "A symbol of my devotion to you. I may not have a heart, but I have the capacity to love - and you're the one I choose to love."

Jessie's heart melted, and she leaned in for a kiss. She may not understand the woman's unusual condition, but she knew one thing for sure - she had found someone truly special.
