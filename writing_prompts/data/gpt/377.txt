You time travel back to the feudal Japan and discover that 1980's media mostly depicted the ninja accurately.
As I stepped out of the time machine, I was greeted by the sights and smells of feudal Japan. The bustling market, the sound of clashing swords, and the scent of incense filled the air. I had always been fascinated by this time period, and I was excited to explore it firsthand.

As I began to wander, I noticed that many of the people were dressed like the ninjas of my childhood imagination. I was surprised to find that many of the depictions I had seen in 1980s media were accurate. They wore black suits, carried swords and throwing stars, and were skilled in martial arts.

I was impressed with how skilled and stealthy the ninjas were, and I could see why they were feared by their enemies. They moved silently through the shadows, and their movements were fluid and precise. The ninjas' stoic demeanor was a stark contrast to the loud and flashy action heroes of modern movies.

As I explored more of feudal Japan, I found that the ninjas were not just legends from the past, but real fighters who played a vital role in Japan's history. I was grateful for the opportunity to travel back in time and witness their incredible skills firsthand.
