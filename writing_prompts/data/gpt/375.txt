When the news broke that everyone in the world could choose a superpower, it spread like wildfire. People of all ages, backgrounds, and nationalities began to covet their own superpower. Some wanted to fly, others to teleport, and still others to become invisible. The possibilities were endless, but the catch was inevitable: the more people who selected a certain power, the weaker it became.

As days turned into weeks, people began to make their choices. The first few days saw a variety of options: some people chose the ability to breathe underwater, while others chose to become incredible chefs. But soon, it became apparent that certain powers were becoming more popular than others. The ability to fly quickly lost its luster, as thousands of people across the globe took to the skies. The power of strength was similarly weakened, as more and more people became invincible.

As the weaker powers became crowded, people began to consider more obscure options. One man in Japan chose to become a human calculator, able to solve any equation in seconds. A woman in Brazil chose to become invisible to insects, hoping to avoid pesky mosquito bites. In the United States, a young boy chose to become a human compass, always able to point north.

Despite the limitations, people continued to make their choices. Some chose based on practicality, others on whimsy, and still others on revenge. But as time went on, it became clear that certain powers had truly become weaker. People who could once soar through the air with ease now found themselves winded after just a few minutes. Those who could once lift cars with ease now struggled to open a jar of pickles.

Despite the limitations, people continued to find joy in their superpowers. Some used them for altruistic purposes, while others used them for personal gain. But as time went on, it became clear that the true power was not in the abilities themselves, but in how they were used.

In the end, it turned out that the most valuable superpower of all was not something that could be chosen. It was compassion, an ability that only grew stronger as more people began to cultivate it within themselves.
