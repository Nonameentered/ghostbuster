For as long as anyone could remember, the portals had been opening up across the surface of the world. The demons would pour through, wreaking havoc before retreating back into the abyss from which they came. But nothing had ever been quite like the largest portal, which had just opened up in the middle of New York City.

The city was torn apart from the inside out as a massive, scaly demon clawed its way through to our world. Buildings crumbled as if they were made of cards, and fires burned out of control. The citizens of New York—once bustling, now dazed and confused—fled in every direction, but there was no escape.

At the heart of the destruction was a small child, standing alone in the middle of what had once been Times Square. She was the only one left in the city, at least as far as anyone knew.

The demons seemed to treat her differently, too—not attacking her, but instead watching her with intense interest. They hovered around her like vultures, each one seemingly waiting for its turn to pounce.

The child knew what needed to be done. She had always known. Without any hesitation, she stepped forward and raised her hands. The demons howled as the energy from her palms flooded into the portal, slowly pushing it back from whence it came.

As the portal sealed closed, a new world was born. One where the demons could not tread and the child stood at its center. For the rest of humanity, it would be a time of great rebuilding, but for the small child in the ashes of New York, it was just another day of saving the world.
