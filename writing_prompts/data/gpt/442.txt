Sunday Free Write: Scarry Edition
Once upon a time, there lived a little girl named Samantha. She loved spending her Sundays curled up on her favorite armchair with a good book and a cup of hot chocolate. But today was different. Today was the Scary Sunday.

Samantha had heard stories from her friend Sarah about a dark forest at the end of their street. Sarah claimed that the forest was home to scary creatures and ghostly figures. Samantha had always shrugged off the stories, knowing that Sarah had a wild imagination. But this Sunday, Samantha was feeling adventurous.

She decided to take a walk to the end of the street to see the forest for herself. She put on her warmest coat, tied her scarf tightly around her neck, and set off on her journey.

As she reached the end of the street, Samantha saw the looming forest in front of her. She took a deep breath, gathered all her courage, and entered the forest.

The first few steps were easy, but as she walked deeper into the forest, Samantha's heart began to beat faster. The trees seemed to close in on her, and the darkness was all-consuming.

As she walked, something caught her eye. She saw a pair of glowing red eyes staring at her from behind a tree. Samantha froze in fear, but she didn't dare make a sound. She waited for a few seconds, but the eyes didn't move. She finally mustered the courage to move forward.

The forest seemed alive with rustling leaves and twigs snapping beneath her feet. The silence was broken now and then by an eerie hooting sound that seemed to come from a distance. Samantha's heart raced as she thought of what could be making the sound.

Suddenly, she spotted a small clearing in front of her. There was a thick mist that covered the ground, and a faint light shone through the mist. Samantha's curiosity got the better of her, and she walked towards the light.

As she got closer, she saw that the light was coming from a small fire burning in a circle of stones. There was an old woman sitting by the fire, stirring a pot of bubbling liquid. The woman looked up as Samantha approached, and her eyes widened with surprise.

"What are you doing here, child?" The old woman asked in a raspy voice.

Samantha told the woman about her adventure into the forest, and the old woman nodded her head slowly. "I see, you're a brave one, aren't you? But you're in grave danger here."

"Why?" Samantha asked.

"The forest is home to many dark creatures. They're not friendly to humans. The only way to get out of the forest is to find the key that's hidden somewhere in it," the old woman said.

Samantha was confused. "What key?"

"The key that will open the door that leads out of the forest. You must find it before the creatures find you," the old woman said, looking worried.

Samantha didn't waste a moment. She thanked the old woman and started walking again. She had to find the key.

She walked deeper into the forest and searched high and low for the key. The darkness was overwhelming, and she was beginning to feel hopeless. That's when she heard a faint song coming from the distance.

She followed the sound and came across a tree that was glowing with a soft light. Under the tree sat a beautiful bird with feathers of gold. It was singing a sweet melody, and Samantha felt drawn to it.

As she approached the bird, it stopped singing and looked at her. Samantha asked the bird about the key. The bird chirped and flew up into the air. It circled around Samantha, and then flew off into the darkness.

Samantha followed the bird and found herself in front of a large tree. There was a small hole in the trunk of the tree, and the bird was perched on a branch next to it. Samantha looked into the hole and saw something glinting in the darkness. She reached in and pulled out a small key. 

She knew what she had to do. She ran back to the old woman's clearing. She found the hidden door and used the key to unlock it. A bright light shone out. Samantha took a deep breath, gathered all of her courage, and stepped through the door.

She found herself back at the end of her street. She was relieved and grateful to be home, but she knew that she would always remember her adventure into the dark forest. She knew that sometimes being brave is the only way to overcome your fears.
