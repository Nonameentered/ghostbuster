As I lay in bed after enduring the worst day of my life, I contemplated my three options. Option one was to continue on, facing the consequences and emotions that came with the events of the day. Option two was to restart the day, hoping to make different choices that would lead to a better outcome. Option three was to restart my entire life, starting fresh and erasing all the mistakes and heartaches.

I couldn't bear the thought of continuing on with the weight of the day's events on my shoulders. The idea of reliving the same day and hoping for a different outcome seemed futile. That left me with the daunting decision of whether or not to restart my entire life.

As I thought about all the memories and experiences that would be lost, my heart ached. However, the thought of having a clean slate and the opportunity to make better choices and avoid the mistakes of my past was too tempting to resist.

I made my decision and chose to restart my life. As I closed my eyes, everything around me faded away. I opened my eyes to a completely blank canvas. The possibilities and opportunities were endless, but this time I was determined to make the most of them and create a life worth living.
