As I stepped out of the teleportation unit, I couldn't help but shudder at the thought of my body being destroyed and recreated every time I used it. It was unsettling knowing that each time I teleported, a copy of myself was left behind, left to carry on without me.

But little did I know, Heaven and Hell were struggling to cope with the billions of duplicated souls created every year. It had become a major issue that needed to be addressed urgently, so a bipartisan emergency meeting was called to sort out the problem.

The meeting was held at a neutral location in between Heaven and Hell. Top officials from both sides were present, and even I was surprised to see that they were sitting together, putting their differences aside for the greater good.

The meeting began with a solemn silence as both sides contemplated the gravity of the situation. The number of duplicated souls had reached alarming levels, and it was apparent that not much time was left before the situation went out of hand.

"The situation is dire, and we need to come together to find a solution as soon as possible," said Gabriel, addressing the group. "We cannot let this go on. It is causing havoc not only in Heaven and Hell but also on Earth."

The mood in the room was grim as the officials acknowledged the existence of a growing number of cases where the duplicated souls had caused chaos on Earth. If this were not resolved, it could lead to an apocalypse.

"Can we not find a way to preserve the original soul without having to destroy and recreate it every time?" asked Lucifer, speaking up from his seat.

There was a murmur of agreement from both sides, and the discussions continued late into the night. It took several hours of brainstorming, proposals, and debates before they finally reached a breakthrough.

They devised a unique system that would eliminate the need for duplication of souls each time someone teleported. The system involved capturing the soul's composition and transmitting it to the destination where it could be reconstructed without destroying the original.

It was a revolutionary system that could potentially save billions, if not trillions, of souls. Heaven and Hell officials worked together to install the new teleportation system on Earth, and the world quickly embraced it.

Within months, the number of duplicated souls dropped dramatically. There was an immense sense of relief in Heaven and Hell as the threat of an apocalypse faded away.

But for me, the most amazing thing was the fact that the warring factions of Heaven and Hell could come together to work towards a common goal. It was a beautiful example of how even in the darkest of times, humanity could come together to save itself.

The new teleportation system revolutionized the way we traveled. Gone was the anxiety and fear that came with each teleportation, and in its place was a sense of excitement and adventure. We were no longer living in fear of an apocalypse but had instead, found unity to overcome its threat.

As I stepped out of the teleportation unit, I smiled at the irony of it all. Something that had once been so terrifying was now one of the most wonderful things in the world. It had brought us all together.

Who would've known that all it would take was an emergency meeting to bring Heaven and Hell together to solve one of the most significant problems of our time. Together, they had created something extraordinary, and today, humanity stood united in the face of a new future.
