Write a poem entitled 'A secret worth telling' using no more than 20 sentences.
Once upon a time, there was a secret worth telling
Something so precious, it felt like a swelling
It was a secret that needed to be shared
But it was one that nobody dared

She kept it locked away in her heart
Afraid of what would happen if she did impart
But it gnawed at her every single day
A secret that wouldn't go away

Until one day, she couldn't take it anymore
She had to let it out, of that she was sure
She took a deep breath, and let it all spill
The secret that she'd been afraid to reveal

And to her surprise, the world didn't end
Instead, a new chapter was about to begin
For the secret that she'd been so damning
Was actually something quite stunning

She had written a book, but kept it hidden away
Afraid of what others might say
But as soon as it was out in the open
It became a bestseller, above and beyond

Everyone was touched by her story
It brought them love, joy, and glory
A secret worth telling, indeed
And it was one that she would never again withhold, but freed.
