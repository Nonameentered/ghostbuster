What was the most terrifying experience you had? Write about it!
As a young child, I lived in a small beach town with my family. One day, while playing outside, a man approached me and offered me some candy. As an innocent child, I happily accepted, not realizing the danger that lurked behind his kindness. 

He grabbed me by the arm and pulled me into his car. I was paralyzed with fear and could hardly move or scream. He drove down a desolate road and parked in an abandoned area. 

Trembling with fear, I felt the cold sweat trickling down my back. The man approached me with a malicious look in his eyes. He was going to do something awful to me, I was sure of it. 

Suddenly, I remembered my parentsâ€™ advice to fight back and never to give up. Summoning all the courage I could muster, I kicked and scratched at the man, breaking free from his grip. 

I ran for my life, not looking back, tears streaming down my face. I finally reached a busy street, where my screams alerted a kind stranger who called the police. 

The man was caught and put in jail, but the memory of that day will forever haunt me. I learned a valuable lesson about the dangers that lurk in this world and how to protect myself from them.
