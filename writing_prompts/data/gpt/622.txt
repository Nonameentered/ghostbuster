Growing up, I always knew that my older brother, Michael, was destined for greatness. He was incredibly intelligent, charming, and had a way of making everyone around him feel loved and appreciated. It was no surprise when he was accepted into one of the top universities in the country and went on to become a successful lawyer.

As for me, I was always the quiet one in the family. I had average grades in school, didn't participate in any extracurricular activities, and had no notable talents or passions. I was simply the insignificant sibling of a great soul.

Despite this, Michael always made sure to include me in his life. He would take me to his college football games, invite me to his law firm's Christmas parties, and call me just to chat. He never made me feel like I was less important than him, and for that, I will always be grateful.

Years passed, and while Michael was making a name for himself in the legal world, I was struggling to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. I tried different jobs, but none of them felt fulfilling. I didn't have a clear purpose or direction, and it made me feel lost.

One day, while scrolling through social media, I came across a video of a volunteer program in Africa. They were looking for people to come to a remote village and teach English to the local children. Something about this opportunity spoke to me, and before I knew it, I had applied and been accepted.

I spent six months in that village, living with a host family and teaching English to children with no access to education. It was a transformative experience, and for the first time in my life, I felt like I was doing something that mattered.

When I returned home, I expected my family to be proud of me, but instead, they seemed indifferent. Michael was caught up in his own busy life, and my parents were more concerned with the latest updates on his career than on my journey.

At first, I was hurt by their lack of enthusiasm, but then I realized that my journey was not about them. It was about me and my own personal growth.

I decided to continue volunteering and ended up traveling to several other countries over the next few years. I taught English in Cambodia, worked with refugees in Greece, and helped build houses in rural Mexico. I was constantly learning new things about different cultures and ways of life, and it filled me with a sense of purpose that I had never felt before.

During this time, Michael's career continued to skyrocket. He had become a partner at his law firm and was now representing some of the biggest companies in the world. He had also met and married a beautiful woman and had started a family.

While I was happy for him, I couldn't help but feel envious of his seemingly perfect life. He had achieved everything that society deems as successful, while I was still wandering aimlessly, trying to find a place where I belonged.

One day, during a family dinner, Michael started talking about a case he was working on. It was a big one, involving a multi-billion-dollar corporation accused of exploiting workers in developing countries.

As he spoke, I couldn't help but think about the people I had met on my travels who had been victimized by companies like the one Michael was defending. These people had no voice, no power, and no hope. And here was my brother, representing the very people who were causing their suffering.

I couldn't keep my thoughts to myself and spoke up. "How can you defend a company that does such terrible things to people?" I asked him.

Michael looked at me with a mix of shock and bewilderment. "It's just business, sis," he said with a shrug.

But I couldn't accept that answer. I realized in that moment that success and greatness are not defined by the size of your bank account or the prestige of your job title. They are defined by the impact you make on the world and the legacy you leave behind.

I may never be a famous lawyer like my brother, but I know that I am making a difference in my own small way. And in the end, that's all that really matters.
