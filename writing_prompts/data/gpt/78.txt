When anyone is born, they are given a playing card from a standard deck, and it determines their place in society.
As soon as it was discovered that every newborn was given a playing card from a standard deck, society was divided.

The Aces, Kings, Queens, and Jacks were the highest of our society, while the middle cards, 10s, 9s, and 8s, were the middling classes, and the lowly 7s, 6s, 5s, 4s, and 3s were at the bottom of society.

Children from wealthy families were expected to be born an Ace or a King. Families would have children just to have a higher chance of one of them being superior. If a child's card was not what their family expected, they were given away or shamed.

Carter was born in the slums of the city, his parents at the bottom of society, and his card was a 6. His parents were devastated, knowing what lay ahead for their son, but kept him close to them in the hope of finding some happiness.

Growing up, Carter watched as his friends were drafted into hard labor, forced to work in factories with no hope of advance. As the years went by, Carter saw more and more people take a chance on violence, leading to a life of crime. Carter refused to fall into the same pattern of behavior. Instead, he kept his head down, focused on his education, and earned a degree.

With his education, Carter managed to acquire a decent-paying job, which was far better than his previous situation. He even managed to obtain a wife whose family was a higher class than his, giving him access to a lifestyle that was previously impossible. However, he was still bitter that he was limited in his potential simply because of a card handed to him at birth.

Years later, after putting all his energy into making a better life, Carter made it to the upper class. He never forgot about the difficulty that lower-class citizens faced and devoted his entire life to making a change. Though Carter never quite came to terms with the card he was handed at birth, he was determined to show people that their birthright did not determine their future, one person at a time.
