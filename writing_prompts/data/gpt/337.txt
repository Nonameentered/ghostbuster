I was driving down the highway, lost in thought, when a car ran a red light and headed straight towards me. I saw the car coming at me and had no time to react. I closed my eyes and shouted at the top of my lungs, "Jesus take the wheel!"

In those few seconds, my life flashed before my eyes, and I was convinced that I was going to die. The impact was inevitable, and there was nothing I could do to stop it. Suddenly, I heard screeching tires, and everything came to a halt. I opened my eyes to see that I was still alive, and I was grateful.

But then, something strange caught my attention. Jesus wasn't driving the car. Instead, there was a tall man with a beard, dressed in black leather, looking at me with a sly smile on his face.

"Who are you?" I demanded.

"I am Lucifer, and you asked me to take the wheel," he said with a chuckle.

I was stunned. I had called upon Jesus but had gotten the devil instead. Was this some kind of joke, or was I losing my mind?

"Listen, I didn't mean to call you. I meant to call on Jesus. Can you please take me back?" I begged.

Lucifer laughed, "Sorry, sweetheart, you're stuck with me for a while. Maybe we can have some fun."

"What do you want from me?" I asked, trembling with fear.

"Oh, I don't want anything from you. I just want to make you a deal," Lucifer said, his eyes gleaming.

"A deal? What kind of deal?"

"You'll find out." Lucifer smirked.

I couldn't believe what was happening. I had just cheated death, and now I was in the company of the devil. What was going to happen to me?

As we drove down the highway, I prepared myself for the worst. I never expected to meet the devil, but here I was. I didn't know what was in store for me, but I was sure that it wouldn't be good. I had called upon Jesus, but instead, I had gotten the devil, and now I was paying the price.
