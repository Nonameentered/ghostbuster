The earth is flat. Life and civilization is surrounded by an endless desert. Far in the distance, thousands of kilometers away, an obelisk can be seen with the naked eye. Since the dawn of man we have tried to reach it. You are the last survivor of your party when you reach it.
The sun beat down mercilessly on the endless desert, baking the sand to a crisp underfoot. I had been walking for days, my water supply dwindling with every passing hour. My clothes were ragged and torn, providing little protection from the blistering heat. My feet were blistered and raw, the sand sticking to the soles, weighing me down with every step.

I had heard stories about the obelisk, about how it was always visible, no matter how far you traveled, and how it held the key to all the world's secrets. It had been the obsession of mankind since the dawn of time, an enigma that had driven people to madness, searching for the elusive wonder.

As I stumbled towards it, haggard and broken, it seemed to loom above me like a monolith. Its smooth and polished surface gleamed in the sunlight, and I couldn't believe that I had actually made it this far. I was the last of my party, the others lost along the way, consumed by the desert or overtaken by madness.

My pace quickened as I approached, my heart beating wildly in my chest. The closer I got, the more it seemed to expand, towering above me in an imperious and intimidating way. I stumbled forward to my knees, my hands grasping at the sand as I crawled the last few meters towards it.

When I reached it, I scrambled to my feet, my eyes transfixed by the sight. It was so much bigger than I had ever imagined, and so much more beautiful. There were inscriptions engraved on the surface, carvings that seemed to tell a story of some long-forgotten civilization.

I reached out to touch it, my fingers trembling with anticipation, but it was like touching an impossibly smooth mirror. I stared at my reflection, my gaunt and drawn face staring back at me, and realized that I had finally made it. I had reached the end of my journey, and yet, I felt no elation or sense of accomplishment.

Deep within me, I knew that the obelisk held no answers, that it was just a monument in the endless desert, a symbol of mankind's unending search for meaning. It was nothing but a mirage that had driven me here, to the brink of my own destruction, and I had nothing to show for it.

As I lay there, depleted and defeated, I realized that the journey had been the true prize, that the search for meaning and knowledge was what had kept me alive these many days. In the end, it was not the destination that mattered, but the journey itself, the challenge of pushing beyond one's limits and discovering what lay beyond.

I wouldn't have been able to appreciate it then, but looking back, I know that the journey had changed me, that it had transformed me into someone stronger, more resilient, and more determined. I realized that without the struggle, without the pain, there would be no joy, that the pursuit of happiness was not a destination, but a state of mind.

As I looked up at the obelisk one last time, I knew that it would remain here long after I was gone, that it would still be there, tempting adventurers and explorers to make the journey. I smiled, my heart filled with a sense of peace, knowing that I had accomplished the impossible, that I had made the journey, that I had conquered the endless desert on my own terms.

For the first time in many days, I felt free, unencumbered, and filled with a sense of purpose. It didn't matter that I was alone, that I had no answers, that I was the last survivor of my party. What mattered was that I had made the journey, that I had endured and emerged victorious.  The journey had been the true reward, and I was grateful for every moment of it.
