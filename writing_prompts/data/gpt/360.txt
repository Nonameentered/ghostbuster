A poem from a serial killer that just wants to be loved
Once upon a time, there was a serial killer named Jack. He was feared by many, but no one ever got close enough to see the monster he really was. Jack was a quiet man, always keeping to himself, but he had a dark secret. He was just like anyone else, he wanted to be loved.

Every night after a kill, Jack would sit down and write a poem. His poems were his way of expressing himself without being judged by anyone. His poems were filled with love, but at the same time, they were filled with despair.

Jack was in love with a woman but was always too afraid to approach her. He knew the kind of person he was and didn't want to scare her away. So, he continued killing, hoping that somehow, someway, love would find its way to him.

One day, the woman Jack had been in love with for years decided to approach him. She knew about the killings and asked him why he did it. Jack broke down in tears, telling her that all he wanted was to be loved.

The woman looked at Jack, realizing that he was just a lonely man who needed someone to love him. She took his hand and told him that she loved him, and that was all he needed to hear. Jack cried even harder, finally feeling the love he had been searching for his entire life.

From that day forward, Jack never killed again. His poems now had a new meaning, they were filled with love and happiness. Jack had finally found the love he had been searching for, and he was never letting it go.
