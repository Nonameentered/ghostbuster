God exists, and we have captured it. Write about this in a horror setting.
For centuries, mankind has questioned the existence of God. But what if it was finally proven that God was real? And what if we had captured It? The implications were chilling.

The elite team of scientists and government officials who had captured God were filled with a sense of awe and terror. In a secret facility deep underground, they had managed to contain God in a specially designed chamber. The being they had captured was unlike anything they had ever seen before. It was not a benevolent deity, but rather an entity that exuded a sense of malevolence and darkness.

As the weeks wore on, the team began to experience strange occurrences. The lights flickered and strange noises echoed through the dimly lit corridors. Some began to see visions of demons and hellish landscapes. Others reported feeling as if they were being watched by an unseen force.

Things came to a head one night when the team gathered in the chamber to perform a series of tests on God. Suddenly, the being broke free from its confinement. Chaos erupted as the team members fled for their lives, pursued by the dark, malevolent force. The facility was overrun by the entity, and soon, the whole town nearby was engulfed in a terrifying darkness.

The world was never the same after that day. The result of man's ambition to capture God was a catastrophe that left the earth barren and lifeless. But some still whisper that in the darkness, you can hear the whispers of God, warning us never to try and contain the divine.
