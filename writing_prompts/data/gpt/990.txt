The Olympic Games now have one average person compete in each event, to better contrast the skill of the athletes. You're one of those average people, however no-one, including yourself, can figure out how you're absolutely dominating your event.
As I walked into the colossal athletics stadium, surrounded by thousands of spectators, I felt a mixture of exhilaration and trepidation. This was the Olympic Games, the biggest stage in the world for athletes to compete in their respective sports, and here I was, a simple average person, about to participate in the archery tournament.

The buzz around the stadium was palpable as the previous competitor took their final shot, while I was preparing my own bow. Then, the announcer introduced me. "And now, ladies and gentlemen, it's time for our average person competitor, John Smith!"

As I walked from the shadows of the staging area onto the central arena, the huge crowd burst into applause. It was an overwhelming moment, and the pressure was immense. I had been chosen to participate in this historic event because I had no professional background in archery, just like all the other average people selected for each of the athletics events in these Olympic Games.

But as I stood there, with all eyes in the stadium trained on me, my nerves started to evaporate. In that moment, I felt a sense of calmness, and my focus became crystal clear. It felt like I was in a tunnel, with the target at the far end being the only thing that mattered.

My first shot was surprisingly accurate, hitting the bullseye. Then my second shot, and my third, all of them perfectly placed. The crowd was amazed, and I was, too. How was it possible that I, an average person, was performing better than the professional archers who had devoted their entire lives to this sport?

I should tell you a bit about myself. I'm a middle-aged man, living in a small town in the Midwest. I work as a geography teacher, and my only experience with archery came from a college elective. I never considered myself to be particularly athletic, yet here I was, hitting shot after shot, each one more precise than the last.

As I took my final shot, the crowd was on the edge of their seats, waiting for the arrow to hit the target. And when it did, the entire stadium erupted with cheers and applause. I had won the archery tournament, becoming the first average person in Olympic history to do so.

I couldn't believe it. To be honest, I didn't know how it had happened. It's not like I had any secret technique or a particular way of shooting that was unique. It was just...natural. And that's how it continued in the following days, with each of the events. The average person in the javelin throw broke the world record, while in the 100 meters, the average person outpaced the fastest athlete on the planet.

It quickly became clear that each of the average people selected for the Olympic Games had a similar story to mine. We had no formal training in our respective sports, yet we were all dominating in ways that seemed impossible. The world was left to wonder: how did we do it?

As word spread throughout the world about the average person's success, I was invited to appear on TV shows and speak at conferences. Every interviewer asked me the same question: "What's your secret?"

But I didn't have an answer. I didn't know how I had done it. It felt like every time I stepped on the field, my body just knew what to do, and it all felt effortless. There was no physical strain or mental calculation. It was pure instinct.

After the uproar of the Olympic Games began to settle, I returned home, still trying to figure out how I had won the archery tournament. I had brought my bow with me and decided to shoot some arrows behind my house. I hadn't shot in a while since college, but when I picked up the bow, it felt familiar.

I aimed at the target, released the arrow, and hit the bullseye. It was as if something had clicked in my mind. I could almost feel the exact position, angle, and pressure required to shoot correctly. It was like allowing my body to take over without thinking.

And with each shot I made, I began to understand what had happened during the Olympic Games. It wasn't just that every average competitor had inadvertently unlocked our hidden potential, but that we had all tapped into a side of ourselves that we didn't know existed. It was the potential to perform beyond our physical boundaries, a potential that we all possess.

I'm still not sure how to explain it, but maybe that's the beauty of it all. The realization that it wasn't just about skill, but about discovering something within ourselves that we didn't know existed. It's that unique quality that makes us all exceptional in our own way.

I'll never forget that Olympic Games, or the feeling I had the first time I shot my arrow. It's something that will stay with me forever. And who knows, maybe it's something that will inspire all the average people in the world to explore their own potentials, to take a shot at greatness.
