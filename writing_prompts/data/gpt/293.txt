I opened my eyes and was suddenly blinded by the bright light. I tried to move, but I couldn't. Panic set in as I realized that I was a baby. The last thing I remember was dying, yet here I was, in a new body.

As I grew, I began to understand the world around me. I couldn't speak or walk, but I could feel and perceive everything. Strangely, I realized that I was connected to this child in a way that I couldn't explain. It was like I was the child's conscience, always guiding and teaching them right from wrong.

Over the years, my role as the child's conscience became clearer to me. Whenever they were about to make a mistake, I would steer them in the right direction. Making sure they did the right thing became my sole purpose.

As time passed, the child grew into an adult, and I continued to be their conscience. I watched as they made mistakes and learned from them. It was almost like I was reliving my own life, but from a different perspective.

Finally, as the child took their last breath, I felt a sense of closure. I had fulfilled my role in guiding them through life, and now it was time to move on to the next stage of my existence.
