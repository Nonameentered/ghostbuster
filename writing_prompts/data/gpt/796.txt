A person, worn out by society, retreats from it.
Anthony was fed up with society. He was done with the constant hustle and bustle of life. He had a good job, a beautiful wife, and two lovely kids. But despite all this, he felt empty and unfulfilled. He needed to escape.

Anthony longed for a quieter, simpler existence. So he retreated to a small cabin in the woods. There, he could be alone with his thoughts and free from the demands of society. The cabin was small, but it had everything he needed: running water, electricity, and a cozy bed.

The first few days were tough. Anthony missed his family, and he felt guilty for leaving them behind. But as time went on, he grew to love his new way of life. He spent his days hiking in the woods, reading, and writing. He felt an inner calmness that he had never experienced before.

He lived this way for six months. He didn't have any contact with the outside world, except for the occasional visit from the mailman. He had no social media accounts and didn't own a television. He was completely cut off from society, and it was exactly what he needed.

Eventually, Anthony emerged from his self-imposed isolation and returned to society. He went back to his old job and reunited with his family. But he was different. He no longer cared about material possessions or status. He had found something much more important, something that no amount of money could buy: inner peace.
