I woke up to the sound of a loud knock on my door. As I opened it, I saw a group of people standing outside, all looking at me with a mix of admiration and fear in their eyes. I had never seen any of them before, but they all seemed to know who I was.

"Can we speak to you for a moment?" one of them asked.

"Who are you?" I said, still feeling a bit confused.

"We're time travelers," the person said, almost as if it were a casual thing. "We've come to see you."

"To see me?" I repeated, still not sure what was happening.

"Yes. You're famous in the future, you know."

"I am?" I said, feeling even more confused than before.

"We can't give too much away," one of them said, with a solemn expression. "But let's just say that you do something incredible."

"Or terrible," someone else added, and they all looked at each other, as if they were trying to decide whether or not to tell me something.

"What do you mean?" I asked, starting to feel a bit anxious.

"Well, it's complicated," the first person said. "But let's just say that your actions in the future have had a big impact on the world."

"Good or bad?" I said, feeling like I was getting nowhere.

"Both, really."

"But why are you here?" I asked, starting to feel like this was some kind of elaborate prank.

"Because we wanted to see the person behind the legend," someone else said. "We wanted to see you."

I wasn't sure how to respond to that, so I just stood there, feeling more and more uncomfortable. It was strange to think that people from the future had come to see me, as if I was some kind of celebrity.

"We won't be here for long," someone else said. "But we just wanted to say hi and see you in person."

And with that, they all turned and started to walk away. As I watched them go, I felt a strange mixture of emotions: curiosity, confusion, apprehension. Who were these people, and what did they want from me?

Over the next few days, more and more time travelers started to appear. Some of them were friendly and curious, others were hostile and aggressive. But all of them seemed to be drawn to me for some reason. They would come and go, always leaving me with more questions than answers.

It wasn't until a few weeks later that I finally got some clarity. I was sitting in a coffee shop when someone approached me.

"Excuse me," he said. "Can I talk to you for a minute?"

"Sure," I said, feeling a bit wary.

"You don't know me," he said. "But I know you."

"Okay," I said, trying to keep an open mind.

"I've come from the year 2175," he said. "And I've come to see you because of what you did in the future."

"What did I do?" I asked, feeling a bit scared.

"You saved the world," he said, with a mix of awe and reverence.

"I did?" I said, feeling like this was some kind of joke.

"Yes," he said. "You saved us all. You did something truly incredible, and I just wanted to come and thank you in person."

I didn't know what to say to that. It seemed so impossible, so far-fetched. But the more he talked, the more I started to believe him.

"And that's why so many of us are coming back in time," he continued. "We want to see the person who saved us all. We want to thank you, and honor your memory."

I still didn't know what to say, so I just sat there, feeling overwhelmed. It was strange to think that something I would do in the future could have such a big impact. But at the same time, it was also kind of exciting. Maybe I was capable of doing something amazing after all. 

As the days and weeks went on, more and more time travelers came to see me. Some of them came to thank me, others came to ask for my help. But all of them seemed to be drawn to me for the same reason: because of something I would do in the future.

It was strange, to be the subject of so much attention. But it was also kind of exhilarating, knowing that I had the potential to do something truly great. And who knows, maybe one day I would. Maybe one day I would save the world.
