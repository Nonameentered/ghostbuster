Paint a picture of loneliness, without using the word, or any of its forms.
She lived in a small, dimly lit apartment on the outskirts of the bustling city. The once vibrant walls were now a dull shade of grey, and the only sounds that filled the room were those of the ticking clock and the faint hum of the refrigerator. The furniture, though comfortable, looked outdated and worn, as if it had been passed down from generation to generation. 

A single photograph hung on the wall - a cherished memory from a lifetime past. It depicted the woman and her family, smiling and happy. The picture seemed to mock her as she sat alone on the couch, tears streaming down her face. She wished she could go back to those days, when the people she cared about the most were still around. Now, there was no one. 

She spent her days staring blankly at the television, watching people on the screen lead lively and adventurous lives. She couldn't help but feel envious of them, as they had a purpose and a sense of belonging. She, on the other hand, had nothing. 

The loneliness was suffocating, like a weight on her chest that never lifted. She longed for human connection, for someone to hold her hand and tell her that everything would be alright. But there was no one. And so she sat, alone in her apartment, lost in her thoughts and consumed by the emptiness that had become her life.
