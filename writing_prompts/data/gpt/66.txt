Everyone has superpowers, but the richer you are, the weaker your powers become.
Once upon a time, everyone on earth had a superpower, providing them with unique and astounding abilities. Some people could run at breakneck speeds, others could lift enormous weights, and some could even fly. As it turns out, as a person's wealth increased, their ability to utilize their power decreased.

Landon was the richest person in the world, with a net worth that exceeded tens of billions of dollars. Despite his astounding wealth, however, his superpower was entirely ineffective. Growing up, he showed incredible promise with his ability - he could phase through solid objects, moving through walls and doors like they weren't even there.

However, as he grew older and began amassing his wealth, the effectiveness of his abilities waned. Today, in his sprawling mansion, he could barely pass through a screen door. Still, he couldn't help but feel that he had it better than many of his fellow multi-millionaires and billionaires whose powers had been almost entirely nullified.

Landon's father, the previous wealthiest person on earth until his death, had always told him that the source of this change in power was the price that people paid for their wealth. According to family stories, long before Landon's birth, there had been an agreement between supernatural quanta and humans. Those who held more power would have to pay more for it, while those with less would flourish.

It wasn't something that was commonly spoken about, but it was something Landon thought about often. He couldn't help but wonder how different his life would have been if his power had continued to flourish as his wealth had grown. Instead, he was stuck here, a pale shadow of his former self, trying to find some semblance of joy in his extravagance.

In a world where wealth was the most highly valued thing, and those who held it were often envied and put on a pedestal, Landon remained eternally aware of what he had lost because of it. Yet he couldn't help but feel that his story was still one of an incredible success. After all, he was still alive, still breathing, and still able to enjoy the trappings of his great wealth. Perhaps that was a power that he held that no one else in the world did.
