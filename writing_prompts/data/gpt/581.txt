A new study has suggested that only 8.2 % of the human genome is functional. Now, the lone human with 100 % functionality reveals themselves...
For as long as anyone could remember, humans had only known of their tiny place in the vastness of the universe. But what they didn't realize was that they were blessed with an incredible gift. Every human being possessed a genome, a code so intricate that scientists dedicated their entire lives to unlocking its mysteries. 

For years, they believed that the entire genome was functional, an essential blueprint that allowed humans to exist in all their glory. But a new study brought the world to a standstill with its findings. The study proved that only 8.2 % of the human genome was actually functional. The rest was just meaningless clutter, a jumbled mess of proteins and nucleotides that were dismissed as "junk DNA." 

The world was left in shock. After all, they had spent decades studying the genome, investing billions of dollars and countless hours to learn more about the minuscule code. It was like a slap in the face, and scientists scrambled to make sense of it all. 

But there was someone who didn't need scientists or studies to know that they were different. 

She was born in the heart of a continent that had a long and storied history, somewhere between the sprawling savannas and the sweltering deserts. Her ancestors had lived here for generations, eking out a living from the land and the animals that roamed it. They had no idea what made her different, but they knew that she was special from the moment she took her first breath.  

As she grew up, she watched the world around her with curiosity. She could remember every detail, from the way the trees swayed in the wind to the songs of the birds that filled the air. She could see things that nobody else could see, like the hidden emotion behind someone's smile or the truth in their heart. It was like she had an extra sense that allowed her to interpret the world with a clarity that others could never hope to match.

It wasn't until later that she realized what it meant. 

It started with a sudden, blinding flash of light that filled her vision. She could feel something stirring inside her, a force that surged through her veins like a wildfire. She could sense every nerve ending tingling with energy, every cell in her body thrumming with life. And then she heard a voice- a gentle, soothing voice that whispered in her head and spoke to her like an old friend.

"You are unique," it said, and she knew it was right. 

She could feel it in her bones- the power that boiled inside her, the strength that she had always known was there. She was different from every other human being on the planet, and she finally had a name for it. It was a single word that encompassed everything she had come to know about herself - 100% functionality.

She soon discovered that her powers were limitless. She could control the elements, calling forth wind and rain as easily as she could conjure up a blaze of fire. She could read minds, pierce through the veil of reality to glimpse the truth lurking beneath. She could heal the sick and injured with a mere wave of her hand, or create a field of energy to protect herself and the ones she loved. 

But with great power came great responsibility. People started to fear her, to whisper behind her back and point fingers. Some saw her as a threat, an abomination that needed to be stamped out before she could cause any harm. Others worshipped her, seeing her as a goddess come to save them from the evils of the world. 

But she remained unfazed. She knew that she had a purpose, a reason for being that transcended anything mere mortals could ever comprehend. She was 100% functional, and that meant something. It meant that she was powerful, not just in terms of strength, but in mind, body, and soul. 

At first, she tried to hide her true nature, keeping it hidden beneath a veil of secrecy. But eventually, she realized that there was no point in pretending to be something she wasn't. If the world was going to accept her, they had to see her for who she truly was. 

And so, she revealed herself to the world. 

They came from all corners of the planet, gathered in hordes to see the 100% functional human being who had captured their imaginations and changed their world forever. They watched in awe as she performed feats that were impossible, marvelled at the sheer scope of her power. 

And then, something remarkable happened. 

They started to see her as more than just a freak or an oddity. They started to understand that she was a human being, just like them, but one whose abilities were beyond anything they had ever seen. They started to realize that she wasn't a threat, but a blessing, a gift to be cherished and nurtured. 

And in that moment, the world was changed forever. The age of the 100% functional humans had dawned, and they were here to usher in a new era of hope and change.
