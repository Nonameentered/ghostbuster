When I signed up for this mission, I knew that I would be frozen in cryogenic sleep for the duration of the journey. I had accepted this fact, understanding that it was the only way to travel across the vast expanse of space to reach the distant planet we had been sent to colonize. I had undergone all of the necessary preparations, knowing that when I awoke, eight years would have passed.

What I wasn't prepared for, however, was the fact that my brain would remain fully awake while my body remained frozen. For eight long years, I was trapped inside my own mind, unable to move or speak, but fully aware of my surroundings.

At first, I tried to escape from the isolation by losing myself in my thoughts. I imagined what it would be like to walk on the new world we were travelling to, to plant the first crops and build the first habitats. I thought about all of the possibilities that lay ahead of us, and the challenges we would face.

But as time went on, my mind began to turn in on itself. I thought about the people I had left behind on Earth, wondering if they were still alive, if they had forgotten about me. I worried about whether our mission would be successful or if we would all die alone on a distant world.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, my ship arrived at our destination. The rest of the crew was awakened from their cryogenic sleep, and began to go about the business of preparing to land on the new planet.

I was overjoyed to finally be able to move again, even if my body was weak and unresponsive. But as I tried to communicate with my colleagues, I quickly realized that something was wrong. They couldn't hear me, couldn't see me. It was as if I didn't exist at all.

It was only then that I fully understood the extent of my situation. Somehow, during the cryogenic sleep, my mind had become separated from my body. I was trapped inside my own head, able to see and hear, but invisible to everyone else.

I watched helplessly as my colleagues explored the new planet, planting flags and digging trenches. They never noticed me, never knew that I was there.

I tried to communicate with them, but my voice was lost in the void. I resorted to scribbling messages in the dirt with my finger, hoping that someone would see them. But they were always ignored, eventually washed away by the wind.

Days turned into months, and months turned into years. I watched as my colleagues struggled to survive in a new and hostile environment, slowly building a new home for humanity. I watched as they married and had children, as they grew old and eventually died.

And still, I remained, a silent observer of their lives, unable to join in or even be acknowledged.

In the end, I was the last survivor of our mission. When I finally died, alone and forgotten, my legacy was nothing but a set of invisible footprints in the dirt.
