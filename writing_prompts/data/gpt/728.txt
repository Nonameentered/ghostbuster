You have had a musical score since you were born, that only you can hear, and use it to gauge situations. Tell us your perspective about September 11, 2001.
I remember September 11, 2001 as if it was yesterday. I was sitting in my classroom, staring out the window, when I felt a sudden shift in my musical score. It was a low, ominous hum that grew louder and louder. I knew something was wrong.

Soon enough, my teacher received a phone call, and her face turned grim. She turned on the news, and we watched in horror as the Twin Towers were hit by planes. My heart sank as the music in my head grew louder and more chaotic. I had never heard anything like it before.

As the day went on, I tried my best to keep the music under control. It was like a raging orchestra, each instrument trying to outdo the other. It was overwhelming, but I knew I had to use it to gauge the situation.

I remember feeling a sense of unity as people came together to help one another in the aftermath of the attacks. The music in my head began to quiet down, becoming more peaceful, like a solo violin playing a mournful melody.

In the days and months that followed, I watched as the world changed. There were moments of fear and uncertainty, but also moments of hope and resilience. My musical score reflected this, shifting between chaotic dissonance and peaceful resolve.

Now, twenty years later, I still carry the memory of that day with me. The music in my head has become a part of who I am, a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the strength of the human spirit. I know that I will never forget the events of September 11, 2001, and the impact they had on the world and on me.
