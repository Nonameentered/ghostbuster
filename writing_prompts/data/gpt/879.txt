Five to Break My Heart:

I fell in love with him the first time we met. 
He whispered sweet nothings in my ear, and I believed every word. 
But then he started to pull away, and I could feel my heart shattering into pieces. 
It wasn't long before I found out he was cheating on me with my best friend. 
I was left alone, with nothing but a broken heart and shattered dreams.

Five to Reassemble it:

I took time to heal and learn to love myself. 
It wasn't easy, but I slowly pieced my heart back together. 
I met someone new, someone who truly loved and respected me. 
He was patient and kind, and showed me what real love was supposed to feel like. 
With him, I found hope and happiness once again.
