Take the last sentence from the last thing you wrote. That's the beginning of this story.
As she walked down the empty street, she could feel the weight of her decision heavy on her shoulders. What had led her to this point? She thought about her life, the choices she had made, and where it had all gone wrong. 

It wasn't supposed to be like this. When she was younger, she had such big dreams. She was going to travel the world, write books, and be a successful businesswoman. But somehow, the years had slipped away from her, and she found herself stuck in a dead-end job, in a town she didn't even like. 

She knew what she had to do. It was time to take control of her life and make a change. She had to leave this town and start over, somewhere new. She had already made plans, made the necessary arrangements, and booked her flight. 

As the plane took off and rose above the clouds, she could feel the weight of her worries lifting off her shoulders. She had no idea what was waiting for her at the other end, but she knew that it had to be better than where she had been. She was leaving behind everything that had held her back and opening herself up to a new world of possibilities. 

And as she descended into her new city, she felt for the first time in a long time, that she had hope. She was ready to take on whatever came her way, with the strength and courage that had been missing from her life for far too long.
