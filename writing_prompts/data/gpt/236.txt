In the world I live in, every pain is forever. Yes, that means if you accidentally burn your tongue, it will never, ever go away. It stays with you forever and piles up every time you experience it again. It's like perpetually being trapped in an excruciatingly painful loop with no escape.

At first, people tried to find ways to mitigate the pain. Doctors and scientists threw themselves into researching cures and remedies for everything from headaches to broken bones. But every attempt was met with the same frustrating outcome: temporary relief at best, but never a permanent solution.

Soon enough, society adapted to the new normal. People learned to live with their pain, accepting it as a part of who they were. Some embraced it, even. They became proud of their pain, displaying their scars and injuries like badges of honor.

The culture shifted, too. Pain was no longer something to be avoided or feared. Instead, it was something to be celebrated. Pain became an art form, a way for people to express themselves and connect with others who felt their pain.

Throngs of people flocked to pain festivals and exhibitions, eager to witness the spectacle. There were firewalkers who danced across searing hot coals, acrobats who threw themselves through rings of fire, and self-flagellating monks who whipped themselves into a frenzy.

The more extreme the displays of pain, the more revered the performers. Pain became synonymous with bravery and strength, a measure of a person's physical and emotional endurance.

But there was a darker side to this world, too. Pain became a commodity, something to be bought and sold on the underground market. People with rare, chronic illnesses were hunted and captured, their painful conditions used for the entertainment of the wealthy and voyeuristic.

For those who couldn't afford to buy and sell pain, there was only one option: endure it. Those who couldn't adapt or cope with their pain were deemed weak and ostracized from society.

It was a hard world to exist in. Every stubbed toe was a reminder of the fragility of the human body, of the fact that any moment could trigger a lifetime of suffering. The constant, never-ending pain took a toll on people's mental health, pushing many to the brink of insanity.

But amidst all the pain and suffering, there were those who remained hopeful. They believed that one day, someone would find a cure. They clung to stories of miraculous healings and rare conditions where people's bodies naturally healed themselves.

There was a legend of a man who was born with a rare condition that caused him to feel no pain. Scientists had studied him for years, hoping to somehow replicate his state in others.

Then, one day, he disappeared. Some said he had gone into hiding, scared of being hunted down and exploited for his condition. Others claimed that he had found the secret to healing and was living out the rest of his life in peace.

Regardless of what happened to him, the legend persisted. People whispered his name, hoping that one day they too would be freed from the eternal cycle of pain.

As for me, I was like everyone else, constantly grappling with my own pain. I had learned to cope with it, but that didn't mean it was easy. Every scrape and bruise, every headache and heartbreak - they all piled up inside me, a constant reminder of the world I lived in.

But I refused to give up hope. I believed that one day, someone would find a cure. Maybe it wouldn't happen in my lifetime, or even in the next few centuries, but someday, I knew that pain would no longer be the only defining feature of our existence.

Until then, all I could do was keep going. Keep living, keep feeling, and keep hoping. Because in a world of eternal pain, hope was the strongest weapon we had.
