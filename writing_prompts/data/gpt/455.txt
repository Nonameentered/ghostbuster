Whilst a bank heist is taking place, another group of bandits tries to rob the same bank.
It was supposed to be a simple heist. The plan had been meticulously thought out and timed to the second. The team of thieves had been working together for years, and everything had gone smoothly up until this point. But it was all about to go horribly wrong.

The bank was a small, local branch that had never been hit before. The team had been watching it for weeks, taking note of the comings and goings of the staff and monitoring security procedures. They knew that they had a window of opportunity and they had taken it.

The team started by cutting the power to the building, causing the alarms to go offline. They then moved in with precision, quickly securing the tellers and gathering as much cash as they could fit into their bags. They had just finished bagging up the money when they heard a commotion at the front of the building.

Suddenly, the sound of breaking glass shattered the calm of the night, and the team sprang into action. They knew that their cover had been blown, and they had to make a break for it. As they raced towards the door, they were met by another group of bandits, who had also decided to hit the same bank on the same night.

The two groups of bandits may have been adversaries, but they didn't have time for a full-on confrontation. Instead, they quickly glanced at one another in acknowledgment before fleeing in opposite directions. The original team of thieves ran down the street, their nerves on edge as they heard the sounds of sirens in the distance.

They had just rounded a corner when they were suddenly confronted by a police car, which had been speeding down the road towards them. The team scattered, heading down alleyways and jumping over fences as they tried to lose the pursuing police.

Meanwhile, the rival gang of bandits had a similar experience. They too had been caught off guard by the presence of the other group, and they were forced to make a hasty exit. But where the first team of thieves had escaped into the streets of the city, the second group had gotten lucky in a different way.

As they fled the bank, they noticed an abandoned car parked nearby with its engine still running. Without hesitating, they jumped inside and took off down the street, leaving the bank heist behind them. For a few moments, there was a feeling of relief as they drove away from the bank and the police sirens that were growing louder. But it was short-lived.

As they turned onto a crowded street, they saw red and blue lights flashing in front of them. It was only then that they realized that they had driven straight into a police checkpoint. Before they had a chance to react, the car was surrounded by police, their guns drawn.

The situation was hopeless, and the leader of the gang knew it. He threw up his hands in surrender, and the rest of the group soon followed suit. They were taken into custody, and their fate was sealed.

While the second group of bandits was being arrested, the first group was trying to make sense of what had just happened. They were still on the run, darting in and out of alleyways and dodging police cars at every turn. Eventually, they found themselves in a deserted part of the city, hiding behind a dumpster as they waited for the police to pass.

It was then that they realized the absurdity of what had happened. Two groups of bandits had tried to rob the same bank, and they had ended up hindering each other's success. They laughed at the irony of it all, as they contemplated what the future held for them.

Eventually, they made it back to their hideout, exhausted and frustrated. The take from the heist was meager compared to what they had expected, and they knew that things would never be the same again. But as they sat around, nursing their wounds and planning their next move, they couldn't help but marvel at the strangeness of the situation they had just been through.

Two groups of bandits, trying to rob the same bank on the same night. It was the stuff of fiction, but for them, it was a reality that they would never forget.
