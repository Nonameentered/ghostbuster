The Reverse Alphabet Game- The first CW prompt [Difficulty Level: DAMN NEAR IMPOSSIBLE]
Once upon a time in a land far away, there was a group of friends who loved to play games. But one day they decided to try something new, a game called the Reverse Alphabet Game. The rules were simple: each player had to say a word starting from the last letter of the previous word. For example, if the first word was "zebra", the next player had to say a word starting with the letter "a", like "apple". 

At first, the game was easy. The players laughed and joked as they came up with words to continue the game. But as the game continued, it became more difficult. The players had to think harder and harder to come up with words that started with the correct letter. 

Soon, they struggled to keep the game going. Every time a player stumbled, the others would groan in frustration. Even the most intelligent of the group found themselves struggling to come up with words that were feasible in the game. They tried different strategies like thinking of words in a different language or using proper nouns to cheat slightly, but nothing worked. 

As the game went on, the players became more and more stressed, and they started to argue among themselves. Frustrations boiled over, and they began accusing each other of cheating. It was a complete mess, and soon enough, the game came to an abrupt end. 

The group of friends ended up being more divided than ever. They would argue and fight over the slightest things, and even simple discussions turned into arguments. It seemed that the Reverse Alphabet Game had caused irreparable damage to their friendships. In the end, they all went their separate ways, and the game was never spoken of again. 

The Reverse Alphabet Game had proved to be too difficult for even the closest of friends. It’s important for us to understand that every game isn’t meant for everyone. When things seem to get a bit too hard, it's necessary to take a step back and re-evaluate the situation before proceeding.
