It was supposed to be a simple experiment; a time machine that would send me back 10 years to my 25-year-old self and then bring me back to my present-day at 35. But something went wrong, and I found myself transported not 10 years, but 15 years back. I was now in my 20-year-old body, with no money, no place to stay, and no way to return to my present.

I was lost and confused, not sure what to do next. It was then that I remembered the dorm room where I had spent my early college days. Dorm G-10, a long-forgotten place that I thought I would never return to, was now my only hope.

I arrived at the dorm, hesitating for a moment before knocking on the door of my old room. My younger self answered the door, looking confused and surprised to see a man who looked like his future self.

"What's going on?" he asked.

"I'm you, from the future," I said, hoping that my younger self would believe me.

He looked skeptical, but I managed to convince him by convincing him that I knew things that only he could have known.

However, it was not easy to convince my old self to help me. I had to prove to him that I was indeed who I said I was, and I needed his help to get back to my present-day, as soon as possible. After some convincing, my younger self finally agreed to help me.

Over the next few years, I lived with my old self, trying to blend in with the college crowd, while trying to find a way back to my present-day. I worked odd jobs and went to school, trying to make ends meet.

Living in the past was not as easy as I had expected. Things were different, and the world was not as advanced as it was now. It was frustrating not having access to technology that I had taken for granted in my present-day. However, my younger self helped me to adjust and adapt to the world as it was back then.

Finally, after 5 long years, we found a way for me to return to my present-day. I was relieved and grateful for my younger self's help. I knew that without him, I would never have made it back to my own time.

As I said goodbye to the past and left that dorm room, I vowed never to take anything in my present-day for granted again. I appreciated everything that I had in a way that I had never done before. And I was grateful for the experience of going back in time and learning valuable lessons about what was truly important in life.
