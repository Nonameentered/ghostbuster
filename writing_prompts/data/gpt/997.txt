You hang to life by a literal thread.
As I hung from the cliff’s edge, I felt my strength waning. My fingers ached and slipped on the thin thread, which was my only hope of staying alive. I glanced upwards and saw the jagged rocks looming ominously above me, and then looked down to see the vast expanse of the abyss below me. It was then that I realized how precarious my situation was. The thread had come apart, and I was holding onto two halves of it with my trembling hands. My heart raced as I tried to come up with a plan, but none came to mind. Suddenly, I heard a faint rustling noise and saw a man’s face peering over the cliff's edge. He extended his hand to me, and I grasped it with all my strength. With his help, I scrambled up the cliff side, safe and sound. I vowed to never take my life for granted, and to always pay attention to the small things that could easily be overlooked, as they can be the difference between life and death.
