A man in a hospital sees Death. Death's intentions are not what he expects.
John had been in the hospital for several weeks. He had been in a terrible accident that left him with a broken leg, several broken ribs, and a punctured lung. His recovery had been slow, and the pain was unbearable. He had lost all hope of ever walking again.

One night, John was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, unable to sleep. Suddenly, he sensed a strange presence in the room. He turned his head to see a tall figure standing in the corner of the room.

John's first instinct was to scream, but he couldn't find his voice. Instead, he watched the figure move towards him. It was Death.

John had always imagined Death as a dark, hooded figure with a scythe. However, the Death he saw was different. Death had a human form, and John could see its face. He could see eyes that radiated warmth and comfort. It was a strange sight, and John couldn't believe his eyes.

"Who are you?" John asked in a trembling voice.

"I am Death," said the figure.

"Why are you here?" asked John.

"I am here to take your soul," said Death.

John's heart sank, and a feeling of fear overcame him. He had heard stories about Death taking people's souls, and most of them were terrifying. He had heard that Death was a cold, heartless monster that showed no mercy.

John closed his eyes and waited for Death to take his soul. However, what happened next was something he never expected.

He felt Death's hand on his forehead. It was a gentle touch that brought warmth and comfort to his aching body. He sensed that Death had no intention of taking his soul. Instead, Death was here to heal him.

"I am not here to take your soul, John. I am here to heal you," said Death.

John opened his eyes, and he felt a wave of relief sweep over him. He looked at Death, and he could see that its eyes were filled with compassion.

John's body felt like it was on fire, and he was struggling to catch his breath. He could feel Death's hand on his chest, and it was comforting. Suddenly, he felt a strange force enter his body. It was a powerful light that filled his entire being, and he felt like he was reborn.

John sat up in bed, and he felt amazing. His pain had disappeared, and he could feel his legs again. He was amazed at what had happened. He looked at Death, and he could see that it was smiling at him.

"You are healed, John. You can get up now," said Death.

John stood up, and he could feel his legs supporting his weight. He looked at his body, and he was amazed at what he saw. His wounds had healed, and his bones had mended.

"I don't understand. What happened?" asked John.

"I have healed you, John. You were meant to die, but I have spared you. You have a purpose in this life, and I have given you a second chance," said Death.

John was speechless. He had never heard of anything like this before. He had always thought of Death as an enemy, but now he saw it as a friend. He looked at Death, and he could see that it was glowing.

"Why did you spare me?" asked John.

"You have a purpose, John. You have a gift that you must share with the world. You have the power to heal others, and you must use that gift to help others," said Death.

John was amazed at what he had heard. He had never thought of himself as a healer, but now he knew that was his purpose. He looked down at his hands, and he could see a strange energy radiating from them.

"You have the power to heal, John. I have given you this gift, and you must use it wisely," said Death.

John looked at Death, and he could see that it was preparing to leave.

"Wait, please don't go," said John.

"I must go, John. Your time is not yet up, but the time will come when I will return. Be ready for that day, for it will be your time to go," said Death.

John watched as Death disappeared, leaving him standing there, amazed at what had just happened. He felt a strange sense of peace and clarity. He knew that he had a purpose in life, and he was ready to fulfill it.

From that day onwards, John decided to devote his life to healing others. He became a healer, using the gift that Death had given him. He traveled the world, healing those who were sick and in pain. He knew that his time was precious, and he wanted to make the world a better place.

John never forgot the encounter he had with Death. He knew that it was a message from the other side, and he was grateful for it. He lived his life to the fullest, healing others and spreading love and positivity wherever he went. He knew that when the time came, Death would return, but until then, he was going to live his life to the fullest.
