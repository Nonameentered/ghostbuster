She was almost beautiful.
She was almost beautiful. That was the first thing I noticed about her when I first saw her. She had all the features that a person would look for in a beautiful woman; high cheekbone, long dark hair, and big brown eyes. But there was something about her that made it difficult to accept that she was actually beautiful. It was a sense of emptiness that was reflected in her eyes, as if there was nothing behind them. 

I met her at a train station. I was waiting for my train to arrive and she was sitting alone on a bench, looking dejected. I decided to strike up a conversation with her. She seemed distant at first, but eventually, she warmed up to me. She told me her name was Liana and that she was going through some tough times. 

We talked for a while about ourselves. She told me about her dreams of becoming a dancer when she was younger but had given up after her parents had forced her to stop. I told her about my life as a traveler, how I loved to explore and find beauty in the world. 

As the train came, we parted ways, but something about her had inspired me. I decided to give up my travels and stay in the town where she lived. I wanted to get to know her better. 

We met regularly after that day. Sometimes we would just sit on the bench at the train station, and other times we would go for walks in the nearby park. I discovered that Liana was a poet whose love for words was as passionate as my love for discovery. She scribbled in her notebook every time she was inspired by something in her surroundings. Her words evoked emotions that I had never felt before. I was mesmerized by her, not just because of her almost beautiful features but her words that were so full of feeling. 

One day, Liana asked me to come with her to a local club where she performed as a dancer. I couldn't believe that she had lived in the same town all this time and I had never seen her perform. I eagerly accepted her invitation. 

On the night of her performance, I arrived at the club and took a seat in the front row. The lights dimmed, and the music started. Suddenly, the curtain parted, and there she was, dressed like a princess, ready to enchant us with her moves. I stood there, transfixed as she gracefully twirled, bent and moved her body, following the rhythm of the music. Every inch of her body was in tune with the melody. She was breathtakingly beautiful. 

As she finished her performance, the audience erupted in applause. The look of triumph on her face was as beautiful as the performance itself. I realized that Liana's beauty was not in her almost perfect features but in her passion and her talent. It was her words and moves that made her beautiful. 

After the performance, I hugged her and told her that she was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. Liana held my hand and smiled. For the first time, I saw a spark of fire in her eyes. It was then that I knew that I had fallen in love with her. 

Now, I know that Liana is truly beautiful; not just almost. Through her passion and words, she emanates a beauty that surpasses any physical attribute. I realized that beauty isn't something that we can see with our eyes; it's something that we feel with our hearts.
