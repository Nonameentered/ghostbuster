There's all kinds of dark things in these woods, the old man used to say as he sat on his porch, smoking his pipe. I never paid much attention to him, thinking he was just an old man telling stories to scare children. But after what happened to me, I wish I had listened more closely.

It was a beautiful day in early autumn, and I decided to go for a hike in the woods. I packed my backpack with some water and a sandwich and set off on the trail. The sun was shining, and the leaves were turning orange and yellow, creating a beautiful sight.

As I walked deeper into the woods, I started to feel uneasy. The silence was only broken by the rustling of leaves and the occasional chirp of a bird. I had the feeling someone was watching me, but I told myself it was just my imagination. I continued walking until I reached a clearing.

The clearing was beautiful, filled with wildflowers and tall grass. I decided to stop and rest for a while, taking in the scenery. But as I sat there, I noticed something odd. The leaves around the clearing seemed to be moving, but there was no wind. I tried to brush it off, thinking it was just some small animal, but then I heard a strange sound. It was a low growl, coming from somewhere in the woods.

My heart started racing as I stood up, ready to leave the clearing. But then I saw something that made me freeze in terror. A pair of glowing eyes were staring at me from the darkness, not far from where I was standing. They were green and felt like they were piercing through my soul.

I ran as fast as I could. The growl grew louder, and I could hear something moving in the woods. I didn't look back, afraid of what I might see. I kept running until I reached the trail, feeling like I was being chased the whole time.

When I finally stopped to catch my breath, I realized I had lost my backpack. I didn't dare go back into the woods to retrieve it, not after what I had just experienced. I made my way back to the town, my heart still racing with fear.

For days, I couldn't stop thinking about what had happened to me in the woods. I tried to convince myself it was just a wild animal and that I had overreacted, but I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something more sinister out there.

One night, I decided to ask the old man about it. He had lived in the town all his life, so I figured he might know something about the woods that I didn't.

The old man listened to my story with a grim expression. He didn't say anything for a while, just blew a puff of smoke from his pipe.

"There's all kinds of dark things in these woods," he said at last. "Things that are better left alone."

"What kind of things?" I asked, growing more curious.

The old man stood up and beckoned me to follow him. We walked to the edge of the town, where the woods began. He pointed to a path that led into the woods.

"Take that path," he said. "And you'll get your answers."

I hesitated for a moment, but my curiosity got the better of me. I thanked the old man and set off on the path, feeling like I was about to enter a world of darkness.

The further I walked, the darker it became. The trees loomed over me, their branches tangling together, blocking out the moonlight. But I kept walking, my heart racing with excitement.

And then, I saw it. A small clearing in the woods, illuminated by a single flickering candle. I approached it with caution, expecting to see something horrific. But instead, there was an old man, sitting on a log.

"Welcome," he said with a grin. "I've been expecting you."

He held out his hand, and I noticed he was holding a deck of tarot cards. I hesitated, but then he said something that made me curious.

"Your future is in these woods," he said. "But you must be willing to seek it out."

So, I sat down in front of him, and he began shuffling the cards. He laid them out in a pattern, and I watched with fascination.

"What do you see?" I asked, eager to know what he had found.

"Darkness," he said simply. "You've felt it, haven't you?"

I nodded, feeling a shiver run down my spine.

"But there is a way out," he continued. "It requires courage, but it will lead you to the light."

He handed me a small vial, filled with ash. "This," he said, "will guide you to what you seek. But beware, there are all kinds of dark things in these woods."

With that, he disappeared into the darkness, leaving me alone with the flickering candle.

I didn't know what to do next. But I knew I couldn't ignore the old man's warning. So, I took the vial and set off into the woods.

The ash glowed softly, leading me deeper and deeper into the darkness. I stumbled over roots and dodged branches, feeling like I was being guided by some unseen force.

As I walked, I started to hear strange noises. The growl from before was back, louder and more menacing. I could hear something slithering through the undergrowth, and the fluttering of wings. Something had awoken in the woods, and it was coming for me.

But then, I saw a light in the distance. It was a small beacon, shining through the darkness.

With renewed strength, I ran towards it, until I reached a small cabin. It was old and rundown, with cobwebs draped across the windows and smoke coming from the chimney.

I knocked on the door, my heart racing with fear. But then I heard a voice from inside.

"Who's there?"

I took a deep breath and answered. "It's me. I was guided here by the ash."

The door creaked open, and a woman stood before me. She was old and wrinkled, but her eyes shone with a strange light.

"You've come a long way," she said. "But you're not done yet."

With that, she led me to a small room, where there was a single candle burning. She handed me a book and said, "This is your journey. You must discover what it means."

I opened the book, and it was filled with strange sigils and symbols, unlike anything I had ever seen before.

"Find the meaning," she said. "And you will have found your way out of the darkness."

And so, I sat down and began to read. I spent days and nights poring over the pages, trying to decipher the secrets hidden within.

It was hard work, but I was driven by a fierce determination to discover what lay hidden in the woods. As I read, I started to understand the strange symbols, and what they represented. Slowly but surely, the darkness lifted, and I found my way out of the woods.

Now, I sit on my porch, smoking my pipe, just like the old man did before me. But I know there's so much more to the woods than what meets the eye. There are all kinds of dark things in these woods, waiting to be discovered by those who are brave enough to seek them out. And who knows? You might just find your way out of the darkness too.
