For centuries, I have roamed the streets, preying on those I deemed unworthy of life. I am an immortal serial killer, and there was nothing that could stop me from fulfilling my insatiable desire for death.

But eventually, I was caught. Despite my best efforts, the police managed to trap me. I was tried and sentenced to life in prison, behind bars and away from the thrill of the hunt.

The years passed, and inmates came and went. But I remained, unchanging and unaffected by the passage of time. The prison warden grew suspicious, wondering why I refused to age like all the other prisoners.

He sent doctors to examine me, but they could find no explanation for my apparent immortality. Tensions grew as rumors spread throughout the prison, and some began to claim that I was a demon or some other unnatural being.

The warden himself began to fear for his own safety, worried that I was somehow responsible for my lack of aging. He ordered that I be kept in solitary confinement, away from the other prisoners and carefully monitored.

Yet, even as the years continued to pass, I remained unchanged, a constant enigma to all who encountered me. I watched as the warden and his staff grew grey and frail, while I remained young and full of vigor.

And still, I waited, biding my time and plotting my escape. For even in this prison, I was not truly trapped. I was an immortal, and there was always a way out.
