It was a Monday like any other until something incredible and bizarre happened. As I walked down the street, I noticed other people around me walking and stopping in surprise. It seemed as if almost everyone had developed a superpower overnight.

I was one of the lucky ones – or unlucky, depending on how I looked at it. When I woke up earlier that day, I soon realized that I could manipulate time. At first, I thought it was cool, but it quickly became apparent that it was also terrifying. I could mess with other people’s lives without their knowing, and that was a scary thought.

I headed to work and met my usual lunchtime crowd in the break room. There were four of us, all colleagues in the same department. They all knew about each other's new superpowers. Julia could fly, Ken could read people’s minds, and Tim had developed the ability to teleport. They all boasted about their powers, excitedly sharing their experiences and making us all envious of their newfound abilities.

But then they turned to me. They asked what I could do. I didn't know what to say, so I simply shook my head and said, "Nothing. I'm just a normal human being." I lied through my teeth. I have learned quickly that it was best not to show anyone how to manipulate time.

My co-workers didn't seem to believe me, but I let it slide. Instead, I listened as they continued to brag about their powers. It was fascinating, and it made me realize how much potential I had to cause trouble. I could mess with their minds all I wanted without them ever knowing.

A few days later, Julia was insisting that she could fly, but nobody believed her. She tried to levitate in the air to prove it, but every time she tried, she plummeted to the ground. I, of course, knew the real reason. I had slowed down time on her without her realizing it, and it made it impossible for her to fly.

It wasn't just my co-workers that I would fool around with. Whenever I found myself in a difficult situation, all I had to do was manipulate the flow of time to my advantage. I could make it appear that I had already finished my work hours before I actually did so, giving me more free time.

I have to admit that my powers made me feel invincible, almost like a deity of sorts. I didn't have any trouble sleeping at night, knowing full well that nobody would ever learn what I could do.

However, I soon found out that my power had its limitations. Whenever I tried to manipulate time too much or too often, I would feel drained and exhausted. It was as if I was pushing against some kind of invisible wall, and the consequences would soon catch up with me.

As time passed, I slowly began to regret lying to my colleagues about my powers. I couldn't share my secret with my closest friends and colleagues, which was frustrating. But I was also aware of the consequences of exposing my power to others. It would spook them, and I would lose my own superhero status.

By this point, I had realized that having superpowers wasn't all that it's cracked up to be. The sheer weight of responsibility that came with it was overwhelming. I was always on the lookout for dangers, trying to anticipate any potential problems and avoid them ahead of time.

In the end, I decided that it was best to keep my power to myself. I wasn't interested in showing off or being a superhero. Instead, I would use my abilities sparingly and discreetly to get by.

I've learned that having superpowers isn't always what it seems. They're not always a gift or a blessing, but rather a curse. The excitement and thrill of having abilities like those of a superhero quickly wear off, replaced by an overwhelming sense of responsibility and accountability.
