Sara and her husband had always dreamed of traveling the world. But with busy work schedules and the demands of raising two children, they kept putting it off. Until one day, they received some devastating news - Sara had been diagnosed with a terminal illness.

In the midst of their grief and fear, Sara and her husband made a decision. They would spend what time they had left fulfilling their dream of travel, no matter how difficult it might be. They sold their home and most of their possessions, said goodbye to friends and family, and set off on a journey around the globe.

There were times when Sara's illness made things tough. But they saw the most magnificent sights, ate exotic foods, and immersed themselves in cultures they'd only ever read about. Though they knew their time together was limited, they were grateful for every moment they shared and every experience they had.

As they sat together, watching the sunset over the ocean on the final evening of their trip, Sara turned to her husband and said, "We've still got time. Not enough, but enough." And they hugged each other tightly, grateful for the memories they'd made and the fact that they'd lived life on their own terms.
