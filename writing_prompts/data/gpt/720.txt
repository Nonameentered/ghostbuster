You are sent back in time to the year 1909 to kill a man who will invent a virus that renders the human race infertile. All you know is that he's a Jewish boy living in Europe. You name is Adolf Hitler.
I am Adolf Hitler, and I have a mission. I have been sent back in time to the year 1909, tasked with killing a Jewish boy who will later create a virus to render the human race infertile. I do not know this boy's name or where he lives, only that he resides in Europe.

As I make my way across the continent, I am struck by the beauty of the old world. The buildings are grand and ornate, the people dressed in their finest clothes. I cannot let myself be distracted, however. I must find this boy and eliminate him before he can cause any harm.

Finally, after weeks of searching, I come across a small Jewish community in Poland. I ask around, trying to gather any information about the boy. It is not long before I am directed to a young man named Abraham Stern. He is only sixteen years old, but according to my sources, he is already a brilliant scientist.

I know what I must do, but I find myself hesitating. This boy is not yet a threat, and he is so young. Perhaps he can be persuaded to use his intellect for good, to help his people in their struggles. But then I remember my mission and the dire consequences of not completing it. I take a deep breath and begin to plan.

I watch Abraham for days, observing his routines and movements. He seems like a normal boy, playing with his siblings, studying, and attending synagogue. I realize that I will have to get close to him to carry out my mission. So I disguise myself as a Jewish merchant and approach him in the market.

We strike up a conversation, and Abraham seems friendly enough. I offer to buy him lunch, and he agrees. As we sit and eat, I try to see if he is the type of person who could create something so deadly. He talks about his love for science, his passion for learning. I nod along, wishing that things could be different for him. But they can't.

As we finish our meal, I glance around, ensuring that no one is watching. I stand up and pull out my pistol. Abraham's eyes widen in fear as he realizes what is happening. I hesitate for a moment before pulling the trigger. The shot echoes through the market, and I quickly slip away, leaving Abraham's lifeless body behind.

I return to my own time, feeling both relieved and troubled. I have completed my mission, but at what cost? Despite my beliefs, I have taken an innocent life. And who is to say that my actions have truly prevented the virus from being created?

As I sit alone in my chambers, I am left with the weight of my actions and the knowledge that history is a fragile thing. One small change can ripple through time and alter the course of everything.
