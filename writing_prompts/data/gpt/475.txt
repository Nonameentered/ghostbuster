I remember the day I found out magic wasn't real. It was a sunny day and my friends and I were playing tag in the park. Suddenly, a butterfly fluttered by and I exclaimed, "Watch this!" as I tried to make it disappear with a wave of my hand. But nothing happened. My friends laughed and one of them said, "You know magic isn't real, right?" I was shocked. I had always believed in magic and thought that anything was possible with a little bit of hocus pocus.

As I walked home that day, I felt a sense of disappointment and sadness. But as I grew older, I realized that even though magic may not be real, there are still many amazing things in this world that can spark wonder and joy. Sunsets, the smile of a loved one, or the feeling of accomplishing something great - those are the things that truly matter. And in a way, they are even more magical than any disappearing act could ever be.
