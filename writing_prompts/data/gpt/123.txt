I walked back to my cubicle after a long lunch break to find that my stapler had mysteriously disappeared. I looked around to see if anyone took it, but the cubicle was deserted.

I felt a pang of irritation - this was definitely a prank. A quick glance out of the window confirmed my suspicions. I saw a group of colleagues outside, giggling and pointing towards my cubicle. I could see one of them holding something that resembled my stapler.

I decided to go outside and confront them. I approached them, trying to maintain an air of calmness. "Did you guys take my stapler?" I asked, hiding any undertones of anger.

There was a brief silence until one of my colleagues, Ashley spoke up. "We just wanted to prank you a little. It's just a stapler."

I was relieved to find that my stapler was okay, but I still felt disrespected. "It's not funny at all. Give it back to me. Please," I said, trying to mask my annoyance.

They handed me my stapler, and I made my way back to my cubicle. As I sat down at my desk, I realized that this was not the first time they had pulled a prank on me. They had been doing it for the past few months, and it was getting old.

I decided that I wasn't going to let them take advantage of me again. I came up with a plan to get them back. I bought a bag of candy and left it on Ashley's desk with a note that read, "Thanks for the prank. Enjoy the candy."

The next day, Ashley came into the office, expecting to find a sweet treat waiting for her. Instead, she found a box full of a thousand staples with a note that read, "Now you'll be prepared for your next prank."

The group was stunned as they realized what had happened. I had finally fought back, and they knew they could not mess with me from that day forward.

Looking back on the incident, I can still remember how annoyed I was that they took my stapler. But I'm glad it happened because it helped me grow a backbone. I also learned to stand up for myself and face challenges head-on.

Now, every time I encounter a problem at work or in my personal life, I always remember the day someone took my stapler. Because that day taught me to be assertive, take care of myself, and face things directly, no matter how small they may be.
