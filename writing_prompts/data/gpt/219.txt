My parents had always talked about having another child, but I never thought it would actually happen. So when my baby sister was born, I was elated.

At first, everything seemed normal. I would help my parents with feeding and changing her, and she would smile and coo like any other baby. But as time went on, things started to get weird.

My sister wasn't growing like she should be. She stayed the size of a baby, even as I grew taller and started middle school. My parents tried to explain it as a medical condition, but I knew something wasn't right.

As I got older, I started to resent my sister. I was jealous of the attention she got and frustrated that she never matured like I did. But despite all of that, I still loved her.

Now, as an adult, my sister is still the same size, but I've grown to accept it. We have a unique bond, and I wouldn't trade it for anything. Life growing up with a sister who never ages was certainly challenging, but it also taught me to appreciate the little things and never take anything for granted.
