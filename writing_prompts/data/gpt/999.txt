Your right eye can see the last sin someone has committed only when your left eye is closed, and you find yourself in a family gathering. How does the day go?
As I arrived at my aunt's house, I couldn't help but feel a sense of dread wash over me. Family gatherings were never my thing, and as an introverted person, I always felt out of place amongst the ecstatic crowd. But today, I had more pressing matters on my mind. You see, I have a unique gift that I never chose to have. My right eye can see the last sin someone has committed only when my left eye is closed. And it never fails to remind me of the darkness that lies within human hearts.

I tried to shake off the feeling and walked into the house, greeting my aunt and her family. Laughter and chatter filled the air, and the aroma of freshly cooked food wafted through the room. I smiled and joined the rest of my family, hoping to blend in and go unnoticed. I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was wrong. Something wasn't right.

That feeling only intensified as I looked around the room. My right eye flickered to the left, and I saw a vibrant aura of red around some people. That was the color I usually saw when my gift kicked in. The color that represented sin. The familial gathering was always a hotbed of emotion and secrets, and I couldn't help but wonder what kind of skeletons they were hiding in their closets.

I closed my left eye to get a better view of my surroundings, and my right eye began to glow. The first person I laid my eyes on was my uncle. Contrary to the jovial exterior he had put up moments before, I saw the red hue around him. I couldn't make out the sin, but it was there. The aura's intensity increased and wrapped around him like a vice, signaling that it was not just a small mistake.

I turned my gaze elsewhere, hoping to find something else to focus on. Instead, I saw my mother's aura, darker, but not nearly as intense as my uncle's. She had a degree of guilt about something she had done recently, but I couldn't tell what it was.

My heart beat faster as I continued to scan the room, seeing more and more red auras around each of my family members. I couldn't stand it anymore and closed my right eye, taking a deep breath to calm down.

For a while, I lost myself in my thoughts, thinking about how differently people acted when they had something to hide. I felt out of place as if I didn't belong there, and the truth was, I didn't. I never have, and I never will. But when I closed my left eye again and glanced around the room, I saw something new: a faint shimmer of white.

It was coming from my little cousin, Lily, who was sitting alone in the far corner of the room. She was only ten, and we didn't talk much, but I remembered that she was always quiet and reserved.

I blinked, and the shimmer turned into a bright golden glow. I couldn't believe what I was seeing, but it was there, in front of me. My left eye open, a golden aura around a little girl that I barely knew.

I closed my eye again, trying to make sense of it all.

What is the sin?

Why was it golden?

My thoughts were interrupted by my aunt, who called out to me. "What are you doing, dear? Come join us for dinner."

I forced a smile, feeling like a fraud as I walked over to join them. I wasn't sure what was happening to Lily, but I knew that we needed to be careful around her. I grabbed my plate and found an empty seat at the table, joining in the conversation.

As we ate, I couldn't help but notice the tension in the air. It was a stark contrast to the laughter and chatter of before, and I wondered if they were feeling what I was. As if they were all waiting for something to happen.

After dinner, my aunt called out to us, saying it was time to have a group photo. We all gathered around and smiled, posing for the camera. I stood at the edge of the group, trying to make myself as inconspicuous as possible.

But the second the camera clicked, my aunt yelped, making us all turn around to see what was wrong. We saw Lily, surrounded by a bright, golden light. It almost looked like she was radiating sunshine.

As everyone else in the room asked Lily what was happening, I couldn't help but feel like I was finally getting an answer to my questions. I sat back and observed, watching everything unfold.

"Lily, what's wrong? Why are you glowing?" asked my aunt.

"I don't know," she replied, looking down at herself. "I just feel happy."

I closed my left eye again, trying to see if anything had changed. But the golden aura was still present, growing brighter by the second.

"Lily, can you come over here?" I asked.

She nodded and ran over, sitting next to me. I closed my left eye and looked at her, and even with my right eye open, I couldn't see any sin around her.

"Shh, I can see it too," she whispered, giving me a knowing smile.

"What is it? Why are you glowing?"

"I don't know," she replied, still grinning. "But it's really bright, isn't it?"

It was. The golden aura that surrounded her was brighter than anything I had ever seen before. It was as if a ray of sunshine had latched onto her and refused to let go.

We spent the rest of the evening experimenting with Lily's aura, trying to see if we could figure out what it was. But we couldn't. It was unlike anything I had seen before, and it left me with more questions than answers.

As the night wore on, my family began to leave, and I was left alone with my aunt and c. We spoke for a while, reminiscing about the good times, and as I was getting ready to leave, my aunt pulled me aside.

"Can I ask you something?" she said, eyeing me suspiciously.

I nodded.

"Did you see something weird today? Like, around Lily?"

I hesitated for a moment before nodding.

"Yes, I did. But I'm not sure if it's anything to worry about."

She took a deep breath, as if steeling herself for something.

"Lily's been having nightmares, recently. She won't say what they're about, but they're so bad that we can't wake her up. We've been worried about her for a while now, but we didn't know what to do."

I thought about it for a moment, considering my options.

"If you want, I can stay and talk to her. Maybe I can help."

My aunt nodded, grateful.

"Thank you. That would mean a lot."

I stayed late that night, speaking to Lily about anything and everything, trying to get to the bottom of her nightmares. And even with my left eye firmly closed, I couldn't see anything but that golden aura around her.

As I left their house that night, I couldn't shake off the feeling that our encounter would change everything. That maybe, just maybe, Lily's golden aura represented something more significant than just a happy feeling. Only time would tell.
