Your girlfriend has always hated you, and is constantly making attempts to ruin your life. However, everything she does inadvertently makes your life better. Today, ever oblivious, you propose to her.
For as long as I could remember, my girlfriend, Sarah, has always hated me. She is always finding ways to ruin every little aspect of my life. She has caused me to lose jobs, friends, and even my apartment. For some reason, every time she tried to sabotage my life, it always backfired. 

As time went on, I noticed that every time she tried to hurt me, my life would improve. I got better jobs, met new friends, and even found my dream house. It was strange yet comforting in a way. 

Today, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I planned a special evening for Sarah, got down on one knee, and proposed to her. To my surprise, she said yes! 

I thought to myself, maybe all of her ill-will towards me was because she secretly loved me. As we embraced one another, I swear I heard her whisper "finally, I can stop trying to ruin your life."

Regardless of her true intentions, I am happy to have Sarah by my side. From this day forward, I know that she is with me to make me better, even if it's unintentional.
