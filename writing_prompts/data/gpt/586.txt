A person walks into an elevator, alone, that has a vacuum cleaner left in it. Any genre.
Jane had no idea what to expect as she stepped into the elevator. Expecting it to be empty, she was surprised to find a vacuum cleaner lying in the corner- abandoned, alone. A strange feeling crept into her mind like a snake, whispering that something wasn't right. Suddenly the door snapped shut, trapping her in the elevator.

There was no way out, and the vacuum cleaner was her only company. The lights flickered and in that brief darkness she glimpsed something moving inside its tubes. Something tiny and black that might have been insects. The hairs on the back of her neck stood up as she felt them crawl across her skin. She shook her hand, trying to free herself from an invisible force holding her back.

The doors creaked open then and Jane ran from the elevator, never looking back. In the silence, the vacuum cleaner stood alone, watching her go.
