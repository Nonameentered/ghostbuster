Every night I tell my girlfriend a bedtime story by the end of this one I'd like her to be my fianc√©.
Once upon a time, there was a young man named Jack. Jack was deeply in love with his girlfriend, Lucy. They had been together for many years and their bond was unbreakable. Jack admired everything about Lucy, from her intelligence to her kindness. However, he had one secret wish - he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her as his wife.

One night, as Lucy was getting ready for bed, Jack sat down beside her and said, "I have a story to tell you tonight, my love."

Lucy smiled and snuggled up close to Jack, eager to hear his tale. Jack began his story, "Once upon a time, there was a young man named Jack. Jack was searching for his true love, someone who would be his partner in life and make his world complete. After many heartbreaks, Jack met a kind and beautiful woman named Lucy. She was everything he had ever wanted in a partner and Jack knew that he had found his soulmate."

Lucy giggled and said, "I think I know where this story is going, Jack."

Jack smirked and continued, "But this story isn't about me, Lucy. It's about a boy who was in love with a girl and was waiting for the right time to ask her to be his wife."

Lucy's eyes widened as she realized what Jack was hinting at. "Go on, Jack, I want to hear the rest of the story," she said.

Jack took a deep breath and continued, "The boy knew that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with the girl, but he wanted to make sure that everything was perfect before he popped the question. He wanted to make her feel like she was the most special person in the world and knew that he had to come up with something truly special."

Lucy was transfixed by the story, her heart beating faster as she waited for Jack to get to the point. Jack continued, "The boy decided to take the girl on a grand adventure, filled with excitement, joy, and love. He planned for weeks, ensuring that every detail was perfect. And when the day finally arrived, the boy took the girl's hand and led her on a journey that she would never forget."

Lucy's eyes were now filled with tears as she realized what was happening. Jack took a deep breath and continued, "And as the adventure came to an end, the boy got down on one knee and asked the girl to be his wife. The girl was overcome with joy and said yes, knowing that she had found her one true love."

Jack took a deep breath, his heart pounding in his chest. "Lucy, my love, will you be my wife? Will you spend the rest of our lives together, side by side, through thick and thin?"

Lucy was overcome with emotion. She looked deep into Jack's eyes and saw the love that he had for her. She knew that he was the one she wanted to spend the rest of her life with, and without hesitation, she said yes.

The room was filled with joy and happiness as Jack slid the ring onto Lucy's finger. They embraced each other tightly, knowing that they were meant to be together forever.

From that day on, Jack and Lucy were inseparable. They traveled the world together, experiencing all of its beauty and wonders. They faced challenges and obstacles, but their love for each other never wavered. They grew old together, their love never fading, their bond growing stronger with each passing day.

And as they lay in bed together each night, Jack would look into Lucy's eyes and say, "I love you more than anything in this world. You are my soulmate, my partner in life, my wife."

Lucy would smile and say, "I love you too, my dear. And thank you for that bedtime story all those years ago. It was the best proposal I could have ever asked for."
