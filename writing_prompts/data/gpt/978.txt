Everyone in the world had known for centuries that the color of their eyes would change with their emotions. It was just a fact of life, and everyone had come to accept it. However, there was one person in the world, a young girl named Ellie, who was born without this trait. It was an oddity, and she was immediately mistrusted by many people.

They thought that she was hiding something, that she was trying to deceive them with her unchanging eyes. They didn't understand that she was just like them, she too felt emotions, but there was no outward manifestation of them.

As Ellie grew up, she found it hard to make friends, people were afraid of her. They thought she might be a psychopath or a sociopath, someone who lacked empathy and was unable to feel emotions. But that couldn't have been further from the truth.

Ellie was a compassionate person, who felt deeply. She just couldn't express her emotions in the same way that others did. This made her a target for bullies, who would taunt her and call her names. But Ellie refused to let their words get to her.

Instead, she focused on the things that made her happy, like reading books and spending time with her family. She knew that one day people would see that she was just like them, emotions and all, and that her eyes were just a small part of who she was.
