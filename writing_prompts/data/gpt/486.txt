A long time ago, in ancient India, a ruler was grieving the loss of his son. To distract himself, he called upon his wise men to create a game that could be played with strategy, skill and patience. The game they created was called Chaturanga, and it spawned the game of chess as we know it today.

Chaturanga was played on a special board with specific pieces, each with their own move set. The pieces represented different parts of the army - infantry, cavalry, elephants and chariots, and the king and his advisor. The game was loved by the people and spread across India and into Persia.

As it spread, the game and the pieces changed. The game was simplified and the pieces were made to look like medieval soldiers. The queen, once a weak piece, now became the most powerful and valuable piece on the board. Each piece's movement was now standardized across the board and the game was becoming more universal.

The game spread throughout the world and became a symbol of intelligence and strategy. It was played in royal courts and on street corners. People even started hosting tournaments where great players could compete against one another.

Today, chess remains beloved by millions worldwide. It's a game that has stood the test of time, surviving through countless wars, political upheavals and changes to society. It continues to grow more popular each year, and its origins in India remain an important part of its history.
