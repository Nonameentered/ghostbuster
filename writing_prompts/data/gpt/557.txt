When the news broke out that Canada had started demanding favors from all the countries they had been nice to, the world was shocked. People had always thought Canadians were just inherently nice and kind-hearted. But little did they know, there was a reason behind their niceness.

For decades, Canadian diplomats had been showering foreign officials with gifts, taking them out for dinners, and generally being excessively friendly towards them. But all of this was just part of a sophisticated plan that Canada had been working on for years.

The Canadian government had been keeping a secret ledger of all the favors that other countries owed them, and nobody had even noticed. They had become the masters of the long game, playing an elaborate chess game in the background, while the rest of the world was busy fighting petty wars and competing for power.

And now, as the world faced an unprecedented crisis, Canada decided it was time to cash in all of their IOUs. They started making demands on everything from trade agreements to humanitarian aid.

At first, other countries were taken aback by Canada's demands. After all, they had always been the good guys, the ones who asked for nothing in return for their kindness. But now, they were asking for everything.

Canada was like a friendly neighbor who always lent a helping hand. But when the time came for repayment, they were not shy about asking for what was owed to them.

As the months passed, Canada grew more powerful and influential as their demands were met with compliance and even gratitude. They had played their cards right and had become the ultimate power brokers.

And so, the world learned a valuable lesson. Nobody gives anything for free, no kindness comes without a price. The Canadians had mastered the art of strategic niceness, and now they were reaping the benefits.
