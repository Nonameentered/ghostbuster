Your SuperSuit (TM) is machine washable. Like colors only, mild detergent, tumble dry low. _DO NOT_ iron.
Alice had always dreamed of being a superhero. She filled her childhood bedroom with comic books and action figures, and she spent hours practicing her superhero poses and catchphrases in the mirror.

But it wasn't until she turned 25 that Alice finally got her chance to don a SuperSuit(TM) and become a real-life superhero. She had applied for a top-secret government program that recruited ordinary people to become vigilantes, and after a grueling interview process, Alice was selected to join the team.

The SuperSuit(TM) was unlike anything Alice had ever seen before. Made from a high-tech fabric that looked and felt like body armor, it was equipped with all sorts of gadgets and gizmos, from retractable wings to laser beams. But what impressed Alice the most was its durability. According to the instruction manual, the SuperSuit(TM) was machine washable. Like colors only, mild detergent, tumble dry low. _DO NOT_ iron.

At first, Alice was skeptical. How could a suit this advanced be thrown in the wash like a pair of jeans? But after her first few missions, she quickly realized the value of a machine washable SuperSuit(TM). Fighting crime was messy business, and her suit was often covered in blood, dirt, and who knows what else. But after every mission, she simply tossed it in the laundry basket and washed it like any other piece of clothing.

Alice became known as the "Clean Hero" among her team. Her colleagues often joked that her SuperSuit(TM) was even more powerful in the wash than on the battlefield. But Alice didn't mind the teasing. She was proud of her suit, and she took care of it like it was her own child.

One day, after a particularly grueling mission, Alice found herself sitting alone in the laundry room, staring at her SuperSuit(TM) as it tumbled around in the dryer. She couldn't help but think about the previous night's battle, and the close call she had had with a group of armed robbers.

As she sat there, lost in thought, Alice suddenly heard a noise behind her. She spun around, SuperSuit(TM) at the ready, but saw nothing out of the ordinary. She shook her head, chalking it up to paranoia, and turned back to the dryer.

But just as she reached for the handle, she felt a cold, sharp blade pressed against the back of her neck.

"Don't move," a voice said behind her. "Or I'll slice your throat."

Alice's heart raced as she realized she had been caught off guard. She slowly raised her hands, her mind racing with possible escape plans. But as she looked around, she saw that she was completely trapped. The laundry room was a small, windowless space, with only two exits. And the figure behind her was large and muscular, with an eerie calmness about him.

"What do you want?" Alice said, trying to sound brave.

"I want your SuperSuit(TM)," the man said, pressing the blade deeper into Alice's skin. "And I want you to tell me how to get one of my own."

Alice's mind raced as she realized what was happening. This man was a criminal, and he was after the technology behind her SuperSuit(TM). If he got his hands on it, who knew what damage he could do?

But Alice wasn't one to give up easily. She took a deep breath, steadied herself, and launched into action. With lightning speed, she spun around, grabbed the man's knife hand, and twisted it until he cried out in pain. Then, before he could react, she kicked him in the chest, sending him flying across the room.

But the man was quick, and he sprang back to his feet in a matter of seconds. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small, silver device that Alice recognized as a detonator.

"Stop, or I'll blow us both to hell," he said, holding the device up for Alice to see.

Alice froze. She knew that the device could be deadly, and she didn't want to take any chances. But at the same time, she couldn't let this man get away with her SuperSuit(TM). She had to think fast.

And that's when she remembered the instruction manual. The one that had told her the SuperSuit(TM) was machine washable. Like colors only, mild detergent, tumble dry low. _DO NOT_ iron.

With a smile on her face, Alice lunged forward, grabbed the man's wrist, and twisted it until he dropped the detonator. Then, with all her strength, she tackled him to the ground and pinned him there.

"You're not getting away with this," she said, holding the man's arms behind his back.

The man struggled, but he was no match for Alice and her SuperSuit(TM). She held him there until the government agents arrived, and he was taken away in handcuffs.

As Alice emerged from the laundry room, victorious, she realized that her SuperSuit(TM) had truly saved her life. Without its durability and strength, she might not have been able to defeat the criminal. And without its machine washability, she might not have been able to get rid of the evidence.

Alice smiled to herself as she walked back to her team's headquarters, her mission accomplished. She knew that she had found her calling as a superhero, and she was proud to wear her SuperSuit(TM) every day.

And who knows? Maybe someday, she would even get a chance to wash it. Like colors only, mild detergent, tumble dry low. _DO NOT_ iron.
