At age 15 you told the gf you were 'in love' with that you'd always be there when she was in need. Aphrodite heard you and made it a reality, whenever your gf was in need you appear at her side. Problem is, you and the girl broke up after 3 weeks but you still appear even now..10 years later
As a young boy, I remember being enamored by love stories and fairytales. I used to dream of finding my one true love and living happily ever after. So when I met Maria, I thought she was the one. It was the summer of 2008, and I was just fifteen years old.

Maria was everything I ever wanted. She was smart, funny, beautiful, and confident. I was smitten by her, and I knew I had to make her mine. So, I mustered up the courage to confess my love to her. I told her that I would always be there for her whenever she needed me.

That day changed the course of my life. Aphrodite, the goddess of love, heard my words and made it a reality. The very next day, Maria was in desperate need of math help, and I was there by her side without even knowing about it. From that day on, anytime Maria needed me, I would appear by her side.

At first, it was exciting to be able to help my crush whenever she needed me. But as time went on, it became a burden. I couldn't control when or how I would appear, and it wasn't just for Maria anymore. I would pop up in front of strangers, friends, and even my parents, whenever someone needed help.

Despite the burden, I always considered it a small sacrifice to make for the girl I loved. So, when Maria and I broke up after three weeks of dating, I expected the appearances to stop. But they didn't. Every time Maria needed me, I would still appear by her side.

At first, Maria was grateful for my appearances. I would help her with her school work, take care of her when she was sick, and even show up on her birthday as a surprise. But as she started dating other people, she began to realize how weird it was for her ex-boyfriend to appear out of nowhere every time she needed help.

We had a massive fight about it one day, and that was when I realized that I was stuck. I couldn't control when or how I would appear, and I couldn't even explain to Maria why I was still by her side despite our breakup.

Years went by, and I learned to live with the curse. I would appear randomly and help whoever needed me. Sometimes it was a small act of kindness, like helping someone pick up their groceries. Other times it was more significant, like saving someone from a car accident.

I became known as the mysterious helper to people around me, and I even ended up using my power for good. I would use my appearances to help people in need, doing whatever I could to make the world a better place.

Fast forward ten years, and I'm still appearing. It's become a part of who I am, and while it's still frustrating at times, I've learned to live with it. I've started to see it as a gift, a chance to make a difference in the world.

As for Maria, I still appear whenever she needs me. But over the years, our relationship has evolved into a friendship, and she's even grown to appreciate my appearances. She jokes that I'm her own personal guardian angel, and I can't help but laugh at the irony.

Looking back, I realize that my love for Maria may have been the catalyst for my curse, but it was also the reason I've been able to help so many people. And for that, I can't help but feel grateful.
