Sophie sat at her kitchen table, staring at her phone. She didn't know who else to ask. She needed advice, but she didn't want her friends or family to know what was going on. They would judge her, or worse, worry about her.

She scrolled through her contacts, racking her brain for someone trustworthy and non-judgmental. That's when she saw the name "Tom" and breathed a sigh of relief. They had been friends for years, and she knew he was always there for her.

Without hesitation, she hit the call button, her heart rate quickening as she waited for him to answer. He picked up on the fourth ring, and she launched into her story.

"I don't know who else to talk to," she said, her voice shaking. "I need your help."

Tom listened patiently as Sophie explained her predicament. She had been laid off from her job a few months ago, and was struggling to make ends meet. She had applied for dozens of jobs, but hadn't heard back from anyone. She was behind on rent and bills, and didn't know how she was going to survive.

Tom listened quietly, nodding as she spoke. When she finished, he said, "I'm so sorry you're going through this. But you don't have to do it alone. I'm here for you, always. And I have an idea that might help."

Sophie felt a wave of relief wash over her. She knew she could count on Tom to be there for her, and his offer of help meant the world to her.

Over the next few weeks, Tom helped Sophie get back on her feet. He offered to loan her some money to cover her bills, and helped her update her resume and apply for jobs. She eventually landed a great position, and was able to pay Tom back with interest.

Sophie realized that sometimes, you don't know who else to ask for help. But if you have even one true friend like Tom, you don't have to face the world alone.
