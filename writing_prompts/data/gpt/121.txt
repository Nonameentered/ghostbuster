- 'You either die a hero...'
"You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain."

Those were the words that echoed in Max's head as he lay on the ground. He had always been a hero, fighting for justice and saving lives. But today, as he looked up at the scene around him, he realized that he had become the villain.

It had started with good intentions. Max had been fighting against corrupt politicians and businesses for years, trying to make a difference in the world. But as he gained more power and influence, he found himself making compromises. He started doing things he never thought he would, all in the name of progress.

And now, it had all come crashing down. Max had been caught in the act of embezzlement, using his position of authority to siphon off money from the very causes he claimed to be fighting for. The headlines would be brutal, and the public outrage even worse.

As he lay there, Max thought back on all the good he had done. He had saved countless lives, brought down powerful criminals, and made the world a better place. But now, all of that was tainted. None of it would matter in the face of his crimes.

Max knew what he had to do. He couldn't live with the shame and guilt of what he had become. He had to die a hero, no matter how painful it might be.

He turned to the police officer standing over him and spoke softly. "Tell the world what I've done. Make sure they know the truth."

The officer looked down at Max, surprised. "Why would you want me to do that?"

Max closed his eyes and sighed. "Because it's the right thing to do. You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain. And I refuse to let that happen."

With those words, Max closed his eyes and took his last breath. He knew that the world would never forgive him for what he had done, but at least he could die knowing that he had tried to make things right.

As the officer radioed for backup, Max's words rang in his head. He realized that the true hero was the man he had just arrested, the man who had chosen to die rather than live as a villain. And he knew that he would never forget that lesson.
