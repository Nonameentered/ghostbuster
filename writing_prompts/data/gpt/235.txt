I was sitting in my room, scrolling through various writing prompts for inspiration, when I felt a heavy hand on my shoulder. Startled, I turned around to come face to face with the Devil himself. My heart raced as I tried to comprehend the situation.

"Look, we need to talk about you putting me in every Writing Prompt," the Devil said, shaking his head.

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Was this some sort of trick? "What do you mean?" I asked, the words barely audible as I tried to keep my composure.

"You know exactly what I mean," the Devil replied, his voice low and menacing. "Every time you write a prompt, you include me. You make me out to be some sort of villain, and frankly, it's quite insulting."

I swallowed hard, feeling guilty for the way I had been portraying the Devil in my writing. "I'm sorry," I said, feeling the weight of my words. "I didn't realize it was such a big deal."

"It is a big deal," the Devil replied, crossing his arms in front of his chest. "You're perpetuating stereotypes and promoting negative images of me. It's not fair."

I nodded, understanding his perspective. "You're right," I said. "I'll make a conscious effort to be more fair in my writing from now on."

The Devil nodded, seeming to accept my apology. "Good," he said. "Just remember that I'm not always the bad guy. There are plenty of positive stories you could write involving me."

With that, the Devil disappeared, leaving me to ponder our conversation. I realized that I had been guilty of perpetuating negative images of the Devil and that it was time for me to change my ways. From now on, I would look for more positive stories to write about this intriguing character, one of the most fascinating in all of literature.
