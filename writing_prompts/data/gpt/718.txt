Every night before I drift off to sleep, I close my eyes and wait for the swirling patterns to appear. It's almost like watching a kaleidoscope, the colors and shapes moving in tune with each other.

My curiosity about these patterns began as a child. I remember asking my parents if they saw the same thing when they closed their eyes, but they always dismissed my question as being silly. Eventually, as I grew up, I learned to accept that it was just a strange quirk of mine.

One day, however, I decided to investigate further. I read every article and scientific study I could find about these patterns, but the more I read, the more confused I became. Different experts had their own theories, ranging from simple explanations like the retinal cells still being active, to more complex neurological explanations involving the visual cortex in the brain.

To satiate myself, I decided to conduct my own test. Armed with a blindfold and a stopwatch, I laid down in my bed and covered my eyes. I started the stopwatch and waited for patterns to appear. When they did, I took note of the time and duration before they disappeared.

Over the course of a few nights, I gathered enough data to draw a conclusion. It seemed that the patterns appeared around the same time every night, and lasted for roughly the same amount of time. In addition, when I opened my eyes and then closed them again, the patterns would appear again. This led me to believe that they were not caused by the retinal cells, but rather, something more complex.

Feeling more confused than ever, I decided to try something else. Instead of just watching the patterns, I would try to manipulate them. I began to focus on certain colors or shapes, and then wait to see if they would appear in the patterns. Surprisingly, they often did. This made me believe that the patterns were created by my brain in real-time, rather than being caused by any external stimuli.

As I continued to experiment, I began to notice more and more details in the patterns. In addition to the colors and shapes, there were lines and movements. It almost felt like I was watching a miniature world, complete with its own set of rules and physics.

At this point, I realized that the patterns were a form of art produced by my own mind. Just as someone could paint a picture or compose a song, my brain was creating its own work of art. It was a beautiful and intricate work, one that only I could ever see.

As I pondered this realization, I began to feel a deep sense of gratitude. In a world that can often feel cold and cruel, I was blessed with my own personal art gallery. No matter what happened in my life, I could always retreat to this private space and lose myself in the patterns.

In the end, the patterns behind our eyelids may forever remain a mystery. But for me, they will always be a reminder to appreciate the beauty that exists within ourselves, and to continue exploring the mysteries of our minds.
