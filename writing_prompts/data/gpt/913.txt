Joey always knew that he was different from the rest of the world. While everyone else experienced days that lasted for an overall 24 hours, his days lasted for an extra hour. He wasn't sure why it happened, but it made him feel both special and alone at the same time. 

Joey woke up every morning at his usual time, 6:00 am. However, his day didn't end until 7:00 am the following day. This meant that he had one extra hour to spend each day, which he usually used by catching up on everything he had missed during the day. He spent this hour napping, working out, or just enjoying the silence and stillness of the world around him. 

But the most fascinating part of Joey's day was the hour when the world stopped except for him. It was as if Joey was the only living thing in the entire world for that hour. The birds wouldn't chirp, the wind wouldn't blow, and time would stand still as Joey lived his life in a vacuum. 

Joey wondered if anyone else on the planet had this same experience. Maybe there was someone out there who, like him, experienced an extra hour in their day. It seemed unlikely, but it still made him feel less alone. 

One day, as Joey lay in bed waiting for the world to stop, he realized that he had never tried to leave his house during that hour. He had always just stayed inside, too scared to venture out into the world alone. 

But today was different. Joey was feeling brave, and he wanted to see what would happen if he left his house during that hour. He quickly got dressed, grabbed his keys and phone, and stepped outside. 

Everything around him was almost surreal. The cars were frozen in place, the trees didn't rustle, and there was nobody on the streets. It was only Joey who was moving forward, as if he were walking through thick mud. 

Joey wandered around the block for a while, taking in everything that was happening around him. It was a strange but fascinating experience. However, something even stranger happened when he entered the park. 

As soon as he took his first steps into the quiet, serene park, he saw her. She was standing there, frozen in time just like everything else, except for her eyes. They were staring at him, as if they could see him, even though he knew he was the only one who was moving. 

It gave him goosebumps, but he tried to keep his cool as he took a step closer to her. "Who are you?" he asked her, even though he knew that he wouldn't get an answer. 

She didn't answer, of course, but that was when Joey caught sight of her necklace. It was a simple golden pendant that hung around her neck, and it glinted in the sunlight that was frozen in the sky. Suddenly Joey knew what he had to do. 

He gently lifted the necklace from the woman's frozen body and quietly walked back to his house. Once he got back inside, Joey put the necklace on his table, opened his laptop, and began to search for information about it on the internet. 

He scrolled deep into Google and finally found something. The necklace had belonged to a woman named Sarah, who had gone missing years ago. According to the article, Sarah had been a scientist working on a time machine. She had been close to her breakthrough when she disappeared without a trace. Her colleagues said that she had been acting strangely in the weeks leading up to her disappearance. 

Suddenly Joey realized what he had done. He had taken possession of Sarah's time machine, and he was the only one who could use it. 

Joey looked at the clock and saw that he only had ten minutes before everything would start moving again. He grabbed the necklace, put it around his neck, and ran to his front door. When he opened it, he was shocked to see that the world hadn't started moving yet. He had more time than he thought. 

He took a deep breath, stepped outside, and pressed the pendant on the necklace. Suddenly, time stopped again, and Joey was left standing in an empty world. However, this time it was different. This time Joey was ready to use the time machine. 

For the first time in his life, Joey's extra hour had some meaning. It wasn't just an hour that he spent napping or working out anymore. Now it was something that he could use to change the world, to go back in time, and to find the woman who had worked so hard to create this machine. 

The machine hummed softly as Joey stepped inside. He set the parameters and pushed the button, not knowing what would happen next. The world around him began to swirl and twirl, and Joey felt as if he was in a giant tornado. He held onto the railing tightly, not knowing if he would ever need to use the machine again. 

After what felt like hours, the machine slowed down and eventually came to a stop. Joey stepped outside, into a world that was completely different from the one he had left. He had gone back in time, and he had saved Sarah from her own creation. 

From that day forward, Joey's extra hour wasn't just a burden anymore. It was a gift, one that he was determined to use in the best way possible. He spent his life trying to make a difference with his extra hour, and he knew that he had made a difference in the world just by having it.
