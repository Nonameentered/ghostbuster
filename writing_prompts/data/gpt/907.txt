I closed my eyes and took one final, deep breath. As I exhaled, I felt my body grow still, and I knew that my time on Earth was over. But as I opened my eyes again, I found myself standing in a place I'd never seen before.

It was a bright, open expanse, filled with sunlight and a warm breeze that played over my skin. Looking down, I realized that I was no longer in my old body - instead, I was young and strong, just as I had been at forty years old. And as I watched, I felt a strange sensation, almost as though time were moving in reverse.

And that's when I heard it - a voice, in my ear, explaining where I was and what was happening to me. It told me that in the afterlife, there was no aging forward - instead, I would age backward, starting from my current age and slowly regressing until I reached zero, at which point I would be reincarnated into a new life.

Over the years - or was it centuries? - I followed this path, feeling my body grow younger and stronger even as my memories slowly began to fade. I remembered my parents, my childhood, my first jobs and loves... but each day, it became harder to hold onto those memories, and I found myself forgetting more and more about the life I had once lived.

It was strange, but it was also peaceful. As I grew younger, I felt a sense of vitality I hadn't known in years, and I found myself exploring this strange new world with a sense of joy and curiosity. I met others along the way, all of whom were at different points in their journey, and we talked and laughed together, enjoying each other's company even as we slowly faded away.

It was a long journey, but it eventually came to an end. As I grew younger and younger, I could feel the emptiness in my mind growing, and I knew that soon, I would be reborn. And then, one day, I was gone - vanished into the void, free to start a new life in a new time, with no knowledge or memory of who I had once been.

For a brief moment, the thought terrified me - who would I be, in this new life? What would I do, where would I go? But then, I thought back to the journey I had just taken, and the sense of peace and curiosity I had felt along the way.

And I knew that, though I might be starting anew, I would never really be alone. Whoever I was in this new life, I would be joined by countless others, all of whom were taking the same journey I had just completed. And together, we would explore this strange, beautiful world once again.
