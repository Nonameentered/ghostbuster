I never thought that my quest for orthodontic freedom would lead me to save the world. I was just a 17-year-old teenager during the zombie apocalypse, but I had a mission. I was tired of having braces, and I needed them off, or they'd be stuck on forever. The tooth doctor I had been seeing had turned into a zombie, so I had to find a new orthodontist.

As I wandered through the deserted city, I stumbled upon a zombie swarm. Instead of running away like a usual person, I saw an opportunity. I swung my backpack full of books and supplies and used it to knock away the zombies. I made my way through the swarm, and by luck, I found a group of survivors who were fighting for their lives.

They had been cornered and were running out of ammo when I showed up. My backpack came in handy again, and it allowed us to take down the zombies. One of the survivors turned out to be a retired orthodontist. After seeing how brave I was, he agreed to remove my braces. 

After my braces were removed, I continued to help the survivors fight the zombies. Together, we developed a plan to destroy the source of the outbreak, and we succeeded. We had saved the world, and I'll always see the memory of my braces getting removed and saving the world as my unlikely superpower.
