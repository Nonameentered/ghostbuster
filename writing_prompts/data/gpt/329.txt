You are a detective who can read minds. But the person you are questioning doesn't have any thoughts despite carrying on a conversation. You suspect something unnatural about him.
Detective John Brady was known for his unique ability to read minds. He had solved many cases by using this skill to get the truth out of suspects. However, this time, he faced a challenge he had never encountered before.

John was in the interrogation room, questioning a suspect named David. David was a tall, well-built man in his early thirties. He was accused of murdering a woman in her apartment. John had put on his headphones, which filtered out the noise in the room, allowing him to concentrate on reading David's mind.

To his surprise, he found that David's mind was completely silent. It was as if his mind was a blank slate, with no thoughts at all. John had never seen this before. He tried again, focusing harder this time, but still nothing came through.

"David, why is your mind silent?" John asked, taking off his headphones.

David looked at John with a blank expression. "What do you mean, Detective?"

"Well, I mean," John started, frustrated. "Normally, I can read people's thoughts, but your mind is completely blank. There's nothing there."

David shrugged. "I don't know what to tell you, Detective. I'm just a normal guy. I have nothing to hide."

John knew that something didn't feel right. He had stopped questioning David for a moment and looked at him closely. His expression was unwavering, never twitching, never nervous. It was almost as if he had no emotions. This only made John more suspicious.

"David, I'm going to ask you again. What were you doing on the night of the murder?" John leaned over the table, examining David's face closely.

"I told you, Detective. I was at home alone. All night." David's expression never changed.

John realized that he was getting nowhere. He couldn't read David's mind, and he couldn't tell from his expression whether he was lying or telling the truth.

"Okay, David. You are free to go. But I'm warning you, this case is not closed yet. If we find evidence connecting you to the murder, I will have no choice but to arrest you."

David got up from the chair and walked out of the interrogation room without another word.

As he watched David leave, John felt a cold sense of unease wash over him. He knew that there was something unnatural about David. His blank mind and emotionless face were not normal. John needed to find out what it was.

John decided to do some digging into David's past. He visited his house and spoke to his neighbors. He found out that David had no family or friends, and he had lived alone for years. John also discovered that David had a strange habit of standing outside at night, staring at the sky for hours on end.

John's intuition told him that this was important, so he followed David one night. What he found was startling.

David was standing in a field, surrounded by a group of other men and women. They were all dressed in black robes and were chanting in a language John had never heard before. David was holding a small, black box.

John hid behind some bushes, watching them closely. Suddenly, there was a bright flash of light, and John heard a deafening roar. He watched as David opened the box, revealing a small, glowing orb inside. The people around him were screaming and writhing on the ground in agony.

John had no idea what was going on, but he knew he needed to act fast. He ran towards the group, yelling at them to stop. David saw him and turned to face him, his expression still blank.

"Stop what you're doing right now!" John yelled at David.

David looked at him for a moment and then spoke in a voice that was not his own. "You shouldn't have come here, Detective. You have no idea what you're dealing with."

Suddenly, John was surrounded by a bright light, and he felt his mind being invaded. Every thought, every memory, every feeling was taken from him, leaving him in a state of shock.

When John came to, he was lying in the middle of the field. The group, including David, was gone, and the black box and orb were nowhere to be found.

John realized that he had stumbled upon something far more dangerous than a murder case. Something he could never have imagined. He knew that he couldn't keep this to himself. He needed to gather a team of people to help him uncover the truth and stop this evil before it was too late.
