For years, Archie had been torn between Betty and Veronica. He liked them both for different reasons, and he couldn't decide which one he wanted to be with. He had dated them both on and off, but he never committed to either one of them. It was like he was waiting for something to happen, but nothing ever did. 

One day, Archie had had enough of his indecisiveness, and he made up his mind. He was going to choose one of them and settle down. He knew it was time to move on and leave his player days behind. 

He sat down and thought about what he truly wanted in a partner. Betty was kind, supportive, and always had his back. She was the girl next door who was always there for him through thick and thin. On the other hand, Veronica was exciting, adventurous, and always up for a good time. She challenged him and made him push his limits. 

In the end, Archie realized that he didn't have to choose between them. He loved them both in their own unique ways, but he knew that he could only be with one of them. After much deliberation, he decided that he wanted to be with Betty. 

He called her up and asked her to meet him at Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe, the same place they used to hang out when they were kids. When she got there, he nervously opened up to her about his feelings. 

"Betty, I know I've been leading you on for a while now, and I'm sorry. But I've realized that out of all the girls I've ever dated, you're the only one who's been there for me through everything. You know me inside out, and you love me for who I am. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Will you be my girlfriend?" 

Betty was overjoyed, and she hugged him tightly. "Of course, Archie. I love you too." 

For Archie, it was like a weight had been lifted off his shoulders. He had finally made a decision and was ready to embrace the next chapter of his life. He had found his soulmate, and he knew he would always love her.
