She looked in the mirror and saw a stranger staring back at her. It had been years since she recognized the person she had become. The years had taken a toll on her and the stress had left marks on her face, turning her once bright eyes into dull pools of sadness.

She sighed, adjusting her clothing before heading out the door. It was time to put on a brave face and head to her friend's wedding. As she made her way to the ceremony, she couldn't help but reflect on how much things had changed since her youth. 

Back then, she was carefree and full of dreams. She believed the sky was the limit, and nothing could hold her back. She had traveled the world, met amazing people, and had endless possibilities for her future. Now, she struggled to find joy in anything, afraid of what the future held.

The wedding was beautiful, as expected, but she couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness as she watched her friend and her new spouse dance the night away. As the reception came to a close, she headed to her car and looked in the mirror once again. 

This time, she saw more than just a stranger. She saw a person who had experienced love, loss, and endless heartache. But, more importantly, she saw someone who was still standing. Someone who was still pushing forward, despite the obstacles that had been thrown her way. 

She smiled, realizing that maybe the reflection staring back at her wasn't a stranger after all. Maybe it was simply a new version of herself, and that was something to be proud of.
