A kid tries to talk the monster under the bed into attacking the monster in the closet.
Johnny was a brave seven-year-old boy. He didn't believe in monsters under the bed or in the closet, but his little sister, Lily, was scared of them. Every night, she insisted on checking under the bed and in the closet before going to sleep. Johnny always played along, and they would laugh at how silly it was.

One night, Johnny had an idea. He crept out of bed and crawled under it, pretending to be scared. He started whispering, "Monster, are you there? I need to talk to you."

To his surprise, a deep voice answered, "Yes, I am here. Who are you?"

"I'm Johnny, and I'm here to talk to you about something important," Johnny replied.

"What is it that you want to talk about?" the monster asked.

"I think you should attack the monster in the closet," Johnny said, trying to sound convincing.

"Why should I do that?" the monster asked.

"Because the monster in the closet is always picking on my little sister. She's scared to sleep because she thinks the closet monster is going to get her."

The monster under the bed was quiet for a moment, pondering Johnny's words. "You make a good point, Johnny. I will think about what you said."

Johnny went back to his bed feeling clever. He knew that monsters weren't real, but he loved making up stories about them. He hoped that he could convince Lily to stop being scared of them.

The next night, Johnny crawled under the bed again and repeated his conversation with the monster. This time, the monster under the bed agreed to attack the monster in the closet.

Johnny grinned to himself, feeling proud of his accomplishment. He told Lily about his conversation with the monster under the bed, hoping she would find it funny too. But Lily didn't seem amused.

"Johnny, that's not funny. You're just making things up," Lily said, frowning.

"I'm not making it up! I really talked to the monster under the bed. He's going to help us," Johnny insisted.

Lily shook her head and crawled under the bed to check for herself. When she came back out, she still looked scared. "I don't like it, Johnny. I don't want any monsters to attack each other."

Johnny tried to explain that it was just a silly conversation, but Lily didn't seem to believe him. She was still scared of the monsters under the bed and in the closet.

Johnny felt guilty. He hadn't meant to make his sister more scared. He crawled under the bed again and talked to the monster under the bed once more.

"Sorry, I changed my mind. I don't think it's a good idea to attack the monster in the closet. Let's just leave things the way they are," Johnny said.

The monster under the bed agreed. "I understand, Johnny. I won't do anything to scare your little sister. I promise."

Johnny crawled back into bed and listened to Lily's breathing becoming steady. He felt relieved that his sister was finally asleep. He learned a valuable lesson that scary stories were not always funny.

The next day, Johnny promised Lily that he would never make up scary stories again. Lily smiled and hugged her brother, grateful for his promise.

From then on, Johnny tried his best to be the brave older brother, and Lily became less scared of things that go bump in the night. They both learned that sometimes, the best way to conquer their fears was to face them together.
