You're practicing CPR on a fake dummy and you do a bit too well. The dummy starts gasping for air.
As a nurse in my local hospital, I have undergone countless CPR training sessions. While I'm confident I have memorized the procedures, I have never actually had to perform CPR on a real person, all I've ever done is on dummies. So when I was called to the training room for another CPR exercise, I did not think much of it - just another routine drill, I thought. 

As we gathered in the training room, the instructor handed out the usual dummy to each of us to practice CPR on. I began to work on "my patient", focusing on the compressions and performing the required steps of the training. But through my focused practice, I noticed that after several compressions on the chest, my dummy seemed to be moving along with the compressions too. It wasn’t supposed to. I initially thought that I must be overdoing it. However, I continued to follow my training and kept the pace of the compressions consistent.

I then began breathing air into the dummy's plastic lungs, and sure enough, I heard a weak and airy noise in response from the dummy. I was utterly confused, feeling as if I must be doing something wrong. Then I saw its chest began to move and saw that it was gasping for air! I immediately stopped, looking around to see if anyone else had noticed what was happening, but the training room was quiet, and everyone was focused on their practice.

Feeling panicked and worried about what I had done to the dummy, I quickly called over the instructor to inspect the dummy. As soon as he saw the gasping dummy, his eyes were as wide as saucers, and he yelled for us to stop and gather around. The room was filled with confusion, while everyone tried to figure out what was happening. I felt terrible, thinking that I had somehow broken the dummy and set off the alarm by doing something wrong.

The instructor sprang into action, examining the dummy as I stood there speechless and shaken, mentally reviewing all that I had done during the practice. Then, I was surprised by the instructor's response to the dummy's gasps: “Congratulations," he said. "You have just saved a life.” 

I was bewildered; 'saved a life'? I couldn’t have, it was just a dummy! I looked back at the instructor, waiting for an explanation. "The dummy was designed to activate and respond," he continued. "It only does that when it registers successful CPR efforts." I was stunned by the revelation and was filled with a great sense of accomplishment. I couldn’t believe what my CPR training had done; it had made me capable of saving lives.

The reality of the situation began to set in; what if it had been a real person - a real human being instead of a dummy? The surge of sobering thoughts hit me. CPR can be what saves someone's life; it can impact and give second chances to people. The practice was no longer a drill, it became a matter of life and death. All the previous practices I thought were ‘routine’ took a whole new meaning.

"By doing so well on the dummy here, I am sure you will excel on human patients as well," the instructor said, causing me to tear up, and the realization that I might just be capable of saving someone. It was frightening yet inspiring at the same time. I knew the next time I had to perform CPR on someone, I would have to fight my initial fear and hyperventilation and just focus on what I've trained for.

From that day forward, I went into each training session with a newfound sense of purpose. Seeing a dummy gasping for air no longer frightened me, now it filled me with hope. And as I work and interact with patients in need of CPR, I will remember the incredible moment that my practice gave me as a sign to keep on going and never give up on saving a life.
