You're a perky, blonde cheerleader and you've found yourself in a horror movie. However, you're an educated woman you are sick of this crap.
I never would have imagined that I, Brittany, the poster child for peppy cheerleaders, would find myself in a horror movie. Yet, here I am, running through the woods in search of an escape, with a crazed killer in pursuit. 

At the beginning of this nightmare, I held onto the assumption that I could trust the people around me. After all, we were all on a retreat together, supposedly to bond as teammates. But then, people started disappearing. 

At first, I convinced myself that they had simply snuck away to do something stupid. But when they didn't return, I started to suspect that something more nefarious was at play. I voiced my concerns to the group, but they brushed me off, insisting that I was overreacting. 

Finally, it became clear that there was indeed a killer among us, and I barely escaped with my own life. The other girls were not so lucky. They either didn't heed my warnings or simply trusted the wrong people. 

As I scramble to safety, my nerves are on edge. I've always been the type to put on a brave face, but deep down, I'm terrified. Every time I hear a twig snap or a bird chirp, I feel as though my heart will burst out of my chest. 

But amidst the chaos and fear, there was something else simmering inside me. Anger. Frustration. This shouldn't be happening to a group of smart, educated, young women. We were supposed to be more than just stereotypes. 

I was tired of the media depicting us as ditzy airheads, only good for flipping and twirling on the sidelines. We were more than just pom-poms and short skirts. We had earned our way onto this team with blood, sweat, and tears, just like any other athlete. 

As I run through the woods, ducking behind trees and trying to stay out of view, I feel a sudden surge of defiance. This isn't who I am. I'm not just some bubbly cheerleader. I'm a person with value and intelligence. And if I'm going to make it out alive, I need to tap into that part of me. 

So, I take a moment to catch my breath and to think. I can hear the killer's footsteps, getting closer and closer. But I refuse to give up. 

I search my pockets, relieved to find my cellphone still tucked inside. Maybe I can call for help? But as I swipe through my contacts, I realize there's nobody on here who could save us. Nobody in authority. 

That's when I remember something else. Something unexpected, yet somehow perfect. 

My dad. 

He may not be a cop or a soldier, but he's always been my protector. And he's always told me to be smart, to use my brain instead of just my brawn. So, I dial his number, knowing that he'll be able to help me if I can just hold out long enough. 

As I hear the dial tone, my heart swells with hope. I know that it'll only be a matter of time before the killer catches up to me, but I feel less afraid now. I have a plan. 

"Dad!" I whisper frantically, my eyes darting around for any sign of the killer. 

"Brittany? What's going on?" His voice is full of concern. 

"I'm in trouble. There's a killer on the loose and I need you to call the police and send them to our location!" I can hear my own voice shaking, but I try to stay calm. 

"Where are you?" 

"I'm at the retreat, in the woods. I don't know how else to describe it. Please, dad!" 

"Okay, okay. I'll make some calls and see what I can do. Brittany, listen to me. You're going to be okay. Just try to find a place to hide and stay there until help arrives." 

As I hang up the phone, I feel my resolve growing. I'm not just a victim. I'm not just a stereotype. I'm a person with a purpose, and I refuse to let this killer take that away from me. 

I spot a nearby cabin and make a beeline for it, hoping that I can barricade myself inside before the killer catches up. To my relief, the door is unlocked, and I hurry inside, looking for anything that could be used as a weapon. 

It's not much, but I find a fireplace poker and hold onto it tightly, ready to defend myself if necessary. I hear the killer outside, breathing heavily, and I brace myself for the worst. 

But then, there's a loud crashing sound, and I hear the killer scream in surprise. I peek outside the window, and to my shock, I see the rest of my team storming in, weapons and all, ready to take down whoever is threatening us. 

In that moment, I feel a wave of relief and camaraderie. We may have started off as cliche cheerleaders, but we've now become so much more. We're a team, working together to survive. And we won't let anyone take that away from us.
