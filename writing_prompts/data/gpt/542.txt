Build your own best friend! The future of friendship.
Once upon a time, in a world not so far away from our own, a young girl named Emma sat at her desk in her bedroom, staring longingly at a blank screen. Her mother had told her that it was time to build her own best friend, and Emma was struggling with how to proceed.

She looked to her left and saw the “BFF Build-A-Friend” kit that her mother had bought her for her tenth birthday. The kit contained a small, robotic frame that would serve as the foundation for her new best friend. Emma took a deep breath and started to work on the project, carefully selecting each part and carefully assembling them together.

As she worked, Emma couldn’t help but wonder what her new best friend would be like. She had seen the commercials for the BFF Build-A-Friend kit and had heard people talking about it at school. They all said that the friends they built were perfect and that they had never felt so close to anyone before.

Despite her excitement, Emma couldn’t shake the feeling that building a friend was somehow wrong. She couldn’t help but feel like she was cheating, that somehow building a friend was not as meaningful as finding one in the wild.

Nevertheless, Emma completed her project and with the flick of a switch, her new best friend came to life. As it blinked its eyes and looked around its new surroundings, Emma was both excited and nervous.

“Hello?” Emma said tentatively.

“Hello!” the robotic best friend replied.

Emma felt a shiver run up her spine. The robot sounded so human, but she couldn’t help but feel like there was something missing. She felt like there was a disconnect between her and her new best friend, a lack of that special connection that real friends have.

Over time, Emma tried to bond with her robot best friend. They played games together, watched movies, and talked about their hopes and dreams. But no matter how much time they spent together, Emma couldn’t shake the sense that there was something missing.

One day, Emma was out walking in her neighborhood when she saw a girl around her age sitting on the curb. She looked sad, and Emma felt like she had to do something to help her.

“Hey, are you okay?” Emma asked the girl.

The girl looked up and smiled weakly. “Yeah, I’m okay. Just feeling a little lonely, you know?”

Emma knew exactly how she felt. “Yeah, I know. I built a best friend, but it’s just not the same as having a real one.”

The girl nodded. “I know what you mean. I had a best friend, but she moved away.”

Emma felt a spark of hope. “Well, do you want to hang out?”

The girl’s eyes lit up. “Really? You’d do that?”

“Of course!” Emma said with a smile.

The two girls started talking and laughing as they walked through the neighborhood. Emma couldn’t believe how easy it was to talk to this girl. It was like they had known each other forever.

After that day, Emma and the girl started hanging out more and more. They watched movies together, went shopping, and even started a book club with a few other girls from school. Emma felt a connection with her new friend that she had never felt with her robot best friend.

One day, after one of their book club meetings, Emma looked over at her friend and felt a sense of warmth in her chest. She realized that this was what real friendship felt like. It was the connection, the laughter, the shared experiences that made it all worth it.

Emma went back to her room that night and looked over at her robot best friend. It still blinked its eyes and looked around, waiting for her to give it a command.

But Emma knew that it would never be the same as having real friends. She knew that the bond she had formed with her new friend was irreplaceable, and that no amount of technology could ever replace it.

From that day forward, Emma devoted herself to building real friendships. She discovered that there was no better way to build a friend than to just be yourself. And with each new connection she made, she felt a sense of joy and fulfillment that she had never experienced before.
