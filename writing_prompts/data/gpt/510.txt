The door will close. It's the only way in... and the only way out.
Alice had never been more nervous in her life. She stared at the door in front of her, knowing that the moment she stepped through it, there would be no turning back. It was the only way in – and the only way out.

Her heart raced as she thought about what lay beyond that door. She had heard stories of the horrors that awaited her, but she had no choice. She had to go through the door if she wanted to save her sister.

Her sister had been taken from her a week ago, and Alice had been searching for her ever since. She finally found a lead, a clue that brought her to this old, abandoned building. She had been told that her sister was inside, but the only way to get to her was through this door.

Alice took a deep breath and pushed open the door. It creaked loudly, the sound echoing throughout the empty building. She stepped inside and the door slammed shut behind her.

She was met with darkness. She couldn't see anything in front of her. She hesitated for a moment, but then she heard a sound. It was her sister's voice – she knew it!

She followed the sound, slowly making her way through the darkness. Her heart pounded in her chest as she thought about what she might face. She didn't know who had taken her sister, or what their intentions were.

Finally, she arrived at another door. She pushed it open, and this time, the light flooded in. Alice had to blink a few times to adjust to the brightness.

She found herself in a large room, with metal cages lining the walls. In one of the cages, her sister was sitting, looking up at her with tears in her eyes.

Alice rushed over to the cage, unlocking it in a flash. Her sister jumped out of the cage and into her arms.

"It's okay, I'm here," she said, hugging her sister tightly.

As they turned to leave, Alice heard a noise behind her. When she turned back, the door was closed. Panic set in and she tried to open it, but it was locked. The only way in was now the only way out.

Alice knew that they were trapped, but she wasn't scared. She wrapped her arm around her sister's shoulders and pulled her close. They would face whatever came their way together.
