The alien species Zorg was on a mission to make contact with humans and initiate peaceful relations. They had traveled for billions of light-years, crossing through countless galaxies, to reach Earth. After reaching the Earth’s atmosphere, they sent out their message of peace and waited for a response.

But, to their horror, the first message received from humans was not one of gratitude or welcome. Instead, it was a crude and obscene image of male genitalia.

The Zorg was left agape, confused, and appalled at the immature behavior displayed by humans. They had come to Earth with the aim of bringing peace and enlightening humans, but this kind of reaction was unexpected.

The message was particularly puzzling for the Zorg, for it was not only inappropriate but also indecipherable. They had to assign a team of linguists to help them interpret it. The linguists concluded that it was a picture of a human’s reproductive organ and was meant as an insult.

The Zorg made several attempts to reach out to humans again, but to no avail. They tried communicating through their advanced technology, but even that was met with hostility and suspicion from the humans.

The Zorg were disheartened, and their mission to make contact with humans was seemingly falling apart. But they refused to give up. They poured all their resources into decoding human language, behavior, and mannerisms.

Gearing up, the Zorg finally got through to humans again using a language they had recently mastered: humor. They sent out their message in the form of a meme, causing the humans to finally take notice and respond positively. Thus, the ice was broken, and the Zorg were finally able to initiate a peaceful dialogue with the humans.

The Zorg learned that not all humans were hostile, and the crude behavior was only limited to a few individuals. The incident also taught them that one shouldn’t judge an entire civilization based on the actions of a few.

And so, the Zorg and the humans went on to build an alliance, manifested through advancements in technology, trade, and cultural exchanges that would last for generations to come.
