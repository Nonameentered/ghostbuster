My life changed forever on a random Wednesday evening when I was sitting on the toilet, ready to do my business. I felt a strange sensation in my gut, followed by a sharp pain, and then something slipped out of me. It wasn't a regular poop, it was a black and brown reptilian creature, shaped exactly like a turd, with human eyes that looked at me with a mix of anger and confusion.

I thought it must be a hallucination, or some kind of weird joke my body was playing on me, so I flushed it down the toilet. The moment I did, I heard a cry, like that of a human baby. My heart skipped a beat, and I stood frozen for several seconds, trying to process what had just happened. Then I heard a louder cry, followed by another, and another. I had no choice but to flush again, drowning out the cries with the sound of rushing water.

I thought it was over, but I was wrong. The next day, while at work, I felt the same sensation in my gut. I knew what was coming, and I panicked. I rushed to the toilet, ignoring the curious looks of my coworkers, and sat down. I pushed, and another reptilian creature came out, looking even angrier than the first one. This time, I hesitated to flush it down, but I didn't know what else to do.

When I heard the cries again, I knew I had made a mistake. It was a sound that haunted me for days, every time I went to the bathroom. I tried to ignore it, I tried to convince myself that it wasn't real, but I couldn't. It was as real as the pain in my gut, as the smell that permeated my bathroom, as the sight of those creatures with human eyes that stared at me with an accusing look.

I started to avoid going to the bathroom, which was impossible, of course. But every time I had to go, I felt a sense of dread that made my skin crawl. I stopped eating, I stopped drinking as much water as I should, I stopped living. I was consumed by this strange curse that had befallen me. I tried to find a solution, I searched the internet, I consulted doctors, but no one had an answer. It was as if I was the only one in the world suffering from this peculiar affliction.

Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. I lost weight, I lost sleep, I lost my mind. I became a shell of a man, haunted by the cries of those creatures that tormented me every time I flushed them down the toilet. I was alone, miserable, and afraid.

Then, one day, something unexpected happened. I was sitting on the toilet, trying to push out one of those reptilian creatures, when I heard a different kind of cry. It was louder, more urgent, and yet more comforting. It was the cry of a human baby. 

I froze, unsure of what to do. I thought I was hallucinating again, or maybe I had gone insane. But the cry persisted, it grew louder, and I realized it was coming from the adjacent stall. Someone was giving birth in the men's room.

I didn't know what to do, I was in shock. But then something clicked inside of me. I thought about all those creatures, those living turds, with human eyes that cried like babies. I thought about the pain that their cries caused me, how they had driven me to the brink of madness. And then I realized something.

I had to help that baby.

I rushed out of the stall, forgetting to wipe, forgetting everything else, and went to the next stall. It was locked, but I could hear the woman inside, struggling to give birth. I knocked on the door, and shouted, "Ma'am, do you need help? I'm here to help!"

There was a moment of silence, and then I heard her voice. "Yes, please help me! My husband is stuck in traffic, and I can't do this alone!"

I didn't think, I just acted. I kicked the door down, and there she was, a woman in labor, sweating and crying. The baby's head was already out, and I could see the top of its head covered in dark hair, just like mine. I rushed to her side, and held her hand. I told her everything would be okay, that I would help her deliver the baby.

It was a surreal moment, one that I will never forget. But what happened next was even more surreal.

As the baby came out, a black and brown reptilian creature slipped out with it. But this one was different. It had wings, and it was not angry or confused. It was peaceful, almost serene. It looked at me with its human eyes, and then it flew away, out of the window, into the sunset.

I was speechless, but the woman was ecstatic. She was holding her newborn baby, crying tears of joy, thanking me for my help. I looked at her, and then at the broken stall door, and then at the toilet covered in reptilian feces. I smiled, a genuine smile, for the first time in months.

I knew that I was cursed, but I also knew that I had a purpose. I had to help those creatures. I had to deliver them, no matter the pain, no matter the sound of their cries. I had to be the one to set them free, to give them a chance to fly away, like that baby with its wings. I had to be the one to flush them down the toilet, but with kindness and compassion, not fear and dread.

Life would never be the same, but I was not alone anymore. I had a mission, and I was ready to face it, no matter what.
