Every thousand years a great cataclysm occurs. It is simply known as Kuroyuki. The Black Snow.
Once upon a time, in a land called Narokurai there was a legend that every thousand years a great cataclysm would occur. It was said that the sky would turn black as coal and snow would fall nonstop for days on end. The only thing that could break the curse was the magical sword that was passed down through the generations of the ruling family.

No one knew how the curse began, or even why it was happening. But every time the curse would come the people of Narokurai would be gripped by fear and despair. That's how the curse came to be known as Kuroyuki, the Black Snow.

The people had been living in constant fear of the cursed snow, they knew the sword of the ruling family was the only thing that could save them. The sword was known as ‘Kusanagi no Tsurugi’, it was said to be so powerful it could cut through the hardest of rocks and metals, but the sword was nowhere to be found.

As the thousandth year approached, the people of Narokurai were in a state of panic and desperation. They had searched every corner of the kingdom for the sword, but it was nowhere to be found.

The ruling family of Narokurai, the Hosokawa clan, knew that the sword was their responsibility. For centuries the sword had been kept safe within the Hosokawa family, but it had been stolen and lost during one of their wars. The curse was approaching fast, and the Hosokawa clan knew they had to find the sword before it was too late.

With the help of their trusted advisors, the Hosokawa clan devised a plan to find the sword. They would send out warriors to search for the sword in every corner of the kingdom. They knew it was a long-shot, but they couldn’t give up hope.

As the days passed, the people became increasingly restless. The snow was starting to fall, and the dark clouds had begun to gather in the sky. Everyone was bracing themselves for the worst, knowing that their death was near.

But, in the midst of all the chaos, there was a young warrior called Yuuto. He was a brave and fearless young man who had always dreamed of serving the royal family. When he heard about the curse, he knew he had to do everything in his power to save Narokurai from Kuroyuki.

One day, Yuuto decided to go out into the wilderness on his own to search for the sword. As he travelled through the mountains and forests, he met an old man who knew of the sword's whereabouts. The old man had been a friend of the Hosokawa clan for many years, and he knew it was his duty to help them in their hour of need.

The old man explained to Yuuto that the sword had been hidden in a secret chamber that was located deep beneath the mountains. He explained that the chamber was guarded by powerful spirits and that only someone with pure heart and unwavering devotion could retrieve the sword.

With that knowledge, Yuuto set out on his journey to retrieve the sword. He travelled for days on end, fighting fierce beasts and overcoming great obstacles along the way. He finally arrived at the entrance to the secret chamber, and he knew that this was his moment of truth.

As he approached the entrance, he was greeted by the spirits. They were immense, towering beasts that glinted red in the glowing light of the chamber. Yuuto knew that he had to pass their test in order to retrieve the sword.

In a moment of clarity, Yuuto remembered a piece of advice that his mentor gave him when he was young. He spoke the words out loud, "A true warrior is not only strong, he is also kind, compassionate and has a spirit that radiates warmth and love."

With that, one of the spirits stepped forward and handed Yuuto the sword. It was as if the spirits knew that he was the only one who possessed the qualities to save Narokurai from Kuroyuki.

Yuuto felt a wave of relief and satisfaction wash over him, knowing that he had achieved the impossible. He quickly ran back to Narokurai, determined and eager to break the curse. When he finally arrived at the town, the snow had already started falling.

Yuuto charged towards the Hosokawa clan residence, holding Kusanagi no Tsurugi in his grasp. When he arrived, he was greeted with cheers and applause from the people on the streets. The Hosokawa family welcomed Yuuto in and readied him for the final battle.

The snow was now falling heavily, and the sky was jet black. Nothing could be seen in any direction. At the top of the hill, Yuuto raised Kusanagi no Tsurugi towards the sky, and with a single swing, the clouds parted, and the sun shone through.

The curse had been lifted! The snow turned into harmless flakes that melted on the ground as soon as they touched it. The people of Narokurai rejoiced, and Hosokawa clan declared that Yuuto was the greatest warrior to ever live.

In the years to come, the people of Narokurai experienced flourishing prosperity and have been forever thankful for Yuuto's heroism in lifting the curse of Kuroyuki. They knew that it was his pure heart, bravery, and compassion that made all the difference. And the sword of the Hosokawa clan was once again kept safely until it was to be called upon again.
