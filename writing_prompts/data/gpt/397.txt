As the world came crashing down around him, the only thing that remained constant for John was the broom in his hand. He had always found comfort in the act of sweeping, the methodical back and forth motion of the bristles, the sound of dirt being collected. But now, he swept with a sense of urgency.

His heart thudded in his chest as he watched the sky turn a sickly shade of green. The ground shook beneath his feet, and he knew that it was only a matter of time before the end arrived. He swept faster, desperate to make even a small difference in the chaos.

As he finished the last stroke, he paused and looked up at the sky once more. It was then that he saw the glimmer of hope, a single ray of sunlight bursting through the clouds. John took a deep breath and gripped his broom tightly, determined to help clean up the world and start anew.
