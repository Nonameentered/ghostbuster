After nearly one hundred generations on the colony ship, the original mission had become like a religion for many. So much so that some believed it more than their own beliefs in God.

The ship's initial mission was to seek out new life and establish a new world, a world that their ancestors had left behind. However, with time, the mission had slowly begun to fade away. While the elders remembered the mission as though it was yesterday, the younger generation were less concerned about the ship's original purpose and focused more on their daily lives and challenges within the confines of the ship.

Barry was one of the few believers left. He remembered the mission with clarity as his great-grandfather was one of the pioneers who set up shop on the ship. His great-grandfather had told him many stories about the struggles they had faced when the ship's fuel began to deplete, and the journey took them longer than they had anticipated.

Barry was aware that many of his peers had stopped believing in the mission, and some had even labeled it as a false prophecy. He had spent many years trying to convince them of the mission's importance, but his efforts had often been shut down. However, Barry was not one to give up easily.

Upon hearing about a new group of settlers who had built a small community, Barry saw a spark of hope. This group was made up of the younger generation, similar to Barry's age. He saw this as an opportunity to spread the message and revive the mission's importance.

Barry joined the community with vigor, eager to win over the hearts and minds of the new settlers. The community leaders welcomed him with open arms, and he began to share his great-grandfather's stories and the importance of the mission.

However, he was met with skepticism. The settlers had never heard of the mission and were more preoccupied with their present worries, such as how to grow enough food on their limited land. Barry was persistent, and he spent many hours trying to convince the settlers of the mission's importance.

Eventually, his persistence paid off, and a small group of settlers began to see the value in the mission. They began to take up positions that would help advance the cause. With time, even those who were initially skeptical had begun to see the mission's importance.

It was a beautiful sight for Barry to witness. He had rekindled the flame inside them, and they were now ready and willing to carry out the mission that their ancestors had embarked upon nearly a hundred years ago.

Over the years, the small community grew, and their efforts bore fruit. They had managed to establish a new world, a world of their own where they could thrive without the limitations of the ship. However, it was not without its challenges.

One such challenge came in the form of those who denied the mission's existence. They saw it as a false belief and preached that there was no original mission. These disbelievers were few in number, but their words held weight amongst the younger generation. With their words, they caused a rift within the community.

Barry watched in horror as the community he had dedicated years of his life to began to tear apart. Some accused the others of spreading false beliefs, while others accused them of losing sight of the original mission.

The community was on the brink of collapse, and Barry knew he had to act quickly. He gathered the community leaders and reminded them of the mission's importance and the benefits it had brought them so far. He reminded them of the struggles their ancestors had faced and the price they had paid for them to be here today.

The community leaders were moved by Barry's words, and together they decided to hold a vote. The vote would determine whether the mission was still relevant or not. The vast majority of the community members voted in favor of the mission.

With that, the disbelievers were silenced, and the community was once again united. Barry felt a sense of relief, knowing that his efforts had not been in vain. His great-grandfather would have been proud.

The colony ship had served its purpose, and the community had fulfilled its mission. A new world had been established, and they had made it a home. It had not been without its challenges, but they had overcome them. In the end, they were living proof that when people come together and work towards a common goal, anything is possible.
