Hey there! Greetings from the start of our road trip! My best friend, Sara, and I have just set out from our small hometown in Iowa, and we're heading west towards California. The plan is to hit as many iconic destinations as we can on our way there, so we're feeling pretty excited right now!

I just had to send you this postcard from the Badlands in South Dakota. The scenery is absolutely breathtaking! We hiked some of the trails yesterday and it was truly an unforgettable experience. The heat is starting to get to us, but we're pushing through the sweat and the miles.

We made it to Yellowstone National Park! It's incredibly beautiful here, and we saw our first wild bison today. We're planning on staying in the park for a few more days before heading south towards the Grand Canyon.

We had a few tough days of driving, but we finally made it to the Grand Canyon! Words can't describe how awe-inspiring it is to see it in person. We splurged on a helicopter tour and it was so worth it. We're feeling incredibly grateful for this trip and the opportunities it has given us.

The desert is a strange and beautiful place. We're currently in Joshua Tree National Park, and it's unlike any other landscape we've seen on this trip. We've been hiking every day and soaking up the sun, but it's starting to take a toll on our tired bodies.

Greetings from Los Angeles! We made it to the West Coast and the excitement is palpable. We've been exploring the city, taking in all the sights and sounds. We even got a glimpse of the Hollywood sign today! Our next stop is San Francisco, but for now we're feeling pretty enamored with LA.

San Francisco has been a blast so far! We've explored Golden Gate Park, biked across the Golden Gate Bridge, and eaten our weight in seafood. We're taking a few days to rest up before we start driving back towards Iowa. This trip has been the adventure of a lifetime, and we can't wait to see what's in store for us on the way home!
