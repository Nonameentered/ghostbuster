I woke up to my roommate shaking me frantically, shouting about time no longer existing. Rubbing the sleep out of my eyes, I tried to make sense of what he was saying. He kept repeating the same thing, “There’s no time, we have to go”. Panic was visible in his eyes.

I got up, still unsure of what was going on. As I stepped out of my room, I saw the clock on the wall wasn’t ticking. Was my roommate telling the truth? Was time really gone?

My roommate grabbed my hand, and we ran out of our apartment. Outside, the sky was dark despite it being morning. No cars were moving, and people were frozen in place. It was as if time had indeed stopped.

Fearful and confused, we ran towards the city center. There, we found a group of people in the same situation as us. None of us had any idea what was going on.

In that moment, we realized that life without time was unimaginable. We were all lost in a world where the concept of minutes and hours no longer existed. And we didn’t know if there was any way to get it back.
