I am writing this story from my apartment, hiding in the closet. It all started with a few reports on the news of a virus outbreak in China, but I didn't pay much attention to it. However, it soon spread like wildfire to the neighboring countries, and before we knew it, the infection had reached our town.

People were not prepared for it, and it spread quickly. It started with a few cases, and in a matter of days, it turned into a disaster. The streets were filled with the undead, and they were hunting for fresh blood.

I heard the screams and the moans of the infected from my window. My heart raced with fear, and I knew I had to seek safety. I ran to the closet, grabbed a few essentials, and locked myself in.

As I sat there, trembling with fear, I thought about my family and friends. Were they safe? Had they managed to escape? I had no way of knowing. All I could do was wait and hope for a miracle.

Hours passed by, and it was silent outside. I dared to peek outside the window and saw that the streets were empty. I felt relieved but cautious. Did the zombies give up and head to another place? Or did they all die off? I knew I had to find a way to leave my apartment and see what's happening outside.

I slowly opened the door and took a deep breath. I stepped out and saw that the streets were littered with debris and bodies. The smell of death lingered in the air, and the sight of it made me vomit. I saw that the majority of the zombies were gone but, there were a few stragglers still wandering around. I knew I had to be careful.

With my heart pounding, I made my way to the nearest grocery store, hoping to find food and any other survivors. To my surprise, I ran into a group of survivors that had managed to barricade themselves in there. They welcomed me in with open arms, happy to see another living soul.

We all sat down and discussed our plan for survival. We had to band together and fight off the zombies. It was a long road ahead, but we had each other, and that was enough to give us some hope.
