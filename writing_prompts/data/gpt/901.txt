As a dragon enthusiast, Maxine had always thought that counting dragons was a straightforward task. After all, there were only a couple of dragon breeds, and they weren't known for camouflage or evasiveness. So, when her friend John asked her how many dragons were outside, she didn't think twice before replying, "a few."

However, as they stepped out of the house, Maxine was faced with a scene unlike any other. The sky was thick with dragons, of all shapes and sizes, with scales that shone like precious jewels. They breathed fire and smoke, and their wings flapped so loudly that the ground shook.

"Is this your definition of 'a few'?" John yelled over the chaos.

Maxine realized that she had made a grave mistake. She had used a subjective term for an objective situation, and now they were both in danger. They ran back into the house, barricading themselves in until the dragons simmered down.

Lesson learned, Maxine promised to be more objective in the future.
