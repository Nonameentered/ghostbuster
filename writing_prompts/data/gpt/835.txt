The phone rings. You look at the caller ID and recognize the number of your childhood home. You pick up the phone and recognize the voice. It was yours when you were a kid.
I was sitting in my apartment, flipping through channels on a lazy Sunday afternoon when my phone rang. I glanced at the caller ID and my heart skipped a beat. It was the number for my childhood home. My parents had passed away a few years ago, and the house had been sold, so I couldn't imagine who would be calling from there. With trembling fingers, I answered the phone.

"Hello?" I said hesitantly.

"Hi there," a familiar voice said. It was mine. But not my current voice. It was the voice I had when I was a kid.

I felt like I was in a daze as I listened to myself chatter on about school and friends and what I had done that day. It was like stepping back in time. The sound of my own childish voice brought a smile to my face, and I felt a rush of memories flood back.

I listened for a while longer, curious to hear what my younger self would say. The conversation was mundane, but it was a piece of my past I had never expected to revisit. After a few minutes, I felt a lump form in my throat. I missed that time in my life, when everything seemed so simple and carefree.

I finally spoke up. "Hey, um, it's me, current me, I mean."

There was a silence on the other end of the line before young me gasped. "Are you really me from the future? Like, Back to the Future style?"

I couldn't help but chuckle at my younger self's excitement. "Yeah, something like that."

"What's it like?" young me asked eagerly.

I took a deep breath, thinking about how to answer that. "It's complicated. It's not always easy, but there are a lot of good things too. You just have to take the bad with the good and keep moving forward."

"Oh." There was a pause. "I don't really get it."

I smiled despite myself. "That's okay. You will someday. How about I tell you about some of the things you should look forward to?"

I was surprised at how naturally it came, talking to myself from the past. We talked for hours, about everything from my current job to my relationship status. It was like catching up with an old friend, one who knew me better than anyone else.

As the day wore on, I found myself opening up to my younger self in ways I never would have with anyone else. I shared the struggles I had faced, the mistakes I had made, and the lessons I had learned along the way. I wanted to protect my younger self from the hardships of life, but I knew I couldn't. Instead, I tried to prepare her as best I could.

Eventually, the conversation started to wind down. I could hear the exhaustion in my younger self's voice, and I couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt. Had I really been that innocent and carefree once?

"I have to go now," I said softly. "But, hey, if you ever need to talk, I'm always here for you. Even if it's just to say hi."

There was a pause before my younger self responded. "Thanks. That means a lot."

We said our goodbyes, and I hung up the phone. I sat there for a long time, lost in thought. It wasn't often that I got to revisit my past like that, and it was a strange feeling. I wondered if I would have done anything differently if I had the chance.

As the sun started to set outside, I realized something. Maybe I couldn't change the past, but I could change the present and the future. I could make a conscious effort to live in the moment, appreciate the people I had in my life, and always look for the silver lining in any situation.

Over the next few weeks, I found myself thinking about that phone call often. It had given me a new perspective, one that I carried with me every day. I started to see things in a new light, noticing details I had overlooked before. I treasured simple moments like the sound of my neighbor's laughter or the way the sun streamed in through my window in the morning.

And, when life got tough, which it inevitably did, I reminded myself of that phone call. I thought about my younger self, and how I would tell her that everything would be okay. And then, I told myself the same thing.

Years went by, and I moved on with my life. I formed new relationships, traveled the world, and explored new passions. It was a fulfilling life, but every so often, I would dial that old number, just to hear my younger self's voice and see how she was doing.

And then, one day, the number was disconnected. I wasn't surprised, but it still felt like a part of me was missing. I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and whispered a thank you to the universe for giving me that one special day.

I knew that the little girl on the other end of the line was still with me, somewhere deep inside. She had grown up, but she had never truly gone away. She was a part of me, and she always would be. And, even though I could never go back to that time, part of me still wished I could. To feel that innocence and joy once again, if only for a moment.

But, in the end, I realized that I didn't need to go back. Because that little girl had been with me all along, reminding me to live in the moment and appreciate the simple things in life. And with that realization, I knew that everything would be okay. Because, no matter what happened, that little girl would always be there, waiting to remind me of the beauty in the world.
