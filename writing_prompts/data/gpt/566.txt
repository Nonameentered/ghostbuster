I stepped out of the time machine and was immediately taken aback. This couldn't be right – I wasn't supposed to arrive in this time period. I had programmed the machine to take me to the 1960s, but the surroundings were unfamiliar. The buildings were tall and gleaming, unlike the brick houses I had expected. The people around me were all dressed in metallic clothing and had strange gadgets in their hands.

I realized then that my time machine had malfunctioned. I must have arrived in the future, but how far in the future was anyone's guess. I wandered through the city, trying to understand my new surroundings. Everywhere I looked there were holograms and flying cars, and I couldn't help but feel both exhilarated and terrified.

I knew that I needed to find a way to fix my time machine and return to my own time. But for now, I was living in the future – and I had better get used to it.
