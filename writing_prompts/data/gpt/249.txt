Two friends are meeting at a high school reunion. They have not seen each other in 10 years. One of them is a congressman, the other one is a recovering heroin addict. The reader does not know which one is which.
The high school reunion was in full swing. The DJ was playing classic hits of the 90s, the dance floor was packed with people reminiscing about old times. Amidst all this, two friends were meeting after a gap of ten years.

As they approached each other, they both had a moment of hesitation. They had been good friends in high school, but ten years is a long time, and a lot can change.

"Hey there, buddy! It's great to see you after so long," said the taller of the two, extending his hand.

The other guy looked up at his friend and smiled. "Hey man, it's good to see you too," he said, shaking his friend's hand.

They stood there for a moment, looking at each other, trying to find the words to break the ice.

"So, what have you been up to?" asked the taller guy.

"Oh, nothing much. Just trying to keep my head above water," replied the other guy.

There was a moment of silence, and then the taller guy said, "So, what's new with you?"

"Well, I've been clean for a year now," said the other guy, with a hint of pride in his voice.

"That's great news! Congrats," said the taller guy, clapping his friend on the back.

The other guy smiled, feeling a sense of relief. He had been worried about telling his friend about his struggles with addiction.

"So, what about you? What have you been up to?" he asked, changing the subject.

The taller guy hesitated for a moment before replying, "I work in politics now."

"Oh, really? That sounds interesting. What do you do?" asked the other guy.

"I'm a congressman," said the taller guy, with a grin.

The other guy's eyes widened in surprise. He couldn't believe it. His friend, the guy he used to play video games with and ditch class with, was a congressman.

"That's amazing! I had no idea," he said, genuinely impressed.

They spent the rest of the evening catching up on old times, laughing and reminiscing about the past. As they said goodbye, they promised to keep in touch.

As the other guy drove home, he couldn't stop thinking about his friend's success. He was happy for him, but at the same time, he felt a twinge of envy. He wondered what his own life could have been like if he hadn't fallen into the trap of addiction.

But he pushed those thoughts aside and focused on the present. He had a good job, a supportive family, and most importantly, he was clean. And that was all that mattered.
