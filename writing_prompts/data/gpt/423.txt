We do not belong here, but it is the only'home' we have left.
We do not belong here, but it is the only home we have left. Those words echoed in my mind as I stood at the entrance of the dilapidated building, my hand on the rusty doorknob. This place, this abandoned gas station on the outskirts of town, was the last refuge for my friends and me. We were homeless, cast out by a society that didn't want us, didn't need us. But this place, this crumbling structure in the middle of nowhere, was ours.

I pushed open the door and stepped inside, taking in the familiar scent of musty air and mildew. The ceiling was caving in, and the walls were covered in graffiti and dirt. But to us, it was paradise. A place to rest our weary heads, to escape the harsh realities of life on the streets.

I was greeted by the sight of my friends huddled together, sharing a pack of cigarettes. They looked up as I entered, and I could see the relief in their eyes. Despite the hardships we faced here, we had each other, and that was enough to sustain us.

We had all been living on the streets for months, forced out of our homes by circumstance. Some of us had been kicked out by our families, others had fallen on hard times and lost everything. But we had found each other, and together we had formed a makeshift family. We took care of each other, shared everything we had, and looked out for one another.

As we settled into our routine, I couldn't help but think about how far we had fallen. We were all so different, from different backgrounds, different races, and religions. Before life on the streets, we would never have crossed paths, but now, we were all we had.

Every day was a struggle. We had to scavenge for food, beg for money, and do whatever it took to survive. Often, we were met with hostility and indifference from the people around us, who saw us as nothing more than a nuisance. But we persevered, driven by a fierce determination to hang on to each other and this place that we called home.

Life here was far from perfect, but it was ours. We were the masters of our domain, and no one could take that away from us. We had found a sense of belonging here, despite the circumstances that had brought us together.

Days turned into weeks, weeks turned into months, and we settled into a routine. It wasn't glamorous, but it was our life, and we were in control of it. But as time wore on, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to change. I sensed a growing restlessness among my friends, a longing for something more than just this existence of scraping by.

One day, as we sat around a makeshift campfire outside the gas station, we talked about our dreams, our hopes for the future. It was a rare moment of vulnerability, and I was surprised by what I heard. Despite everything, my friends still believed in a better life, still had dreams that they hoped to achieve one day.

In that moment, I realized that I was the only one who had given up on hope, who had resigned myself to a life on the streets. For me, this place was home, and I couldn't fathom leaving it, even if it meant a chance at a better life.

As the days passed, I watched my friends begin to take action. They looked for jobs, cleaned up their appearances, and started to dream of a life outside of this place. And as much as I wanted to be a part of that, I found myself digging in my heels, clinging to the only life I had ever known.

But one day, everything changed. A storm rolled in, one of the fiercest we had seen in months. The wind howled through the broken windows and rain poured in through the crumbling roof. We huddled together, trying to stay warm and dry, but it was no use. This place was no longer safe, no longer a refuge.

As we all ran outside, seeking shelter from the storm, I realized that this was it. We were being forced out of the only home we had left. And as much as I had resisted change, I knew it was time to let go, to take a chance on a better life.

A week later, we boarded a bus to a nearby city. It was a small first step, but it felt monumental to us. We had left behind the only home we had ever known, but we were taking a chance on a brighter future.

And as we rode that bus, my friends and I talked about all the possibilities that lay ahead. We talked about jobs, apartments, and even dreams of going back to school. We had hope once more, and it was a beautiful thing.

I don't know where life will take us from here, but I do know that we will face it together. We do not belong here, but it is the only home we have left. And now, we are ready to build a new one.
