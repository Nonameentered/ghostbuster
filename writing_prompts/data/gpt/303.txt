You are Death. For eons you have adhered to the ancient rules, collecting souls only when it their time, so as to not take sides in the war between God and the Devil. Well, the Devil's been a real dick lately... so you start choosing who dies & when, attempting tip the balance in God's favor.
For eons, I have collected souls only when it was their time, as per the ancient rules. My job as Death was to ensure the natural order of things was followed, and I had stayed dutifully neutral in the war between God and the Devil. But the Devil had been a real pain recently, and I had grown tired of his tricks.

It all started when a man named Richard died. He was a kind soul who had lived a life of great virtue, giving back to his community and always putting others before himself. When I arrived to collect his soul, I was met by a group of demons sent by the Devil himself. They attempted to prevent me from taking Richard's soul, claiming that he belonged in Hell because he had not believed in God during his life.

I couldn't believe it. Richard had lived a life of great goodness and compassion, and yet the Devil was trying to claim him? That was the moment when I knew I had to take matters into my own hands.

As Death, I had the power to choose who died and when. So, I started tipping the scale in God's favor by choosing to collect the souls of those who had lived good lives and deserved to be rewarded in the afterlife. I stopped adhering so strictly to the ancient rules and instead started relying on my own judgment.

At first, I was hesitant. After all, I had been following the same set of rules for centuries. But slowly, I began to see the positive impact my actions were having. People who had lived difficult lives were now being rewarded with a peaceful afterlife, and the scales were slowly balancing in God's favor.

The Devil took notice of my actions and tried to intervene. He sent his minions to interfere with my work, but I was determined. I continued to collect the souls of good people, regardless of their religious beliefs or any preconceived notions of who deserved to be saved.

The Devil grew furious with my actions and confronted me. "You have no right to interfere with the natural order of things," he seethed. "Your job is to collect souls when their time has come, not to take sides in this war."

But I was not deterred. "Your actions have proven that you do not deserve the souls of the good people who have lived on this earth," I told him firmly. "I will do what I can to tip the scales in God's favor, one soul at a time."

And so, I continued to choose who would live and who would die, always following my own moral compass. The Devil grew more frustrated with each passing day, as his power slowly weakened and his grip on humanity loosened.

But finally, the war came to an end. The Devil was defeated, and God emerged victorious. With the battle over, I was free to return to my natural order of things, collecting souls when their time had come and letting them move on to the afterlife.

Looking back on those trying times, I know I made the right decision. Choosing to side with God may have gone against the ancient rules, but sometimes going against the status quo is necessary to create positive change. And in the end, my actions led to a more just and fair world for all.
