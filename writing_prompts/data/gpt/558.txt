Instead of life followed by death, there is a third form of existence which ends once everyone living forgets you
Her life was not one that was meant to be forgotten. As a renowned writer, her words had touched the hearts of millions, and her ideas had sparked revolutions. But when she learned of the third form of existence, she knew that her legacy was not as secure as she thought.

The third form of existence was one that lasted only as long as people remembered you. The longer people remembered you after you were gone, the longer your existence would be. But once everyone who had ever known you had died, your existence would end. It was a strange and eerie concept, but one that had been confirmed by scientists.

At first, she laughed the idea off, thinking that she would be remembered for centuries to come. But as she grew older, she realized that the human memory was fickle. People forgot things even when they didn't want to, and she knew that her legacy was not immune to that.

She worked tirelessly to ensure that her work would be remembered for as long as possible. She wrote countless books and articles, gave speeches, and even started a foundation that would preserve her work after she was gone.

But as she lay on her deathbed, surrounded by loved ones, she knew that her fight was in vain. She had outlived most of her contemporaries, and soon, the only ones who would remember her would be those who had read her work.

As her eyes closed for the final time, she took comfort in the thought that, for just a little while longer, her legacy would live on.
