It was a dark and lonely night, and I was driving down an endless road in the middle of nowhere. The radio was blasting with a country song, but I could barely hear it over the sound of my car's engine. As I zoomed by, I saw the occasional hitchhiker trying to flag me down, but I never stopped to give them a ride. Something about this road made me feel uneasy, like there was danger looming in the shadows.

Every time I passed a hitchhiker, I felt a pang of guilt, but I was already committed to driving straight ahead. It was like a game of cat and mouse, with each traveler playing their part. I was the driver, and they were the hitchhikers waiting for their next victim.

But as the hours rolled by, I began to notice something strange. The hitchhiker I just passed seemed to appear once again, further down the road. It was as if I were going in circles. At first, I thought that it was just my imagination running wild, but then I realized that this was a reality I couldn't ignore.

Eventually, I had to stop the car and take a break. I had to regain my bearings and figure out what was happening. That's when I saw the first hitchhiker I passed by staring back at me with an unnerving expression. As if he knew what was going on, he smiled and beckoned me towards him.

All of a sudden, I felt a chill run down my spine. This was not the kind of ride I signed up for. I had to get out of there, fast.

I drove as fast as I could, my heart racing with fear. When I finally reached my destination, I looked back and saw all those hitchhikers disappearing into the darkness, their raised arms slowly falling back down.

To this day, I can still hear their whispers, beckoning me to come back and join them on that never-ending road. But I do not look back. I keep driving, always looking ahead, and never stopping for anyone.
