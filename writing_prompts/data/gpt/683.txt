Blood Dripping

Blood dripping from his blade, he kneeled and smeared it on her robe. His hand was shaking from the adrenaline and fear coursing through his body. He had never killed anyone before, especially not in such a gruesome way. But she had left him with no other choice.

It had all started a few months ago, when he met her at a dinner party. She was beautiful, sophisticated, and charming. They had hit it off right away and had started dating shortly after. For a while, everything was perfect. He had finally found someone who understood him and accepted him for who he was. They shared the same interests and humor, and they had never had an argument. Until she started changing.

At first, he didn't realize what was happening. She had started spending less and less time with him, and when they were together, she was always on her phone, texting and scrolling through social media. She had become distant and cold, and he didn't know why. But then, he found the messages.

She had been cheating on him for weeks, maybe even months. Sending love letters and explicit messages to another man. He couldn't believe it. He had trusted her, loved her, and this was what he got in return?

He confronted her about it, and at first, she tried to deny it. But when he showed her the evidence, she finally broke down and apologized. She said it was a mistake, that she still loved him, and that it would never happen again. He had forgiven her, foolishly thinking that things would go back to the way they were before.

But they didn't. She kept lying, sneaking around behind his back, and treating him like he was just a nuisance. He had never felt so angry and betrayed in his life. He had given her everything, and she had given him nothing but pain and humiliation.

That's why he did what he did. He had planned it for weeks, waiting for the right moment to strike. She had come to his place, expecting to spend a romantic evening with him. Instead, she found him waiting for her, his knife in hand.

He didn't even give her a chance to explain. He just attacked her, stabbing her repeatedly, until she fell to the ground, gasping for breath. He didn't feel any remorse or regret. He was just relieved that it was finally over. That he had regained control over his life and his emotions.

He kneeled beside her, watching the blood oozing out of her wounds. It was a dark, sticky liquid, staining her clothes and the floor. He felt a strange urge to touch it, to feel its warmth and texture on his skin. So he took his knife, still dripping with her blood, and smeared it on her robe.

It was a symbolic gesture, a way to mark his victory and her defeat. He knew that he would go to prison for what he had done, but he didn't care. He had nothing to lose anymore. He had already lost everything that mattered to him.

As he stood up, ready to face the consequences of his actions, he realized something. He had become just like her. A liar, a cheater, a monster. He had let his emotions take over and had acted on impulse, without considering the consequences of his actions. He had become the very thing he had despised.

But it was too late now. The damage had been done, and there was no going back. He walked out of his apartment, his hands still stained with her blood. He didn't look back. He just kept walking, into the darkness that awaited him.
