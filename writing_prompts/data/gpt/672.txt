Everyone has disappeared but you, you think that everyone is just holding surprise party for you.
I woke up to an empty house. At first, I thought my family had gone out for a walk or shopping. But as the day progressed, the realization hit me hard. Everyone was gone. My parents, siblings, and even the neighbors were nowhere to be found.

As the hours ticked by, my anxiety rose, and my mind kept racing through various scenarios. Did the Rapture happen, and I was left behind? Was it some kind of apocalypse, and I was the only survivor?

But then, my mind landed on an idea that made me feel a little better. It was my birthday, and everyone was probably hiding, preparing a massive surprise party for me. Yes, that must be it. As I thought about it, everything started to make sense. They were probably out collecting balloons and decorations - everything to make my day special.

So, I waited patiently, fighting the urge to leave the house. And as the night drew in, I felt certain they were all about to jump out, yelling, "Happy Birthday!" But the night turned into day, and yet, nothing happened.

Only then did I realize how foolish I had been. I was alone - deserted and forgotten.
