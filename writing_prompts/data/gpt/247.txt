You are a commercial airliner pilot. The moment before you turn your phone off to begin the flight your SO sends you a deeply concerning text.
As a commercial airliner pilot, I always make sure to put my phone on silent before starting the flight. However, just as I was about to turn it off, I received a text message from my significant other that immediately caught my attention.

The message was concerning and left me with a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. It read, "I need to talk to you as soon as possible. It's important. Please call me back."

I knew I had to remain composed and focused on my job, but I couldn't shake the worry from my mind.

The flight took off without any issues, but my thoughts kept returning to the message from my SO. I desperately wanted to know what was going on and whether they were okay.

I tried to put my concerns aside and concentrate on flying the plane. However, the weight of uncertainty was overwhelming and I found myself unable to concentrate.

As soon as I had the opportunity, I called my SO. They answered on the first ring, and their voice was shaky and trembled as they spoke.

"Hey, I'm sorry to bother you during your flight, but I couldn't wait any longer. My brother is in the hospital, and the doctors aren't sure what's wrong with him. I've been here all morning, and I just needed someone to talk to."

My heart sank. I felt so helpless and distant, unable to offer my support and comfort to the person I loved most in the world.

"I'm so sorry to hear that," I said, trying my best to remain calm and resolute. "Is there anything I can do? I hate that I can't be there for you right now."

We talked for a few more minutes, trying to find comfort in our words. Eventually, my SO said they had to go, and we hung up.

The rest of the flight passed in a blur. My mind anxiously raced with thoughts of my SO and their brother. I felt like I was flying on autopilot, going through the motions but not really present.

When we landed, I immediately checked my phone for any updates. There were none, but my mind was flooded with possibilities and worries.

Being a pilot is demanding, but nothing compares to the emotional stress of leaving someone you love behind. As I walked to the airport terminal, I was grateful to have a job that gave me the chance to be there for my SO when they needed me most. I prayed for a good news update once I got home, but first I had to fulfill my duty to the people on my flight.
