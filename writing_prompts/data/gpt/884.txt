You lived a quiet life, and in passing Death comes to collect your soul, but Death seems afraid of you.
I had always led a simple life. Never once did I crave for adventure or excitement. I went on with my days quietly, never really making a splash in a world filled with noise and color. But one day, death came to collect me, and I was surprised to see the fear in his eyes.

Death was a tall figure cloaked in a black robe. His skeletal hands held a scythe as he gave me a somber nod. I had always known that my time on earth was limited, but I never expected to face death with so little resistance.

"Are you ready?" Death asked in a voice that felt like it came from beyond.

I nodded in response, unsure of how else to react to this inevitable fate. But as death took a step towards me, he hesitated. In his mind, something seemed to be different about me. He looked back, unsure of whether to continue or not.

I could sense the fear in his eyes. Death, who had taken countless souls before, suddenly seemed unsure and hesitant to take mine. It was a rare instance of fear in a world dominated by death.

"You don't seem scared. Why aren't you scared?" he asked me.

I looked up at him, taking in the solemn figure before me. For some reason, I was not afraid. I had always known that death was inevitable, but something inside me felt ready to move on.

"I have always known that my time is limited. I have lived a good life, and I am ready to move on," I replied.

Death starred into my eyes, as if looking for something he hadn't expected to find. He knew that he could not take me by force. He could not drag me to wherever souls go after they pass. Instead, he took a step back, giving way for me to step forward at my own pace.

"It's your time. Take your final steps," Death said and stepped aside.

I took a step forward, and the world around me faded over the horizon. A bright light illuminated from the distance, growing brighter as I took each step. I walked towards it, feeling weightless, no longer tied down by the world that I had left behind.

As I reached the edge of light, I knew that death was no longer behind. He had turned back and disappeared into the darkness. My soul, finally free from mortal chains, moved forward, drawn towards the light. I knew that I was no longer afraid. In life, I had lived a quiet life, and in death, I was ready to embrace whatever was to come.
