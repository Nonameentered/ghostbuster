You were just shot and killed by a gunman. The gunman, gets killed shortly after by the police. Your souls meet on the'Train to Heaven'
I never expected to die so soon. In my mind, I had a million things I wanted to do and places I wanted to see. But fate had other plans for me. I had just finished stocking up at the grocery store when I heard a loud bang. Suddenly, everything went black.

The next thing I knew, I was standing on a train station platform. The surroundings were unfamiliar, but somehow I knew I was waiting for the train to Heaven. I looked around and spotted someone I never expected to see there.

It was the shooter who had killed me. He looked just as surprised to see me as I was to see him. He had a shocked expression on his face as if he was just as confused about what was happening as I was.

I approached him cautiously. "What happened?" I asked.

He looked at me and then at the ground. "I shot you," he replied in a low voice.

"Why?" I asked again.

He hesitated for a moment before replying. "I don't know. I was angry. I was frustrated with my life and I just snapped."

I looked at him with a mixture of sadness and anger. How could someone take another person's life so easily? "You took away my chance to live," I said.

"I'm sorry," he replied. "I really am."

I didn't know what to say or do next. I felt a sense of anger, but also compassion for him. I knew that he'd made a mistake, and now he was paying for it. Like me, he was waiting for the train to Heaven, and I was beginning to wonder if we'd even be allowed to board.

Before I could say anything else, a man in a white suit emerged from the train and walked towards us. He looked otherworldly, with his bright smile and serene expression. "Welcome," he said. "I'm here to help you get on the train."

Relieved, I stepped towards him, but the shooter hesitated. "What about me?" he asked.

The man in the white suit looked at me and then at the shooter. "You both have a ticket," he said. "You're both welcome on the train. But you must forgive each other."

I look at the shooter again, and he looked at me. We locked eyes, and then the words simply slipped out. "I forgive you," I said.

He looked surprised for a moment but then thanked me. "I'm sorry," he said again.

I turned to the man in the white suit. "I forgive him," I said.

The man in the white suit nodded. "That's good," he said. "Now, let's board the train."

We stepped into the train and found ourselves inside a bright, spacious compartment. There were other passengers inside, but they were all silent, as if lost in their own thoughts.

The shooter and I found an empty seat and sat down beside each other. We were silent for a moment, and then he spoke. "I don't know why I did it," he said. "I didn't mean to hurt anyone."

I looked at him and nodded. "I know," I said. "But sometimes we make mistakes, and we have to pay for them."

He nodded. "I just hope that there's a way for me to make up for what I've done."

Before I could reply, the train jerked and then started moving. It picked up speed quickly, and in the blink of an eye, we were surrounded by a tunnel of light. I looked at the shooter, and he looked at me. For the first time, we both smiled.

It wasn't the end, after all. It was just the beginning of a new journey. And we were both on it, together.
