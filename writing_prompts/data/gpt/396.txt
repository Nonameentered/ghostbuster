You discovered a long time ago that you have the ability to change other people's emotions at will. Describe your daily life.
Ever since I can remember, I have had this unique ability that allows me to control the emotions of the people around me. I discovered this ability when I was just six years old, and it has been a part of my life ever since.

My daily life is different from anyone else's. I am always cautious about how I behave in public, making sure that I only influence others' emotions for good. When I am in a happy mood, I try to spread positivity and joy around me. If I am feeling sad, I stay away from others, not wanting to burden them with my negative emotions.

At school, the ability to influence emotions has helped me out in some pretty difficult situations. Whenever someone is bullying me or picking on me, I use my ability to make them feel empathetic towards me, and they stop bothering me. It feels great to have this unique power, but it can also be exhausting to always be aware of how others are feeling because of your actions.

At home it's the same; I am always careful with how I interact with my family. If there is ever any tension, I use my power to diffuse the situation, often keeping my family happy and cohesive. These moments give me peace, but they also make me wonder how the family would function without my unique gift. 

The downside to my gift is that it makes it difficult for me to be in relationships. When I'm with someone, it's tough trying to balance being authentic and showing emotions while at the same time, not using my power to manipulate their feelings. This obstacle has made it tough for me to have close and longstanding relationships with anyone. 

On some days, I don't feel like using my gift and would rather be a "normal" person. Iâ€™ll wake up, have breakfast, then get ready for school. During days like this, I'll often avoid or minimize my interactions with people just to see how different my life could be without manipulating the emotions of those around me.

What I have learned over the years is that this power is not a curse. Instead, it is a gift that requires constant balancing. Every day I'm dealing with ethical issues of when, how, or whether to use it. But in the end, my ability can be a tool to help me and others if used with caution.

In all, Although this gift may seem overwhelming, it has helped me become a better person; it has taught me to consider others' feelings, to remain objective and to balance my influence on others. At times, it feels like a heavy weight to carry, but knowing I can help make someone's day better makes it worthwhile.
