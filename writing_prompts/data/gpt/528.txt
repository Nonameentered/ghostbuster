On everyone's 18th birthday at noon, one word appears in their skin, depicting their career or purpose in life. On your birthday you're staring at a clock showing 11:59am, family and friends gathered around for your reveal.
I nervously watched as the second hand ticked closer to noon. My heart was pounding so hard that I feared it might burst out of my chest. My entire family was gathered around me, faces full of excitement and anticipation. They had all received their markings on their 18th birthdays, and I was the last one in my family to come of age. The pressure was intense, and I wished more than anything that I could turn back time and prevent this moment from happening.

At precisely 11:59 am, I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. I wanted to savor the last few seconds of my old life before everything changed, before I knew what my purpose in life would be. When I opened my eyes, I looked down at my arm, where the word was supposed to appear. 

But there was nothing there.

Panic set in as I searched my body for any sign of the word, but there was nothing. My family gasped in shock, and I saw the worry etched on their faces. I was the first person in history to not receive a marking on my 18th birthday.

We spent the next few weeks visiting numerous doctors and specialists, but no one could explain what had happened. I felt lost and hopeless, as if my entire future had been stolen from me. But as I mourned the loss of a certain destiny, I realized that perhaps not having a marking was a sign that my life was meant to be different. I could choose my own path, forge my own destiny. And that was the greatest gift of all.
