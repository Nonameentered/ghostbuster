For the past three days, Salma had been fighting to stay awake. Her eyelids were heavy and her body was exhausted, but she couldn't allow herself to sleep. If she did, someone would die.

It all started when Salma received a mysterious email. The message was cryptic and warned that if Salma were to fall asleep, someone close to her would meet their demise. She tried to brush it off as a hoax but when she saw the name of the sender, a jolt of fear shot through her.

The sender was someone she had known long ago, someone who had changed her life forever, and not for the better. Salma never spoke of him, she had buried his memory deep within her mind and tried her best to forget his existence. But clearly, he still remembered her.

As the night turned to day, Salma's mind grew foggy and her vision blurred. She had tried everything to stay awake; coffee, energy drinks, brief walks around the room, but nothing seemed to work for long. As her exhaustion worsened, so did her anxiety. She had no idea what the sender was planning or who the victim would be. Every sound, every shadow, had her on edge.

By day three, Salma had become a shell of her former self. She couldn't remember the last time she ate or drank anything. The only thing that kept her going was the fear of what would happen if she slept. Her phone had become her lifeline, she constantly searched for clues or messages from the sender. But none came.

As the sun started to set on the third day, Salma's mind was slipping away from her. Her thoughts were jumbled and her body was weak. In a moment of desperation, she decided to call her closest friends and family. She needed their support, but most importantly, she needed them to stay vigilant. She told them about the email, about the possibility of someone close to them being in danger. She begged them to stay awake and to keep an eye out for any suspicious activity.

That night, Salma's apartment was filled with the sounds of her loved ones talking, laughing, and playing games. They sat around her, trying their best to keep her spirits up, to make her feel safe. But as the hours ticked by, their eyes began to droop and their energy levels waned.

Salma watched as each one of them would rest their head on the couch or drift off for just a few seconds. Each time they did, Salma's fear grew. She knew that if one of them slipped into sleep, the consequences would be dire.

As dawn broke on the fourth day, Salma's eyelids were heavy and her mind was slipping away from her. She fought with every fiber of her being to stay awake but her exhaustion was too great. She watched as her friends and family slowly closed their eyes and drifted off to sleep. She tried to scream out to them, to beg them to wake up, but her voice was lost to the void.

When Salma woke up, it was to the sound of police sirens. She was disoriented and in a haze; it took her a few moments to piece together what had happened. One of her closest friends, who had fallen asleep on her watch, had been the victim. He had been taken from the apartment in the middle of the night, his body found in an abandoned building across town.

Salma knew that she had failed. She had tried her best to stay awake, but in the end, it wasn't enough. She had lost someone who mattered dearly to her and would carry that guilt with her for the rest of her life. The memory of that fear, of that email, would never leave her.
