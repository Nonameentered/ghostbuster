Magic exist. But apparently to cast a spell, you have to beatbox
Once upon a time in a faraway land, there lived a wizard named Beat. Beat was known throughout the land as the most powerful wizard, but there was a catch to his magic. To cast any spell, Beat had to beatbox while waving his wand. It was a strange requirement, but Beat had mastered the art of beatboxing from a young age, and no one had ever seen magic performed like this before.

One day, an evil sorcerer threatened the kingdom, and the king called upon Beat to save them. Beat knew what he had to do, and he started beatboxing loudly. The sorcerer was caught off guard by the peculiar sight, but before he could react, Beat had used his magic to create a massive wave of sound which knocked the sorcerer off his feet.

The kingdom rejoiced, and Beat had won the hearts of the people. From that day on, Beat became the official court wizard, and his beatboxing magic became the norm. People lined up with different requests, and Beat never let anyone down. The kingdom flourished, and Beat's fame spread far and wide, making him the most respected wizard in the land.

In the end, it was evident that Beat's wizardry was not only unique but powerful. His beatboxing not only amused but also awed people, and the legacy of his magic and talent lived on long after his time.
