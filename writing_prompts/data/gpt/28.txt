It's the future and we've been colonizing space for some time now. People quickly realize that with such long distances democracy doesn't really work. So, a set of exceptional children are trained since adolescence so one may be chosen as the Dictator. You're one of those kids.
I never asked for this life, but it's the only one I've ever known. Since I was just thirteen years old, I've been training for the role of Dictator. It's a weighty responsibility, one that I don't know if I'll ever be ready for, but it's a fact of life in the society I was born into.

In the early days of our colonization efforts, democracy worked just fine. But as we ventured further from Earth and established colonies on planets with vastly different environments and cultures, it quickly became clear that a more centralized system of governance was needed. The Council of Elders established the role of Dictator, a person chosen from among the most exceptional children in our society, to lead us forward into an uncertain future.

That's where I come in. Along with a handful of other kids, I was plucked from relative obscurity and whisked away to a secret facility where we were put through rigorous physical and mental training. We were taught politics, diplomacy, economics, and military strategy, all with the aim of preparing us for the ultimate leadership role.

It's been tough, I won't lie. There have been moments where I thought I couldn't go on, where the pressure seemed too much to bear. But somehow, I've made it this far. Now, as I approach my eighteenth birthday, the time is drawing near for the final selection process.

There can only be one Dictator, and the competition among us is fierce. We've all become close friends, but we all know that only one of us can win. It's a strange feeling, knowing that you're competing against people you care about deeply. But at the same time, we all understand the importance of what's at stake.

The tests we'll undergo in the coming weeks will be grueling. Physical, mental, and emotional challenges that will push us to our limits and beyond. But we all know that this is only the beginning. If we're chosen as Dictator, our lives will never be the same again. We'll carry the weight of an entire society on our shoulders, and every decision we make will have consequences that ripple through time and space.

I often wonder if I'm cut out for this role. Am I really exceptional enough? Do I have what it takes to lead an entire society into the unknown? But then I remember the people I've met in my life, the friends who've supported me, the mentors who've believed in me. And I know that I'm not alone in this. Whether I become Dictator or not, I'll always have people who care about me, who want me to succeed.

As the day of the final selection approaches, I can feel my nerves jangling. I try to distract myself with training and studying, but my mind always drifts back to that single, all-important question: will it be me? Will I be the one to rise to the challenge and lead us into a brighter tomorrow?

It's impossible to know for sure. But I'm ready to find out. Whatever happens, I'll give it my all. That's all anyone can ask for, really. A chance to prove themselves, a moment to shine. And who knows? Maybe, just maybe, I'll surprise even myself with what I'm capable of. After all, stranger things have happened in space...
