I never thought I’d end up working at Area 51. It was supposed to be a rumor, a conspiracy theory, a myth. But here I am, living and breathing it every day.

My job is to keep the security cameras on and monitor any suspicious activity. It’s a high pressure job, but I’m used to it. What I’m not used to is the stuff I see on those cameras. Weird, unexplainable things happening in the middle of the night. Things that make the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Things that I know I can never tell anyone about.

The secrecy here is insane. I’m not even allowed to tell my family where I work. And I’m constantly reminded of the importance of keeping my mouth shut. It’s like a scene out of a spy movie.

But despite all the oddities, I’m grateful for this job. It pays well, and it’s secure. Plus, there’s a sense of pride that comes with knowing you’re part of something bigger than yourself. Something that could potentially change the world.

So I’ll continue to monitor those cameras, and keep quiet about what I see. Because that’s what it takes to work at Area 51.
