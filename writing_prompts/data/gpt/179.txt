The last person on Earth stood atop a skyscraper, gazing out at the vast, empty world below. They let out a heavy sigh and turned their attention to the task at hand.

It was time to turn off the lights before they left.

The person had spent the last several months wandering through abandoned cities, soaking in the eerie silence that had settled over the planet. They had found no other living beings, and had come to the realization that they truly were the last person left.

As they flipped the switch, plunging the city into darkness, the person couldn't help but feel a twinge of sadness. They were leaving behind a world that had been their home for their entire life, even if it was only briefly. 

But there was a sense of finality in this act. It was time to move on and let go. As they made their way back down the staircase, the person knew that they had turned off the lights, and that they had left the planet in darkness.
