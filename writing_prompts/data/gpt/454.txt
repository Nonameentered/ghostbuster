The meek have inherited the Earth.
It was a strange time. A time where strength had failed and meekness had triumphed. Wars had weakened humanity to a point of no return. The skies were dark and the air was heavy. The Earth had been ravaged, and it was left to the few resilient to rebuild. 

The meek had inherited the Earth, and they weren't the kind to be aggressive about their newfound control. They understood that strength brought discord, and that the only way to true peace was through cooperation. They would no longer be plagued by the misdeeds of the past, and they had a new outlook on life. A life that was to be lived for the betterment of all. 

Gone were the days of the aggressive, the warlords and the dictators. The meek took the time to reflect on how humanity had reached the brink of destruction. Through this self-reflection came the understanding that they could not make the same mistakes again. 

As time went by, the world began to flourish. Crops grew, and food became abundant. Housing was affordable, and communities thrived. Resources were shared, and the needs of the many were put first. 

The meek had not only inherited the Earth, but they had changed it. The world had become a better place, and without the ostentatiousness and the power-hungry, it was finally at peace. The meek had finally inherited their just reward, and they had transformed the very essence of humanity.
