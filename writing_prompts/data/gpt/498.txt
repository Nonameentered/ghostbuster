I woke up, groggy from the sudden interruption of my deep slumber. My eyes struggled to adjust to the early morning light that was filtering through the windows. As I rubbed the sleep from my eyes, my gaze fell to the foot of my bed, and I froze in horror.

Sitting there amidst the blankets was the figure of the devil. He was staring right at me, his fiery eyes boring into my own. My heart pounded in my chest, and I scrambled out of bed, backing up against the wall.

As I tried to scream, the devil tapped my foot and said in his deep, ominous voice, "You're it."

I stood there, shivering, as he disintegrated into thin air, leaving behind a lingering aura of sulfur.

At first, I thought it was all a dream, but as I looked around my room, I could still smell the pungent scent of brimstone, and my skin was tingling where the devil had touched me. Goosebumps ran down my arms, and I suddenly felt a sense of dread.

I didn't know where the devil had gone or what he meant by 'you're it,' but I knew that I needed to take action.

I quickly searched my room for any signs of the devil's presence, but there was no evidence of his visit. However, I couldn't shake the feeling that he was still watching me, lurking in the shadows.

As the day went on, strange occurrences began happening around me. Objects would move on their own, doors would creak open and slam shut, and the temperature in the room would suddenly drop.

It was clear to me that the devil was still present, and I was his target. As I tried to make sense of what was happening, I realized that I needed to outsmart him.

With some research, I reveled that the devil was playing a game of tag. Once he tags someone, the person becomes the devil, and he is released from his obligations of serving the devil. I had to continue the chain to ensure that the devil will be trapped forever. 

I quickly found someone and said, "you're it," as I quickly vanished into oblivion, making sure that the devil will never recover from the lost game.
