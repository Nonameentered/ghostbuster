Stumbling out of bed and into the shower, your eyes adjust to the darkness. You realize the water coming out isn't clear, but crimson red.
It was an average Tuesday morning. The birds were just beginning to chirp, and the sun had yet to rise over the horizon. I stumbled out of bed and into the bathroom. I turned on the shower, and as the water began to heat up, I idly brushed my teeth. I stripped down and stepped into the shower stall, but something was different. The water coming out of the showerhead wasn't clear; it was crimson red.

I shot back in alarm and quickly turned off the shower, heart pounding in my chest. I heard the pitter-patter of the water continuing to flow and looked in shock as blood dripped down from the ceiling into the showerhead. I wretched, the smell of blood overpowering everything else.

In a panic, I quickly got dressed and left my apartment to find out what was going on. I walked out of my complex and saw an unusual amount of police activity. There were yellow caution tape and cruisers everywhere, and a small throng of people huddled together pointing up into the sky. I pushed my way through the crowd, my mind still reeling from the shower.

"People are dying; we don't know why or how, but it's happening!" one man shouted.

I was horrified, and my mind jumped to the worst conclusion. I remembered when the same thing happened a few years ago when there was a break-out of E. coli in the water supply, and people began to panic and hoard anything drinkable.

As I walked further down the street, I noticed there was a line forming in front of the local health clinic. Everyone was there to check themselves for the same thing that I was thinking, and the urgency was palpable.

I boarded a packed subway car, and the reality of the situation began to hit me. Fear and panic were spreading like wildfire, everyone struggling to find something to hang onto. The streets of the city were filled with growing unrest and chaos.

I turned on the local news for any updates and saw the footage of the devastation. It was as though everything was falling apart; the hospitals were overflowing, bodies were piling up. I realised that this wasn't going to be over anytime soon. This was a crisis, something that would change the world forever.

I couldn't shake the feeling that I had to do something to help. I made my way to the local clinic where I took a number and waited my turn. The nurse came out and led me to a room where she drew some blood and sent it off to be tested. I waited anxiously in the room for what seemed like hours, but I knew that it was essential to know what was happening inside me.

After what seemed like an eternity, the nurse came back into the room with a stern look on her face. I braced myself for the worst.

"Your test results came back positive," she said grimly.

My heart sank. I had hoped it was something else, anything else, but it wasn't. I had contracted the virus, and I was now officially a part of the problem.

I left the clinic, a sense of dread creeping in. I didn't know what to do now. I couldn't go home, I couldn't go to work, and I couldn't be around other people. I was an outcast, and I felt the weight of the world on my shoulders.

I found a small park where I could be alone to collect my thoughts. I felt lost and alone, the severity of the situation hitting me all at once. I knew that I had to do something, anything, to help those around me. I just couldn't sit idly by and watch the world crumble.

As night fell, things grew worse. There was a curfew in place, but the streets were still filled with people. Riots broke out and the police were using tear gas to disperse the crowds. I knew that if I stayed out here any longer, I wouldn't make it through the night.

I made my way back home, my heart thumping in my chest. I realised that I was lucky to have a home when so many others were homeless and wandering the streets. I hatched a plan in my mind to help those around me.

I knew that I would have to be careful. I donned gloves and a face mask, trying not to draw attention to myself. I ventured outside and began to help people. I went door to door offering food, water, and medical supplies. I was careful, not telling anyone I was sick or that I was the one who had been going around, but I felt better, knowing that I was doing something to make a difference.

Every day, I would venture out and help people. Things were still bleak, but there were signs of hope. The news began to report that the virus was stabilising, and it seemed like there was finally a light at the end of the tunnel.

One day, I went to visit my friend, Shane. When I arrived, he said that he knew I was the one going around helping people. At first, I was nervous, but he thanked me. He said that I inspired him to help too. We worked side by side, and eventually, other volunteers joined us.

Days, weeks and months passed. Eventually, there was a treatment for the virus, and things began to look up. There was no denying that we had been through something major, but we had come out on the other side stronger.

As I stand on the balcony of my apartment, looking out over the city, I realise that this pandemic has changed the world forever. But the resilience of humanity, and the power of people helping each other, gave us all hope.

I thought back to that morning when I stumbled out of bed and into the shower, my eyes adjusting to the darkness. Water that came out wasn't clear, but crimson red. That moment was a turning point, a moment when my life changed. Looking back now, I realised that it wasn't the only thing that had changed. The world had changed, but we had survived it, together.
