I sat in my usual spot in the church pew, my eyes fixed on the altar at the front of the building. Everyone around me was solemn and pious, bowing their heads and praying silently. I was there for the same reason, seeking guidance and comfort from a higher power.

The time came for the ‘Blood of Jesus’ ritual, where churchgoers would partake in a small sip of wine or grape juice to represent the blood of Christ. I took my cup, raised it to my lips, and drank the liquid down in one gulp. But as soon as it hit my tongue, I knew something was wrong.

The taste was bitter and strange, unlike any grape juice I had ever had before. Within moments, my head started to spin and the world around me began to swirl. The walls of the church seemed to be closing in on me, suffocating me with their heavy presence.

I stumbled out of my seat and fell into the aisle, gasping for air. I looked around, and to my horror, realized that I wasn't the only one affected. People were screaming and thrashing around in their seats, muttering incomprehensible things and foaming at the mouth.

I tried to make my way to the door, but the mass of shaking bodies made it impossible to move. Panic set in as the effects of the drug intensified, wrapping its tendrils around my mind and pulling me under. My thoughts became jumbled and chaotic, and I no longer knew what was real and what wasn't.

As I lay on the floor, feeling my consciousness slipping away, I saw the pastor, who had administered the ‘Blood of Jesus’ himself, standing at the altar with a sinister grin on his face. He had done this intentionally. I couldn't believe it.

I tried to scream, to warn the others, but my voice was lost in the chaos. I closed my eyes and prayed for help, for a way out of this nightmare.

Hours later, I awoke in a hospital bed, surrounded by anxious-looking doctors and nurses. They told me I had suffered a severe reaction to a new drug that had been spiked into the ‘Blood of Jesus’ wine. Several people had died, but somehow I had made it through.

I left the hospital a changed person, forever scarred by the horror of that night. I no longer trusted easily, and my faith had been shaken to its core. I could only pray that God would show mercy on those who had done this, and bring justice to those who deserved it.
