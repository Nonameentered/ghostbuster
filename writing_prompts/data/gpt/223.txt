You can move freely through time, but are incapable of moving through space
I am a time traveler, but not in the traditional sense. I can move freely through time, but I am incapable of moving through space. It’s like being trapped in a bubble that is always tethered to the same spot.

I’ve been around for a long time, watching the world change and evolve. I’ve seen empires rise and fall, wars rage, and great minds come and go. But I’ve always been stuck in the same place, unable to explore new territories.

It’s a lonely existence, but it has its perks. I can revisit my favorite moments in history, see my loved ones again, and witness world events without fear of danger or harm. But as I watch time roll on from my bubble, I can’t help but feel a pang of jealousy for those who can move freely through space.

I’ve seen explorers brave treacherous seas and climb towering mountains, adventurers who’ve traversed deserts and forests. I’ve seen people travel to the furthest corners of the earth and beyond, to explore the depths of oceans and the vastness of space.

I long to join them, to feel the wind in my hair and touch the earth with my feet. But alas, I am trapped in my bubble, a prisoner of my own curious mind.

Perhaps one day science will find a way to unlock me from this prison, to let me explore the world like everyone else. Until then, I will continue to watch the world from afar, a silent observer trapped in time.

But who knows, maybe one day I’ll find solace in my unique situation, and learn to appreciate the world from my own perspective. Because after all, everyone’s journey is different.
