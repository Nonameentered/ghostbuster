You appear in a small dark room. In the middle of it there is a table, a computer terminal on it and an uncomfortable looking stool. The screen blinks. nยบ 47525961285641377 'I wish I could be less fat.' Allow? [y/N] | This is your life now.
As I blinked and tried to adjust to the dim lighting, I couldn't help but feel a sense of overwhelming confusion. How did I end up in this small, dark room? And what was the significance of the blinking computer terminal?

I slowly approached the table, feeling a wave of discontent as my eyes landed on the uncomfortable stool. What was going on? Was this some sort of twisted prank?

As I stood there, lost in thought, the screen flashed once again - presenting me with a bizarre message that read "I wish I could be less fat. Allow? [y/N]". It took me a few moments to fully comprehend the prompt before I hesitantly chose "y".

Suddenly, the entire room seemed to shift and morph, leaving me with the realization that this was my life now - a life that I alone held the power to change. With newfound determination, I vowed to make the most of this strange situation and turn my life around.
