A nuclear war has decimated most of the globe, Great Britain included. A survivor treks through the Midlands, England, on his way to the South Coast, looking for a treasure, long since lost.
The world had ended, and it had done so with a thunderous roar. The bombs had exploded, tearing apart entire cities and people. The radio waves were silent, only static encroached on the airways, and the night's glow was not the stars but the radioactive fallout. Many had died, and those who survived were left to pick up the ruins of civilization as the world had known.

The survivor had fled the chaos. The Midlands bordered the North West, and it was now a desolate wasteland. The empty streets and the destroyed buildings had become familiar as he trudged down the road. He hadn't seen a soul for weeks. An old, rusted bicycle was his only companion. It was his mode of transport and his lifeline. As he trekked down the countryside, images of his past flashed in his mind. He saw his wife's smile, his children playing, and the green fields of England. Now the fields were all gone, and the sky looked menacing all day, every day.

As he cycled through a town, Hinton, he saw a signpost pointing to a South Coast beach named Rye Harbour. He had heard of the treasure, a gold locket, and wondered if it was still there, a century later. It had belonged to a woman who had fled with her family long ago, leaving everything behindâ€” the trinket had been the only thing to remember their old life. The survivor thought it was worth enough to exchange for a good life. With renewed hope, he cycled towards Rye Harbour.

Days went by as he cycled by abandoned fields and towns. Every day, the ride became harder, and the air felt thinner.  As he neared his destination, he realized he might have made a fatal mistake. He had not prepared adequately and brought enough supplies. What little food he had was running out, and he had not seen any edible source for days. The radiation was stronger too, about three hundred rads, making the air unbreathable and the sky hazy.

But he could not turn back now. The hope of the treasure and the new life it promised kept him going. The roads were rugged, and the sun was blistering, but he persevered. He knew his destination was not far, and with sheer will, he cycled, with lips cracked and dried with thirst, stopping only for a sip of water from stagnant swamps.

On the fifth day of his journey, he reached the coast. It took him by surprise as he saw the serene waves lapping at the sandy shore. The beach was empty, but he could see a broken down structure in the distance.

As he approached, he realized that it was a small wooden cabin. He cycled towards it, his heart beating with anxiety and anticipation. The cabin's door was open, and he stepped in, looking for the treasure.

Inside was dark and damp. His footsteps echoed in the silence until a creaking sound behind him made him spin around. It was just an old cabinet. He continued searching, scouring through the box, under the loose floorboards and in the cobwebbed corners. He found nothing. The treasure was gone. All his dreams and hopes had shattered in that one moment.

He sat there, resentful and hopeless. The radioactive air had pulled on his lungs, and he coughed out blood. He was too weak to cycle back, and he knew he was dying. He thought of his family, his wife, and children whom he would never see again. The world had ended, and there was nothing more for him here.

As he lay there, he realized he had been wrong. His search for treasure had blinded him to the beauty around him. The waves crashed against the shore like music, and the sun glowed a deep orange, reflecting on the sea. The world might be destroyed, but the treasures of nature still remained.

He died there, content in his realization and surrounded by beauty. He would never know that the golden locket had been found years before, picked up by someone else and cherished for its lost story.

As the days turned to years and the years to centuries, the survivors that emerged rebuilt society. They built structures, farms, and technology that helped them tame the radioactive wasteland. The beaches began to teem with life, and the waves no longer kept secrets. The beauty that had gone unnoticed by the survivor was now cherished and preserved.

As time went on, and the world returned to a semblance of what it had been before, those who remembered the stories of the old survivor walked by Rye Harbour, that silent and once placid beach which had held the dreams of a man. And they whispered, "What a fool he was for not seeing the treasure that had been around him all along."
