You wake up one morning, and it feels like several years have passed, despite all the evidence to the contrary.
I woke up one morning and something felt off. It was like I had been asleep for years, but everything around me was exactly the same. The same worn-out sheets were tangled around my legs, and the same sunlight filtered in through the same threadbare curtains. I rubbed my eyes and sat up, trying to shake the feeling of disorientation that had settled in my chest. 

I stumbled to the bathroom and flicked on the light, wincing at the sudden brightness. I stared at myself in the mirror, taking in my tired eyes and the way my hair stuck up in all directions. I looked exactly the same as I had the day before, the week before, the month before. But something wasn't right. I couldn't shake the feeling that time had somehow passed me by while I had been sleeping. 

I stumbled out of the bathroom and made my way to the kitchen, my feet heavy and my heart racing. Maybe the answer was in a cup of coffee, in the warmth of the mug and the bitterness of the brew. But when I opened the cabinet, I saw the same mugs and the same coffee filters as always. Nothing had changed. 

I tried to shake off the feeling and went to check my phone. Maybe I had overslept, and everyone had moved on without me. But when I unlocked the screen, I saw messages from just yesterday, and the day before that, and the day before that. Nothing had changed. 

I tried to go through the motions of my day, but everything felt different. The sun seemed brighter, the sounds of the city muffled and distant. Even the air tasted different, somehow stale and unfamiliar. But despite all of that, the world around me went on as usual. The same cars honked outside, the same people chatted on the street corners. It was like I was in a bubble of time that no one else knew about. 

I tried to talk to my friends and family about it, but they just looked at me like I was crazy. "What do you mean, you feel like years have passed?" They asked. "Nothing has changed." 

But something had. I could feel it in the way my bones seemed creakier, the way my skin seemed to sag just a little bit more. I watched as my plants grew taller, my books grew thicker. It wasn't time passing at its usual rate, but it was passing nonetheless. 

I spent days, then weeks, trying to get to the bottom of it. I went to the doctor, who told me that I was perfectly healthy. I went to a psychic, who told me that I was experiencing a time warp. I went to every corner of the city, searching for some sort of clue or explanation. 

It wasn't until I stumbled upon a strange old man in a park that things finally started to make sense. He was sitting on a bench, staring off into the distance, and he looked like he had been there for years. When I approached him, he turned to me with eyes that sparkled with understanding. "You feel it too, don't you?" He said. "The passing of time, but not in the way it's supposed to?" 

I nodded, my heart pounding in my chest. "What is it?" I asked. 

He smiled knowingly. "Some people are just meant to experience time in a different way," he said. "To live it slower, to taste it sweeter. But you have to be careful, because not everyone is meant to understand it. You might drive yourself mad trying to make others see what you see." 

He stood up to leave, and I reached out to grab his hand. "Wait," I said. "What do I do?" 

He looked back at me, his eyes kind. "Live every moment like it's the only one you'll get," he said. "Because maybe, for you, it is." 

And so, I went back to my life, slowly but surely accepting my new reality. I still feel like time is passing differently for me, but it doesn't scare me anymore. Instead, I try to savor every second, to hold onto it as tightly as I can. Because maybe, just maybe, the old man was right. Maybe I only have this one chance to experience life in this way, to see the world in this light. And I don't want to waste a single moment.
