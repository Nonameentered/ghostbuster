I had just finished a long day of work and was driving home when I suddenly lost control of my car. I swerved left and then right, narrowly missing multiple cars on the road. With a sharp turn, my car was headed straight off the road towards a tree. With seconds to spare, I threw my hands in the air and shouted, "Jesus take the wheel!"

Suddenly, there was a blinding white light. When the light faded, I found myself sitting in the passenger seat of my car. It was still moving, but I wasn't driving anymore. I looked over at the driver's seat to see a tall, thin man with a bushy beard and long hair. He had a serene expression on his face and was wearing a simple white robe.

Frustrated and confused, I demanded to know who was driving my car. The man turned to me and spoke in a calm, reassuring voice, "Don't worry, my child. I've got this."

I realized that I wasn't actually hurt or injured. The car was driving smoothly, and we arrived at my home without any further incidents. As I got out of the car, the man turned to me and said, "Remember, I'm always with you."

And then he was gone. It was only then that I realized who had been driving my car. It wasn't Jesus, but it had been an angel sent to protect me. From that day on, I knew that I would never have to fear serious accidents again because my guardian angel would always be watching over me.
