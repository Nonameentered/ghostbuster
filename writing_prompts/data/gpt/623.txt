You wake up to discover that you have gained two powers: Call, and Seal.
I woke up feeling different. Something was off, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. That's when I noticed it. My hands were glowing. I stared at them, completely mesmerized by the light emanating from them. Suddenly, I could feel something inside of me stirring. It was like a power that had always been there, waiting to be unlocked. And in that moment, it was.

I soon discovered that I had two powers- Call and Seal. With Call, I could summon anything I wanted at will. With Seal, I could lock anything away, keeping it hidden from the rest of the world.

At first, I was excited. I conjured up all sorts of things- money, cars, even a private jet. It was exhilarating to know that I possessed this kind of power. But as time went on, I began to realize the implications of my newfound abilities. I had the ability to attract attention, both good and bad.

One day, I used my Seal power to lock away a group of criminals who were threatening my city. The act was met with gratitude from the citizens, and I began to feel like a hero. But as I walked home, I was followed by a mysterious man. He claimed to know about my powers and offered me a deal- to use my Call power to summon an item from a museum for him, in exchange for a large sum of money.

I refused, of course. But the encounter left me uneasy. What other people knew about my powers? How would they use them to their advantage? I never asked for any of this. It was like a burden I had to bear, and I didn't know if I could handle it.

But there was one person who understood- my best friend. She was at first shocked, but soon her curiosity took over. She would ask me to summon cute animals or household items, just for the fun of it. But she also understood the weight of my powers, and promised to keep them a secret.

And so, I continue to live my life, balancing my newfound abilities with the responsibility that comes with them. They may not be a gift, but with the right mindset, they can be a powerful tool for good.
