Everyone in the world is colorblind until they meet/touch their soulmate; you meet a random stranger and everything becomes colorful, but the stranger just stares at you, confused.
I always thought the world was dull. Colors never quite popped and everything was always in shades of gray. It was like living in a black and white movie, with no possibility of seeing the colors in vibrant beauty. People always looked the same to me, and it was hard to tell one person from the other based on how they looked. My life was a simple one, with the only joy coming from the occasional time I spent in a garden, watching the vivid colors that flowers provided. It was here where I met her. At first, I thought she was just another person, but then she smiled and touched my hand I saw everything in a brand new light. The colors around me exploded into a kaleidoscope and my wold suddenly became a lot more lively.

As I looked around me, people were no longer gray figures passing by. They were lively and dynamic characters, each one unique and individual. It was daunting at first, as my eyes struggled to cope with the sudden influx of all the new colors, but I quickly adjusted. Everywhere I looked, the world was full of vibrancy and life. I glanced over at the stranger and saw her looking at me, confusion etched across her face.

I must have looked crazy, standing there in the middle of the gardens with my eyes wide open, taking in everything that was around me. I was lost in the moment, watching as the colors danced before me in a beautiful display. With every passing second, I felt more alive than ever before.

But then, I looked over at the stranger again and saw a look of bewilderment on her face. She didn't seem to be seeing what I was seeing. I looked at her incredulously, wondering why she couldn't see all the colors. I pointed at the flowers that were blooming to my right and tried to communicate to her that they were simply bursting with color and life. But she didn't seem to understand.

It was then that I realized that she must not be my soulmate. According to the stories, every time you met your soulmate, everything in the world was supposed to be filled with colors. And yet, this stranger didn't seem to see any of it. What was even more perplexing was that she didn't even seem to care about the blooming flowers or even the shades of the leaves rustling in the breeze. It was like she was completely immune to the beauty of everything around us.

I couldn't help but feel a sense of loss as I stood there beside her, watching the beauty of the world slowly fade away. All the colors that had filled my vision only a moment ago were now properly tucked away back into their drab, dull existence. It was like my heart had been filled with the beauty of a rose, only to have it snatched away and replaced with thorns.

It was then that I realized that the world was just as dull as it had always been. And I knew then that I had to keep searching. Most people might give up at this point, but I couldn't. The world was too beautiful to give up on finding my soulmate, even if it meant searching for years. If I could see even a glimpse of all the colors that existed, there had to be someone out there that could see them too.
