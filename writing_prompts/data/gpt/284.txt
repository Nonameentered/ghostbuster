An ordinary, 30 year-old human has been immortal since the year 1,014 A.D. Now, he/she is working in corporate America looking back on his/her millennium in existence.
I look back on my life of a millennium and wonder how it all happened, how I became immortal. I was just an ordinary human being, with no special abilities or powers. But in the year 1,014 A.D., I stumbled upon a magical artifact that changed my life forever.

At first, I was excited to have immortality, to see the world change and evolve over centuries. But as the centuries passed, I started to feel alone. I watched my loved ones grow old and die, while I remained the same. It was a curse that I couldn't shake off, so I embraced it.

Throughout the years, I had countless experiences, traveled to different parts of the world and witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations. I've seen wars fought over meaningless things, and people killed for their beliefs.

Now, in 2021, I work in corporate America and see the world as it is today. I see how people value youth and fame over wisdom and knowledge. They have lost touch with the values that once made humanity great.

Looking back, immortality has taught me to appreciate the small things in life, to cherish every moment and every person I encounter. So, as I begin another day in corporate America, I am reminded of my blessings and the lessons immortality has taught me.
