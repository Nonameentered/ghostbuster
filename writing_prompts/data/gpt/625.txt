As a popular Instagram model, I had my fair share of admirers. However, after a strange incident, I began to receive notifications on my phone every time someone masturbates to me. I found it creepy at first, but soon realized that it could be advantageous.

One day, I received a notification from a wealthy businessman who had always ignored my direct messages. I decided to use this knowledge to my advantage and offered him a personalized photoshoot in exchange for a hefty sum of money. He agreed without hesitation.

As time went on, I used these notifications to my advantage and made deals with several wealthy clients. Word eventually got out, and more people began to masturbate to me, leading to a rise in notifications and profits.

While it was strange, I couldn't deny the financial benefits. It just goes to show that sometimes the strangest situations can lead to unexpected opportunities.
