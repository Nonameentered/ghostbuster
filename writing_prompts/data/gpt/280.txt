The witch stole his heart, and replaced it with ice. Now he can not love, lest it melts.
Once upon a time, there was a kind and loving man named John. One day, he met a beautiful witch named Elise, who bewitched and stole his heart. She removed his heart and replaced it with ice, warning him that if he ever loved anyone else or showed any warmth, the ice would melt, and he would die.

Years went by, and John lived his life in misery. He was never able to love or show any emotion, always living with the fear that his heart would melt, and he would die. One day, he met a kind and loving woman named Jane, who saw past the ice and loved John for who he was.

As they spent time together, John's heart began to thaw, and he felt the warmth of love once again. He was overjoyed as he realized that his heart would not melt, and he could love Jane without fear. Together, they lived happily ever after, warming John's heart and melting the frozen heart of the witch who once cursed him.
