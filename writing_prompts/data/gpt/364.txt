My favourite song is "Here Comes the Sun" by The Beatles. There's something about the uplifting melody and positive lyrics that always puts me in a good mood. As I listen to it now, I close my eyes and let my mind wander. 

I imagine myself walking down a country road, the sun shining down on me. The grass is a vibrant green, and wildflowers bloom alongside the path. Birds chirp in the distance, and a gentle breeze blows through my hair. I feel at peace here, like I've escaped the chaos of the world and found a quiet corner of heaven. 

As I walk, I come across a small cottage tucked away in the woods. Smoke curls from the chimney, and I hear music coming from inside. It's the same song I'm listening to - "Here Comes the Sun". I can't help but smile at the coincidence, and I follow the sound of the music to the door. 

Inside, I find a group of people gathered around a fire. They're singing along to the song, their voices blending together in harmony. They welcome me with open arms, and soon I find myself dancing along with them, caught up in the joy of the moment. 

As the song comes to an end, we all collapse onto the floor, breathless and laughing. Someone hands me a mug of hot cocoa, and I look around at my new companions. They're all different ages and backgrounds, but they share a sense of community and love that makes me feel like I belong. 

Over the next few days, I stay with them and learn their stories. There's a retired nurse who volunteers at a local hospital, a teenager who hopes to become a professional dancer, and a couple who run a bed and breakfast nearby. They all have their struggles and worries, but they find strength in each other and the beauty of the world around them. 

We spend our days exploring the countryside, taking long walks through the forest and picnicking by a nearby stream. Nights are spent huddled around the fire, sharing stories and playing music. The world outside these woods fades away, and all that matters is the present moment and the people around me. 

As my time with them comes to an end, I feel a sense of longing. I don't want to leave this haven of peace and joy. But I know that I have to go back into the real world, with all its complications and stresses. 

I say goodbye to my new friends and start the journey back to the city. The world outside the woods is different now, somehow. The colours are duller, the air colder. But this time, I don't feel trapped or alone. I remember the joy and love I found in that cottage, and I know that it's still out there, waiting for me. 

When I get home, I sit down at my desk and start to write. I write about the people I met and the stories they shared. I write about the beauty of the countryside and the warmth of the fire. And as I write, I feel the same sense of peace and joy that I felt in those woods. 

"Here Comes the Sun" plays softly in the background, and I smile. The song may be over, but the memories it sparked will stay with me forever. And I know that whenever I need a little bit of sunshine in my life, all I have to do is close my eyes and let the music take me back to that magical cottage in the woods.
