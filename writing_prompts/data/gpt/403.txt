Randomize your music playlist. Hit Play. Write a funny or scary story based on the title of the song playing.
As soon as Derrick hit play on his randomized music playlist, he knew he was in for a wild ride. The first song that came on was "Thriller" by Michael Jackson. He couldn't help but chuckle at the irony of it all – he had always been a bit of a scaredy-cat, but now he was going to be forced to face his fears with each new song that played.

The next song up was "Monster Mash" by Bobby "Boris" Pickett. Derrick rolled his eyes – this was almost too on the nose. But as the song played on, he realized that it was actually a pretty catchy tune. He found himself tapping his foot and bobbing his head along with the beat.

Just as he was starting to enjoy himself, the next song came on – "I Will Always Love You" by Whitney Houston. Derrick groaned. This was not the mood he wanted to be in right now. He was supposed to be getting scared, damn it! But as Whitney's voice soared over the speakers, he couldn't deny that it was a damn good song.

The fourth song on the playlist was "Don't Fear The Reaper" by Blue Öyster Cult. Finally, a song that fit the theme! Derrick felt a little thrill run down his spine as the haunting guitar riff started up. Maybe this wouldn't be so bad after all.

But then, just as he was really getting into it, the next song started playing – "Baby Shark" by Pinkfong. Derrick's heart sank. This was not scary. This was not even mildly intimidating. This was just...annoying.

He was about to skip to the next song when something strange started happening. As the chorus of "Baby Shark" reached its climax, the room around Derrick started to go dark. The walls and floor began to fade away, leaving him floating in a black void.

And then he saw them – dozens of little baby sharks, their jaws snapping open and closed as they circled around him. It was like something out of a nightmare.

"Derrick," a voice called out to him, and he spun around to see a woman standing there, dressed in a lab coat. "My name is Dr. Strangelove. I'm the scientist in charge of this experiment."

"Experiment? What are you talking about?"

"This is all part of our new virtual reality technology," Dr. Strangelove explained. "We've programmed your playlist to trigger different experiences based on the song titles. We're trying to create a new kind of immersive entertainment experience."

"But why baby sharks?" Derrick asked, still feeling a little rattled from the experience.

"It's all randomized," Dr. Strangelove said with a shrug. "Sometimes the songs don't match up quite right. But don't worry, we're constantly refining the technology so that every experience is as perfect as possible."

Derrick didn't know what to say. It was all so bizarre. But then he heard a new song start playing – "I Want To Hold Your Hand" by The Beatles. He felt something stirring in his chest – could it be...love?

Sure enough, as the song played on, he saw a beautiful woman walking towards him, her hand reaching out to him. He took it eagerly, and they began to dance together in the void.

As The Beatles sang about wanting to hold someone's hand, Derrick realized that he had never really felt like he was missing out on anything. But in that moment, he couldn't deny that he was enjoying himself. Maybe this crazy experiment really was onto something.

And then, just as suddenly as it had all started, the room around him came back into focus. He was standing in the middle of his living room, alone except for his music player.

Derrick couldn't help but laugh at how ridiculous it all was. But even as he shook his head, he felt a newfound sense of excitement. Who knew what strange and wonderful experiences his playlist had in store for him next? All he had to do was hit play and find out.
