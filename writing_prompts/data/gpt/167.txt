It was January 2nd, 2013 and I was determined to stick to my New Year's resolution to quit smoking. I had thrown my cigarettes out and promised myself that I wouldn't give in to the urge to light up again. 

But as the day progressed, I found myself becoming increasingly stressed and anxious. I longed for the calming effect of nicotine and before I knew it, I had given in to my cravings. 

As I took that first drag, I felt both disappointed and relieved. Disappointed that I had failed so quickly, but relieved to have that familiar feeling of satisfaction. 

But as the day wore on, I began to feel guilty and ashamed. I had let myself down and broken a promise to myself. Tomorrow was a new day, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I had already failed. 

Despite my setback, I vowed to continue my journey towards quitting smoking. It wouldn't be easy, but I was determined to succeed.
