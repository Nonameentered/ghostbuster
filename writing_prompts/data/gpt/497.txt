There was a ghost named Fred who had been roaming around the world for centuries. He had been known to target various people and haunt them for years. One day, Fred stumbled upon a young woman named Emily who seemed to be the perfect victim for him. However, he didn't realize that Emily had been haunted regularly since childhood and was tired of it.

Emily had learned to ignore her hauntings and didn't pay any special attention to Fred. She had become desensitized to such occurrences and wanted to live a normal life. This attitude towards him flared Fred's determination to make Emily his victim. He hounded Emily with all his might but she remained unperturbed.

Fred tried every trick in the book to get Emily to acknowledge him, but she remained indifferent. Eventually, he realized that he was not getting any satisfaction haunting Emily and decided to move on. From that day on, Emily felt a sense of relief. Even though she was relieved that Fred had moved on, she decided that it was time to finally put an end to her hauntings for good. The haunted girl took matters into her own hands and finally found a way to shake the ghosts in her life.
