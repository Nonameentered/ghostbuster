A Prophecy foretold that you shall die by suicide. You try your very best to change this fate.
Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Maya. One day, a prophecy foretold that she would die by suicide. Terrified and confused, Maya tried to change this fate.

She went to great lengths to live a happy life and fulfill her dreams. Maya started spending more time with her loved ones, went on long walks and hikes, and even went on a soul-searching journey to find inner peace. She tried anything and everything in her power to break free of the prophecy.

As time passed, Maya became more anxious with the inevitable. She hesitated to do the things she loved the most because she was afraid that each step might bring her closer to her predicted fate.

But despite her efforts to change her destiny, the prophecy still lingered in the back of her mind, and she couldn't escape it.

One night, as Maya sat alone in her room, she started to feel overwhelmed. The thought of dying by suicide haunted her again. The more she tried to ignore it, the more it consumed her.

Maya knew that she needed help because she could no longer bear the burden of this prophecy. She reached out to her friends and family, and together, they explored several options that could help her break free from this spell.

She wrote down positive affirmations, exercised daily, and even started seeing a therapist who taught her how to tackle anxiety and suicidal thoughts. With their help and Maya's resilience, she slowly began to find her footing again.

It took time, but Maya was finally able to overcome her fears and take back control of her life. She realized that the prophecy was not something that she could change, but that didn't mean her fate was sealed.

Maya learned that the power of her mind and her will to survive were stronger than any prophecy. She found the courage to keep moving forward, even in the face of adversity.

Years went by, and Maya was grateful for every moment of her precious life. The prophecy no longer held any power over her. She had won the battle, and she was living proof that one's destiny is not always predetermined.
