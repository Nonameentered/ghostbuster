'We have to leave him behind! He isn't going to make it!'... that was 10 years ago. They didn't think you'd survive. You did. And now it's time they found out.
Ten years ago, I found myself in the middle of a warzone, fighting for my country. My comrades and I were on a mission to retrieve a valuable package from the enemy. The mission started off smoothly, but things quickly went awry. 

As we approached our objective, a booby trap exploded, killing two of our men and injuring several others. One of them, a young soldier named Lucas, had taken the brunt of the explosion. He was bleeding out quickly, and it was clear that we needed to get him medical attention as soon as possible. 

But time was not on our side. We could hear the enemy approaching, and we knew that we needed to move quickly if we were going to make it out alive. We managed to get a few hundred feet away from the explosion when we realized that Lucas was not going to make it. 

"We have to leave him behind! He isn't going to make it!" one of my comrades shouted over the sound of gunfire. It was a difficult decision, but we knew that we had to leave Lucas behind if we wanted to survive. 

As we retreated, I couldn't help but feel guilty for leaving my friend behind. But there was nothing more that we could do. We had to prioritize our survival over everything else. 

After that mission, I was honorably discharged and returned home. But the guilt of leaving Lucas behind haunted me. I couldn't stop thinking about him and what had happened on that battlefield. 

Over the years, I tried to find out what happened to him. But my searches turned up nothing. Until one day, I received a call from an old comrade of mine. He had found Lucas, alive and well. 

I couldn't believe it. After all these years, he was alive. I immediately made plans to go see him. When I arrived, I was shocked to see that Lucas had lost both of his legs due to the injuries he had sustained in the explosion. 

We talked for hours, catching up on each other's lives. And then, I finally mustered up the courage to apologize for leaving him behind. 

But Lucas just smiled and said, "You did what you had to do to survive. And I'm alive today because of it." 

I was overwhelmed with emotion. The guilt that had weighed on me for ten years had been lifted. And I realized that sometimes, survival is the only thing that matters.
