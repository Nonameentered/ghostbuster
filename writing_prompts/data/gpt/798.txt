Every person is born with a timer on their wrist that counts down to when the person meets their soulmate
From the moment I was born, there was a timer on my wrist counting down to the moment when I would meet my soulmate. My parents had tried to hide it from me when I was young, but as I grew up, I became more and more curious about what it meant.

I watched as my friends found their soulmates and their timers ticked down to zero. I saw the joy and happiness that it brought them, and I couldn't wait to experience it for myself. I wondered if I would know when it was going to happen, or if it would be a surprise.

One day, as I was walking down the street, I bumped into someone. I looked up and saw a handsome man with a timer on his wrist that was just a few seconds behind mine. Our eyes met, and I felt a jolt of electricity run through my body. I knew right then and there that he was the one.

We started talking, and I found out that his name was Michael. We had so much in common and it felt like we had known each other forever. As we talked, our timers began to tick down faster and faster until they finally reached zero. We both looked down at our wrists and saw that our timers had disappeared, and it was in that moment that I knew I had found my soulmate.

It's been years since that day, and Michael and I are still happily in love. We've built a life together and have a family of our own. Looking back, I'm grateful for the timer on my wrist that led me to the love of my life. Without it, I might have missed out on the greatest adventure of all.
