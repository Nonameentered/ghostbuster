Samantha had always been a selfless person. She had always put the needs of others above her own. So when Death knocked at her door, she didn't hesitate to speak up when Death asked for her elderly neighbor, Mrs. Johnson.

"Take me instead!" Samantha said firmly.

Death hesitated for a moment before nodding its hooded head. With a wave of its hand, Samantha was drawn into the void and Mrs. Johnson was left standing alone on her front porch.

Samantha found herself in a featureless void, with nothing around her but a lone figure. It was a tall, imposing figure, and Samantha had the feeling that it was Death in a different form.

"You have made a noble sacrifice," the figure said in a booming voice. "I will grant your wish, but there is a catch. All knowledge of your life and circumstances will be erased from everyone's memory. No one will remember you or the sacrifice you made today."

Samantha thought for a moment before nodding. "I understand. I don't need recognition for doing what is right. It's enough to know that I helped someone in need."

The figure nodded and raised its arms. Suddenly, Samantha felt a strange sensation wash over her, and everything went black.

When she opened her eyes, Samantha found herself sitting in a hospital bed. She had no idea how she got there or what had happened to her. As she looked around, she saw her mother sitting beside her, tears streaming down her face.

"Mom, what's wrong?" she asked, confused.

"Samantha!" her mother exclaimed, pulling her into a tight hug. "Oh, thank God you're okay!"

Samantha was even more confused now. "What happened? Why am I in the hospital?"

Her mother took a deep breath and explained that Samantha had been in a terrible car accident. She had been in a coma for weeks and doctors weren't sure if she would ever wake up. But miraculously, Samantha had regained consciousness.

As Samantha listened to her mother's words, she had a strange feeling that she was missing something important. But no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't remember what it was. All she knew was that she was alive, and that was enough for her.
