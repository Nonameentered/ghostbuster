After no contact from outer space, NASA finally receives an Alien radio signal with only 7 words: 'The birds are not what they seem'
NASA had been sending out radio signals into outer space for years, hoping to make contact with extraterrestrial life. They had never received any response, until one day, the unexpected happened.

The scientists at the NASA space center were sitting at their desks when they received a bizarre signal. The speakers echoed loud static before a voice spoke. "The birds are not what they seem," it said in a hushed whisper. The voice spoke slowly and deliberately, as if every word was carefully selected.

The NASA team was stunned. They scrambled to understand the message and its meaning. They spent hours pouring over the signal, analyzing it in every possible way, but nothing stood out.

Was this an omen of some kind? A cryptic message from an alien race that had yet to be understood? The team was left to wonder, waiting anxiously for their next contact from outer space. One thing was sure, from that day on, they would have to look at the birds differently.
