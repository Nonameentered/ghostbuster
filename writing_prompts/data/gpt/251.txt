You teach Basic Undead Lore at the Arcane University, so your class is at the same time composed of freshmen necromancers, paladins, warlocks and witch hunters
As a professor at the Arcane University, I was in charge of teaching Basic Undead Lore to a diverse group of freshmen. The class was composed of necromancers, paladins, warlocks, and witch hunters. It was a challenging task, to say the least, but I was thrilled to be able to impart my knowledge to such a varied group of students.

On the first day of class, I tried to set the tone for what was to come. I explained the importance of understanding basic undead lore, telling them that without it, they were leaving themselves vulnerable to some of the most dangerous creatures in the world.

The necromancers in the class seemed eager to learn everything they could about the undead, as if they already had some familiarity with the creatures. I could see in their eyes the desire to master the skills they needed to raise and command an army of the dead. They were the easiest to teach, as they already had a base understanding of the subject matter.

The paladins, though few in the class, were the most skeptical. They saw any interaction with the undead as a perversion of nature, something that should never be attempted, and my class as an encroachment upon their beliefs. I spent a considerable amount of time trying to convince them that understanding the ways of the undead was essential to defeating them, but it was a challenge.

The warlocks were intrigued by the subject matter, but in a different way than the necromancers. They wanted to know how the undead could be used as a tool for personal gain; they were interested in learning how to harness their power for their own purposes.

And then there were the witch hunters. These students were the ones I found most challenging to teach. They came into the classroom with a chip on their shoulders, already convinced that anything to do with the undead was a waste of time. They believed that the only way to deal with the undead was to destroy them, not to understand them. But I was determined to change their minds.

Over the course of the semester, we covered everything from the basics of undead anatomy to advanced techniques for battling them. We talked about the different types of undead and how to recognize them, as well as how to create and command them.

But the lessons weren't just about learning the fundamentals of the undead. I made it a point to teach my students about the ethical implications of their actions, and how their decisions could impact the world around them. We discussed the consequences of raising the dead, and the dangers of using the undead as a weapon.

One of the most interesting aspects of the class was seeing the students interact with each other. The necromancers and warlocks would frequently share notes and ideas, exchanging knowledge and tips on how to enhance their abilities. The paladins, though still wary of the subject matter, became more open-minded as the semester progressed, and eventually found common ground with some of the other students.

The witch hunters were the most stoic of the group. They rarely spoke, but their presence was felt in the classroom. Little did I know, they were observing everything we did in class, taking notes, drawing pictures and making connections between the information. One day, one of them raised their hand and asked me a question that surprised everyone in the room.

"Professor," she said, "In one of the notes you created, there's a connection between the seven ancient kings and the creation of vampires. Can I know more about that?"

For a moment, I was stunned. As a professor, rarely does someone sparks my interest in such a way because I'm used to teaching the same matter over and over. And then, it clicked. I explained that the seven ancient kings were the most powerful necromancers who ever lived, and that it was believed that they were responsible for creating the first vampire. The witch hunter student started to connect the dots, and pointed out that some people believe that these kings still exist and are very much alive, and that they were not true necromancers, but rather a race of beings that possess the power but lack the moral compass.

I was impressed. Not only did I realize the witch hunters were taking the time to learn the material, but they were also using this knowledge on their craft. From that day on, the witch hunter student started to question all theories and practices, she was the one who steered the class to research deeper app actions and occult knowledge.

As the class drew to a close, I realized that my students had grown immensely. They had taken what they learned and used it to form their own opinions and beliefs about the undead. They may have come from different backgrounds, but they had all come to a deeper understanding of the subject matter.

The freshmen had left the class with a fascination for the undead, but with a respect for them and what they represent. And, I am proud to be the one who taught them.
