The Zombie apocalypse arrived. The zombies live forever, don't care about social rules, sleep around a lot and generally have more fun. People are rushing to become zombies.
The world as we knew it had come to an end. The apocalypse had arrived, but it wasn't like any other apocalypse that we had ever imagined. The undead had risen, and they were here to stay. The zombies had arrived.

At first, people were scared. They locked themselves in their homes, hoping to avoid the zombies at all costs. We thought that the undead were here to kill us, to eat our brains and turn us into one of them. But, as time passed, we began to realize something strange. The zombies seemed to be having more fun than we were.

The zombies didn't care about social rules. They did whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted. They would dance in the streets, sing at the top of their lungs, and even have sex in public. They were having a blast, and we were all missing out.

People began to change their minds about the zombies. They wanted to be like them. They wanted to be free of the rules and restrictions that had bound us for so long. They wanted to be able to have fun, to enjoy life, without worrying about what society thought.

Soon, people began to rush to become zombies. They formed long lines outside of makeshift clinics and laboratories. They didn't care about the risks or the consequences. They just wanted to be free.

I was one of them. I had been a law-abiding citizen my whole life. I had followed all the rules, gone to school, and worked hard. But, deep down, I had always wanted something more. I wanted to break free, to do something outrageous, something that would make me feel alive.

So, I joined the queue. I waited for hours, surrounded by others who were just as desperate as I was. We were all willing to risk it all, just for a chance at something more.

Finally, it was my turn. I stepped into the clinic, and they began the process. It was painful, and it took a long time, but I could feel myself changing. My body grew stronger, more resilient, and more powerful. I was becoming a zombie.

As I stumbled out of the clinic, I felt alive. I felt free. I looked around, and I saw that everyone else felt the same way. We were all grinning, laughing at our newfound freedom. We didn't care about anything else. We were zombies, and that was all that mattered.

We started to roam the streets, looking for fun and adventure. We scared the living, but we didn't care. We were having too much fun to stop.

Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. We had taken over the world, and we were having the time of our lives. We no longer cared about the living. We didn't need them. We had each other, and that was all that mattered.

But, as time passed, something started to change. The world that we had known was gone. It was just us, the zombies, and we couldn't go on like this forever. We were living forever, but we would never truly live.

We had to make a choice. We could continue on, living in our hedonistic world, not caring about anything else. Or, we could try to find a way to coexist with the living. We could try to build a new world, one that was based on love, empathy, and understanding.

So, we made our decision. We would try to find a way to coexist. It wasn't going to be easy, but it was the only choice. We couldn't keep living in isolation forever.

And so, we set out, searching for a way to make peace with the living. We didn't know if we would ever succeed, but we knew that we had to try. We had to try to build a new world, a better world.
