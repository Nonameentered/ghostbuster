Write a conversation between two best friends- one who grew up exceedingly rich and one who lives in poverty. Don't specify who is who.
Hannah and Camilla have been best friends since elementary school. They have been through everything together- first crushes, school dances, and even their first college acceptance letters. Despite being polar opposites in terms of their upbringings, they have always found common ground and never let their differences get in the way of their friendship. It's a Saturday afternoon, and the two are hanging out at the park, enjoying the beautiful weather and each other's company.

“So, how's your family, Hannah?” Camilla asks, dipping her toes in the cool water of the fountain.

“They're good,” Hannah replies, taking a sip of her water bottle. “My dad's been working a lot lately, but other than that, nothing's really changed.”

“Right. I was thinking about what you told me the other day... about your family going on vacation to some private island for a few weeks?”

“Yeah, it's this really exclusive place that only a handful of people even know about. You can't even find it on Google Maps.”

Camilla can feel a twinge of envy in her heart. While she has never outrightly admitted it to Hannah, she often feels inadequate compared to her friend's exceedingly wealthy lifestyle.

“That sounds amazing,” she says, trying to not sound too disappointed. “I've never even been on a plane before.”

“Really? I had no idea,” Hannah replies, surprised.

“Yeah. I mean, we don't have the money for anything like that.”

“Oh, Cami, don't be silly,” Hannah says, noticing the sudden sadness in her friend's eyes.

“Sorry, I just... sometimes it feels like we're living in two completely different worlds.”

“Sometimes it might seem like that, but you know none of that really matters, right? Money doesn't make you happy. I mean, I'm happy, but it's not because my family can afford to go on these extravagant vacations or send me to private school. It's because of people like you,” Hannah says, smiling.

Camilla's heart flutters a little bit. She knows Hannah means well, but sometimes she wonders if she truly understands what it's like to be struggling to make ends meet.

“Thanks, Hannah. I appreciate it.”

Camilla takes a deep breath and decides to try and steer the conversation in a different direction.

“So, how's your internship going?”

“It's been... okay, I guess. Most of the time, I just feel like I'm not really contributing anything useful. It's all just busy work, you know?”

“Yeah, I can see how that would be frustrating.”

“I just don't understand why they even hired me in the first place if they weren't going to let me do anything important. It's like they're just using me to make themselves look good.”

Camilla knows Hannah has always been proud of her independence and work ethic. She can tell her friend is disappointed with how things are going at her internship.

“Have you talked to your boss about it?”

“I haven't yet, but I think I might have to. I didn't spend all those years studying just to be a glorified assistant.”

“You should definitely talk to them,” Camilla agrees. “You're too smart to be doing menial tasks all day.”

“Thanks, Cami. That really means a lot.”

The two friends sit in contemplative silence for a moment, lost in their own thoughts. Camilla can't help but wonder what it would be like to be in Hannah's shoes.

“What's it like living with so much wealth?”

Hannah looks surprised at the sudden question.

“What do you mean?”

“I mean, like... you must have never had to worry about money, right?”

“Well, I mean, not really. My parents have always made sure we were taken care of. But that doesn't mean we don't have our own problems.”

“I know, I know,” Camilla quickly says, afraid she might have unintentionally offended her friend. “It just seems so different than what I'm used to.”

Hannah takes a deep breath and decides to open up a little more.

“Okay, I'll be honest. Sometimes it's nice not having to worry about where your next meal is coming from or whether or not you can afford to go to the doctor, but there are other times when I feel like my parents are trying to buy my love, you know?”

“I can see how that would be hard.”

Hannah continues, almost as though she's speaking more to herself than to Camilla.

“And it's like... sometimes I feel like I'm never going to be able to do anything meaningful with my life because they've always taken care of everything for me.”

Camilla thinks for a moment before responding.

“I don't think money or a privileged upbringing automatically disqualifies you from doing something meaningful with your life. It's more about what you do with the opportunities you're given.”

Hannah nods, silently taking in Camilla's words. She knows her friend is right, but sometimes it's hard to see things that way when you've never had to struggle for anything.

“Thanks, Cami. You always know just what to say.”

For the rest of the afternoon, the two friends continue to chat and enjoy each other's company, both feeling a newfound sense of closeness and understanding. Despite their drastically different upbringings, they know they will always have each other's backs- through the good times and the bad.
