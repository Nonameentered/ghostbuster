God has come to earth and bestowed omnipotence upon two people, but there's a catch...
God had come to Earth. People had speculated about this moment for millennia, yet they were still shocked when it happened. The good news was that he had blessed two people with omnipotence, the power to create, shape, and control reality itself. The bad news was that there was a catch.

The two people blessed with omnipotence were not allowed to use their power for themselves, only for others. Everyone else, including God, could tell them what to do, and they had to obey. This was the condition that came with the power, and it could not be broken.

The first person, a young woman, was ecstatic when she was given the power. She immediately thought of the good she could do in the world. But as she began to help people, she realized how difficult it was to always put other people's needs before her own. She couldn't go on dates because her dates would always ask her to do things for them. She couldn't even shower or eat without being interrupted by others.

The second person, a man in his forties, was far less enthusiastic about the power. He already felt like he had too many people bossing him around and didn't want to add God and the rest of humanity to the list. However, he couldn't refuse the gift of omnipotence.

Together the two people tried to balance their own needs with the demands of others, but it was a constant struggle. They longed to have just one day when they could make decisions for themselves. But they knew that this was a sacrifice that they had to make for the greater good of humanity.
