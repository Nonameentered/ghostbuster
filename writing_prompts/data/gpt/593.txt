In the near-future you get a female clone of yourself to raise as your daughter, while showing her some old pictures, you realize that she looks exactly like your sister at that age
As soon as I found out I was going to have a clone of myself, I was elated. I couldn't wait to raise her the way I wished I had been raised as a child. Her training started from the moment she was born until she was old enough to understand the world around her. One evening, when I was showing her some old pictures, I realized that she looked exactly like my sister at that age.

I couldn't believe it, but the resemblance was uncanny. My sister, who had passed away several years ago in a car accident, had always been my greatest support system. We were so close that we often finished each other's sentences. She had always been there for me, through thick and thin, and now, it seemed, her spirit was back in the form of my cloned daughter.

I was hit hard by the realization that I couldn't just clone a part of me; my sister had to be in the mix too. I wasn't sure how my daughter would react when she found out, but I didn't want to keep the truth from her. Sharing this information with her would help her understand why the two of them looked so similar.

When I told her, she was shocked at first but soon understood the importance of it. I showed her pictures of my sister and told her about our memories growing up together. I even played some of our favorite songs and sang along with her as if my sister was still right there beside me.

Having my sister's spirit in my daughter was a great comfort to me. Although I had lost her physically, she was still with me in some form. I couldn't help wondering if the universe had brought us together again for a reason.

As the years went by, my daughter grew into an intelligent, compassionate young woman. She had the same sense of humor and mischief as my sister and me, which made me even more grateful for her. I couldn't have asked for a better child - she was everything I had ever dreamed of, and more.

When she turned eighteen, she decided that she wanted to go study bio-engineering at a prestigious university. I was so proud of her and excited to see what she would create in the future,

As she was about to leave, she hugged me tightly and whispered, "I'm so grateful to have you as my mom. You gave me life and so much more." Tears streamed down my face as I replied, "I'm grateful for you too. Your presence in my life is a gift that I will never take for granted."

Looking at my daughter, it was clear to me that my sister would always be with us in some way. She may have left this world too soon, but her spirit lived on through our love for her, and our daughter.
