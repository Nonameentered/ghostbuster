you just invented a time machine, but it can only transport people inside itself. This means this moment is furthest back in time anyone can go. You pull up a chair and wait for the first visitors.
It was a crisp October evening when I finally did it. I invented a time machine. It was something I had always dreamed of, and finally, I had made it a reality. I had spent years on the project, pouring my heart and soul into every detail. The result was a strange, metal contraption that looked like something out of a science fiction movie.

As I looked at my creation, my heart was pounding with excitement and anticipation. I knew that this was going to change the course of human history forever. And yet, at the same time, I knew that there was a catch. My time machine could only transport people inside itself - no one would be able to step out of it, once they had travelled back in time. It was a limitation that I had not been able to overcome, no matter how hard I had tried.

When I first realized this, I was deflated. I had spent so much time and effort on this project, and it had all come down to this one, fatal flaw. But then, I realized something else – this moment, this exact moment, was the furthest back in time that anyone could go. In a sense, my time machine had become the first time machine in the world. It was a moment that I had to witness, one that I had to be a part of. So, I pulled up a chair and waited for the first visitors.

The hours ticked by slowly as I sat there, watching the clock. My eyes flicked back and forth, scanning the room for any sign of life. But there was nothing. The world outside was silent, still, as if everyone was waiting for something.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the first visitor arrived. It was a young woman, dressed in a long white gown. She looked around, taking in her surroundings with a mix of wonder and confusion. And then, she saw me.

"Hello," she said, cautiously approaching me. "What is this place?"

I stood up, eager to explain everything. "This," I said, gesturing to the time machine behind me, "is a time machine. It can transport people back in time, but it can only do so inside itself. This moment, right here, is the furthest back in time that anyone can go. And I’ve been waiting for someone to try it out."

The woman looked at me incredulously. "You mean to tell me that I can travel back in time right now?"

I nodded, a grin spreading across my face. "That’s exactly what I mean. You’ll be the first person in the world to do it. Think about it – you’ll be a part of history!"

The woman stared at me for a moment longer, then made up her mind. "Okay," she said, walking towards the time machine. "Let’s do this."

I felt a surge of excitement as she climbed inside the machine, settling herself into the seat. I closed the door behind her, feeling a sense of reverence wash over me. I knew that I was witnessing something incredible, something historic.

As I turned the dials and flipped the switches, the time machine began to hum to life. It glowed with an otherworldly light, illuminating the room with its brilliance. And then, in a flash of light, it was gone.

For a moment, I stood there, feeling as though I had been transported to another world. But then, I snapped out of it, remembering that the woman would be arriving in a past that had never known the invention of time travel. How would she adapt? What would she do?

Days went by, and I heard nothing. At first, I assumed that my invention had failed. But then, on the fourth day after the woman’s departure, I heard a knock at my door. My heart pounding, I opened it to find the woman standing there.

She was different. Her eyes had a wild look in them, and her hair was wild and unkempt. And yet, there was a sense of wonder and amazement about her that I couldn’t help but envy.

"What happened?" I asked her eagerly. "What did you see?"

The woman sat down in the chair I had offered her. "I went back to the time of the Ancient Greeks," she said, her eyes shining with excitement. "I saw their culture, their art, their way of life. I was amazed by their intelligence and creativity."

I felt a surge of pride at her words. To think that my invention had brought her to such a fascinating place, to see things that no one in the present could ever experience – it was incredible.

But then, the woman’s expression changed. "But there was something else," she said, her voice growing somber. "I realized that everything I had ever known was gone. My family, my friends, my job – they all belonged to a world that no longer existed. I was alone, adrift in a sea of unfamiliarity."

I felt a pang of guilt. Had I made a mistake, in creating something that could so profoundly alter the course of someone’s life?

The woman must have seen the look on my face, because she placed a reassuring hand on my shoulder. "Don’t worry," she said. "I made it back here, didn’t I? And besides, I wouldn’t trade that experience for anything. It was worth everything, every moment of discomfort and disorientation. I feel like I’ve seen the world in a new light."

And that, I realized, was the true power of my invention. It had the power to change the course of a person’s life, to open up new worlds of possibility and understanding. It was a discovery that I could be proud of, one that would shape the course of human history forever. And yet, as I looked at the woman before me, I also recognized that it was a discovery that came with great responsibility. I would have to think carefully, before I let anyone else take that trip – before I let anyone else take that leap into the unknown.
