For as long as she could remember, every morning, she would wake up in a different time period, with a different persona, and an entirely different life. She had been a warrior princess in the medieval era, a renowned scientist in the 21st century, and a farmer's wife in the 1800s. It was never the same, but for the last three days, she had woken up as herself in her small bedroom.

She was confused but relieved. It had become exhausting to constantly adapt to new situations and live up to expectations. She enjoyed the stability of waking up in her own skin, with her own memories.

The fourth day dawned, and she opened her eyes to find herself staring up at a glittering night sky. She sat up and looked around. She was in a spaceship, surrounded by strange aliens. She tried to speak, but her voice didn't seem to work. The realization dawned on her - she hadn't ceased transforming. This was just the first normal day in what could be a never-ending chain of eccentricity.
