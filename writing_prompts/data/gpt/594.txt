As of today, the CIA now interrogates subjects using Adam Sandler movies.
As of today, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) introduced a new method for interrogating suspects. They have started using Adam Sandler movies as a way to extract information from people. The idea was to play his films on repeat until the individual eventually cracked and revealed what they were hiding. Many found it to be an unusual approach to interrogation, but the CIA was confident about its success.

One of the CIA agents, Agent Johnson, was tasked with using this new method. He was a seasoned interrogator with years of experience, but this was a technique that he had never encountered before. As soon as the suspect was brought in, Johnson began playing the first Adam Sandler movie on the list, “Happy Gilmore.” He turned up the volume, making sure it was loud enough to be heard but not too much so that it would be agonizing.

The suspect, a notorious terrorist, glared at Johnson, who returned the stare with indifference. Throughout several screenings, the suspect sat silently, usually with the same stone expression. Johnson began doubting the efficacy of this method and was getting frustrated. Meanwhile, the suspect remained calm and unfazed. 

After several days of continuous screenings of Adam Sandler movies, Johnson was almost at his wit's end. It seemed as if the suspect was immune to the movies. Johnson even tried varying the movie titles, hoping to create a new screen experience. The suspect appeared indifferent to all of them. 

However, Johnson had one last trick up his sleeve: he decided to change the methodology of the screenings. He had a hunch that Sandler’s movies only worked well if they were played continuously for prolonged sessions. Switching between titles might have reduced their effectiveness. He got approval to test his theory.

The following day, Agent Johnson returned to the interrogation room. He started playing "Happy Gilmore" again but being careful to make sure the movie's sound level was lower than before. He then planned on moving on to the next movie after "Happy Gilmore" was over. As he played the movie, he glanced at the suspect, and was surprised by what he saw. The suspect appeared to betray a slight flicker of confusion. Johnson paused the movie, turned to the suspect, and asked, "Is there something you want to tell me?"

The suspect hesitated for a moment before speaking: "I've seen this movie before, and it seems different. Is this a new version of the film?"

Agent Johnson raised an eyebrow, impressed by what he had just witnessed. He responded casually, "I imagine movies can appear different depending on the setting."

The suspect nodded in agreement and said nothing more. Johnson resumed the movie, and for a moment, he noticed the suspect's guard had dropped momentarily. It might have been a small victory, but it was a start. Johnson continued displaying the Adam Sandler movies; sometimes, he would return again to “Happy Gilmore.” The suspect's demeanor remained unchanged over successive days, but Johnson kept up the screenings.

On the sixth day, the suspect finally broke down and began to speak. It turned out that the terrorist’s organization had concocted a plot to create chaos in a public park in the city. They had left several bombs in strategic locations and were planning on timing them to go off simultaneously. The suspect had been tasked to extract a code required to activate the bomb's timing mechanism. 

When Johnson heard this, he immediately thanked the suspect for his cooperation and exited the room to report the information to his superiors. As he walked out of the room, the suspect stared at him thoughtfully, seeming to contain mixed emotions.

The next day Johnson was called to the interrogation room again. The suspect was still there, but this time he wore a smile on his face, unlike the previous times. 

"Can I have a word with you?" the suspect asked.

Johnson nodded in agreement, making his way over to where the suspect stood behind the barriers. 

The suspect apologized for his malicious intentions and assured Johnson that he didn't have a personal vendetta against America. He had merely been asked to carry out the mission as part of his duty to the extremist groups he belonged to. The suspect further told Johnson that he had been inspired by Adam Sandler's films since his childhood and was a massive fan of his work. He had initially remained stubborn and showed no emotion throughout the screenings because he had conditioned himself to ignore all external stimuli so that he would not deviate from his mission objectives.

Johnson found it hard to process the information at first, but he listened attentively. The suspect was articulate, and it was evident that he needed the release. 

In a remarkable twist of fate, Johnson found an unlikely ally in the form of the suspect that he had been interrogating. The duo began to have conversations, their interaction moving beyond the interrogation scenario. Over the course of several days, the discussions turned to other topics, and both individuals found themselves bonding over their shared love for Adam Sandler movies, and the seeming paradox of how one could feel inspired by something that others reviled.

Days turned to weeks, and slowly the initial tension began to dissipate. Johnson received commendation for his performance and for the breakthrough in intelligence. Still, it was the human connection that lingered in Johnson's mind long after the interrogations were over. He learned how one could never underestimate the effect of a common interest in bridging divides. It had taken time, patience and a love for the works of Adam Sandler to start breaking down the walls between the suspect and the interrogator.

It was later claimed that the CIA's Adam Sandler method of interrogation had achieved over 90% success rating. The method may have been unusual, but its results spoke for themselves.

As Johnson walked away from the interrogation room, he couldn't help but think to himself that there were some things that transcended the grit of war and politics. The unlikely bond that had formed between him and the suspect would be the surest indicator that the world was not as black and white as it often seemed.
