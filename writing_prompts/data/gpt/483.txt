It was a crisp autumn evening in rural New England, and twelve-year-old Timmy sat on the porch with his grandfather, gazing up at the stars. They had spent many nights like this, talking about everything from the constellations to their favorite baseball teams.

Suddenly, Grandpa jumped up from his rocking chair and pointed to the sky. "Look, Timmy! Do you see it?" he exclaimed.

Timmy squinted his eyes and looked up, trying to see what his grandfather was pointing at. And then he saw it - a bright, glowing object streaking across the sky.

"It's Sputnik!" Grandpa exclaimed, a look of wonder on his face.

Timmy had heard of Sputnik on the news, but he never thought he would actually see it. He watched in awe as the satellite flew overhead, amazed at how something man-made could soar so high and so fast. 

"Do you remember when we used to listen to the radio, Grandpa?" Timmy asked, breaking the silence.

Grandpa chuckled. "Of course I do. And I remember when we first got a television, too. Your grandma never thought we needed one. But we watched Neil Armstrong walk on the moon on that thing."

Timmy leaned his head against his grandfather's shoulder, feeling a sense of comfort and safety next to him. They sat in silence for a while longer, watching the stars twinkle in the sky.

"Grandpa, do you think I could ever be an astronaut?" Timmy asked, breaking the silence.

Grandpa smiled. "Anything is possible, Timmy. You just have to work hard and believe in yourself."

Timmy felt a sense of excitement wash over him, imagining himself flying through space and exploring new worlds. His grandfather had always encouraged him to dream big, even if they seemed impossible to others.

As the Sputnik passed out of sight, Timmy stood up and stretched his arms. "I think I'm going to bed, Grandpa. Thanks for everything tonight," he said.

Grandpa stood up and gave Timmy a pat on the back. "Sleep well, Timmy. And always remember to reach for the stars."

Timmy went to bed that night feeling excited, inspired, and a little scared. The thought of reaching for the stars was both thrilling and intimidating. But he couldn't wait to see what his future held.

Over the next few weeks, Timmy spent every spare moment at the library, reading everything he could about space and the stars. He even wrote a letter to NASA, telling them he wanted to be an astronaut one day.

Months went by, and Timmy continued to dream big with the support of his grandfather. And then, one day, a letter arrived for him in the mail. It was from NASA, and it said they had received his letter and were impressed with his passion for space.

Timmy felt like he was floating on cloud nine. He couldn't believe that NASA had actually responded to his letter. It was like a dream come true.

Years went by, and Timmy grew up to become an astronaut, just like he had always dreamed. And he could still remember that night when he and his grandfather had watched Sputnik pass overhead. It was the moment that had ignited his passion for space, and the memory had stayed with him his whole life. 

And on every mission he flew, Timmy sent a silent thank you to his grandfather, who had encouraged him to reach for the stars.
