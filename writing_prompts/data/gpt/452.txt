You are a high school student that's secretly the author of a best-seller sci-fi/fantasy novel based on your real-life adventures involving aliens, magic, time traveling, etc. Your English teacher is having the class read your book and he's getting everything wrong.
I always knew that my life was not ordinary, but I never thought that my imagination would lead me to become a best-selling author. I had finally found my true calling in writing science fiction and fantasy novels. However, I never disclosed my identity to anyone as I didn't want to be labeled as a child prodigy.

Things changed when my English teacher assigned my novel as mandatory reading for the class. My heart was pounding as I sat in my English class listening to my teacher discussing my book. I was excited but terrified at the same time.

I was so glad to see that the students were enjoying my book, but my elation soon turned to frustration when I realized that my teacher was not reading it correctly. He was getting almost everything wrong. The way he interpreted my characters, the plot and even the ending, was a complete mismatch to what I had intended for my readers.

I remembered my excitement about sharing my book with others, but now it felt like a mistake. I couldn't bear to be a fly on the wall in my own classroom, so I excused myself from the class and went to the library.

As I walked towards a table, a girl who had been sitting there called out my name and said, "You're the author of that amazing book we are reading in class, aren't you?" I shyly nodded my head and slowly opened up my heart to her. She too loved my book and was saddened by what our English teacher was doing to it. My love for the art of writing only grew stronger after that day, and I promised myself that I would continue to share my stories no matter who was reading them.
