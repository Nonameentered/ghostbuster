"Let's try something different," said Amelia, her eyes shining with excitement.

"What do you mean?" asked her friend Sarah, a little cautiously.

"I mean instead of our usual routine of going to the bar, let's do something we've never done before. Something wild and crazy," Amelia replied, her voice growing more animated by the second.

Sarah considered Amelia's suggestion for a moment. She was always up for new experiences, but she couldn't help feeling a little apprehensive about what her friend had in mind.

But Amelia was already a step ahead, grabbing Sarah's hand and tugging her towards the door.

"Come on, let's go!"

The two friends stepped out into the chilly night air, eager to discover what new adventure awaited them.

Amelia led them down a winding road, Sarah following her friend's lead hesitantly. As they turned a corner, they saw a brightly lit storefront with a sign that read 'Fortune Tellers.'

Amelia's eyes widened as she read the sign. "This is perfect!" she exclaimed. "Let's get our fortunes told!"

Sarah wasn't so sure. She had always been skeptical of such things, but Amelia's enthusiasm was contagious.

"Okay, fine. Let's do it," she said with a smile.

As they stepped inside the storefront, an old woman with a shawl and a crystal ball greeted them. The room was dimly lit, with candles illuminating the corners, and a musky scent hung in the air.

The woman gestured for the girls to sit at the small table in front of her.

"What is it that you wish to know, my dears?" she asked, her voice soft and raspy.

Amelia was the first to speak. "I want to know about my future," she said, leaning forward eagerly.

The old woman smiled knowingly. "Very well, then. Give me your hand."

Amelia extended her hand, and the woman took it gently in her own. She closed her eyes and began to murmur to herself, while Amelia's eyes grew wide with excitement.

Suddenly, the woman's eyes snapped open, and she looked straight at Amelia.

"You will meet the love of your life within the month," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Amelia's eyes widened even further, and she clapped her hands excitedly. "Oh my god! I can't wait to see who it is!"

Sarah just smiled, amused at her friend's reaction. But she couldn't help feeling a little left out. She wanted to hear something about her future too.

The woman turned towards Sarah, and gestured for her to come closer.

"And what about you, my dear?" she asked.

Sarah hesitated before extending her hand. The woman's fingers were cold as she took Sarah's hand in her own. She looked into her eyes, as if searching for something.

"You will face a great challenge in the near future," she said finally. "But with perseverance, you will come out on top."

Sarah felt a shiver run down her spine, but she couldn't tell if it was from the cold or from the woman's words.

As they stepped out of the storefront, Amelia couldn't stop chattering excitedly about what the fortune teller had said. But Sarah was lost in thought, her mind consumed by the woman's words.

They wandered through the city streets, lost in their own thoughts, until they stumbled upon a bar that they had never seen before. It was made of wood and had a cozy, warm glow radiating from within.

"We should go in here!" said Amelia, already tugging on Sarah's sleeve.

The two friends stepped inside, and were greeted by the sounds of live music coming from a stage at the corner of the room.

As they made their way through the crowd, they spotted a group of guys sitting at a table, laughing and chatting.

Amelia nudged Sarah. "We should go talk to them!" she said.

Sarah wasn't so sure. She had never been very good at flirting with guys, but Amelia was already making her way towards the table.

As they approached, one of the guys looked up and caught Amelia's eye. He had dark hair and piercing blue eyes that seemed to stare straight through her.

"Hi there," he said, a slight smile playing at the corners of his mouth.

Amelia smiled back nervously. "Hi," she replied.

They struck up a conversation, and Sarah found herself getting drawn into the conversation as well. They talked about their jobs, their interests, and their favorite travel destinations.

But Sarah couldn't shake off the feeling of unease that had settled over her ever since the fortune teller's words. She couldn't help wondering what kind of challenge she was going to face.

As the night wore on, the two groups found themselves on the dance floor, swaying to the music. Sarah found herself dancing with one of the guys, his arms wrapped around her waist.

But as the song ended, the guy suddenly pulled away from her, his eyes widening in horror.

"What's wrong?" Sarah asked, looking up at him with confusion.

But he didn't reply. Instead, he just pointed over her shoulder, his mouth hanging open.

Sarah turned around, and saw a man standing just a few feet away from her. He was tall and muscular, with wild hair and piercing eyes that seemed to be staring straight through her.

"Sarah," he said, his voice cold and menacing.

Sarah's heart leapt into her throat. How did this man know her name? Who was he?

Before she could say anything, the man grabbed her by the arm and dragged her out of the bar. The last thing she saw was Amelia's face, frozen in shock and fear.

And then everything went dark.

***

Sarah woke up in a dark, damp room. She tried to move, but found that her arms and legs were bound tight with rope.

She looked around, her eyes gradually adjusting to the dim light. She saw the man from the bar standing across the room, a menacing grin on his face.

"What do you want?" Sarah asked, her voice trembling.

The man didn't reply. Instead, he just walked towards her, a syringe in his hand.

Sarah's heart was racing as she saw the needle approaching her skin. She tried to scream, but her voice caught in her throat.

And then everything went black again.

***

As Amelia walked home from the bar, her mind was whirling. What had just happened? Where was Sarah?

She tried calling her friend's phone, but it went straight to voicemail. She knocked on the doors of all the houses on the street, asking if anyone had seen a girl in distress.

But no one had.

Desperate, she went back to the fortune teller's storefront and begged her for answers. But the old woman just looked at her with sad eyes.

"I'm sorry, my dear. Your friend is in great danger. But there is nothing you can do to help her."

Amelia felt her heart sink as she realized the truth of the woman's words. Sarah was gone, and there was nothing she could do to help her.

The end
