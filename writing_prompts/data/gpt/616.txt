I leaned forward, a glint in my eye. "I have experience in weapons training, surveillance, and infiltration. I can blend into any environment and gather information with ease."

The mastermind sat back, stroking his chin thoughtfully. "Very impressive. And tell me, have you ever killed anyone before?"

My heart raced at the question, but I knew I couldn't show any signs of weakness. "Yes, I have."
