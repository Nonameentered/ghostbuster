You are at home one day when you look into the mirror, and notice that your sister, who passed away years ago, is smiling at you from inside. You walk over and reach out to touch her, and your hand goes through the glass...
It was just like any other day. I returned home from my office and went straight to my room to change. As I looked into the mirror, I noticed something strange. Instead of my reflection, I saw my sister, who passed away years ago, smiling at me from inside.

I was taken aback by the sight. My sister was the closest person I had in my life, and her sudden death had left a void in my life. Tears welled up in my eyes as I walked towards the mirror to touch her. But as I reached out to place my hand on the mirror, my hand went through the glass. It was as if she was right there, standing in front of me.

As I tried to gather my thoughts and make sense of what was happening, my sister beckoned me to follow her and walked away. I hesitated for a moment, unsure of what to do, but a strong feeling of curiosity overtook me, and I decided to follow her.

She led me through the house, and I followed her to the garden. The sky had turned cloudy, and a gentle breeze was blowing. We stood there for a while, looking up at the sky. Suddenly, she turned to me and gave me a faint smile before disappearing into the thin air.

For a while, I stood there, confused and bewildered. Was it all a dream? Did I imagine all of it? I wanted answers, but I knew none seemed forthcoming. So, I went inside, thinking about the strange occurrence.

As I turned on the TV, I couldn't help but feel a strange sensation. The news on the TV was about a massive thunderstorm that had just hit the city, and as I watched it, I heard a sudden rumble outside. Moments later, our power went out, and everything went dark.

That's when I realized that whatever I'd just experienced was more than a dream. It was a sign from my sister warning me of an impending disaster, and I had to act on it. So, I gathered my belongings, and I left the house just as a massive thunderstorm hit.

I knew that my sister had saved my life from whatever was about to happen. As I watched the ferocious storm, I couldn't help but feel grateful, knowing that the only way my sister could communicate was through the mirror.
