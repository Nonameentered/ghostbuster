For your company's last annual disaster training, you jokingly wrote a Zombie Apocalypse Plan. Now the news is carrying disturbing reports of Zombies and your co-workers are looking to your plan for salvation...
It started as a joke, a fun way to spice up our annual disaster training. I suggested a Zombie Apocalypse Plan, thinking it would get some laughs from my coworkers. But now, as reports of real-life zombie attacks flood the news, my joking idea suddenly doesn’t seem so funny.

I can see the fear in my coworkers’ eyes as they look to me for guidance. They remember my plan, and they want to know if it could help save us from this terrifying new threat. As the person who proposed the idea, I feel a sense of responsibility to protect them.

I quickly pull out my plan and begin to read through it. I had outlined a few crucial steps – secure the building, stockpile food and water, and arm ourselves with makeshift weapons. It all seemed ridiculous at the time, but now it’s our only hope.

We quickly get to work, barricading doors and windows, rationing food, and fashioning weapons out of whatever we can find. It’s like a scene out of a horror movie, but this is real life, and our survival depends on our ability to follow my formerly-joking plan.

We work together, fighting off the undead hoards and doing everything we can to stay alive. At the end of the day, when the last zombie has been defeated, we all look to each other with a newfound sense of respect and appreciation. And me? Well, let’s just say I’ll never underestimate the power of a good disaster plan again.
