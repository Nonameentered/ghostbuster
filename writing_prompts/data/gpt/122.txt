The dead living were not zombies. They were not reanimated bodies stumbling through the streets, hungry for brains. They were ghosts. Spirits of the departed who had not moved on, but instead chose to linger.

Sarah knew about the dead living because she was one of them. She had died three years ago in a car accident. She was eighteen and had just graduated high school. She had been driving home from a party when a drunk driver hit her car. She had died instantly.

But instead of moving on to whatever came next, Sarah stayed behind. She couldn't bear the thought of leaving her family behind. She couldn't bear the thought of never seeing them again. So she chose to stay.

At first, it was easy. She could move through walls, watch her family go about their daily lives, and even communicate with them. They weren't aware of her presence, but Sarah didn't mind. She was content just being near them.

But as time went on, things started to change. Sarah watched as her family moved on with their lives. Her little sister graduated from college, her parents sold the family home and moved to Florida, and her best friend got married.

Sarah realized that she was stuck. She couldn't move on, but she couldn't stay with her family forever. She was a ghost, a dead living, and she didn't know what to do.

One day, Sarah met another dead living. His name was Jack, and he had died in a car accident just like she had. Jack had been married and had a daughter. He too had chosen to stay behind, unable to leave his family.

Jack and Sarah quickly became friends. They shared their stories and their struggles. They talked about what it felt like to be a dead living and how they wished they could move on.

One day, Jack had an idea. "What if we help each other move on?" he said. "Maybe if we help someone in need, we can finally find peace and move on."

Sarah was hesitant at first. She didn't know how they could help someone else when they couldn't even help themselves. But Jack convinced her to try.

They spent weeks searching for someone in need. They watched from the shadows, looking for someone who needed their help. And finally, they found her.

Her name was Emily, and she was a young girl who had lost her parents in a car accident. She was all alone and didn't know where to turn. Sarah and Jack watched as Emily struggled to make ends meet and to come to terms with her loss.

They knew that they had to help her. They started small, moving objects around to get her attention. They didn't want to frighten her, but they wanted her to know that they were there.

Eventually, Emily started to notice. She would leave out food for them, and sometimes she would talk to them. She didn't know who they were or what they were, but she knew that they were trying to help her.

Sarah and Jack continued to help Emily. They would move things for her, leave her notes of encouragement, and even scare away a burglar who tried to break into her home.

As time went on, Sarah and Jack started to feel different. They felt lighter, as if a weight had been lifted off their shoulders. They knew that they were finally starting to move on.

One day, Sarah and Jack watched as Emily stood in front of a mirror, brushing her hair. She looked over her shoulder and saw them standing behind her. For the first time, she could see them.

Sarah and Jack smiled at her, and she smiled back. They knew that this was their moment. They walked toward Emily, and as they did, they started to fade away.

Emily watched as they disappeared before her eyes. She didn't know what had happened, but she knew that something important had occurred. She felt a weight lifted off her shoulders, as if she had finally found closure.

As for Sarah and Jack, they had finally moved on. They were no longer dead living, but spirits who had completed their final task. They had helped someone in need, and in doing so, they had found their peace.
