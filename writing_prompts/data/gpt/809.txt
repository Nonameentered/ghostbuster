The last man alive is desperately trying to prevent the extinction of mankind via timetravel, but he's having a hard time pinpointing when exactly everything started going wrong.
John had always known that he would be the last man alive. It was a foregone conclusion, written into his destiny since the day he was born. He had always expected it to be a peaceful end, the inevitable result of a long and fulfilling life. But that wasn't how it happened. The world ended with a bang, not a whimper, and John was the only one left to pick up the pieces.

In the aftermath, John had spent decades scouring the ruins of civilization for any scrap of information that might help him prevent the extinction of mankind. He had built a laboratory deep in the heart of a mountain, where he spent countless hours poring over ancient texts and scientific journals. He had developed a time machine, the likes of which the world had never seen before, and he was obsessed with using it to go back in time and stop the disaster from ever happening.

But there was one problem. John didn't know when, exactly, everything started going wrong.

He had a vague sense that the disaster was related to climate change, but he couldn't say for sure. There were so many factors at play, so many different components to the complex web of human civilization, that isolating a single point of failure seemed impossible. John had spent countless hours crunching numbers and running simulations, but he always ended up back where he started, in a state of frustrating uncertainty.

As the years went by, John began to feel more and more isolated. He spent decades in his lab, working alone, with no human contact except for the occasional supply drop from the surface. He grew old and tired, but he refused to give up. He had a mission, a purpose, and he would not rest until he found the answer he was looking for.

Finally, one day, after decades of searching, John had a breakthrough. He was carefully combing through an ancient database of weather patterns when he noticed a strange anomaly. The data showed a sudden and dramatic shift in climate patterns, one that seemed to come out of nowhere. John felt a jolt of excitement. This was it. This was the key he had been looking for.

But still, he couldn't pinpoint exactly when the disaster happened. The data was too vague, too imprecise. It could have been five years ago, or fifty. John felt a rising sense of panic. He was running out of time. He had to act fast.

John poured himself into his work like never before. He spent every waking hour tweaking and refining his time machine, searching for a way to go back in time and stop the disaster from ever happening. He tested and retested his calculations, refining them until they were as precise as possible.

Finally, he was ready. John stepped into the time machine and set the coordinates for the year that he believed was the most likely candidate for the disaster. He pushed the button and felt a sudden lurch as the machine came to life. Everything went black.

When John awoke, he was standing in the middle of a bustling city street. People milled about him, going about their daily business. John felt a jolt of shock. This wasn't right. This wasn't how it was supposed to be.

He looked around, trying to get his bearings. Everything seemed normal, perhaps even better than normal. The air was clean, the buildings were intact, and people seemed genuinely happy. John felt a sense of incredulity. Had he miscalculated? Had he somehow managed to set the coordinates wrong?

He pulled out his communicator and tried to reach his lab, but there was no response. John's heart sank. He realized with a sinking feeling that somehow, somewhere along the way, he had made a mistake. He had traveled back too far, or not far enough, or to the wrong place entirely.

John spent the next several weeks wandering through the city, trying to make sense of what had happened. He found that he had traveled back several decades, before the disaster had even happened. He watched in amazement as humanity flourished around him, completely oblivious to the catastrophe that would one day befall them.

John felt a sense of despair. He had spent so long in his lab, so focused on his mission, that he had lost sight of what he was actually fighting for. He had become so obsessed with preventing the disaster that he had forgotten the importance of the people he was trying to save.

In the end, John decided to stay in the past. He put his time machine in storage and set about trying to make a difference in the world in his own small way. He volunteered at local schools, teaching children about science and technology. He worked with city officials to promote conservation and sustainable living. He even fell in love with a woman and started a family.

John knew that he would never be able to prevent the disaster from happening. He had accepted that his quest had been, in some ways, futile. But he also knew that he could make a difference, even if it was just on a small scale. He had learned that the best way to prevent an extinction wasn't to travel back in time and change the world, but to change the people in it. To inspire them to believe in a better future, and to work towards it every day.

In the end, John realized that he didn't need to be the last man alive to save mankind. He just needed to be a small part of the world, doing his part to make it a little bit better.
