As a freelance writer, I had been sent to cover the latest political rally in town. When I arrived at the venue, I noticed a peculiar character who seemed to stand out from the rest of the media personnel. He was a video journalist who had a knack for capturing footage that was always ahead of the event- footage that couldn't be explained. It was almost as if he could predict the future.

Feeling intrigued, I decided to strike up a conversation with him. "Excuse me, do you mind if I ask what you're doing differently to stay ahead of the game?" I asked.

He turned towards me with a slight smirk, "Well, it's a little something I like to call foresight. You see, I can sense the direction something or someone is headed. The future, you might say."

I was taken aback, not knowing how to respond to his unusual answer. "I'm sorry, did you say you can see the future?" I asked again, hoping to get a more reasonable response.

"Indeed, my friend. And it's not just limited to visuals. I can hear and taste the future too, if need be," he replied, taking me by surprise.

I was still processing his answer when the rally began. As the politician rallied the crowd with his heated rhetoric, I noticed a sudden shift in the atmosphere. The people started hurling insults, and before long, they broke out into a full-blown riot.

Before I could even react, the video journalist had already darted towards the fracas, camera in hand. He maneuvered through the crowd effortlessly, and within minutes, he had captured some of the most compelling footage I had ever seen. His foresight had allowed him to stay at the right place and at the right time, capturing the events before they unfolded. The video was suitable for primetime news, which I knew I had to report on right away.

As soon as I got back to the newsroom, I immediately pulled the editor to the side, urging him to watch the video file. "This footage is incredible. I've never seen anything like it. The video journalist who shot it uses his ability to see the future to capture the most extraordinary stories," I explained.

The editor was skeptical at first, thinking that I had fallen asleep on the job, but upon seeing the footage, he was blown away. "We have to run this. This makes us overnight," he said with a grin.

I got the task of interviewing the video journalist, whose name, I later discovered, was Ben. As I sat in a café, waiting for him to show up for the interview, I excitedly imagined what tales he had captured with his ability.

Ben walked in a few minutes later, attired in a classic trench coat that looked a bit out of fashion. He spotted me and walked over to sit down. "Good afternoon. I'm Ben. Nice to meet you," he said as he reached out his hand.

I shook his hand, still a bit dazed by his abilities. "Wow," I said. "I am still trying to wrap my head around what you showed me yesterday. Have you always been able to see things before they happen?"

"I've always had the ability to sense things differently. It's more like having an intuition that is stronger than most. I just learned to control it through the years," he explained.

"And you use it to get the best stories?" I asked.

"I use it to serve the truth. Not everyone gets the chance to share their story, and I want to make sure that those whose voices would otherwise be silenced get the attention they deserve," he said.

As the interview progressed, we delved deeper into how his abilities worked and how he used them responsibly in his journalism work. I couldn't help but admire his passion for storytelling and his commitment to showing the world how it actually was.

As I was about to leave the café, Ben handed me a business card and said, "If you ever need anything, feel free to let me know. Who knows, maybe I'll have something for you in the future."

Over the next few weeks, I worked with Ben closely as we covered several events and built a friendship. He showed me how he could manipulate his senses to see further into the future and predict outcomes. Once at a crime scene, Ben had correctly predicted the locations of where the culprits might be hiding. This saved the police force valuable time and even helped in rescuing a hostage.

But as we continued to work together, the burden of knowledge of what he could do weighed heavily on me. I couldn't help but wonder if his ability to see the future could be misused if it fell into the wrong hands.

One evening, as we sat down to have a drink, I raised my concerns. "Don't you think your abilities could be dangerous if they were to fall into the wrong hands?" I asked him.

He pondered for a moment, "Anything can be dangerous if the person using it is not responsible. What matters is how I use it."

For the first time in our conversations, I was taken aback by his response. His answer showed that while he had the gift of foresight, he was still human. He had normal fears and doubts the same as everybody else.

I couldn't help the feeling that had crept inside my chest- a mix of admiration and fear for Ben and his abilities. However, with time, the admiration grew stronger, and I knew his abilities were being used for the good of the people.

Over time, the news of Ben's skills spread throughout the journalism community, and he became something of a legend. Rumors circulated that heads of state would often reach out to him for consultations and advice on what the future held.

As I sat down to pen this article, the conversation we had that day flashed through my mind. It was astounding how a video journalist who could see into the future had created such an impact.

And as I put down the pen, I knew that stories of the great video journalist, Ben, who could see the future, and his otherworldly abilities would continue to be told for generations to come.
