The group of old friends gathered at their favorite bar, reminiscing about the past and catching up on each other's lives. They laughed and joked like they used to, and it felt like old times.

"Just like old times, huh?" said Sarah, taking a sip of her beer.

"Yeah, but a lot has changed since then," replied Jake, looking at his friends. "We all have families and careers now."

"But it's nice to be able to come together again," said John, raising his glass in a toast.

As they talked, memories flooded back. They remembered the times they spent together in college, pulling all-nighters, and partying until the sun came up. They remembered how they got each other through the tough times, and the long road trips they took together.

Suddenly, Sam, one of their old friends, walked in. He had been away for years and none of them had seen him since he left.

"Sam! Just like old times, huh?" said Emily, giving him a hug.

"Old times, definitely," said Sam, smiling at his old friends.

As they caught up on each other's lives, they reminisced about the old days. They talked about the times they spent together, the memories they shared, and how much they missed each other.

As the night went on, they joked and laughed like they used to, and it felt like nothing had changed. They promised to keep in touch and see each other more often, knowing that life is too short not to enjoy it with your friends.

"Just like old times," they said, clinking their glasses together, as they continued to enjoy each other's company, knowing that no matter where life takes them, they will always have these memories to cherish.
