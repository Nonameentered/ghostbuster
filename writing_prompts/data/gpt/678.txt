Killing Hitler has become a sport amongst time travelers. Points are awarded for creativity and difficulty. You are last year's champion, how did you win?
It was early morning in my small apartment when I received a notification on my time travel device. It read: "Killing Hitler challenge begins in 12 hours." I was the reigning champion from the previous year's challenge, and the announcement brought a thrill through my entire body.

I jumped out of bed, my heart beating with excitement. As I quickly got dressed, my mind raced with ideas of how I could outdo my previous year's kill. The Killing Hitler challenge had become the ultimate sport amongst time travelers, and I was determined to once again take the crown.

In the competition, points were awarded based on creativity and difficulty. Killing Hitler was not an easy task; he had been the world's most notorious dictator, responsible for the deaths of millions of people. Therefore, assassinating him had been considered a noble pursuit. But as the years progressed, it had become more of a game than a noble cause. Time travelers now competed to see who could come up with the most interesting and difficult methods to kill Hitler.

I had won the previous year's challenge by using a poison that had never before been created in human history. It had taken me months to research and gather the components to make it, but it had been worth it. The poison had not only been lethal but had left no trace as to how Hitler had died, which made the kill all the more impressive.

This year, however, I knew I needed to up my game. My competitors wouldn't be satisfied with a simple poison kill. I needed something truly unforgettable.

As I left my apartment, I scrolled through my device's database of history books, newspapers, and articles on Hitler's life. I needed to find an event or situation that no one else had exploited. My mind raced as I read. It was then that I stumbled upon the perfect plot.

Hitler was known for his obsession with Wagner's music. He had even named his dog after one of the composer's characters. I knew then that a Wagner concert would be the perfect opportunity to eliminate Hitler. The concert was being held in a small theater in Bayreuth, Germany, and the competition organizers had arranged for exclusive access to it for the competitors.

I arrived at the theater and made my way to the stage, where the conductor was rehearsing for the night's performance. I introduced myself and explained my idea. Initially, he was hesitant, but I managed to persuade him that it was for the greater good.

On the night of the concert, I watched from the wings as Hitler entered the theater, his entourage following closely behind. The audience erupted in applause, and the conductor signaled for the music to begin.

As the orchestra played, I focused on the cue that I had given the conductor. It was a dissonant note that would be almost imperceptible to the audience. Suddenly, the orchestra stopped, and the conductor turned to Hitler. He pointed at him and shouted, "You should die!"

As the audience gasped in horror, I stepped out of the wings and onto the stage. I pulled out a gun and aimed it at Hitler. In the confusion, his bodyguards were slow to react, and I was able to fire off several shots. All of them hit their target, and Hitler slumped down onto the floor.

As I made my escape, I realized that my kill had been creative, efficient, and impressive. The orchestra had played their part, and my cue had been timed perfectly. It had been a difficult task, but I had succeeded spectacularly.

The organizers of the challenge awarded me the highest points for creativity and difficulty. My kill had been the most impressive one in the competition's history, and my name was once again etched into the annals of time travel history as the reigning champion.

In the aftermath of the challenge, I couldn't help but wonder if killing Hitler could ever truly be seen as a game. The man had been responsible for unspeakable horrors, and his removal from history had been an undeniable good. But as I sat in my apartment, reflecting on my victory, I also knew that my role as a time traveler had become to rewrite history and remove the evil that existed within it.

I resolved not to let the Killing Hitler challenge become an ego boost or a frivolous competition. Instead, I would use my talents to stop villains before they could rise to power, to prevent wars before they could erupt, and to create a better future for all humanity.

In the end, killing Hitler wasn't just a sport amongst time travelers; it was a responsibility, a calling, and a way to bring about a brighter future for all of humanity.
