You always find solace atop the highest hill in your hometown. The hike up is steep, but worth it for the magnificent view of the city below. You take me by the hand and lead the way. We start at the bottom of the hill, giving us plenty of time to catch up on life.

As we start to climb upwards, I notice how the air becomes fresher, the noise level drops, and the trees become taller. We pass a group of hikers on the way, all taking a break under the shade of a tree. We wave and continue. 

The trail twists and turns, and we take our time, enjoying the scenery of the forest. Finally, we emerge from the treeline and gasp at the sight in front of us. The view is breathtaking, and we take a moment to let it sink in. The city spreads out before us, the buildings looking small from this height.

We sit on the grass, taking in all the beauty around us. The wind whips through our hair, and it feels invigorating. You tell me that during the fall, the whole city looks as if it is on fire, the trees transforming into a rainbow of oranges and yellows.

You start to reminisce about the times you've spent up on this hill, how it was always your escape from the stress of life. You've come up here to read, to write, to contemplate, and sometimes even scream your worries and fears into the wind. 

As the sun slowly sets, you decide to show me your favorite part of the hill â€“ a small clearing among the trees. It's where you pour out your soul to the world, screaming, crying, and laughing until you feel a weight being lifted from your shoulders. 

We make our way over to the clearing, and you start up the steep climb to the top of a large boulder. I follow you, no questions asked. When we reach the top, we sit down and take several deep breaths. The sight from here is magical. The colors of the setting sun illuminate the sky with an otherworldly hue, and the view of the world below us is unparalleled.

You tell me how this spot is your haven, your place of solitude, of screaming, of healing. You tell me about the times you've hidden here from the world, when you needed time to think, without the noise of society forcing itself on you.

We sit in silence, taking one last look at the colors of the sunset, the beauty of the city slowly fading away in the darkness. You tell me that this spot taught you that the world is big and small at the same time. Small because it's easy to find a spot where you can disconnect from everything, big because it's still full of unknown places, unexplored and waiting to be discovered.

As we start to make our way back down the mountain, bags heavy with the weight of memories and experiences, you reassure me that everyone needs a spot like this, a spot of healing, of release and of comfort. 

I ask you if you feel different each time you come up here. You tell me that it's always different. The wind, the light, the colors, the mood, the seasons, everything is different. Each time you come here, it's like an alternate reality that takes you away from your everyday life. Each time it's a reminder that the world is vast, and it's up to us to explore and find the hidden gems that make it beautiful.

We come down, full of life, full of energy, full of memories, and full of emotions that we plan to cherish for a lifetime. It's incredible how taking the time to escape the noise of life can cause you to think differently, to be different. When we reach the parking lot, I know I'll remember this experience forever, the experience of reaching for the sky and finding a piece of solace. 

As we say our goodbyes, you tell me that you know we all have our demons, and that's why it's essential to have a place we can always run to. A place that will understand all our sobbing, all our screaming, all our laughter and all our joys. 

This spot has become our own little haven, and we know that although we're leaving it behind now, we'll be back soon. For as the world goes on and life continues to spiral us all into chaos, this place will be waiting here for us, a reminder to always take a step back and breathe.
