The System has appointed you as the newest Regulator, one of the elite. Except you have no idea exactly what you are supposed to be'regulating', and it slowly becomes apparent that neither do any of your co-workers.
As I stood before the System, receiving my appointment papers, I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment. I was now one of the elite, a Regulator, tasked with ensuring the smooth functioning of society. The System had placed their trust in me, and I was determined to fulfill my duties to the best of my abilities.

However, as I walked into the Regulator's Office, I soon realized that things were not as straightforward as they seemed. My colleagues were busy with their work, yet they all seemed to be doing something different. I decided to introduce myself to the team, hoping to get a clearer understanding of my role.

"Hi everyone, I'm the newest Regulator. Can someone please explain to me what exactly we are supposed to be regulating?"

My colleagues exchanged perplexed looks before shuffling some papers to appear busy. I could tell they were uncomfortable with my question, but I persisted. No matter who I asked or what department I investigated, the answer was the same: vague, elusive, and uninformative.

I couldn't believe it. How could we all be working towards the same goal if we didn't even know what that goal was?

Out of sheer frustration, I turned to the System for answers. But they were equally unhelpful. Every time I asked for clarity on our roles and responsibilities, I was met with a generic, company-approved response.

"This is confidential information that only senior officials are privy to. Rest assured, you are performing valuable work."

My colleagues and I were floundering. Without a clear objective or direction, we were only able to maintain the status quo. But I was not content with that.

As a Regulator, it was my duty to ensure that society functioned smoothly. It was my responsibility to hold those in power accountable and to create structures that benefit everyone, not just the privileged few. This was not possible unless we knew what we were regulating.

I took it upon myself to take action. I spent countless nights reading through dusty tomes and scouring through archives, piecing together clues to form a complete picture of our mandate. It was through sheer determination and grit that I discovered the true purpose of a Regulator.

Our task was to ensure a balance between the needs of the people and the System. It was our role to make sure that no individual or institution became too powerful, and that everyone had an equal voice. To ensure fairness and justice in a world that was rapidly changing.

I shared my findings with my colleagues, and we worked tirelessly to align our efforts with this newfound understanding. Together, we built a framework that could withstand the test of time - one that prioritized the wellbeing of society over personal gain.

As I look back on my journey, I realize that the greatest lesson I learned is that we don't need to have all the answers to make a difference. Sometimes, it's about asking the right questions and fighting for clarity, even in the face of uncertainty.

As a Regulator, I may have started with no idea what I was regulating, but I know now that my purpose is greater than any one task. It is to ensure that our society functions with equity and compassion - a goal that I will work towards, with conviction, for as long as I live.
