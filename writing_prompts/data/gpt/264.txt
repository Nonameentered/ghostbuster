The old man sat alone in his house, surrounded by memories of a life long-lived. He had outlived his friends and family, his only company the creak of his settling bones and the occasional visits from his caretaker. He knew that his time was coming, that he would soon join those who had gone before him.

But what if he was already dead? The thought had been nagging at him for weeks, ever since he had overheard his caretaker talking on the phone.

"He's just an old man with no family or friends left," she had said. "Once he's gone, no one will ever think of him again."

The old man's heart had sunk at those words. Was he really so insignificant that he would be forgotten as soon as he left this world? Would he truly die twice – once when he took his final breath and again when his name was spoken for the last time?

That night, sitting alone in his quiet house, the old man made a decision. He would not go quietly into that good night. He would not accept being forgotten. He would make sure that his name was spoken long after his body had been laid to rest.

And so he began to write. He penned his life story, the highlights and the low moments. He wrote poetry and short stories, pouring his heart and soul into every word. He shared his work with anyone who would listen, determined that his voice would be heard.

When the old man finally passed, his caretaker found his writings scattered across the house. She read through them all, amazed by the depth and emotion in every page.

The old man had accomplished what he set out to do – he had ensured that his name would never be forgotten.
