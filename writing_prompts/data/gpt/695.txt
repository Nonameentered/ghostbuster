Last night the monsters returned, and they were more ferocious than ever before. Lily, a young girl of seven, was awoken by the sound of growling outside her window. She peered out to see a pack of frightening creatures with razor-sharp teeth and glowing eyes.

Lily knew what she had to do. She had to be brave. So, she grabbed her flashlight and crept out of her bedroom, sneaking through the dark hallways of her house. The monsters were getting closer, their sounds becoming louder and more terrifying. Lily could hear their claws scratching against the walls.

Suddenly, she bumped into something furry and cold. It was one of the monsters! Lily let out a scream and shone her flashlight directly into its face. But to her surprise, the monster didn't attack. Instead, it seemed to cringe away from the light, whimpering in fear.

Lily realized that the monsters were afraid of the light. She flicked on all the room lights in her house and ran outside with her flashlight, shining it everywhere she could. And remarkably, the monsters just dissolved into thin air. It was as if they were nothing more than shadows.

Lily felt so relieved, knowing that her bravery and quick thinking had saved her and her family. She now knew that monsters weren't something to be feared, as long as you were brave enough to face them head-on.
