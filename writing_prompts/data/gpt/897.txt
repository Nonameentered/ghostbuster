I was only 23 the first time they tried to kill me. They were stunned when it didn't work.
I was only 23 the first time they tried to kill me. It happened quickly and without warning. I was walking home from work when I heard the sound of a car approaching. Before I knew what was happening, the car had pulled up beside me and the passenger had leaned out of the window with a gun.

I froze, not knowing what to do. But then something strange happened. The gun jammed. The person pulling the trigger cursed and fumbled with the weapon, but no matter what they did, it wouldn't fire. Finally, they gave up and the car drove away, leaving me standing there, shaken but unharmed.

At first, I thought it was just a random act of violence. But then it happened again a few weeks later. This time, it was a different group of people, but the same thing happened. The gun jammed, and they were forced to flee.

I couldn't understand why someone would want to kill me. I was just a regular person, with no enemies or connections to anything dangerous. But as the attempts on my life continued, I started to realize that there must be more to it.

Eventually, I discovered the truth: I had accidentally stumbled upon a group of criminals, and they were afraid that I would expose them to the authorities. They had decided that the best way to protect themselves was to kill me before I could talk.

But they had underestimated me. I was determined to survive, no matter what it took. I started taking self-defense classes, learning how to protect myself against physical attacks. I also began carrying pepper spray and a small knife for added protection.

And then, one day, the third attempt on my life happened. It was more violent than the others, with several individuals ambushing me on the street. But I was prepared. I fought back with everything I had, kicking and punching and using my weapons to defend myself.

To my shock, I managed to overpower them. They fled in terror, leaving me battered but victorious. I couldn't believe that I had survived.

From that day on, I knew that I was capable of anything. I had stared death in the face and come out the other side. I had shown myself and the world that I was not a victim. I was a fighter.

The attempts on my life stopped after that day. I had proven myself to be too much of a challenge for them. But even now, years later, I still remember that time in my life. It was a turning point for me, a moment where I came face to face with my own mortality and walked away victorious. And I knew that, no matter what the future held, I was ready to face it head on with courage and strength.
