Upon his suicide Hitler will join the dead waiting to be ferried across the river Styx. The dead include the millions who died in WWII. You have been tasked with keeping Hitler safe until he can arrive for his final judgment.
As a newly appointed guardian of the dead, I was given a daunting task. I was tasked with keeping Hitler safe until he could arrive for his final judgment. This task, needless to say, was not a pleasant one. Though the dead waiting to be ferried across the river Styx spanned across all walks of life, from infants lost too soon to war heroes who sacrificed their lives for the greater good, none were as hated as Adolf Hitler.

Despite my personal feelings, I knew that it was not my place to judge Hitler. He would be judged by the gods themselves, and my only role was to ensure that he made it to them safely. As much as I hate to admit it, my job was to protect Hitler.

I steeled my nerves and began my task. Hitler arrived at the banks of the Styx shortly after his suicide. Despite the shock of seeing him in person, I knew that I had to remain professional. I steered him away from the millions of souls lining up for the ferry. I had to protect him from their wrath and anger.

As we traveled down the river, Hitler remained mostly silent. I wondered what thoughts were going through his mind as he took in the sights of the underworld. Tortured souls writhed in agony, screaming for mercy. Others begged for forgiveness as they awaited their final judgment.

When we finally reached the end of our journey, I handed Hitler over to the boss himself. He was judged and punished accordingly. I knew deep down that this was the best outcome for everyone involved.

I completed my task, and now my time as a guardian of the dead was over. Though I was relieved that I wouldn't have to protect Hitler any longer, I knew that I would always be haunted by the memories of the journey down the river Styx.
