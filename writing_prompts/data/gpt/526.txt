As I walked into the dimly lit room, I was met with a faint, but distinct aura of despair. The person lying in front of me was not your typical patient - they were suffering from depression. And as a professional mixed martial arts champion, I had the unique job of beating the depression out of them.

The idea of depression manifesting into a physical form wasn't new to me. I've heard of people who were unable to walk or even get out of bed because of their mental illness. I've seen it take over people's lives and consume them completely. But somehow, my fists were the answer to this problem.

I tried not to let my feelings or emotions get in the way and focused on my job. My job was to help the person in front of me, and if that meant beating up depression, then so be it.

"Are you ready?" I asked, holding my gloved fists up. The person looked at me with eyes that were tired, but hopeful. They nodded, and I knew it was time to begin.

I started slowly, trying to ease into it. I threw some jabs and hooks at the air, letting my fists warm up. Soon enough, I was punching harder and harder, my blows landing with force against my opponent.

It was a strange feeling, hitting something that wasn't really there. But somehow, with every punch thrown, I could feel the weight of depression lifting. The person's breathing became deeper, steadier. They were holding on, and I could tell we were making progress.

We went on like that for what felt like hours, but it was only a little over an hour. I could see the physical changes, the way their muscles relaxed and their posture straightened. And then, just like that, it was over.

I took off my gloves and stood up, looking down at the person who was now sitting up, a look of relief on their face. They thanked me, and I could see they were more relaxed now, but I knew that this was not the end of their journey.

Depression is not a physical illness, and beating it into submission was not a permanent cure. It could be managed, but it could never truly be beaten. As a professional MMA champion hired to beat depression out of people, my job was to help people manage their mental health as best as possible, but I had to be realistic about what I could do.

I've won championships, medals, and trophies, but this was different. I had helped someone in a way that was strange and unconventional, but it worked. This wasn't just about winning a battle in the ring - this was about helping people win their battles in life.

As I walked out of the room, I knew that this was only the beginning. There would be more people like this one, and it would never be an easy battle. But I also knew that with time, patience, and a lot of hard work, this person and many others would be able to get better. It might not mean beating depression out of them with punches, but it would mean finding a way to manage their mental health and to live a fulfilling life.

As I stepped back into the sunlight and walked down the street, I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment. My fists might have been the answer to this person's problems, but it was their strength and resilience that truly won the fight. It was in them all along, and I was honored to help them see that.
