Once upon a time in a world far different from our own, humans were given companion animals from the age of ten. These animals developed alongside their owners, ranging from goldfish to horses to even dragons. The catch was that the animal assigned to each child was based on their behavior during childhood.

The day before her tenth birthday, Emma sat apprehensively on her bed, her parents hovering around her. They held a mysterious package wrapped in shiny paper and tied with a ribbon. "This is your companion animal, Emma,” her dad said, handing the package to her. Emma carefully unwrapped it, and her heart leaped with joy when she saw a fluffy rabbit peering up at her.

From that day on, Emma spent every waking moment with her rabbit. She named him Benny and doted on him like a mother hen. Benny was her constant companion and best friend. He followed her everywhere she went, whether it was to school, the park, or her grandmother's house.

As the years passed, Emma’s behavior changed. She became more rebellious, less patient, and more selfish, often neglecting Benny. She spent most of her time hanging out with her friends and boyfriend, forgetting that Benny was her responsibility. But Benny never left her side, even when Emma forgot about him.

Years later, Emma had graduated from college and landed a job in the city. She moved into her own apartment and, feeling lonely, she bought a puppy named Oliver. Oliver was everything Benny hadn't been: independent, assertive, and carefree. Emma loved Oliver, but he wasn't the same as Benny.

One day, Emma received news that her parents had passed away. She was devastated and felt lost in the world. All her friends and boyfriend had deserted her, and she was alone except for Oliver. That's when Emma realized the error of her ways. She had forgotten the one true friend she had in life who was always there for her: Benny.

Emma returned home, hoping that Benny would still be alive. When she entered her old home, Emma called out Benny’s name, and to her surprise, Benny hopped out of the shadows. He was old, his fur had turned grey, but he was still alive, still hopping around like a young bunny. Emma sat with him for hours, hugging him and telling him everything that had happened in her life since they last saw each other. Benny listened and licked her face in approval.

From that moment, Emma embraced Benny with open arms. She spent every day by his side, taking him on walks, and feeding him delicious treats. Emma realized that Benny was indeed a true friend, a friend who had stayed with her even when she had forgotten about him.

As more years passed, Emma realized that her childhood behavior had determined how her life would have turned out. She had neglected her most loyal friend and had taken advantage of his kindness. But Benny had helped her realize this and shown her that it's never too late to make amends.

It was time for Benny to go to a better place, and Emma was devastated when he passed away. But she knew that Benny had already given her the best lesson of her life: that unconditional love and kindness should never go unreturned, and that true friends stay with us forever because they see beyond our faults and love us for who we are.

In conclusion, the companion animals in this world were not just pets or animals; they were a mirror of their owner's behavior and personality. Emma was assigned a rabbit because it reflected the kindness and gentleness in her heart. Even though Emma had neglected Benny in her adult life, he remained loyal to her when she needed him the most. Emma learned a valuable lesson thanks to Benny, a lesson that stayed with her for the rest of her life.
