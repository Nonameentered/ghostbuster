On the triumphant last day of Obama's presidency, a vehicle flies in a streak of fire onto the White House lawn. In a disheveled, panic Bernie Sanders leaps from the DeLorean, shouting dire warnings about future.
The White House was a hive of activity, bustling with the excitement of Barack Obama's final day as President of the United States. But as the clock ticked towards midnight, a streak of fire lit up the sky, and a vehicle landed on the lawn, sending Secret Service agents scrambling for cover.

As the dust settled, a disheveled Bernie Sanders leapt out of the DeLorean, shouting dire warnings about the future. He looked panicked and unsteady, yet he was determined to be heard. Sanders had travelled far in time to deliver a warning to Barack Obama, and no one was going to stop him.

The President listened intently to Sanders' tale of climate change, income inequality, and political corruption. The story was sobering, and Obama realized that the fight for a better world was far from over. As Sanders spoke, the President felt a deep sense of responsibility wash over him â€“ a duty to use his remaining hours in office to make a lasting difference.

Together, Obama and Sanders worked on a plan to confront the challenges of the future head-on, to tackle the issues that threatened to tear the nation apart. When Obama's term was over, he left the White House a changed man, determined to continue the fight for justice and equality in the years to come. And as for Bernie, well, he disappeared as quickly as he arrived, leaving behind only the memory of a difficult but pivotal moment in American history.
