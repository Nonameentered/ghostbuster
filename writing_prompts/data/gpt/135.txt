overpopulation everything is legal until you turn 18. [WP]
In the year 2117, Earth had become an increasingly overcrowded planet. The world's population had reached a staggering 15 billion people and resources were dwindling rapidly. Governments had tried everything to control the population growth, from limiting births to enforcing strict laws on who could live where. But nothing seemed to work. As a result, a drastic decision was made: everything was legal until you turned 18.

People were allowed to do whatever they pleased, as soon as they hit the age of 18. All laws were lifted, and the government had no jurisdiction over actions taken by those in this age group. This decision had been made to control the escalating population; by allowing individuals to live however they wanted for eighteen years, it was thought that most people would not survive long enough to contribute to the overcrowding. But what the government did not anticipate was the extent of the chaos that would come with such a decision.

Nathan was a sixteen-year-old boy who lived with his parents in a small apartment in one of the more affluent parts of the city. His parents had always been strict and had shielded him from the harsh reality outside. They had kept him in the dark, hoping he would never discover what was happening in the world around him. But Nathan was a curious youth. He had heard rumors and whispers among his peers about the mayhem that occurred once people turned 18. Nathan couldn't help but wonder what it would be like for himself.

The day finally arrived when Nathan turned 18. He woke up early, knowing that his life would never be the same again. He packed a small bag and left a note for his parents, informing them of his departure. He was filled with excitement and fear, not knowing what the future held for him. He stepped out of his apartment into the bustling city. It was a place where people were free to do what they wanted, and it showed.

The streets were filled with young people, some partying, others engaging in various forms of debauchery. The noise was deafening, and the smells were overwhelming. For a moment, Nathan stood frozen, taking it all in. He felt overwhelmed, and his fear grew with every passing moment.

A group of teenagers approached Nathan, and one of them, a girl with piercings all over her face, asked him, "Are you new to these streets?"

Nathan nodded, feeling embarrassed.

The girl smiled at him. "Come with us. Let us show you around."

Nathan was grateful for her kindness and joined the group. They took him to a bar where he met more people his age. As the night went on, Nathan drank more and more, and his inhibitions began to fade away. He lost himself in the music, the people, and the atmosphere. He was finally living the life he had always wanted.

But things soon took a turn. Nathan found himself in a dark alleyway with a group of strangers. They were encouraging him to take drugs, to have sex, to do anything he wanted. And that's when Nathan realized the true cost of the world's decision. By taking away all restrictions and laws, people had become animals. There was no sense of morality or respect. Nathan felt a sense of fear that he had never felt before, and he wanted to run, but he knew he couldn't.

As the group of strangers got more aggressive, Nathan tried to push them away, but it was too late. They had already taken everything from him. His money, his bag, and his innocence. Nathan was left alone in that alleyway, beaten and bruised, wondering what kind of world he had entered.

For the next few days, Nathan wandered the streets, unsure of what to do. He saw more and more examples of the world's madness. People were killing each other, stealing from each other, and engaging in all kinds of criminal activity. It was a world without rules, one that Nathan didn't want to be a part of. Nathan realized that the decision to remove all laws was a mistake. It had created a world where only the strong survived, and the weak were left to die.

One day, Nathan stumbled upon a group of individuals who had decided to band together, to form their own laws and hold each other accountable. They had established a small community where everyone had a role to play. There was a sense of order in the chaos. Nathan was intrigued and decided to join them.

As the months went on, Nathan found himself more and more invested in this new way of life. He helped build shelters, hunt for food, and protect the community from those who wanted to destroy it. He realized that a society without rules was a society without hope, but a society with values and laws could thrive.

The world had thought that by lifting all laws and restrictions, they would control the population growth. But in reality, it had only led to chaos, fear, and destruction. Nathan learned that laws were necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of all individuals. The world could not survive without them.

In conclusion, the decision to lift all laws until the age of 18 had created a world filled with distrust, violence, and fear. Nathan had discovered that a society needed laws and values to thrive. The world needed law and order to maintain a civilized society. The decision to remove all laws had been a mistake, but Nathan had learned that there was hope, and that communities could be established based on mutual respect and cooperation. Nathan had found a new family, one that he was proud to be a part of, one that had given him a purpose and a sense of belonging.
