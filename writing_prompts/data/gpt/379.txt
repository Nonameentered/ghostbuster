Every time you get sick in this life, it means you just died on another universe. Right now everyone on earth is ill but you.
I always thought it was odd that every time I got sick, everyone else around me seemed to have the same symptoms. It was like there was some sort of flu going around, except it only ever affected me and those close to me. I never gave it much thought, though. I just figured that's how it was for everyone.

But then, one day, everything changed.

I woke up feeling perfectly fine, but as soon as I turned on the news, I realized something was wrong. Every channel was reporting the same thing: a deadly virus was sweeping across the world, and millions of people were already infected.

I sat there in shock, unable to believe what I was hearing. How could this be happening? How could I be the only one who wasn't sick?

As the days passed, the situation only got worse. The virus was relentless, spreading faster than anyone could contain it. Hospitals were filling up, supplies were running low, and the death toll was rising by the hour.

And still, I remained unaffected.

At first, I was grateful. I was relieved that I wouldn't have to suffer like everyone else, that I wouldn't have to experience the pain and fear that came with the virus. But as time went on, my relief turned to guilt. Why was I immune, while so many others suffered and died?

I tried to find answers. I talked to doctors, scientists, even spiritual leaders, but no one could explain why this was happening. Some speculated that I had some sort of natural immunity, but others suggested something more sinister: that I was somehow responsible for the virus, that I had caused it to spread so quickly.

I knew this couldn't be true. I had never done anything to intentionally harm anyone, and I couldn't imagine how I could be responsible for a global pandemic. But still, the accusations lingered, and I began to feel like a pariah.

Despite my guilt and confusion, I tried to do what I could to help. I donated money to relief organizations, offered my time to volunteer, and even tried to share my immunity with others. But nothing seemed to make a difference. The virus continued to rage on, and people continued to die.

And then, one day, something strange happened.

I was walking through the park when I suddenly felt a sharp pain in my chest. It was like someone had plunged a knife into my heart, and for a brief moment, I couldn't breathe.

As quickly as it came, the pain disappeared, leaving me feeling weak and shaky. I sat down on a nearby bench, trying to catch my breath, when a woman walked up to me.

"Excuse me," she said, her eyes filled with tears. "But my husband died of the virus this morning. He was your age, and he looked just like you."

I was taken aback. "I'm sorry," I said, not knowing what else to say.

"Can I ask you something?" she said, leaning in close. "Did you feel that pain just now? In your chest?"

I nodded, still trying to recover from the shock.

"That's how it starts," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "That's how you know you're about to get sick. I felt it too, when my husband died."

It was like a jolt of electricity went through my body. I couldn't believe what she was saying. Was it possible? Was I really connected to this virus in some way?

I went home that night feeling numb. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, couldn't think about anything except this strange new reality. And then, just as suddenly as the pain had come, it was gone. I felt fine again, like nothing had ever happened.

But I knew it wasn't over. I knew that somewhere, on some other universe, I had just died of this virus. And I knew that every time I got sick in this life, it meant that another version of me had died too.

It was a sobering thought, but also a comforting one. As long as I remained healthy, I knew that I was doing my part to keep other versions of myself alive, to keep them from suffering the same fate.

And so, I carried on, trying to live my life as best I could. I never forgot about the pain in my chest, or the millions of people who had died from this virus. But I also never forgot that I was the only one who could keep it from happening again.
