I had always felt different from everyone else since I was young. I never knew exactly what it was, but it felt as if something had always been missing within me. That feeling only intensified after my sixteenth birthday. Up until that day, I had never gotten sick, no flu, no colds, nothing, and no one else had either. Sickness had never existed in our world.

The day everything shifted was supposed to be a grand celebration. Everyone was gathered in the center of the city to celebrate my birthday. The sun was shining on my face as I stood on the stage, feeling proud of everything I had accomplished in life. My family and friends were in attendance, and they all looked happy and carefree. It was the happiest day of my life.

But then it started, a deep feeling of nausea and vertigo that made me feel like I was going to lose my footing. I tried to brush it off, thinking that it was just because of the high they had put me on to honor me. However, the feeling wouldn't go away; it just kept getting worse and worse. I began to feel hot and cold all at once. It was like my body was trying to tell me that something was wrong, but I couldn't seem to pinpoint what it was.

The nausea became so severe that I had to excuse myself from the stage. My family and friends followed me, worried that something might be terribly wrong with me since I had never been sick before. I remember walking down the road, leaning heavily on my mother's shoulder. I felt as if I was dying, even though I didn't understand what was happening.

As soon as I got home, the sickness intensified. I was sweating profusely, and my body was shaking uncontrollably. My entire body felt like it was collapsing in on itself, with aches and pains in places that I didn't even know existed. It was a torment that only continued to get worse and worse as the hours wore on.

It was then that I discovered that I was the first person in the history of our world to have become sick.

My family and friends were completely at a loss as to what to do. The doctors had no idea what to do since they had never dealt with sickness before. I was dying, and I knew it, and there seemed to be nothing anyone could do about it. My body burned with hurt, and nobody could understand what I was experiencing.

As days went by, I continued to get worse and worse, my symptoms maddening in their severity. I lost all energy and could barely move from my bed. The doctors tried their best, but without past experience with illness, they were completely ineffective. The only thing they could do was to keep me comfortable as I lost myself to the sickness.

My parents couldn't bear to watch me slip away, so they tried to find an answer outside of our world. They discovered that there had been other worlds with the same sickness that I had, and they began researching everything they could to find a cure.

After months of constant research and consultations with specialists from other worlds, my parents finally found a solution. It wasn't a cure, but it would help me live with my sickness. They began treating me with weekly injections that could control the worst symptoms, making me feel as normal as possible. 

My family struggled to adjust to my new way of life, but we all slowly adapted to the new changes. My life was no longer one of healthy normalcy, but of a new normal where I had to be dependent on medication to live. Regardless, I was grateful for every day that I got to experience, surrounded by people that loved and cared about me.

So while I am different from everyone else in the world, I have finally come to accept it. I know that I might never be completely normal again, but I have learned that being different isn't always a bad thing. It's just life's way of throwing you a curveball, forcing you to embrace something new and unexpected. And with that, I have learned to live.
