You wake up one morning to find that you have written a disturbing note to yourself, and you don't remember how, when, or why.
I woke up one morning to find a note on my bedside table. It was written in my handwriting, but I couldn't remember writing it. The note said, "You know what you did. Don't think you can get away with it."

My heart raced as I tried to recall what the note could be referring to. What did I do? Did I hurt someone? Did I break the law? I couldn't remember anything.

I searched my phone and laptop for any clues, but there was nothing. I even asked my friends and family if they noticed anything different about me, but they all said I seemed normal.

Days went by, and the note consumed my every thought. I couldn't focus on anything else. I was paranoid that someone was watching me, waiting to expose me for whatever it was that I did.

One day, as I was walking to work, I noticed a man following me. I quickened my pace, but he followed. I turned around and confronted him, demanding to know who he was and why he was following me.

He introduced himself as a private investigator hired by my employer. Apparently, they received an anonymous tip accusing me of stealing company information and selling it to our competition.

I was shocked. I knew I didn't do it, but my memory was so hazy that I started to doubt myself.

After a thorough investigation, it was proven that I was innocent. It turned out that the note I found was a cruel prank played by one of my colleagues.

I was angry and relieved at the same time. I couldn't believe someone would do something like that. However, it was a wake-up call for me to pay closer attention to my actions and to always be aware of what's happening around me.
