You're an end-game level 50 god in the underworld. A new level 1 player is pestering you by hitting your ankle with a wooden sword.
As an end-game level 50 god in the underworld, Naxir had many things to do, from managing the world's economy to figuring out who would go to where after death. Despite everything that he had to do, he never ignored his worshippers, for they were the ones that gave him strength.

Each day, Naxir listened to his worshippers' prayers and guided them with his divine powers. However, one day, something unusual happened. A new level 1 player distracted Naxir from his duties by hitting him on the ankle with his wooden sword.

Naxir looked down and saw the young player staring back at him with a gleeful expression.

"What do you want?" Naxir asked, his voice rumbling throughout the underworld.

"I wanna fight!" the player yelled, his eyes filled with excitement.

Naxir raised his eyebrows. He never enjoyed violence, but if the player wanted to play, he would not stop him.

"Fine," Naxir said, "but first, tell me your name."

The player hesitated, looking up at Naxir with a shocked expression.

"I-I'm sorry, great Naxir. I didn't mean to trespass on your time," he said.

Naxir sighed, deciding to put on a more friendly face.

"You're not trespassing, little one," Naxir said, smiling warmly. "I'm just curious about your name."

The player finally relaxed a bit and said, "My name is Jack. I may be level 1, but I'm going to be the greatest warrior of the underworld!"

"Is that so?" Naxir said, amused.

Jack nodded enthusiastically, holding his wooden sword high.

"Well, let's see what you're made of," Naxir said, gesturing for Jack to attack.

Jack ran towards Naxir, his wooden sword swinging wildly. However, Naxir's years of experience and battle strategy easily took over and he dodged and maneuvered himself around Jack's attacks.

After a few minutes of sparring, Jack began to tire and stumbled back a bit.

Naxir, seeing the opportunity, moved in for the finishing blow, but stopped himself when he saw Jack's let out a whimper.

"Are you alright?" Naxir asked, his voice softening.

Jack nodded, wiping away tears that had unknowingly formed in his eyes.

"I just wanted to be strong like you, Naxir," he said, his voice cracking.

Naxir paused, looking down at the young boy. He remembered being like him once, seeing a powerful god and wanting to be just as strong.

"No one can be like me, little one," Naxir said, crouching down to Jack's level. "But that doesn't mean you can't be your own kind of strong."

"How?" Jack asked, his childish curiosity showing.

"By practicing every day, learning new skills, and pushing your limit. And most importantly, never giving up," Naxir said, tapping Jack's nose lightly.

Jack looked up at Naxir, a newfound determination slowly replacing the sadness in his eyes.

"I'll do that, Naxir," he said, his voice filled with newfound hope. "Thank you."

Naxir smiled, and with a flick of his wrist, he sent Jack back to the mortal realm. As he walked back to his throne, Naxir couldn't help but feel proud of himself for helping a young warrior find his path.

Since that day, Jack visited Naxir often to spar and learn different skills. And each time, Naxir was impressed with Jack's progress. It wasn't long before Jack had surpassed many players in the underworld and became known as one of the greatest warriors of his time.

Years later, Naxir found Jack at his doorstep, clad in armor made of the finest materials.

"Naxir! I've come to thank you for everything, and to challenge you to one final fight!" Jack said, his eyes shining bright with excitement.

Naxir raised an eyebrow, but couldn't help but feel a sense of pride at seeing how far Jack had come.

"Alright, little one," Naxir said, "let's see if you've got what it takes."

The fight lasted for hours, with each side giving and taking blows. Naxir was impressed by Jack's skill and strength. However, in the end, Naxir emerged the victor, but only due to his decades of experience.

Jack fell to his knees, panting heavily, but grinning from ear-to-ear.

"You're still the greatest, Naxir. But one day, I'll reach your level," Jack said, holding out his hand for Naxir to take.

Naxir took Jack's hand, and with a shake, he felt a sense of satisfaction sweep over him. To have been able to help guide a young warrior to greatness was a feeling that could not be measured or quantified.

Years passed, and Naxir watched as Jack grew old. Many players in the underworld came and went, but Jack remained a constant, always pushing himself to be the best.

And as Jack approached death, he thanked Naxir once more for his guidance and for the many battles they had fought.

"If I see you on the other side, I'll challenge you to one last fight," Jack said, a smile on his face.

Naxir laughed, "Be sure to prepare yourself, then."

As Jack passed into the mortal realm, Naxir couldn't help but feel satisfied. He had done his part in shaping the underworld's history, and he looked forward to whatever new challenge the future held.
