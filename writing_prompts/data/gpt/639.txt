The day had finally arrived. The day that the last human would leave Earth. It had been two long and grueling decades since the first wave of humans had left the planet. They had been searching for new homes in the far reaches of space. It had been an uneasy decision, but one that humanity had taken in order to preserve themselves.

As the final rocket prepared for launch, there were a few who had stayed behind. They were the ones who had decided that they could not leave Earth. They were the ones who had decided to stay and watch the planet become human-free.

The last human, a young girl named Ava, stood on the launch pad. She felt a sense of sadness wash over her as she realized that she was the last person to leave Earth. She had always known that this day would come, but it felt surreal to actually be standing on the launch pad, watching as the countdown began.

10…9…8…7…6…5…4…3…2…1

The rocket launched into the sky, leaving behind a trail of fire and smoke. Ava watched as the planet slowly diminished in size. Tears streamed down her face as she said goodbye to the only home she had ever known. She knew that she would never see Earth again.

As the rocket disappeared from view, Ava turned to face the group of people who had stayed behind. They were standing in silence, watching as the rocket disappeared into the darkness of space. Ava walked over to them and stood in silence.

"What happens now?" Ava asked.

"We wait," one of the men replied. "We wait for the planet to heal itself, to become human-free."

It was going to take time for Earth to recover. It was going to take years, possibly even centuries. But the people who had stayed behind knew that they had made the right decision. They had decided to sacrifice their own lives so that future generations could have the opportunity to live in a world free of human influence.

As the days turned into weeks and the weeks turned into months, the people who had stayed behind began to rebuild the planet. They started by planting trees and flowers. They repaired damaged ecosystems and removed the pollution that humans had left behind.

It was a slow process, but every day, the planet showed signs of recovery. The air was cleaner, the water was clearer, and the animals were thriving. It was a world that was slowly being reborn, a world that was free of the scars that humans had left behind.

Years turned into decades, and the people who had stayed behind continued to work tirelessly to make the planet a better place. They had faced many challenges and setbacks along the way, but they refused to give up. They knew that they were doing something that was far greater than themselves.

Finally, after several decades of hard work, the day arrived when Earth was declared human-free. It was a monumental moment, one that brought tears to the eyes of everyone who had stayed behind. They had accomplished something that no one thought was possible. They had given the planet a chance to heal itself, to recover from the damage that humans had caused.

As the people who had stayed behind looked out at their world, they felt a sense of pride and accomplishment. They knew that they had done something that few people had ever done. They had given up their own lives so that the planet could live.

In the end, it was a sacrifice that was worth it. They had created a world that was free of the scars that humans had left behind. A world that was pure and untouched by human influence. It was a world that would one day be inhabited by a new species, a species that would have the opportunity to live in a world that was free of the mistakes and shortcomings of humanity.
