Time has stopped for all but one person. What is the rest of that person's life like?
Samantha was the only person on the world who could move. Every one and everything else had stopped in its tracks. No cars moved, no birds chirped.

Frozen in time, Samantha wandered aimlessly through the eerily still city. The world had been like this for days, and Samantha had already explored every building and street. The once bright city felt dull and lifeless now. Samantha wondered if she were the last person alive.

As she meandered through the city, she found others like her frozen in time. A couple enjoying a meal on a rooftop restaurant, a group of children playing in a playground, and a man sleeping on a park bench. She wondered what had happened to them and if they were aware of their fate?

Days turned into weeks, and Samantha had grown used to being the only one who could move. She had always been curious but found herself feeling lonely. She missed the sound of laughter, the conversations of passersby and the bustle of life around her.

One day, as she was looking out into the frozen skyline, something caught her eye. It was a man in the distance slowly walking in her direction. She watched confused and unsure of what to do.

As he finally approached, he too started to move in slow motion like everything else in the city. Samantha realized that even the clock had stopped, and it was as if time itself had stopped.

The man's name was William, and he was a physicist. He had been working on a theory about time travel, and his experiment had accidently caused time to stop entirely. William and Samantha tried everything they could, but nothing seemed to work.

Days turned into months, and the two of them found themselves growing closer. They explored the city together, discovering new places and learning about each other.

Eventually, William determined he could reverse what he had done. It was risky but Samantha trusted him. After extensive research and experiments, they were finally ready.

As they stood in the middle of the street, William flipped a switch. For a moment, the world flickered, and then everything started moving again, and time resumed.

The city was alive once more, and Samantha was no longer alone. She hugged William tightly, thankful for his determination and grateful that she had someone to go forward with. Life was back to normal.
