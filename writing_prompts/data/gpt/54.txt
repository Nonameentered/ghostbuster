A man hires a hit man on himself, with a note saying 'This will not be easy.'
Maxwell had always known that he was not like other people. He had a sense of unease that gnawed at his heart, a fear that twisted his gut and made his fingers shake. He could never put a finger on exactly what it was that set him apart, but he knew that it was something dark, something dangerous.

For years, Maxwell had struggled to keep his demons at bay. He tried religion, therapy, medication, but nothing seemed to work. He was haunted by thoughts of his own death, by visions of the future that always ended with his own blood on the floor. He knew that he was a danger to himself and to everyone around him, and he couldn't take it anymore.

One day, he decided to take action. He picked up a pen and a piece of paper and wrote a note. "I want to hire someone to kill me," he wrote. "This will not be easy."

Maxwell stared at the letter for a long time, his heart pounding in his chest. He knew that this was a dangerous game, that he was playing with fire, but he also knew that it was his only option. He put the letter in an envelope and left it on the table, and then he went to bed and tried to sleep. But his dreams were full of ghosts and demons, and he woke up more exhausted than ever.

The next day, Maxwell checked his phone and found a new message waiting for him. "We need to talk," it read. There was no name attached to the message, but Maxwell knew exactly who it was from. He texted back, agreeing to meet at a nearby park.

When Maxwell got there, he saw a man sitting on a bench, smoking a cigarette. He was tall and lean, with pale skin and dark hair. He looked up when Maxwell approached, and Maxwell could see the intensity in his eyes.

"You want me to kill you?" the man said, his voice low and rough.

Maxwell nodded. "I know it's crazy," he said. "But I can't live like this anymore. I'm a danger to myself and to everyone around me. I need to die."

The man studied him for a long moment, then took a drag on his cigarette. "This won't be easy," he said. "You know that, right?"

Maxwell nodded again. "I know. But I can't back out now. I need you to do this for me."

The man stood up and tossed his cigarette on the ground. "Fine," he said. "But there are rules. I'll give you one week to change your mind. If you haven't changed your mind by then, I'll do the job. But you have to understand that I won't make it easy for you. I'll make you suffer."

Maxwell shuddered at the man's words, but he knew that he had no choice. He agreed to the rules and handed over an envelope full of cash.

For the next week, Maxwell tried to live as if nothing had changed. He went to work, he saw his friends, he went to the gym. But all the while, he felt a sense of impending doom looming over him. Every time he thought about the man he had hired, he felt a surge of fear and anticipation. He tried to imagine what it would feel like to die, to have someone take his life from him. But he couldn't imagine anything at all.

On the seventh day, Maxwell woke up to find a note on his kitchen table. "Time's up," it read.

He knew what he had to do. He got dressed, put on his shoes, and left his apartment. He walked down the street, his heart pounding in his chest. He felt a sense of desperation rising in him, a sense of urgency that overrode everything else. He had to find the man he had hired and try to talk him out of it.

Maxwell went to the park where he had met the man before, but he wasn't there. He searched for hours, wandering through the city, but he couldn't find any trace of him. He began to panic, to feel as if he was running out of time. He knew that he had to find the man before it was too late.

Finally, he found himself outside an old warehouse on the outskirts of town. He could see a light glowing in one of the windows, and he knew that it was the man he was looking for. He took a deep breath and walked inside.

The man was waiting for him, smoking a cigarette as always. He looked up when Maxwell came in, and his expression was unreadable.

"I changed my mind," Maxwell said, his voice shaking. "I don't want to die. I can't go through with it."

The man looked at him for a long time, then took another drag on his cigarette. "It's too late," he said. "I've already started."

Maxwell felt a cold hand wrap around his heart. He knew that he was too late, that there was nothing he could do to stop the man now. He closed his eyes and waited for the end.
