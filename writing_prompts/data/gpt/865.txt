Hi! I'm the main character! Or so you would have me be. I want you to know that no matter what you write, I refuse to be the main character in your little game and will avoid any instance where you try to put me into a situation that does so.

My name is Sarah, and I am a very private person. I prefer to be left alone and mind my own business. I don't want anyone to know about me, and I don't want to be the center of attention. But one day, I found myself in a situation that I couldn't avoid.

It was a beautiful day, and I was walking in the park when I saw a little girl crying. I couldn't ignore her, so I went over to see what was wrong. She had lost her parents, and she was all alone. I couldn't leave her there, so I took her to the police station. They took her in and found her parents after a few hours.

The next day, I saw my picture in the newspaper with the headline, "Hero saves lost girl." I was horrified. I didn't want to be a hero; I just wanted to help a little girl. But now everyone knew me, and people were thanking me and wanting to take pictures with me.

From that day on, I avoided any situation where I could be the main character in someone else's story. I didn't want fame or attention; I just wanted to live my life quietly and help people in my own way.
