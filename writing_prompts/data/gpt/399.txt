The world had changed a lot since the Great War that ravaged the planet, and even more so since the global pandemic that followed it. People now lived in a utopia of sorts, where everything was regulated and controlled. The world had moved on from the chaos and destruction of the past, but at a cost. The cost of freedom and choice.

One of the fundamental changes that had taken place in the world was the role of doctors. In this dystopian future, doctors were expected to euthanize sick patients. The reasoning behind this was simple – it was much cheaper and more efficient to put a patient out of their misery than to prolong their suffering.

Dr. Monique Ducasse had always been uncomfortable with the idea of euthanizing patients. She had become a doctor to help people, not to end their lives. Despite this, she had been able to convince herself that it was for the greater good. That was until she met Thomas.

Thomas was a young man who had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He had been in a lot of pain and had begged Dr. Ducasse to end his suffering. However, the doctor saw something in him that made her believe that he could survive. She had seen the same spark in herself when she was younger, before the world had changed.

Against all protocol and expectations, Dr. Ducasse decided to treat Thomas. She knew that she was taking a huge risk, and that if she failed, there would be dire consequences. But she couldn't bring herself to euthanize him – not when he still had a chance, no matter how slim that chance might be.

Dr. Ducasse worked tirelessly to make Thomas' life as comfortable as possible while administering aggressive treatments. Her colleagues looked upon her with disdain, whispering behind her back about how she was risking the health of other patients. But the doctor didn't care.

Despite initial resistance, Thomas began to respond to the treatment. He slowly began to gain strength, and his outlook improved. Dr. Ducasse was elated. Her efforts were paying off, and the patient of whom she had taken a chance was getting better.

The road to recovery was long and difficult, but with Dr. Ducasse's expertise and dedication, Thomas eventually made a full recovery. He was discharged a month later, much to the amazement and shock of everyone, except Dr. Ducasse, who had seen the potential in him all along. 

The news of her success spread quickly throughout the medical world, and many doctors reached out to her to learn more about her techniques. But Dr. Ducasse remained humble, and refused to claim any special abilities. She knew that it was her belief in Thomas that made the difference, not any fancy medical procedures.

While Dr. Ducasse's actions undoubtedly saved Thomas' life, they also raised difficult questions about the ethics of euthanasia. If a patient was given a chance to fight their illness, shouldn't they be given that chance? The world Dr. Ducasse lived in seemed to place much more weight on the value of efficient, cost-effective measures than the value of life, no matter how sickly the patient was.

Dr. Ducasse's success marked a shift in the world, where the value of human life was beginning to be placed above all else. It was a glimmer of hope in an otherwise dark world. 

As for Thomas, he kept in touch with Dr. Ducasse, and the two developed a close bond. He was grateful to her for giving him another chance at life and for helping him see that what he had thought was a hopeless situation, was not. Thomas began to live his life with this newfound appreciation and fervor, even developing a philosophy blog that expounded on the belief that life should be cherished no matter its quality.

Dr. Ducasse had broken down the barrier of engrained thinking in the medical field, by being the first to save someone in a hundred years. It was an immense responsibility, one that she bore with honor. She hoped that her success would inspire others to follow in her path, and that they too would see the value in giving patients a chance to live.
