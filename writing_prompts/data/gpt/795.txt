The source of Modor the Destructor's power is an inquisitive 2 year old. Modor isn't sure it's worth it.
Modor, the Destructor, had always been one of the most powerful beings in all the realms. His power was unmatched, and his influence was felt across the universe. But what most people didn't know was that Modor's power had an unexpected source: an inquisitive 2-year-old.

Modor had stumbled upon the child during one of his many conquests. The child's curiosity had drawn Modor's attention, and he had taken the child under his wing. At first, Modor was annoyed by the child's incessant questioning and meddling with his powers. But soon he realized that the child's simple questions were actually making him more powerful.

Modor's power had always been fueled by destruction and chaos. But the child's innocent questions about the world around them gave him new perspectives, new ideas, and new ways to harness his destructive abilities.

As Modor sat in his throne room, pondering the role of the child in his power, he couldn't help but feel conflicted. Was the child's influence worth the constant barrage of questions and interruptions?

Modor knew that he had a decision to make. He could choose to keep the child by his side and embrace the new sources of power they had brought him. Or he could cast the child out and return to his old, destructive ways.

Ultimately, Modor couldn't bring himself to abandon the child. For better or for worse, the inquisitive 2-year-old was now a part of his life, and Modor knew that his power would never be the same.
