'See the problem is: deep down inside, I'm still an asshole.'
See, the problem is: deep down inside, I'm still an asshole. I know this to be true, but I can't help myself. I've tried to be a kind and decent person, but it's like a switch flips in my brain, and suddenly my natural instincts take over.

I first realized this when I was in high school. I had a girlfriend who I really cared about, but I couldn't help but cheat on her. I knew it was wrong, but I enjoyed the thrill of getting away with something. Eventually, she found out and broke up with me. I was devastated, but I couldn't blame her.

As I got older, I tried to be a better person. I volunteered, I donated to charity, and I tried to be good to the people in my life. But there was always a part of me that was selfish and cruel. I would lash out at my friends and family for no reason, and I couldn't explain why.

It wasn't until a few years ago that I finally figured out what was wrong with me. I went to therapy and was diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder. It was a relief to finally have a name for what I was going through. But it didn't make it any easier to change.

I still struggle with my behavior every day. It's like there's a demon inside me that I can't exorcise. But I haven't given up hope. I continue to see a therapist, and I try to be aware of my behavior and how it affects others.

At the end of the day, I know that I'll always be an asshole to some degree. But I won't let it define me. I'll keep fighting to be a better person, even if it's an uphill battle. Because deep down, I know that's what really matters.
