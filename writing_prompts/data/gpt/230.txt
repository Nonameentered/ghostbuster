The world was ending. Buildings crumbled, roads were torn apart and fires burned on every street corner. It was as if the apocalypse had finally come, and there was no stopping it.

As the superhero flew over the city, he couldn't help but feel defeated. He had tried everything in his power to prevent this disaster, but it was as if fate had other plans. It was then that he realized that the villain he had been fighting had been right all along.

He remembered their last conversation, where the villain had warned him about the impending doom, saying that it was impossible to stop what was coming. Back then, the superhero had been dismissive, thinking that the villain was just trying to deceive him. But now, as he surveyed the destruction that surrounded him, it became clear that the villain had been right all along.

The superhero felt a pang of regret as he thought about all the times he had fought against the villain, believing that he was the sole cause of the city's problems. He realized that he had been so blinded by his own belief that he failed to see the bigger picture. He had always thought that by defeating the villain, he was saving the world. But he was wrong.

The world was ending, and there was nothing he could do to stop it. All he could do now was try to lessen the damage and help those who were in need. It was a bitter pill to swallow, knowing that he had been wrong all this time. But he had to face the consequences of his actions, and try to make amends.

He flew towards the centre of the destruction, with a heavy heart and a newfound respect for the one he had always seen as his enemy. They may have been at odds before, but now they were united against a common enemy. One that couldn't be defeated, no matter how hard they tried.
