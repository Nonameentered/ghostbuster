As long as you rhyme you will be pardoned of all crimes commited while defending yourself in court.
In the small town of Oakville, the justice system was quite peculiar. For centuries, it had been a tradition that as long as you rhymed during your defense, you would be pardoned of all crimes committed while defending yourself in court.

One day, a young farmer named Jack was brought to court. He was accused of stealing a cow from his neighbor, Bill. Jack didn't steal the cow, but he knew that Bill was a greedy man who wanted to settle a score.

As Jack stood before the judge, he prepared himself to defend his innocence. He took a deep breath and began to rhyme.

"Your honor, I swear on my farm, I did not steal from Bill's barn. I love my cow Betsy, loyal as can be, I would never let her wander, and Bill knows this to a tee."

The judge was impressed by Jack's clever rhymes. He listened closely to his defense and found no evidence of wrongdoing. He then declared Jack pardoned of all charges.

From that day on, Jack became known throughout the town as a master of rhyme. Whenever someone was brought to court, they would seek out Jack's advice on how to recite their defense in rhyme.

One day, a group of thieves were brought to court for a string of robberies that had occurred around town. The judge listened to their defense, but he was not convinced they were telling the truth.

Just as the judge was about to pass his judgment, Jack stood up and offered to help the thieves.

He walked up to the judge and began to rhyme.

"Your honor, these men may have a past, but they're not the ones who stole the last. They may be rough around the edges, but they're not the ones who broke into the hedges."

The judge was surprised at Jack's boldness, but he couldn't deny the power of his words. He declared the thieves pardoned of all charges and praised Jack for his brave and clever defense.

And so, the tradition of defense by rhyme continued in Oakville, enshrined in the town's history and culture. Anyone who dared to break the law knew that they could always count on their wit and the power of rhyme to set themselves free.
