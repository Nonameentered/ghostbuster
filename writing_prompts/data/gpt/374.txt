A man goes to the bathroom, and while he looks in the mirror while washing his hands, he discovers that his reflection is slightly out of sync.
Tom opened the bathroom door and walked in. He turned on the tap and began to wash his hands. He looked up at the mirror as he did so, and saw something odd. At first, he thought it was his imagination, but when he looked back up, he noticed that his reflection was slightly out of sync with his movements. 

Tom rubbed his eyes and shook his head, but the image in the mirror remained the same. He moved his hand to his face, and his reflection moved his hand to his cheek a bit too late. Tom began to feel a little uneasy. He stepped back from the sink and looked at his reflection. 

The reflection itself didn't seem odd or distorted, and his movements seemed to be precise. However, it was clear that his reflection was a fraction of a second behind his every movement. 

Tom couldn't shake the feeling that it was some sort of joke or prank. He tried looking closer at the mirror to see if he could catch someone moving behind him, but there was no one there. As he continued staring at his reflection, he noticed that his reflection had begun to do strange things, like fidget and twitch. 

Tom started to feel anxious and unnerved. He walked out of the bathroom to see if anyone else had noticed what was happening. No one seemed to be aware of anything. As he paced back and forth, Tom wondered if he had lost his mind. 

He decided to go back into the bathroom and take a closer look at his reflection. This time, he studied it closely, paying attention to every little detail. As he did so, he noticed that something strange was going on with his reflection's eyes. They seemed to be moving independently of each other, looking off in different directions. 

Tom took a step back from the mirror, startled. The reflection continued to twitch and fidget. This time, however, it wasn't just slightly out of sync - it was completely out of sync! 

Tom stumbled back out of the bathroom, feeling dizzy and disoriented. He didn't know what to do. Had he somehow entered some sort of surreal universe that he couldn't escape from? Was he starting to lose his mind? 

Tom couldn't get the image of his reflection out of his head. He spent the entire day feeling out of sorts and disconnected from reality. He continued to feel unnerved, wondering if this was some sort of elaborate prank or if something deeper and more sinister was going on. He couldn't shake the feeling that he was trapped in a nightmare.
