: your seventh son is fated to murder you. You laugh until you remember you used to donate sperm.
Growing up, I always wanted a large family. So when my wife and I had our seventh son, we were overjoyed. But then a strange feeling came over me, a feeling that something wasn't right. I brushed it off as new parent jitters and carried on with my life as normal.

As the years went by and my sons grew into young men, that uneasy feeling kept gnawing at me. I couldn't shake the thought that one of my sons was fated to kill me. It seemed ridiculous, of course. They were all so sweet and loving. But the feeling persisted.

I tried to talk to my wife about it, but she brushed it off as well. "You're just being paranoid," she said. "Our boys would never do anything like that." And I believed her, for a time.

But then strange things started happening around the house. My wife's favorite vase would mysteriously shatter in the middle of the night. The car would inexplicably run out of gas. And then, one day, I found a strange note in my office.

It was written in a spidery scrawl, and it simply said: "You will die by your own blood." My heart dropped to my stomach as I realized that my fears were coming true. One of my sons was going to kill me.

I tried to confront them about it, but they all denied knowing anything about the note or the other strange happenings. I was at a loss for what to do, and the fear was overwhelming.

One day, I was in the kitchen chopping vegetables when my youngest son, Caleb, walked in. He was always my favorite, with his curly hair and his mischievous grin. He looked up at me with those big brown eyes and said, "Dad, can we talk?"

"Of course, son," I said, putting down the knife.

"I've been having theseâ€¦ thoughts," he said hesitantly.

"What kind of thoughts?"

"Bad thoughts," he said, looking down at his hands. "About hurting people. Especially you."

My heart stopped. Could it really be Caleb? My sweet little boy?

"I don't know what to do," he said, tears welling up in his eyes.

I took a deep breath. "Well, the first thing we need to do is get you some help," I said gently. "We'll go see a doctor, and we'll figure out what's going on."

Caleb nodded gratefully, and we hugged. But as I held him in my arms, I couldn't shake the feeling of dread that had settled in my gut.

Later that night, as my wife and I were discussing our options, something occurred to me. "Wait a minute," I said. "I used to donate sperm."

My wife looked at me in confusion. "What does that have to do with anything?"

"Well, what if Caleb isn't really my son?"

We dug out the old paperwork and started making calls. It took several weeks, but eventually, we found out the truth. Caleb wasn't biologically related to me.

We were relieved and horrified all at once. Relieved that our sweet little boy wasn't the one fated to kill me, but horrified that one of my biological sons still was.

As we sat around the dinner table that night, I couldn't help but look at my sons with a new level of suspicion. Which one of them could it be?

But then again, maybe it wasn't any of them. Maybe it was just a silly superstition. Either way, I knew I couldn't go on living in fear.

So I made a radical decision. I would confront my fears head-on by inviting all of my sons over for a family dinner. And I would put the curse to the test.

As we passed around plates of food and chatted about old times, I studied my sons' faces carefully. Who would be the one to strike the killing blow?

But as the night wore on and nothing out of the ordinary happened, I started to relax. Maybe it was all in my head after all.

It wasn't until later that night, when I was alone in my bedroom, that the truth hit me. It wasn't any of my sons that was fated to kill me. It was me.

I had always been a thrill-seeker, drawn to danger and excitement. And as I lay in bed, I realized that my recklessness was what was going to lead me to my death.

From that moment on, I changed my ways. I stopped seeking out danger and started living a more measured, cautious life. And, in the end, it was the right decision.

I lived to see all of my sons grow up and start families of their own. And, despite that moment of reckoning, I never forgot the joy of having a large family.
