In a digital future, books have been banned. Paper is the opiate of the intellectual. A small time, illegal bibliodealer just found a book that could set him up for life. Unfortunately, he has developed a taste for his own product.
In a future where all books were banned, Eric had a unique job. He was an illegal bibliodealer, sneaking books into the hands of those who crave knowledge. It was a risky job, but it paid well and he felt good knowing that he was helping people.

One day, he stumbled upon a rare book that could set him up for life. It was a first edition of To Kill a Mockingbird, and he knew it was worth a fortune. But instead of selling it, he couldn't resist the temptation to read it.

He was hooked. He read every night until dawn, unable to put the book down. Slowly, Eric started to lose control. He started hoarding books, reading them all, one after another. He lost track of time, and before he knew it, he was drowning in a sea of paper.

He knew he had a problem, but he couldn't stop himself. In the end, he was caught by the authorities, his hoard of books discovered. He was sentenced to life in prison, but he didn't care. He had found solace in the pages of his beloved books.
