Ever since I was a little boy, I’ve always been different. I didn’t know what it was back then, but as I grew older, I started realizing I had a super power. It wasn’t the kind of super power you would see in movies or comic books. Instead, it was something that I never thought I’d feel fear for.

I can create fire with just a thought.

For many people, being able to summon flames might seem like the coolest thing ever. And honestly, it is. But for me, it’s not all that it’s cracked up to be. I’ve never been able to control when or where my powers would show up, and that’s made it something akin to a horror for me. It’s caused me nothing but stress, anxiety and fear since I discovered it.

I was only six years old when I first realized I had these powers. I was sitting in my room, playing with my toys and feeling out of place when a spark leapt from my fingers, and I saw a small flame light up on the corner of my bed. I was absolutely terrified. I had no idea what was happening, and the fear that came along corroded my young mind.

I grew up trying to control my powers, trying to suppress them as much as possible. Whenever I’d get too excited or overwhelmed, they’d appear — no matter how hard I tried to fight them off. My family noticed, but they never talked about it, or at least not in front of me. It was an unspoken truth that none of us spoke about, and it only made me feel more alone in the world.

It wasn’t until much later that I finally decided to seek someone to help me reign in my abilities.

When I met him, the flames were already burning along my arms, and I was on the edge of hysteria. But talking to him was like something out of a fantasy novel; he was patient, understanding, and kind. He listened to me patiently when I talked, offered me advice and guidance. And little by little, I started learning how to use my power without fear.

At first, it was slow going. It took me a long time to learn how to control the flames. I’d have to concentrate on them consciously, directing their movements rather than letting my excitement or fear guide them. But the more I trained, the more I found that I was getting better, and actually starting to enjoy myself again.

It wasn’t long before I was able to create all sorts of things with my power. Flames that caressed the world around me, forming beautiful, intricate designs. And it wasn’t just for beauty, either. I’ve long found that my fire powers have helped me out in a variety of ways, from lighting up dark areas to scaring off unwanted intruders. I’ve even used my powers to create a firewall that stopped the spread of flames once, and that experience made me realize just how much of an asset my abilities could be in the right hands.

Nowadays, I’m much happier than I used to be. The fear that once controlled me has been replaced with pride, and in many ways, I owe my life to the man who helped me understand myself. But that fear will always be a part of me, and I’ll always be afraid of losing control once again and hurting those I care about. However, that fear won’t stop me from enjoying my life the way I know it should be lived.

I’m not saying that I’m some kind of hero, or that my powers have somehow made me special. However, I’ve come to understand that what I do is unique, and I’m proud of who I am today. It wasn’t easy getting here, but nothing worth doing ever is.
