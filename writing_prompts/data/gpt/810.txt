I was sitting on the back porch of my grandparents' house, watching the sun set over the rolling hills of their farm. The air was cool and crisp, and I was wrapped in a cozy blanket as I sipped hot cocoa from a mug my grandma had made.

As I sat there, listening to the crickets chirp, I couldn't help but feel an overwhelming sense of happiness and contentment. This was where I had spent so many summers as a child, where I had first learned to ride a bike and had spent countless afternoons playing in the fields with my cousins.

Suddenly, I heard a rustling in the bushes behind me. I turned around to see a figure emerging from the darkness, shrouded in a hooded cloak. My heart pounding, I called out to my grandparents for help, but they didn't answer.

The figure drew closer, and I realized with horror that it was my own mother. But something was different about her - her eyes were hollow and lifeless, and her skin was ashen and gray. She lunged at me, her hands contorting into claws.

I scrambled to my feet and ran inside, slamming the door behind me. But the figure was still there, pounding on the door with a strength that seemed impossible for my frail mother.

I backed away, searching frantically for a way out, but the windows were barred, and the door held firm. The pounding continued, and I could feel the wood of the door beginning to splinter under the relentless assault.

Just as I thought I couldn't take it anymore, the pounding suddenly stopped. I cautiously approached the door, peering through the peephole. In the darkness outside, I could just make out the shape of my mother's hooded cloak, hanging motionless.

Seconds later, the figure disappeared into thin air, leaving me alone in the silence of the house. But the memory of that night lingered with me for years afterwards, haunting me with the fear and helplessness I had felt in that moment of terror.
