Maggie was sitting on her couch, sipping tea and lost in her own world of books when she heard her doorbell ring. She wasn’t expecting anyone. She walked to the door and looked through the peephole to see a woman outside, looking nervous. She opened the door and greeted the stranger.

“Hello, can I help you?” Maggie asked.

The woman hesitated for a moment, before finally speaking, “I just want you to know that you are my favorite book character and I know how it ends and I want to help change it.”

Maggie’s eyebrows furrowed in confusion, “What are you talking about? I’m not a book character.”

“You don’t understand,” the woman said, “I’m from an alternate universe. In my world, you are the main character in a book, and it’s a tragedy. But I can help change it.”

Maggie was intrigued but skeptical. She had always been a big reader, often losing herself in different worlds and characters, but she had never believed in alternate universes or anything like that. However, the woman appeared sincere, and Maggie thought maybe she was just a strange neighbor she had never met before.

“Come inside,” Maggie said, gesturing for her to enter. The woman stepped inside, and Maggie led her to the living room.

“What do you mean by you know how it ends?” Maggie asked.

“In the book, you die in a car accident while on your way to have dinner with your best friend,” the woman said. “But I have a way to stop it from happening.”

Maggie couldn’t believe what she was hearing. It was all just too crazy. She wondered if this woman was some kind of a con artist, but she decided to hear her out.

“How are you going to stop it from happening?” Maggie asked.

“My universe is connected to yours through the power of books,” the woman explained. “The story that was meant to be written about you doesn’t have to happen if we can find a way to change it. I can help you avoid this accident and change the ending.”

Maggie shook her head in disbelief. What was happening was so surreal that it felt like she was living in a book herself. She felt a spark of hope rise in her. She had been through a lot of difficulties in her life, and she couldn’t help but wonder what kind of book her life was. She had never thought about the end of her story before.

“Okay, let’s say that I believe you,” Maggie said after a moment. “What do we need to do?”

“I need to show you things,” the woman said. “I need you to see the possibilities.”

The woman then reached into her bag and pulled out a book. It was a book that Maggie had given up to try and finish, as the ending was too sad.

The woman handed the book to Maggie. Maggie took it and flipped through the pages, reading here and there. She noticed that some of the pages were different from how she remembered them.

“The pages have been changing since I entered your universe,” The woman said. “That means there is hope. We can still change the story.”

Maggie realized that the woman wasn’t just a crazy person. She had somehow entered a parallel universe through a book, and she had a mission that involved her.

Maggie wondered if this could be real. The more she thought about it, the more plausible it seemed. After all, the book in her hands kept changing. Maybe, just maybe, this woman was right.

“Alright. What’s the plan?” Maggie asked.

They spent the whole night going through the book and discussing possible outcomes. They made a list of different ways in which they could change the outcome of the accident. Finally, they had a plan set.

The next day, Maggie went to visit her best friend, who lived on the other side of town. This was the same best friend who Maggie regularly had dinner with, but always ended up cancelling last minute. Maggie had always felt bad about letting her friend down, but the universe always had a way of getting in the way.

Returning home from the visit, Maggie saw that the traffic light at the intersection she always drove through was out. It made her take an alternative route. She drove through the less familiar streets, and she saw an eye-catching restaurant that she’d never seen before.

A whim took hold of her, and she pulled over and decided to check it out. Inside, she ran into a familiar face - the woman from the alternate universe. Maggie was shocked, and the woman explained the situation. They sat and talked, and Maggie realized that the woman was in love with the book character that she was supposed to be. But, she didn’t want her favorite character to die.

“Why were you so concerned with me if you are in love with the book character?” Maggie asked.

“Because,” the woman said, looking at Maggie with a tender expression. “When I look at you, I see hope. You, like all of us, are flawed, but you also have the power to change your life. And maybe, just maybe, if you can change your story, I can change mine too.”

Maggie saw the woman’s point of view and nodded in agreement. She decided that she would continue to move forward with the idea of changing her story. She hoped that by changing her story, she would be able to change the lives of others in her alternate universe too.

As the days went by, Maggie felt hopeful. She felt as if she had the power to change her story, and she was determined to make that happen. She didn’t know what the future holds, but she continued to believe that she has the ability to write her own story.
