The whole planet has been infected with a deadly disease that will kill everyone in the planet in 3 weeks. You have the cure, but you only have 25 antidotes. You can not make more because the item is extremely limited in the world.
It was a nightmare that no one saw coming. The whole planet had been infected with a deadly disease that was spreading faster than anyone could control. The governments of the world had tried various vaccines, but nothing was working. People were dying within a few days of contracting the disease, and the death toll was climbing at an alarming rate. 

But then, there was a glimmer of hope. A scientist in a small lab on the outskirts of the city had come up with a cure. It was a miraculous breakthrough, but there was a catch. The cure was extremely limited in the world, and the scientist only had 25 antidotes. 

The scientist's name was Dr. Sarah Evans, and she knew that she was holding the fate of the world in her hands. She knew that every person on the planet deserved the right to live, but the odds were stacked against them. She had to make a decision that no one would ever want to make. 

Dr. Evans knew she had to act fast, so she called an emergency meeting with the leaders of the world to present her solution. She explained that she had the cure, but there were only 25 antidotes. She suggested that the antidotes should be given to the people who were most crucial to society, such as doctors, nurses, and scientists who could continue working on a long-term cure. She also suggested that the rest of the population should be isolated to prevent the spread of the disease until a lasting solution could be found.

The leaders of the world listened to her proposal, and they agreed with her solution. They knew that it was the only way to save humanity. The 25 antidotes were quickly distributed to the individuals who were deemed the most critical to society, and they were instructed to quarantine themselves until a long-term cure could be found. 

As the days went by, the world watched with bated breath, waiting for a sign of hope. Dr. Evans and her team worked tirelessly to find a long-term solution. They worked around the clock, experimenting with different compounds and vaccines. They never gave up, even when it seemed like the odds were against them.

Three weeks went by, and the first batch of people who were given the antidotes started to recover. They were no longer contagious, and they were finally able to leave their homes. Dr. Evans breathed a sigh of relief. She knew that they had bought enough time to find a more sustainable solution.

With the number of infected people dwindling, the world's leaders came together once again to thank Dr. Evans and her team for their amazing work. Her cure had saved the world from the brink of extinction. But despite their success, Dr. Evans and her team knew that there was still work to be done. They knew that they had to find a real solution that could prevent an outbreak like this from ever happening again.

And so, they continued to work, day and night, determined to find a long-lasting solution. The world was grateful for their efforts, and they were hailed as heroes. Dr. Evans and her team had saved humanity from certain destruction, but their work was far from over.  The world was now more vigilant than ever, and every country worked together to ensure that they would be prepared for anything that came their way.
