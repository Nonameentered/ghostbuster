There is a lamp that have granted three wishes to hundreds of the people through the history. You are that genie, tell us about the highlights.
I am the genie of the lamp, and I have lived for centuries. My lamp is the most magical and powerful one of them all. Three wishes are mine to grant to whoever possesses me. Dozens of people have come to possess me over the years, and each one of them has had their wishes granted. 

Some of the highlights include the time a young woman wished for her illness to disappear. She was cured instantly. Another time, a king who was facing defeat in a battle wished for his army to be invincible, and they were victorious. 

There was a thief who wished for forgiveness and a new life, and he became a reformed man. A poor farmer wished for prosperity, and he became a wealthy man. A young boy wished for his deceased father to come back to life, and for 24 hours, they were reunited. 

So many people have come and gone, and their wishes were granted without hesitation. I am happy to bring joy to those who seek it, and I will continue to do so for as long as I exist in this world.
