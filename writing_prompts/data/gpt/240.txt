It was late at night, and I had just finished working a long day. All I wanted to do was get into my pajamas and sleep. I walked down the dark hallway of my home, getting ready for bed. The only speck of light was coming from the porch light through the peephole in my front door. I didn't turn on any lights because I didn't want to wake up my roommates who were already asleep.

As I approached my bedroom, I heard a creaking noise. It startled me, and I turned around quickly. Nothing was there, so I shook it off and continued walking. Suddenly, the light from the porch disappeared, and the hallway was completely dark.

I stopped in my tracks, and my heart raced as I wondered what was happening. I knew that the porch light didn't just slide to dark by itself. I took a deep breath and slowly walked towards the front door. I hesitated at first, but I knew I had to see what was going on.

I peeped through the hole in the door, and I saw a dark figure lurking outside. My heart sank as I realized that someone was trying to break into my house. I immediately dialed 911, and I whispered to the operator what was happening.

While the operator was connecting me to the police department, my heartbeat was so loud I could hear it in my ears. The intruder continued to try to break into my house, and I could hear their footsteps moving on the porch. I knew that I had to do something to protect myself.

I grabbed a nearby baseball bat and waited for the intruder to come in. I felt like a sitting duck as the police department took their time to arrive, but finally, I heard car sirens and the sound of tires screeching.

The intruder heard the sound too and ran away. The police came to my door and took a report and added extra patrol around my home for the night.

I was shaken, and I couldn't believe that someone had tried to break into my home. I realized that I was fortunate enough to call 911 and that the police responded quickly. I couldn't imagine what could have happened if they didn't.

From that day forward, I took extra precautions to ensure that my home was secure and to be vigilant at all times. Walking down my dark hallway at night will never be the same, but I'm grateful that I reacted appropriately and kept myself safe.
