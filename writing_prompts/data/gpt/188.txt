It had been six months since I first discovered my ability to teleport. It was terrifying at first, but after three long months of practice, I had finally managed to gain control of it. It was my secret, and I had no intention of telling anyone about it. However, over the past week, my life took a turn for the worse.

There was this man, maybe in his late thirties, who had been following me to work for the past week. Every morning when I stepped out of my door, there he was lurking beneath the streetlamp, his eyes fixed on me. My gut instinct told me that he meant trouble, but I couldn't help but shake the feeling that I was overreacting.

One bright morning, as I was walking to work, I noticed he was much closer to me than usual. I quickly turned around, and sure enough, he was coming up fast behind me. I could feel my heart pounding inside my chest as I took a deep breath and concentrated on my power.

Within seconds, I found myself transported three blocks away from my office. I was safe, but I felt a cold sweat drip down my back as I realized that the man had been following me for a reason. I had to figure out why he was tailing me before it was too late.

My mind raced with possibilities. Maybe he knew about my power? Or maybe he was sent by someone who did. But who could it be? I couldn't help but feel paranoid and alone with my secret.

From that day on, I kept an eye out for him and employed all the skills I had learned from teleportation to avoid him. But still, the thought of being exposed to the world as something other than a mere mortal was daunting. I knew then that if I wanted to protect that secret and myself, I needed to learn more about who or what was behind the man who followed me.
