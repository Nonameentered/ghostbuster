Humans start out at birth with milk-white blood. The more bad deeds they commit, the darker their blood becomes. One day, you meet your soulmate. Skip a few years, and things are amazing… Until your soulmate trips, falls, and the cut they get drips ink-black blood…
From the moment I was born, I knew that everything I did would affect the color of my blood. My parents told me that all humans start out with milk-white blood, but that the more bad deeds they commit, the darker their blood becomes. As a child, I was always careful not to do anything that would darken my blood.

I grew up in a small town, surrounded by people who shared my beliefs. It wasn't until I went away to college that I came face to face with the darker side of humanity. I saw people lying, cheating, stealing, and worse. And I could see the evidence of their deeds in the color of their blood. I was shocked by how dark some people's blood was.

Despite the ugliness I saw in the world, I never lost hope that I would find someone who shared my values. And then, one day, I met my soulmate. It was at a coffee shop, where we both reached for the same muffin at the same time. Our eyes met, and we both laughed. It was instant chemistry.

We spent the next few hours talking and laughing, and by the end of the day, I knew that I had found the person I had been searching for. Over the next few years, we fell deeply in love. We spent every moment we could together, exploring the world and making plans for the future.

I was thrilled to discover that my soulmate shared my values. Together, we became activists, fighting for justice and equality. Our love for each other grew stronger with every good deed we did together. And never once did either of us commit a deed that would darken our blood.

But then, one day, everything changed. We were taking a walk in the park when my soulmate tripped and fell. I rushed to help them up, but when I saw the cut on their hand, my heart sank. The blood that dripped from the wound was ink-black.

I knew what this meant. My soulmate had done something terrible. Had they lied to me? Cheated on me? Hurt someone else? I couldn't believe it. I didn't want to believe it.

But as my soulmate looked up at me with tears in their eyes, I knew that my worst fears were true. They had committed a terrible deed, and now their blood was blackened forever. I felt as if someone had taken a sledgehammer to my heart.

For weeks, I didn't speak to my soulmate. I couldn't bear to look at them. They had stained the purity of our love, and I didn't know how to forgive them.

But slowly, as the weeks turned into months, I began to see my soulmate in a new light. I realized that their one misdeed didn't define them as a person. They were still the kind, loving, generous person that I had fallen in love with all those years ago. And I knew that I still loved them, with all of my heart.

So we worked through it. We talked, we cried, we apologized. And in the end, we emerged stronger than ever. Our love had been tested, and it had come out the other side shining brighter than before.

I no longer thought of my soulmate's ink-black blood as a stain on our love. Instead, I saw it as a reminder that we are all only human, that we all make mistakes. And that no matter what color our blood may be, love can conquer all.
