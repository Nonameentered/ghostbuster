Describe your descent into Hell
I never imagined that my life would take me to an abyss as dark and unforgiving as Hell itself. It all started with a simple mistake; a single decision that seemed harmless at first. I thought that I could handle the stress by just trying out a drug for a change. But soon enough, it formed an iron grip around my mind and wouldn't let go, creating a spiralling descent into the abyss. My addiction got worse, leaving me with no care about anything else except getting my next fix.

Before I knew it, my life became a living nightmare of shame, loneliness, and despair. Every chosen step deeper into addiction drew me closer to the putrid and morbid reality of Hell. I lost my job, my relationships, and all of my friends, and I was trapped in a black hole with no way out.

It wasn't until my family intervened that I finally found my way out of this living hell. With their support, I found a rehab centre where I received the help I needed to finally break free of my addiction. Though the road to recovery was fraught with difficulty, I fought every step of the way and emerged victorious.

My descent into the abyss had been a painful and frightful experience, but it was one that taught me a valuable lesson about the importance of fighting for your own freedom. Hell may exist, but it doesn't have to consume me.
