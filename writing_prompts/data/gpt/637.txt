Everyone in America gets dosed at the same time.
One day, a mysterious gas seeped into every corner of America. Simultaneously, every person in the nation inhaled the gas and waited for something to happen. At first, nothing seemed to change, but as the day went on, people began to notice subtle differences in their behavior. 

Some people grew kinder and more empathetic, while others became more irritable. Some experienced heightened creativity, while others were plagued with anxiety. But no matter the changes, everyone knew they were not alone. 

From coast to coast, people gathered in the streets to ask each other how they were feeling. They shared stories, laughed, and cried together, bound by this strange and sudden connection. Many vowed to use their newfound empathy to create a better world, while others saw the potential danger in everyone being influenced in the same way. 

The gas eventually dissipated, leaving behind a nation forever changed. Some feared what might have come had the gas stayed longer, while others saw it as a wake-up call to love and understand one another.
