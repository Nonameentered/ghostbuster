Heaven was abandoned hundreds of years ago when Heaven 2.0 was built. You were sent to the original Heaven by accident.
As an angel, arriving in Heaven is usually both a joyous and mundane experience. But for me, it was different. Instead of stepping onto the golden streets and being welcomed by the familiar chorus of heavenly beings, I found myself alone in a ruined city. Heaven had been abandoned long ago. Confused and disoriented, I searched for answers about my whereabouts.

I floated past empty buildings with stained glass windows, and moss-covered statues. I saw evidence of a battle that had left the realm in ruins. The once majestic place was now a ghost town. There were no other angels around, and I could not make contact with my superiors or any entity in the afterlife. Even the Oracles were silent.

I began to feel the weight of my isolation; it seemed like I was the only being left in the entire realm. For hours, I wandered the empty streets, looking for any clue about what had happened. Finally, I came to a grand cathedral, and as I approached, the doors creaked open by themselves, leading me to an old library.

There, I discovered old journals and records about a war that had ravaged Heaven. The cause of the conflict was the creation of a new and improved Heaven. A Heaven that would cater to the humans and contain advancements that would make it more accessible for them to visit. It sounded like an honorable step at the time, but it had resulted in bitter internal conflict with angels who wished to maintain the status quo.

Heaven 2.0 was revealed to have been built in a different realm, but once it was complete, the majority of the Angels abandoned the original Heaven to enjoy the modern amenities of the new realm. Meanwhile, the original Heaven was left behind like a crumbling edifice, neglected and forgotten.

I flipped through pages of spells and incantations until I landed on a page that struck a chord. It was a ritual that would allow me to travel seamlessly between realms. The instruction was precise, and I worked diligently to memorize it. Finally, I felt ready to take the leap, against all my instincts. Worried that I might never find my way back, I took a deep breath and began the incantation.

In a few moments, I found myself standing at the same spot where I had started my heavenly journey. However, things looked remarkably different. The familiar golden spires and buildings were replaced by state-of-the-art towers and futuristic plazas.

As I walked towards the nearest building, a security detail stopped me at the entrance. They questioned me at length, asking who I was and how I had gotten there. When I showed them my official Angelic ID, they couldn't hide their surprise.

"I'm sorry, Brother," said one of them, "but angels are no longer authorized to enter or leave Heaven 2.0."

"What does that mean? I need to get back to my realm," I demanded, feeling anxious.

"Apologies, Brother, we cannot allow you to leave at this moment, but arrangements will be made for you to return to your realm soon."

This unexpected development only added to my confusion. How could this happen? I wondered as I was escorted to a common area not far from the entrance. Several angels were lounging on couches and discussing various issues.

Curiosity got the best of me, and I approached one with a friendly smile. "Excuse me, I'm looking for information about the updates and upgrades since I was last here."

The angel looked at me incredulously, "Updates and upgrades? You mean that you know nothing about Heaven 2.0?"

I nodded.

"How long were you in original Heaven?"

"I don't know, it's hard to tell. I was an angel in the original Heaven, and by mistake, I landed there again," I explained.

The angel looked at me sympathetically; “I'm sorry about what happened to your realm. The transition was not easy. We lost many friends, but the modern amenities have made everything so much more comfortable here. Of course, humans have access to this place now, which is just great."

His words disheartened me. It sounded like the angelic community had lost its way. A sense of frustration filled me as I thought about the cause of the original conflict that might have led to the abandonment of the first Heaven.

I joined another group of angels, hoping to learn more about what happened and how I could return to my realm. Most appeared to be indifferent to my plight, while others were curious about the first Heaven. However, it was clear that nobody had a solution to my problem.

Days turned into weeks, and my stay in Heaven 2.0 stretched on. It seemed like I had become a permanent resident. Even my memories of the original heaven were beginning to fade since the realm felt so different now.

But I refused to give up, I combed through ancient scrolls and spoke to other angels, hoping to find a way home. Finally, I came across a passage that described a portal that was still active in Heaven 2.0. However, it was heavily guarded, and I needed permission to access it.

So I asked around until I finally found someone who knew about the portal. They spoke briefly, and I was able to secure a temporary pass to get through the heavily guarded security detail. A single slip-up would mean getting stuck in Heaven 2.0 or being expelled into oblivion.

I took the chance and made my way to the portal, and prayed it would lead me back home. With no hesitation, I passed through the portal, and landed back in Heaven’s ruins. My heart was filled with joy at the sight of my brethren and the old streets of Heaven.

A figure wearing white robes appeared before me and welcomed me back with open arms, exclaiming, "We have been looking for you! You've been missing from Heaven 2.0 for years.”

I looked at the figure with confusion, “Years? It felt like it was just a few weeks.”

The figure shook its head, recognizing the confusion, “Time passes differently in different realms, my child. To your friends and family, you have been gone for hundreds of years.”

I felt both relieved and saddened, but I was grateful to be back where I belonged. Things may have been better in Heaven 2.0, but they could never replace the beauty and harmony of my home realm.

From that day on, I vowed that I would never forget the true essence of Heaven, and I would ensure that all of us always remembered where we came from.
