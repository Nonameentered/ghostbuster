In the year 2020, humanity was nearly wiped out by an alien invasion. Earth's survivors were ordered to pay a tithe (one tenth of the worlds population) every decade to prevent enslavement. The year is now 2060, and you are among the chosen... and you refuse to go quietly.
It’s been 40 years since the alien invasion almost decimated humanity. The world I knew growing up no longer exists. The new world comes with a price, and that price is me. I am the tithe, the one chosen to be sent away. For the past year, I’ve been moving around, trying to stay off the radar, but the military easily found me.

They come for me in the middle of the night, but I am ready. I have been preparing for this moment, and I refuse to go quietly. I put up a fight, but ultimately I am overpowered and taken away.

The next day, I stand in a line with others who have been chosen. We are motionless, waiting for our fate. The anticipation builds as the sounds of footsteps approach. The door opens, and a man with cold eyes enters and begins to count us.

One by one, names are called out, and the chosen are taken away. I hear my name, and I know what happens next. I take a deep breath and step forward, but instead of willingly walking towards my fate, I give a firm push towards the man. He stumbles, and I take off running.

My heart races as my feet pound against the ground. I hear the sound of soldiers running behind me, but I am determined to escape. I run through the city, dodging obstacles and running faster than I ever have.

I can hear my pursuers getting closer, and the realization hits me that I can’t outrun them forever. The only thing left to do is fight. I turn around and face them, ready to take on anyone who stands in my way.

The fight is long, but my adrenaline keeps me going. I fight fiercely, and eventually, I emerge victorious. I realize I’m not alone, and I’m part of a group that has been fighting back all along. Together, we are stronger than the aliens thought, and we will continue to resist until we are truly free.
