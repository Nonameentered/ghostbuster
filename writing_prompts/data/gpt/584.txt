Write a generally lighthearted and cheerful story that is turned dark by its last few lines/last paragraph.
Jenna was always the life of the party. Her personality lit up every room she entered and her infectious laugh could make anyone smile. She had the gift of making people feel important and loved.

One day, Jenna decided to organize a surprise birthday party for her best friend, Sarah. She spent weeks planning the perfect party, inviting all of Sarah’s closest friends and family. On the day of the party, Sarah was overwhelmed with emotion and gratitude. She couldn’t believe how much effort Jenna had put in to make her birthday extra special.

As the night went on, everyone was having a great time, laughing and dancing the night away. Jenna was beaming with happiness, seeing her best friend have the time of her life. But as the clock struck midnight, Jenna silently slipped away from the party unnoticed.

The next day, Sarah received word that Jenna had taken her own life. No one knew why she did it, as she seemed to have everything going for her. Sarah was devastated, realizing that her best friend had been struggling in silence.

The once cheerful and lighthearted story had turned dark, leaving Sarah to wonder what more she could have done to prevent such a tragedy.
