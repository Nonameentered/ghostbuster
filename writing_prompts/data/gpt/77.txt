Every 2000 years a Lottery is drawn in the Universe. Earth has been drawn three times in a row.
For as long as anyone could remember, the universe had held a special lottery every 2000 years. The prize was unknown, but the excitement it generated was intense. The universe would tune into the live broadcast, tens of billions of beings all eager to see the winning planet. The odds of any single planet being drawn were virtually impossible, but it still captured the imagination of every sentient being for as long as time had been recorded.

But then something strange happened. For the first time in history, the same planet was drawn three times in a row. Earth. Like every other time, no one knew what would happen once a planet was drawn - there had never been any kind of precedent. But as soon as the third draw was announced, the universe held its breath. What could this mean?

As the broadcast flickered to life, the inhabitants on Earth were totally unaware of the cosmic attention they were receiving. But as soon as the world leaders were alerted, all activity across the planet ground to a halt.

The first announcement came a week after the draw. All across the planet, there was a strange feeling in the air. It was electric, almost tangible. Then a message was received - an object was headed towards Earth, travelling at a speed not previously thought possible. When it arrived, Earth was engulfed in a brilliant light that lasted for an entire day.

The second announcement came shortly afterward. Every disease that had ever plagued the planet was suddenly cured, as if a switch had been flipped. It was a miracle, something that the people of Earth couldn't believe. They had never imagined that the universe even knew about them, let alone that there was a prize associated with being drawn in the lottery.

The third announcement was made a millennia later. The descendants of those who had witnessed the previous events were waiting with bated breath for another miracle to happen. But this was different - the message was a warning. The universe was aware of Earth's existence, and it was watching. The message contained a list of rules and instructions on how to live in a way that would ensure the planet's survival.

It was clear that the universe had plans for Earth, ones that would involve the entire world. But what was in store? Only time would tell.
