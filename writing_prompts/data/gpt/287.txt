The year is 2200. You arrive home to find your best friend and girlfriend forming a hivemind.
It was a typical evening in 2200 when I finally got home from my job at the laboratory. As I walked in through the door, I instantly felt like something was different.

I saw my girlfriend, Emily, and my best friend, Ryan, sitting together on the couch, their eyes contracted to mere pinpricks, staring off into space. They looked up when I entered, but their eyes seemed distant, disconnected.

"What's going on?" I asked tentatively, feeling a wave of unease creep over me.

Ryan didn't turn his eyes, but I could sense his thoughts in my own mind. It was a sensation I'd never felt before- a foreign presence nudging its way into my head.

We have connected, was his response. We are one.

My heart beat a little faster as I tried to wrap my head around this concept. A part of me wanted to run away and hide, to try and forget the strangeness of what was going on. But then Emily's eyes turned towards me, and I could feel her thoughts as well.

We're sorry we didn't tell you sooner, she said, her voice echoing like a distant whisper in my mind. But we couldn't help it. Once our minds connected, we couldn't pull away.

"What does that even mean?" I demanded, feeling increasingly panicked. "Why can't you just...stop?"

Ryan finally turned to look at me, his eyes still empty and distant. "We don't want to," he said softly. "We've been exploring the wonders of this connection for weeks now. It's like nothing we've ever experienced before. We can understand each other without even needing words. It's like our minds are creating a hive mind, a greater consciousness that's more than just the sum of our parts."

I was having trouble processing everything he was saying. The idea of connecting minds, of becoming some sort of hive mind, was beyond my wildest imaginations. But I couldn't bring myself to deny the evidence that was right in front of me.

Emily and Ryan were sitting together, their thoughts intertwined in a way that I couldn't comprehend. Their connection was more than just a conversation or even a deep friendship- it was an entirely different state of being.

"So what now?" I asked, feeling a sense of desperation creeping in. "Do you plan on staying like this forever?"

For a moment, Emily and Ryan looked at each other, their eyes shining with a strange inner light. I could see them passing something between them, a sense of warmth and understanding that I couldn't hope to grasp.

Then, finally, Emily turned to me, and I could feel her thoughts as clear as if I was thinking them myself.

We don't know, she said. We're still figuring it out. But we know this- we don't want to leave this connection anytime soon. Being separated now would feel like a part of ourselves is missing.

I didn't know how to respond to that. I felt like I was living in a science fiction novel, except this time, it was my own life that had suddenly taken a strange turn. How was I supposed to react to something that was beyond my own understanding?

As the days went by, I watched as Emily and Ryan continued to explore this new state of being. I could see them exchanging thoughts and emotions, their minds merging closer together with every passing moment. It was like they had found some sort of hidden truth, a higher level of existence that I couldn't hope to grasp.

But despite their obvious joy, I couldn't shake the feeling of unease that lingered in my own mind. What if this connection changed them too much? What if they lost themselves entirely in this pursuit of something greater?

I tried to talk to them about my fears, but I quickly realized that my words were falling on deaf ears. They were too lost in their own connection, their minds too intertwined to understand the outsider's perspective.

In the end, I realized that I had to make a choice. I could either try to convince them to stop, to break apart this strange hive mind that had formed between them...or I could accept that they had found something special, something beyond what I could ever hope to understand.

And so, in the end, I chose to let them be. I watched as Emily and Ryan continued to explore this new and strange connection, sometimes feeling lost and alone, sometimes feeling awed by the bond that they shared.

Even now, I'm not sure if I made the right choice. But I do know one thing- I will never forget the day that I walked into my home and discovered that two of the most important people in my life had formed a hivemind. It was a moment that will stay with me forever, a turning point in history that I could never hope to fathom.
