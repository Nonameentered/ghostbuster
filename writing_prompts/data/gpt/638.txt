As soon as the man opened the door to the personal library, he noticed the shelves were filled with thousands of copies of a book titled "How to make sure no one is reading your mind". The sheer mass of the book was overwhelming, each stack of them reaching up towards the ceiling.

It was strange that there were no other books on the shelves. No history books, no novels, no biographies, just this one book repeated over and over again. The man walked towards the pile and picked up one copy. It was written by a man named William Strong and had a copyright date from the early 21st century.

He flipped through the pages, and all of the chapters were dedicated to different methods of preventing people from reading your thoughts. There were various military techniques, some meditation practices, and even physical exercises.

The man stood there for a moment in contemplation, wondering who could have amassed such a collection of identical books. He felt a pang of curiosity and strange dread gnawing at him, and he felt compelled to learn more about the book and the library.

As he walked along the shelves, the books became more organized, moving from techniques to real-world uses. He found one chapter titled "For Spies" and another titled "Self-Defense," which intrigued him. He took stacks of them over to the reading table and pored over the texts, losing himself in trying to learn as much as possible.

The day turned into night as the man lost himself in the pages. He was so engrossed he did not realize that someone else had entered the library. He looked up and saw a woman walking in, wearing a dark dress and her hair was tied up high in a bun. She looked at him with interest but did not say anything. She took a seat across from him, and they both went back to reading.

Hours turned into days, they became so lost in the books, they didn't leave, and they scoured the pages and absorbed the knowledge. The man learned about the author, who he was and how he managed to write such an extensive book on this topic. William Strong was a man who was plagued with constant hallucinations of other people's thoughts. He had spent his entire life trying to find a way to silence it.

The woman found a few mentions of a person who was also trying to do the same thing as William Strong. They crossed out all instances of this person's name, making it impossible to discern who they were.

Without any other knowledge, they decided to continue studying, as the thought of knowing who crossed that name out bugged them to no end.

Days passed, and the two never left the library, choosing instead to sleep in the reading chairs. They became increasingly concerned with the topic of the book. As time went on, the man was convinced that he was constantly surrounded by people who were trying to read his mind. The woman, meanwhile, believed that people could control others' thoughts if they had the skills.

Eventually, the man fell into a complete meltdown, turning on the woman and accusing her of being a plant sent to spy on him. The woman tried to help, but the man kept spiraling further and further down the rabbit hole, spending years in the library studying the book.

Eventually, the man passed away, and the woman inherited the library. She didn't know what to do with it but kept it nonetheless. Over the years, she met many people who were similar to the man in one way or another, and she always offered the library to them, watching as they, too, became lost in the endless pursuit of knowledge of William Strong's book.
