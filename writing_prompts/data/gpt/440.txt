In the future readers are'in' the story, and what they say affects the outcome. One reader is unsatisfied with the ending of a particular story.
In the year 2050, the world had completely transformed. Technology had advanced to the point where readers could become part of the story. They could enter into the world of the characters and their actions could change the outcome of the story. This new literary era was wildly popular, but it had its challenges.

One day, a young woman named Lily decided to enter into the world of her favorite book. She was excited to see the story unfold before her eyes and to be an active participant. However, as the story progressed, she became increasingly dissatisfied with the ending. She felt that the author had not given the characters a proper conclusion. They had been left in a state of ambiguity and uncertainty.

Lily decided to take matters into her own hands. She began to make comments and suggestions that would guide the story towards the outcome that she wanted. She interacted with the characters and helped them to make decisions that would lead them towards a happier ending. She felt exhilarated as she watched the story shift and change based on her input.

But as the story drew to a close, Lily realized that she had become too invested. She had manipulated the story, taking it away from the author's original vision. She felt guilty and ashamed. She knew that she had to leave the story world and allow it to conclude in its own natural way.

As Lily stepped back into the real world, she wondered how many other readers had allowed their desires to control the outcome of the story. She hoped that her experience would serve as a reminder that every story had its own unique path, and sometimes it was best to simply let it unfold as it may.
