As a genie, I am bound to grant the wishes of those who summon me, no matter how frivolous or outlandish they may seem. However, I cannot deny the guilt that settles in my chest when I remember the last wish I granted.

The man who summoned me was desperate. He pleaded with me to grant him wealth beyond his wildest dreams. Wanting to please him, I granted his wish without hesitation.

But as soon as the wish was granted, I felt a sense of unease. The man's wealth came at the cost of others. He acquired his riches through corrupt means, stepping on anyone who got in his way. Countless innocent people suffered because of his greed.

I couldn't shake the feeling of guilt that gnawed at me. I knew I had to do something to make it right.

So I appeared to the man once again, this time in my human form. He was surprised to see me standing in front of him, but I wasted no time in explaining why I had returned.

"Your wish was granted, but at a cost that was too high," I said, staring into his eyes. "The wealth you have acquired has caused pain and suffering for others. That is not the way it was meant to be."

The man's expression softened. "I never meant for anyone to get hurt," he said.

"I know," I replied, "but your actions have consequences. And it is my duty to ensure that justice is served."

I waved my hand, and suddenly the man was transported to a courtroom, where he was tried and found guilty of his crimes. He spent the rest of his life repenting for his past actions, using his wealth to right the wrongs he had committed.

As I watched the man make amends for his wrongdoings, I felt the weight of guilt finally lift from my shoulders. I knew I had made the right decision in intervening, and that my actions had helped to bring about a little bit of justice in an unjust world.
