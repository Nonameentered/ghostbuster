After you leave here, remember that you must never look back.
Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Lily who lived in a small village surrounded by dense forests. She longed to explore the world beyond the trees, but her family forbade her from leaving the village. One day, while wandering in the forest, Lily met a wise old woman who gave her a precious locket and a curious warning: "After you leave here, remember that the locket is your guide, and you must never look back."

The following day, Lily snuck out of her house with the locket in her hand and ventured deep into the woods. She walked and walked until she reached the other side of the forest, where she discovered a lush meadow with a beautiful castle in the distance. Without hesitation, Lily walked towards the castle, feeling free and exhilarated.

However, as she approached the castle gates, she heard a voice whispering, "Lily, don't enter. Look back and go home." She hesitated for a moment, but the memory of the wise old woman's warning echoed in her mind, and she didn't dare to look back. She hurried inside the castle, where she found herself in a grand ballroom filled with people dancing and laughing. Everyone welcomed her with open arms, and Lily spent hours enjoying the festivities.

But as the night drew to a close, Lily knew that she had to leave. She bid farewell to her new friends and turned around to exit the castle. As she walked away, she heard the voice again, "Lily, look back." This time, curiosity got the better of her, and she turned around. 

To her horror, the castle vanished in a puff of smoke, and she was standing alone in the middle of a dark, empty field. The locket in her hand glowed dimly, guiding her back towards the forest. As she walked, she realized that the wise old woman's warning had saved her from a terrible fate. She swore never to stray from her path again and to never look back.
