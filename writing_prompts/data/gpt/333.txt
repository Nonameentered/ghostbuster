No one mourns the deaths of monsters
Once upon a time, a small village nestled in the heart of a dense forest. The villagers had always lived in peace and harmony, but one day, something changed.

One night, a terrifying monster entered the village and began causing havoc. Its eyes glowed like fire, and its sharp teeth glinted in the moonlight. The villagers ran for cover, fearful of their lives. But when the monster didn't leave, they knew they had to do something.

The bravest warriors in the village banded together and took up arms to fight the monster. They attacked it with all their might, but it was too powerful. One by one, the warriors fell to the monster's fierce claws, until finally, the monster was slain.

The villagers were overjoyed that their town had been saved, but they soon realized that no one mourned the death of the monster.

In fact, most of them were happy it was gone. Even the bravest warrior who had defeated the monster felt no regret at its demise. It was just another beast that had threatened their way of life, and they had defeated it. No one stopped to think about the creature's soul or what kind of life it may have had before ending up in their village.

Months went by, and the village went back to its peaceful ways. The memory of the monster's attack soon faded, and the villagers became complacent once again.

But one day, just as suddenly as before, another monster appeared in the village. This one was even more fearsome than the last. It had wings and could breathe fire. The villagers were once again in great peril.

This time, the warriors were ready. They fought with great bravery, but the monster was too powerful. It took many lives before it too was finally defeated. Once again, the villagers felt no remorse at the monster's death.

This pattern repeated itself several times over the years, with different monsters appearing and being defeated by the warriors. Each time a creature was slain, the villagers celebrated, but no one ever stopped to consider the impact of their actions.

The warriors became heroes, and songs were sung about their bravery and strength, but in their eyes, they were simply doing what was necessary to protect their village.

Years passed and the village grew prosperous, but the memory of the monsters never faded. Children were told the stories of the heroic warriors who had slain the beasts, and excitement grew as more and more creatures were defeated.

But one day, an old man appeared in the village. He was dressed in rags and had a long beard, but something about him was different. He didn't seem afraid of the villagers, and instead, he greeted them warmly.

The villagers were curious. "Who are you and what do you want?" they asked.

The old man smiled and replied, "I'm a traveler, and I've come to learn about your village."

The villagers were suspicious, but they allowed the old man to stay. Over the next few days, the old man quietly observed the village and its many customs. He spoke to the villagers and learned their stories.

One day, the old man approached the bravest warrior. "Tell me, why do you fight these monsters so fiercely?"

The warrior looked at the old man and replied, "These creatures are a threat to our village. They hurt and kill our people. We must defend ourselves and our way of life."

The old man nodded thoughtfully. "But have you ever thought about why the monsters are attacking your village? What if they're simply looking for a home of their own?"

The bravest warrior stared at the old man, confused. He had never thought about the monsters' motives before. He had only ever seen them as threats, not as living creatures with feelings and needs of their own.

Over the next few days, the old man spoke to more and more villagers, asking them to consider the lives of the monsters they had slain. Slowly, a new perspective began to take hold in the village.

The villagers realized that the monsters weren't just mindless beasts. They had families and homes just like them. They had lives that were just as important as the villagers' own.

And so, the villagers began to mourn the deaths of the monsters. They held a ceremony to honor them and even built a shrine in their memory.

The bravest warrior realized that they had been wrong to think of the monsters as nothing more than monsters. They were living creatures that deserved respect and compassion.

From then on, the village changed. They began to seek out peaceful solutions to their problems instead of resorting to violence. Their once-fierce warriors became emissaries of peace and understanding.

No one mourns the deaths of monsters, but in this village, they learned to do just that. They didn't forget the lessons the old man had taught them, and their village flourished in harmony with the once-feared creatures they had learned to respect.
