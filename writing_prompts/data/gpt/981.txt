Ever since the start of school, Olivia had been drowning in her homework. Every night, she would sit at her desk, staring at the pile of work in front of her, feeling overwhelmed and stressed. It wasn't long until Olivia decided she couldn't do it anymore. She needed help; she needed a demon. 

Olivia spent hours scouring the internet for a demon-summoning ritual. She found a spell that seemed easy, but the consequences weren't clear. She didn't care. She needed help desperately, and summoning a demon seemed like the only way. 

After reciting the incantation, a flash of light appeared, engulfing Olivia's room. The next thing she knew, a tall, imposing creature stood before her - a demon. It wasn't long before they made a deal. The demon would complete Olivia's homework, and in return, she would be his servant for life.

The first few days were easy for Olivia. All she had to do was sit back and watch as the demon worked tirelessly on her assignments. But then, things started to change. The demon grew tired of constantly doing Olivia's work and began demanding more from her. At first, it was small favors like fetching his meals or cleaning his lair, but soon, it became much more sinister. 

Olivia became trapped in a cycle of fear and servitude. She had foolishly thought that summoning a demon would solve all her problems, but it only made them worse. Every night she would lie awake, tormented by the monster she had unleashed. She knew she had to find a way out, but she didn't know how.

As the days went on, Olivia realized that she had made a terrible mistake. The demon was never going to let her go, and she would forever be a slave to his will. She wished she had never summoned him in the first place.

Olivia had learned an important lesson about shortcuts. There was no easy way out, and by summoning a demon, she had gotten herself into a situation she was unable to control. She knew she had to find a way to break the deal and get her life back before it was too late.
