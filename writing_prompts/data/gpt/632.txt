I am a photographer, it's what defines me, and it's what will shortly take away from me the beauty of this world. I've been diagnosed with a condition that will take away my eyesight within a year. It's been a slow and painful process to come to terms with this diagnosis, but I've managed somehow, to try and live each day as if it were my last.

Yesterday's consultation left me numb, and I'm still trying to absorb all the information that filled the sterile white space. I was told I have only three days left before the darkness takes over my world. Three final days to take in as much beauty as I can before it's all gone.

I packed my camera and a tripod, my best friend for the past few years, and made my way to the city park. The sun's setting rays splashed the sky with an array of fiery colors, and I was standing right in the middle of it, trying to capture every inch of the magnificent landscape before it disappears forever.

It was a bittersweet moment. The world around me was so beautiful, but I'm standing here at the brink of losing it all. I clicked and clicked, trying to capture everything I could see, trying to engrave the colors and shapes into my memory so that I'd have something to hold onto even after I lose my eyesight.

I'm in my apartment now with my camera resting on the table next to me. I can't see the photo's I've taken, but I don't need to. Every click holds a small piece of my memory, and it's comforting. The world is going dark in three short days, but I'll always have one last memory of all that beauty that surrounds us.
