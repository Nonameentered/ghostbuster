'When we were young, we could at least turn off our devices...'
When we were young, we could at least turn off our devices. I remember the days when we would go outside, ride our bikes, and make up our own games. We would stay outside until the sun went down or our parents called us in for dinner. We didn't have smart phones, tablets, or video games to distract us. Our imaginations were our entertainment.

As I look around now, I see children glued to their screens. They go to school with their devices, come home with their devices, and even take them to bed. They miss out on the beauty of exploring the world around them and creating their own adventures.

I once met a little girl who was completely engrossed in her iPad. She didn't even notice the world around her. I gently tapped her shoulder and asked her if she wanted to go outside and play. She looked up at me, bewildered, and said, "No thanks. I'm playing my game." That broke my heart. I realized that children today are addicted to technology and have become slaves to their screens.

I decided to do something about it. I started a program in our community called "Unplug and Play." It's a program where we encourage children to spend time away from their devices and participate in outdoor activities. We organize hikes, camping trips, scavenger hunts, and other fun events that promote outdoor play. The program has been a huge success, with more and more children joining every day.

Children need to understand that there is a life beyond their screens. They need to experience the joy of playing with their friends, feeling the sun on their faces, and exploring the world around them. Our program has given children the opportunity to do just that, and we hope to continue to inspire them to unplug and play.
