As soon as I read the message, my heart started to race. I knew that waking up just one minute past 5 AM was not a coincidence. It meant that I was one of the select few who were allowed to break the programming and stay awake during that crucial hour.

I quickly got ready and arrived at the military base just before 5:30 AM. For years, people had been warned about the dangers that lurked during that hour. There were things that the general population was not prepared to face, but the military believed that they could prepare a select few.

I had always been interested in the military as it offered a unique and unconventional lifestyle. However, I never thought that I would end up being one of the select few who would be trained to face whatever horrors lurked in the early morning hour.

Basic training was grueling, and I was pushed to my limits. However, I knew that this was what I had to do to protect my country and family. The hour between 5 and 6 AM was a time of great danger and only a few were brave enough to face it.

After months of intense training, I was deployed on a mission during the forbidden hour, and I finally realized why we were being trained so rigorously. The things that came out during that hour were not of this world, and unless you were prepared, you stood no chance.

Being one of the select few who could stay awake during that hour had given me a newfound appreciation for those who had to face the unknown and the dangers that lurked in the darkness. It was a different life, but it was worth it to keep our nation and its people safe.
