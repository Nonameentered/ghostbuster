Humans have just learned that the universe as we know it is just some alien kid's experiment for his science fair.
The news shook the human race to its core - the universe, with all of its complexity and beauty, was nothing more than a science fair experiment. The revelation flooded every news outlet and social media platform, and the world was awash with the questions of how this was even possible and why it took so long for us to figure it out. But as the initial shock subsided, people started to question the implications of this knowledge.

What if the alien kid got a poor grade, and the universe is just a failure in its alien teacher's eyes? What if it gets destroyed or worse, erased from existence? But what could mere humans do to influence an alien science fair project? The only thing left was to continue exploring, to discover every inch of the universe that was built by an alien with a shiny blue ribbon at their science fair.
