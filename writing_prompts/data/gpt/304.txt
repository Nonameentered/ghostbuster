Magic is real and it sure is deadly. This was the widely accepted fact in the world I was born into. The natural magic ability of an individual was determined by the number of people who died 24 hours prior to their birth. So, if you were born on a day when no natural disaster or tragic event occurred, then you were considered to be a weak magician.

My story began on a dark day when the world shook to its core. It was the day of the greatest massacre in human history. Exactly 24 hours before my birth, thousands of people were killed in a terror attack, which left the entire world in shock and grief. Little did anyone know, that the number of people who perished on that day was to determine the course of my life and that of two other children.

My parents were devastated by the events surrounding my birth. They feared for my life and wondered what kind of magic I would possess. In the midst of their worry, they received another shock. In the same hospital, two other mothers had given birth to children on the same day as me. One of the children was a boy while the other was a girl. They too were born exactly 24 hours after the massacre.

As we grew up, the world around us continued to mourn the loss of those who died during the massacre. But for us, it was a different story. We began to notice that we were different from other children. Our senses were sharper, we were faster, and we had a natural talent for magic that was beyond anything anyone had ever seen.

The boy who was born on the same day as me had a natural affinity for fire magic. Everywhere he went, he left a trail of flames in his wake. His magic was powerful and dangerous but he controlled it with ease. The girl, on the other hand, had a natural talent for water magic. She could summon water from thin air and shape it into any form she desired.

And then there was me. I possessed a talent for earth magic. I could sense the heartbeat of the earth and move the very ground beneath me. My magic was unlike anything anyone had ever seen before and it soon became clear that I possessed one of the strongest magical abilities in the world.

As we grew older, the three of us became known as the “Miracle Children.” People revered us for our magical abilities and feared us for our powers. We knew that we were different, but we never let that set us apart from each other. In a world where magic was real and deadly, we found solace in our shared history and unbreakable bond.

In the end, the massacre which brought us into the world became the very thing that set us apart from it. We used our magic to bring peace and comfort to those who had suffered. The world may never forget the tragedy that occurred on the day we were born, but we were proof that even in the darkest of times, miracles could still happen.
