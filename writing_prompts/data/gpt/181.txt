Why did you do it?

The question rang incessantly in my head, haunting my every thought. Why did I do it? I had always thought of myself as a good person, someone who never strayed from the path of righteousness. But then again, who was I to judge?

It had all started when I found out that my best friend had been sleeping with my girlfriend behind my back. I couldn't believe it at first, thinking that it was a sick joke that they were playing on me. But as the evidence piled up, it became harder and harder to deny. I had been betrayed by the two people I trusted the most in the world.

I confronted them both, hoping that there would be some kind of reasonable explanation for their actions. But they both just stared back at me blankly, like they didn't even care that they had hurt me. I was furious and hurt, unable to comprehend how people could be so callous.

And that's when I made the decision to do something that I would never be able to take back.

I went to a gun store and bought a pistol. It made me feel empowered, like I had control over the situation. I never thought of myself as a violent person, but the rage inside of me was too overwhelming to ignore. I wanted to hurt them like they had hurt me, to make them pay for the pain that they had caused. And I knew that there was only one way to do that.

I went to their house, intending to confront them both again. This time, I had the gun hidden in my jacket pocket. I didn't even know if I was going to use it, but the mere presence of the weapon made me feel more in control of the situation.

As I walked through their front door, I could feel my heart racing in my chest. I was scared, but I refused to show it. They were sitting on the couch, laughing about something like nothing was wrong. It was like they were making a mockery of everything that we had shared together.

I don't even remember what was said between us, but before I knew it, the gun was out of my pocket and pointing directly at them. They both jumped up, fear in their eyes. My girlfriend was crying, begging me to put the gun down. But my best friend just looked at me with this smug expression, like I was the one in the wrong.

I pulled the trigger.

The sound of the gunshot was deafening. It echoed through the house, bouncing off the walls like a pinball. I felt a sense of satisfaction flood over me, like I had achieved something significant. But then reality hit me like a freight train.

I had just killed my best friend.

My girlfriend was screaming, running towards his body, trying to revive him. But I knew that it was too late. I had taken a life, and I would never be able to take it back.

The police arrived soon after, and I surrendered myself without a fight. I knew that I had done something unforgivable, and I deserved to be punished. But even though I was surrounded by officers, handcuffs digging into my wrists, all I could hear was that voice in my head, asking me over and over again:

Why did you do it?

It's a question that I still can't answer. Even now, as I sit in my cell, with nothing but my thoughts to keep me company, I can't find a reason that justifies what I did. I know that I was hurt, and that I acted out of anger. But the consequences of my actions were so much greater than I could have ever imagined.

I lost my best friend. I lost the person who I thought was the love of my life. And worst of all, I lost a part of myself that I will never be able to regain. I will always be the person who killed someone, who took a life for no good reason.

Why did I do it? I wish I could answer with something profound or meaningful. But the truth is that I don't know. I was blinded by my emotions, and I made a mistake that I will never be able to take back. The only thing that I can hope for now is to find some kind of redemption, to do something that will make up for the terrible thing that I did. But I know that it will never be enough, that I will always be haunted by the memory of that fateful day, when everything changed forever.
