For years, scientists had been warning about the dangers of global warming. But it wasn't until recently that the public started taking it seriously. It turns out, the big oil companies had known about this problem since the 80s. In fact, they were secretly working to find a solution.

However, their solution wasn't what you'd expect. Instead of investing in clean technologies, they were hunting time travelers sent from the future to invent them. You see, the oil companies knew that the future depended on sustainable energy. If they could figure out what inventions would work, they could patent them and still control the market.

The hunt for time travelers began in the early 90s. The oil companies had a team of scientists and engineers who were tasked with finding anyone who seemed out of place. They monitored all major cities and made note of anyone who seemed to have advanced knowledge of technology.

It wasn't until 2004 that they finally found someone. A young man in his 20s appeared out of nowhere and started talking about advanced batteries and solar panels. The oil companies captured him and brought him to their secret lab.

The man's name was John and he was from the year 2090. He had been sent back in time to develop clean energy technology before it was too late. The oil companies were surprised to learn that their method had actually worked.

John was forced to work for the oil companies for years. They made him develop new technologies and then patented them as their own. John hated what he was doing, but he knew that his actions could benefit the future.

In 2018, John finally managed to escape. He stole some of the oil companies' plans and fled into hiding. A small group of environmentalists found him and helped him continue his work.

Together, they developed a system that was completely self-sustainable. They didn't patent their technology but instead shared it with the world for free. John knew that he had to make up for what he had done while working for the oil companies.

In the end, the oil companies couldn't stop the inevitable. Renewable energy became the new norm and the world became a better place. John was hailed as a hero, and his work would be remembered for generations to come.
