Jack had always considered himself a pretty normal person. He had a steady job, a decent apartment, and a group of friends he saw on weekends. But when his parent died of cancer, everything changed.

He had always been close to his mother and watched helplessly as her condition deteriorated. One day, he received a call from the hospital informing him that she had passed away during the night. Jack was heartbroken, and he spent the next few weeks in a daze, trying to process what had happened.

But a couple of months later, Jack received a call that shook him to his core. It was from his mother's number, and when he picked up, he heard her voice on the other end of the line. He couldn't believe it; his mother was dead. But as she spoke, Jack realized that something was wrong. She was asking him how he was doing, as if nothing had happened. No mention of her death, no sadness or mourning.

Jack tried to rationalize the situation, thinking that maybe he had dreamed the entire conversation. But he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. He started questioning his sanity, wondering if the grief had finally gotten to him. 

As days passed, Jack found himself dwelling on that phone call. He kept trying to make sense of it, but no matter how hard he tried, it just didn't make sense to him. It wasn't until he spoke to his friends about what was happening that Jack started to realize that something wasn't right.

None of them could remember his mother dying.

Jack spent hours scouring the internet, searching for any mention of his mother's illness or her passing. But he found nothing. No obituary, no record of her death, nothing at all to confirm that what had happened was real. 

He was lost, confused, and terrified. How could he remember something that never happened? Was he truly losing his mind? 

Jack knew he needed help, and he found it in a therapist. After weeks of sessions, he finally began to open up about the thoughts that had been plaguing him. He talked about his mother's death and the phone call, of his friends not remembering her passing, and of the terror he felt at the thought of his mind betraying him.

The therapist listened patiently, asking all the right questions and probing deeper into his memories. It was during one of these sessions that something finally clicked in Jack's mind.

His mother had always been a private person. She kept her illness largely to herself, only telling him and a select few friends about her condition. She had always been fiercely independent, and Jack respected her desire for privacy. 

But what if, in her final days, she had confided in someone else? Maybe a distant relative or an old friend. Someone who had been there for her during her final days and had seen her through to the end. Jack started to realize that it was entirely possible that someone else had been there for his mother, and now that person was covering up the truth.

With this new knowledge, Jack began his own investigation. He contacted everyone he could think of, asking questions, and trying to piece together the truth. And little by little, he started to uncover the real timeline.

His mother had died, just as he had always remembered. But in her final days, she had confided in a close friend, who had been with her when she took her last breath. That friend had gone on to spread the news of her death and had even spoken at her funeral. But something had gone wrong. The friend had gotten into some legal trouble and had fled the state, leaving no trace behind. In her rush to leave, she had neglected to inform anyone of his mother's death, knowing that Jack's mother had asked for no funeral, and said that Jack would scatter her ashes in Hawaii with her old friend, Carmen. 

Jack was relieved to know he wasn't losing his mind and grateful for the closure he now had. But he couldn't help feeling angry and betrayed, knowing that someone he had never even met had tried to take away his memories. 

In the end, though, Jack realized that he couldn't let that anger define him. His mother had always taught him to be kind and patient, even in the face of adversity. And so, he chose to honor her memory by living his life with the same grace and dignity she had shown in her final days.

And as he scattered her ashes in Hawaii alongside Carmen, he felt a sense of closure that he never thought he would find. The weight of that phone call had lifted, and he could finally move forward with his life, knowing that his mother's memory would always be there to guide him.
