You have a special bag. Whenever you reach into it, you pull out something you will need soon, but don't necessarily know you need yet. However, the things you are pulling out of the bag have been very strange recently.
Lena had always felt comforted by her special bag. She could reach inside and always find something she needed, even if she didn't yet realize it. But lately, the items she pulled out were more than just unusual - they were downright strange.

Last week, she had pulled out a small vial of bright green liquid that smelled like freshly cut grass. She couldn't imagine what she would need that for, but she put it in her purse just in case. The next day, she found herself stranded in a park with a flat tire and no phone battery. She remembered the vial and poured the liquid over the tire. To her amazement, it fully inflated within minutes.

Yesterday, she reached in and pulled out a small, intricately carved wooden box. She had no idea what was inside, but she knew it was important. Later that day, a friend invited her to a bonfire and challenged her to a game of marshmallow roasting. When Lena opened the box, she found an extra-long skewer, perfect for reaching the best roasting spots.

As strange as the items were that were coming out of her special bag, Lena had come to trust it implicitly. Who knew what other surprises awaited her inside?
