Dr. Frankenstein enters a bodybuilding competition due to a big misunderstanding
Dr. Frankenstein was a brilliant scientist with a passion for creating life. He spent months and years locked away in his laboratory, experimenting with various chemicals and techniques to bring his monstrous creations to life.

One day, while out on a walk, Dr. Frankenstein stumbled upon a flyer for a bodybuilding competition. He had never heard of such a thing before, but was intrigued by the idea of showcasing his strength and impressing others with his physical prowess.

Excited by the prospect of the competition, Dr. Frankenstein set about training rigorously every day, lifting weights and pushing his body to the limit. He was determined to win the competition and prove to the world that he was not just a mad scientist, but a force to be reckoned with.

As the day of the competition drew closer, Dr. Frankenstein's excitement grew. He spent hours perfecting his poses and flexing his muscles, eager to impress the judges and audience alike.

But when he arrived at the competition, Dr. Frankenstein quickly realized that he had made a grave mistake. Instead of a bodybuilding competition, he had entered a beauty pageant.

Confused and embarrassed, Dr. Frankenstein attempted to explain his misunderstanding to the organizers, but they simply laughed at him and told him to take his place on the stage.

Feeling humiliated, Dr. Frankenstein reluctantly stepped up onto the stage, trying his best to strike a suitably feminine pose. But when he attempted a graceful twirl, his muscles bulged and strained under the strain, making him look like a hulking beast rather than a delicate beauty.

As the audience burst into laughter, Dr. Frankenstein realized the full extent of his mistake. He had been so focused on his desire to show off his strength that he had forgotten to read the fine print on the competition flyer.

Defeated and embarrassed, Dr. Frankenstein slunk off the stage and vowed never to enter a competition again without fully understanding the rules.
