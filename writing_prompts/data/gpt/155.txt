A fisherman finds out that the river they are on is the River Styx.
Tom had always loved fishing. It was his favorite pastime and he loved nothing more than spending a lazy afternoon on the riverbank watching the world go by. Today was no exception. The weather was perfect, and he had all the right gear. With his fishing rod in hand, Tom set off across the river, ready to catch his next big fish.

He had been fishing for a while when he noticed something strange. The water had turned darker, and the sky had grown overcast. It was as if a storm was coming, but the wind was still and calm. It was eerie and unsettling, and Tom began to feel uneasy.

Suddenly, he felt a tug on his line, and he eagerly began to reel it in. But as he did, the water beneath him began to churn and bubble, and a figure emerged from the depths. It was a dark, menacing figure, with eyes that burned with an otherworldly fire.

"Who are you?" Tom asked, trembling with fear.

"I am Charon, ferryman of the River Styx," the figure replied, his voice deep and gravelly.

"The River Styx? But that's the river of the dead," Tom exclaimed, his eyes widening in horror.

Charon nodded his head gravely. "Indeed it is. You are not supposed to be here."

Tom tried to reel in his line, to flee, but it was stuck fast. The ferryman had a tight grasp on it now.

"You've upset the balance of things," the ferryman said. "You've brought death into the world of the living, and that is not something that can be taken lightly."

Tom was terrified. He had never believed in ghosts or demons, but now he was face to face with the only myth he had ever truly feared. 

The ferryman's stern face slowly relaxed as Tom explained that he had no knowledge of the river he was on, and he had never intended to summon any kind of evil. Had he known, he would've never dared to cast his line here. He was a simple man who loved to fish, he had no interest in the underworld or anything of that sort.

Charon listened attentively, and finally, spoke: "You appear to be an honest man. I will let you go this time, but don't ever go near the River Styx again. I don't want to see you here again."

As quickly as the menacing figure had appeared, it disappeared into the depths of the water, leaving Tom alone with his thoughts and the sound of the river. He packed up his gear and left, far wiser in his appreciation of the unseen worlds right beneath the surface.
