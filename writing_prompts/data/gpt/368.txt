Once upon a time, there was a young woman named Emily who moved to a quaint small town to escape the chaos of city life. She found a small cottage that suited her perfectly and began to settle into her new home. Emily was an avid gardener and spent most of her days tending to her flowers and vegetables. 

One day, while tending to her garden, Emily noticed a strange man lurking in the distance. He was watching her with a peculiar intensity that made her uneasy. Emily tried to shake off the feeling and continued with her gardening. Over the next few days, she saw the man again and again, always watching her from a distance. 

Emily decided to confront the man and asked him why he was watching her. He simply grinned and said, "You have a lovely garden. I'm just admiring it." With a sinking feeling, Emily realized the man was not admiring her garden, but her. She became increasingly fearful of this man's presence and spent all of her time cooped up inside her house, watching and waiting. 

One night, Emily woke up to a loud banging at her door. She peered through the peephole and saw the man standing outside, with a maniacal grin on his face. "I just wanted to tell you," he said, "Your flowers are dying." Emily's terrified scream echoed into the night.
