As Christmas approached in the Commonwealth, parents began to tell their children the story of old Saint Nick. They recounted tales of a jolly old man who would traverse the wasteland on his trusty reindeer, delivering gifts to those who had been good.

The children listened intently as their parents spoke of a time before the war, when Christmas was a time of joy and celebration. They heard stories of bright lights, festive music, and a warm hearth where families would gather together.

Though the wasteland was a harsh and dangerous place, the children took comfort in the idea that there was someone out there spreading joy and cheer. They shared their hopes and dreams with each other, imagining what gifts Saint Nick might bring them.

As Christmas Eve drew near, the children nestled into their beds, eagerly awaiting the arrival of old Saint Nick. And though the wasteland may be a dark and dangerous place, the children's spirits were lifted by the hope and magic of the holiday season.
