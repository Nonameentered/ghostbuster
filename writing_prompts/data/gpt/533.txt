The hero was always a thorn in our side. He'd come into our lair and slaughter us without a second thought. We feared him and his magic sword. But one day, fate smiled upon me. He was alone when I saw him, and I struck fast. My claws went for his throat, and I never let go until his pulse stopped. I was in shock, as were the other goblins. Our tables had turned, and we were unsure what to do next. But eventually, we celebrated. We celebrated my newfound strength and our freedom from the hero's tyranny. We never would have thought that a lowly goblin like me could slay the hero, but now we know that anything is possible. We'll always remember this victory, and maybe even tell the story of how a common goblin became the hero of our story.
