You wake up one morning and find the devil at the foot of your bed. His eyes find yours, he taps your foot and says, 'You're it,' then disintegrates.
I woke up one morning to find the devil sitting at the foot of my bed. His eyes glowed a fiery red as his sinister smile stretched across his face. My heart pounded in my chest as fear coursed through my veins.

Before I could even open my mouth to scream, the devil tapped my foot and muttered, "You're it."

To my surprise, the devil began to disintegrate before my very eyes. Suddenly, everything went black, and I found myself standing in a barren desert wasteland.

My senses went into overdrive as I frantically tried to remember what had happened. I felt lost and alone, with no idea of how to navigate this strange new world.

As I scanned the empty horizon, a small flicker of light caught my eye. I stumbled towards it, desperate for some sort of guidance.

After what felt like hours of walking, I finally reached the source of the flicker- a small campfire. Sitting beside it was an old man with a kind smile.

The man explained that I had been chosen to play a game with the devil. If I made it through the game unscathed, I would be granted one wish of my choosing.

With newfound determination, I decided to take on the challenge. Though it was full of twists and turns, I managed to win the game, and the devil granted me my wish.

As soon as I made my wish, I woke up to find myself back in my own bed. It all felt like a dream, but the memory of the devil's chilling presence stayed with me.
