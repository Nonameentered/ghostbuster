You are being stalked by an unseen creature in the forest.
It all started with a camping trip gone wrong. My friends and I thought it would be fun to spend a weekend in the forest, away from the busy city and our everyday responsibilities. We packed our tents, sleeping bags, and all the necessary gear, and headed out on Friday afternoon.

We found a nice spot by a small creek, not too far from the hiking trail. The weather was ideal, and we spent the first day exploring the area, cooking food over the campfire, and sharing stories and jokes. As the night fell, we settled in our tents, exhausted but excited for the rest of our adventure.

That’s when I first heard it.

A rustling in the bushes, just outside my tent. I tried to brush it off, thinking it was just an animal passing by. But the rustling didn’t stop. It continued for hours, slowly driving me crazy and preventing me from getting any sleep. I told myself that I was just paranoid, that it was probably a raccoon or a deer. But the longer it lasted, the more uneasy I became.

The next morning, my friends and I packed up our camp and hiked further into the forest, hoping to find a better spot. But the rustling followed me, getting louder and more persistent. I asked my friends if they heard it too, but they always said no, giving me strange looks.

At first, I thought it was just my imagination, or maybe a prank my friends were playing on me. But things started to get more serious.

Late one night, I left the camp to go pee. As I was walking back to my tent, I heard something breathing heavily behind me. I froze for a moment, before slowly turning around. But there was nothing there, just the darkness and silence of the forest.

The next day, I woke up to find that all my food and water supply had been tampered with. Some of my items were missing, and the ones that remained had been opened or broken. I suspected that it was my friends playing a practical joke, but when I confronted them, they all denied it, looking genuinely confused and concerned.

That’s when I realized that I was being stalked by an unseen creature in the forest.

I tried to rationalize it, to think of other explanations, but nothing made sense. I started to keep watch at night, sitting outside my tent with a flashlight and a knife. I didn’t know what I was dealing with, but I knew that it was dangerous. The rustling had turned into growling and snarling, and sometimes I could hear footsteps circling around our camp. It felt like whatever it was, it was getting closer.

My friends started to notice that I was acting strange, and I could tell they were getting worried. I didn’t want to scare them, but I also knew that I couldn’t keep quiet about it anymore. I told them what was going on, and to my surprise, they believed me. They stayed up with me, keeping watch and trying to create a plan.

But then something happened that changed everything.

One of my friends, a guy named Dave, disappeared in the middle of the night.

At first, we thought he was just going on a walk, or maybe taking a bathroom break. But when he didn’t come back for hours, we knew something was wrong. We searched the entire area, calling out his name and shining our flashlights in every direction. But he was nowhere to be found.

We set up a perimeter, creating a makeshift barrier of branches and rocks. We put out traps and alarms, hoping to catch whatever was stalking us. I wasn’t sure what I was feeling at that moment - fear, anger, desperation. All I knew was that I had to find my friend, before it was too late.

As the night wore on, I started to lose hope. I was exhausted, my nerves frayed, and I didn’t know what to do next. That’s when I saw it - a shape moving in the darkness, just beyond our barrier.

I aimed my flashlight at it, heart pounding, and saw a pair of glowing eyes staring back at me.

It was the creature.

I don’t know what happened next. All I remember is running towards it, yelling, brandishing my knife. I could hear my friends behind me, shouting my name. When I reached the creature, I don’t know what I was expecting - maybe a wild dog, or a bear, or something else. But what stood before me was something I had never seen before.

It was humanoid, but covered in fur and scales. Its eyes were large and yellow, with slit pupils that seemed to glow in the dark. Its limbs were long and muscular, ending in sharp claws. It stood on two legs, but hunched over, almost like a gorilla. And it was snarling, showing off rows of razor-sharp teeth.

For a moment, I froze. I had never seen anything like it, and my mind couldn’t process what I was seeing. But then it attacked, lunging towards me with incredible speed.

I fought back, swinging my knife blindly, trying to protect myself. I could hear my friends shouting, and the sound of traps snapping shut. It was chaos - a flurry of movement, noise, and instincts.

But somehow, we managed to defeat it. I heard it howling, thrashing on the ground, before going quiet. When we approached it cautiously, we saw that it was dead. Its body was covered in wounds, and blood was pooling around it.

We buried it deep in the forest, not wanting to attract any unwanted attention. We also found Dave, who had been knocked out and hidden in a nearby cave. He was shaken but unhurt, and we all hugged each other, grateful to be alive.

We never spoke of it again, not wanting to remember the horror of that night. But I knew that it would haunt me forever. The memory of the unseen creature in the forest, stalking me, still sends shivers down my spine.
