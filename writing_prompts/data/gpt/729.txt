I was walking home from the library, lost in thought about my upcoming exams, when suddenly a man jumped out from an alleyway. He was tall, with wild eyes and a knife in his hand. My heart pounded in my chest as he demanded I hand over my wallet.

Without hesitation, I reached into my backpack and pulled out a pack of cards. The mugger looked at me with confusion for a moment before sneering and demanding the cards.

"Sure thing," I said, tossing the deck to him. As he caught them, I darted past him and took off down the street.

I could hear the man shouting and cursing behind me, but I didn't stop until I was safely back in my apartment. As I sat down to catch my breath, I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of the situation. Who knew a pack of cards could be such a valuable weapon?
