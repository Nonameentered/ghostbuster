When Lisa rubbed the old lamp she found while on an archaeological dig, she never expected a genie to pop out. But one did, and she made a wish for a million dollars. Instead of granting her wish literally, the genie gave her the idea to start her own business and work hard to earn the money. She took his advice and started a successful company that made her a millionaire in no time.

Lisa was amazed when she made another wish for a new car, and instead of receiving a physical car, the genie suggested that she focus on her health and fitness and take care of her mind and body. This led her to take up yoga and meditation, which improved her overall health and wellness.

While other people may have been frustrated with a genie who didn't literally grant their wishes, Lisa was grateful for the lessons she learned from her figurative genie. In the end, she realized that sometimes the best way to get what you want is by working hard and changing your own mindset.
