Rewrite a story that you originally wrote as a kid.
Once upon a time, when I was a young child, I wrote a story about a brave princess who saved her kingdom from a fierce dragon. It was a simple plot, but it was full of adventure and excitement. Now, as an adult, I want to revisit that story and rewrite it with a more mature perspective.

In my new version, the princess’s name is Isabella. She is the youngest daughter of the King and Queen of the land of Arden. Isabella is not content with her privileged life inside the walls of the castle. She yearns for adventure and wants to see what lies beyond the borders of her kingdom.

One day, the King’s army returns from a battle, bearing news that a monstrous dragon has taken up residence in a nearby forest. The dragon has been terrorizing villages and burning down farms. It seems invincible, and none of the knights have been able to defeat it.

Isabella is fascinated by the idea of facing the dragon and saving her people. She knows that her father would never let her go, so she sneaks out of the castle at night, disguised as a commoner. She travels to the villages at the edge of the forest, where she hears the dragon has been spotted.

As she makes her way through the forest, she meets a group of traveling merchants. They tell her that they have seen the dragon, and that it is impenetrable, save for a small gap between its scales on its chest. But getting close enough to the dragon to exploit this weakness is near impossible. The merchants warn Isabella that she should turn back while she still can.

However, Isabella is not one to give up so easily. She asks the merchants to take her as close to the dragon as they can. They reluctantly agree, and they travel together deeper into the forest.

After a long journey, they finally see the dragon in the distance. It is a huge, terrifying creature that towers over the trees. Isabella can feel her nerves starting to fray, and she second-guesses her decision to come to the forest. But she remembers the people who are suffering because of the dragon, and she knows she cannot back down.

The merchants leave her and she makes her way toward the dragon, heart pounding in her chest. The dragon spots her, and with a deafening roar, it rises into the sky. It breathes fire and smoke, and Isabella prepares for her certain death. 

But then she realizes that the merchants were right; the dragon has a gap between its scales on its chest. She takes a deep breath and runs straight at the dragon. As the dragon swoops down towards her to gobble her up, she leaps forward and thrusts her knife at the dragon. 

The knife slips through the gap and into the dragon’s heart. The dragon falls to the ground, dead. The crowd cheers and Isabella becomes a hero.

However, her triumph is short-lived. As she tries to make her way back to the kingdom, she is captured by a group of bandits. They see that she is a princess and start making plans to take her to the highest bidder.

Isabella is now even farther from home and desperate for a way out of her predicament. She befriends the bandit leader’s wife, and they hatch a plan to escape. They make a daring break for freedom, and Isabella leads them through the forest, her bravery and quick thinking saving them time and time again.

Finally, they reach the border of Arden. Isabella is emotional at the sight of her kingdom, and the thought that she was going to save her people. 

But as they cross the border, they see that Arden has also been taken over by a powerful enemy - the neighboring kingdom, Margred. Isabella sees the suffering of her people, and the destruction wrought by the Margred army. She knows she must act quickly, or her people will suffer more casualties.

Isabella rallies the remaining Arden forces, convincing them that victory is possible. They launch a surprise attack on the Margred army, the fierce battle leaving Isabella’s hand feeling like it was on fire, yet ever stronger with each moment that passed. Beaten and broken, the Margred army is forced to retreat.

Isabella rides out on a white horse, her blue cape trailing behind her as she gallops through the ranks of her cheering soldiers. She leads triumphantly to the castle, where her father awaits. He sees Isabella for the hero she truly is and thanks her from the bottom of his heart.

With the victory, not only is Isabella hailed throughout her kingdom as a hero, but she also finds herself beloved by the neighboring kingdoms. She is offered everything she could ever want, to become anything anyone could ever be --- but she remains humble, Carrying on with her steadfast character and proving that anyone can be a hero - no matter their status - as long as they have bravery and a pure heart. 

And so ends the story of the once young princess, now an older, wiser queen, who saved her kingdom from the evil of a dragon and the tyranny of an evil neighboring kingdom. With the tests of courage and fortitude under her belt, Queen Isabella lives a long and peaceful life, always striving to fight battles for the people who need her most.
