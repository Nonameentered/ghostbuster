Make a character with as much sympathy as possible. Now, in a realistic and non-over the top manner, make me lose all sympathy for them.
Charlotte was a single mom with two young children, working two jobs just to make ends meet. Despite her hectic schedule, she always made time for her kids, volunteering at their school and coaching their soccer team. She was well-loved in her community for her kind heart and selfless nature.

One day, Charlotte was on her way home from her evening shift at the diner when she spotted a young boy wandering the streets alone. She pulled over and asked him if he was lost. The boy, who looked no more than six years old, told her he didn't know where his parents were and he was scared.

Without a second thought, Charlotte offered to take the boy in for the night, promising to help him find his parents the next day. She brought him to her modest apartment, where her own children were already asleep. She gave the boy a warm meal and tucked him into bed.

The next morning, Charlotte started calling local hospitals and police stations in search of the boy's parents. As she made the rounds, she left the boy with a trusted neighbor, who also offered to help. 

But as the day wore on, Charlotte grew increasingly frustrated with the boy. He was hyperactive and mischievous, always running around and getting into things. He broke one of her favorite vases and spilled juice on the carpets. Charlotte found herself snapping at him more and more, shouting whenever he did something wrong. 

When evening fell and there was still no news of the boy's parents, Charlotte could barely contain her anger. She was exhausted from a long day of work and now had to deal with this unruly child. She started to regret taking him in, wishing she had just called the police instead. 

As the night wore on, the boy's behavior only got worse. He refused to go to bed, instead running around the apartment and screaming. Charlotte tried her best to get him to calm down, but she was too tired and short-tempered. 

Finally, in a fit of frustration, she grabbed the boy by the arm and pulled him into his room. She slammed the door shut and told him to stay put. But when she woke up the next morning, she found the room empty. The boy had run away during the night. 

Charlotte searched frantically for him, calling the police and scouring the streets. But it was too late. The boy was gone, and it was all her fault. She had been so caught up in her own problems and frustrations that she failed to show the kindness and compassion that had earned her so much respect in her community. 

Charlotte never forgot the boy, or the terrible mistake she had made. She learned a hard lesson about the dangers of losing control and forgetting the importance of empathy. But it was too late to regain the sympathy and admiration of those who had once looked up to her.
