Tell me the story of legends such as King Midas or Achilles, but they have to be soldiers in World War 1.
Once upon a time, in the midst of World War 1, there were two legends fighting in the trenches. King Midas was known for his golden touch, but now his hands were calloused from the endless hours gripping his gun. Achilles, the greatest warrior of his time, now struggled in the mud and blood of the battlefield.

The war had turned both of these heroes into mere men, but their reputation preceded them. Soldiers whispered tales of their feats and courage, giving hope to those who fought alongside them and spreading fear among their enemies.

One day, as the two friends were trudging through the muddy ground, they came upon an injured soldier. He lay there, wounded and helpless, surrounded by the chaos of the war. King Midas knelt beside him, offering comfort while Achilles examined his wounds.

It was then that they noticed something strange. The soldier’s gun was glowing with a golden light. King Midas recognized the shimmer, and without thinking, he touched the weapon. As expected, it turned to pure gold in his hands.

The legend of his golden touch had not abandoned him, even on the battlefield. But this time, it offered no comfort or joy. King Midas was horrified by what he had done.

“You see,” he said to Achilles, “my gift has always been a curse. I can never touch anything without turning it to gold. I am cursed to never feel the human touch.” His words were heavy, weighted with the burden of his power.

Achilles tried to comfort his friend, but he knew the futility of his words. They could not change what had happened, and they could not heal the soldier’s wounds. But they could fight on. And so they did.

Days passed, and the war raged on. The two legends fought valiantly, never giving up hope that one day, the madness would end. One day, they received orders to attack an enemy unit.

They charged forward, their guns blazing. But the enemy was skilled, and they were outnumbered. Achilles fought bravely, his spear piercing the enemy, but King Midas’ golden touch proved to be a disadvantage. He could not risk touching any of the enemy guns, for fear of accidentally turning them to gold.

But King Midas was not one to give up easily. He saw a way to use his curse as a weapon. He grabbed his grenade, careful not to touch it with his bare hands, and hurled it towards the enemy line. The golden grenade exploded, sending shrapnel flying in all directions. The enemy was taken aback, and the Allied forces seized the opportunity to push forward.

The two legends continued to fight, side by side, until the war was won. They returned home, decorated and praised for their bravery on the battlefield. But they could never forget the horrors they had seen. They had lost friends, witnessed unthinkable acts, and been forced to confront their own mortality.

They never spoke of the golden touch incident again, but it became something of a legend among their fellow soldiers. The story of King Midas and Achilles, the two soldiers who could never be defeated, continued to inspire and awe those who heard it.

As for the two friends, they remained humble and grateful for the opportunity to fight for their country. They had seen what the world was capable of, and they knew that peace was something worth fighting for.

And so they lived out the rest of their days, ex-soldiers turned legends, forever marked by their experiences on the battlefield.
