'You have the best memory in the world. So good in fact that you have memories from before you were born'
I always knew I had a remarkable memory, but little did I know that it extended beyond my own existence. As a child, I would tell stories to my parents about events that happened before I was born, things that I couldn't possibly know about. They would look at me, amazed, as I spoke about their first date or the time they got lost on a road trip. 

As I grew older, my memory only became more impressive. I could recall the names and faces of people I had met briefly years ago, the details of conversations had in passing. But then, something extraordinary happened. I began to remember things from before my birth. 

It started small, a memory of a song my mother played while she was pregnant with me, but soon it snowballed into a flurry of memories. I remembered the sound of my parents' voices, the way they spoke to each other. I remembered my mother's heartbeat, the feel of being cradled in my father's arms. 

I didn't understand how it was possible, how I could remember things from before I existed. But it didn't matter. Those memories were a part of me, just as much as my own experiences. And now, I cherish them just as much.
