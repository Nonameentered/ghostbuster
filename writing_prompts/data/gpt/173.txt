A good friend routinely greets you, 'I see my assassins have failed again!' and a laugh. You took it as a joke. It turns out competent assassins are expensive and he only makes minimum wage.
I had known my best friend, Peter, for as long as I could remember. He was always a joker and his sense of humor included his routine greeting of, “I see my assassins have failed again!” He would always follow it up with a laugh and it had become a running joke between us.

Naturally, I never put much thought into those words. They were just Peter being Peter - a little weird but always funny. It wasn’t until one day when I noticed him looking down that I realized he might actually be struggling.

I had just gotten paid and was feeling generous, so I offered to take us out for lunch. As we sat down, I grew concerned when Peter seemed hesitant to order anything. Finally, I asked what was wrong.

“It’s just that… well, I don’t want to burden you or anything, but things have been a little tight lately,” he said, looking at the menu but not really seeing it.

“What do you mean?” I pressed.

“It’s nothing, really. I just haven’t been making as much as I need to make ends meet,” he said, shrugging.

I didn’t want to push him if he wasn’t comfortable sharing, but something about his demeanor made me insist.

“Peter, I’m your friend. If you need help, just tell me.”

He hesitated a moment before finally admitting, “Okay, it’s just… competent assassins are really expensive.”

I was taken aback. Was he joking? I didn’t know what to say.

“Wait, what do you mean?” I asked, trying to make sense of the bizarre comment.

He hesitated again before finally admitting, “I mean my routine greeting isn’t just a joke. I really do have people who want me dead. They’re not very good at their jobs, but they’re still there.”

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Surely, this had to be a joke. But as we sat there, I could see the desperation in his eyes, and I knew he was telling the truth.

“To make matters worse,” he continued, “I don’t even make enough to hire competent assassins. I’m barely making minimum wage as it is.”

I didn’t know what to do with this information. My funny, carefree friend was actually in danger and struggling to make ends meet. I felt like a terrible friend for not realizing sooner.

“Peter, I had no idea. Why didn’t you tell me sooner?” I asked, feeling guilty for not noticing the signs.

“I didn’t want to burden you,” he said, looking down at his hands.

“Well, consider yourself unburdened,” I replied, determined to help him in any way I could.

Over the next few weeks, I made it my mission to help Peter find a way out of this mess. We did research on self-defense techniques, looked at ways to make his home more secure, and even talked to a lawyer about filing a restraining order. I also offered to lend him money, but he was too proud to accept the offer.

As we sat in his living room one night, mulling over our options, Peter suddenly sat up and exclaimed, “Wait! I just had an idea!”

“Okay, what’s up?” I asked, willing to listen to anything.

“Remember how I used to make those prank videos for YouTube?” he asked, a mischievous glint in his eye.

“Of course,” I said, remembering the hilarious videos of Peter pulling pranks on unsuspecting strangers.

“What if we did that again?” he said, excitement building in his voice. “But instead of pranking strangers, we prank my assassins! We can film it, put it on YouTube, and make some money!”

I have to admit, the idea sounded insane. But it was also kind of brilliant.

“Okay, let’s hear it,” I said, intrigued.

Peter went on to explain his plan, which involved setting up fake scenarios where his assassins would try to attack him, only for him to turn the tables in hilarious ways. We spent the next few weeks planning and filming, and I have to say, it was some of the most fun I’ve ever had.

When we finally put the videos up on YouTube, it was an instant hit. People loved the idea of a regular guy outsmarting his would-be killers, and we quickly gained a following. The ad revenue wasn’t much at first, but as we uploaded more and more videos, it started to add up.

It wasn’t long before we had enough money to hire an actual security team to protect Peter. They took over the job of tracking down his would-be assailants and keeping him safe. And while the threat was never fully eliminated, Peter was finally able to relax a little and enjoy his life.

Looking back, I’m amazed at how far we’ve come. What started as a harmless joke between friends turned into a real-life crisis, but instead of breaking us apart, it brought us closer together. We showed the world that even when things are at their darkest, laughter can still be the best medicine. And now, every time Peter greets me with, “I see my assassins have failed again!” we both laugh, knowing just how far we’ve come.
