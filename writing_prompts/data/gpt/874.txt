Everyone wakes up with a number and a RPG-esque classification (e.g., Thief, Warrior, Cleric, etc.) tattooed on their dominant arm
When Evan woke up that morning, he felt different. It wasn't just the number 72 tattooed on his left arm, it was the feeling of being designated as a "Mage." He had always loved magic, but never imagined that he would be classified as one.

As the day progressed, Evan noticed that everyone had a number and a classification tattooed on their dominant arm. He saw "Warriors" with numbers in the 100s, "Thieves" with numbers in the 200s, and "Clerics" with numbers in the 300s. He wondered what it all meant, and if there was a reason why everyone woke up with these markings.

As he walked to work, he noticed another "Mage" walking alongside him. They introduced themselves and quickly bonded over their shared love of magic. The other "Mage" had a lower number than Evan, and explained that the numbers represented a person's level of skill.

Evan soon realized that the markings were more than just a cosmetic change. Everyone's classification and number affected their abilities and strengths. They were living in a full-blown RPG world.

As the days passed, Evan became more comfortable with his designation. He practiced his magic, honed his skills, and discovered that he was quite powerful. He learned that there were factions based on their classification, forming alliances and waging war against each other.

Evan found himself drawn to the "Heroes," a group dedicated to saving people and keeping the peace. They were made up of a variety of classifications, each bringing their unique abilities to the table.

But as the days turned into weeks, Evan noticed a darkness taking hold on the world. While the "Heroes" were fighting to maintain order, the "Villains" were gaining power. The Villains banded together, taking over cities, and enslaving the populace.

Evan knew he had to act. He rallied a small group of Heroes and decided to take on the Villains head-on. They battled fiercely, each side showing their full capabilities. Evan's magic was key in taking down some of the Villains, but they were vastly outnumbered.

In the end, the Heroes were able to defeat the Villains, but at great cost. Many lives were lost, and the world was forever changed. Evan had never felt more alive than he did in that moment. He had discovered a whole new world within his own, and had come out victorious.

As Evan looked at the number on his arm, now a higher level, he knew that his journey was far from over. There would always be battles to fight, and new allies to make. But he was proud of what he had accomplished, and that he had found his true calling as a Mage.
