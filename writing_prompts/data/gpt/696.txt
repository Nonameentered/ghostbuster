As I lay on my death bed, weak and barely able to lift my head, I felt a presence in the room. I turned my head to the left and saw a figure hovering over me. It was the personification of my greatest regret.

I felt a sense of relief knowing that it had come to say goodbye. For years, I had carried the weight of this regret, and it had haunted me every step of the way. It had lingered in the shadows, waiting for the right moment to make itself known. And now, on my death bed, it had finally come to close this chapter once and for all.

"Hello," I said weakly, my voice barely above a whisper. There was a moment of silence, and then my regret spoke.

"I'm sorry," it said in a voice that was both familiar and foreign. "I'm sorry for everything."

I closed my eyes, tears streaming down my face. The weight of the regret was lifting, and I felt at peace.

"I forgive you," I said softly, opening my eyes. "I forgive you, and I hope you can forgive me."

My regret smiled, a warm and gentle smile. "It's time to go," it said, and then it was gone.

As I took my last breath, I felt a sense of peace and closure. I was ready to face whatever came next, knowing that my regret was no longer with me. The weight had been lifted, and I was free.
