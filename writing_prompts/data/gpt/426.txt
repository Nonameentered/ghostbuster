Satan had spent eons in the hellish fires, regretting his harsh stance against God. His heart had softened, and he longed to recant his mistakes and plead to be allowed back into Heaven as Lucifer.

When he finally approached God, God had a caveat: Satan had to prove his reform by resisting a tempting opportunity to sin.

Admittedly, Satan was nervous. He had spent eternity relishing in the pain of others. For once in his existence, he wanted to show restraint.

So, one day, God presented him with a golden key. "This unlocks the gates of the mortal world," God said. "But you must resist going through them and causing chaos."

Satan grasped the key and felt its weight in his hand. He could already feel the tug of temptationâ€”it would be so easy. Yet, on this occasion, Satan chose differently than what he would have done in the past. He handed the key back to God and was welcomed back to Heaven as Lucifer.
