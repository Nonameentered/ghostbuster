In a world where news networks constantly compete for viewership, a new concept was introduced: burners. Humans specially bred and trained to cause chaos and disturbances for the sake of news stories. 

One such burner was Harper. Raised in isolation and devoid of any emotional attachment, Harper was taught to carry out elaborate pranks, start riots, and disrupt events all for the benefit of the news networks. 

Harper's most notable act involved hijacking a newly developed transportation system, wreaking havoc across the city and causing a massive police pursuit. The news networks couldn't get enough of the adrenaline-fueled spectacle, and Harper's notoriety skyrocketed.

But as Harper grew older, the toll of years of causing chaos weighed heavy. Harper began to question the morality of their actions and the true cost of their fame. Slowly drifting towards self-destruction, Harper's final act of chaos was the destruction of the very system that created them. 

And with that, Harper disappeared without a trace, leaving the news networks to scramble for the next big story.
