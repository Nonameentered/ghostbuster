'Visitors are reminded that flash photography is not permitted, as it may disturb the corpses.'
The old castle was said to be a haunted place, full of ghosts and could send shivers down even the bravest of hearts. It was also famous for the priceless artifacts displayed there, attracting tourists from all over the world. Recently, the authorities had issued a warning to all visitors, reminding them that flash photography was not permitted, as it may disturb the corpses.

A group of three friends, Anika, Asad, and Noah, arrived at the castle early that day, eager to explore the old ruins and snap pictures of the ancient relics. They were accompanied by a tour guide who reminded them of the warning as they entered.

Anika, who was carrying a camera, raised her hand to take a shot when she suddenly saw the guide's expression change. Before she could ask, she heard a noise behind her. Turning around, she saw a ghostly figure floating near the window, making strange noises.

Suddenly, the entire room was filled with a blinding flash of light, accompanied by a loud sound. The group was startled and looked around to see what had caused it. Anika's camera had gone off by accident. The guide looked at the group, shaking his head, and reminded them of the warning once again.

As they moved from room to room, listening to the guide's stories, they saw more and more warning signs posted everywhere. It seemed like they were walking amongst the dead inhabiting the castle. The trio began to feel uncomfortable as though they were being watched by something that couldn't be seen.

Finally, they reached a dimly lit room where they saw a shadowy figure lurking in the background. The ghost appeared to be disturbed and agitated by the group's presence, and they knew they had overstayed their welcome. They quickly left the room behind, feeling that they had done enough sightseeing for one day.

From that day forward, the friends never forgot the warning posted throughout the castle, as they realized they had indeed disturbed the corpses unknowingly and may have earned a few new ghostly acquaintances.
