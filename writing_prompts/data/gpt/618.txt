I had always known that my life would end the way it started - with a bullet. But what I had never expected was to be given the ultimate task of assassinating the one person who had ever cared for me - my mother.

I had been a hitman for as long as I could remember, a true professional. To me, death was always just business. I had been responsible for several international assassinations, some executed so well they appeared natural. But there was always that voice in the back of my head reminding me that my next contract could be my last.

When my employer called me in for what he said would be my last job before retiring, I had been relieved. After years of living on the edge, it was time to hang up my guns and retire into the shadows.

But when he handed me the file, I froze. The picture staring back at me was my mother's.

My mother - the one person who had always been there for me, who had always believed in me, who had always loved me. How could I take her life? I couldn't fathom the thought, it was just too much.

I tried to tell my employer that I couldn't do it, but he reminded me that this was the life I chose. That every time I had taken a contract, I had known the risks. That if I didn't complete this job, he would make sure I was eliminated.

As I left his office, my mind was racing. How could I kill my own mother? How could I live with myself if I did? But if I didn't, I would be signing my own death warrant.

Days passed, and I found myself following my mother's every move, gathering intel and planning out her termination. But every time I looked at her, I saw my own reflection. I saw the love in her eyes, the gentle way she moved through the world. How could I take her away from all of that?

In the end, I made the decision. I couldn't do it. After all the lives I had taken, after all the blood on my hands, my mother was the one person I couldn't bring myself to kill.

I disappeared into the shadows, knowing that my employer would eventually come for me. But at least I had spared my mother's life, and in doing so, given myself a chance at redemption.

In that moment, I knew that I had finally found the one thing I had been missing all these years - my humanity. And as I left my old life behind, I vowed to never forget the sacrifices that had led me to this moment, and to make amends for the lives lost in my wake.
