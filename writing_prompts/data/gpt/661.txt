Harry Potter sat nervously on the chair with the sorting hat on his head. It was his first day of school at Hogwarts, and he had been eagerly waiting for this moment for so long. He closed his eyes and repeated the word "Gryffindor" over and over again, hoping that the hat would hear his plea.

But suddenly, the sorting hat paused, and Harry's heart skipped a beat. What was happening? Had he done something wrong? Before he could even comprehend what was going on, the hat's voice boomed out, "Slytherin!"

Harry couldn't believe what he had just heard. Slytherin? Wasn't that the house of the bad guys, the house of the dark wizards? He had always imagined himself in Gryffindor, alongside his parents and other noble and brave witches and wizards.

As Harry made his way to the Slytherin table, he felt lost and confused. He was greeted with cold glares and whispers from his new housemates. But amidst all the chaos and confusion, Harry knew one thing for sure - he wouldn't let this define him. He would prove them wrong and show them that he may be in the house of the cunning, but he had a heart full of bravery and loyalty.
