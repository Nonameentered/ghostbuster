As I walked into the Grammar Police headquarters, I couldn't help but feel nervous. Today was my first day on the job, and I was eager to make a good impression.

I was greeted by my new boss, who handed me a badge and a rulebook outlining the new international law, UN-334772G. The law stated that it was now a crime to post online content containing bad grammar.

My task was to scour through social media platforms looking for offenders. I was equipped with state-of-the-art software that could detect any grammatical error in real-time.

At first, it was easy. I found dozens of offenders in my first hour, with grammatical mistakes ranging from misplaced commas to incorrect use of homophones. I issued warnings to the offenders and gave them 24 hours to correct their mistake before they were reported.

As the day went by, I started noticing patterns in the mistakes. It seemed like people were getting lazier, relying heavily on autocorrecting software. I also noticed a surge in the use of emoticons, which is not permissible under the law.

As I continued to police social media, my concentration started to wane. Hours of staring at a screen and scrolling through poorly written content were exhausting me.

Just as I was about to call it for the day, the software alerted me to a post containing severe grammatical errors. I quickly identified the author and sent out a warning. But, this offender had been previously reported, and the time for warnings was over. I had to report them.

As I logged out for the day, I couldn't help but feel conflicted. Was this really what I signed up for? Policing people's online grammar and reporting them to the authorities?

As I walked out, I wondered if this law was truly the way to preserve the sanctity of the English language, or if it was just another way for those in power to exert control over others.

My first day on the job had been an eye-opening experience, and I wasn't sure if it was something I wanted to keep doing.
