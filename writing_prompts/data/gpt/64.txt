A time traveller interviews major historical figures at three points in their lives: Their 16th birthday, the day after they made their most important decision, and the day before they die.
As a time traveler, I had the privilege of meeting many remarkable people throughout history. I decided to embark on a mission to interview major historical figures at three key points in their lives: their 16th birthday, the day after they made their most important decision, and the day before they died.

My first subject was Marie Curie. I materialized in her bedroom in Warsaw on November 7, 1885, the day after her 16th birthday. She was sitting at her desk piled with books and papers, reading a scientific journal.

I introduced myself and explained my mission. Marie looked at me as if I was from another planet but agreed to answer my questions. I asked what she hoped to achieve in her life. She replied that she wanted to become a scientist, study physics and chemistry, and make discoveries that would help people.

I then inquired about what she thought might be her biggest obstacle. Without hesitation, she answered, "Society's prejudice against women studying science." She believed that her gender would be a disadvantage, but she was determined to prove them wrong. I wished her good luck and disappeared, leaving a bewildered teenage Marie alone in her room.

The next time I met Marie was on July 13, 1898, in her lab at the School of Industrial Physics and Chemistry in Paris, the day after she and Pierre had discovered radium. She was full of excitement, describing how they had used an instrument called a electrometer to measure the electrical charge of uranium and discovered that it was giving off more energy than it was receiving. She had hypothesized that this was due to the presence of an unknown radioactive material.

I congratulated her on her achievement, but I sensed a tinge of sadness in her voice. I asked her if something was bothering her. She confided that Pierre was unhappy and felt that he wasn't getting enough credit for their discovery. He was busy with other projects and didn't share her passion for radioactivity. She was worried that their collaboration was coming to an end.

I advised her to persevere and reminded her of the importance of their work. I told her that their discovery was groundbreaking, and it would pave the way for countless advances in medicine and technology. I urged her not to give up and to have faith that things would work out.

My final meeting with Marie was on July 4, 1934, the day before her death. She was frail and bedridden, but her mind was still sharp. She greeted me with a weak smile and thanked me for visiting her.

I asked her about her life and what she considered her greatest accomplishment. She replied that it was her discovery of radium and polonium and how she had applied them to treat cancer patients in the field of radiation therapy. She said that she was proud to have been the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize and the first person to receive two in different fields.

I then asked her if she had any regrets. She pondered for a moment and said that she wished she had spent more time with her family and children. She had devoted so much of her life to her research that she had neglected her personal life. She wished she had found a better balance.

I thanked her for her time and wished her a peaceful passing. As I left her bedroom, I couldn't help but feel a sense of gratitude for having met and spoken to one of the most remarkable women in history.

My next subject was Abraham Lincoln. I first met him in his log cabin in Kentucky on February 12, 1826, the day after his 16th birthday. He was tall and lanky, dressed in rough clothes, but his piercing blue eyes shone with intelligence.

I asked him what he hoped to achieve in life. He replied that he wanted to study law and become a successful lawyer and politician. He believed that he could make a difference and help end slavery, which he saw as an evil institution.

When I met him again on January 2, 1863, in the White House, he had just signed the Emancipation Proclamation, a decision that would go down in history as one of the most significant events in American history.

I congratulated him on his decision and asked him how he had managed to overcome the opposition he had faced. He replied that he had relied on his conscience and the Constitution, which he believed was on his side. He said that he had fervently believed in the cause he was fighting for, and he was willing to make great sacrifices to achieve it.

My final meeting with Lincoln was on April 14, 1865, the day before his assassination. He was sitting in his office, exhausted and saddened by the recent events of the Civil War and his family struggles.

I asked him how he would like to be remembered by history. He replied that he hoped that he would be remembered as a man who did his duty to his country and his fellow man. He said that he had hoped to live long enough to see the fruits of his labor, a united and prosperous America, free from slavery and prejudice.

I thanked him for his time and told him that he had done more than anyone else to make America a better place. With a twinkle in his eye, he replied, "I did what I could, and that's all anyone can do."

In conclusion, my mission to interview historical figures at three significant points in their lives had been a great success. I had spoken to two of the most remarkable people in history and heard their stories. Despite their differences, both had a strong sense of purpose and a desire to do good in the world. It had been an honor to meet them and to witness firsthand the events that shaped their lives and legacies.
