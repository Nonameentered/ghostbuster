For as long as I could remember, music was always present. But not the kind that you could hear through headphones or a radio. It was something only I could hear, and it played to inform me on how to feel and warned me of upcoming events. It was like my very own personal soundtrack. Today, however, it took a strange turn.

I was walking down the street, listening to the soft and soothing lullaby that was playing in my head when suddenly, it cut out. The silence was disturbing. For some reason, I felt like something bad was about to happen, a warning. And then a new song came up, and it was not something I was familiar with.

It was an orchestral piece, grand and ominous. It began with a slow, foreboding beat, and then strings slowly crept to the melody. But then, the music escalated, and before I knew it, it was in full swing, alarming me.

I looked around, but there was no one in sight. Was I the only one who could hear this? I felt disoriented and confused, like I was suddenly in a different world. I tried to ignore the music and keep walking, but it was as if the sound was coming not from my mind, but from somewhere else. As if there was an orchestra playing this song just for me.

I continued through the park, trying to ignore the ominous tones playing in my head. The music had never been wrong before. It had warned me about forthcoming storms or anticipated moments of happiness. As much as I tried to convince myself that it was just my imagination, I knew better. The music was never wrong.

And then, it happened.

I saw a man, and he was coming straight towards me. From his expressions, I could tell he was angry. But the strange part was that he was carrying a sword! A sword! However, as soon as he drew closer, the music changed. The tense, ominous melody that filled my mind was replaced with a grand and epic orchestral piece. It was like the music was signaling something important.

'You must fight' it kept on repeating the same phrase.

Fight? Was this the warning my music was trying to tell me about? Was this the reason for the change in music?

The man with the sword was almost upon me, and the music had compelled me to fight. I braced myself for his attack, ready to defend myself, and then something strange happened. It was as if my body had taken over, and the movements were not under my control. I moved swiftness, tactfully dodging his attacks, and then before I knew it, I had disarmed him.

The man looked at me stunned, then ran away, leaving the sword on the ground. I had never been in a fight before, but somehow, it felt instinctive. I felt proud of myself, but then, my attention morphed back to the music.

'Something more significant is coming your way,' it whispered.

But what? What could be more important than this?

The music cut out once again, and I was left standing there bewildered. The encounter with the man with the sword had shaken me to the core. I was just an ordinary person, living an ordinary life, but the music had propelled me into something different. Something made me want to be more than just the average person.

I continued walking, still disturbed by what had happened. The music gradually came to a stop, and much to my relief, it was replaced by an upbeat and uplifting tune. I was filled with excitement! What good news could be waiting for me on the other side?

I entered my apartment, and my phone rang. It was my best friend. She told me she had won the lottery. I was beyond happy for her. She was someone who deserved all the happiness in the world and winning the lottery was a dream come true. Could this be the good news the music was trying to tell me?

I sat down on my bed, still in a daze. The music that only I could hear had played a role in my life for as long as I could remember, but now it had taken a new turn. It had become an omen of some sorts, warning me of impending danger or good fortune.

I didn't know what lay ahead, but the music had made me believe that anything was possible. It had given me the courage to face the unknown, to fight when needed and the confidence to embrace new blessings.

And it all started with my very own, personalized musical score - a score that only I could hear.
