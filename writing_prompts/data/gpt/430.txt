'When you can't look on the bright side, I will sit with you in the dark.'
Sophie was always the life of the party. She was bubbly, outgoing, and always had a light-hearted joke or two to tell. She was the most popular girl in high school and had a full scholarship to her dream college. However, things took an unexpected turn when Sophie's mom passed away from cancer. This loss had shaken Sophie to her core, and she was left feeling utterly lost. Sophie's friends didn't know how to help her, and they slowly backed away. They didn't know how to handle her sadness, and soon she was alone.

One day, Sophie received a text message from her childhood best friend, Alex. It read, "When you can't look on the bright side, I will sit with you in the dark." This was the first time in weeks that Sophie felt seen and heard.

Sophie replied, "I just feel so alone."

"I know. That's why I'm here. I'll be there tonight, and we can sit and watch a movie. Whatever you need."

Sophie's heart swelled with gratitude and a hint of hope. Maybe things would be okay after all.

She spent the rest of the day trying her best to force a smile, knowing Alex was right around the corner. When she arrived later that night, Sophie's apartment was dark, and Sophie sat in the center of the couch, with a blanket wrapped around her.

Alex walked inside, and Sophie's heart felt like it could breathe a little easier. They sat in silence for a while, and Alex knew not to push her too hard to talk. He then said, "Soph, this isn't how your mom would want you to remember her."

"I know," replied Sophie, her voice cracking.

"Just remember all those happy memories you two shared. She wouldn't want you to be sad all the time."

Alex staying with Sophie that night was just what she needed. They talked about everything from life to love to road trips, and Sophie hadn't laughed that hard in weeks. It felt good to be around someone who accepted her as she was and wasn't afraid to see her in the darkness of her grief.

After that night, Alex made it a habit of checking up on Sophie regularly. Even though they lived in different states and life got busy, they made it a point to call each other once a week. Sophie was still healing, but she was grateful for the little things.

She was fortunate to have found a friend who could sit with her in the dark and hold her when she fell apart. Alex had become her rock in rough times, and she realized that sometimes all you need is a little support to help carry you through.

Sophie learned in a world that was constantly trying to cultivate the perfect, the strongest action one can take is finding the courage to be vulnerable. Alex became her beacon of light, her support, and her friend. Allowing herself to be vulnerable and allowing Alex into her life was the best decision she'd made.
