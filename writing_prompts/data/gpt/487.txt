A bedtime story for adults
Once upon a time, there was a young girl who had a dream. She dreamt of a world where people lived together in harmony, where everyone was happy and healthy, and where there was no more suffering and pain.

The girl told her mother about her dream, and her mother smiled and said, "That's a beautiful dream, my dear. But it's not possible. There is always suffering and pain in the world, and people will never all agree on how to live together."

The girl was disappointed, but she didn't give up on her dream. She decided to learn more about the world and the people in it. She read books about history, philosophy, and psychology. She talked to people from different cultures and backgrounds.

One day, she met an old wise man who lived in a cave in the mountains. She asked him how she could make her dream come true.

The old man thought for a moment and then said, "My dear, your dream is not impossible. But it won't happen overnight, and it won't happen by force. You must inspire others to follow your lead, and show them the way."

The girl was determined to do just that. She went back to her village and started talking to her neighbors and friends. She told them about her dream and how they could help make it a reality.

Slowly but surely, more and more people joined her cause. They held rallies and events, they donated money and time, and they spread the word far and wide.

Years went by, and the girl grew up and became a woman. She had changed the lives of millions of people around the world. They lived in a world where there was less suffering and pain, and where people worked together to make life better for everyone.

The woman had fulfilled her dream, but she knew that there was still more work to be done. She would continue to inspire others and work towards a world where everyone could live in peace and harmony.

And as she closed her eyes, she knew that her dream would live on forever.
