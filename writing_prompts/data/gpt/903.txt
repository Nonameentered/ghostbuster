The worst predictions of global warming came true, and only the poles are now habitable. Something, however, survived at the equator, and is moving towards humanities last strongholds.
The world had been warned for decades. Scientists predicted the looming consequences of global warming and climate change. But we didn't listen. We carried on our daily lives, relying on non-renewable energy, mass-producing plastic, and clearing acres of forests for industrialization. It was only a matter of time before our planet retaliated.

The worst predictions of global warming came true. The seas rose, swallowing coastlines and whole countries, and the earth shook with ferocious storms. Fires raged, destroying entire cities, and famine swept through the remaining agricultural lands. Humanity did what it could to survive, but it was never enough.

Now, only the poles are habitable. Vast sheets of ice cover vast regions of the Earth's surface, providing shelter from the inescapable heat that prevails everywhere else. The once-barren Arctic and Antarctic regions, in particular, have become coveted, with crowded communities of people who've migrated there in search of a new home.

However, something survived at the equator. The raging heat neither scorched nor sizzled it. It was an unknown, but whatever it was, it was coming towards humanity's last strongholds. 

The first sign of the approaching was the shimmer in the air. All communications at the North Pole had been down for hours when people noticed the heat-haze rising over the horizon. The sky had turned hazy greyish, with a dull, ominous glow, like a smoldering ember in the dark. Everyone could feel the tension in the air.

A few days later, a massive swarm of what seemed like insects descended upon Greenland's coastal town. The locals fled as fast as they could, but the swarm caught up with them. The insects were unlike any that anyone had seen before. The swarm's thick veil glowed dark red, and the hummed at an intensity that could stun a human.

The swarm brought havoc upon the town as they lashed out at anything in their path. They stripped bare trees' barks, gnawed on the wooden homes, demolished cars, and littered the streets with debris. It was as if they were looking for something or someone.

Eventually, the swarm moved on. Far off in the distance, a line of dark, shadowy figures could be seen bumbling out of the haze. The locals had heard rumors of creatures found only in old, ancient texts - beasts with vast wings and hairless. Cackling sounds echoed across the icy wasteland.

The beasts were headed towards the North Pole, and there was nothing anyone could do to stop them.

Meanwhile, life at the South Pole continued relatively uninterrupted. The people worked together to build a sustainable living environment, but they knew it was only a matter of time before they too were under the threat. Everyone was on high alert, but they continued with hope, trying to keep a sense of normalcy in the face of their uncertain future.

Even though it was far away, news of the beastly swarm had trickled down to the South Pole. A few days later, another swarm was spotted approaching from the north. This one was different; it was massive and menacing, with the horizon disappearing behind its form.

Against all odds, the swarm could be fought back somewhat. The inhabitants had moved their homes underground, creating shelter to fend off the monstrosities. They worked together, building weapons and crafting tools, to defeat their enemy.

The swarm was pushed back, and it seemed like humanity may have had a new chance, but the beasts had a relentless determination. They were not like any natural creature, and there was something almost supernatural about their abilities.

The people knew their safe haven at the South Pole was not impenetrable. The beasts had tasted human flesh once, and it was only a matter of time until they returned.

With the approach of new dangers, people began to feel the weight of defeat. The poles, humanity's last strongholds, were not enough. The beasts at the equator seemed relentless, and it was only a matter of time until they arrived. They could not escape the fate of a world in disarray. The life they knew was gone forever.

As days turned into weeks, people huddled at the South Pole, wondering if they would last another year, or if they were destined to be the last humans on Earth. The beasts were out there, somewhere. The danger was real, and the future was uncertain.

They only had each other and the Earth they called home, and they would fight with every ounce of strength they had left. And maybe, just maybe, they could fight back against what felt like an inevitable conclusion.
