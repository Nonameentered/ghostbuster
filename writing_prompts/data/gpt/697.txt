A failing physics student accidentally discovers faster-than-light-speed travel, but his professor doesn â€™ t believe him.
John had always struggled with physics. Mathematics, chemistry and biology were all subjects he could pass with ease. But with physics, it was a different story altogether.

He had often been told by his teachers that if he does not pass physics with a decent grade, he would never make it to college. John, however, took these statements lightly, convinced that there was no need to worry as he could always find a way around things. Thus, without any effort on his part, John had somehow managed to make it to his senior year.

As he sat in class, the professor droned on about the theory of relativity, the speed of light and the possibilities of time travel. John found himself zoning out. Suddenly, something the professor said caught his attention.

"According to Einstein's theory of relativity, mass can never exceed the speed of light."

It wasn't the first time John had heard this statement. But as he thought about it, an idea popped into his head. John quickly scribbled something onto a sheet of paper, which he later tucked into his bag, forgetting about it as he walked out of class.

That night, John found himself once more staring at the sheet of paper, and for the first time, he realized the implications of the idea he had scribbled down. He had discovered a way to achieve faster-than-light travel!

His experiments in the lab proved his idea to be correct. However, as soon as he stepped out of the lab, he realized his mistake. It was one thing to have the idea of faster-than-light travel, but what was he going to do with it?

Once more, John sat down to think. The first thing he felt he had to do was share his discovery with his professor. After all, he had encouraged them to think outside the box and come up with new ideas. Surely this would impress him.

Unfortunately, when John poured out his ideas about faster-than-light travel to his physics professor, the man laughed in his face, telling him that it was impossible.

It was just a fluke, the professor insisted, that John had stumbled upon. 

John was devastated. He had been so hopeful in finally impressing his teacher, and receiving some validation for his work.

Nevertheless, John couldn't let his idea go. He knew that he needed to keep refining the concept until it was perfect. Over the next few weeks, he spent all his free time in the labs, working on his idea. Finally, after long days and sleepless nights, he had perfected it.

The next day, John presented his work to the professor. If he had been unable to convince him before, he was confident that this time he would succeed. But once again, the professor tore his work apart, criticizing and belittling him, telling him that there was no way that his idea could work.

John was shattered. For a moment, he felt like giving up on his work. But he knew that deep down, his idea was sound, and with enough work, he could make it a reality.

So John, disillusioned but determined, walked out of the classroom and into the world, determined to make his idea a reality.

As he started to work on his own, John realized that he had something even more profound than faster-than-light travel. He had discovered a sense of purpose. As he pushed himself and his limits, he realized that this was what he had been searching for all along.

Years passed, and John worked tirelessly on his project. Finally, after countless days and nights spent in the lab, he had the breakthrough he had been waiting for.

He had made faster-than-light travel a reality!

The world was stunned by the news of John's discovery. Scientists and researchers from all over the world flocked to meet the now-notorious physicist who had accomplished the unthinkable.

However, before all the accolades and awards, John knew he had one last assignment he needed to complete. He walked back to his old university and entered his professor's classroom once more.

With a smile on his face, John pulled out a piece of paper and placed it on his professor's desk. The professor looked at him expectantly, a condescending smile still playing on his lips.

"Remember this, Professor? This is the idea you said was impossible."

The man looked at the paper, then back up at John. For the first time, he saw the unwavering determination in his student's eyes.

John was no longer just a failing physics student. He was now the man who had discovered faster-than-light travel. And his professor, who had laughed him off in the past, was now humbled before him.

"You were right, John," he said, in a tone tinged with resignation. "It is possible."

John smiled. "Anything is possible, professor. Never forget that."

And with that, John left the classroom, satisfied, for the first time in a long time, in the knowledge that he had proven all his doubters wrong and achieved what was once deemed impossible.
