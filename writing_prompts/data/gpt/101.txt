The guardian angel was thoroughly surprised when a demon mauled the assailant.
As a guardian angel, Michael had seen his fair share of violence and conflict on the streets of New York City. His job was to watch over his assigned human, a young woman named Sarah, and protect her from harm. It was a daunting task, but one that he took very seriously. He was always on high alert, ready to swoop in and shield her from any danger.

One night, as Sarah was walking home from work, Michael sensed an oncoming threat. He scanned the area, looking for any signs of danger, but everything appeared quiet. Suddenly, he felt it. The sharp sting of malevolent energy, coming from behind. Whipping around, Michael saw a tall figure coming toward them, bearing down on Sarah with a frightening velocity. He instinctively flew in front of her, creating a protective barrier with his wings.

The figure proved to be a man, wearing a hooded cloak and brandishing a serrated blade. He snarled at Michael, revealing a set of jagged teeth, and lunged forward. Michael drew his own sword in response, ready to defend his charge. The two clashed, sparks flying in all directions. Michael felt his essence being eroded by the sheer strength of his opponent’s dark magic. This was no ordinary human.

Just as Michael was about to be overpowered, he saw something that made him freeze in shock. A demon had come out of nowhere and was attacking the assailant. This was unexpected and rare. Demons usually work against the angels. But here, a demon had come for his protection.

The assailant recoiled from the otherworldly creature, giving Michael the chance to strike him with his sword. The man quickly regrouped, his cloak whipping behind him as he charged at Michael again. Dodging aside, Michael saw an opportunity and lunged at the assailant’s back. The blade sank into his shoulder and he howled in fury.

The demon was a blur of motion, darting in and out of the fray, and causing all sorts of chaos. Its hair was matted with blood, and its eyes glowed with a fierce intensity. Michael had never seen anything like it. He had heard the rumors, of course, but it was rare for a demon to interfere in angelic business.

Together, Michael and the demon fought side by side, their wings beating in perfect unison. They managed to drive the assailant back, forcing him to retreat. Michael was panting heavily, barely able to stand. The wound on his side was seeping blood, and he felt his strength ebbing away.

The demon, seeing that the danger had passed, gave him a nod, and then faded back into the shadows. Michael watched as it disappeared, feeling perplexed and bewildered. What was the meaning of all this? He had never before seen such a thing.

As he took stock of the situation, he noticed that Sarah had fainted. He quickly gathered her up in his arms and flew her to safety. Once back at her apartment, he settled her on the couch and watched over her while she slept. His thoughts were a jumbled mess.

Several hours later, Sarah awoke, calling out his name. She looked up and saw him standing there, looking down at her with concern on his face. She sat up and asked him what had happened, her eyes wide with fear. Michael tried to reassure her, but his own uncertainty was starting to get the better of him.

Days passed, and he couldn't shake the experience from his mind. He had always thought that demons and angels were on opposite sides of the coin, incapable of helping each other. But this event made him think otherwise. He delved deep into the annals of angelic lore, seeking an answer to the riddle that was consuming him.

Finally, he found an old tome that spoke of ancient times, when both angels and demons were created to serve the same purpose. They were meant to balance each other out, to keep each other in check. But over time, they had become mortal enemies, each seeking to destroy the other.

This was a story that Michael had never heard before, but its resonance was inescapable. He knew that he had witnessed something extraordinary, something that went against everything he had ever been taught. It was a glimmer of hope in a dark and dangerous world.

As he resumed his duties as Sarah's guardian angel, Michael couldn't help but feel grateful for the demon that had come to their aid. Its actions had gone against everything he had ever known, but he was beginning to realize that sometimes, the greatest surprises could come from the most unexpected places.
