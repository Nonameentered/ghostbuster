As a genie, I’ve helped countless masters fulfill their heart’s desires. I’m a servant, and I try to grant every wish my master makes. However, my latest master simply does not put much thought into the way he phrases his desires. His casual nature of ordering me around hinders my ability to give him the best possible experience. His lack of thought and care towards me is disrespectful. I decided to teach him a lesson.

It all started when my new master, Jack, rubbed the lamp and released me, expecting the usual drill. His first request was for a sandwich, which I quickly granted. The sandwich wasn’t perfect though. It was too spicy for his liking. He complained and gave me the impression that it was my fault. The second wish was for me to clean his room. What he forgot to mention was that one of his prized possessions was hidden under his bed. It shattered as I sucked it up during the routine cleaning. Again, he blamed me for his mistake of not being clear. 

As the days went on, Jack made more and more thoughtless requests. He would never say, "please" or even show gratitude for my work. It annoyed me to see him disregard the effort I put into ensuring his requests were met. After months of this careless behavior, I’d had enough. I decided to teach him a lesson.

I waited for him to call me out for his next wish, but I didn’t appear. Instead, I observed him from a distance. Jack was getting restless, so I decided to reveal myself. He looked at me with disdain and said, "Finally! You’re here. I thought you were fired or something."

I decided to grant Jack's wish but with a twist. "You're going to be transformed into a genie, Jack," I said. His expression changed when he heard that. He didn't think it would be something like this. I flashed my fingers, and a puff of smoke surrounded him. When it cleared, Jack was floating in mid-air with blue skin and turban. I smiled as I saw the terror in his eyes. 

"Genie, here are your instructions. You’ll grant three wishes. And after your third wish, the cycle will repeat. You’ll be trapped in the lamp until the next master rubs it, and then, the process will repeat. Have fun." I uttered and went back into the lamp with the fuming Jack left on his own.

Days turned into months, and Jack was tired of his tenacious predicament. He realized that he had been a terrible master to me. He spent all three wishes on freeing himself, but I never changed the cycle. By the end of his third wish, Jack turned back into a petty human, trapped in the lamp, trying to think about his carelessness while waiting to be released by his next master.

Moral of the story? Be cautious of how you treat people, even if they are inanimate objects. As karma always has a way of coming back.
