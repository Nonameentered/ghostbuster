I had been planning this mission for weeks. I knew the house I was about to raid like the back of my hand. I had studied its layout, timed the patterns of its inhabitants, and anticipated their every move. And now, finally, I was inside.

But as I crept through the darkened hallway towards the master bedroom, a nagging thought kept pulling at the back of my mind. The floors had just been mopped. And as someone who had been in the business of breaking and entering for years, I knew full well how much an unexpected footprint could tip off even the most clueless of homeowners.

I made a tentative step forward, testing to see whether the floor was still slick with cleaner. It was. My stomach churned with fleeting guilt and I paused for a moment, considering my options. I could easily chicken out now, cut my losses and run. Or I could be extra careful, take my time, and make sure I left no trace of my presence behind.

I chose the latter option. After all, I had already come this far. I wasn't about to be defeated by a bit of sneaky floor juice.

I took off my shoes and carefully slipped them into my backpack, then continued down the hallway in my socks. I would have to be extra careful now in case of creaky floorboards, but I was confident in my abilities. Years of practice had taught me how to move silently and efficiently.

The master bedroom was the jackpot. It was where the safe was kept. I knew exactly where it was, hidden behind a painting of an ugly-looking cat that hung on the wall. I approached it carefully, tiptoeing as quietly as I could. The floor was so slippery I felt like I was ice-skating. I could feel my toes curling, trying to gain purchase on the slick surface.

When I reached the safe, I took out my lock-picking tools and got to work. The tumblers clicked satisfyingly and I began to feel the rush of adrenaline that came with success. But then I heard a noise. Footsteps, coming down the hallway.

My heart pounded as I quickly shut the safe and turned away from it, ready to make my escape. But it was too late. Before I could react, the bedroom door burst open and a figure strode through.

It was a woman. A middle-aged woman with a bathrobe on and a mop in her hand. She looked directly at me, a mix of confusion and anger etched on her face.

"What are you doing here?" she demanded, her voice rising in pitch as she took a step closer. She lifted the mop threateningly, as if she were about to use it as a weapon.

I hesitated for a moment, my mind racing with potential escape routes and the need to not leave any marks on her clean floors. But then I saw something in her face, a flicker of recognition. And a realization washed over me. This was not the homeowner. This was a cleaning lady, a late-night janitor who had slipped into the house to do her job.

I looked around the room, noted the lack of personal belongings, and realized she was right. This wasn't the jackpot. I had come to the wrong house. I had broken in, evaded security and the mopping of the floors only to steal nothing, and most likely all for nothing.

I swallowed hard, a little embarrassed and very relieved. She must have seen the genuine confusion on my face, because she lowered her mop and some of the anger drained from her gaze.

"You're not supposed to be here, you know," she said, her tone less accusatory. "You really should leave."

I nodded, slowly backing towards the window. This adventure was turning out to be a real failure. But I took pride in knowing I'd still managed to carry out the mission unobtrusively. After all, I might have been a burglar, but I wasn't a vandal.

With one last glance at the cleaning lady, I lifted my backpack and jumped out of the window, determined to get back to my own (correct) house before the night was through. But I couldn't resist one last glance at the window I'd just fled from, now highlighted in the moon's glow.

As it turned out, that ugly cat painting was worth more than I first thought.
