'before we allow the human race to join us in the stars, tell us the faults of your kind.'
The alien council sat in a circle, their glowing eyes fixed on me. I stood in front of them, a mere human, ready to defend my entire race.

"Before we allow the human race to join you in the stars, tell us the faults of your kind," one of them said.

I took a deep breath before speaking.

"Please forgive us for our greed. Our hunger for power has led us to polluting our planet, destroying habitats, and hunting animals to extinction. We have ravaged the earth in the name of progress, without considering the consequences," I said.

The aliens stared at me, their expressions unreadable.

"Furthermore, we have a tendency to discriminate against our own kind. Our inability to embrace diversity has led to wars, genocides, and atrocities committed against one another," I continued.

The council nodded in agreement.

"But, please do not judge us harshly. We are also capable of empathy, kindness, and love. We are a flawed race, but we are trying to do better. We hope to learn from more advanced civilizations like yours and make amends for our mistakes," I said, hoping they would hear my sincerity.

The aliens looked at one another, then one of them spoke.

"Very well. We will consider your request to join us in the stars. But know this, human. The journey will not be easy. You must be willing to change, and to learn from us," they said.

I bowed my head, grateful for the opportunity, but also aware of the great responsibility that lay ahead.
