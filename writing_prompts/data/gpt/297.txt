I had always cared for Janet, even though we were never particularly close. We had met in high school, shared a few classes together, and occasionally ran into each other around town. But even though we were never close friends, I always knew that Janet was special.

So when I heard the news that she had been diagnosed with cancer, my heart sank. I wanted to reach out to her, offer her support, help in any way I could. But the truth was that I had minimal presence in her life. We hadn't spoken in months, and I knew that it would be inappropriate to suddenly insert myself into her struggle.

I did what I could from afar, sending her a message offering love and encouragement, donating to her GoFundMe to help cover her medical expenses. But all the while, I felt a sense of helplessness. I wished that I could do more for her, that I could be there in person to offer a shoulder to cry on or a hand to hold.

As the months passed, I kept tabs on Janet's progress through social media. I saw the triumphant posts when she finished her chemotherapy, the grateful notes thanking her supporters, and the hopeful updates about her health.

In the end, I may not have been a major presence in Janet's life, but I was happy to be a part of her journey. And even though I couldn't get actively involved in her battle against cancer, I will always care about her â€“ no matter what.
