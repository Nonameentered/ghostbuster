Some people collect stamps. Others, coins. You collect something far stranger.
Ever since I was a child, I had a strange fascination with abandoned teeth. It started when I found a milk tooth on the ground and kept it as a treasure. The thrill of finding one continued to grow and I started actively looking for them. It's ironic how something that has been thrown away can hold such value.

My collection includes teeth of all shapes and sizes, from the tiny milk teeth to the big molars. I have them sorted according to size, color, and condition. Some of them have root canals, while others have cavities or are perfectly intact. My favorites are the ones that are stained yellow with age, and I've even managed to collect a few from dead animals.

My friends and family can't wrap their heads around my obsession. Some even find it creepy, but to me, they are beautiful. Each tooth has a unique story to tell, and with it, I can imagine the journey it has been on.

It's been years since I started my collection, and I can't even fathom the thought of stopping. My home is like a museum, with tooth displays and storage boxes taking up most of the space. I don't expect people to understand my odd hobby, but to me, it brings a sense of peace and satisfaction.
