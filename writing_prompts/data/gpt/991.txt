Describe what's left.
The sun was setting over the horizon, casting a warm amber glow over the deserted landscape. A lone figure trudged across the barren wasteland, their eyes glazed over as they surveyed the destruction that had been wrought upon the land.

The only sound was the crunching of their footsteps on the dusty ground, a stark contrast to the once bustling city that had been reduced to rubble. It was hard to believe that just a year ago, this had been a thriving metropolis filled with people, cars, and skyscrapers that reached towards the sky.

Now, only remnants of the past remained. Crumbled buildings, twisted metal, and the occasional charred remains of a car littered the streets. The air was thick with the scent of smoke, and it was hard to breathe without wheezing. The beauty of the once vibrant city had faded away, and it was clear that there was no going back to what it once was.

The figure continued their trek, their eyes never leaving the devastation that surrounded them. Some part of them had hoped that maybe their city would be spared the fate that had befallen so many other places before it, but that dream had been shattered when the bombs began to fall from the sky.

As they walked, memories flooded back of the life they had once known, the people they had loved, the happiness they had felt. But now, it was all gone, replaced by the harsh reality of destruction and despair.

In the distance, the figure saw a flicker of movement, and their heart leaped with hope. Maybe there were survivors, maybe there was still a chance to rebuild what had been lost. They began to run towards the flicker of movement, fueled by determination and a sense of purpose.

As they drew closer, though, their hopes were dashed once again. The movement had been nothing more than a breeze blowing through the empty streets, a reminder of the desolation that had overtaken the world.

The figure stopped in their tracks, taking in the emptiness that surrounded them. What was left was a shell of what had once been, a stark reminder of the fragility of life, and a warning of what could happen if humanity lost sight of what was truly important.

They stood there for a moment longer, taking in the sight before them, before turning and walking away. It was time to move on, to try and find a new way of life amidst the rubble. One thing was for sure, though - they would never forget what was left.
