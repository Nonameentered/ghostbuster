You and your crew have been sent to start colonizing the moon. When you visit the far side you find signs that this isn â€™ t the first time humans have tried to colonize it, and it looks like things ended badly for them.
As the crew prepared to land on the far side of the moon, we found ourselves filled with excitement and anticipation. Our mission was to start colonizing the moon, to pave the way for future generations to explore and settle on this mysterious terrain. But as we began to survey the area, we found signs that suggested we were not the first to attempt such a feat.

There were structures that appeared to be abandoned, and signs of what looked like a conflict. We searched for signs of life, but all we found were remnants of equipment left behind. Our crew speculated that the previous colonization attempt had ended in disaster, but we couldn't determine what had gone wrong.

As we continued our work, we couldn't shake off the eerie feeling that we were not alone. We were determined to succeed where others had failed, but we knew that the risks were high. As we left the far side behind, we knew that we could only hope for the best and be prepared for the worst.
