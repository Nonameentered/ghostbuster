It was the last video on Earth. The one last thing that represented the human race- hope, love, and despair all captured in a single video. It wasn't made by the most influential people but by a lad who wanted to show the world his skills. 

The video began to play on every screen scattered across the world; it showed moments of humanity's finest moments. People hugging their neighbors, giving a handshake to a stranger, and people dancing with joy. It was like watching memories come alive. Yet, tears that were once held back began to trickle down people's faces. 

The video was a reminder of what humanity was, a reminder of what they should be. And as it concluded, people realized that they were capable of love, kindness, and empathy- they just needed to act. The last video on Earth was a powerful message to remind the people of their potential - it was not the end but the beginning of a new chapter.
