You are at the park with your kids, when you see the telltale signs of a lightning strike. You divert your kids from danger, but are hit by lightning. Soon after, you discover that your Dad Senses have increased 100 fold.
I was at the park with my kids, enjoying a lovely afternoon picnic. The sky was a beautiful shade of blue, and soft clouds drifted lazily by. Suddenly, I saw a flash of lightning in the distance, and felt the hair on my arms stand up. I knew we had to get out of there fast.

I quickly grabbed my kids and told them to start packing up our stuff. I looked around and saw that people were starting to leave the park, too. That was when I felt a sharp pain hit me. I was hit by lightning. Thankfully, I had already moved my kids and was standing alone.

It was a terrifying experience, but as I started to regain my senses, I noticed something strange. My Dad Senses had been amplified 100-fold. I could see things that I never could before. I could sense when things were about to go wrong, and could react a lot faster than before.

My senses were heightened all the time. I would hear noises that I never noticed before. I could tell when my kids needed something even before they asked. I felt like a superhero, always one step ahead of everyone else.

People began to notice that something was different about me. They would come up and ask if I was okay, and I would just laugh and say that I was doing better than ever. My Dad Senses had never been stronger.

It wasn't long before my friends started to ask me for advice. They would come to me with their problems, and I would always know the right thing to say. My family started to rely on me more and more, and I loved having this feeling of control.

In the end, I realized that being hit by lightning was a blessing in disguise. I had superpowers now, and nothing could stop me.
