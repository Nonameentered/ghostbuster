after recently discovering their powers, a superhero must deal with being bored and frustrated because their amazing powers are useless compared to modern technology and law enforcement.
As a kid, Alex had always dreamt of being a superhero, with incredible powers beyond imagination. Now an adult, Alex had finally discovered that they did, in fact, possess such abilities. But as days turned into weeks and weeks turned into months, the excitement began to fade. Alex was bored and frustrated with their seemingly useless powers.

Gone were the days of villains terrorizing the city with no one to stop them. Now, modern technology had made law enforcement far more effective at preventing crime. Alex tried to use their powers to help when possible but quickly realized it wasn't much help at all.

When Alex turned on the news, they found that their powers were no match for surveillance cameras, drones, and sophisticated tracking systems. As much as Alex wanted to make a difference, the odds were stacked against them.

As the days went by, Alex began to understand that while their powers may not be as useful as modern technology, they still had value. They could help people in small ways that no one else could. Power may not always be measured by physical strength or technological advancement. Any contribution, no matter how small, can make a difference in someone's life, and that's what truly makes a superhero.
