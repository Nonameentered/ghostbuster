One day your breakfast is interrupted by the sudden opening of a wormhole which spits out someone wearing strange clothing. It becomes apparent to you that they are from a period long in the past. Now you're stuck trying to help them make sense of the modern world.
I was sitting at my kitchen table, munching on a bowl of Cheerios, when suddenly a bright light filled the room. Dazed and confused, I saw a figure stumble out of what appeared to be a wormhole. As they got closer, I realized that they were wearing strange clothing, unlike anything I had ever seen before.

The person appeared to be in a state of complete shock, their eyes darting around the room as if searching for something specific. As I approached, the person started to speak, but their words were gibberish, almost unrecognizable as a language.

After a few moments, it became apparent to me that this person was from a period long in the past, an era that had long since passed from the memory of the modern world. I didn't know what to do, but I knew that I had to help him make sense of the modern world.

Perhaps sensing my confusion, the person began to calm down, and I slowly began to piece together the bits of knowledge that he seemed to know. They were surprised to see how much technology had advanced, with phones, computers, and all sorts of gadgets that they had never seen before.

We spent the whole day together, exploring the city and trying to understand this brave new world. The person was fascinated by everything they saw, from cars driving on the streets to the skyscrapers that towered above their heads.

As the day drew to a close, I began to realize that I had grown quite fond of my new friend. They were so curious and energetic, and I could see how much they had to offer the world. I knew that they still had a lot to learn, but I was happy to be there for them, to be a guide and a partner in their journey of discovery.

The next morning, the person vanished as suddenly as they had appeared, leaving behind only a lifetime of memories and a sense of awe and wonder that would stay with me for the rest of my days.
