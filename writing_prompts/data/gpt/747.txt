I was born and raised in a village of fierce barbarians. From a young age, I was fascinated by the art of war and the thrill of battle. I was trained to wield a battle-axe and hunt wild beasts. I was taught to never show mercy to my enemies and to always carry out my duty to the tribe.

But as fate would have it, I ended up working for a multinational corporation in their accounting department. At first, I was reluctant to trade my battle-axe for a pen and paper, but I soon realized that the work I did was just as important as any battle I had fought.

As an accountant, I was responsible for keeping track of the company's finances. I would review reports, balance budgets and make sure that the company was running efficiently. I found myself getting lost in the numbers and charts, and soon forgot about my barbaric ways.

One day, while I was working late at the office, a group of armed robbers stormed in. They held everyone hostage and demanded that we hand over the company's cash reserves. I knew what I had to do. I picked up a nearby battle-axe and charged at the robbers.

Despite being outnumbered and outgunned, I fought with all my might. My battle-axe was a blur as I swung it at the robbers. I didn't care about the blood or the pain. All I cared about was protecting my company.

In the end, I emerged victorious. The robbers were either dead or fleeing, and I was covered in blood. My colleagues looked at me in shock, but I didn't care. I knew that I was still a bloodthirsty barbarian at heart, but I also knew that I had found a new purpose in life.

From that day on, I continued to work at the accounting department, but I also kept my battle-axe close by. I never knew when I might need it again.
