It was the year 3056 and mankind had long since forgotten the cataclysmic event that had destroyed Earth over a thousand years ago. Those who survived did so only because they were able to find a way to leave the doomed planet behind. They eventually ended up colonizing two different planets, each group believing themselves to be the sole survivors of their species. They lived out their lives on their new homes, never knowing that the other group existed.

The first group, let's call them the Aresians, had found their way to a planet they named Ares. It was a relatively hospitable planet with an abundance of resources that allowed them to thrive. They built massive cities and created a new civilization that was nothing like the one they had left behind. They had technology beyond their wildest dreams and had even developed a way to prolong human life far beyond what was ever possible on Earth. Eventually, their society became stagnant and complacent, and they began to turn their focus inward, never once considering the possibility of other survivors.

The second group, the Arcadians, had landed on a planet they named Arcadia. They had a much more difficult time than the Aresians, grappling with harsh terrain and limited resources. But they persevered, building a society that was rugged and resilient. They had developed unique technologies that allowed them to thrive in this new environment, and although their technology was not as advanced as that of the Aresians, they had developed new and innovative ways to survive.

As time went on, the memory of Earth and the civilization that once inhabited it began to fade from the minds of both groups. They lived their lives contentedly, never once thinking that there could be other humans out there.

That was until one day, a group of Arcadians discovered a strange object in the sky. It was a massive spacecraft that had landed on the outskirts of their territory. The Arcadians were terrified. They had never seen anything like it before. It was only when they began to investigate the ship that they realized it was not from their planet. It had the markings of the Aresians.

Meanwhile, on Ares, a similar discovery had been made. A team of explorers had stumbled upon an ancient archive that had been sealed off for generations. As they dug through the records and old data, they made a startling discovery. They were not alone in the universe. Another group of humans had survived and established their own colony on a planet called Arcadia.

Both groups were shocked. It was impossible that there were survivors they had not known about. They hastily made arrangements to send out expeditions that would establish contact between the two groups. It was an exciting time, but it was also a time of great concern. They had lived such different lives for so long that they were not entirely sure how they would interact with one another.

The first contact was not as smooth as they had hoped. There was a lot of suspicion and mistrust. The Aresians had developed a society that had long since forgotten what it was to struggle. They had grown complacent with their wealth of resources and now looked upon the Arcadians with pity. The Arcadians, on the other hand, were a hardy and resilient people, but they had long since forgotten what it was to enjoy the fruits of life. They were so focused on survival that they had little to no concept of what a true civilization could look like.

Despite the challenges they faced, the two groups slowly began to build a relationship. They shared their knowledge and capabilities, and soon they were developing new ways to explore their galaxy. While they were still very different from one another, they became partners in their shared struggle for survival.

In the years that followed, the two groups became somewhat of a legend in the galaxy. Their extraordinary journey from the ruins of Earth to the far reaches of their shared universe inspired countless others to explore, to survive and to thrive. They had both undergone an incredible transformation, and their story would be told for generations to come.

It was a journey that had taken them from the brink of extinction, to the forefront of their shared universe. They had come full circle, from the desolation of Earth to the stars beyond. It was a journey that had taken them over a thousand years but had, in the end, brought them the discovery of a shared destiny.
