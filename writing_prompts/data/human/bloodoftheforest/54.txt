It took me five days to work out that Suzie wasn't human and honestly even that's a testament to my idiocy. Normal coworkers don't stare blankly at their screen without even bothering to move their hands for 90% of their day. Normal coworkers don't leave a puddle of violet tinted water anywhere they touch that disappears about ten seconds later. Normal coworkers don't not only know about the 'spell' from a weird little website that you cast in your teenaged years but also bring it up several times a day.

I don't know why Suzie waited such a long time between my weird little phase of believing that I had some kind of special, innate power by accessing the secret knowledge provided on badly made website and now. My best guess is that time doesn't work the same way for her as it does for the rest of us. Nothing about the process really seems difficult for her - granted, her human form is a bit lacking but that seems to be a lack of understanding rather than the effort it would take to be perfect. When I mentioned the ticking sound she makes when she walks that little quirk went away instantly.

The oddest thing about Suzie in many ways her her insistence that she's a perfectly normal human. When I mentioned the ticking she just laughed at me and her eyes did something that I literally can't describe in words before silently scuttling away. When I asked how exactly she knew that I cast a spell to an eldritch being she froze for a moment, then yelled "oh no! The printer!" and rushed off towards the vending machine.

She knows the words for every item in our office but she doesn't necessarily attach them to the right things. Moreover, she doesn't seem to think it's important that objects are referred to by the same word all of the time - she sees literally no issue with calling her computer a computer one day but a printout the next.

The way our office is laid out has us each sharing a large desk with a coworker, the computers on opposite sides. Suzie shares my desk, of course. This is somewhat concerning as I am ninety percent sure I used to have a different coworker. I don't remember anything about them but whenever I try to recall any detail I feel an absence in my mind, like a tongue poking the hole where a tooth once lived.

The most concerning thing about my encounters with Suzie is that she wants to be friends. She first asked to hang out with me shortly after I'd figured out what she was (well, as much as I'll ever be able to) and so I didn't really feel I could say no. She asked to hang out after work and I assumed she meant grab a drink directly after our shift. Instead, the workday ended and Suzie was nowhere to be found. My evening was uneventful but my dreams were filled with a glittering city that made even my dream-self's eyes quietly bleed. I was followed by a creature that I couldn't see who whispered things that made my skin shiver and tingle even as it morphed into new and terrifying shapes.

I didn't entirely hate that dream, to be honest. But my point still stands that it doesn't fit the normal description of 'hanging out.'

Where do you even go from that? How do you tell your eldritch friend who insists they are human that visions of another plane of existence aren't a normal way of hanging out with coworkers?

I went for feigning ignorance. When Suzie asked if I'd enjoyed my night I said I must have just missed her or something as she left work and it's a shame we didn't get to hang out. She looked guilty, I think she's getting the hang of human faces. Her eyes did do that indescribable thing again, though.

That night at home I was greeted by a beautifully wrapped box with the word 'sorry' scratched onto the label. Against my better judgement (which is rarely around anyway, if I'm being honest) I opened my gift up and was treated to a box of shifting, sparkling shadows.

*Nope.*

I haven't thrown the box away because it feels like that might have unintended consequences so I've just popped it in the cupboard under the sink. Out of sight, out of mind.

It was clear I was going to have to take a proactive approach to dealing with Suzie so I invited her out to drinks myself - giving very clear instructions on the when and the where. I was optimistic that I could pepper in some human lessons in our hanging out and at the very least it might delay the next insanely weird thing for another week or two.

The thing is, I don't even dislike Suzie. I'm terrified of her, naturally, but I don't think that has to be a massive dealbreaker in a friendship. She mostly just seems to want me to like her and she respects my boundaries once she understands them. Conversations with her are bizarre but interesting and as long as I'm not dumb enough to seek too much knowledge I could probably learn some interesting things from her.

I ordered both of our drinks as this wasn't an interaction Suzie had done before. After about an hour she started to relax (not visibly, her body was still as stiff as a puppet, but the conversation had managed to shift away from how human she was toward other topics) and I was having a pretty good time myself. I'm not totally sure what it says about me that I was enjoying myself in a bar with an eldritch monstrosity but I've had worse company.

Enter worse company.

Worse company's name is Gabe, he has been trying to date me for seven months and unlike Suzie he displays no respect for boundaries. He works at our company so I can't entirely avoid him and whilst he wants my to like him I'm struggling to think of a single likeable trait he actually has. Gabe approached our table whilst Suzie was getting drinks from the bar (new human skill achieved!) and sat uncomfortably close to me. He started asking me why I'd never accepted his offer of a date in this bar and had already manoeuvred the conversation to the awesome new lighting fixture he could show me if I went back to his place when Suzie returned.

"Oh," Gabe said with an obvious tone of disappointment, "I thought you were here alone."

"I'm Callie's friend." Suzie offered brightly, which I guess was actually true.

"I'd really hoped to talk to Callie alone, do you-" Gabe began but I cut him off.

"Oh, you guys haven't met! I have to nip to the bathroom, Suzie - you should tell Gabe about yourself. Everything about yourself."

It's two months later and I still don't know exactly what Suzie said to Gabe but not only was he pale as milk when I returned that night, he hasn't once bothered me since. I don't know if Suzie managed to pick up on my 'help me' vibes or if it was inevitable that she'd have said something disturbing to him either way. She still insists that she's still perfectly normal and whilst I hope she'll open up to me one day I'm fine trying to sneak human lessons upon her until we reach that point.

After all, I owe her a favour now. And more than that, she's my friend.
