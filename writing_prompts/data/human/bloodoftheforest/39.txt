I'd heard this story fifteen times already and if my grandad had been telling me a few years ago or even just a single year ago, I'd have been zoning out. But you'd be surprised how different the exact same tales sound when the person telling them is on their deathbed instead of settled in a comfy chair.

"...but the real treasure was the friends we made along the way." he finished.

That was the way he ended every story recounting his previous adventures. As a child I'd believed him totally, having no doubts that he regarded his friends as being just as worthwhile as any riches. As a teenager, I became cynical. If my grandad loved his adventuring friends so dearly, why had I never seen them? I could believe that one or two were two busy or perhaps had even perished, but that not a single one cared enough about him to come visit seemed unlikely if his stories were all actually true. His adventures had reportedly caused him to travel far and wide so it wasn't though I could verify his claims in any way with anybody that I knew either.

As an adult, I decided it didn't matter very much. If he'd embellished here and there then that wasn't such a crime. And this past year I'd decided it didn't matter at all, not even slightly.

"I wish I could have met them," I told him, "they sound incredible."

"They were," My grandfather said nostalgically, "but they were my friends, not yours."

I didn't quite understand the statement but occasionally he'd say things that didn't make sense. It didn't same fair to push it. My grandfather had been a successful adventurer because of his skills as a highly intelligent spell caster so drawing attention to the fact that his greatest asset had declined seemed unfair, cruel almost.

"Did I tell you about the archer?" He asked me, but he sounded tired and weak.

"Yes, many times." I replied fondly as I pulled the quilt up around his throat. "Her name was Diana and you went on many adventures together. But for now, you should get some sleep."

"She'll be your friend one day." He mumbled in his exhaustion but I doubted that a woman who had not called around to my grandfather's house even once would suddenly see the need to call around to visit the man's granddaughter.
