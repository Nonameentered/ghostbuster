In my mind this necromancer is a polite and well mannered individual who simply happens to have unusual skills. That being said, I am quite sure that not only could the gift of life be reversed but also that the patient/victim/recipient is still technically bound to the necromancer if they ever decided to issue further orders. Not that they would, of course. But they could.
