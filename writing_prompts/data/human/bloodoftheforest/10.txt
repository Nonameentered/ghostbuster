"No." I said.

There was a pause.

"Would you mind picking it up for me? I'm afraid I've hurt my back and-"

"I said no." I replied. "Do you really think this is the first time this has happened to me?"

The second pause was much longer. The man couldn't bear to leave his book on the floor and grabbed it swiftly with no evidence of the back problems he'd just hinted at. I nodded at him.

"Right. There's a cafe over there," I said, gesturing across the road, "I think you and I should have a little chat."

"Well, I don't really think that's necessary, I'm sorry for-" the man blustered but I cut him off again.

"I've told you that this isn't the first time someone's tried this trick on me but I know it's the first time you've tried it. Even if you work for someone else I doubt they'd be dumb enough to recommend the same plan twice. So there are other people out there with mysterious tomes that they are just desperate for me to touch and you're honestly telling me that you're not just as interested in finding out about that as I am in finding out whatever it is you think you're doing?"

His eyes widened and he nodded slowly.

"Great." I responded. "You're buying."

A few minutes later I was sat next to the window slurping the fanciest Frappuccino that the cafe had to offer. I *hated* it but it was the most expensive thing on the menu and I'll be damned if this man was going to get away with only paying for my default order of a small black coffee.

"The book lives in your bag." I said, glaring at it pointedly. "You're going to put it away in such a way that it remains completely covered for this entire conversation. Think of it like your penis - if it becomes visible or touches me without my consent then our polite chat will be over and we'll instead be having a very different kind of interaction. Now. Seriously."

He seemed flustered (at my attitude or at the word 'penis?' Who knows?) but he complied thoroughly and quickly. He seemed incredibly nervous and I wondered how much information he really had.

"My name's Edward." He offered.

"Didn't ask and you already know that mine's Alice."

He looked mildly hurt that I'd rebuffed his peace offering which solidified the idea that he didn't have much to tell me.

"Who do you work for?" I asked but he shook his head.

"I can't tell you that. Maybe there's something minor I could tell you but something like that wouldn't be allowed. Who else is trying to get you to help them?"

I laughed hollowly at that.

"Help? That implies I have some sort of choice. I wasn't lying when I said that this exact situation had already happened before. Where's my choice in this, huh?"

"What would it have done? Would it have hurt you? I didn't want to hurt anybody..."

He trailed off and I stared at him in stunned silence.

"Edward... how much did they tell you about me?"

"They didn't tell me anything about you-"

*No no no no...*

"I didn't even know your name was Alice. This was my initiation."

I'm usually more prone to talking than is good for me but at this revelation all I could do was sit there and let the taste of too many syrups fester on my tongue. I was barely even aware that Edward was still talking.

"I was just supposed to drop the book in front of you when you left work and then return to the base to return the book when I'd done it. I assumed it was probably just to see if I could be trusted with a book of this value, I've only been trusted with less important magical tomes before now. What *can* you do?"

"I absorb the information from any book I touch."

"Oh. But then what was the point of all of this? Why would they just give you information that they can't fully understand?"

*Oh fuck...*

"Because they intend to abduct me." I realised. "They knew where and when I worked in order to have you bump into me but to abduct someone in broad daylight would be tricky so they're probably waiting where I live. Once they realise I'm delayed they'll come for me."

"No, they wouldn't!" Edward said but more in a panic than believing it.

I should have started running but instead I felt sick. Where would I even go?

"Come on," Edward said urgently "we have to leave."

He was standing. Did I miss him standing up?

"Please, come with me."

"Where are you taking me?"

"To where I'm staying. They know where you live and they might well know where I live but I don't think they know I've been staying with my friend Pete for the past week due to water issues in my building."

I shook my head.

"How would I even know if I can trust you?"

Edward thought about it and then grabbed the remains of my disgusting drink.

"Because I will destroy this tome if you want me to. If it will mean you trust me then you can watch from a safe distance whilst I pour a little of this on every single page. Or tear it up, or burn it if anyone has a lighter or, I don't know! But please choose quickly. I didn't mean to be a part of this and if I've really put you in the danger you're describing then I think we'll need to leave soon."

I thought about it and then stood up.

"No, keep the book. It's sort of our only hostage."

Edward passed me the bag.

"Then you should have it. Just in case."

He lead me out of the cafe, talking far too fast and describing every step of the incredibly short journey we were about to take.

"Wouldn't it be smarter to just flee than go see Pete?" I asked. "It sounds like he doesn't even live outside of the city."

"He doesn't. But when I said I'd been trusted with minor magical books I mean that I still have them. And since I didn't want to leave them for days they are currently living in Pete's home office. So I figure you should maybe touch them. They're only basic stuff but if you'd know the whole book instantly then, well... I mean, haven't you always wanted to know spells?"

I grinned.

"Who says I don't already?"
