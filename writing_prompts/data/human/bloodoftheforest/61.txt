Wordlessly, I turned my phone's screen around to face the Countess. I watched her roll her eyes in annoyance and then for her expression to slowly turn to one of confusion.

"Well, this is unfortunate. I shall have my chief minion killed for this error." She said, glaring down at the floor with a surprising intensity.

"No no!" I replied quickly. "I'm sure this is all fine. Just - let me get this straight - you told your minion to type up a message inviting me to come *dine* at your castle at 7:30 and though your minion misheard you as saying die, you actually have no intentions of killing me tonight?"

The Countess had mostly regained her composure and had slowly folded her wings away as I'd been talking.

"Of course not, what a waste of a second steal that would be. I just dictated my summons and then - wait a second!"

The countess came closer towards me with a strange expression and my hand drifted towards the gun in my holster.

"You thought I invited you to die but you still came?"

I breathed out and let my hand fall back towards my side.

"Well, yeah."

She raised her eyebrows.

"You're even dumber than I thought. You never come to a death summons. If they really have something to bribe or blackmail you with, they would tell you outright so my message gave you no reason at all to come. Not to mention, even if your enemy does have something you want - never meet them on home turf. Take something of the greater value of their own and get them to make a trade at a location of your choosing. Come, we shall discuss this over the first course."

I followed her as she gestured me through to the lobby. I have to admit, the place was stunning. I guess being a vampiric sorceress with continued ties to the upper echelons of society has more benefits than a sometimes student, sometimes vigilante with unnaturally fast reflexes. 

"You're giving me advice? What, is this a truce?"

The countess laughed so sharply and suddenly that it sounded almost like a bark.

"No dear, no truce. Just talking. Talking and food. You entertain me and whilst I cannot let you stop me from completing The Ritual, I am quite enamoured with your other pursuits. Maybe even enough to help fund them."

Her words stayed ringing in my head even after we'd moved through to the enormous dining room. Could I really make a deal with the devil and come out on top? Particularly because in this case the 'devil' part might actually be pretty close to literal - nobody's one hundred percent sure how The Countess got her powers.

My nose twitched as a door to the left of me opened and two of The Countess' servants brought plates to us with clockwork precision. 

I didn't know if I could really make a deal but a free meal is a free meal. I picked up my fork and dug in.
