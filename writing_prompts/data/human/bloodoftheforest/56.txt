I'm not a monster, but I have a kit in the back of my car. It's kinda like a serial killer kit but it's for kindness instead of murders and so that makes it okay. I think.

I'm not a terrible person but a good ninety percent of the time that I help people out is just because they're so much easier to be around that way.

And I'm really not a psychopath but over the years I've developed a cheat sheet for dealing with people's most dramatic situations.

Take the past two weeks, for example. Two of my close friends went through a fight that made them consider breaking up, my brother got into a fistfight outside his local pub (which is very much *not* local to me) and my girlfriend's purse got stolen. Now, I responded very well to each of those situations according to the people involved but what none of them realise is that I have responded the exact same way to the past ten breakups, fights and thefts that I've been around for. People never want to believe they're predictable or easy to manipulate but for the most part all of us are. It's just that most individuals aren't racking up the sheer numbers of data points in their life that I am.

At one point I had actual, physical folders of what events I'd been about for, what I'd done and the end result. I think I'd realised that I was attracted to drama at some point in my teenage years. Not in the weird, vampiric way that some people are attracted to it but more in the magnetic sense. I'd just always be there, somehow.

I'd text a meme to a friend at the exact moment they'd been contemplating suicide.

I'd walk in on my coworkers fucking even though I wasn't on shift that day, I'd just left my coat there the day before.

I'd drop in on my sister to return her fancy heels on the same day she found out she was pregnant.

Maybe this all sounds rather exciting to you or at the very least manageable but you need to understand that these three examples are just plucked at random out of thousands. I can't remember having a single week where I haven't unwittingly rocked on up into someone else's drama. 

Trust me, after awhile drama itself gets pretty boring.

It's not even like I have low empathy. I love the people am close to right into their very bones and I revel in their happiness and sting from their pain. I think maybe I'm just tired. Or that nothing seems life changing to me now after so many years of feeling that pleasure and pain every week without fail. It's like an ice cube left on my skin until it feels cool, until I feel it burn and then until I feel nothing at all.

But as I said, I still love people.

I don't know if there are others like me, magnetised in this same way. Even if there are I suppose I have no reason to be certain they'd respond similarly like some weird little drama scientist. But they might. Hell, you might even know me personally. Stranger things have certainly happened and given my condition perhaps this post is tempting fate. Perhaps not though, people finding out I'm like this would probably count as my own personal drama and to tell the truth my own narrative (once you take out this strange kind of bystander thing) is practically boring.

So if you read this and you think you might No someone like me or even me myself then I hope you understand how I operate now. I'm bored, burned out and clinically systematic but the people I do love I love to bits.

And I'm doing the very best I can.
