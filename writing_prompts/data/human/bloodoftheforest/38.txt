(Part 2 of 2)

Two weeks later my grandfather died. It was expected yet still heartbreaking. My mother, his daughter, was a magical advisor to the crown and so whilst she managed to come down to arrange and attend the funeral her job was too important to stay away from for any considerable length of time. Which left the task of organising his effects down to me.

My grandfather did not exactly have a hoard of wealth but he did have shelves of magical tomes along with a number of treasured items. The items he had chosen to keep didn't always make a great deal of sense. He'd chosen to sell on a beautifully gilded copy of Agatha's Alchemical Absolutes because he had a functional copy at home and yet an expensive-looking lute, which he had told me himself that he had never learned how to play, was displayed proudly in his study. At the stage in my life I'd registered how strange this was, I'd also decided it was not in my interest to question it.

I started going through his things in the basement. Whilst most homes featuring a basement treated it as an afterthought or merely a place for wine storage, my grandfather had used this room as regularly as many others and displayed several prized objects there (which is not to say it was completely devoid of wine). One that caught my eye was a short bow, mounted on the wall above a small bookshelf. It was not particularly ornate and rather it drawn my gaze because of its very plainness. 

Some men would have kept a bow because of the hunts or battles that they had used it in but my grandfather had developed amendments to ranged spells as a college mage to cause them to lock on self sufficiently because he himself had such poor aim. I had no idea why he'd been so attached to a bow like this and I found myself reaching up to it in a trance, wishing I'd known more about the man whilst I'd still had the chance.

"Hi!" A voice rang through my mind. "You must be Tiff!"

Oh. So this is what madness feels like.

"Tiff?" The voice asked anxiously. "Are you okay?"

"Who's saying that?!" I yelled.

Some would say talking to imaginary voices means you're crazy. I personally felt like that ship had already sailed, so why the hell not open up some kinds dialogue between myself and my newfound delusions?

"Oh, of course! Edward had warned me that this might be difficult for you, my apologies." The voice said as I turned my head this way and that in an attempt to locate the source. "I'm Diana, I adventured with your grandfather. Shot a blue drake from the sky? Was found in a box in a gnoll cave? I'm sorry, I'm not certain what stories he told you."

"Diana the archer?" I asked, increasingly perturbed that this voice seemed to be located inside my skull.

"Hm. Yes? No. Well, sort of. Diana the bow."

The pause dragged itself along like a rider dangling from a stirrup.

"I suppose technically Edward was the archer. But only when he was holding me. It makes sense he'd have hidden the enchanted weapons from people though, lest they fall into the wrong hands and all that. And it is quite lovely to find out that he gave me all of the credit."

"Enchanted weapon?" I asked hollowly.

"Yes. One of the gang, so to speak." There was a slight pause. "My understanding is that you yourself haven't decided to head to mages college just yet. Are you nonetheless familiar with the fact that enchanted objects are only functional for their current owner?"

"I guess." I said, mentally counting the number of objects in the house that I'd never understood why he owned.

"Well by the same token, nobody but your grandfather could have even so much as heard our voices. Not unless we were stolen for so long that that link faded, or he chose to relinquish ownership of us or..." she let me fill in the blank.

"Or you were inherited." I finished.

"Or we were inherited, yes! Lovely to meet you by the way. Did I say that already? I'm making a right pig's ear of this, aren't I?" Nervous laughter suddenly sounded in my skull. "Still, out of all of the objects you could have picked up you didn't pick the worse one I don't think. Could have been Eric."

"Eric the bard?" I asked incredulously.

"Yes, you're lucky enough to have inherited every last one of the party. There's a list of us written on the underside of the desk in case you need it but I should be able to describe the whole gang. We weren't all necessarily on the same adventures but he did care about me enough to update me on the ones that I missed."

I sat heavily on the floor, letting Diana fall softly from my grasp.

"Why did he choose me? My mother is much more..."

"Busy?" Diana interrupted. "Politically entangled? Sensible? She really does sound like an excellent woman but when it comes to inheriting a number of adventuring items, she isn't exactly the natural choice. You however! Magical and curious, morally decent but with a rebellious streak? Don't you just make a *beautiful* choice for adventurer?"

It wasn't something I'd really considered I could ever do. I had magical gifts but they weren't different or extreme enough to be noteworthy. But Diana was an incredible archer. Leonard was one of the strongest barbarians of our time. Eric had used song to charm his way into courts that no other stranger would be able to enter.

My grandfather really had been an adventurer. In fact, it seems it had been several.

And with the help of the adventuring party I'd heard tales of ever since my childhood, I would be too.
