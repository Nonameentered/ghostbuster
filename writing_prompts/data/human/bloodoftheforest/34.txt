When I have no confidence in my writing I remember that practicing writing is like exercise in that even when it sucks, it improves your general skill level far more than doing nothing at all. The main problem I've had with low confidence is that it makes me freeze up out of a warped sense of perfectionism so counting suck writing as a successful 'exercise' helps me deal with that.

Not to mention, the things I've written that I've been most pleased with and the things that have gotten the most upvotes haven't even vaguely resembled each other. If I'd chosen not to write a story about a giant spider because I didn't think I could make it awesome then I'd never have learned that a lot of people actually quite like the style I adopted for that one.
