*When you look into the void, the void looks back.*

The message was written on a small plaque on the caged shelf of books. It was meant to be a warning that if you choose to unlock this shelf and leaf through these tomes then your mind was surely forfeit. Instead, it was the key to our salvation.

"Can you pick the lock?" Lyra asked me and I nodded nervously.

Unlike myself, Lyra was an occultist. She was still years away from ever having a hope of being allowed to perform the rituals I was about to grant her access to but that didn't matter anymore. Anyone who was proficient in anything like this was long since dead.

The tension wrench shifted in my grip and the lock clicked open. I stood aside and allowed Lyra to take the books, almost too nervous to touch them.

"What now?" I asked her.

She removed the books one by one, laying them out in front of her.

"I need to find the ritual."

I surveyed the room. Only one door in or out. A window means that there is a potential second entrance for attackers but also means we aren't truly trapped if they choose to enter through the door. Some half decent hiding spots, though nothing that would stand up to an even half decent search.

I gestured for Lyra to move under one of the desks and she did so, taking all of the forbidden books with her.

"How long?" I asked, knowing the answer.

"I don't know. I don't know for sure which book it's in, I don't know how advanced a ritual it is, I don't even know if the supplies I've brought will be the right things."

She looked near tears so I didn't voice the final thing she didn't know. I didn't say out loud that she didn't know for sure that the ritual existed. Instead I awkwardly patted her shoulder.

"You'll be fine." I said and headed closer to the door. 
 
I could hear Lyra muttering frantically under her breath as I looked for the best vantage point. Since I could hardly tell her to shut up with anything that might be helping me concentrate I just had to hope she'd shut the hell up if the door creaked open.

When the institute had seen fit to hire me rather than allow authorities to capture me I had been prepared for outlandish possibilities. Killing aliens, humans who had been enhanced beyond the brink of commonly known science, I'd even been trained to deal with telepathic attack. But hanging out in some secret society headquarters with what could best be described as some kind of witch? Ridiculous.

The problem being of course, that this creepy mumbo jumbo was the best chance we had against invasion. Not aliens, despite what I had been prepared for there were no living aliens left. What we were hiding from was not aliens but the things that killed them.

I climbed one of the shelves and lay there, my gun aimed at the door. I couldn't hear anything aside from the gentle rustle of pages and mumbling that came from Lyra's corner. *It's likely that they don't know any occultists are left alive.* I told myself. *They have no reason to come here.*

The Eldritch couldn't destroy us from within the same way they had with other alien races. A distress beacon that we found millions of years too late detailed the usual way they took over all too well. They'd infect minds and effectively control some of the aliens, leaving others to serve as their playthings until they were done with that planet, that star system, that freaking galaxy in some cases. We saw evidence of the same thing again and again.

"I have it." Lyra whispered quietly, only just loud enough for me to hear.

I clambered down to talk with her.

"Can you do it?" I asked.

She traced her finger across the page, both nodding and frowning.

"Maybe. I don't quite have all of the materials so I'll have to substitute and hope for the best. And I've never done anything like this."

She took chalks, candles and gemstones out of her backpack and then suddenly squeezed me into a hug.

"What was that for?"

Lyra gave me a frozen sort of smile that seemed to mostly function as a way of stopping her from crying.

"If this works then I don't think I'll survive. And, well, there's nobody else left for me to hug."

With that she started drawing arcane nonsense on the floor and left me to my gun.

I didn't believe in magic but being sent on this assignment was proof enough that there must be something to it. I wasn't supposed to be here alone but it seemed that after this weird spooky society the institute had been the second major target.

The eldritch couldn't attack us directly but it turned out they were more than capable of making things which could.

Lyra started chanting. Actual, belongs-in-horror-movie *chanting.* I didn't know the language and I was too focussed on the door to see exactly what else she might be doing.

Because of this, I didn't know exactly when her ritual began to glow.

Tendrils of brilliantly glowing darkness crept through the room and the floor began to shake. I heard noises from outside and realised that we were unlikely to remain alone for very long.

"Can you chant any faster?!" I yelled as I heard frantic footsteps approaching.

The door didn't creak as it opened after all, the thing behind it had enough strength to force it clean off its hinges.

I knew that the shots I was firing could only really serve to slow these monstrosities down. Books whipped about in the air around us and I backed away from the door until I fell. I never stopped firing though, not even as I screamed with rage and pain and the blood on my face trickled into my eyes.

Then it was done.

No light.

No shaking.

No creatures.

I approached Lyra and found her alive but incoherent, her eyelashes twitching and muttering in the same strange language she'd been chanting in before. The Elder god had driven her to madness but, if the lack of assailants was any sort of evidence, she'd done the same to him. A strange but overall human mind had broken a being which had taken down civilisations.

I wonder what she was like.
