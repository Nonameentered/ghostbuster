*We do not suffer fools or injustice. We do not suffer rudeness or lies. We value wisdom, vengeance, etiquette and truthful tongue.

And those who do not follow our ideals shall suffer.*

My palm connected so forcefully with the church door that cracks formed around the point of impact. It swung open to show filled pews of alarmed faces, each one of them turned to face me with expressions of confusion and shock as if this outcome hadn't been guaranteed weeks ago.

Stupidity would still have had to be punished, a lesser punishment but a punishment nonetheless. But that wasn't what had happened here. The king and queen were not unaware of the rules of the fey, indeed there were three fairies right there at the altar. Their eyes were not as clouded by fear as the humans in the church, perhaps because it would have taken me so much more effort to hurt me. Instead they seemed merely curious and waited for something to react to, still as boulders and beautiful as storms.

Everyone else of note in the kingdom had been invited here, hundreds of little envelopes sent out to their recipients over a month ago. Not inviting another noble like myself would have been unthinkable even between humans but for my kind it was tantamount to an act of war. I walked purposefully up the aisle to the font, glaring all those who surrounded me and shrank back in my wake.

I reached the font where the priest still held the baby girl. Her hair was wet and as the only one blissfully unaware of what was happening in this room she was probably the happiest person here.

Suddenly I was filled with a new, deeper fury not for myself but for this clueless and helpless child. I knew the king hated me, I knew that the fey who served as his royal advisors despised me and whilst I was angry that they'd excluded me just to make a statement and cause me pain at least it was expected. But to drag this innocent child right into the firing line of my wrath for no better reason than petty politics was such a pointless cruelty that I couldn't stand it.

The skies outside darkened and it seemed as though everyone was holding their breath in anticipation of what I'd do. If it was solely a question of pride then perhaps I wouldn't have cursed her at all. But it is impossible for me to break the laws of my kind, even if I wanted to.

Aurora was the only child these rulers would ever be able to have. It wasn't common knowledge but it was something I could see. If I cursed Aurora to die right then and there then I would have gone further than anyone expected and the royal bloodline would be well and truly broken.

I had to curse her.

I couldn't hurt her.

It was bad enough that she was viewed as nothing but a tool by parents who were supposed to love her, I couldn't bear to make that worse.

I chose my words very carefully:

"One day exactly five years from now your daughter shall open a normal door but the other side of this doorway will be on the side of the tallest face of Skyscar Cliffs. Even though the drop down from that point would be enough to kill a fully grown adult she will step through that doorway unhesitatingly and she will fall.

Nobody watching me today will be able to do a thing to prevent this curse. No message seeking outside assistance will be understood, much less heeded.

This is the curse I give you for rejecting me today."

The king began to beg me to change my mind but I leapt from the ground and flew away.

-----

Five years later the princess was in her normal bedroom, as nobody in the kingdom had any power to put her somewhere without doors. Aurora opened her wardrobe and as the smell of the sea air drifted into the empty room behind her she stepped forward, and she fell.

I flew down from the ledge bedside her at breakneck speeds and caught Aurora before she could dash her head on the rocks below. The door slammed shut and disappeared and as I held her tightly I took her towards my home in the forest.

The kingdom will have no heir and that is just, as they do not deserve one.

I wish I could say that the princess's life will be easy in the care of an ostracised fairy but I suspect that it won't. She will feel isolated at times and just like me she might never feel that she has anywhere she truly fits in.

However I can promise her that I will never view her as a pawn. I will never look at her and see only the political marriages that she can offer or an empty plot, ready and waiting for a seed to be planted to further a pointless bloodline.

Instead she is my child.

And I shall love her fiercely.
