From the moment Sandra failed to top up the coffee in the office kitchen I knew this meant war. Sandra is a nice lady. She donates to any random charity causes that circulate the office, will almost always swap a shift with somebody if they need it and on the few occasions she's brought her baking into the office it's genuinely been the best thing I'd ever tasted. Sandra is also a literal supervillain. Meanwhile on the other end of things you have me, someone who in costume pretty much everyone would define as a superhero but in here I'm merely the office bitch. It's nothing I do on purpose - it's just that whilst I'm a good hero I'm not all that loveable as a human being.


Sandra can't tell anybody who I really am because then I would tell everyone who she really is. Sure, I could call other heroes in but she'd then call other villains in. My coworkers know I have a boyfriend and live with my parents and because of this, so does Sandra. Likewise, I know that Sandra has a loving husband and not only kids but grandkids too. If either one of us pulls the trigger then so does the other and there's just something a million times easier than trying to literally tear Sandra's alterego into two bloody pieces than giving the superteam directions to her house twenty minutes away where her husband Dave is probably finishing assembling their new bookcase. I've met Dave, he's lovely, and frankly my weird awkwardness at the idea of sending anyone after actual human beings plays almost as much of a part in our weird stalemate as the creeping horror that if anyone went after Sandra's family then mine would be next.


So the coffee incident began over a year of bizarre little micro aggressions on the battlefield that is Mandy's Mugs Incorporated. A rational person might have considered the possibility that Sandra had simply forgotten to purchase coffee (that of everyone in today, only I drank) when they had gone to the shop for milk despite there not only being a tin filled with teabags but a brand new box of teabags behind them. However, Sandra is a supergenius and has never previously forgotten anything she's been asked to grab for the office. Ever. Also, the teabags are all decaffinated and if that doesn't show that she's pure evil to you then I don't know what will.


I humphed back to my desk but I couldn't say anything. Complain that Sandra, \*lovely\* Sandra, had forgotten coffee? Coming from the office bitch all that would do would solidify people's opinion of me.


A week later Sandra's desk and all of it's silly knicknacks fell apart seemingly out of nowhere. She fixed the briefest glare on me but who would realistically believe that I easily had the strength to almost snap every desk leg in our lunchbreak? Two weeks after that my computer seemingly got a virus that meant every key I hit wouldn't type anything for at least a second. It wasn't until a full month after that when I saw that Sandra's car was just next to a no parking zone and gave it a little nudge to be fully in the zone. She got a hefty fine for that.


We've done this for a year. Sandra has the advantage that she's smarter than me but also the downside that if she sees any predicament that she's caused in front of other coworkers then to be anything less than caring and helpful would damage her reputation. I went to the kitchen to grab myself coffee, groaning internally when I remembered that Sandra was the one who was meant to buy it last. Imagine my surprise when I found a fresh new jar of coffee in the cupboard. Instant sure, but a \*nice\* brand instead of the usual.


I opened it and gave a cautious sniff. My physiology means that I can't actually be poisoned so that wasn't a concern and moreover, I'm pretty sure she knows that. It smelled gorgeous. I made myself a cup and wondered if this gesture meant that our little war was over. Hopefully at least for today - my shoulder is freaking killing me from when Sandra's mechs pulled my arm off last night and quite frankly I'm just not in the freaking mood.
