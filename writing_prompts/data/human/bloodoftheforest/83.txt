I would have ideally avoided talking to anyone on my journey through Białowieża Forest but a tour group saw me as I was beginning to veer off the Tsar's trail.

"Miss! *Miss!* I don't think you should be going that way!"

I could have ignored them but I had real concerns that someone would simply follow me so I headed to talk to the group. There were too many of them, chattering and snapping photos as if they belonged. As if there modern world had any place in this area where humanity has yet to wipe out the primeval elements of its past. I smiled a winning smile that I had practiced in the mirror many times.

"Hello there! I'm a conservation biologist actually, I'm authorised to be here to survey invasive species in the land, to ensure they haven't caused unexpected damage."

I flashed my pass at the tour group leader and he relaxed instantly. I'd made it in my own home with no particular reference but he won't check. They never do.

"How interesting!" The guide said, trying to recover from the faux pas. "What's the invasive species that you're tracking?"

*You.*

"Spruce bark beetles." I said, though I was aware he would not know if this was correct or not.

He pretended to know exactly what species I meant and no longer bothered me as I left the trail again. I walked for hours, far from the area scarred by treks and trails. I walked past several bison and ensured that they did not see me. I am, in a way, no less an invasive animal here than the humans I have walked away from. But whilst their kind claim custody of the forest I have long ago allowed the forest to claim custody over me. Birds that would be skittish around tourists are calmer here and every time I see one I make every effort to be unseen. There's a stillness about them, a sort of reverence. They know more about this forest than I could ever hope to.

Finally, I reach my destination. A large oak that humans have not yet decided to christen with a bizarre name it neither asked for nor wanted. Silently, I tell the keeper of this forest what I have seen so far.

I will defend this place with my life if I have to. Only time will tell the day I have to make good on this promise.
