Given the current current human population on Earth (7,979,116,957 and counting) and the very low number of actual, legitimate alien abductions of humans (it's 19, not that that matters) it's very likely that something supernatural had marked Ava as worthy of capture. And given the fact that she had no special abilities of her own and was a mostly unremarkable child in the greater scheme of things we can then reach the conclusion that Ava was abducted in her sleep due to her contact with at least one of two otherworldly creatures.

The first of these creatures was an angel.

The second was a monster.

Ava had never completely seen the monster under her bed but she'd seen hints of her. She'd seen the slick, shadowformed tendrils that wisped out from under the bed frame, sometimes barely there but other times all too solid. Whilst these are the very things that children are supposed to fear all Ava felt was hope that this creature could be sort of like a friend. Being friendless is a far scarier prospect than knowing a monster and the way Ava saw it there was no rule that both participants at a sleepover had to be human.

Whilst the monster wanted Ava to see her, the angel should never really have been seen. There was a slight mix up (to put it diplomatically) and to cut a long story short, Ava was informed of a prophecy that wasn't really meant for her. The angel was quick to
inform Ava that it had been a mistake but it did leave the slightly sticky issue that Ava now definitely knew about the existence of angels. Petriel has been in a human form but had added the glowing halo and other such bells and whistles. It was decided that Petriel would simply be assigned as Ava's guardian angel, an odd arrangement as she had seen them but the best settlement outside of memory wiping (which is no longer approved).

Petriel and the monster (whose name is not being withheld but simply doesn't exist) had known about each other before the abduction but had never formally met. They had no need to and each held some distaste about the other.

The concept of Ava being in danger changed all that. Suddenly the two had no qualms about meeting. More than that, they were eager to work together.

The ship was quickly far away from Earth but distance is meaningless to angels. And as for the monster, she could travel in shadows and to her the darkness of space was just as easy to move through as the space under Ava's bed.

*EEEeeeekkkkrrrrggghuuuhh*

The sounds of metal breaking and engines protesting filled the ship. The angels looked to their screens but there was nothing there.

The noise got louder and suddenly the engine was gone, floating serenely past one of the windows in several pieces. More disturbingly it seemed that those pieces had been *bitten* apart.

In the resulting chaos, dark and gentle tendrils lifted an unconscious Ava and carried her towards an escape pod. She stirred in her drugged state but was mostly quiet.

Both the girl and the monster reached the pod but they were not alone. An alien approached them and aimed his pistol ready to fire. If he had aimed at the monster then there was a small chance he could have lived. But given the choice between trying to aim at a shifting, incomprehensible being of darkness and a small and fragile child the alien chose the latter.

This turned out to be a mistake.

As he squeezed the trigger a being comprised of light and fire appeared between the shooter and his target. Perhaps sensing what was going to happen, the monster shoved Ava into the pod hastily and phased into the control panel until it was forced to eject.

Petriel burned the ship in a righteous fury as only the angels can. The fires that they started decided to burn even in areas exposed to the vacuum of space. None of the aliens aboard the vessel survived the blaze.

Minutes later the pair of odd beings steered the pod that contained their charge slowly back to Earth. Petriel provided the raw power and the monster steered the way easily and precisely. Getting her through the atmosphere and back to her bed was more difficult but they managed. Petriel watched over Ava as she slept and the monster retreated to her usual home beneath the bed.

And, as she had not awoken at any point during the abduction, it was simply never spoken of again.
