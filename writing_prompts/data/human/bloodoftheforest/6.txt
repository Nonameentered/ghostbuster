It was supposed to be easy. Hell, it *was* easy. But now, five hours after murdering The Starlit Avenger, I was beginning to think maybe it was easy because I'd fucked up...

My research was meticulous and my plan was flawless. Many have tried to kill The Avenger before now and some have probably even figured out his secret identity but I had genius, resources and patience on my side. I used electronic surveillance extensively and watched him for months after I'd finally connected The Avenger's mundane half to his more *dramatic* side.

I could have left the wife. Some would say that waiting for her was nothing but cruelty. But I wanted the city to see that there was nothing good or exceptional about Avery Jones. That he was flawed and human and not in any way worth their adoration.

A living wife would have ruined that. With a wailing, mourning widow the public would have been swayed to sympathy instead of making their own, rather less favourable conclusions.

So I waited.

And I waited.

In the time I had surveyed them they had spent every single evening together. There was no reason this should have been different. Midnight hit and I weighed my options with concern. I could leave and try to track her down but I had no clear lead as to where she was. Waiting too long also felt unwise.

In the end my choice was made for me.

I heard an alarm clock in the next room and whilst I started off to shut it up somebody took advantage of my distraction.

A thick wire was suddenly around my neck and so of course my first instinct was to try to pry it off me. A foolish, stupid instinct as in that moment she was close enough that I could probably have reached her. Hit her, kicked her, bit her - done *something.*

Suddenly, a sharp pain in my leg and the world became a little vaguer.

By the time Mrs Jones had stood in front of me I could barely move. She turned the alarm clock off with a small remote and held a kitchen knife in front of her. I tried to flail and instead my arm simply flopped limply. And a minute later I couldn't even do that.

Mrs Jones didn't look sad. No, that woman looked lit up with a pained fury I'm not sure I'd seen before. I felt quite certain that if this altercation had gone the other way and I'd had the upper hand then then afterwards the valkyries would have taken her in a heartbeat.

"You found him." She said simply.

She considered her own words and then looked at the knife in her left hand. She sunk it slowly into my right leg and though she surely knew that whatever she'd injected with me meant I barely felt it she let it venture deeper and deeper until she finally stopped.

"You heartless, broken bastard."

She spat in my face. In many ways this upset me more than whatever mutilation she had committed to my leg.

"You know the name? 'Starlit Avenger.' That was because the original vigilante acts he committed were all at night. And he didn't tell me about it, not at first."

I saw her trying not to cry and then with a scream she did *something* to my toes. I couldn't see my toes and so was forced to leave that one to my imagination.

"You were so arrogant in thinking you'd caught him you didn't even think about the fact that in recent years he was reported to have helped people at night and in the day. Doing ridiculously intense acts over the same twenty four hour period."

She put something in my mouth and I could vaguely taste iron. I wanted to scream but instead I just exhaled a high pitched and empty noise.

"He was wonderful and you extinguished him because you are a pathetic, evil man. But you didn't kill The Starlit Avenger. Only half of him."

Abigail Jones began to tie me up then but she kept speaking.

"First thing tomorrow there will be an call from The Starlit Avenger tipping the mayor off that you are going to commit an act of terrorism on his office. They'll evacuate and be perfectly safe but as soon as they've all left the office will explode.

"The bodies of both The Starlit Avenger and his disgusting nemesis will be found in the wreckage. Everybody will know that he died heroically saving this city.

"He'll be remembered as a martyr, a hero. And you, you won't be remembered at all."

She had finished her knots and was satisfied with them.

"After a little while I'll be a new hero. The city will be a little more on my side and I'll be a totally new person. Meanwhile you won't be anything at all."

Mrs Jones pulled a comfortable chair to face me and settled into it. The weapons that had still been on my person when she'd arrived were in a small pile behind her.

"Sleep tight you bastard. Tomorrow's going to hurt."
