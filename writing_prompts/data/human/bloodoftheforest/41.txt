I read the sign a second time but it was the same bizarre message as the first time. 

*Huh,* I thought to myself, *well i suppose I'd prefer a confusing workplace prank over a cruel one.*

The elevator made a familiar 'bing' as I reached my floor and I was alarmed for a moment

*Calm down. All elevators make the same tone, the sign's just gotten in your head is all.*

I met my coworker Jeff in the corridor, cheerily walking back from the kitchen with a mug of hot coffee in his hand.

"Did you see the game last night?" He asked me with a smile on his face that was downright unnatural for 9am.

"Why, is that why you're so happy today?"

He laughed and shook his head.

"Good one Sammy-boy." He joked as I headed for my office. "You read the sign in there?"

This stopped me in my tracks.

"Yes. What's all that about?"

There was no response and though I didn't hear him walk away he was gone before I'd turned around.

I logged in to the computer quickly and replied to various emails before I could start my day properly. Nothing interesting, just various customers with simple to resolve queries. All simple, if a little frustrating.

Even though the door was fully open I heard a gentle knock on it.

"Come in."

Sharon walked in with my 10:30 cup of coffee. I knew it would be her already though, literally nobody else would ever bother knocking. Those lower than me in the company would go through Sharon to meet with me and those higher than me would see no reason to announce ask permission before walking in. 

"Perfect timing." I told her with a grin and she placed the coffee down on my desk.

As she pulled her hand away though, she slipped. Coffee splashed around her fingers and the framed photo of my wife toppled backwards. Sharon gasped.

"Hey, it's fine, it didn't-" I stopped dead when I looked at her face.

Sharon's face was contorted in an expression of horror. Not embarrassment, not guilt but genuine, looking-at-a-dead-body *horror.*

"It's fine." I muttered, unable to stand looking at her for a moment longer.

When I finally did look back up, she was gone.

I righted the frame and realised that the photo inside was no longer quite straight. I swivelled the fastenings off the back but to my surprise the back of the photograph was no longer blank but had "if you are experiencing feelings of deja vu report to management immediately" scrawled across it. I stormed out to confront Jeff.

"What's the meaning of this!" I yelled, thrusting the photo under Jeff's nose. "Some kind of trick on the new guy?"

"Hey, you okay?" Jeff asked. "Did you get a weird email or something?"

"Oh, fuck off. I've gotten pretty much the exact same emails I've gotten in my previous ten years at this place. Only thing different about today is this 'deja vu' prank bullshit."

"But how do you know they're the same, if you're new? What makes you think they're the same as usual?"

I frowned at him but I didn't have an answer.

"You know, there's a term for that feeling..." Jeff told me as I sped from the room.

I knew where management was in this building even though I couldn't remember an orientation. Usually I'd knock but today I saw no reason to.

"What's happening?" I asked as I sat down in front of my boss without invitation.

"Did you delay coming here once you identified the deja vu?" 

I shook my head and Luther sighed.

"What's going on?" I pressed, more anxious this time.

"We were hoping you'd be faster this time. But at least you took the elevator on this run."

I didn't want to ask. Every fibre of me begged the words to stay out of my mouth but instead I asked-

"Why?"

"Six months ago you were involved in an accident. An elevator technician was incorrectly informed that the entire office was to be empty and so neglected to put the required safety barriers up in front of the open shaft doors whilst he carried out some minor maintenance. You were gloating to a coworker about a sports game from the night before when you turned the corner and whilst you noticed that the doors were open you didn't notice that there was no elevator inside until it was too late.

Your assistant came to your screams and when she saw you she alerted emergency services. Whilst the trauma lead her to have to seek therapy and ultimately leave this job you would have died without her actions. Unfortunately, that wasn't the end of the trouble.

You were almost completely paralysed after the accident. Nobody could have processed that without at least some upset but for you it conjured a complete psychotic break. You forgot everything about your work, your friends, even your family. You constructed a complete and intricate delusion to protect you from anything that could remind you of what happened with barely any periods of lucidity but your mood was still declining despite this survival mechanism. It was believed by both your wife and your psychiatrist that to ever gain any real quality of life you would have to be aware of the past and yet us simply telling you would be no good. I could tell you right now that the sky is a constant orange, would you believe that?"

"No." I whispered.

"Exactly. And since the facts we needed to make you aware of in this instance are related to your personal history the mind would reject them even more violently. But we had this program. We could leave you messages, make AI for your coworkers and whilst we couldn't see everything you do we can read your speech centre. We could find out when you chose to speak to management and"

"And you could time it." I finished for him.

"Yes," Luther nodded, "but it seems you aren't quite there yet. No matter. We'll go again."

"No, wait!" I screamed.

"See you next time, Samuel."
