I'm really glad you liked reading this, thank you! I'm not sure what my favourite thing I've written would be and also sometimes things are fun to write but then don't get much feedback so I assume weren't great to read (I liked writing 'She didn't steal my shadow' for example). Also it obviously depends the kinds of things you personally enjoy reading. I'd maybe say either [Timelessness](https://www.reddit.com/r/Leavesandink/comments/o06zkb/timelessness/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) or [A Spooky Writing Prompt](https://www.reddit.com/r/Leavesandink/comments/o6i3ja/a_spooky_writing_prompt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) as somewhere to start if you're interested.
