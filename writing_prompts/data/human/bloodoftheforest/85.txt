"I want you to kill my daughter's soulmate." Mr King told me dispassionately.

"Okay. Do you their name yet or is that part of the assignment?" I asked.

I didn't need to ask who Mr King's daughter was, that would be quite trivial to find out.

"That's part of it. Is that not acceptable?"

I shrugged.

"Fine with me. That will costs more, you noticed that, right?" I checked, though I doubted that'd be an issue.

"Money is of no concern. I believe you requested half upfront."

Mr King slid a briefcase across the table. Given that the amount of money did not require a briefcase worth of size I wondered how likely it was that he did that for dramatic effect. As I reached for it, he spoke up again.

"Would you kill him even if he is an innocent man?"

*Really now? Head of a crime family and you feel like playing this game?*

"Makes no odds to me. If you want to ensure her romantic entanglements don't complicate her loyalties or forge some political alliance using her which can't be compromised, that's fine as long as I'm paid."

"Actually, we're estranged."

I mentally kicked myself for not knowing a thing like that already.

"I don't overly care what your reasons are. I've only turned down a handful of jobs in my life and for all of them it was some misleading bullshit on the client's side of things." I winced at my own words. "No offence."

"I just want her to be happy." Mr King muttered and for half a second he seemed like an actual human being instead of a monster who'd have another hitman on speedial to come get me if I screwed up.

"Her phylactery is in the case." Mr Smith said, then swiftly departed.


Back at home, I set my tools to work. When souls were discovered by the vibrations they emit, the discovery that there was often a soul out there with the perfect inversion of a person's vibration followed shortly after. It sounds almost poetic in theory but in reality this wasn't a predictor for who would match each other well or even like each other but just which people would be drawn to each other time and time again. That their vibrations mirrored each other so was a predictor of catastrophe at least as often as a healthy relationship but fortunately for Miss King, these patterns were very traceable.

A phylactery was a very old school way of determining someone's soul's frequency but highly effective. Still, I could trace her polar opposite by looking at anything the person could have theoretically have interacted with - physical locations, online presence, you name it. I had physical and digital assistants to help me and in just under a week I had a match.

The guy seemed nice enough, bland but sweet. Still, I hadn't been lying when I said my only dealbreakers were stated upfront. No kids. No intentional trickery. No singers (very long story on that one). He was a jogger which was a hell of a blessing for me as his running app indicated he jogged through a fairly secluded bit of woods. Shoot him their, nab a bit of his blood to shove in a phylactery as proof for Mr King and that's a slam dunk.

The woods was actually so quiet I heard him before I saw him. Lots of crunching leaves and the slightest hint of music playing - a weirdly discordant song that I couldn't place. I was ready to aim the second he came into view when suddenly all of my plans went wrong.

Miss King. She was here, jogging with the soulmate. The reason I couldn't place the song was that they'd both been listening to different music as they ran. They'd already met. Shit. *Shit.* Just when I thought things couldn't get any worse Miss King saw me and screamed.

"Stay away from us! I don't know anything about my father these days, I can't help you with whatever you want!" She yelled at me.

I took too long to respond and rather than run, she walked towards me.

"I promise you, my father hasn't even seen me in years. He wasn't even invited to my bloody wedding. So there is nothing I can do for you and my dad doesn't even know my husband exists so there is no point whatsoever in you doing anything to him!"

*Husband?*

Miss King was shaking slightly but still stood right in front of me. Her face was defiant even if a few tears had escaped and more than once she'd tried to surreptitiously signal for her husband to run.

Her husband had not ran.

I tried to weigh up exactly what would now constitute as failing this job, shooting or not shooting. Then I remembered the last thing Mr King had said about his daughter - "I want her to be happy."

Guess I'd be returning Mr King's money then.

I shoved my gun back in its holster and held my hands up at Miss King (or I guess no longer Miss King, given the whole marriage thing?) in a a defensive position.

"You two are soulmates by the way." I said, as I walked away and left them to their confusion.

I grabbed my bag and headed out of the woods. Still, this did now mean that I couldn't honestly tell future clients that the number of jobs I hadn't completed was any less than six. And five had been such a nice, rounded number.

Damn.
