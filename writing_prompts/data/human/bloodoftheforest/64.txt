I live alone, but the bottle of vodka I was staring at before I called the number was usually hidden. Not just 'out of the way' hidden either - *really* hidden, like a *'I found out the cupboard under the sink kinda has a false bottom so shoved it in there and then stacked cleaning supplies on top'* hidden.

The reason that the bottle was currently fighting me in a staring match instead of hiding under chipboard, sponges and bleach wasn't just losing my job. That was part of it but it was a bit of everything that got to me. Nothing was insurmountable alone but together it was too much.

I unscrewed the bottle. Screwed it back up again. Poured myself a shot. Poured the shot down the sink. Put the bottle in the bin. Pulled it back out again.

If my surname had started with any letter other than 'H' then I'd probably be an alcoholic again right now, how strange is that? That something so petty and random could change a whole life.

As it is, my surname is Holden which means that my sister's surname is also Holden. I knew she was in no place to help me with the financial mess that losing my job had put me into and I knew that she would judge me for having alcohol to hand, if I told her how bad everything had gotten. But I couldn't think of anyone else to call and at the very least I knew she loved me.

I scrolled through my phone to her name but stopped when I saw a number simply called 'Help.' It took me a while to remember why I had this number - some graffiti I'd read in a particularly grimy bathroom stall whilst wasted. "When you need help, call me." It had been etched into the flimsy divider and then stained purple and in my drunken state I'd found it so hilarious I'd saved the number to my phone. It would be stupid to phone a random number in an actual crisis though, surely. And yet I was so certain that I had nothing left to lose that I still called it.

I half expected it not to connect. I didn't really expect someone to answer. I definitely didn't expect what they said.

"Go to the bridge nearest to the bar you found this graffiti in. Be there in half an hour." A male voice commanded.

"Why? Wait, I can't anyway. That's two different buses, it'll take at least an hour."

"You have enough money for a taxi." The voice said and then just like that, the call ended.

I sort of had enough money for a taxi, in that I did have the cash to hand. But I'd just lost my job and had no idea how I was going to find enough money for next month's rent so spending money on a taxi would be ludicrously frivolous.

I can't fully explain why I did it anyway.

The night was bitterly cold and the rain was pouring down when I arrived near the bridge. I felt my phone buzz in my pocket and the screen showed me that 'Help' was calling. Needless to say, I answered.

"Hello?" I asked instantly.

There was a pause.

"You-you're not the same man as before. This is a woman's voice." A shaky female voice said. "You said you'd help me, is this- is this just a trick?"

"What? No. Who are you?" I asked, becoming increasingly aware of how distraught the woman sounded.

"I think I have the wrong number..." the caller said and hung up.

I rang back instantly. It took a moment to connect but then not only did I hear a ringing in my phone but I heard a ringtone going off nearby. I hadn't seen anyone when I'd got here but then I saw her - a slight woman in a dark shirt who was very much on the unsafe side of the bridge's barrier.

I ran towards her as she looked down on the cars below, perhaps psyching herself up to make the jump.

"No!" I yelled and then added. "Look, you called me. You have to at least let us finish our conversation."

She didn't climb back over the barrier but she didn't jump either. The woman turned her head towards me and I saw that her face was a mess of mascara, snot and tears.

"Look, I can't stop you. I wouldn't know how. But I really think we should finish our talk. And since it's pouring out here - could we go somewhere else? I'll buy you a coffee or something."

She looked undecided. It felt like she was expecting some sort of trap.

"Look, I don't know anything about your situation but you did technically call me for help. So let me at least try to help."

Carefully, the woman climbed back to my side of the barrier and I released a breath I hadn't realised I'd been holding.

"I don't actually know where does coffee around here at this time of night." I admitted.

The bar where I originally saw the graffiti might have been open but it wouldn't have served coffee and I did not want to be in a bar right then. Fortunately, the woman had her own suggestion.

"I live across the road. I have coffee." She said.

I went back to her place and, with some coaxing, she told me everything. I drank coffee and listened carefully. I learned about her family, her ex boyfriend, her mental health struggles, she eventually even got around to telling me her name.

"I don't understand how you were on the phone." Ava said after some time.

"Oh. That. Well, to be perfectly honest - I saw the number the same as you. I lost my job recently, I'm not exactly loaded as it is so I was stressed about getting kicked out into the street, it was just all a bit much. That's all. They told me to get to the bridge and then when you called them, I guess they patched it through to them calling me."

"Oh." Ava said. "I'm sorry."

An awkward silence followed and I tried to break it.

"It's a nice place you have here. Nicer than mine."

"Move in then." Ava said.

I was so sure I'd misheard that I asked her to repeat herself but she still said the same thing.

"I'm serious - move in until you get other things sorted. My housemate's room is currently completely empty and I've been paying all of the rent by myself just fine for the past few months." Ava gave a weak grin. "Maybe the graffiti guy wanted us to help each other."

It was crazy and stupid but really, it would solve a few of my problems. 

"Do you really mean that?" I asked.

Ava smiled again, a little less weakly than last time.

"You saved my life, I sort of owe you."

In the months that followed I learned more about Ava and became more honest with her in turn. She admitted that she'd given up on therapy and I confessed to being a recovering alcoholic. To my surprise, she responded to my confession not with alarm but by giving the only bottles of wine she'd had in the house to a friend. I encouraged her to go back to therapy, she helped me look for jobs.

I moved out after a while, having finally found a much better job than the one that had originally fired me. Ava finally found a combination of meds and therapy that quietened her mind somewhat and in doing so, found a way to be comfortable being alone. 

I'd like to say that the first person she dated after doing such hard work on herself was as lovely as she deserved, but to tell the truth - he was a total jerk. Still, at this point Ava had developed healthy enough self esteem to recognise that he was constantly trying to put her down and was assertive enough to end the relationship. And her next relationship was with a pretty okay person, I think.

Because her next relationship was me. We moved in together again, but for love rather than crisis this time. Neither of us felt like we owed the other anything by this point - but we'd move boulders for each other anyway, if necessary. We weren't sure how our relationship would go at first, but it went well.

It went really, really well.

I haven't called the 'Help' since that first time but a few weeks ago I did send him a text. I know that sending wedding invitations is traditionally done by post but I don't know the mystery man's address so I'm afraid it'll have to be tradition be damned this time.

I wonder if he'll come.
