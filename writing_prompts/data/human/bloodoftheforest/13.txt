The drill whined in objection as I continued trying to drive forward. The ground was harder than was ideal and there was some rock but I could see cracks and knew I was making headway. Scans indicated softer earth with some air pockets ahead so if I could press forward just a *little bit* then clearing the rest of the route should be plain sailing.

*Crack!*

The drill surged forward and I finally hit upon the softer soil I'd been promised. But there was a problem.

"Sidney, you're full of shit." I said into my communicator as I clambered out of the driller. "Perfectly researched plans my ass."

The figure ahead stared at me with confusion.

"You can see me?" He asked. "I thought, I thought I'd died."

"Oh, you did. Maybe..." I assessed his style of dress and tried to remember my history lessons from back in school. "Three centuries ago? Or thereabouts. Sorry for disturbing you, the Acclimatisation department should be with you in a week."

"You aren't scared of me. Why aren't you scared of me?"

I raised an eyebrow.

"Should I be? Were you some kinda monster back when you-"

My communicator blared into life and cut me off.

"The plans are fine, Sage. Are you still bitching about that rock? The drill can handle a-"

This time it was my turn to cut him off.

"No, not that. There's a-"

*Crap, what was the most appropriate term? Ghost? Spirit? Untethered? Soul?*

"I mean," I decided, changing tact, "this used to be a graveyard."

"Oh."

*Damned right that's 'oh.'*

"Anyone there?" Sidney asked.

"Right in front of me."

There was a pause and I looked at the spirit apologetically.

"I guess, tell him Acclimatisation will be around at some point soon and then come back to the office."

*Wonderful advice. Certainly couldn't have thought of that myself. Makes perfect sense you earn twice my salary.*

"Um, I guess you heard all that?" I asked the spirit. "Someone will come talk to you in a few days, I'll be going now."

"Wait!" The ghost yelled, though I hadn't so much as turned around yet. "What *is* all of this?"

*Yup, this kinda thing is why I never wanted to work in Acclimatisation. All of what? What can I tell him that won't freak him out? Or scare him? Or make him sob for weeks?*

"We're underground, the surface of the Earth ended up not doing so hot. Or I guess doing too hot. The year's 3073. I work in tunnelling. Um, anything else before I head off?"

I gave him a moment to process. When he was alive the Earth's surface wasn't doing awesome but barely anyone had to live underground. Nowadays literally nobody could live aboveground. It's a lot to deal with, I'd think.

"How can you see me? Are you psychic?"

I burst out laughing before I could stop myself.

"No. Oh, I'm really sorry Mr-"

"I'm Elliot."

"I'm sorry Elliot, it's rude to laugh. So, it turns out that our theory about souls not being about if we bury the body wasn't quite right. They take awhile to manifest and they're not always there but they just can't leave the ground once they're buried. Now nobody can leave the ground we're realising that you guys are still, well, you know. Still sorta here. 

You sometimes start off pinned next to your remains but with some, I dunno, I guess it's training, you can move pretty far from them. Not my department though."

Elliot's eyes widened.

"We're still here? All of us?"

"Yeah," I answered, "I think so. Acclimatisation will know better when they-"

"Did your drill break or does it still work?" He asked urgently.

"Break? Oh it's fine. Just turned off."

"Can you drill just a little further? I was buried only a few metres from my wife. It won't be far."

Sidney would be pissed if I opened more graves but Elliot looked so hopeful I couldn't resist. Besides, I wasn't exactly Sid's biggest fan right now. He could deal with the extra paperwork.

"Sure. I guess I can give it a try."

I climbed back into the driller and Elliot shuffled awkwardly to one side. Even though I knew there'd be trouble when I got back I found myself grinning regardless.

"Just a little further."
