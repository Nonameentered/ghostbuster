I answered the phone distractedly, trying to grab the pen that had just rolled under the couch.

"Honey, what a day..." my husband's voice played through the speaker but was abruptly cut off by two sharp gunshots.

I jolted upright as the phone began to play broken, anguish filled screaming and then after a few moments of this, silence.

Was it a prank? If it was then it was a cruel one and not one which made any sort of sense. Was it meant for someone else? No, there is no way that the voice that had played was anyone other than my husband's.

I was still trying to digest it when I heard the door unlock.

"Honey, what a day..." my husband said.

You know what happens next.

-----

The phone rang and I answered it as I tried to find the pen I'd lost under the couch.

"Honey, what a day..." my husband said when suddenly there were two gunshots cutting his voice off.

There was quiet crying on the other end but more disturbingly were the last words of the call.

"How... did this... phone me..?"

The phone call ended and I went dizzy. It was terrifying enough hearing my husband's voice in the same phonecall as such violence but the last voice had been mine.

"Honey, w-" my husband said but I yelled over him.

"DUCK!"

----

I groped fruitlessly under the couch for my pen as I answered the phone.

"Honey w-" I heard, interrupted by my own yelling.

"DUCK!"

Two gunshots sounded and then frantic scrabbling. The sound of a door slamming shut.

"Out the back!" My husband yelled but I heard the sound of a door broken open.

Then several gunshots, too many. Then quiet until my own voice whispered *"Call him."*

The phone call ended and I immediately phoned my husband.

"What the hell was that call about?" I demanded.

"What call? Look, I'm nearly home how about we talk when I'm back?"

"No!" I said in a panic. "I know this sounds crazy but I heard you die. There was a phone call and I heard someone shooting at you."

There was a brief pause.

"Okay." My husband said with a serious tone. "I need you to go towards the back door-"

"They'll be there! I heard that too!"

He swore almost silently.

"In which case I need you to go into my office and grab the gun in the top drawer of the filing cabinet under the stacked paper. You'll need to hold it with both hands. Shoot *anyone* who tries to enter the office - if it's me then I'll say something first."

"You have a gun?"

"Yes. I have to hang up now. Straight to the office."

I went to the office with the phone still in my hand and retrieved the gun as he'd asked. It felt heavier than I'd imagined guns to be.

I winced when I heard the first gunshot and began to cry once it was joined by others. I tried to be silent and to focus intently on whatever noises came from inside the house but I was a jittery mess and more than once I yelped. The commotion died down and I didn't know what to think.

"I'm outside the office!" My husband yelled. "Can I come in?"

I responded with a garbled yell that was supposed to be 'yes.' He understood anyway.

"We need to leave right away. Grab whatever you can in the next five minutes and we'll go. Maybe less."

"What do you mean?!" I yelled at him. "Who are those people? How did you avoid them? What did they even want with you?!"

"We don't have time-"

*"I AM NOT LEAVING HERE UNTIL YOU ANSWER ME!!"*

He thought about it.

"I might have kept some things from you, things that don't affect you I am but that I don't have time to get into before we need to leave. One of those things, the reason those men turned up, is that I stole something. Something paranormal, something that they want back."

"What?"

"You, Emma. I stole you."
