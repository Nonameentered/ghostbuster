"You're not what we expected." The old man at the door said.

I raised my eyebrows at him and fought the urge to roll my eyeballs so hard they snap themselves free from those pesky optic nerves. The priest on the other side of the door didn't close it - but he didn't open it wide enough for me to get past either.

"I get that a lot." I said and then gave the door a shove.

Honestly, I hadn't thought I'd shoved hard enough that he couldn't have blocked me if he'd really set his mind to it but he fell backwards nonetheless. Maybe I'd underestimated how frail he was?

"What is the meaning of this?" A second voice called.

Ah, so it isn't an issue of frailty. We have an audience and so of course that means that I have to play the part of the big bad and these guys that of the righteous, suffering innocents.

"You're right, how dare I?" I began and an almost palpable air of smugness settled into the four gentlemen in the room, "Should I head back out then?"

Instantly the mood shifted and some variation of "that won't be necessary" left the mouth of each priest.

"Good. I'm Izzy, I'm the priest you sent for. Now do-"

"You're a woman though!" The youngest of the four shouted, though by 'youngest' all I really mean is 'probably won't die in the next month.'

*Though really,* I thought to myself, *that kinda depends how well today goes.*

"Indeed, very true. Our side really doesn't the same childish hang ups about that kinda thing that you do."

And just like that they were back to the mutterings of righteous indignation. After a moment to consider my options I elected to talk over them.

"So, which of you feels like telling me what you summoned?" I pretty much yelled.

"It's your fault, you know!" The only one who hadn't spoken yet insisted.

*Oh, this should be good.*

"Really? I mean, I *literally* just got here - and at one of your requests, I might add. How on Earth is this my fault?"

"There were rumours that the Thomas girl was a witch. I didn't have too much trouble casting the evil out of her but then we learned that she had a coven, and so I thought it was wise to request reinforcements."

*Of course people started saying there was a coven - they learned that saying that would get any woman ostracised from the whole community without even needing evidence of wrongdoing.*

"So, you gathered the other priests together, what happened then?"

Even though he hadn't had much issue attempting to stare me down previously, this question made him stare at the floor.

"No, I didn't. I asked for divine intervention."

*Shit.* I'd assumed that the reason all of the priests were here at once was that they'd all been involved in the events that had led up to this moment and as such had to see it through to the end. I didn't like the idea that whatever had been invoked had been kicking around here for at least as long as it took this moron to gather his three holiest friends here.

"Like, a miracle? To deal with witches?"

"Witches are serious business!" One of them yelled and I laughed quietly.

Witches are sometimes serious business. But most witches who are smart enough to become powerful are also smart enough to avoid detection. There is a reason that most witches the church successfully finds these days are teenaged girls with too much eyeliner and it sure as shit isn't that that's prevailing trend in summoners of demons, spirits and all things spooky.

"But no. I asked for an angel."

The laughter froze in my throat as my blood ran cold.

"It's in the church." The youngest added, unable to keep the fearful tremor from his voice.

Either the words themselves or the sheer *terror* that they carried with them snapped me out of my inaction and I grabbed the heavy tome from my bag.

"An angel? And you thought it was a good idea to let him into the church?!"

I unlocked the book's clasp using the key hung around my neck and cut my hand hastily on the small blade hidden under the strap.

"That was where he came down! And besides, he is supposed to be a gentle and benevolent being. We didn't know, we didn't think that.." he couldn't finish the sentence.

I slammed my bleeding palm onto a sigil-filled page a few pages into the book.

"That he'd kill them? *Have you read the bible?* Angels are furious, powerful beings that can wipe out cities if they deem it necessary. You're almost lucky it only killed your so called witches."

My eyes started crying blood and my hair whipped about from unseen currents. This was undoubtedly alarming to watch but it wasn't the only reason nobody could look at me anymore.

"Oh, Lucifer's grace." I whispered, sickened. "It wasn't just them. You brought others to watch. I bet you just about filled the church with onlookers. All ready to show off your fancy gift from on high."

Runes had begun to scar their way onto my skin from the inside.

"Who did you summon?" I demanded, my fingers ready to find the correct incantation.

"Gabriel."

I stopped. The book slipped from my grasp and I let it. My hair started to obey gravity again and my skin's scars faded away.

I looked around the room, away from the priests who were no doubt still cowering away from me. Ah, good. I spied the wine in the corner of the room and opened a bottle. Was it intended to be communion wine? No matter, even if it'd already been blessed such things wouldn't actually hurt me.

"Guess what?" I asked.

The pause stretched for some time. I took a glug from the bottle, then another, then two more. Finally, when I realised nobody was going to reply to me I decided I'd answer myself.

"We're fucked."
