The guard tried to storm into the library but the head librarian positioned herself firmly in his path. She was not a large woman and the guard was a tall, muscular man but the way that the librarian carried herself gave him pause. She had drawn herself up to her full, diminutive height and was glaring at him with such fierceness that he realised he would have to physically throw her aside if he wanted to get past her. Instead he attempted to appeal to reason.

"Look, sanctuary isn't just something that any old building can offer." He explained. "It's for holy places and that kid is a criminal. You have to let me in."

"Why?" She demanded, without even a pause for thought.

Behind the head librarian other staff members had already led the child out of the guard's view and the longer he wasted on this conversation the less chance he had of knowing if the brat had chosen to hide or run. If run, where did the exits from the library lead? It was fairly central and depending on the number of windows there could be a variety of different escape routes.

"What do you mean 'why?' - I just told you that you have to right to block me. This isn't a holy place."

"Of course it is."

The guard didn't really have a response for that. He couldn't hear any tell tale noises of windows or doors in the library that would suggest an escape was happening but he was nevertheless starting to consider just bowling this small woman over.

"Why do you think it isn't?" The librarian pressed.

"I do not have time for this. You're a library. You don't have a god, you have books."

One of the other librarians had come back to the main entrance now, hovering behind the head librarian uneasily. He did not look armed or even confident but something about the way his eyes flitted between the guard and the head librarian suggested that he would back her up no matter what.

The head librarian herself barely seemed phased by the escalating tension. She adjusted her stance slightly but still stood firm.

"A god is not the only thing that makes a place holy. The druids don't have a god and yet their temples are places of sanctuary."

The guard stepped as close as he physically could to the librarian without knocking her aside.

"That's a place of worship. They have faith and rituals and all of that. This isn't any of that and you know it. Stand aside."

The head librarian could surely feel the guard's breath on her forehead he was looming so closely over her. Yet she merely tilted her face upwards so that her eyes still met his and told him-

"No."

As he reached for his weapon she continued.

"We are a temple of knowledge. How can you say we have no ritual when every day we arrange these books so lovingly into a precise order? How can you say this place houses no worship when every last one of us can name at least a handful of books we have cared for as much as a child, a god or a friend? How can you say we have no faith when our passion to seek out and provide knowledge is more devout than the acts of any monk."

The other librarian reached under the desk but before the guard had time to react he'd already seen that what the man had pulled out was not a weapon but a small and worn leather bound book. He shrugged almost apologetically as he placed it into his jacket pocket.

"If this is going to end in bloodshed and I have to die then I would rather die with my favourite words close to my heart."

*Who were these people?*

"It doesn't have to. Just move aside now and I won't have to hurt any of you! This isn't a place of worship, this is just *books!*"

The head librarian shook her head slowly and the guard could swear that the man behind her chuckled quietly.

"This is a temple of knowledge, not paper. I have given you more than enough argument to justify why taking that child would be unlawful and if you try then I *will* stop you for as long as I'm still breathing. Not because I care about him but because nobody storms the house of my faith uninvited."

She leant forward and without thinking the guard shuffled back. Flustered, he loosened his sword from its hilt. Nobody else came close to drawing a weapon in response.

"Of course," the head librarian continued, "neither the illegality of entering nor how difficult it would be for you to overpower us should be your main concern. Over the years we have offered our knowledge to hero and criminal alike without judgement. We have dispensed information that saves lives and have even both found and provided texts that averted a war. If you kill us, which is the only way you are going to make your way in here, then you will suddenly find you have many enemies.

Every herbalist in the city visits here regularly and has borrow books on both cures and poisons. Their intentions were purely to make sure that harmful plants are never mistakenly given out instead of their similar looking and beneficial cousins but there are other uses for books on poisons. Some of your coworkers, friends and family may have been here searching for answers about sensitive matters I will never reveal to you. And they may not be best pleased to learn that you decided to hurt us just to arrest some child.

And that isn't even counting the librarian who isn't working here today or the scholars who regularly help out. They know the passions and secrets of everyone who walk through those doors as well as half the knowledge in the books we house. There is frankly no aspect of your comfortable life that they could not destroy within a week."

The head librarian stepped forward again and the guard stepped back through the threshold as he fully sheathed his sword.

"You're right," the head librarian said as she began to close the door, "we don't have a god."

The smile she gave to the guard before she closed the door in his face would haunt him for some months later, as would the last thing she said.

"But we don't need one."
