I am the eldest of three children and I am easily the biggest disappointment. My sister Erzebeth is a fighter. She started out as a low level mercenary but as time went on she found herself on more perilous quests and her skill level grew nearly exponentially. There are tales sung of her in taverns across the realm and she is rumoured to have once slain three men with a single stroke of her axe. And knowing her, I believe those rumours completely. 

Some of these tales are sung by my only brother, Anton. Always a musical child, Anton set out to the Bards College at a young age and swiftly graduated - though perhaps not as swiftly as if he'd spent a little less time having fun. Instead of merely having a pleasant voice and being a skilled lute player, his song could inspire and enchant. He bridges the gap between mage and entertainer and is as welcome in any court as in any adventuring party.

My final sibling is the one you won't have heard of - and I can say that with confident certainty. Elsie doesn't want anyone to know her name. A deadly rogue, she regularly claims that "notoriety is for amateurs and corpses" and doesn't feel the need to let her reputation precede her. Despite this, she has carried out many high profile assassinations (though some still aren't known to be the result of foul play even to this day) and has stolen information and treasures alike.

Then there's me. I garden. And that's it. I grow pumpkins that I can just about make soup out of and tomatoes that are regularly squished by adventurers far too important to look where they're going. And yes, I've put up signs. Nice hefty wooden signs at that. Even so, adventurers run through my garden with alarming regularity and that is how the trouble started.

I wasn't even outside when I killed Owain Elderfire. I was making myself a quick bite to eat when suddenly I felt a cold, tingling rush. My brain fizzed and my vision seemed to momentarily tighten in focus. Even though I had not previously felt this before I recognised the feeling from tales - I, Patricia the Gardener, had just levelled up. Of course, I didn't have more than a moment to ponder it when the screaming started.

I wasn't judged to be maliciously at fault but I was certainly judged. I suddenly wasn't invited to village gossip and I was smart enough to understand that was because I was now the source of the gossip. I kept a brave face in public but at night I was inconsolable. Only I knew that his death had made me level up, you see. At least until my siblings answered my frantic, mage-sent messages to come home.

That Elsie was first home wasn't surprising but was also good fortune on my part as I'd wanted to speak to her first. I led her to the site of the accident - the only part of my garden I hadn't touched since it happened. I gestured at the area, on the verge of tears. Quietly, almost studiously, she examined the broken twine and crushed plants.

"It doesn't look like a trap. It also wouldn't be a very effective one. I'm sure it's excellently suited to whatever plant this is, but it'd be a shoddy way to murder someone. So no, I don't think you levelled up because you're a murderer now. Not to mention - nobody can *accidentally* become a rogue."

Elsie hugged me and it was awkward but genuine. 

"I guess at least the way you ended up tripping him meant it saved more of your garden that if he'd raced through at least." She said and though I knew she was trying to make light of the situation it made me feel even worse.

Fortunately, my other siblings arrived before I had time to dwell further on my not quite a murder. Anton had managed Erzebeth to carry him towards the house - a skill he had found amusing and impressive as a teenager and apparently still did as an adult.

"Aren't you a bit old for that?" I yelled over at him.

"Please! If it wasn't for my sweet talking a guard into letting us use a teleportation circle for free we'd still be two days away. The least this heap of muscle can do is ever so briefly carry me," Anton said before getting down from Erzebeth's shoulder of his own volition and adding, "so anyway - is this the scene of the crime?"

Anton only meant it to be cheeky but I had been thinking I was a murderer for over a week and I suddenly started crying over it. Not just crying either but bawling. None of my siblings had ever been amazing at being comforting but to their absolute credit each one of them used that moment to at least try their best, all speaking simultaneously.

"I didn't mean *crime* crime-" Anton desperately tried to clarify.

"It made her level up but I've been telling her-" Elsie explained.

"There there. I have brought home a pie we can eat." Erzebeth offered, perhaps the most confusing attempt to console me but a heartfelt one nonetheless.

"Maybe you really levelled up because of these mushrooms you grew here?" Anton suggested then suddenly his tone became more intense. "Wait, Pat. How did you grow these mushrooms here? These are forestbreath mushrooms. They shouldn't grow to this size outside of dense forests. The only ones I've seen this good have been preserved samples when I was working at the Mages College."

"I just moved things around a few days ago. I took a couple of those mushrooms from the forest and they were weedy but I knew if I put them next to the tomatoes they'd be stronger." I said, getting calmer the more I talked about the mushrooms.

"Pat- these are really valuable."

Between us, we realised that every change in the garden since I'd levelled up had optimised things to a ridiculous degree. I knew which things were herbs, vegetables or poisonous but Elsie could tell me which poisons could be used to coat a dagger or slip into a drink whereas Anton could tell me which ones were popular with mages. I described the changes I'd made to the garden and ones I wanted to make still and my thoughts about cross breeding common herbs for more unusual results. Erzebeth slunk off and at first I thought she felt left out but she later returned with a wheelbarrow filled with heavy rocks.

"For the spiral herb bed you mentioned." She explained simply.

Later that night as we ate the previously promised pie together none of us were entirely certain why I had levelled up. My newly improved skills were in no way directly related to adventurer murdering so why now? The best we could figure out was that it was the act of protecting the garden, rather than the death itself, which prompted the change.

No matter what the exact cause though one thing became clear  - gardeners certainly can level up. And as my talents now have potential uses to every class out there it will be extremely exciting to see where the next few levels take me.
