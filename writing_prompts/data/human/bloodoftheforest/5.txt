Amy died on a brisk October morning with her cup of coffee only half finished. A carer came in to check on her twenty three minutes after her death and alerted both the emergency services and her family. Though her life had been painful in her last few years, her death was blessedly sudden. All in all, Amy Stubbs had died more peacefully than she had lived.

But that's only the story of what happened to Amy's body.

Her soul was quite another matter.

-----

Amy sat up and reached for her cup of coffee and was surprised when her fingers slipped right through it. Then she saw the motionless arm in her bed and though she was alarmed at first she realised what had happened really quite quickly.

"Oh." She said.

Mesmerised by the sight of her own empty body it took Amy a good minute to realise that she was being watched. The figure in the corner was otherworldly but felt as familiar as an old friend.

"You get one game." The figure's voice echoed.

Amy smiled.

"Yeah, I know. It's in films and stuff, did you know that? I win a game against you and I get to live."

"One year," Death clarified, "it only extends your life by one year."

"And I can choose any game I like, right? Chess or the beer can game or, I don't know, croquet or whatever?"

Death nodded at Amy's question as she slowly stood from the bed.

"Not that I'd choose croquet, haha! I've never even seen croquet... No, I'd choose the duel mode of Awoken."

The room that Amy had previously been in faded away and the two were in a bright, formless space with two video consoles waiting by comfortable looking chairs. Amy smiled sadly and shook her head.

"No, I mean I *would* choose that. If I wanted to play. I forfeit."

There was an uncomfortable pause.

"You don't want to play against me?" Death asked. "You understand that there is no other way to gain your extra year?"

Amy sank into one of the comfortable chairs and sighed.

"Hey, that's two different questions. I'd love to play video games with you, I really would. My hands haven't been dextrous enough to hold a controller in years. But that's kind of my point. I haven't been able to stand in months, my body won't do what I tell it to, everything just hurts.

"I've had a good life, I think. Found people who loved me, lost some of them. Caused some trouble but against the right kinda people. But it ended and that's fine with me. I'm done."

The silence was stark. There was no background noise in this place, no chattering of humans or echoing of wind. The clock in the hall outside Amy's room had bothered her slightly for the entire time she'd been in the care home. It's ticking couldn't reach her here and despite the circumstances she still enjoyed it's absence.

"Are you good?" Death asked.

"I guess I'd like to think so? I wasn't perfect but I wasn't evil and I alw-"

"No," Death interrupted, "Are you good at that 'Awoken' game?"

Amy smiled.

"Oh, I was *excellent.* Back when my hands were like this and not those hopeless things I left on my bed I dominated in this! Hell, if we were doing this life game thing then I even think I'd have won."

The controller in front of Amy was undoubtedly the exact one she used to have. There was even a faded sticker next to the left trigger button.

"You probably could have." Death said.

Amy heard what he'd said but was paying more attention to the objects he'd given her. The chair and screen were from her past too. She brushed her fingers along the leather when Death spoke again.

"Teach me."

This caught her attention. Of all of the things that had happened to her in this bizarre day, this was the one that surprised Amy most.

"Aren't you just meant to whisk me off somewhere now? What do you mean teach you? Why?"

"You said yourself that you're better at this than me. These games for extended life are supposed to be almost impossible. There are no tricks but I never meant for this to be easy. But then video games were created and there was a type of game I could barely win and some people choose them over and over again.

I refuse to go back on my word. I will continue to allow those who win to live one extra year. But it should be difficult. Some of these people fear me so much that they'd win every year for an eternity if I would let them."

Amy nodded.

"I understand. This just... this isn't what I thought would happen."

"You won't help me?"

"No, no. I didn't say that. It's just not what I thought would happen."

Death approached Amy and turned the chairs to face each other with a quick flick of his sleeve. He sat on the other chair and although he was now so much nearer to her, Amy still couldn't see any discernible features beyond Death's long cloak.

"There would be advantages. I go everywhere. You could see anywhere in the world, you could see things no other human is even able to."

A look of sadness flickered over Amy's face briefly but she did her best to hide it.

"You know, I really have travelled. I know there's always more but... that wasn't exactly what I thought I'd get to see."

Something shifted and the white space they'd been in suddenly gained details. It was the house where Amy had spent the best years of her life. The second place she'd lived after marrying...

"You're here!" May squealed ecstatically, wrapping her arms around Amy so tightly that it almost hurt.

"I mean..." May added, thinking about it for a second, "should I be sorry? Are you okay? I mean I know you're dead but are you... um.. fine with it?"

Amy freed herself from the hug only to get a better look at May. She was younger than Amy had last seen her and she looked healthy. But as she examined her own hands Amy realised that the same was probably true for them both.

"I don't understand." Amy said, turning to look at Death, "I agreed to help you. I thought that meant that I couldn't be here?"

Death gestured to the console in the corner of the room.

"I saw no reason that you couldn't be. I can be here just as easily as anywhere else. I'll return in one week for my first lesson."

He was gone in an instant and Amy looked at her wife with wonder.

"Oh, I have so much to tell you..."
