If there's one thing our town knows, it's that Winnifred Dunn is not guilty.

A small town like this and even if you don't know someone directly, you'll surely know somebody who does. Still, I think a good number of this would have known Winnie even if this wasn't the case. She was a good kid, a weird kid but a good kid. Maybe got into some mischief but never any trouble. Sweet and respectful unless you ever gave her reason not to be. Loud but courteous, funny but never cruel.

I lived two doors down from Winnie so I'd known her since before she could walk but when her occasional babysitting led to tutoring and finally leading whole study groups one subjects supposedly two whole years too advanced for her - well, then everyone know about her. It's kinda strange maybe, how when a town is small enough it can end up almost being an extended family. We were all rooting for her to do well and when she got a scholarship to study robotic engineering at a fancy university we were all proud.

Winnie had to move back home two years ago when her father got too ill to take care of himself. I can't really imagine what she gave up to do that, though I know that she wouldn't have had it any other way. I popped in on them on a few occasions - checking if she needed anything from the store since I was driving out anyway bringing around cookies when my wife had 'made too many', that sort of thing. Similar sort of stuff she'd done for me when she was just a teenager and I'd gone through a rough patch. She looked tired and it saddened me to see her that way.

One time I'd gone around because she'd promised to help me with a weird issue my phone had been having and the living room floor was covered in bits of gizmos. In between making us both tea and fixing my phone, Winnie explained that she was making robots. She said she'd been having trouble sleeping in case her father needed her at night but that these robots should be able to help him with any minor issues or wake her if need be. When I whistled through my teeth at the gadgetry Winnie had just laughed it off and said that every last one of the components had been cannibalised from electronic devices already in the house. She hadn't had the money to order anything in, she said, so she'd had to get creative.

I chatted to Winnie a few times about her robots before the arrest. She explained to me about the new AI system she'd given them so they could better understand what how to help her father. Just giving them access to a medical textbook would seem to be best but real life is a lot more nuanced than that. Say a medicine says it should be taken three times a day but if the robots gave him that many then funds wouldn't last the month - a robot with a dynamic AI would be able to work out which medications could stand to only be given twice a day. 

When Winnie was arrested, a police officer came around my house to question us. I was stony faced whilst my wife glared daggers at them and the useless bastard didn't even know where to look.

"Are you aware of any illegal activity that Winnifred Dunn might have been involved in?" He asked us both.

"No."

"Even if you haven't seen anything directly, if there is anything that hints about the kind of-"

"Look, officer, what exactly are you even accusing poor Winnie of?" My wife asked sternly.

He shuffled in his seat.

"We have reason to believe that Miss Dunn might have been involved in various crimes including illegal gambling, bank robbery-"

"*Bank robbery?*" I asked incredulously. "She's a tiny little woman and she doesn't even own a gun. How would she go about robbing a bank?"

"Witnesses claim that the robbery was undertaken by robots which may or may not resemble those at the Dunn household."

"So your whole lead is just that there were robots there? Not even necessarily ones which look like Winnie's?"

"Additionally, the timing of these crimes roughly coincided with large medical bills assigned to Miss Dunn's father being paid off."

"Is that so? Well, I can solve that mystery right now for you. I gave her the money. Likely not all of it, but I knew that she was in a bad spot and so I helped her out."

"We don't have kids of our own," my wife added, "but Winnie has always felt like family to us."

"She's a lovely young woman, wouldn't even surprise me if we weren't the only ones in town who did so." I finished.

The officer looked flustered at that.

"Do you have statements that can corroborate that?" He asked.

"I do indeed. And whilst usually I'd demand you get a warrant just to waste your time like you've wasted mine, if it'll get Winnie home faster then I can have that information sent over this afternoon."

We both kept to our word and Winnie was home before sunset, cleared of any suspicion of wrongdoing. She thanked me profusely for all of my help but I did what anyone would have done in that situation, I think.

See, Winnie didn't rob any banks but the idea that her robots did... well, there might be a little truth to that. She hadn't told them to and was hysterical when she found out - so hysterical, in fact, that she told me the whole thing in floods of tears. Whilst it was their AI that led the robots to steal and gamble to get Winnie enough money for her dad and no sort of direct instruction, under the letter of the law she was just as guilty as if she'd done it herself. 

I told her I didn't give a damn if she'd told them every last detail, saving her father was the moral thing to do and all I wanted to know was how could I help. So we concocted a plan and the money the robots got from their various activities went to any number of people in this town, sometimes changing hands again before it ever reached Winnie and then finally paid off one of Mr Dunn's extortionate medical bills.

Everyone in this town knows that Winnifred was involved in some criminal activities.

It's just that none of us think that's quite the same as her being guilty.
