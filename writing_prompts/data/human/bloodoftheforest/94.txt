We heard the first note on the eighteenth of July and it was surely no coincidence that only one week prior we had caught a traitor in our midst. Women are bad luck on perilous voyages and as such we have never permitted them on our vessel. Last week however, we found that one of our newest sailors was in fact merely pretending to be male. How she had concealed this from us for an entire month would be a matter of fierce debate if the situation was not so dire. 

As soon as we found out the truth we bound her and though we kept her aboard for one more day we knew what we must do. She told us sorrowful tales of escaping from terrible situation from her city but none of us found sympathy for the witch who had the potential to doom us all. She stopped begging as we dragged her to the side of the ship, perhaps muted by terror. She screamed as we threw her overboard but the ropes around her wrists and ankles meant that the commotion was brief. We prayed that night, not for her soul but for our own.

The cabin boy was the first to hear the note and as he told the rest of the crew our hearts sunk one by one. Ending that woman had not been enough to stop her from drawing curses towards us, her selfishness had caused the sea itself to notice our presence. I consulted our map and made orders to change course to the nearest land available. We could only hope it would not be too late.

When women draw the sea's curse to a ship the precise omens can vary. Most often, stories tell of increasingly hostile weather - storms, unnatural waves or sudden changes in the wind. Strangely, when we had found the truth about Susan the weather was milder than usual. Almost pleasant, in fact. It just goes to show that the ways in which women can bring about curses of the sea are as varied as they are deadly.

The change in course was simple enough to accomplish but before we were even fully finished in deciding what to do the note became more varied and was joined by others. A beautiful melody that seemed to come from all sides of the boat at once.  I screamed out orders to direct the ship away from the singing but of course, not a one of us could truly tell which direction it was coming from.

As the singing grew louder I began to be able to hear the shapes of the words. Someone had changed the ship's course again, presumably in an effort to avoid these sirens. Because at this point there could be no doubt that this is where the voices were coming from. We couldn't see them at this point but we had all heard tales and there could be no other explanation a reasonable man would offer.

Latin. The shapes of the words sounded as though they were Latin. The strange thing is that even though I didn't learn a lick of it and had only ever heard snatches of the languages I had no trouble understanding the meanings of the words.

*We are just, we are loving, we have mercy..*

The ship jolted suddenly and somewhere in the back of my mind I understood that we had hit rocks. The voices were so much louder now, closer too. I was no longer afraid and I believed the voices completely. I steadied myself and began to walk closer so as to be able to see one of the sirens.

*we are just, we are loving, we have mercy..*

I heard screams but I found myself both unwilling and unable to care. It couldn't have been anything important, I reasoned. A minor injury perhaps.

*we are just, we are loving, we have mercy..*

The angle of the ship meant I could not clearly see the siren without climbing out. This was not a normal angle for the ship to be at and we must have hit the rocks more severely than I'd first realised. A part of me was aware that the ship must have been seriously damaged but this didn't seem to matter too terribly. I pulled myself up to the side of the ship-

*we are just, we are loving, we have mercy..*

-and then allowed myself to crash down into the water below. My leg managed to hit something, either part of the ship or a rock that was above the sea itself, and then I sunk into the water below.

*we are just, we are loving, we have mercy..*

I came up for air spluttering and though I knew there were rocks nearby I struggled to find them. I tried to tread water but with my leg so injured I found it increasingly difficult to keep my head above the waves.

*we are just, we are loving, we have mercy..*


Finally I saw the siren. Gorgeous and terrifying, her body covered in nothing but scales. Her nails were long talons and her teeth were sharp points but the words of her song promised kindness. I found Susan cradled in her arms and to my amazement and wonder not only was Susan alive but her own body was beginning to develop shimmering scales like those of the siren that held her. The siren looked at Susan with love and wonder before pausing her singing, allowing the choir to go on without her. I could still hear the song of the others as the siren in front of me turned her gaze from Susan to myself. I reached out my arms for her assistance.

*we are just, we are loving, we have mercy..*


"But not for you." The siren spoke and suddenly her voice took up a pure and mournful wail.

With the change in song I began to panic as I realised that no help was coming. The pain in my leg that I had barely registered before blossomed and grew, and I realised it was surely broken. My mind replayed the sights and sounds of my other crew mates leaping from the ship, things that had seemed so petty in the rapture of the earlier song. My lips tasted salt as I tried to kick with my one good leg and tried to scream as if anyone could hear me.

I sank slowly and fitfully and the last thing I saw was an image of Susan, as she opened her mouth and began her first true song.
