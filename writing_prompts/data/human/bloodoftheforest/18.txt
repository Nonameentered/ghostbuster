Uncle Jerry was an eccentric, an amusing bastard and a millionaire a few times over but if you'd actually asked him what he considered himself to be then he'd say that he was a creative. So really we should have seen this coming.

"I'm sorry, it goes to who?" Esme asked.

All of us, lawyer included, knew that she'd heard the question. I personally was just trying to stifle a laugh.

"It goes to the person who gives the best eulogy." The lawyer repeated.

"That doesn't... best how?"

The lawyer shook his head at this.

"I'm not at liberty to say. I have been given a list of judging criteria but he specifically said not to inform anyone until after the funeral." The lawyer said and began to collect his things.

"Wait!" Esme exclaimed before the lawyer could make his exit. "Best eulogy out of who? Who's allowed to give an eulogy? All of the family or only the closest relatives or..?"

The lawyer shrugged, his professionalism slipping.

"It says 'funeral goer' and he gave no further detail on that point so anyone who goes to the funeral. It doesn't have to be a friend or family member, I suppose it doesn't even technically need to be somebody who's invited just as long as they turn up."

The lawyer left and when I saw Esme's face I had to literally pinch myself to stop from laughing. Jack leaned over.

"I told you this would be worth coming to." He whispered.




There were six of us in the room for the reading of Jerry's will: Esme (his daughter), Patty (his wife), Mike (his dad), Lilly (his sister, my mother) and finally Jack and I (his niece and nephew). My father had not been invited for some unknown reason and Jerry's mother had not been invited for the very known reason that she's dead. Jack had given me an edible in order to make the event half way bearable and that, combined with the absurdity of the situation, meant that I couldn't look around the room to see everyone's reactions for fear of bursting into hysterical laughter.

"Well, he must have had some sort of mental issue none of us had known about." Esme said, her voice filled with fake sympathy. "I suppose it's up to us to do the right thing. It's obviously *meant* to go to me and if there's only one eulogy, there's an automatic winner. So out of respect for the-"

"There's no reason to assume you'd have it. I have more of a right to it than you." Patty said tersely, prompting a snort from Mike.

"If you have a right to it, any of us do." Mike said with a hard glare.

Now this was the sort of petty bullshit I'd been expecting. Neither Esme nor Patty had lived with Jerry, though both had benefitted enormously from his fortune. Patty lived a good two hours away but was still his wife, not his ex-wife. Their relationship had been the weird sort of on again off again rubbish that's more common in high school so Mike's point that almost any of us had an equal right to the money was sort of true.

My mum was fishing keys out of her jacket pocket as the inevitable arguments started.

"Come on, let's go home."



Dad asked how it had gone pretty much as soon as mum walked through the door but she gave him her best 'don't even ask' look and then promptly burst into tears.

"He died and they're just *fighting*!"

While dad hugged mum and led her to the couch Jack and I went to make her some tea.

"Who do you think'll win?" Jack asked, the humour in the situation somehow drained away by the sound of sobs in the next room.

"Eugh. Probably Patty. Esme if she can arrange some underhanded shit that means neither Patty, Mike nor you could come." Jack raised his eyebrow at this so I broke it down. "Patty's an actress she's not exactly terrible so she's the top contender. Esme might try and, I dunno, get people arrested or banned from the venue or something. But if not then she kinda sucks at stuff like this. For someone as desperate for attention as she is, she's bland as uncooked oats. You tell a decent story and Mike's pretty funny if he's in the right mood."

Jack's face suddenly darkened.

"That isn't fair. None of those people *loved* him. Listen to that," he said, nodding at the wall separating us and mum, "she loved him and instead your most likely contenders are people who just saw him as some sort of ATM."

I looked at the floor awkwardly.

"It's not that I think they deserve it. It's just that Mum doesn't do public speaking and I'm not much better. So they'll probably 'win' but it'll be okay. We'll be okay."

"No." My brother muttered. "No, they acted like petty vultures right after his death in front of someone who obviously cared about him. I'm not going to let them win."

"How would you even be able to stop them?" I asked.

"By being pettier."
