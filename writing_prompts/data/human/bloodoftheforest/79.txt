"You can't go out there!" Ian said frantically as I headed towards the kitchen.

"You know I have no say in this." I replied.

My largest chef's knife sat gleaming on the counter. I picked it up and gave it an experimental *swoosh*. Partially satisfied I sheathed it in what had once been a gardening belt and headed to the front door.

"No." Ian said, trying his best to block the doorway. "You can't do this!"

I understood where he was coming from but we were fresh out of alternatives. I moved to grab the baseball bat but then paused. I doubted I'd be able to carry it during the task ahead. If the worst came to the worst, it'd be better to run inside. If things got even more dire than that, at least I'd have the knife.

"Look, I don't even hear the undead right now. I'll be careful, you know I will. If I see or hear anything I'll run straight for the door. You can man the door and let me in, make sure not a single second is wasted. But for all we know, it might be fine."

Ian didn't say anything but instead slumped to the side, defeated. If he hadn't injured his leg so badly he'd have done this for me in a heartbeat but as it was, we both knew it would be too unsafe. I tried to flash a smile, hating how unsteady it was.

"It'll be okay, I'll be okay. But I have to mow our lawn."

Ian tried one last argument.

"Maybe we could wait a week, it's barely too long."

"No, honey. Tammy *measured* it. If I don't trim that grass today then our property is no longer under the protection of the HOA guards. Do you think we could handle that? I need to do this to keep us all safe. 

"*All of us.*" I repeated, glaring meaningfully down at the bat Ian leant on.

It was a cheap tactic, but it worked. Ian shifted his grip on our son's baseball bat, a bat that already seen more violence than actual baseballs. As guilty as it made him feel, Ian knew that this was our best chance of having a home Brandon could be almost safe in right now.

"I swear this is just revenge for the potato salad incident." Ian growled as he slumped to the side.

I sighed and unlocked the door cautiously.

"Yeah, probably. But once I've got this out of the way I have a plan to deal with that bitch. My grass might nearly be too long but let's wait and see how she keeps control of the HOA once her own front lawn is fucking *dead.*"

Knife, check. Lawn mower key, check. Spray bottle of weed killer, check.

Time to go.
