That's very interesting. I don't have prosopagnosia but I'm terrible with faces and I suppose it made me wonder that if somebody could barely remember any faces, would there ability to recognise the uncanny valley effect be limited? Whilst it's a shame that my premise was flawed I really appreciate the feedback and the idea that you would perhaps be less able to recognise an army of clones is at least as intriguing as an army of uncanny valley type people so thank you very much for replying.
