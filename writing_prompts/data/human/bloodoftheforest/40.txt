I'd driven Steven to the airport with nothing but smiles and excitement but as soon I'd hugged him goodbye and he'd hurried away to catch his plane, my face had fallen. This was fairly likely to be the end of my friendship with Steven. He was off on a round the world adventure and since he would have no way of affording both his share of the rent and travel expenses, we were now officially no longer housemates.

Lives taking different paths doesn't necessarily mean a friendship was over, of course. It's possible that he would find time to stay in touch or that he'd get back in touch once he was back in the country. However, it did give me a natural way to disappear on him, possibly without him ever even noticing. Which, much as I didn't want to ghost a genuinely awesome friend, was definitely my plan.

Being immortal is tricky but that my appearance looks 'early twenties' at the absolute oldest is a more significant problem. If I looked 40 then I could potentially begin friendships by saying I was late thirties and maybe get through over ten years before the difference between the age I appear and I age I claim to be is seen as suspicious. As it is, I rotate friends at about a maximum of every five years.

I got home and if I hadn't lived with someone for so long I might have heard the occasional rustle and shuffle from the living room. As it was, I wasn't particularly used to hearing silence in my own home. In the kitchen, I also managed to totally miss the fact that the kettle was ever so slightly warm and boiled a little too quickly. I was looking at my phone as I walked over to the living room and that I felt a breeze come through from a window I barely ever open only really struck me once I'd already entered.

"Jesus Christ!" I exclaimed at the woman slouched on my sofa.

"No," she said slowly, "my name's Emily. Em-i-ly. Have you forgotten already?"

Usually when people think they recognise me (or that I must be their old friend's sister or occasionally even daughter) I end up doing a series of quick calculations in my head. Did they know me for a long time? The less well someone knew me first time around, the easier it is to just insist I'm someone else. Is this stumbling upon them a situation that is unlikely to happen again? There are far fewer risks to agreeing who I am in a crowded bar than something harder to get out of, like a military deployment. The biggest question is generally 'how long ago did I last see this person?' A year is very low risk, ten years is way too risky and anything in between means I judge it off other factors.

All of these calculations apparently go out of the window when the answer to the 'how long ago' question is about 236 years ago.

My mouth opened and closed without managing to form any words as she arched her eyebrow at me in amusement. I had so many questions. Too many, really. I swallowed hard and tried to get my thoughts in order as she slurped loudly from my bright red mug. How did she find me? Why did she find me? How wasn't she dead?

I tried to decide which question I needed to lead with a coughed twice before finally speaking.

"I see you've made yourself some tea."

*What? No, stupid. That's not what I should have said.* I tried again.

"How did you find me?" I asked.

"You went back, for the anniversary. I saw you but I guess I was in too much shock to actually follow you."

"That was 36 years ago though."

"Yes," she said, "but then more recently you've been looking for a housemate, haven't you?"

Even though it wasn't his fault, I cursed Steven under his breath for posting on his social media that his excellent housemate would be wanting somebody new to live with. Still...

"How did you even find that post though?" I asked only to have Emily shake her head at me as she drew herself up straighter.

"Maybe we'll get to that later. Who's this?" She pointed to a photo of Steven and me near the TV. "Do you intend on abandoning him too? Or was his little trip away just the excuse you needed?"

I couldn't answer that. Either she knew because she did the same thing or she was rightfully furious at me for leaving her.

"Does he know?" Emily asked and when the silence dragged on too long she added. "Has anyone known? Ever?"

"Come on," I whispered. "Who could I really tell?"

"Me! You could have told me! You could have done anything but left!"

The mug of tea was empty at this point but Emily was clinging to it so hard that her knuckles were going white. 

"I thought we were friends..." she whispered.

I didn't know if it was better to approach her or give her space so I merely swayed in awkward indecision.

"We were, Emily. We were. But we were accused of witchcraft and I didn't know that any of us aside from me were anything other than normal, human women. I knew I couldn't die so I wasn't scared of that but I thought if I was found guilty and they realised they couldn't kill me, that'd be all the confirmation they needed to find us all guilty."

Emily was crying, but trying not to.

"You know that they took you running away as proof of our collective guilt instead though?"

"Yes. I didn't know until a long while afterwards but-"

"Because you never came back," Emily interrupted.

"No," I said, finally out of excuses, "I didn't. When you saw me there, that was the first time I'd returned."

The silence was painful but I deserved it. After a few minutes had passed I spoke up again.

"You didn't tell me either. If I'd known you were immortal too then-"

"I'm not immortal." Emily said quietly.

"But it said they executed you all and, well..."
I trailed off.

"That's just not the kind of thing that kills me." She said, clarifying absolutely nothing.

I finally joined Emily on the sofa and to my surprise she rested her head on my shoulder.

"Did you like him?" She asked, gesturing to the photo.

"Er, yes, actually. Good guy. One of the nicest friends I've had in some time. It'll be a shame to let him go."

"Then don't. I think you should tell him."

I winced involuntarily at the idea.

"Hell of a thing to trust someone with. And even if I did, I'd be almost putting him in the same predicament I've been in all this time. He'd either have to hide me away from all my friends so they don't notice the complete lack of ageing on my part or he'd ditch our friendship just to be done with all of the stress."

"Now that, that I can help with," Emily said as she stood up and faced me. "You see, they were actually quite correct about me."

Emily's features shifted and her features gently crinkled like paper into a face that was still her but at least a couple of decades older. She turned a little this way and that so I could definitely see the change in her.

"The rest of us were human, but I really was a witch."

------

Two weeks later, after intensive catching up with the woman I had once believed was a normal human and had known was a good friend, we were on a plane to Tokyo. Destination number one on Steven's round the world adventure and, with any luck, the place were I would tell the second person in my long, long life about my immortality. After all, if immortals are real and witches are real then surely friends who can accept immortals or witches can't be that outlandish?

Wish me luck.
