"Won't be long now, I'm just waiting for my partner to get here." Smith said, smiling apologetically at the handcuffed teen in front of him.

Good cop bad cop is the oldest trick in the book and so well known that even though Smith hadn't met Jones before he'd confidently been able to announce "you be bad cop - see you there in five!" with the knowledge that Jones would know exactly what was expected of him.

Sure it had been ten minutes now, not five, but that would be fine, right? 

The door slammed open and Smith sighed in silent relief. Jones stormed through, walked up to the perp and announced-

"Sorry, I lost the files on the way here."

Smith blinked in confusion. He had given Jones the files mere minutes ago, and even if Jones had been so wildly incompetent as to lose them, that would be something to quietly tell Smith - not something to announce to the suspected thief in front of them.

Jones turned around to Smith and winked confidently.

"I guess I was just concentrating too hard on the sandwich I was having for lunch." Jones said. "I might have even put it in one of the boxes to be archived. If so, I guess we'll never see it again."

It was at this point that Smith began to panic. Either Jones had actually lost the files, which was terrible, or he was lying and this was the worst interview ever. They didn't have enough to make a conviction stick without some level of a confession - so far everything could be explained away as purely circumstantial. They didn't necessarily need a full and complete confession but at least one minor slip up or something.

"You know, I'm not even sure I got down the details right from the first theft anyway. She was so dull right?" Jones exclaimed, settling comfortably on the chair. "And to be totally honest I'm not sure I was all there anyway, I'd just smoked a truly excellent-"

"JONES!" Smith yelled, suddenly jolting forward to grab Jones's shoulders. "I just, um, we just need a quick chat outside."

Smith dragged Jones out of the interrogation room and the door hadn't even clicked shut before he began yelling.

"What the fuck was that Jones?! Do you even know what bad cop means?"

Jones cocked his head to one side.

"Sure, it's like, a cop that's bad at his job, right?"

Smith brought his hands to his temples in frustration.

"It's meant to mean a bad cop. Like he might fuck someone up or something."

"I'm meant to break the law?" Jones asked, bemused.

"No, of course not. I mean, it's more strict." Smith attempted to clarify, wondering how Jones could possibly be unfamiliar with the term.

"I mean we're cops man, this is pretty strict. I don't really-"

"Intimidating!" Smith said somewhat desperately. "You're just meant to be intimidating. No direct threats, nothing illegal, just intimidating."

Jones nodded confidently and headed back in with Smith following.

"Hey punk," Jones began promisingly, "if you don't tell the truth guess what I'm going to do?"

Jones scowled almost convincingly in the perp's face but all the kid did was grin.

"What? What exactly are you going to do?"

Jones matched the kid's grin with his own and brought his face so close that it was almost touching. He was leaning so far forward that his hands were on the table to support him. Then, confidently, he tilted his face downwards and licked the table once.

"Tell us." Jones said, looking back at the perp.

"Wait, what?"

Displeased with this insufficient answer, Jones stood back up and headed to one end of the table and then licked the entire length of the thing, from one end to the other. Smith was speechless behind him and the teen was pulling as far away from the situation as his cuffs allowed.

"Tell us!" Jones bellowed after he had finished with the table.

"Wait, let's just talk about this man!" The teen said, now thoroughly alarmed.

"NO!" Jones bellowed and then headed to the two way mirror. He'd stood in one corner of the room and licked the wall until he reached the mirror, licked the entire length of the mirror and then followed the wall to the corner. He stopped for a moment, but it seemed that all he was doing was putting his tongue back in his mouth to remoisten it. The tongue squelched back onto the corner of the wall.

"No! I did it! I definitely did it! My phone's got all the incriminating shut you could need on me man, I stashed it under the bin in the alley your guys arrested me in. Go get it. Just, stop." The teen gibbered.

Jones grinned and nodded at the shaky perp.

"I guess I will." He said smugly as he left the room alone.

Smith looked at the teen, thoroughly regretting all of his life choices. He looked at the long smears of saliva on the table and mirror, subconsciously shuddering as he did so. Finally he looked at the door Jones had left through.

"Yeah," Smith muttered to himself, "that guy does not get to be bad cop again."
