(2/2)

In the week leading up to the funeral I learned nothing about Jack's plan, but I did learn bits and bobs about everyone else's. I was trying to help mum as much as I could and so called the funeral director to clarify something about flowers.

"I just think you should perhaps know," he told me, "that the widow and the daughter have both separately asked me if I could change the time or venue without calling other members of the family. I informed them that the will explicitly states that no change to the time or date of the funeral is permitted and that there was nothing I could do. But I thought you should perhaps know."

Esme did try to get Patty arrested as I'd predicted, a fact that neither of them had decided to keep off Facebook. There was then an attempted restraining order and then a final, last ditch attempt from Esme to get Patty sectioned. My mum's Facebook password was easy enough to guess and so I decided to temporarily block the two of them so she didn't have to see their bullshit.

Mike didn't seem to engage in any of this but I learned from one of Esme's Facebook rants that he was planning to speak. How she knew this was beyond me but I figured it was probably true.

I myself had no intentions to try to speak and mum didn't want to either.

"Are you sure you don't want to say anything, regardless of the will?" My dad asked her one night.

"Anything I want to say to him I've probably already said. He knows I cared about him, I hope. Mad bastard."

Dad nodded.

"I just wanted to know you were sure."

"Certain." Mum replied. "And besides, I couldn't even get through my lines in school plays. Can you imagine speaking at this? It's going to be such a fucking circus."

She had no idea.




On the day of the funeral texts came in from both Esme and Patty saying that the service had had to be postponed due to two different emergencies. I intercepted mum's phone before she could read anything they said and switched it off.

"Did you get the texts?" Jack whispered when he came downstairs. "Manipulative bastards."

"Yeah. Mum hasn't seen them though so don't say anything. You ready for your speech?"

Jack looked mildly confused for a second then quickly shook his head.

"Oh! No, I'm not saying anything."

"But I thought you had a plan..."

He examined his tie in the mirror and straightened it up.

"Yeah, I do. But that's not the plan."




I honestly almost expected Esme had hired someone to physically block us from attending the funeral but we got there just fine. We arrived early but Patty and Esme were there earlier, sulking at each other at opposite sides of the room. Two minutes after we arrived Mike joined us and so all family members were present and accounted for.

But then the door opened again.

Two men who looked vaguely familiar walked in talking to each other in hushed, respectful tones and then sat down as if there was nothing unusual about their presence. Then Mike's *ex*-wife walked in and my jaw dropped. But the magic doorway wasn't finished. More people I didn't recognised filed in in a mixture of normal funeral wear, casual clothes and bizarre outfits. By the time the funeral actually started there were at least twenty unexpected guests present.

And every single one of them spoke.

The ex-wife went on some dramatic tirade, a local comedian gave an amusing yet not disrespectful set, an old friend of my uncle reminisced about their school life together. A well known actor gave a surprisingly heartfelt speech crediting my uncle not only with jumpstarting his career but also for setting events in motion that turned his life around. And the woman in the most revealing outfit in the room turned out to be a literal fire eater and gave a short speech whilst juggling lit clubs.

*I* didn't invite these people. *Mum* didn't invite these people. And even if I hadn't been smart enough to make the deduction so obvious a trained hamster could probably manage it, my brother's shit eating grin as he stared at Esme and Patty gave away exactly who *did* invite these people. Maybe it was just how strange the whole thing was or maybe the comedian's set was funnier than I'd given him credit for but at some point mum started laughing through her tears.

To be fair, this was exactly what Jerry would have wanted.



Two days after the longest, weirdest funeral in history my mum received a letter by courier. We'd all been watching TV together when it arrived and when she opened it she gasped.

"What does this mean?!"

I hurried over and saw that she held in one hand a check for an absurd amount of money made out to her and in the other a note which simply said 'Your half, as promised."

"Oh, it arrived." Jack said. "That's sort of connected to what happened at the funeral. I didn't just tell those people the time and place. I made each of them agree that if they were selected as the best eulogy, half of everything goes to you. It's a shame it's not signed, it would have been interesting to learn who was picked."

Mum started crying, but it wasn't from distress or grief this time. It wasn't fully happy but then again it wasn't fully sad either.

"I can't believe you pulled something like that off," I whispered to Jack once we were all sat back down, "you're insane."

"Yeah, I know." He replied. "But so was he."
