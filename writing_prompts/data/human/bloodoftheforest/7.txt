"But what *happens* to them?" Izzy asked and our mother's eyes shot to me first.

*Don't tell her,* my mother's frantic expression implored me but the truth is that I wouldn't have interrupted anyway. I wanted to see what she said, exactly how she was going to dig her way out of this one.

"Look, it doesn't matter. Now let's get your coat on, yeah?"

Ah, deflection. Of course.

"No." Izzy muttered.

It was so quiet that I don't think anyone but me actually heard her. Whether she heard or not my mother definitely continued buttoning her coat as if nothing had happened.

*"I SAID NO!"* Izzy suddenly screamed, jerking out of her coat and throwing it to the floor.

There was a moment of stillness. After a beat my mother tried to put the coat back around Izzy but she shoved it away with an ear splitting shriek.

"Nobody *tells* me anything!" Izzy spat.

"We don't have time. It's dangerous to be outside at night."

"Then we'll stay here until you've told me."

With this, Izzy had unwittingly won. It would have probably been easy to explain to her why we had to stay inside. It was almost impossible to explain why we had to congregate in the Town Hall. There was a stand off and then mother admitted a grudging defeat.

"I'll only tell you once we've gotten there."

"You could have helped me out there."

And I could have, probably. Izzy trusts me. But couldn't mother see that maybe that there was a reason that Izzy trusts me more than her? That even Izzy's failure, outcast, made-the-longlist sister seemed more trustworthy than the woman who raised her.

Izzy was the only reason I had left not to just sit outside one night and wait for the end.

My mother obviously tried to distract Izzy from the previous conversation as soon as we'd checked in at the Hall. But Izzy pressed and we all knew that if she didn't get some answers then she'd pull this same stunt again tomorrow.

A woman sobbed inconsolably in the corner as my mother considered how many lies she could get away with.

"The people left outside get... taken."

"But where?" Izzy asked instantly.

I grinned at the exchange. Given the topic, I'm pretty sure that makes me a terrible person. But I lost my humanity long ago.

"We don't know sweetie. That's why we only leave bad people outside. Somebody has to be taken so all we can do is make sure that all of the good people are protected. So you will always be safe."

"Sometimes they yell." Izzy murmured then spoke up. "Wouldn't it be better to just lock up the person doing the taking?"

I could see in my mother's frantic expression that all of this was taking far too long. The children are supposed to play a 'game' seeing who can sing the best with their ears covered right at the back of the hall. Here in the middle, here without the noise to protect her, Izzy could well hear something worse than singing.

Though evidently she already knew a little about the sounds scheduled tonight anyway.

"He can't be killed," mother said hurriedly and I snorted with as much pain as amusement, "we just can't kill him. Now, go to the back and-"

The murders have always been a vague clockwork - nobody who has been left out there has lasted more than an hour. The elders watch and they listen and if no sound or sight of the night's victim being 'removed' take place why, that's what the longlist is for. People who are not the worst in our community but who will be thrown to the proverbial wolves in order to keep the powerful safe.

The clock in the town hall isn't a true clock but a timer. At the first hint of sunset someone sets it going. It had been going perhaps only five minutes at this point in the conversation. Early for a murder but not impossible, hence our mother's worry over Izzy.

We heard a noise, but it was not the sound of screaming or begging.

No, that night we heard something altogether different.

That night we heard a *knock.*

My mother looked like she might vomit. She was one of the elders too and she looked torn between the duties of the town and her family.

"What if we just all stayed together? Wouldn't we be safe then?" Izzy asked obliviously.

Wordlessly my mother walked towards the front of the hall. Most other adults were making their way towards the back, terrified of the loud, assertive banging on our Town Hall's door.

I took Izzy's hand. If this was the end then she deserved the truth.

"Nobody knows. Everyone was too scared to try."

At the front of the hall, after the third round of knocking, an elder finally spoke.

"Is Caleb not there?" The elder asked weakly. "Do we need, do we need to send another?"

In the pause that followed I wondered if I was finally at the top of the longlist. If so, what a night to finally tell the truth. I released Izzy's hand and told her it would be okay and then put myself between her and the door.

"Caleb is here." A voice replied.

It was strange, finally hearing our bogeyman's actual voice. It was strong and gruff but it sounded human.

"Is he... is he still alive?"

That question had been a lot quieter than the last.

Another round of knocking took place, this time from a window. But when the voice spoke again it came from the door the same as before.

"Caleb is alive."

All of the elders had now climbed up onto the wooden platform above the door. The windows there were clear instead of the decorative glass that adorned the other windows. It was on that platform that night after night our elders had watched for signs of violence.

Another round of knocking. The door and two separate windows, all too far apart for any two to have been hit by the same person.

"You have made a list." The voice said.

More knocking, more sources.

"You saw my evil-"

A cacophony of banging for this round.

"And you chose to commit sins of your own."

Even louder this time, the very walls seemed to shake.

"I think you outmatched me."

There was no more banging but desperate, panicked mutters from the elders. Some of the people inside were crying. The sobbing woman, however, had stopped at the start of this speech.

"We have made our own list now. And it will only take one night."

Nobody could see anything through the door, so perhaps that's why our eyes weren't focussed on it. I myself had been looking at my mother. But the metallic scrape of the Hall's lock made us all stare.

*"IZZY, NO!!!"* my mother screamed as she threw herself down the ladder to the door.

The lock wasn't complicated. Izzy had already finished unlocking it before our cold, hardened mother had even caught sight of her. The doorknob was already turning when she'd hit the floor.

All of a sudden our fates were finally out of our hands in the way we'd always previously claimed they were. And it was only when I heard what Izzy said in the moment before the door flung open that I realised how many she too had lost.

"Maybe their list will be better."
