#Family Squabbles

All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.

In the case of the Lazarus family, any and all unhappiness centred around one thing â€” hunger.

"We need to hunt!" Little Sister insisted. Her eyes burnt with a desperation that the others had learnt not to ignore. They couldn't risk letting her draw attention to them again. Not after the last time.

"And we will," Big Brother replied, tactically positioning himself between her and the crypt door. "But we must be careful about it."

"I'm tired of being careful!"

"Are you tired of being alive, too?"

Middle Brother watched from the sidelines, gaze flicking between his siblings. It was difficult to call who'd win this bout. 

Little Sister showed no signs of backing down, fangs bared and muscles coiled. Her face twisted into a snarl, distorting the many scarlet lines that marred her porcelain skin.

But Big Brother had been at this a lot longer than her. He towered over her, maintaining an aura of calm authority, unblemished face serene but stern.

Though the Lazarus family may not have aged like mortals, they wore the years on their faces in other ways. The carelessness of the first century tended to leave behind a myriad of scars. At one hundred and fifty, everyone had the face that they deserved. After that, most had either learnt to be more careful, or met their final end. The subsequent centuries merely added to the weight worn in their eyes.

But it was different for Little Sister. As the baby of the family, too many allowances had been made. She'd been protected against the consequences of her carelessness for too long.

"You call this living, Big Brother?" she snarled, gesturing around the dilapidated crypt. "We run and hide from those we should hunt and kill! Starving ourselves! Depriving ourselves of every pleasure!"

"It's better than the alternative," he replied, voice dark and low. "I'd have thought that business with the Van Helsing's in Catalonia would have taught you that much."

Ever the peacemaker, Middle Brother stepped forward. "Come now," he said, raising his hands. "Let's not speak of that."

Little Sister rounded on him. "Why not?" she sneered. "Do you *miss* her? You always were a mummy's boy!"

His vision flashed red with anger as he leapt towards her, fists clenched and fangs bared. "You. Stupid. Careless. Child!" he snarled between blows.

But Little Sister only laughed as she dodged and darted away.

"Enough!" Big Brother snapped, hauling them apart. "Mother would not have wanted this for us."

"Mother wouldn't have wanted to die!" Middle Brother whined, struggling in the iron grip that held him. "And she wouldn't have if Little Sister could control herself! She's going to get us all killed!"

"It isn't my fault! She practically threw herself at that stake!"

"To save you!"

"I said enough!" Big Brother pushed them both back, releasing his grip. "Middle Brother is right, Little Sister," he muttered darkly. "We lost everything because of you."

"You lost because you told yourselves you lost!" she sneered. "We escaped not only with our lives but free of Mother's ridiculous rules! From where I stand, that seems like a victory!"

Before either of them could reply, she turned and sprinted out the crypt door, taking off into the night.

"Sorry," Middle Brother muttered. "I shouldn't have let her get to me like that. I just..."

"No," Big Brother said, helping him to his feet. "You were right. She is a danger to us, as well as to herself."

"So what do we do?"

"Give her some time alone in the growlery."

Little Sister returned before dawn, blood dripping down her chin and a myriad of new scratches adorning her face. Her brothers lay in wait for her.

As soon as she came through the door, they each seized an arm. She struggled and screamed and swore as they dragged her toward the open coffin, but her efforts were in vain.

"We're sorry, Little Sister," Big Brother said solemnly. "But this is for your own good." 

"What are you doing?" she snarled, eyes wide with fear. "Please don't! I promise I'll be good!"

"It isn't forever," Middle Brother said. "But you need to learn some patience. We'll exhume you in a decade or two." 

They lowered the lid onto the coffin, and silence descended on the crypt. 

As the adrenaline seeped away, it left room in Middle Brother for loneliness to creep in. First Mother. Then Little Sister. The Lazarus family was shrinking every day.

A firm hand on his shoulder soothed the suffering slightly. He turned to look into his brother's deep, soft eyes filled with centuries of care and concern. At least he wasn't truly alone. He still had Big Brother. He loved Big Brother.
