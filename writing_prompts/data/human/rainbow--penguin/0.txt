I loved this excuse for all the rhyming

> “It’s a management technique from a rival kitchen. Their food is quite bitchin’. 

that made me chuckle.

Also, congrats on rhyming "ingredients" with "expedience". That was *chef's kiss*.

I also enjoyed how the rhyming broke out of the dialogue and into the prose as well. It gave the whole piece a really nice rhythm which matched the fast-paced environment.
