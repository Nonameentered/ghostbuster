Congrats on the spotlight /u/Dacacia! Really enjoyed being introduced to your work outside the couple of flash fiction stories I'd seen.

A couple of questions for you, if that's alright:

1) Do you have a single favourite story of yours? Or one that you think best encapsulates you're writing?

2) What's your favourite part of writing?

3) Do you have any top tips (writing-related or otherwise)?
