Hello! I loved this interpretation of the theme. It was really nice to read an emotive but wholesome and sweet poem.

You have some lovely lines that really capture that feeling. In particular, that middle stanza is just great. In a way, it's bittersweet, but overall it feels like a warm hug.

The only thing that tripped me up a little is the pauses caused by punctuation in some lines not quite matching the rhythm I felt like I wanted (if that makes sense). Particularly in this stanza:

> Is that day far off? Nobody can tell.
>
>Our time is what we make it, memories.
>
>While all things fade, love endures, persists

where all of the lines are interrupted by punctuation, but in different places. It just started to feel a little choppy to me. But that might be me reading it wrong.

Overall I really enjoyed it though. Thanks for writing.
