#A Farewell to Your Past-Self

It was a wrong number that started it, the telephone ringing three times in the dead of night, and the voice on the other end asking for someone he was not.

By the time the sleep had cleared from Grant's mind, the caller had already hung up. Thinking no more of it — other than to hope they'd find 'Matthew' — he stumbled back into bed.

He'd almost forgotten about it entirely when he sat down at his typewriter the next morning, sipping at a cup of Columbian coffee. Grant let himself sink into that rich, nutty scent, as the rhythmic clack of the keys beneath his fingers soothed his soul.

Until his slice of paradise was rudely interrupted by a knock at the door. Grumbling, Grant pushed himself to his feet and shuffled out of his study into the corridor.

The knock came again.

"Alright, alright!" he called. "I'm coming."

Outside his bubble of comfort, it was not a fragrant world. The door swung open onto a street where the musty scent of soot hung in the air, accompanied by the chemical tang of petrol, and a sweet, pungent whiff of ozone.

The face that greeted him on the doorstep was that of a stranger — a woman who couldn't have been much younger than him. Hair that might once have been a luscious chestnut was dulled by the grey woven through it, and the weight of years hung under blue eyes misted by age.

"Yes?" he said.

"Matthew!" she beamed. "It *is* you!"

For a moment, he stood, frozen, mouth agape. Until frustration overtook him. "Look, lady," he snapped. "I have no idea who you are. My name is *Grant* not Matthew. I have no idea how you got my number. Or my address. Please don't call here again!" He went to slam the door, but a speedily placed foot caught it.

"You may not know me," she replied as she forced her way inside. "But I know you. Or at least, I did."

Grant backed away. "What are you doing? Get out of my house!"

"Please calm down. Please. It pains me to see you like this, big brother."

It's often said that everything can change at any moment, suddenly and forever. For Grant, all it took was those words, while staring into those misty blue eyes. Then he was Matthew once more. Barriers built up in his mind came crumbling down — the best memory alterations money could buy undone in a moment. "Emily?" he gasped.

Fabricated memories swirled with real ones, a maelstrom of past selves coalescing. He stumbled away, retreating into the comforting bubble of his study in the hope that would provide some relief.

But his sister followed him. Unrelenting. "Well if I wasn't certain before, I would be now," she remarked, gesturing to the typewriter. "For years I had to put up with you bloviating about how 'the old ways are the best'. And here you are, still click-clacking away like the dinosaur you are."

The storm of recollection was calming now, allowing things to float to the surface — memories long buried beneath a sea of falsehoods. He cringed in sympathy with his past self at their most embarrassing moments. He winced at the sharp stab of grief from the faces of those he'd lost. He felt the mind-numbing boredom of what had barely passed for a life seeping the energy from his limbs.

"Why did you come here?" Matthew stammered out. "I told you. I told you all I was moving on. Becoming someone new."

Emily glanced down. "I'm sorry. I just... You're the only family I have left now."

"You mean..."

She nodded. "Mum and Dad passed a fair while back now. My wife, Julie, was more recent."

"I'm sorry," Matthew muttered. "But I can't come back. I can't be that person again."

"I know," she said with a smile. "I just wanted to see you again before I underwent the procedure myself. Will you... Will you come with me?"

With a sigh, he nodded. "I suppose I have to go myself now anyway, if I want to get back to the *new* me. Wait here while I get ready."

Matthew hurried off to grab his bag and coat. When he returned, he and his sister walked out the door hand in hand, ready to leave behind their past selves and become the people they wanted to be. Though he knew from experience, there would still be that nagging feeling that something was wrong.

Human innovation is a remarkable thing, he mused. At the click of a button, you can erase any and all memories — versions of yourself. But it will always lack closure. No way has yet been invented to say goodbye to them.
