Excellent set-up for an urban legend. I love the classics, and "group of teenagers goes to explore spooky place" just works so well for the urban legend constraint. 

You introduce the legend well:

> Pretty much everyone growing up in this area had heard of Starvation Heights, where Linda Hazzard ran her sanitarium designed to cure people of all manner of illnesses through “fasting”.

with the casual narrative voice almost making it feel like we're one of the friends being told this by the narrator.

A small thing that threw me at the very beginning was the tenses:

> We pile into Amanda’s beat up old SUV, my friends chatting excitedly. It was nearly midnight. This became our ritual, every Friday the 13th we would go explore one of the local places rumored to be haunted.

I get the slipping into past tense to describe how this was always what they did, but I think that "It was nearly midnight" should be "It's nearly midnight". I also wondered if "This had become our ritual" using the past perfect instead of the simple past might make it a little clearer to the reader that this is recapping past events rather than what's happening now? Or perhaps a line break with the change in tense? I only really mention it because it's so near the beginning that it jumps out.

The actual scene in "Starvation Heights" was very well done and creepy. You create that frantic panicked tone very well, and the use of present tense works perfectly for us not knowing how it's going to end. Thanks for writing!
