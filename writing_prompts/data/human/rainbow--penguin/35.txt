>What’s the best advice you’ve received about writing animals / creatures? 

Not exactly advice, but from reading your stories, kat, I know how big a difference research can make. All those little details just really help sell the whole story for me


>What tips would you offer to your fellow writers?

General tips (besides generic research) is watching videos and listening to audio clips so you can accurately describe behaviours. 

Beyond that, in a lot of ways I treat it like writing people (if the story is from the pov of the anthropomorphised animals). Think about motivation, conflict etc.

And just on the topic of animals I'd like to please request avoiding the cliché of killing the dog. But that is less of a tip and more a personal request XD
