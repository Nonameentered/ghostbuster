Hey Ray! I loved the concept behind this one. The whole idea of that feeling of awe you get in those beautiful paintings, but accompanied by self-conciousness. Obviously, we see it a lot today with the need to capture the beautiful moment in a selfie or whatever, but I enjoyed the slightly more humourous comparison with the more old-fashioned portrait.

You also made me go look up that painting, which I enjoyed. And I like how you describe it here in this poem too.

In terms of feedback, I struggled a little with the rhythm of this. I couldn't quite pick up on where the stresses should be and couldn't quite get into the swing of things when reading it. I notice most of your lines have 10 syllables (but not all) but for me its the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables that is perhaps missing a little, particularly with the little pauses the commas create in the middle of some lines. But that really might just be me and the way I'm reading it, so take that with a whole heap of salt.

Overall I enjoyed the image you painted (and the painting you made me go look up). Thanks for writing!
