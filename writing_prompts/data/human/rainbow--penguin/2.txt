#A Lovers' Quarrel

The brave knight burst through the door, backlit by the sunlight streaming in after him. His eyes darted around the dark, dank interior, taking in the cobwebs clinging to the corners, the black cat prowling around his feet, and the cauldron bubbling over the fire. Then, his gaze fell on the woman, glaring at him from the armchair.

Rowena sighed as she heard the tell-tale signs of orchestral music swelling in the background. 

Sure enough, he stepped forward, chest puffed out and sword drawn as he opened his mouth. "What have you done to us evil witch, that words come out as songs so rich, in tone and timbre and in truth, revealing secrets quite uncouth?" 

His words were punctuated by clumsy kicks and twirls. No one should ever have to see someone in a full suit of armour attempt a broadway dance routine, and yet she had been subjected to it over and over.

Resigning herself to the inevitable, she pushed herself out of the comfort of her chair, countering with a shuffle-ball-change. "Don't you think, my good sir, or perhaps did it not occur, that if I were the one who cast the curse, I would not also be singing in verse?" 

She splayed her fingers at either side to unleash the power of Jazz hands — the only way she seemed able to make her magic work these days. "Simple arcane jobler as I am, all I do that's worth a damn, is sell nice sospital cures and charms, not cast curses which cause harm."

The tempo of the music increased with her movements, a sharp rap of a drum accompanying her kicks and flicks as she stalked towards the swaying knight. "But if you want an evil witch, I'll be all too happy to make the switch."

With a final flourish, Rowena pointed her palms towards him, stamping down in time with the final beat of the song. A flash of brilliant white light burst forth, startling the knight into pirouetting out the door.

As he ran, a final line of melody drifted to her on the breeze, the refrain of their duet. "But if not you, who could it be?"

"Someone proving a point to me," Rowena muttered to herself as she attempted to return to her seat. But though the last notes of the previous song were fading, a new beat was striking up.

She turned her eyes to the ceiling and sang out, "I know you're there my dearest one, don't you think you've had your fun?"

The black cat — the only creature she'd been able to rely on not to burst into song since she'd been sent into this infernal musical fairytale world — pranced into the room in time to the beat. Then in a swirl of fur and smoke, it transformed into a beautiful woman with pale skin and raven hair.

As Rowena met the gaze of those sharp green eyes, silence fell...

Until Jinx flashed her a dazzling grin, eyebrow quirking up in time to a jaunty vamped piano chord. "But how could I bring myself to end a spell, that has entertained us both so well, especially when you still refuse, to finally change your musical views." Throwing her head back, she extended her arms out.

Unable to resist, Rowena took her hands. "I only said that I'd prefer, not to have to always defer, to your taste in films and shows, given what you always propose." Their feet darted between each other's in a blur of movement. "Then just 'cause musicals aren't my thing, you trap me here and make me sing? Honestly, I don't know how, I agreed to this in our wedding vows."

As they twirled around each other, the dark, dank cottage disintegrated around them, fading back to their apartment with its red velvet furnishings and crystal balls, the scent of incense hanging in the air. 

Matching her step for step, Jinx replied, "I can't see how this is worse, than your food-related curse. When your bromography made me scoff, that really set you off. But after weeks of prandicles, my viewpoint became less radical. And now I no longer debate, the value you see in small plates."

As Jinx spun out and back in, Rowena caught her, holding her tight to whisper in her ear, "I suppose we are a strange pair, aren't we dear? But I finally see the point in musicals, now you are here."

Twisting around, Jinx returned the embrace. "I wish I could spend eternity with you. I wish that even in death we were unstoppable."

Rowena stared down into those sharp green eyes and lost herself in the magic for a moment more. "I don't expect to live forever, but I do intend to hang on as long as possible."
