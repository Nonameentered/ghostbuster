#Flight to Freedom

Dry leaves littered the forest floor, crinkling underfoot with each step. Anya drew her coat around her as she trudged towards the abandoned church in an attempt to stave off the cold. But not even her hot, black coffee could chase the chill from her bones. The air had a bite to it, breath misting in front of her. And the knowledge of what she was walking into didn't help. 

The church loomed in front of her — once pristine stone walls covered in lichen and ivy. Its spires reached to the heavens but crumbled before they got there. Stained glass windows that might have been glorious and beautiful long ago stood were dull and tarnished, the colours barely visible beneath the grime. Others were worse still — empty frames with hundreds of rainbow shards littering the ground. 

But one... One window of them all shone out as an example of pure beauty. It was the most wonderful thing Anya had ever seen. Each fragment of glass the perfect shape and shade to construct the image — a young woman reaching out to the forest and the forest reaching back. She stood entwined with the trees, all manner of creatures surrounding her. And when the light hit it, it threw a diaphanous aura of every hue into the air around it.

Anya had never particularly appreciated art, but even she felt her chest swell at the sight of it.

Shaking herself from the strange reverie, she continued towards the doors. The police cordon was already well established, and she ducked underneath with a nod to one of the officers on guard. 

Shards of glass crunched underfoot, leaves skittering across the stone floor in the breeze from the open door and window frames.

Inside, her partner, Eli was waiting for her. She handed him one of the cups of coffee and asked, "So what do we have?"

"A missing woman — Mary. She called the police from here to say that someone was following her. A man. He'd been pressuring her to come work for him for a while, apparently, and she thought he'd become obsessed and was coming for her. That was all the information we got. Then there was a scream, and the call cut out."

Anya nodded along. "And when you got here?"

"Mary was gone. But we found her phone — broken of course. Maybe signs of a struggle but," he gestured around to the general mess, "it's difficult to tell."

"Anything else?"

"Yeah, but it's a little...weird." Eli beckoned one of the uniformed offices over, taking an evidence bag off him. Inside was an iridescent feather. The way it caught the light, it looked like it almost glowed. "It was right next to the phone," Eli explained. "Might be nothing but..."

"But we've gotta follow every lead," Anya finished with a smile. She took the evidence bag off of him, examining the strange feather more closely. Something stirred in the back of her mind, but she couldn't quite put her finger on it. Glancing back up at her partner, she asked, "I don't suppose there are any witnesses."

"Of course not," Eli replied with a chuckle. "That would be too easy. But Mary's friend did come here looking for her. And found us instead."

"Have you questioned them yet?"

"Nah. I was waiting for you."

Eli led her over to a young woman. She was wearing a floaty, ethereal blue dress — far too lightweight for the current weather — and her long brown hair cascaded over her shoulders in messy waves with flowers woven into it. *An artist*, Anya surmised, with only a hint of disdain.

"Hello," she said as they approached. "I'm Detective Anya Petrov and this is my partner, Detective Eli Jacobson. Is it okay if we ask you a few questions?"

The young woman nodded.

Anya glanced at Eli, who took out his pad to take notes while she led the interview. "First off, what's your name?"

"Alex," she replied quietly.

"And how did you know your friend would be here, Alex?"

"She came here every night to work on that." The young woman pointed to the single pristine stained glass window. "This whole place was like a blank canvas to her. Somewhere to practice her craft. I helped occasionally. I'm an artist too, you know."

*Knew it,* Anya thought, before continuing with her questions. "I see. And did Mary ever mention anyone bothering her? Perhaps someone she was scared of."

Alex nodded. "There was a guy. I think his name might have been Kasey... But she said he wouldn't leave her alone. He insisted she had to work for him and no one else. Said her art was so beautiful he had to have it. But Mary's a free spirit, you know?"

"Did she ever report this man to the police?"

"I don't think so. Not that she mentioned to me, anyway."

Anya was about to wrap up when she glanced down at the evidence bag she held in her hand. The feather inside was *definitely* glowing now. And not just a trick of the light reflecting the sun's rays. She held it up to get a closer look. As the bag moved closer to Alex it shone brighter still.

That same something from before stirred in the back of her mind. A little clearer now. A story her babushka used to tell her. In fact, this whole case was reminiscent of it. 

*There had been a young artist whose work caught the eye of a powerful wizard. But when she refused his requests he transformed her into a beautiful bird whose feathers glowed with magic. Then, he transformed himself into a great black falcon to scoop her up and carry her away, leaving behind only a scattering of feathers which glowed brightly for those that appreciated true beauty.*

But that was just a story, wasn't it?

Still, as she'd said to her partner only moments ago, they had to follow every lead.

"Thank you for your time, Alex," Anya said with a nod. Then, she turned to Eli. "I've got a hunch I'm going to follow up on. But I wouldn't want to waste your time with it. It's a bit of a long shot. See you back at the station?"

"Sure," he replied.

But she was already hurrying away.

Clasping the evidence bag in her hand, Anya stared down at the strange feather, watching for any change in brightness. She turned in a slow circle, before setting off in the direction the light indicated.

It was a frustrating process, with many false starts ending up in art classes or galleries, but eventually, she found herself at a disused warehouse at the edge of the city. Surely this had to be the place.

The sun had sunk below the horizon long ago, and she found herself relying on the feather to light her way. And it provided more than enough to see by, getting every brighter still. 

She wound her way through rusted machinery until she saw it — a bird covered in the same, storage feathers, locked in a large cage.

After a quick glance around, listening carefully for any sign she wasn't alone, she hurried forward. 

A heavy-duty padlock sealed the door shut, but she had her set of picks with her. Moments later, the door swung open with a long, loud *creeaaak*.

The bird looked at her, ruffling its beautiful glowing feathers. Then, it nodded and took off into the night. 

Anya watched it go, flying up into the heavens to glow amongst the stars.

She had no idea how to bring Mary back. But at least now, she was free.
