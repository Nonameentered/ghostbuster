Much to my surprise, I managed all of my tasks this month \o/

1) I wrote a fair few stories with mythical creatures, including a [kitsune based one](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/wu3265/comment/im00kxo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for SEUS and all the things on [this PM](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/xgjimj/pm_give_me_a_mythical_creature_a_genre_and_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

2) I wrote over 37.5k words (which I really didn't expect to do). Huge shout-out to the Word Off event on the discord for helping push me to do this.

3) Obviously I also managed the original version of this task (not made 50% harder) which was to write 25k words this month.

4) I did a [PM](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/xgjimj/pm_give_me_a_mythical_creature_a_genre_and_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) asking for different genres in addition to other contstraints.

This month I will:

1) Write a Western (eek!)

2) Share a novel idea

3) Dig through some old notes and words on that novel idea and write an outline

4) Write four serial chapters (I'm aware this will likely get a little forgotten during NaNo so want to make good progress while I can)
