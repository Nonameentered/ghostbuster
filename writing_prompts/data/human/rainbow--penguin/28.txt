#Join Me

Throughout our history, there has always been talk of the last great frontier. The hidden depths of the oceans. The vast expanse of outer space. The limitless capabilities of technology. We are obsessed with the unknowable, driven to pursue it to the farthest reaches of the universe. No matter the risk. No matter the consequence. No matter the cost. We *must* understand what we were not meant to understand. It is part of what makes us *human*.

And yet, how few people take the time to truly know themselves? That was *my* last great frontier.

I threw myself into the challenge wholeheartedly, making great strides in the field. I delved into the hidden depths of the subconscious. I swam in the vast expanse of experience. I investigated the limitless capabilities of the mind. With my tech, I could bring the hidden worlds inside myself into the light. 

I was learning so much. And yet, there was still so much more I didn't know. So how could I have known what would happen? How could I have known that such feats were a violation of the order of nature? I was simply indulging in the most human endeavours — the pursuit of knowledge. How could I have known that knowledge was forbidden?

It started small, with a strange tint entering the light around me. 

Ever the scientist, I made sure to note everything down, searching for patterns and meaning. 

I began to notice how the varying hues coincided with moods. After a triumph, the air would practically glow with gold. Frustration led to clouds of red. Confusion and uncertainty painted the world in yellow.

And when a dark mood seized me, shadows shifting in the corner of my vision as if converging on a new centre of gravity — a new centre of the universe. I had unlocked the powers of the mind and become something more than man. 

As my power grew, it seemed as if time was slipping away. At first, a few seconds lost here and there. But seconds grew to minutes which grew to days. 

That was when I started journaling. No longer confining my notes to the purely scientific, I began to record every second of every day.

I'd expected to be greeted with blank pages corresponding to the chunks of time I seemed to be missing. Instead, a sense of dread crept over me as I stared down at my own scribbled handwriting describing events I had no memory of — describing events I had no wish to remember.

I read in skin-crawling detail how my victims' screams had sounded, how the warmth of their blood had felt, how the grey of their fear faded to black and melted into the shadows swirling around me.

Somewhere inside me, the human part of my mind, whispered warnings. I should turn myself in, stop my experiments and destroy my notes. I should make sure that whatever I had unleashed on the world was caged and never allowed out again.

But as my thoughts swam, the yellow of uncertainty around me took on the glint of gold.

Whatever this thing I had unleashed was, it had come from inside of me. It was part of me, and I was part of it. Perhaps I didn't truly understand it yet. Perhaps I never would. It was unknowable. *I* was unknowable. And this was *my* last great frontier.

So I kept journaling — kept experimenting. I delved deeper, swam further, investigated more thoroughly. Thanks to my work, I soon began to catch glimpses of what I'd come to think of as *the other me*. The time I spent in that form seemed to grow and grow, the barriers between the two selves weakening with every day that passed as I pushed further and further. 

Until the barriers separating us gave way completely, leaving me whole for the first time in my entire life. Only it wasn't just *me* anymore. Hundreds of consciousnesses swirled in the shadows around me. Swirled in me.

But I needed more. I might have truly understood myself, but every mind was different. If I truly wanted to *know* the human condition, I must experience them all. They must all join me.

So join me, dear reader. Join me in the ecstasy of knowledge and discovery. The details enclosed in this journal are just a taste of what is to come. A taste of the unknowable, something you are surely driven to pursue just as I was.

No matter the risk. No matter the consequence. No matter the cost. You *must* understand what you were not meant to understand. It is part of what made you *human*.
