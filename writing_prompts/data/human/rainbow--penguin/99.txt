It stopped at the summit of the highest peak, carrying Asami and Hinata into a cave that extended further than seemed possible before lowering them to the ground.

As his vision adjusted, Hinata saw hundreds of pairs of eyes staring back at him. A chorus of *meowls* erupted. From his feet, Asami yowled back.

"Where have you brought me?" Hinata asked. "And why?"

"This place is our sanctuary," the big cat replied. "I brought you here for my kin. Just as you would not leave her, she would not leave you."

Hinata glanced down at Asami who stared back with wide green eyes. She blinked slowly.

"And now," it continued. "I must go." It turned, muscles rippling under shimmering black fur.

"Wait! You can't just—"

"I do not have time for this, human!" the cat growled.

"But what about the other animals? The people? What will that swarm do to them?"

The cat wrinkled its nose in haughty disdain. "They will be fine. Only those in tune with the spirit world will face the wrath of the swarm. The rest of the world will remain oblivious." Its gaze snapped to him and its pupils narrowed. "How do you know of the swarm?"

Staring into a jaw of mountain-like teeth, Hinata shivered. "I-I saw it."

"You have spirit magic?" 

Hinata nodded. "I am at one with the earth."

"No wonder Asami likes you." The cat's mouth quirked up into something approximating a smile before it grew serious once more. "Now, I really must go. Someone must fight back the swarm."

"I could—"

"No, human. I will feel better knowing you are here to protect them." Before he could protest, the big cat sprinted away.

Hinata turned back to the many eyes staring at him from the dark — his new charges.
