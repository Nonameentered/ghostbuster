I really struggle with this so don't really have any advice or tips (though looking forward to everyone else's).

What I end up doing a lot of the time is like with any other character figuring out motivations and interests. As much as possible I draw on experience of kids I know (it very much helps doing outreach in schools). 

A lot of the time I've learnt that I have to go back and adjust language later. If I try and do it as I write it interrupts my flow too much and I end up overthinking everything XD
