Harold's face blazed with pride as Shannon untied the bow, stealing laughing glances at Harold as she lifted the lid off the box.

Inside sat a nicely polished solid steel egg, just the size of a normal egg.

Shannon's face had a funny look on it. She looked to the ground for a moment, before letting out a small sigh and forcing a grin towards her idiot.

"A.. metal egg..?" Shannon tried to keep her tone light.

"Yeah!" Harold spoke with the innocence of a spoiled puppy. "I made it for you with the boys, over at that brewhouse smeltery. Look, I carved our initials into it. It's supposed to symbolize our fertility, or the strength of our future children, or the strength of our family bloodline; I'll show you the chart explaining the meaning later, it's upstairs somewhere."

Shannon bit her lips as she held back tears, her mind still lingering on the necklace she had explicitly asked Harold for a month ago, then two weeks ago, and then again a few days ago.

Anger broiled in her torso as her heart rate rose. The voice in her mind grew higher pitch and faster, urging her to storm out of the house, to freak out, to smash something, to throw this goddamn egg into the trash.

Yet, the time for that was years ago. Shannon again forced a pathetic little smile, which Harold lapped up like a kitten laps up its mothers milk.

Shannon finished praising Harold for his shitty gift before putting down their two little ones while Harold played League of Legends.
