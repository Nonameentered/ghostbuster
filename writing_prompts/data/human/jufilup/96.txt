My initia was that if the entire society was rain (running water) powered, then weeks to months after there would be low access to most needed resources.

I’ve also been binging am I the asshole, so I’ve been reading lots of stories of insecure men.

So I imagined a super insecure man in a breadline that was necessary because it stopped raining and they’re in a vaguely apocalyptic society and he’s just pissed that he can’t provide and how this will make him look to others etc.

Idk I didn’t wanna spell that out but I do get that it’s kinda a leap to take lol
