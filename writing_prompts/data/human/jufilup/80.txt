“And of course we have a lovely patch of cobwebs in the corner of this basement. Yes, look at them, they are lovely! And then over here we have a dusty old wooden desk with a bunch of knickknacks and jars of various items submerged in fluids. Of course, that is not all!” I ran through my spiel, a script I had memorized nearly word for word.

The curtains fluttered, and I knew I had him on the hook.

“And of course, if we move even deeper into this cobwebby, dark, dingy, basement we can see a beautiful section coated in black mold. Now, when we set up the actual haunted house, we will just wall up this section, leaving many many small holes for airflow. Thus, your customers will have a subtly shorter lifespan.” I said proudly, looking at my months of handiwork. I of course spoke through a certified gas mask.

The curtains fluttered even harder, cabinets opened and closed, lights turned on and off.

I held out the contract for the dinky little house, placing it on a dusty table.

A rapid flutter of furniture, and a messy signature was scrawled on the note. 

“Thank you so much, I hope you enjoy the space!”

Another good day of work.
