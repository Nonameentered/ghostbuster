I thought a little prayer to God for being transferred back to section A174. One of the souls around me were also blessed with the opportunity to be transferred to A174.

"Oh, thank God." He whispered.

An arch of red lightning instantly incinerated the wretch, reducing his translucent body to dust. He uttered an extremely brief scream as it occurred. Then his translucent body was resummoned, and this time Jack the Ripper visciously mutilated him until he died. Then his body was resummoned.

Rookie mistake, I thought as I walked towards A174, avoiding the eyes of my previous demon captor.

The demon who controlled A174 was well famed among us lost souls. He or she was supposed to be a therapist or sociologist or something in the past life, and showed great work ethic to so quickly be promoted to a demon watching over an entire section.

I walked into what appeared to be a sharing session. Stale doughnuts, cookies, coffee, lemonade, tea, and water lined a table. I filled a plastic cup with coffee, a paper plate with one chocolate sprinkle doughnut and a sugar cookie, and went to take a seat in the second to last row.

A fellow spirit was sharing a story from his past, seemingly an event that ruined his marriage. He had cheated, realized his wife would leave him, and take the children, and murder suicided them all.

He had asked God for forgiveness for the murder, and would have certainly made it into heaven, but suicide? Big no-no. His name was Herald, he missed his family.

"Okay, Herald, we're going to have to stop there for our session this week, but it sounds like you've made some real progress since joining me here. I'm looking forward to our session next week." The speaker took the stage, a tall, blonde, thin woman wearing a light blue power suit. 

"Unfortunately, not all of you will be as lucky as Herald and remain in my care. You all know the drill, rotations are here, and I am truly sorry to you souls that I lose. It has been my honor to care for you, and I hope to see you again someday. The list of the souls in my section should have been posted on the board by now. See me if you need some final comfort."

An extremely long comfort line formed, and the demon gave a motherly speech to each soul, hugging several, cradling a few like babies in her arms, even breastfeeding one particular ghost, who gooed and gahed as it fed.

And I went to look at the board, and saw only one name: my own.

Oh finally, I thought, I can tackle this chronic depression.
