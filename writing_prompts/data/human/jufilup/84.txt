Jason and Fred shuffled through the garbage strewn around the building, hoping for little treasures as always. Last time they’d found a 
little jar of weed, so dry it barely needed a spark; this time, Fred hoped for some loose cash or some tech to pawn.

Jason felt a jolt of surprise upon looking through a doorway to a pristine room, beautifully ordained with Victorian era furniture and decoration. A large sofa and coffee table dominated the room, followed by side tables, an old radio and record player, and a myriad of knick knacks.

“Whoa.” Fred said.

“Yeah, what the fuck, man?” Jason said, before attempting to make the plunge into this new treasure trove.

“Ouch!” Jason yelped, bashing head first into the beautiful room. Feeling silly, Jason thought it must be one of those hologram paintings that shimmers as you change perspective.

But Jason and Fred knew that could not be. Fred felt panic grip him. He needed to fucking run.

“Hey man, I’m gonna dip.” Fred spoke slowly, not wanting to get razzed later.

“Alright, man I’ll be behind you.” And Fred was off.

And then Jason saw Her.

As if she had always been, she stared into Jason as she lounged on the large couch, a glass of wine in one fist and a book in the other.

Jason’s throat closed up as he tried to utter a scream, unable to break eye contact. The woman looked more corpse than warm, beating flesh.

Her skin carried a dark blue, gray tinge that you’d expect from a beached whale. Her blonde, unkempt 80’s style hair fell on her shoulders, and Jason could tell she had once been beautiful. She wore a mini romper and while Jason would usually be aroused, he struggled not to stare at her varicose veins, drawing careful purple lines across her body like ants at a picnic.

After a while, she looked away, and Jason felt permission to do the same. In an almost bored fashion, she returned to her reading, and took a very long draw of her wine glass. She emptied the glass, and snapped her fingers expectantly, not even looking at Jason.

Tiny fists bunched Jason’s clothing into their hands before steadily pulling him towards her. The hands rapidly stitched a new outfit, a beautiful black and white suit with an apron. Jason’s lips were brushed by a thousand kisses.

He refilled the wine glass with a polite nod to Madame Chambril before returning to the servant’s quarters.
