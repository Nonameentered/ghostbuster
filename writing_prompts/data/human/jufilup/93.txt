The candlelight danced on the wall as Sebastian read. His battery powered clock ticked on and on, Sebastian nearly counted the seconds. Six more hours before mom and dad would be home, maybe they'd be able to see him today.

Footfalls sounded above Sebastian, an unsteady pitter patter of children playing, running from room to room, playing tag or chase or cops and robbers.

Nearing lunch time, Sebastian walked the three steps to his pantry, and took in his stock.

A few dozen cans of various veggies, mainly beans, several gallons of water and even a few precious cans of soda, many bags of chips, a few loaves of bread, several huge jars of peanut butter, and various cooking spices for when his parents finally gift him a battery powered water boiler.

Sebastian had been promised it last birthday, but understandably, when mom and dad's boss came for the monthly checkup, he was left to celebrate alone. He sang himself a beautiful happy birthday, tears silently streaming down his face.

For a single sick moment the thought to hurl open the door and scream at the guests crossed his mind. It was his birthday after all, how dare they upstage him? His dinner spewed into his toilet bucket, as his mind imagined what would happen if he did that, what they may do to him.

He never knew what happened to the hidden that were caught, but his mom and dad's fear was enough to strike fire into his belly, to curdle the milk in his stomach, to cause him to double over, and clench his fists to his temples, praying away the headache. All due to rules in the country, apparently. Two kids max, and those two kids were already running around, still playing cops and robbers.

And yet how could he sit there, reading The Lord of the Fucking Flies for the thousandth time, sympathizing with Piggy for the hundredth time; he used to strike him as whiny, but found himself in Piggy more every day.

Suddenly Sebastian jolted to his feet, a new fire in his gut. Yanking his door open, Sebastian burst onto the scene, which appeared to be a tea time or a birthday party or maybe a brunch.

The other parents looked astonished and disgusted, before turning their eyes to Sebastian's mom and dad.

Vehicles with blinking blue and red lights came, Sebastian's eyes took hours to adjust to this new blinding light in the above world. His parents were escorted to a sedan, and Sebastian was escorted to an SUV, where a few adults were waiting for him.

"Hey, Sebastian, honey. You're okay. We are here now." The social worker said, offering her hand to help Sebastian into the vehicle.

Sebastian looked at his parents, mom stared at the cop car's floor, dad stared hateful daggers.

Sebastian held his gaze, and after a few minutes the driver eased onto the gas.
