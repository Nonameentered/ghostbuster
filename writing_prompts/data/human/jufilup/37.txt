First, Kaitlyn noticed her heart rate rising, as if her body needed to rapidly transition from enjoying her morning's coffee to literally physically fighting off a bear attack.

She spoke to her mother, Helen, briefly on the phone. Helen's words fumbled over each other, each hoping to be able to grab the rugby ball of thought, to understand why her daughter left her, *abandoned* her. Or why she was kidnapped, or even how she died. 

How the mind of a parent can wander.

It must have been Helen; she knew the safe word, the one trigger word their family would use if they were ever in an emergency. Helen whispered RIP Saint Anthony (a small Catholic inside joke), and Kaitlyn couldn't have been more certain she was living with imposters.

Yet only moments after a sharp knock sounded on my bedroom door.

"Kaitlyn, honey, dinner time." Helen's footsteps plodded to the kitchen, the pit pats growing softer as Kaitlyn tried to manage her heart rate.

The dinner table was adorned with four plates, four cups of Coca Cola Zero, four forks and knives, and four helpings of steak and mashed potatoes, with a side of roast veggies.

After a brief prayer silence arose as it oft did. Rather, as it always must.

Frank sat at the head table, methodically picking his steak apart with knife and fork in a delicate, forceful manner. The knife would daintily saw through the red, juicy steak as the Colorado river took its blessed time cutting that nice old canyon.

A light cough from Helen deigned a glance from Frank. She uttered a rapid excuse me via her posture, turning her eyes and hands to her lap, like a school child scolded.

Kaitlyn was grateful for the silence, for her father's abuses; she merely must eat a little steak, then the man would surely be at the television, idly groping Helen while he watched the game and talked on the phone with the boys.

Frank finished his artful sectioning of the steak, and turned to the mashed potatoes as the bolus moved from his gullet to his stomach, ready to be dissolved by the stomach acids feeding from his pancreas and gallbladder, as well as the acid produced by chief cells in the stomach itself.

Frank also ate the mash methodically, though this time cutting it into two halves before slamming them one at a time into his face.

His veggies ignored, Frank drained his Coke Zero, before regarding the table setting across from him, empty of human life.

"Where is Leo?" Frank asked. "Why hasn't he been found. Why haven't *you* found him?"

Helen shuddered under Frank's piercing gaze, he quickly backhanded her.

"It has been three days, woman! You know I work hard every day, sometimes twelve hour days, mind you! Find him, Helen. Find him by Friday. That's three days from now, you dumb cow. You can remember that, right?" Frank finished his little speech, threw his still dirty dish in the sink, and retired to watch football on the tube in the living room.

Kaitlyn returned to her room, simply happy not to have received Frank's ire.

She first noticed her phone buzzing, constantly buzzing.

Helen sounded frantic on the other side.

"Kaitlyn, hey honey. It's mommy again. Please come home Kaitlyn. We love you and want you here." Her voice lowered. "Please honey, I know it's hard. Please help me."

Kaitlyn heard a loud crash from the other end as Frank screamed. The phone line cut out.
