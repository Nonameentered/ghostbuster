"Please." Sarah cried. "I'm sorry." She had long learned that her words made no matter, most likely no one could even hear her, yet she spoke for herself, one of her few comforts.

"Why did I do this?" The stream of guilt flew steady. "What is wrong with me? I knew. For years I knew something, well not this, but something bad would happen. I knew I was setting myself up."

Taking accountability to herself in the dank gray of the basement staved off the ill feelings as long as she stoked her courage.

She recounted how she had tried millions of times, how she had promised herself to work harder, to grind so that she would not have to thieve. Instead, she labored a few hours a week.

The pit in her stomach deepened. She felt she deserved this. Well, not this, but something horrid. Something that would help her *change*, to help her dig out of the deep hole she found herself in.

Unsurprisingly, she did not change, wallowing away in the hole.

The dark man was surprisingly generous, graciously allowing Sarah to maintain her physical health. Semi-regular meals were provided, their size making up for their inconsistency. Sarah suspected the man did not live there.

Slowly she came to love him, or maybe to appreciate him deeply at least, with the potential for more. She imagined the face behind his dark brown eyes, the only feature she could make out through the eye slit as he presented meals.

He was so good to her, so handsome, well-mannered, orderly, the talk of the town, not to mention a homeowner, with a rather large basement (imagine the size of the upstairs!). Sarah reflected fondly as she ate the Chic-Fil-A sandwich that her dark lover provided.

The room had a splendid dingy gray feeling. The door was ornamented by an interesting five-pronged pattern, sliding its way gracefully across the concrete, tinged with a rosy red. Sarah admired the room as she ate her sandwich.

Sarah longed for more, to hold the man, to sing to him, to open his heart, and perhaps join him above, to care for his children, or bare him some if he had none. The thought of another woman left chills in her throat and brought genuine anger to her heart.

That stupid bitch! She thought of the phantom, the weird ghost that longed to steal her future husband.

She silently began a hunger strike, stuffing the food into her trashcan, sure her lover would notice, would take her into his arms, kiss her face frantically then listen for her heartbeat. Would take her to McDonald's and then to a movie. Would make love in the evening and the morning.

He, of course, did not notice.

The strike lasted for four days before the event finally arrived and Sarah was slaughtered and prepared to be served to the man and his companions.
