Jason pulled his hand from the bag, popcorn clutched in his fist, before passing it around the room. Seventeen people lounged in a cuddle puddle in Jason’s living room, and Jason had never felt happier.

Jason’s homestead fell right in the center of the path of the eclipse, and he had been charging exorbitant rates for the privilege to see the beautiful bright darkness.

Peaking outside, ready to break up trouble, Jason looked into a sea of tents, beanbags, trailers, pick up trucks, fishing gear for the nearby pond, and eager faces wearing cardboard glasses.

Jason hoped they got the day wrong, he’d make at least another hundred grand if they stayed another night.

Yet, at a quarter to 9pm, Jason knew they got it right. A moment of silence followed by the roar of a million men. Jason fought against the mob, trying to get back into his home and on the roof for a proper look at the spectacle.

A leg between Jason’s legs, and suddenly only the ground. Jason spit out dirt, rapidly becoming a mixture of mud and saliva as he felt footfalls on his back, arms, legs.

“Get that sumbitch! We can take his house!”

The footfalls escalated, almost more like kicks, cracking ribs and bruising Jason’s white flesh.

Jason watched a steel toed boot come crashing into his nose. His head snapped back hard, and sat at a harsh angle. His eyes were wide open, staring at the beautiful darkness.
