Luther hesitated before responding. "Yes, sonny. I saw many copies of it. I took down all of them that I saw, of course. But, there were so many. And sometimes, I'd be with a neighbor or a friend, or just in the city where there are people, though seldom. I couldn't take down the posters without suspicion."

"Can I see it?" Michael asked.

"Well," Luther cleared his throat nervously. He had been dreading this moment. All the same, he retrieved one of the hundreds of crumpled-up posters. "look, I know this looks bad, really bad. But you know how these go, it'll all blow over. Just lay low for a few months, maybe a year. I'll get food, I'll take care of us, sonny. You just stay inside. A handful of other young men around your age and with about your looks will be taken in, killed, and the captors rewarded. The posters will get taken down or covered over. We will be able to continue life again!"

Michael heard nearly none of this monologue, instead taking in the wanted poster.

It began with his name, sex, race, and biographical and physical data, followed by a large unblinking image of Michael's face, in color print, even capturing the bright blue of his eyes, the pink flush that often found its way into his cheeks. Finally, at the bottom, contained the reward. The pit in Michael's stomach grew as he read.

Thirty pounds of beef, of which, twenty pounds would be cuts chosen by the captor (the other ten pounds would surely be stew meat), several boxes of nuts, dried fruits, spices, and refrigerated goods in scarce supply, including *ice cream.* At this point, Michael was already seriously considering taking the easy route out, as he always had a Glock in its holster. The next sentence took him even closer to the brink. A diesel generator with two full thousand-gallon tanks of fuel.

Michael suddenly side-eyed Luther, who was preparing their lunch of baked beans. Fear built in Michael's chest, his heart rate escalating. Was Luther waiting for him to sleep before incapacitating him? Would he poison his food? Was he pretending?

The paranoia ate at Michael. He went hungry that night.

The next day when Luther went to the market for groceries, Michael left his room for the first time, helping himself to several cans of beans, only trusting the unopened cans. Luther had left him some lemonade (more water than lemonade truly), yet Michael could not trust it.

The days and weeks moved slowly, the posters still piled high in the streets.

Frustrations mounted slowly, as Michael grew infuriated at this injustice that has been set upon him, this undeserved malady he has been forced to swallow. Not only suffer with it but pretend to be happy, to smile and act cheery and complacent with his warden, who wants constant affection, and praise for doing the bare minimum of purchasing beans. Why would a provider be praised for feeding their dependent?

To have more and more demanded, to be guilted, and hounded, and reminded, always reminded of the *favor* that has been done, or how *lucky* you should feel, and how, truly, you are being silly to *not* realize how lucky you are.

To be reminded, with a little knowing smirk, of the other boys who had been hung, for having the name Michael, or looking blonde and blue-eyed enough. Stating the fact of the dead men, and then pausing, waiting for Michael to respond to the atrocity, and to express how lucky and grateful he was to have this little shed, this little closet in which he can exist.

"Since it's gotten cold, I'm gonna sneak into the city today, really bundled up in a scarf, hat, and coat. I'm going to see if the posters have lessened at all, or if they're still piled to the third story of most buildings." Michael said to Luther as he made the morning beans.

"What? No, no sonny! You can't do that! You've got to be careful, they hung that poor little Hispanic boy just two days ago, all because his name was Miguel. I saw it, I was there! He had jet black hair and dark brown eyes, answered to Miguel but otherwise had no English. The kid was just confused, repeating, again and again, no habla ingles."

Michael listened as the argument continued, he was not swayed and did not attempt to debate his position.

Luther refused to come with him, oddly. He said he'd have beans ready for him when he returned, turning his nose aloof, seemingly upset or nervous. 

Probably still disapproving of the adventure, Michael thought.

The journey passed uneventfully, passing not a soul other than a few squirrels and birds.

The bustle of the city on a Saturday could be heard a few blocks from the square, Michael's anxiety bubbled as he tightened his scarf, leaving only his bright blue eyes visible to the public.

Yet, the square contained no bounty hunter imagery, no posters, no leaflets, no men in dark uniforms with large guns, nothing. Michael felt fairly sure he was in the town center, yet asked a shopkeeper just to confirm his belief. This was the spot Luther had claimed to be tearing down posters for years, even just yesterday bringing home a pile of thirty or forty papers, with awards greater than ever before.

Michael sprinted home, ditching his scarf midway as it seemed to stifle his breath.

The house was empty. Luther's closet had been cleared. His prized knickknacks and keepsakes had been removed. One of their cars was missing.
