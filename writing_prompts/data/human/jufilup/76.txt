Tom carefully sprayed a smiley face of cheese onto each ritz cracker before passing them to Becka. Becka carried the tray of cheesy crackers, sliced ham, and grapes over to the leather reclining couch. Becka and Tom settled in; Tom turned the old television on the wall, putting in a VCR tape of The Land Before Time, one of Becka's favorites.

As Little Foot dealt with the Big Waters, Becka dozed off leaning against Tom. Tom eyed the tray of ritz crackers, the smiley faces reflected at him. Tom set them down, playing with Becka's hair with his other hand.

Little Foot did eventually conquer the Big Waters; he was saved at the last moment, by a motherly water swimming dinosaur. He and his friends made it home to their families before nightfall, ready to rest before their next adventure. Tom rooted most for Peetree, though Sarah was a close second contender. 

Abruptly the door splayed inward. A single bullet entered Tom's left temple, exiting the middle back of his skull. A little of his brains gooped onto the floor, splashing with a little thuck. Most of the blood was behind him, on the wooden floors, the old leather sofa, the tree trunk side tables. Just a little mist sprayed Becka, as she somehow maintained her rest.

A large man clad in a business suit entered the cabin, heaved Tom up in a fireman's carry, and left the scene.
