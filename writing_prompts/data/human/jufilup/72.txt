Timmy knelt, peering up to The Great Book before taking his seat in the pew, squeezed between his mom and dad.

"Greetings, brothers and sisters, and welcome to the temple." Father Marky spoke to the congregation. He stood before a podium, adorned in classical catholic priest garb. "We gather together today to celebrate Our Savior, and to explore the sacred text he saved. As we all know the story, He found the ancient tome, gifted by God himself, and gifted it to us."

Timmy eyes drooped. He wanted to play his Nintendo. Timmy's dad had made him leave it in the car. 

Timmy played sticks with himself. Both hands started with one. He hit his right with his left, and his right hand now had two. He hit his left hand with his right, and his left now had three. He delivered a killing blow to his right with his left. The right hand gained five, and died. Timmy looked at his hands, and then at the church.

An enormous stained glass window of The Book filled the wall behind Father Marky. The page it opened to showed a particularly nasty ghoul. The page had stats, such as health, speed, stealth, danger level, and descriptions of the various items and abilities the monsters might have. 

Timmy still avoided looking at the ghoul, its grey and cracking skin clung to its thin, skeletal frame. It's eyes seemed fully dilated, deep black pits. Crispy, dry, scraggly hair cascaded down its shoulders. It stood favoring its left leg, with its left shoulder jutted upward, as if it had been stomping when the picture took place.

Timmy's daddy pinched his shoulder. Timmy looked to see a stern gaze, and a disapproving mean head shake. Pay attention, it said, or else when we get home...

"...And so we will be holding special training camps, just a month long so that the little tykes can learn more about The Great Book, and get used to the weapons we must all learn to use: the bow, the spear, and the sword. These weapons are critical to our daily survival, and the younguns should learn sooner than later. If you're uncomfortable, we would love some parental chaperones to attend the camp too."

Timmy's mommy and daddy did not opt to chaperone. Timmy's daddy wanted to work during the day and go in his office at night, putting on some headphones and playing a game. He once let Timmy join him, they played a little racing game. Timmy had fun.

\---

The bus was short, only able to hold about twelve kids. The land was not fertile though; only six seats were occupied, and one of them by the bus driver, Gerald's daddy.

The first week consisted mainly of festivities. Timmy enjoyed a fun little puppet show where a bunch of strong humans defeated mean evil monsters; a buff man threw a spear through the eyeball of a ghoul, and it exploded into dust particles.

The second week consisted of deeper understanding of The Great Word. Long hours of class work was spent memorizing stats, items, abilities, weaknesses, and committing them to memory for The Test.

The third week was spent studying the above information, and practicing The Three Weapons. Timmy preferred the bow; he didn't want to be close to any of the monsters.

The final week horrified Timmy. Exam Day loomed. Timmy spent his hours pouring The Great Book, hoping to at least finish the written portion of the exam.

\---

The day before The Exam, Father Marky held a meeting.

"My children, you have come far. After this exam, you will have completed the first step in many to becoming a Warrior, to being one of the brave men and women who protect us all."

Timmy sank in his seat. A Warrior. Brutality flashed through Timmy's mind, the images of Warrior victims that littered The Great Book: torn to pieces by werewolves, having your soul sucked away by a spectre, being burned alive by a dragon, being eaten by any number of wild things, having your head stomped in by an angry ghoul.

"I understand most of your parents wouldn't have told you, but know that you can and must succeed. You have all Aced the written exam, all that remains is the practical exam. The Drawing will commence tonight. Good luck." Father Marky left with a grimace.

\---

Timmy went fourth in the drawing, and thus would take his practical fourth. A sack contained five stones with simple monster images. The task was simple, neutralize the foe. You need not kill the enemy, simply neutralize.

Gerald went first, pale faced and stiff legged. He began crying when he chose a dragon.

"Don't worry, son, it's only a eight month old dragon, tamed too. He's been fed by us since he was a baby, you got lucky!" Gerald's father said, yet sweat bristled his neck all the same.

Angel went second, getting extremely fortunate with an imp. He could simply step on it.

Chester went third, drawing a werewolf. He let out a little yelp, dropping the grey stone to the floor like a hot pastry. Father Marky explained how it was somehow a weaker werewolf, but Timmy didn't get it. Chester didn't speak again.

And finally Timmy, a fifty-fifty between two unknowns.

The stone looked like Timmy's mommy.

"Ah, a mimic my child, well not to worry..." Timmy didn't understand why this one was weaker either, and tears welled in his eyes. 

He closed his mouth hard, wanting to make his parents proud.

Timmy didn't pay attention to what George drew.

\---

Gerald got lucky, only losing a hand before Father Marky blew the dragon's brains out, scattering the gore into Gerald's open wound. Gerald wailed for a little bit before passing out.

Timmy was fortunately still in the waiting room, waiting for his turn.

Angel did just step on the imp, and came out bubbling happy, high-fiving the remaining children.

Chester came back in hysterics. "I didn't wanna!" He screamed. "Why did they make me?" He balled up his fists, smashing them into his temples.

"Whoa, little Chesty, calm down." Father Marky said.

"I hate you!" Chester screamed, he hurled himself towards Father Marky, and though his little fists fell mightily, Father Marky merely felt pity.

No one enjoys stabbing a young pup, but Chester succeeded.

\---

"Hi honey, come join me." Timmy's mommy waved him over, inviting him to join the picnic.

Timmy walked towards her; he had missed his mommy so much. It was really special to him that she had decided to chaperone him after all. She had even brought his favorites: a grilled cheese sandwich, cheetoh puffs, and some Fanta orange.

Timmy had just taken a step on the picnic blanket when his mommy expanded horizontally as she folded downward. Her back and shoulders expanded to form the front of a chest, flesh and bone turning to wood and metal. The chest rapidly grew sharp teeth, opening into a skeevy smirk.

Timmy's head was missing before he could scream.
