The train car passed farmer George's land, followed by the church, several businesses, the town's elementary school, before stopping at the station. Ticket inspecting officers policed the doors, nodding at Caleb as he exited the train, his soft footfalls leaving prints in the soft, slightly wet dirt.

Several Watchers traveled with him, some sprouting feet and legs to walk, some converting to spheres and rolling, some sliding on their bellies, much like penguins, some of the older, fancier ones even sprouting cars, skateboards, bicycles, and rolling along on them. Their blue, silvery, and white translucent bodies shimmered in the light.

One of the younger ones smiled at Caleb, reaching out a blob of its silvery blue flesh and offering a fist bump, which Caleb accepted.

Christina's mom looked into her eyes, pulling her hand away from the fist bump. "Sounds good, honey. Okay. I'm gonna grab my bag and use the bathroom. Car in 5 minutes?" Her mom smiled before rushing off, and Christina put on her prom dress.

The night flew by, especially after accepting the fireball-sprite combo Jessica offered when they met in the limo. Terrible mix, tasted awful, then not so bad.

Christina didn't even notice the silver sedan as she was reentering the limo, but she sure felt rolling over the roof, smashing her left temple on the concrete first. She remembered her friend's screams, Jessica's drunken sobs.

Caleb pulled his hand back, once again concerned about getting to work. The Watcher disappeared into the crowd, having been pulled back by one of the elder Watchers riding a bicycle.

Good day at the office, uneventful as always. Weirdly empty as always. Caleb had never worked in a cubicle farm where only one cubicle was in use, all the others occupied with Watchers pretending to work computers. Caleb knew it must be that way, though, so he ignored it, making sure his clients were taken care of.

"Christina! Baby! Christina!" Christina jolted awake. "Baby! You're gonna be late for school!"

"Uhmrhh I'm coming!" Christina hollered, before slamming her face back into her pillow. Just ten more minutes.

Caleb inhaled deeply from his bong, holding his breath as long as he could before he exhaled. He offered it to the Watcher staying in his home, his "roommate" of sorts. As usual, the Watcher turned down the bong, and Caleb was already lifting it back to his own lips.

"Now, honey! Don't make me come upstairs and get you!"

Caleb watched TV with his roommate, double fisting his bong in one hand, a bottle of beer in the other. The Watcher watched, occasionally sprouting appendages, sometimes making beautiful sculptures only to dissolve them back into his torso. One such sculpture sprouted from his neck, a surprisingly big silver sedan, which only seemed to continue growing.

Caleb watched in horror as the sedan sprouted an entire world, a street, a building, crowds of students, a limousine, a cute red dress fell from Christina's body, then Jessica's hand, harshly yanking Christina into the limousine.

Metal scraped on metal, screeching black paint onto the silver vehicle. Christina's left ankle screamed, fire traced up her calf.

Students entered hysterics, several others treated not as gently as Christina.

Christina grabbed her ankle in panic, trying to face it the right way again.
