Gobs of a slimy, silver-blue mucus dripped from the fleshy mass. It gripped a still damp umbrella in much the stance of an old lady waiting at a bus stop, regardless of its imposing eight feet of grey, elephant-like flesh. It wore a top hat and a manacle, which dangled from a chain on his breast coat at the moment. The breast coat surely used to fit, yet now the torso and midriff bulged, only held by the most persistent threads.

It seemed to prefer animal products, first engulfing a few cartons of eggs via a gaping maw situated where eyes usually would have been. Next came uncooked bacon, chicken, chuck beef, milk, and occasional green slivers (it had a penchant for parsley).

"Feed.. must eat." The hulk had a high and whiny voice, blowing the air through his thin reedy trachea.

In the minute this all occurred, I honestly forgot about Charlie.. It's hard to even write, but there's no one that could read this anyway. There's no one I have left.

So.. Charlie came stumbling into the room, his goofy face in his usual happy smile. His long arthritic joints slowed him. Charlie saw me still in the hallway looking into the kitchen and approached me from the living room that also connected to the kitchen. God, I'll draw a little sketch so it's clear.

When Charlie was within a few feet of the thing, it didn't even turn around. It's arms jerked backward in their sockets. The bones audibly broke as they bent at odd angles. It snatched up Charlie. Before engulfing my old friend, it smashed Charlie once against the wall, leaving a large crater in the drywall and striking several two by fours cleanly in two.

And.. honestly I ran. I'm sorry, Charlie. I'm so so sorry.

I'm sorry Lisa. I'm sorry Emma. I'm so sorry Robert.

Please, God, help me. Please. Make this right, Lord.

Please bring my babies back--
