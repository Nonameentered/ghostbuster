"No no no no no..." John continued muttering, slowly crouching as he gripped his hair tightly. "No. That was real!" The tears flowed freely. "Theresa was real. Bobby and Ashton and Riley and Sarah were real!" John gave Ian a crazed look that scared him.

John erupted in a fresh wave of sobs. Ian took a seat in one of the chairs and put his face in his hands, not wanting John to see his tears.

"I'm sorry, Theresa. I'm sorry. Why didn't I do more? Every day. Every day I felt like I was burdened, like I was slogging through mud. It was always so close to when I worked, or I just worked, or I was just tired, and I was always *so* tired, I think. Honestly, I don't even know if I was actually tired or struggling, or just a lazy, fat fuck." John stopped for a moment before regarding his left hand, staring at his fingers close. He rapidly breathed several hiccupy gasps, his chest bouncing up and down.

John gently twisted his pointer finger and thumb around his ring finger, as he had done for the previous twenty-seven years. He felt the fresh, young skin on his wrist, missing the tower of dates for his anniversary and the birth of each of his beautiful children. He reached up to adjust his glasses and found none. His neck was void of its locket, the photo of his family inside, worn at the insistence of his youngest daughter, despite the heckling he received from the young boys at the office.

John panicked. "Where is something to write with? Find me something to write with!" His voice carried the hysterics of a teenage tantrum.

Ian found a pen and an old composition notebook that was mostly filled in.

John wrote. Addresses, phone numbers, names, dates, and events. He wrote as fast as his cramping hands would allow, ever cognizant of the approaching assassin.

He grew even more aware of his vapid memory, recoiling from John's touch as he tried to reach further into the depths, to remember his family and friends, to maybe find them again someday.

Thus, tears flowed as he scribbled, as he remembered four children but not his fifth's name, only that the child existed and it was a boy, and it was probably the third or fourth child born. He began with his wife, knowing she would be required to begin any of this again.

The fragments shrank further and further until John could scarcely remember why he was in this history room with the teacher lecturing as if John and Ian were not there.

John simply remembered this composition book was of utmost importance.

He stuck many sticky notes on the notebook before writing "JOHN - READ THIS"  in black bold text.

The class began laughing; a jokester was pointing a handheld laser pointer between the teacher's eyeballs.

The earth clapped. The scent of copper filled the room.
