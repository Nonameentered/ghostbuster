It was like watching a dog chase a squirrel or a mouse. If the dog isn't a real hunting dog, or doesn't have that kill instinct, you'll see it get real run real close to the lil rodent, but it won't close its jaws on its warm flesh and shake, like it would with so many of its squeaky plastic companions inside. Instead it'll get very close before slowing down, ensuring the chase continues, ensuring that the unfortunate lab rat has to keep *playing.*

Terrance and August maintained a jog through the main road of the street. Large metal facades barricaded all alley exits, criss crossed with yellow police tape and caution signs.

Large red lines were painted along the weathering gray bricks of the surrounding buildings, ending in an arrow that Terrance and August will not be able to see for quite some time.

The pursuing humans were clad in cotton, hefting household bludgeoning objects, primarily hammers, maintained a distance of approximately ten yards, one single first down.

An excited young couple ran apart from the crowd, eager to get a special scare into these savage bastards.

The young man barred his teeth, giving August the most perverted look he could muster as he sprinted closer, very rapidly turning the ten yards into second and inches.

August heard the young man's scream, and turned on his left heel to look over his left shoulder. Doing this moved him to his left maybe half a foot as he ran, enough to land his descending heel half on the curb and half off.

His leg plunged anyway, and August went sprawling, hitting his left temple hard on the curb.

Terrance yelped a quick apology and goodbye, feeling like such a fool for waking up the homeless guy for help. Why had he done that? Why didn't he let the man sleep?

Terrance doubled his pace as much as he could, waves of nostalgia slapping his face like cold air as he passed the Braum's he had his first date at (sadly), the little arcade he and the boys spent most nights at, the little county clerk office his mom worked most nights, sometimes bringing him home a little lollipop.

Terrance had begun tearing up when he noticed the lack of noise. He turned to see the street void of human life.

"Oh, shucks, Albert. Whyn you goin n' doin that man?" Albert's cousin, Gerald chewed his cigar as he spoke, the young twenty somethin kid sporting side burns that went down to combine with the rest of his beard along with curly light brown hair and hazel eyes. His face had a kinda softness to it, though it was mostly the plump cheeks.

"Yeah, man. Now we gotta like, call the doctor, I guess. Goddamn it, Albert! We were only like a few more hours from the big reveal!" This time it was Albert's sister who shamed him. She took small nibbles of a Slim Jim as she berated her idiot brother. "You know we can only rent this street out for a few more hours."

Albert's sister, Clara, looked to a few other family members in the crowd, silently accusing them. Clara tried so hard, so so hard to bottle up the hate, to just let Albert fuck it up. Let him ruin this, like her eighth birthday (dumbass dropped the cake), her quincea√±era (showed up piss drunk), even her recent bachelorette party (for some reason went to the same club as the girlies).

Clara brought her shoulders back and stood up straight and tall.

"Albert, leave."

"Hey, sis, let's talk-"

"Albert, I didn't want you to come. I didn't want to invite you. I don't want you around. Not here, not last month at my wedding, or at the baby shower, or at my birthday party, or my future kids events. You have somehow managed to fuck up or make every event in my entire life about you." Clara and Albert's parents made small utterances of opposition but were silenced by Clara's gaze. "And I put up with it for mom and dad, but that has been twenty six years too long."

"Get the fuck out of here, Albert." Clara stared into Albert's eyes. Her eyebrows formed harsh angles towards her piercing, also hazel eyes, the same as Albert's mother's eyes. "I can't believe you've managed to ruin a fucking lynching. Lose my phone number."

Clara ranted on the phone with one of her girlies for two hours while downing about half a bottle of wine.

The doctor was able to save August; mild concussion.
