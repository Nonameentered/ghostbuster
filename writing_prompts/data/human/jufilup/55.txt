A large metal door stood on one side of the hospital room. The walls were made of an alloy several meters thick. Even the bed was made of the same alloy, consisting of a solid metal cube protruding from the ground with a cotton stuffed mattress on top.

No tools or potential weapons of any kind were kept in the containment facility, including any glass windows, even bulletproof glass.

Hanson and his men discussed what was to be done with the loose cannon with immense power and so little time.

Hanson himself and a few others argued that death was prime; this man could not be trusted to roam the streets with the ability to kill millions. If he was coopted by the enemy, the damage would be unimaginable. Another group wanted to become his ally, to allow him to live and maybe service the community for a couple years; a kind of temporary superman situation.

Unfortunately, Hanson was proved right, though maybe due to their own mistake.

The man had been agonizing for hours, certain they would use him in a human experiment, and decided he would have to unleash his power to try to escape.

Again, unfortunately, the man could not withstand the force of his attack, and his body was ripped apart, leaving an enormous pile of pink, white, and red flesh scattered about the room.

The explosion careened into the room Hanson debated in. The pressure first caved the eyes in of every man in the area, swiftly followed by the rest of their bodies.
