\[Family Business\]

"Hey, Andy," the familiar voice pulled Andrew's focus from the floor he was mopping. He looked up to see the boss' daughter, Monday, and an unknown friend. He kept his eyes on Monday. She was a pale, rainbow-haired teen girl that wore a crisp white blazer. She carried a thick book with a rainbow cover beneath one arm. Even though he wore his visor, it was still standard procedure to not look anyone in the eyes. Gorgons and other mischievous magic users frequented the hotel. The white translucent visor over his eyes offered some protection; but, he'd seen it fail before.
  
 
  
"Good morning, Monday, who's your friend?" Andrew asked. He had a fair amount of respect and loyalty for Monday and her mother, Alicia. He always felt treated with respect and like a valued member of the staff.
  
 
  
"This is Tessa," Monday said. "She's won't turn you to stone or anything," she added.
  
 
  
"Hi," Tessa waved. Andrew returned the wave with a smile. She was about Monday's age with tan skin and short brown hair.
  
 
  
"She's helping me search the hotel. Have you seen any books that look like this?" Monday asked. She held the book out to give him a closer view. Andrew studied the glossy rainbow cover for a moment, then shook his head.
  
 
  
"I sure haven't," Andrew shook his head. "But, you'll be the first to know if I find one," he added. Monday also shook her head.
  
 
  
"Do me a favor. If you find one, destroy it before you report it to me. I don't want to risk anyone else getting ahold of it if you try to keep it for me."
  
 
  
"Is it dangerous?" Andrew asked. Monday half-nodded and shrugged at the same time.
  
 
  
"It has the potential to ruin my life," she said. "You're not in any danger from touching it; just please destroy it. Then send me a report to tell me where you found it."
  
 
  
"You have my word," Andrew nodded. After working at the hotel for six months, he'd gotten used to getting vague orders. The no-eye-contact rule was easy enough to understand. But, he still had no idea why he was sending people to the third floor when asked about the pool. He was forbidden from setting foot on the third floor and he was paid enough to not be curious.
  
 
  
"Thanks, Andy," Monday smiled. "I really appreciate your work ethic and loyalty. I'll make sure mom gives you a bonus," she said. She patted him on the shoulder as the two girls started walking down the hall. "We're going to go keep looking," she said.
  
 
  
"Good luck to you," Andrew replied with a wave. Then, he returned to his work once they turned the corner out of sight. He dipped the mop in the bucket and wrung it out. He'd only made a couple of swipes before he was interrupted again. This time by a different, familiar voice.
  
 
  
"Andrew," Alicia said. He looked up immediately. His boss was a lean, pale vampire woman with long black hair. 
  
 
  
"Yes, Ma'am?" he replied.
  
 
  
"I noticed Monday stopped to chat with you. What did she need?" she asked.
  
 
  
"She's looking for a book," he replied.
  
 
  
"Oh? What kind of book?"
  
 
  
"A binder?" he shrugged as he answered. "She had one already and she's looking for more. It might have been a photo album. The cover was a rainbow."
  
 
  
"And what did she tell you to do with it if you found one?" Alicia asked. Andrew briefly wondered if Monday had meant to keep it a secret. But, he decided that she would have mentioned it if that were the case.
  
 
  
"Destroy it, then report it to her," he answered.
  
 
  
"I see...," she sighed. "I'm sorry to rope you into this Andrew," she said. "But, it seems that deed is already done. I'm going to ask that you turn the book over to me, should you happen to find one. After you give it to me, you may report to her that it has been destroyed."
  
 
  
"Ma'am?" Andrew was surprised. "I'm supposed to lie to Monday?"
  
 
  
"My daughter is keeping secrets from me," Alicia nodded solemnly. "[It started in our home](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/xkbocl/wp_you_are_short_on_money_and_decide_to_get_a_job/), and now she's doing it at work. I need to know if it's something worth worrying about." She met Andrew's eyes. "You work for me, not my family," she said.
  
 
  
"Yes, Ma'am," Andrew nodded. He hated having to choose sides; but, it was an easy decision. "You have my word."
