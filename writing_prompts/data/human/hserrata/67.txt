\[Fluttering Introduction\] 

Glorii sighed in relief as she crossed the threshold. Her black cloth armor and weapons disintegrated into white powder. She continued walking in the jeans and t-shirt she normally wore. The thick red line separated the dim dungeon behind her from the gleaming white rest area. The pit stop was larger than she expected. It was a bustling plaza with several merchants selling food, supplies, repairs, and upgrades. She saw dozens of other strangers in groups and alone coming in and out of the many doorways. Glorii counted six entrances before she was distracted by something else. A young woman with deep green curls entered the pit stop alongside a towering pale woman with bright red hair.
  
 
  
"I need to ask...," Glorii giggled to herself as she changed direction to meet the pair of women. She was drawn to them because the green-haired woman looked almost exactly like her. Glorii's own hair was a lighter shade of green and not as curly; but, there was no mistaking her features. The unknown woman had the same high cheeks and rounded chin that she saw in the mirror every morning.
  
 
  
As she made her way through the crowd the women split up. Glorii turned and followed the green-haired one to a stall. She caught up to her as the stranger picked out vegetables and placed them on the counter to purchase.
  
 
  
"Hi," Glorii smiled at the stranger. She turned and immediately returned the exact same smile.
  
 
  
"Hi," she said.
  
 
  
"Um,.. you're me, right? I mean, from another universe?" The stranger nodded with a giggle.
  
 
  
"I think that's pretty likely," she said. "I'm Gloryanna," she introduced herself with an extended hand and Glorii shook it.
  
 
  
"My name's Glorii," she said.
  
 
  
"Are you new to the multiverse?" she asked. Glorii nodded.
  
 
  
"I met Mundo last night and I had to come exploring as soon as possible. Luckily, I got the day off from work," she replied.
  
 
  
"Oh, you're going to have so much fun," Gloryanna replied. "Are you on any quests, or just exploring? I'm a Chef, what class are you?"
  
 
  
"I'm a Ninja. No quests yet," Glorii shook her head. "I kind of wanted to get the hang of things first," she said. Gloryanna nodded.
  
 
  
"Yup, I know how that goes," she said. "What dungeon are you in?" Glorii's smile dimmed a bit in confusion.
  
 
  
"This one...?" she asked. Gloryanna smiled but shook her head. She turned and pointed at the entrance she used.
  
 
  
"That's the dungeon I came in from; you see the text above it?" Glorii did notice the red and white text at each archway at first; but, there was so much to see that her mind dismissed it as an 'EXIT' sign. But, now that she looked closer she saw it was a combination of letters and numbers. She looked back to try and find the one she used; but, they all looked so similar that she couldn't tell them apart without knowing the four-character code.
  
 
  
"Oh no, I hadn't noticed. I don't know which one I came through...," Glorii said.
  
 
  
"That's okay," Gloryanna replied. "Your node knows," she pulled her own node out of her pocket and held it up in front of Glorii. A red arrow pointed at the same entrance that Gloryanna indicated. "They're all different universes," she said.
  
 
  
"Really?" Glorii was impressed. After meeting Mundo she knew most of what there was to know about the multiverse; but, that was only in theory. She never considered what mastered multiverse travel might look like in practice. She pulled her own node out and the red arrow pointed at an archway.
  
 
  
"Pit stops like this one are kind of a pocket universe themselves," Gloryanna nodded. "Instead of having one in every dungeon, they just connect to here. It also helps the merchants and crafters get in and out without going through any actual danger."
  
 
  
"But, you're a crafter?" Glorii asked. "You're a Chef? You came in through the dungeon." Gloryanna nodded again.
  
 
  
"My wife brings me along for the food buffs," she grinned. "She's a Paladin and does a great job of keeping me safe."
  
 
  
"Wife?" Glorii remembered the giant redhead that walked in with Gloryanna.
  
 
  
"Here she is," Gloryanna turned and waved as the woman joined them. She was almost twice Gloryanna's height and easily twice as broad. She had pale skin and hands as big as Glorii's head. "Glorii, this is my wife, Flutter," she introduced them.
  
 
  
"Hi," Flutter smiled. "It's always nice to meet another one of you."
  
 
  
"Flutter?" The name sounded familiar. She was sure that Mundo mentioned it but there was so much information given that she couldn't quite remember the context.
  
 
  
"She's the best Paladin in the AlterNet," Gloryanna said. She straightened her back with pride. "You've probably heard of her."
  
 
  
"I have, I think," Glorii replied. "Nice to meet you," she added.
  
 
  
"Why don't you join us?" Gloryanna asked. "You're still new, so we can teach you a few things. And, you'll be safe with Flutter around."
  
 
  
"I'd like that," Glorii nodded.
  
 
  
"Let me just finish restocking some ingredients," Gloryanna said. She turned back to the vendor, but Flutter kept her attention on Glorii.
  
 
  
"What's your Earth like," she asked.
  
 
  
"It's a pretty normal 21st century Earth," she said. "Except we have vampires, and other Fae, I'm told." Up until she met Mundo, she never considered the idea of an Earth without vampires. But, apparently, hers was somewhat unusual.
  
 
  
"Oh, nice, ever meet a fairy?" Flutter asked. Glorii shook her head.
  
 
  
"Only vampires," she said.
  
 
  
"Well...," Flutter winked down at her. As she did, two pairs of translucent insect wings popped out of her back. "...you have now."
