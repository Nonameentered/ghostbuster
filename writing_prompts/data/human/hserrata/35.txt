\[Axe. Questions.\] 

"Nononononono...," Ranger Rocky held his arms out for balance as he stumbled down the sharp hill. He was used to unexpected terrain and managed to move his legs fast enough to stay on top of them. He reached level ground at the bottom and stood still for a moment just to be sure. Finally, he sighed in relief and took in his new surroundings. He found himself in a long, narrow valley. The bottom was covered with long green grass and dozens of upright stones. They were organized uniformly in a way that reminded Rocky of a cemetery. As interesting as that was, he was more surprised by the group of four teenagers sitting nearby; three girls and a boy.
  
 
  
"Hi!" a silver-haired teenage girl spoke up as they all focused on Rocky. She stood to greet him.
  
 
  
"Wait! Not yet!" The lean, blue-haired teenage boy stopped her as they all stood. As he wondered what he was suddenly waiting for, he noted how strange their outfits were. The boy wore a long black robe with blue trim around the sleeves and neck. The silver-haired girl wore a normal t-shirt and blue jeans, but she wore black gloves and a silver box strapped to her wrist. One girl with pink highlights in her brunette hair wore a dark purple ninja garb. The last girl with short, violet hair wore a stylish black and white vest with a dress shirt and slacks. And, for some reason, she also sported a long, loose measuring tape draped around her neck. All in all, the group appeared to be dressed for different occasions.
  
 
  
As he studied their appearance, the boy seemed to be wiggling his fingers at nothing in the space in front of him. Finally, he turned to the silver-haired girl and nodded.
  
 
  
"Okay, ready," he said.
  
 
  
"Hi," the girl repeated. She stepped forward to Rocky with an outstretched hand. "My name's Emily. That's Surge, Alis, and Vivi," she introduced the rest of the group by gesturing at the boy, then the ninja, and finally the seamstress. Despite her friendly introduction and offered handshake, she seemed to make a point of stopping out of reach.
  
 
  
"Ranger Rocky, " he introduced himself and took a step to shake her hand. \*CRUNCH\* Rocky felt something break under his boot before he reached her.
  
 
  
"Huh?" he looked down to check what it was and he found white jagged fragments. He lifted his foot more and saw the other half of the skull he destroyed. Then, the ground began to rumble. Emily turned and pointed at the row of headstones. Each one now had a skeleton climbing out of the ground in front of it.
  
 
  
"You kinda desecrated a Viking burial ground and released an ancient evil," Emily replied.
  
 
  
"What?" Rocky asked. He wasn't even sure what he was asking about anymore. The only thing he knew was that he didn't have enough answers.
  
 
  
"Incoming," Alis said. She put volume in her voice to get their attention, but she did not shout. She barely sounded concerned about the first handful of Viking skeletons shambling toward the group.
  
 
  
"Go ahead," Surge nodded at Alis. "It's not one of those," he said.
  
 
  
"On it," Alis nodded. Then, a plume of bright pink smoke erupted around her. Several more puffs of pink smoke popped into existence around the group of skeletons. Rocky caught the notable scent of bubblegum in the air. The initial burst of smoke cleared to reveal Alis still standing there. When the rest of the smoke cleared the skeletons were strung together in a bundle by a shining thread. Alis raised her hand forward and launched a pink fireball at the skeletons.
  
 
  
The flaming projectile hit the writhing, undead bundle and spread to all of them. The pink bonfire blossomed for a moment then faded. It left behind only white ash.
  
 
  
"Who are you kids?" Rocky asked. He assumed the danger was over but quickly realized he was wrong when Alis called out again.
  
 
  
"Second wave," she said. Rocky turned and saw another group of bones approaching. This time, one stood out from the rest of the pack. One was notably taller than the others, even with their horned helmets on, and he carried a hand-axe that glowed green.
  
 
  
"That's him, right?" Alis asked as she pointed at the taller skeleton. Surge nodded.
  
 
  
"String them up again; but, don't kill them this time," he said. Alis nodded, then she turned to Vivi.
  
 
  
"I'm out of thread," she said. Vivi nodded and tossed her a thick spool of silver thread. "Thanks," she grinned and bubblegum smoke erupted around her again. This time, Rocky knew what to expect and he focused on the encroaching undead. This time, he caught glimpses of Alis appearing at every puff of smoke and he spotted the metallic thread in the sunlight as it tightened around the skeletons. "Done," Alis spoke up again from her initial spot by the group as the smoke cleared.
  
 
  
"Thanks," Surge said. He strode forward to face the entangled skeletons and stopped in front of the tallest one. He casually reached forward and pulled the glowing axe out of its hand. The group of bones fell into an inanimate pile as soon as the axe was free. Surge spun around and held the axe up as he returned to the group. "Got it!" he grinned.
  
 
  
"That's it?" Alis asked.
  
 
  
"I didn't even get to heal anyone...," Emily said. Surge nodded and shrugged.
  
 
  
"I got lucky," he said. "The waves keep getting harder and the axe can appear during any of them. We would've definitely needed to try harder starting at around wave seven; there can be up to 20 total." 
  
 
  
"So... what now?" Vivi asked. Surge shrugged.
  
 
  
"I thought this would take longer, I've got no other plans today," he said.
  
 
  
"Same," Alis added. "Anything you all want to do?" She directed the question to Emily and Vivi. After a moment of silence, Vivi nodded.
  
 
  
"Haunted house?" she asked.
  
 
  
"YES!" Emily cheered.
  
 
  
"Sure," Alis nodded and she raised her hand to wiggle her fingers at the air. A tall black portal opened and Surge was the first one in, followed by Vivi.
  
 
  
"Wait!" Rocky grabbed Emily by the shoulder as she walked by. "Where are you going? Who are you? What's going on??" he asked.
  
 
  
"We're leaving," She shrugged. "We're playing a game," she added as if that answered the rest of his questions.
  
 
  
"Leaving?" Rocky asked. "But..what about the ancient evil?" he asked. He kept looking towards the grave markers just in case more skeletons appeared.
  
 
  
"Taken care of," Emily answered. "Don't worry about it." Alis had already left through the portal.
  
 
  
"But...," Rocky couldn't deny that the trouble seemed to have ended. "... what if it happens again?" he asked. Emily giggled.
  
 
  
"It will," she said. She pulled free of his grip and entered the portal. It disappeared along with her as Rocky heard her last comment. "Surge mentioned that you trigger the event every day."
