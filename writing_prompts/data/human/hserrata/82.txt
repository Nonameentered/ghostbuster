\[Cheap Friend\]

"Oh good, I can restock," Joyce crossed paths with the merchant and decided to take advantage of the coincidence. Her other option was returning to town to unload and restock and the wasted time would limit her dungeon runs. The merchant was a pale, rainbow-haired teen in a crisp white blazer. The \[Merchant\] tag floated over her head and made her easy to identify even if her wares weren't obvious.
  
 
  
"Hello, Merchant," Joyce smiled at the teen. She stopped and returned the smile. "Are you available to trade?" Joyce asked. The teen nodded.
  
 
  
"Always. How may I help you?" she asked.
  
 
  
"I'd like to sell my junk and restock a few healing items," she said. As Joyce answered, the two exchanged their nodes. Joyce looked at the list of items on the node and quickly identified the potions and charms she wanted to restock. She tapped on her choices to highlight them, then browsed the list to see if anything else caught her interest. Then, she saw \[Friendship\] on the list. Though, unlike the rest of the items, it had no price next to it. Instead, it had two categories. "Monthly" and "Lifetime".
  
 
  
"What's Friendship?" she asked. The teen smirked at her.
  
 
  
"The power of Friendship," the merchant grinned. "If you buy that, I'll be your friend. For a month at a time, or a lifetime," she said. "Your lifetime," she added.
  
 
  
"Okay...," Joyce nodded. Merchants were known for being eccentric and often selling anything they could get someone to buy. "...so, why do I want you as a friend?"  The teen winked at Joyce.
  
 
  
"Friends get 30% discounts at my shop," she said. "And, If I'm your friend, all my friends are your friend too. I have some very powerful friends."
  
 
  
"Ohh...," Joyce nodded in understanding. "So, it's like a discount club type thing? How much is the monthly fee?" she asked.
  
 
  
"One billion," the teen said. Joyce's eyes opened wide in shock.
  
 
  
"One billion nanos? A month? Are you serious???" The merchant nodded.
  
 
  
"Well, obviously the goal is to sell you the lifetime plan," she giggled. "But, considering Sharp Development would be one of your friends, the monthly plan is still a solid value."
  
 
  
"Sharp Development?" Joyce asked. The corporation essentially ran the multiverse. Getting 'friendly discounts' on Sharp Development products meant she would literally be getting a discount on everything. Anything she could imagine from a fast-food franchise to medical care and banking services were provided by the company. Not to mention grocery stores and even municipal utilities. That alone was definitely worth the monthly asking price. But, it was also ridiculous to not take the lifetime plan. Joyce assumed it was cheaper, or at least easier to manage.
  
 
  
"So, how much for the lifetime plan?" she asked.
  
 
  
"Technically, it won't even cost you a nano," the merchant grinned. "Joining the lifetime plan is more of a commitment than a simple payment."
  
 
  
"Oh," Joyce nodded. "I get it. So I'm your 'friend' too?" she said. She imagined a pretty simple loophole. All she had to do was not sell anyone anything and she didn't have to give discounts to anyone. Which, was easy; she wasn't a merchant.
  
 
  
"Something like that," the teen nodded. She pulled a red, translucent clipboard out of thin air. It was already loaded with a form and she presented it to Joyce. "You commit by signing your soul over to Sharp Development," she said.
  
 
  
"My... soul?"  Joyce asked. She was more surprised than she should have been. In the back of her mind, she was aware that Sharp Development traded in souls. The fact was never hidden but easily ignored. "Does that mean I go to Hell when I die?"
  
 
  
"Only in a very technical sense," the merchant replied. "It's called 'Hell' but it's nothing like you've heard. Sharp Development has created its own Afterlife, including its own version of Hell. It's not the torturous sulfur and brimstone that you're probably thinking of. And it's not for all eternity."
  
 
  
"So.. why do I have to go at all?" Joyce asked. "If Sharp Development created an Afterlife, why did they set it up like that?" It was a genuine question. The company she was familiar with was extremely humanitarian. They did unbelievable charity work and always made sure their products were top quality, their prices were low, and their employees were happy. They didn't seem like a company that would willingly send their customers to Hell.
  
 
  
"Even though Ms. Sharp created her own Afterlife, there are still rules that determine what qualifies as an 'Afterlife'. She had to make some concessions in her design."
  
 
  
"Oh...," Joyce nodded. "That makes sense." It made enough sense for her to let the topic go. She didn't feel the need to press further about whose rules those were. She signed her name on the form and gave Sharp Development ownership of her soul. The company was a constant, reliable presence as she grew up. She regarded it like a trusted parent and this was no different. "I'm in," she returned the clipboard with a smile.
  
 
  
"Thanks!" the teen said. She accepted the clipboard and her own node as she returned Joyce's node to her. "My name's Monday, by the way," she added.
  
 
  
"I'm Joyce," she introduced herself too. "Wait," she checked her new balance after Monday bought her junk items. It hadn't gone up nearly as much as she expected.
  
 
  
"You didn't buy all my junk?" she asked. She scrolled through the list but did not see any junk tags.
  
 
  
"No, I did," Monday nodded. Her smirk grew into a wide grin. "We're friends now," she said. "I got a discount."
