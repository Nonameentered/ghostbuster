\[First: Impossible\]

"And now I shall make this man DISAPPEAR!" Peter chuckled to himself as he heard the magician's voice on the other side. He wondered how the teen would pull the trick off, she didn't give him any instructions as she sealed him in the coffin-like box. He had to admit he was impressed with her act so far. She performed a myriad of card tricks before asking for a volunteer; and, she kept the audience engaged the whole time. If nothing else, Emily the Entertainer lived up to her stage name. Despite the box being pitch black inside, he thought he imagined it getting darker somehow when she promised to make him disappear. Then, he shut his eyes. Bright, white light filled his vision and he wasn't ready for it.
  
 
  
"You're safe, don't panic," a voice spoke up and he tried peeking his eyes open.
  
 
  
"Who said that?" The light felt easier on his eyes now and he squinted to look around. The box was gone and he stood in a wide open, white room. A digital timer on the wall was counting down in red digits. A young girl with short violet hair sat nearby sewing something by hand. She looked to be about Emily's age, and her first words were reassuring even if he didn't know where he was. "Is this part of the trick?" he added once he saw her. She nodded and pointed at the clock.
  
 
  
"You have about 10 minutes to wait before she ends the show and pulls you back, 'the girl said. She set down the silvery cloth she was working on and approached him. There wasn't a table when he noticed her. But, as she leaned forward to set her things down, a small white table formed up from the floor. Her chair disintegrated into white dust when she stood. "My name's Vivi, what's yours?"
  
 
  
"Peter," he answered. "Where am I exactly?"
  
 
  
"It's not worth going into in-depth," she shrugged. "It won't matter in 10 minutes. But, what will matter is this," she offered him a transparent glass card. "Congratulations. For participating in Emily's trick you get a free pass to the multiverse; it's called a node."
  
 
  
"The... multiverse?" Peter accepted the card; the time appeared on the transparent display in red numbers once he touched it. He had to admit it was impressive technology. He looked around the white room again, then swiped up on the node out of habit. It unlocked to show him a red scissor logo and a handful of icons; one was labeled 'tutorial'.  "...am I in a parallel universe???" he asked.
  
 
  
"Ehhhh," Vivi wiggled her hand in a so-so gesture. "It's a hair more complicated than that; but, you're not on the same Earth where the show is taking place," she answered. "Once you do the tutorial you'll be able to travel the multiverse and set up your own spaces like this one," she said. "But, it takes longer than the time you have left; so don't start it now," she added.
  
 
  
"Oh, okay...," Peter nodded. He glanced at the timer and still had almost eight minutes to kill. "...so I can just have this?" he asked. "You don't know anything about me, what if I cause trouble?" Peter preferred to keep himself on the straight and narrow; it was part of why the question came to mind at all. He was immediately worried about how others might misuse it. Vivi laughed and shook her head.
  
 
  
"You're one person out of an infinite amount of humans, how much trouble could you cause?"
  
 
  
"I can go to different universes freely now, right? It's not like one-time use or anything?" Peter asked. Vivi nodded. "So, what's to stop me from taking advanced technology from one world to another and selling it?" Vivi shrugged.
  
 
  
"Nothing," Vivi answered. "But, you wouldn't be the first nor the last, I'm sure," she giggled.
  
 
  
"But... what if I commit crimes on one Earth and hide out in another?" Vivi shook her head with a grin, then she turned and walked back to the table with her cloth.
  
 
  
"There are several organizations that track that sort of thing; and, there are plenty of unsolved mysteries on every Earth every year. You might get caught, you might not," she said. Vivi picked up her sewing and sat down again. To Peter, it appeared that the table and chair swapped places; the table disintegrated while the chair caught Vivi. "Either way, you wouldn't be the first."
  
 
  
"But...," Peter's mind refused to accept that the ability to travel between universes was given away so casually. It was too powerful to fall into the wrong hands and he took it upon himself to prove it to Vivi. He knew he wasn't 'the wrong hands'; but, maybe it would make her think more carefully about it in the future. "... what if I take over a whole Earth? Enslave the people with advanced technology and started taking over other Earths?" Vivi grinned to herself as she moved the needle through the silver cloth.
  
 
  
"Well, let me ask you that. What if you do? How do you see that scenario playing out?"
  
 
  
"Start with one Earth, then two, then four... with the right moves a person could conquer the whole multiverse."
  
 
  
"Uhuh," Vivi nodded. She kept her eyes on him while she sewed absent-mindedly. "So, you think a single person is capable of conquering...," she paused for effect, then stressed the last word. "...infinity?"
  
 
  
Her phrasing finally made Peter understand. No matter what he did, he was a single point in an endless universe. No matter how many Earths he conquered, he would still have countless Earths that were not under his control. In the context of infinity, it simply didn't matter what he did. It didn't matter what anyone did; no one being could affect the multiverse in any notable way.
  
 
  
"Oh...," Peter nodded in understanding. He glanced at the timer and had less than 10 seconds left. He didn't know what would happen; but, he imagined all he had to do was stay still.  "...I get it," he said. Vivi nodded with a giggle; but, she misunderstood his realization.
  
 
  
"You got it..," she nodded. Everything went black around him suddenly, but, he heard Vivi's last comment before Emily opened the box. "..you wouldn't be the first."
