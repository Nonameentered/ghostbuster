\[Service at a Premium\]

Nancy was surprised as she sat down in front of the rainbow-haired teen. She didn't look old enough to legally have a job; but, by now she'd learned that Sharp Development was a company that was full of surprises. The corporation was behind the greatest technology that Nancy had ever seen. Thanks to them, she owned and managed her own world now. And, she wasn't the only one. But, while it was exciting to control weather patterns, or try and nurture a civilization at first, she was starting to grow bored. Nothing happened in her world without her permission. That meant nothing surprising or novel ever happened. She had too much control.
  
 
  
After complaining to one of her friends, he recommended visiting a Sharp Development branch. Her friend explained that he'd found himself equally bored. The company helped him spice things up; though, he was prohibited from giving her too many details. But, he told her where to go, and she trusted him.
  
 
  
"Hello, Nancy, My name's Monday," the teen smiled once she sat.
  
"What can Sharp Development do for you?"
  
 
  
"I don't know...," Nancy shrugged. "My friend said to tell you that I'm bored...,"
  
 
  
"Ah, I understand," Monday nodded. "That happens quite often to our players that have their own Server. May I see your node, please?" she asked. She extended her hand across the desk with her palm up and Nancy nodded. She pulled the transparent glass card out of her purse and gave it to Monday.
  
 
  
Once she had it, Monday brought the node closer to inspect it. At the same moment, a solid white visor appeared over her eyes. She studied the node for a moment, then she nodded. The visor disappeared and she set the node on the desk between them.
  
 
  
"The good news is, you bought our premium package; so, I'm able to help you. Though, I will ask you not to mention anything of what you learn to anyone. It could affect our business," she added.
  
 
  
"Okay," Nancy nodded. Her closest friend already knew what she was going to learn anyway. There was no one else she really talked to.
  
 
  
"As I'm sure you're aware, your Server is not the only one. There are millions of Earth-sized Servers available, and many of them are run by players like you," Monday said. Nancy nodded. She knew there were other ones, but she never put much thought into it. She was usually busy running her own world.
  
 
  
"It's something we don't advertise as much as we used to; but, over 90% of Servers are all connected to a single network called the AlterNet." Nancy's eyes clouded with slight confusion, but she did not interrupt. Monday continued.
  
 
  
"If you join, you would still be in control of your own Server. But, connecting to the AlterNet allows other players to visit your Earth and explore it. Instead of making decisions for your own entertainment, you're trying to attract players. You'll have the opportunity to design quests, create Dark Lords, and so on. A lot of our players enjoy competing for the attention of others that don't have their own Server yet. And of course, adding other players means there'll be some surprises from time to time."
  
 
  
"Oh...," Nancy nodded. "...that does sound interesting,"
  
 
  
"It can also be a little dangerous," Monday replied. "There are some players that are powerful enough to destroy Earths. But, you don't have to worry about that," Monday grinned.
  
 
  
"I... don't?" Nancy asked. She hadn't even considered that someone that powerful existed. But, apparently, it was common enough to mention.
  
 
  
"Your premium package comes with backup support. If someone does destroy your Earth, Sharp Development will restore the most recent backup free of charge. So, be sure to save often," she giggled.
  
 
  
"Oh, I will...," Nancy said.
  
 
  
"It's as easy as pressing a button," Monday said. "Although, it is a permanent change. Once you connect your Server to the AlterNet, you won't be able to go back to single-player mode anymore.
  
 
  
"That's not a problem," Nancy nodded. "It's too boring by myself. Yes, please. Connect me to the AlterNet." 
  
 
  
"Wonderful," Monday replied. A soft red glow appeared around the tip of her index finger and she touched the node. The red light drained out of her finger and washed over the transparent glass; then, it was gone.
  
 
  
"Congratulations, you're now part of the Alternet. You have 24 hours to make any changes before the doors open, so to speak," Monday said.
  
 
  
"Thank you!" Nancy took back the node while grinning. Her mind was filled with ideas on how to attract the most gamers to her Earth. She was excited to get started and stood up to leave.
  
 
  
"Is that.. it ?" she asked. Monday nodded with a smile. "Is there.. a fee or anything?"
  
 
  
"What kind of company do you think we are?" Monday laughed. "You bought the premium package, you're a V.I.P. around here. Besides...," Monday stood to guide Nancy out the door. "What could we even charge you? Sharp Development already owns your soul."
