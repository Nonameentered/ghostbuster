\[Flutter's Blessing\] 

"I call this one the Shifting Forest," the old man grinned. Frost, the blue-skinned teen boy sighed and shook his head when he heard the title. "Although not all of it might be true, I choose to believe it. The question is, will you?"
  
 
  
"No thanks," Frost stood up suddenly, The old man gave him a puzzled look as Frost turned and left the bar. After a few minutes, Frost walked back into the bar. It was mostly empty with only a handful of patrons. Frost noted one of them, a giant, pale, red-headed woman glanced up at him when he returned to sit at the bar. She sat alone in a dim corner.
  
 
  
Moments after Frost sat down, the old man landed on a seat next to him. He seemed to be having trouble staying on his feet and he was glad for the rest. He turned toward Frost and seemed thrilled to see him. His face lit up and a loose grin formed at the edges of his mouth as if he couldn't quite control his lips.
  
 
  
"Wanna hear a story boy?" the old man asked.
  
 
  
"Sure," Frost nodded.
  
 
  
"I call this one the Shifting Forest," he said. "Although not all of it-," Frost interrupted him by standing up again. He walked out of the bar then returned after a few minutes. Only the redhead seemed to notice him going in and out. This time, her gaze lingered and she smirked at him as he sat down. He wondered why.
  
 
  
"Wanna hear a story boy?" The old man appeared and interrupted his thoughts.
  
 
  
"Sure," Frost said.
  
 
  
"I call this one the Shifting Forest," the old man replied. "Although-'''
  
 
  
"C'mon!" Frost hopped off the stool in frustration, then he whirled around and headed for the door. "This is the last time...," he grumbled to himself as he walked out of the bar. This time, the redhead towered over the entrance when Frost walked back in. Frost was built on the broad side; he was an athletic 14-year-old. The redheaded woman was almost twice his height and almost twice as broad.
  
 
  
"Hi," she smiled at him with her hand extended. Her palm was almost as big as his face. "I'm Flutter," she said.
  
 
  
"Frost," he introduced himself out of habit but froze when he reached for her hand. "Flutter?? Wow..." he glanced up at her and subconsciously took a step back. He was in awe. He'd never met her; but, everyone knew of Flutter. She was recognized as the most powerful Paladin around. "What's up? What can I do for you?" he asked. She smirked and shook her head.
  
 
  
"I actually wanted to help you with something," she said. "That is... if you're looking for a divine blessing," she shrugged. Frost nodded eagerly with wide eyes.
  
 
  
"YES! How did you know??" he asked.
  
 
  
"I'm a paladin too," she winked at him with a giggle. Frost was immediately embarrassed that he hadn't put that together. Of course she knew what he was looking for, she'd probably done it too."
  
 
  
"Okay, so.. what do I do?" he asked. He was happy to let her take the lead.
  
 
  
"First, accept this," she said. Red text appeared in the bottom left of Frost's view.
  
 
  
\[Flutter invited you to a party. Join?\]
  
\[Yes\] \[No\] Frost accepted her invite.
  
 
  
"Then," she continued. "Go keep doing what you were doing," she tilted her head at the bar.
  
 
  
"Okay..," Frost nodded. He reached the bar and sat down on the same stool he'd been returning to.
  
 
  
"Wanna hear a story boy?" the old man wobbled to him and sat down on the next stool.
  
 
  
"Yes," Frost answered with more hope this time.
  
 
  
"I call this one the Blessing of Divinity. Although not all of it might be true,-"
  
 
  
"YES!" Frost wasn't listening to him anymore. He didn't need to. "I believe it!" he cheered. Red text in the bottom left-hand side of his vision read: \[Quest Accepted\]
  
 
  
"I'll be waitin' here to see if you make any progress," the old man nodded. Frost returned to Flutter with a broad grin.
  
 
  
"That worked! Thank you!" he said. Flutter nodded.
  
 
  
"I wasted too much of my own time trying to get it," she said. "Sometimes I'll hang around here and try to keep others from the same fate."
  
 
  
"Wow," Frost nodded. Everyone that talked about Flutter always mentioned how friendly she was. He was genuinely surprised at how accurate that sentiment turned out to be. "I really appreciate it, thank you," he said. Flutter shook her head.
  
 
  
"Don't thank me yet," she said. "If you want help, you can thank me after we finish the quest for you."
  
 
  
"You'll help me?" he asked. He'd planned on asking some of his friends for help once he got the quest. But, if Flutter was offering, he didn't need to bother his friends.
  
 
  
"Sure," she nodded. "I've done it a bunch of times now, it won't take long."
