\[Illuminating Questions\]

Grant stopped walking when his light landed on the white book. He aimed his flashlight further ahead, then he spun around to check behind him. The passage was surrounded on both sides by solid rock. Everything was dark just outside of the flashlight beam, and there was no sign of anyone else. He turned back to the book, but before the light reached it again, he thought he saw a faint glow. Out of curiosity, he turned his flashlight off for a moment; the book continued to glow with a white aura in the dark.
  
 
  
"Huh," he switched the light on again and stepped forward to collect the book from the ground. The title read: 'Spell Book' in red letters. He turned the book over to study it and he was surprised by how clean it was. He had no idea how long the book had been there, but he knew it looked brand new. The cover was pristine; but, it had to have been there for millennia. He was in the last unexplored ruin on Earth.
  
 
  
Grant often felt like he was the only one still interested in exploring Earth. Drones mapped every corner of Earth and made the data publicly available; but, that was only a test run. The company responsible, Sharp Development, deliberately left cameras off the drones. They only included general topographical information to encourage human exploration. But, most people were more eager to explore Mars as soon as it was mapped. Grant chose to stay behind and see everything he could on Earth instead. He wasn't the only one that stayed behind, but no one else was exploring like he was.
  
 
  
After inspecting the outside he grew curious of the contents and opened the book. The first page was transparent and blank; but, the second page had a header.
  
 
  
"Paladin Spells?" Grant read the title and scanned the list beneath it. He saw the names of spells in black followed by a brief, color-coded description. He didn't know what the colors meant; but, it was easy to see there was a pattern to them.
  
 
  
"\[Auric Blessing\]" Grant read the first spell on the list, then its effect. "Target gains an additional Aura Slot for 1 Lap." the word 'Target' was written in bright red text and he spotted it in red throughout all the other descriptions. 'Aura Slot' and the number '1' were also colored differently. Aura Slot in Gold, and the number in orange. "But how do I cast it…?" he asked himself the question out loud and flipped through the pages to see if the was an explanation somewhere.
  
 
  
"The Spellbook doesn't teach you how to cast spells," a young voice in the darkness made him jump. He spun around trying to light up the entire passage with his flashlight.
  
 
  
"Who said that??" he asked as the light fell on a teenage girl ahead of him. She was pale with long black hair. She wore a black glass visor over her eyes and black chainmail.
  
 
  
"My name's Abby," she said. She nodded at Grant and pointed at the book. "That's my book." Grant closed the book, but he did not hand it to her. He had several questions he wanted to ask at once. How did she get there silently? Where did she come from? But a different one made it out of his mouth first.
  
 
  
"What kind of spell book doesn't teach spells?" he asked. Abby shrugged.
  
 
  
"It's storage," she said. "It keeps track of the spells I've learned but don't have equipped."
  
 
  
"Huh?" he had trouble grasping that concept. "How does that work?"
  
 
  
“Look at that spell again,” Abby replied. She made an upward, flicking motion with her wrist; then, she put her hands in the empty air in front of her and began touching and tapping at something invisible. Grant watched her for a moment before he focused on the spell again. He watched the Auric Blessing spell disappear from the list and everything seemed to move up.
  
 
  
“Where’d it go?” he asked.
  
 
  
“I equipped it,” Abby replied. “I have a limited amount of slots and the book holds the rest so I can swap them as needed. So... can I have it back?" she asked. She'd already proven it was hers and Grant was ready to return the spell book. But, as he handed it over,  the rest of his questions came to mind.
  
 
  
"Where'd you come from?" he asked. "How did the book get here? How long has it been here?"
  
 
  
"About five minutes?" she shrugged as she took the book. Grant watched it disintegrate into white powder once she had it in her hand.
  
 
  
"WHAT!?" He blurted the question out in surprise. He didn't actually mean to yell but he was shocked to watch her destroy the book. Luckily, Abby didn't seem to care about his outburst; she kept talking.
  
 
  
"My friend Dara was showing me around and I stopped here to change some spells; I kind of got distracted before I put the book away properly," she said. Then, she made a grabbing motion with her hand as if she was grabbing something out of thin air; the book appeared in her hand again.
  
 
  
"But.. this is an unexplored ruin? According to Sharp Development, I'm the first one here..." he said.
  
 
  
"Yeah," she giggled. "Sharp Development says a lot of things. Hey, what's your favorite number?" she asked.
  
 
  
"What do you mean Sharp Development 'says a lot of things'?" he asked. He ignored the question about his favorite number; it was such an odd tangent that he felt she was trying to change the subject. He wasn't going to let her.
  
 
  
"I mean there's a reason none of those drones have cameras," she shrugged. "Anyway, thanks for the book. See ya," she waved at Grant and she began to sink into a black hole in the floor. Grant had no idea where it came from but it answered how she got there silently.
  
 
  
"Wait, what are you implying about Sharp Development?" he asked. Abby did not wait and continued to descend. But, she did give him an answer as her head disappeared.
  
 
  
"Do you know anyone that's actually been to Mars?" she asked. The black hole closed leaving Grant alone again. He switched the flashlight off and stood in the quiet darkness with his thoughts as he considered her words. Then, he shook his head in disbelief.
  
 
  
"No, I don't."
