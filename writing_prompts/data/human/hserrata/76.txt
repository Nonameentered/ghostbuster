\[Keys to Villainy\]

Luke sat on the park bench and waited for the alarm. It was a bright, cool Saturday morning but he was too focused on the bank across the street to notice. He was there as a civilian this time and, he had no plans to change into his Super self no matter what happened. His sense of reality was on the line.
  
 
  
He'd taken down plenty of villains over the years, but there was always one that stood out to him. The Robber was odd. He was much more active than any other villain; but, he seemed to have a singular goal: to rob the bank. The Robber attacked the same bank every time, sometimes multiple times a day. Even when Luke did his job and captured The Robber, he did not stay caught for very long; but, that wasn't the strangest thing about The Robber.
  
 
  
Luke tensed when the familiar, shrill alarm filled the air. He had to fight his instincts to do the heroic thing and intervene. He gripped the metal bench hard enough to bend it as he stared across the street. The Robber emerged holding a burlap sack of money. Luke recognized him immediately, despite his new appearance. This time, he looked like a pale teenage boy with coppery-red hair.
  
 
  
The Robber's appearance was different for each encounter, but somehow, he was easy for Luke to spot. Even in the cases when The Robber was a woman. He instinctively knew who he was supposed to capture, and he was fighting against those instincts now. He needed to know more.
  
 
  
During one particular encounter, The Robber went on at length about how Luke's Super self was only a character in a game. At that time, The Robber looked like a tall, muscular orc with green skin; but, he threw a tantrum like a spoiled child as Luke took him to the Super prison. Minutes after turning him over to the authorities, The Robber struck again, at the very same bank. Luke noticed that his personality was completely different that next time, along with the different appearance. Those two experiences back to back left Luke wondering for several days, and across several Robbers. Finally, he decided to try something different. He sat and stared to see if any other heroes showed up.
  
 
  
"HEY!" The latest Robber yelled at Luke and dashed across the street straight to him. He wasn't wearing his uniform or even his mask. He tried to keep a calm face as he looked up at The Robber.
  
 
  
"Don't hurt me!" Luke hoped he could play dumb. But, The Robber's eyes narrowed; he suddenly looked very annoyed.
  
 
  
"I'm robbing the bank," The Robber said. "Aren't you going to try and stop me?" Luke shook his head.
  
 
  
"Why me? Leave me alone!" He turned away and held his hands up in mock fear.
  
 
  
"What?" The Robber dropped the bag of money and stared down at Luke. "What's your favorite number?" he asked. 
  
 
  
"One!" Luke answered from behind his hands. He didn't know why he answered that question and he quickly returned to staring at the floor as he wondered about it.
  
 
  
"Damnit!" The Robber growled. "Forget it, I'll try on a different server," he said.
  
 
  
"What?" Luke looked up again; but, The Robber was gone along with the money. Luke stood and looked around the park; but, The Robber was nowhere in sight. Then, the alarm filled the air again. Luke glanced across at the bank in time to see The Robber exit again. This time, she was a teenage girl with dark hair and a black visor over her eyes. She stopped outside the bank holding the bag of money and looked around.
  
 
  
"Hey!" she walked across the street to Luke, then looked up at him. "Aren't you going to try and stop me?" she asked. Luke did not know how to make sense of the situation. But, if something worked once, he was willing to try it again. He looked down at the girl. He expected to see her eyes through the visor as if they were sunglasses; but, he could not see anything through the black glass and he wondered how she did.
  
 
  
"My favorite number is one," he said.
  
 
  
"Awwww, nuts," the teen sighed and dropped the bag of money. He got a reaction.
  
 
  
"What does that mean?" he asked. The girl glanced around the park, then looked up at him again.
  
 
  
"You don't know?" she asked. "You haven't met Mundo yet?" a grin tugged at the corners of her lips. Luke shook his head.
  
 
  
"Well, it means two things," she said. "First, you're Awake, congratulations," she said.
  
 
  
"Awake..?" Luke asked. She nodded.
  
 
  
"This world is what's known as a Server. It's filled with NPCs so people like me can play in. You're supposed to be the hero that stops us in this particular quest. But, every now and then, a Unique Soul finds its way into NPCs and they become aware of things. We call that being 'Awakened'."
  
 
  
"So... this world really is a game..?" he asked. She nodded. "There are other alternate Earths but not all of them are Servers." Luke's mind began to fill with questions. What was a Unique Soul? Could he see other Earths? But, before he asked for answers on those, he wondered what else she wanted to tell him.
  
 
  
"What's the second thing...?" he asked.
  
 
  
"Unique Souls have a few different traits," she said. "One of the most important ones is that...," Her smile grew broader as she answered and she reached up to lift her visor. Luke had no idea he could be so terrified until he looked into her eyes. They weren't there. Instead, she had two large, living spiders inside her hollowed-out eye sockets. He knew they were alive because they crawled out, then jumped on his face. He screamed as he fell onto the floor because it was covered with hundreds of spiders. He was too busy panicking to hear what she said.
  
 
  
"...we get stronger by killing other Unique Souls."
