\[Deer Helper\] 

"Now, where to start?" Ciani wondered to herself as she looked over the mostly empty lobby. There were only four other patients waiting aside from her; each one sat in a different corner. Three of them looked perfectly content to wait forever for their turn; but, the teenage girl in one corner looked far more nervous to be there. "Oh dear, I suppose I should start with you...," Ciani decided to herself and made her way to the blonde teenager. Her hair was golden-blonde and pulled back into a double-plaited braid that ended just past her shoulders. Rainbow streaks of color were also woven into the end of the braid.
  
 
  
"Hello," Ciani smiled at the teen as she sat down. The girl looked surprised to have anyone sit next to her; she pulled back in her chair. It was almost like she wanted to run away, but couldn't solve how to stand up from the chair. "Are you okay, dear?" Ciani asked. The teen looked over the empty lobby again, then back to the old woman next to her. She made up her mind, then leaned closer.
  
 
  
"I don't know how I got here...," she said. "...I can't remember where I was before this...," Ciani nodded and gave her a reassuring smile.
  
 
  
"I thought that might be the case," she said. "You looked more nervous than the other ones," she gestured at the strangers sitting quietly in each of the other corners. "What's your favorite number?" she asked.
  
 
  
"45!" the teen answered. She was confused at her own answer; but, she had more pressing concerns on her mind. "Can you help me?" she asked.
  
 
  
"I already am," Ciani answered with a grin. Then, she offered her hand to the teen. "By the way, my name's Ciani. What's yours?" she asked.
  
 
  
"Crystal," the teen shook hands with Ciani. "What do you mean you're already helping?"
  
 
  
"I'm too busy to help you myself, but I sent the message out," Ciani held her hand up to show her wrist to Crystal. She saw blue text glowing on her skin.
  
 
  
\[On the way. -Molly\] she was able to read the short message before the words faded.
  
 
  
"How did you do that?" Crystal asked.
  
 
  
"It's called Whispering," Ciani replied. "Once you make your AlterNet character you'll be able to do it too."
  
 
  
"Once I make a character??" Crystal asked. She leaned closer and dropped her voice to a whisper; she didn't want anyone else to hear her. "I can't remember my past!" she said.
  
 
  
"There's a reason for that," a new voice spoke up nearby. Crystal turned and saw another teenager that looked about her age. She had blonde curly hair and wore a white robe. "Mundo will explain all that to you," she added as she smiled at Crystal. "Hi, I'm Molly."
  
 
  
"Who's Mundo?" Crystal turned to Ciani to ask the question. She didn't plan on meeting more people when she opened up to the old woman.
  
 
  
"Mundo is someone who'll answer all your questions," Ciani replied. But, as she gave her answer, she flicked her wrist upward. A large, flat, translucent pane of grey glass appeared in front of her and she began touching and tapping at its surface. "Now that you're Awake, you'll have quite a few, I'm sure. Molly will take you to Mundo." Crystal only half-listened while she tried to determine what exactly Ciani was doing. She watched the woman make a final tap, then she dismissed the floating slate with a wave of her hand.
  
 
  
"I have questions now," Crystal shook her head. "I'm not sure I trust you enough to go anywhere until I get some answers," she added. It was a lie. She hadn't known Molly for longer than three minutes; and, she already trusted her completely for some reason. But, they didn't have to know that.
  
 
  
"Okay," Ciani nodded at her. "I'm no Mundo, but I can try. What do you want to know?" Crystal had a dozen questions; and, she trusted Ciani and Molly enough to let some of them remain unanswered; but, she was determined to get an answer. Even if it was just one, she wanted to handle the interaction her way.
  
 
  
"You said, 'now that I'm awake'," Crystal answered. It was the first thing she focused on. "What does that mean?"
  
 
  
"The world is full of people that aren't really paying attention," Ciani said. She turned and gestured at the old man sitting quietly in a corner waiting his turn. "We call them NPCs; they're doing the only thing they know how to do without noticing what they're doing. But, every once in a while, a Unique Soul realizes it wants to do something else; more specifically, it realizes it can do something else," Ciani smiled at Crystal. "You probably got bored waiting here all the time," she said.
  
 
  
"Wait...," Crystal's blue eyes narrowed as she processed the information. "...I'm an NPC??" She didn't quite understand what that was yet; but, she knew it didn't sound like a good thing. It sounded like a passive, uneventful existence that she wanted no part of; she was alive and wanted to see more than the inside of the hospital.
  
 
  
"You were," Ciani nodded at something directly behind Crystal. She turned and looked out of curiosity. She was surprised to find another teenage girl sitting quietly nearby. "But, now that you're Awake, you've been replaced." Then, she turned and nodded at Molly. "you got it from here?" she asked. Molly nodded.
  
 
  
"Good luck, I'll see you around," Ciani waved at Crystal and walked to the other teenager nearby.
  
 
  
"What's she doing?" Crystal asked as a tall black portal opened next to Molly.
  
 
  
"She's doing the quest you were supposed to help with," Molly explained. She gestured at the portal to encourage Crystal to step into it. But, Crystal was too curious. She watched Ciani chat with the teenager for a moment. Then, the new teen jumped to her feet and screamed for help.
  
 
  
"DOCTOR!!!!!" she yelled. Crystal was eager to go and help to make sure that Ciani was okay; but, Molly didn't seem concerned.
  
 
  
"Is she going to be okay?" Crystal asked. Molly nodded.
  
 
  
"Sure, Ciani's a pro," she giggled. Loud, rushing steps pulled Crystal's attention and she saw a bulky, sickly-pale doctor charging through the halls towards Ciani. "And, the quest is pretty easy, there's a trick to it." The grotesque doctor stood in front of Ciani and growled at her; but, he made no other move.
  
 
  
"He's not doing anything?" Crystal asked. Molly nodded with a grin.
  
 
  
"That's the trick," she giggled. "It's a Healer quest; if Ciani doesn't attack, he won't either."
