"Uhhh...," Vivi stared at the witch for a moment with a blank look on her face. "I want it to...taste good?" she asked. This was Vivi's first time in a restaurant without someone to order for her; and, only her fifth visit to any restaurant at all. She was born and raised in a communal bomb shelter. When the door was finally opened, they found a utopian society above ground. Within days she was enrolled in a new school and once she got the hang of that she was brave enough to venture out on her own. This new restaurant was only her first stop.
  
 
  
"I only make great-tasting potions," the witch replied. "What buff do you want?"
  
 
  
"..what buffs do you offer?" Vivi asked. She didn't know what a buff was; but, she hoped that a list would help clarify it for her. The witch stared down at her over her crooked green nose.
  
 
  
"All of them," she replied. "Look kid, these are sensitive ingredients. They're spoiling away as we speak; there's a reason this service is offered tableside. Even if you don't order anything, you're already paying for wasted product."
  
 
  
"Hi, I'm Emily," a silver-haired teen girl walked up and introduced herself to Vivi. "Do you mind if I join you for the Witch's Brew?" she asked.
  
 
  
"Please!" Vivi nodded eagerly. She was always glad to make more friends and she hoped Emily would know what to order.
  
 
  
"What Class do you play?" Emily asked as she sat on the other side of the table.
  
 
  
"Class?" Vivi took an extra moment to register the question. She was still new to everything, including the AlterNet, and she hadn't fully associated that word yet. "Oh, I'm a Craftsman," she said. "Tailor." Emily nodded, then she looked up at the witch.
  
 
  
"I'll have the Sparkling Sunrise, and Void Coffee for my friend here," she said.
  
 
  
"Comin' Up!" The witch cackled lightly and began grabbing ingredients from her belt to throw into the pot.
  
 
  
"Sparkling Sunrise gives me a buff that makes my heals stronger," Emily explained once Vivi focused on her again. "Void Coffee will reduce your crafting time for a couple of hours. I can send you a full list if you want, that way you know for next time."
  
 
  
"Yes, Please!" Vivi nodded. Her attention was divided between the show of colorful smoke and liquids happening next to them and her new friend. "So you're a Healer?" she asked.
  
 
  
"Sparkling Sunrise," the witch spoke up and placed a wide, stout glass on the table. It was the most amazing drink Vivi had ever seen at that point. Black liquid sat at the bottom of the glass, but the color changed towards the top. The gradient went from black to a thin layer of red, then a thicker layer of orange gave way a sea-blue color at the top. A streak of carbonated, sparkling golden-yellow liquid ran along the center like the reflection of a sun. She was in awe that all the colors were so vivid and somehow stayed separate. She couldn't wait to see what her drink looked like. She glanced back at the witch but was disappointed that all the puffs of colored smoke were gone. The witch continued to throw ingredients into the cauldron but it only produced black smoke each time. Then, Emily distracted her by answering her question.
  
 
  
"I'm a Card Mage," Emily said. "I can heal as well as a Healer," she added. "Most people come get a buff when they already know what they're going to do with it; but, you didn't know that...," she said. "Do you have any plans after this?"
  
 
  
"I thought I was getting lunch," Vivi shook her head.
  
 
  
"Great! Are you on a derby team yet?" Emily asked. Vivi shook her head again.
  
 
  
"Great! You're coming with me after this, we need more members," she grinned.
  
 
  
"Void Coffee," the witch spoke and set a white mug down in front of Vivi. "Remember: Buffs last for 2 hours. Thank you for your patronage." She gave a polite nod, then turned and walked away.
  
 
  
"Ready to buff up?" Emily asked. She grabbed her glass from the bottom and lifted it. But, Vivi was still peering into her mug. She turned and twisted the mug and her own neck to try and catch the light.
  
 
  
"There's nothing in here..., she said. Emily giggled and looked at the end of the table. She studied the salt and pepper shakers for a moment, then she reached under the table. When she brought her hand up again she held a glass sugar shaker. She reached across the table.
  
 
  
"Yes there is, it's just hard to see. It doesn't reflect light; but, watch the sugar." Emily shook the jar and a stream of white crystals poured out. They fell through the air and disappeared the moment they touched the liquid shadow in the cup.
  
 
  
"Ohhhh, wow!" Vivi was suitably impressed. Her drink wasn't as colorful as Emily's but that was okay. It was obvious her cup was full of magic too; and, now she had at least one new friend. "I'm ready," she nodded and lifted her own mug to toast. But, Emily pulled back before they touched glasses.
  
 
  
"Wait, I don't know your name yet," she said.
  
 
  
"Violet Victoria," she sat up straighter when she introduced herself. "But, my friends call me Vivi."
