\[Thirsty for Life\] 

"I can't believe it...," Adam looked around the bustling town. Plenty of armed guards and robed pedestrians wandered through the narrow streets. He was ecstatic to have found civilization. He had no idea how much time he spent lost in the desert; but, it felt like an eternity. "...it almost doesn't seem real," he chuckled at the guard.
  
 
  
"Congrats on getting past the mirage! Come on in," the guard repeated his greeting again.
  
 
  
"Thank you, really, thank you," Adam nodded. "Please, I'm so thirsty, where might I find water?" he asked. He did not want to complain too much. He was thankful to find the town at all. But, his predicament was pretty apparent. He wore strips torn from his shirt on his head and neck to protect him from the sun. The rest of his clothes were filthy with sand and grime and his skin was tan and leathery. He felt like he might die if he did not get a drink within the next few minutes.
  
 
  
"Congrats on getting past the mirage! Come on in," the guard repeated.
  
 
  
"Alright, ass, I don't know what your game is, but I'll try someone else..," Adam sighed and left the guard. He couldn't afford to waste energy being angry. He was on the verge of dehydration. He spotted another nearby guard and made his way to him.
  
 
  
"Excuse me, sir," Adam approached the guard.
  
 
  
"Hello, welcome to the Mirage City of Duneport," he replied.
  
 
  
"Thank you. Could you direct me to the inn, please? I'm so thirsty," Adam said.
  
 
  
"Hello, the guard smiled. "Welcome to the Mirage City of Duneport," he repeated.
  
 
  
"Thanks for nothing," Adam sighed. "Well, it shouldn't be hard to find...," Adam decided to search for it himself. Although, now he had a new worry. Even if he did find the inn, he wasn't sure they would pay any attention to him. But, he would do whatever he needed to, to survive.
  
 
  
"There you are!" Adam took two steps before a young voice distracted him. He turned to see a blonde teenage girl wearing a white robe. "What are you doing in town?" she asked.
  
 
  
"I'm sorry, do I know you?" Adam asked.
  
 
  
"What?" She tilted her head at him in confusion. Adam thought he saw her eyes flash gold for a moment; then, she giggled and shook her head. "Ohhhhh," she sighed.
  
 
  
"Hi, I'm Molly," the teen introduced herself with an extended hand. Adam shook it.
  
 
  
"Adam," he said. "Molly, do you know where I can get some water?" he asked.
  
 
  
"Oh! Maybe," she said. She pulled out a white leather canteen from under her robe and offered it to him. "Here, try this," she said.
  
 
  
"Thank you!" Adam grabbed the canteen, popped it open, then tilted his head back to pour water in his mouth. A clear liquid poured out of the container but it did not feel like water. Whatever it was, it felt dry, almost like he had a mouthful of clear sand. He spit out whatever landed in his mouth and threw the canteen down.
  
 
  
"What the hell is that??" he asked.
  
 
  
"Sorry," Molly shrugged. "I wasn't sure if that would work. Here, this is real water," she handed him a clear plastic bottle full of water. Adam sipped it just to make sure, then he tilted his head back to glug mouthfuls of it once he confirmed what it was. Molly picked up the white canteen from the floor while Adam finished the bottle of water. She slipped it back under her robe.
  
 
  
"Thank you," Adam sighed as he held on to the now-empty bottle. "But.. what was that other stuff?" he asked.
  
 
  
"Water," she shrugged. "But, it's not real water. It's a quest item that I'm supposed to give to an NPC," she said.
  
 
  
"So... you're on a quest?" Adam asked. He didn't know what an NPC was, but he knew what a quest was. Maybe if he stuck with her he could get on his feet.
  
 
  
"Yep," she nodded.
  
 
  
"Need any help?" he asked.
  
 
  
"Sure," Molly nodded with a smile. She didn't actually need any help; but, she knew that he did. "We can go in a few minutes after the new NPC spawns; after that, I'll take you to meet Mundo," she added.
  
 
  
"Who's Mundo?" Adam asked. He was glad to meet more people, he could use more friends. Standing there with Molly, he couldn't remember having any friends. Logically, he knew he should have had some at some point; but, it seemed like all he could remember was the desert.
  
 
  
"Mundo is someone that'll explain things to you and help you figure out what you want to do," she said. Adam couldn't believe his luck. That sounded like exactly the kind of person he needed to meet.
  
 
  
"Thank you so much," he told Molly. "I'd really, really appreciate that," he said.
  
 
  
"I figured," Molly grinned, then she started walking towards the city gates. "C'mon, the NPC should be out there already," she said. Adam realized they were leaving the town. And, thinking back on what Molly said about her quest, he couldn't help but chuckle a little bit.
  
 
  
"What's on your mind?" Molly asked him as they walked.
  
 
  
"Nothing," Adam grinned. "You said your quest is giving water to someone lost in the desert; I just think it's a funny coincidence that I was lost in the desert too," he chuckled. But, Molly shook her head as they walked across the sand.
  
 
  
"It's not a coincidence," she replied. "Sometimes NPCs Wake up." She turned to look him in the eyes to make sure the message was clear. "Congratulations," she said.
