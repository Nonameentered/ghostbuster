\[Questions. Again.\]

"This is getting ridiculous," Grant mumbled to himself as he took his seat again. It was the third time that night, not including when he first arrived. He was starving and the banquet that was laid out for the guests looked even more appetizing after each interruption. Full-roasted turkeys and chickens were set out on his table along with all imaginable appropriate sides. He decided he wasn't going to wait for the host to give his speech and reached across the table for the nearest chicken leg.
  
 
  
But, as he leaned forward, he felt something heavy bump his thigh. It felt heavier than his phone; and, that was in his other pocket anyway. On any other night, he would have disregarded the sensation in favor of getting something in his stomach. But, after the constant interruptions of the evening, something told him not to ignore it.
  
 
  
Grant pulled back without grabbing the leg and sat up straight in his chair. He glanced around but all the other dignitaries were occupied with their own mindless chatter. Even if he tried listening in on a conversation, there were so many people talking he only heard vague crowd noise. He slowly reached into his pocket and his eyes widened as soon as he felt the cold, solid weight. He gently touched around the edges to confirm his suspicion; it was a gun.
  
 
  
He knew he had to get rid of it as soon as possible. He stood as soon as it registered; but, he did not move fast enough.
  
 
  
"Ladies and Gentlemen, may I please have everyone's attention?!"
  
 
  
"That figures...," Grant sighed; but, he stepped away from his seat as everyone turned to face the detective. He hoped tried to rush without running; but, the door was too far from his seat. After only a few steps, the detective spoke up again.
  
 
  
"My name is Detective Rerun. I'm asking that everyone remain where you are." Grant turned to face the detective. The words had been the same every time, except for the name; but, this was a new face again. The fourth detective he'd seen that night. He was a young kid, again, this time a stringy teenage boy with light brown hair in a black suit.
  
 
  
Grant was the only attendee standing at the moment and the Detective approached him first. The rest of the guests remained quiet and in place. 
  
 
  
"Please go back to your seat, Sir," Detective Rerun said. "I'll be questioning everyone, one at a time."
  
 
  
"Why not start with me?" Grant asked. The question was born of frustration and hunger. He'd already been through too many questionings that night. He wasn't going to volunteer that he had a gun in his pocket, and if Detective Rerun asked the same questions as the others, he wouldn't have to. Thinking back on it, they hadn't even searched him. Each Detective before simply questioned a few people, then produced a gun claiming they found an assassin. 
  
 
  
He wasn't initially surprised there was a second assassin found. It was a VIP event with important ambassadors from dozens of nations. Grant felt lucky to be there, though, he couldn't remember when the invitation came. He couldn't remember looking forward to it, he just remembered being interrupted before he ate. 
  
 
  
"What?" Detective Rerun tilted his head as he looked up at the older man. 
  
 
  
"What what?" Grant asked. He stopped trying to think his way out of the situation. None of it made sense. He decided to say the first thing that came to mind. "I'm already standing up. If you're going to talk to everyone, why not start with me?" Detective Rerun looked at the table and Grant's empty seat. 
  
 
  
"You're not in the right area," Detective Rerun shrugged. "Just go to your seat, please." He started to walk away, but Grant interrupted. 
  
 
  
"Wait," he said. The teen Detective stopped and turned. "If you're not going to talk to me, then can I leave?" 
  
 
  
"I'll be talking to everyone, please sit," he replied. 
  
 
  
"No you won't," Grant replied. He surprised himself by not moving. He knew none of the other Detectives did. And, Detective Rerun's comment about being in the wrong area helped solidify that fact in Grant's mind. 
  
 
  
"What do you mean?" the teen asked. 
  
 
  
"None of the others did." 
  
 
  
"Others?" Rerun asked. He sighed with minor annoyance in his voice. "What's your favorite number?" he asked. 
  
 
  
"55!" Grant replied. His instant answers no longer surprised him. 
  
 
  
"Awww, fudge," Rerun whined. He flicked his wrist upward at waist height and a square pane of grey glass appeared in front of him. He began typing on its surface. "At least I didn't start questioning anyone yet," he added.
  
 
  
"What are you doing?" Grant asked. Rerun ignored him and kept his focus on the glassy slate. Grant's frustration reached its limit. He was starving, and confused. Then, he remembered he was also armed. Whatever was happening, jail couldn't be much worse than he felt at that moment. He reached into his pocket and drew the gun on Rerun. That drew the teen's attention, but only for a moment. 
  
 
  
"You were the assassin?" he asked with a laugh. He glanced at the long table full of quiet guests and chuckled some more. "It's a good thing you Woke up, I would've gotten bored of questioning before getting to you." He typed a bit longer, then dismissed it with a wave. 
  
 
  
The glass pane dissolved into white powder and disappeared. Grant was too distracted to notice. The gun in his hand disintegrated at the same time. 
  
 
  
"What's happening?" Grant asked. "What do you mean I Woke up?" 
  
 
  
"I'm not good at explaining it, I'm still kind of new to the AlterNet myself," Rerun replied. "But, if you let me finish this quest first, I'll take you to someone who will answer all your questions." 
  
 
  
"Quest?" Grant asked. "Like in a game?" 
  
 
  
"A lot like that," Rerun nodded at Grant's empty seat. Except when he looked, it was no longer empty. Another man sat there and Grant also noticed the unintelligible chatter had started again. 
  
 
  
"Ladies and Gentlemen, may I please have everyone's attention?!" a new voice quieted the guests. "My name is Detective Kim." It was a teen girl this time. "I'm asking that everyone remain where you are." 
  
 
  
"Fudge…," Rerun sighed. Then he looked up at Grant. "...someone else started it. I'll take you to Mundo now, then come try again."
