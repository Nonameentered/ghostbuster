\[Cow: Noble\]

"Well, congratulations...," Vivi nodded at the young blonde woman in overalls and a straw hat. They all stood in a barn around a white and black spotted cow. "...she's 100% a normal cow, right Pyxis?" Vivi turned to her friend. Golden stars faded from Pxyis' eyes as she nodded.
  
 
  
"Yep! Bessie's all normal," she said as she patted the cow's back.
  
 
  
"Whew, that's a relief," the blonde, Barley, said. "It don't hurt nothing to make extra sure, you know? I appreciate you coming out to check on her for me," she said. Both girls grinned and shook their heads.
  
 
  
"It's good field experience," Vivi said. "I'm glad Doc Mundo sent me."
  
 
  
"I'm just happy to meet you!" Pyxis grinned. She already greeted Barley with a handshake that lasted too long when they arrived; but, she was still fighting the impulse to do it again.
  
 
  
"Wait a minute...," Vivi looked at Barley up and down. She was a short, plump woman with lush blonde curls. A second look around the barn highlighted the wall lined with numerous golden and silver oil lamps. She didn't pay much attention to it the first time. Then she glanced at Pyxis who stared at the woman; she was obviously starstruck. Vivi was working at Doc Mundo's clinic when he asked her to make a simple housecall for him. He didn't give her too much info; but, she knew he wouldn't give her anything she couldn't handle. Vivi asked her team for company and Pyxis was the only one available. She sounded like she was still on the fence until Vivi mentioned they were going to Barley's farm. It wasn't until just then that she realized why Pyxis changed her mind. "... you're BARLEY!??" she asked.
  
 
  
"I am," Barley nodded with a broad smile. "And this here is my noble steed, Bessie," she giggled and gestured at the cow that Vivi examined. Doc Mundo ran a clinic for fae and other magical creatures. For some reason, Barley wanted to be sure Bessie wasn't one. Vivi felt the thrill of meeting someone famous course through her; Barley was one of the most well-known and well-liked players in the AlterNet. Aurora, the team leader, often went on and on about how wise Barley was. She would tell them if they ever needed advice, Barley was the one to ask. Even Doc Mundo had nothing but kind things to say about her.
  
 
  
"So...," Vivi wracked her mind for something to ask. In a way, she wanted to 'test out' Barley's wisdom. But, more than that, she felt like it would be a wasted opportunity if she left without asking for advice. Unfortunately, the pressure of being on the spot didn't help things. She dragged it out as much as she could; but, she needed to say something. "...what was suspicious about the cow?" she asked. It wasn't a useful question except for buying her more time to think.
  
 
  
"Nothin' particular, I suppose," Barley shrugged. "I was in the mood to try some adventurin' and I wanted to make sure Bessie wasn't going to take it personally if'n I rode on her back."
  
 
  
"Sure, okay..," Vivi nodded. This was the paragon of wisdom that everyone talked about? "..but, why did you choose a cow?"
  
 
  
"Oh, I didn't," Barley shook her head. "T'was chosen for me," she nodded at the wall full of hanging lamps.
  
 
  
"OOOH!" Vivi was kind of surprised. "You... wished for it?" she asked.   Even though she saw the dozen or so lamps hanging on the wall, she hadn't quite registered they were genie lamps until Barley pointed it out. Barley had a reputation for finding genies often. From some people's perspective, she had a reputation for wasting wishes frivolously as well.
  
 
  
"Kind of...," Barley nodded. All the positive gossip she'd heard about Barley was fading fast. Why would anyone waste a wish on a single mount at all? And, a cow a that! Wishing for money could have bought her the best horse and adventuring gear and more. Vivi wasn't usually a judgemental person; she loved helping people and it was why she wanted to learn with Doc Mundo. But, at the moment, she was struggling with her own preconceived notions about Barley. "If'n you want some advice, you should always be careful what you say to people; especially genies," she giggled.
  
 
  
"Yeah," Vivi nodded. "Most people know that," she said. It was hard not to sound disenchanted; but, no one noticed. Barley seemed generally oblivious about things and somehow Pyxis was still starstruck.
  
 
  
"I've had plenty of run-ins with genies and even I forget sometimes," Barley grinned and nodded.
  
 
  
"How did you end up with a cow?" Vivi asked. She was curious about the wording that Barley used; she wanted to believe the woman wouldn't just wish for a cow to start with. Though, her answer only disappointed Vivi further.
  
 
  
"Heck if I know?" Barley shrugged. "I'm still tryin' to figure out what the genie misunderstood. I thought my wish was pretty simple," she said.
  
 
  
"Okay," Vivi nodded. At least she had an opening now. "What exactly was your wish?"
  
 
  
"Oh, here, listen," Barley reached into the front pocket of her overalls and pulled out her clear node. "I started recording my wishes for when they go wrong," she said. She navigated the interface like a smartphone, then she held up the card to Vivi. The screen showed Barley on screen in front of a blue, half-man with a smoky bottom half.
  
 
  
"Okay, I want to start adventurin'. So here's my first wish. I wish to have a neat mount to get around on. Something friendly that won't mind me riding it. And the most important thing is...," The Barley on-screen stressed the last part of her request. "...it's very important that it's noble!"
