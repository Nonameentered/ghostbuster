Alis strolled through the sea of purple auras with a smile on her face. It was a bright, cool Saturday morning; Fall had arrived. She could not stand the thought of spending such a beautiful morning stuck at home, so she made her way downtown. It was as crowded as she hoped with dozens of shoppers wandering in and out of each store with colorful packages.
  
 
  
Days like today were the only chance she got to experience what she thought a big city might be like. Throughout most of the week, her small downtown plaza was quiet and she was stuck in school wishing she could be somewhere else. Alis always felt like there was more to the world, the universe even, than anyone in her town could imagine. Though, she did often wonder if she only felt like that because she knew that she was special. She was the only person she'd ever met that could see people's auras.
  
 
  
Alis was only 14 but she felt like she'd had the ability to see the colors around people all her life. Over the years she developed an understanding of what they meant. Bright colors revealed people's feelings towards her. Most of the time the colors around her parents was gold which meant love, though they had the occasional flash of other colors. Sometimes they turned blue when talking about money; she knew whatever color she saw was only ever in the moment. Once, when she was sick, both her parents were yellow with fear for several days.
  
 
  
It took a little bit of extra attention to differentiate the yellow from the gold auras, but she had a lot of time in bed with nothing else to distract her. Whenever someone felt emotion towards Alis, she could tell by the color. But, every other stranger that wouldn't have a feeling towards her one way or the other glowed with soft purple light. She considered it the baseline and she was happiest when surrounded by purple glows. She loved being lost in the lights confident in the fact that no one knew her. She longed for the big city; but, she knew that she would end up there one way or the other. The insight her ability gave her taught her to live in the moment. Everything changes, especially feelings.
  
 
  
Alis stopped at an intersection to wait for the light to change. While she stood in a crowd of purple glows, a flash of black caught the corner of her eye.
  
 
  
"What?" Alis was so surprised that she spoke it aloud. She turned to her right and saw what looked like the tail end of a black cloak. A person walked out of sight between two buildings. But, instead of the purple glow that everyone else had, they were covered with a flowing cloak. It was pitch black and Alis was sure it wasn't a real cloak. It was the stranger's aura.
  
 
  
The decision was quick and easy. She had never seen a color other than purple that wasn't related to her in some way. Even if this instance had nothing to do with her, she needed to find that out too. She left the purple strangers and followed the new one. Alis turned around the building into the alley and she froze.
  
 
  
She did not have a plan going in, and the stranger simply stood against the wall as if waiting for something. It was another teen girl about Alis' age. She had black hair that was shorter than Alis' own shoulder-length chestnut curls. She was also surrounded by a black hooded cloak that floated around her. A golden-bladed scythe and an hourglass of golden sand also hovered in front of her with no sign of the purple aura that everyone else had. Even when she could see others' feelings towards her, the purple was always visible underneath.
  
 
  
"Hi," the teen looked as surprised as Alis to see her there.
  
 
  
"Uhmmm. hi...," Alis tried to ignore the black aura and come up with a reason that she was there. She did not find one. "I'm Alis," she said. "It's short for Borealis."
  
 
  
"I'm Steph," the teen replied with a half-wave. "It's short for Stephanie," she smiled. Alis felt at ease. It was the first time she'd given her full name without surprising someone. It was usually met with some form of, 'what kind of name is that?' But, Steph didn't seem to care about her odd name, and that made Alis like her a little bit more.
  
 
  
"So..., are you waiting for something?" Alis asked. She moved closer to Steph to carry on the conversation. It was getting easier to ignore the cloak.
  
 
  
"Oh, wow," Steph's smile grew wider when Alis was close enough. "I didn't realize you were an Estrella," she said with a nod. "I'm waiting for a friend, you should meet her too."  Alis accepted the explanation, but she still tilted her head.
  
 
  
"I'm a... what?" she asked. Steph reflected the same confused look.
  
 
  
"You don't know?" she asked. "But you're using your Sight right now, your eyes are full of stars," she said. As she answered Alis' question, Steph pulled out a transparent piece of glass. She tapped the surface and held it up. By the time Alis looked into to it, it was a mirror that perfectly reflected the golden stars in her eyes.
  
 
  
"What's wrong with my eyes!?" She asked. The golden glow disappeared when she panicked, and the black cloak around Steph also disappeared. "What??" Alis looked back at the opening of the alley. Several pedestrians walked by but none of them were glowing purple.
  
 
  
"Oh, you really need to meet my friend if you didn't know," Steph said. "And, Mundo. You definitely need to meet Mundo."
  
 
  
"What's going on? What am I?" Alis asked. She had some fear in her voice, but it was quickly being replaced by interest. She focused on passing shoppers and willed her eyes to see the purple again. It showed up and she turned back to see Steph covered in the black cloak. After a moment she willed it to turn off and the cloak disappeared.
  
 
  
"You are Unique Soul #35, La Estrella. The star. It means a few different things, but the relevant one is that you can see people's souls. I'm Unique Soul #14, La Muerte. The Death. So, you probably see me covered in a black cloak. But, not now because you turned it off," she giggled.
  
 
  
"You.. you can tell?" Alis asked. She willed her eyes to glow again and Steph nodded.
  
 
  
"You get golden stars in your eyes when you use it," she said.
  
 
  
"I feel like I've been using it all the time...," Alis shook her head. "Why didn't anyone else notice? My friends? My parents? I'm surrounded by people that care for me and no one said anything?"
  
 
  
"Oh, they wouldn't have noticed," Steph said. "NPCs usually ignore that kind of thing."
