"Huh?" Raven was startled by a sudden moment of clarity. She stood in the crowd of suits and waited with a glazed, bored expression like them; but for a brief second, her eyes focused on someone. She felt like she was suddenly paying attention where she never had before. She stared at a young, teenage girl with golden curls. The girl knelt as if to pick something up from the ground. Then, she stood and walked away. Raven stepped away from the group to get a better look; but, the teen stranger was nowhere to be seen. 
  
 
  
"What were you doing...?" Raven mumbled the question to herself as she took a few steps closer to where the teen was. She glanced around to see if anyone noticed her; but, no one did. The group of commuters remained in place with empty expressions. "What am I doing...?" she asked herself as she took another step toward the spot.
  
 
  
She stared at the empty curb with wonder; she had no idea why she found it so interesting. Then, as she watched, tiny white particles began floating upward from the sidewalk. It was only a few at first; then, within moments, a flood of millions, if not billions of white particles surged up from the ground. They coalesced into a single shape and it began to change colors and became transparent. Raven watched the jar of rice come into existence and she had no idea how it happened. It was a two-foot tall glass jar that was mostly filled with dry white rice.
  
 
  
"Did anyone see that??" Raven turned to ask the crowd but none of them acknowledged her. She looked up and down the sidewalk. There were plenty of pedestrians on their way to somewhere, but none of them found the jar of rice as interesting as she did. The few strangers that walked near were sure to walk around the jar without disturbing it.
  
 
  
"Yeah, okay...," Raven shrugged when she made her decision. "...I'll take free sidewalk rice." She was more curious than anything. She walked up to the jar; but, the blonde teenager appeared out of nowhere before Raven knelt.
  
 
  
"Oh, I'm sorry, you were here first," the teen noticed Raven and smiled. "Go ahead, I'll take the next one; it spawns pretty fast," she said. Raven didn't know what the girl was talking about; but, she was never one to let it show when she was out of her depth.
  
 
  
"You're right," Raven nodded. "It does come back quickly," she said. She didn't want to risk using the word 'spawn' incorrectly and hoped she was right about what it meant. "I don't mind waiting; but, I am curious. What are you working on? I saw you come by a little bit ago."
  
 
  
“Thanks!” the teen grinned and knelt to grab the jar of rice. Then, a tall black portal appeared in the air behind her. “Let me go put this down, then I’ll come back and tell you what I’m working on.” The teen turned and walked into the portal. She was gone for almost a minute before she walked out of the hole again. 
  
 
  
"My name's Molly," she offered her hand. 
  
 
  
"Raven," she introduced herself as she shook Molly's hand. 
  
 
  
"I'm not doing a quest or anything," Molly explained. "I'm just stockpiling ingredients." 
  
 
  
"Stockpiling?" that didn't answer any of the questions Raven was too proud to ask. She tried another angle. "Are you a chef?" 
  
 
  
"No, I'm a Healer," Molly replied. "My guild doesn't have a Chef yet. But as soon as we get one they'll have plenty to work with. What class are you?" 
  
 
  
"Class? 2016!" Confusion washed over Molly's face and Raven knew that was the wrong answer. "HAHAHA! I'M KIDDING!" she patted Molly on the shoulder as she forced out the laughter. 
  
 
  
"I.. um… I haven't picked a Class yet," Raven replied. 
  
 
  
"Ah, you're still new to the AlterNet, huh?" 
  
 
  
"Not at all," Raven shook her head. "I've been on the AlterNet for a while. Just taking the time to make the right decision," she added. Molly stared up at the woman with a curious smirk on her lips. 
  
 
  
"If you want more information I can help you learn about the different classes," Molly said. She could tell that Raven was lying, but there was no reason to highlight it.
  
 
  
"No, no. I'm fine. I don't need any help," Raven answered. She was smart enough to figure things out by herself. And a teenage girl had nothing to teach her. Another jar of rice appeared between them. 
  
 
  
“You can go ahead and take that one too,” Raven offered. She knew it wasn’t normal rice and she had no idea what would happen if she tried to cook it. “I don’t need any.” 
  
 
  
“Thank you,” Molly smiled and knelt to grab the jar of rice. “Don’t go anywhere,” Molly paused before she stepped into the portal again. After another few moments she came out of the portal and she offered Raven a transparent glass card.
  
 
  
“I’m sure you have a dozen nodes,” Molly shrugged as she held it out to Raven.  “But, since you helped me, I’ll give you this node in return,” she added. She made sure to wiggle it at Raven each time she used the word ‘node’. Raven didn’t seem to want help; but, Molly wasn’t going to let that stop her. She could see through Raven’s lies and she knew it didn’t come from a place of malice. 
  
 
  
“Oh great, another node…,” Raven sighed dramatically, but she put it in her pocket. The time appeared on the display as soon as she touched it. She realized it was technology far beyond anything she’d seen so far; but, she was supposed to have seen it already. She couldn’t wait to get rid of Molly so she could play with it some more and maybe learn how to use it. “Thanks, I’ll find something to do with it,” Raven said.
  
 
  
“Good luck, and I’ll see you around the AlterNet!” Molly waved at Raven as she stepped into another portal. “Oh, by the way! You probably don’t need a reminder; but I’m already telling you,” Molly giggled. “If you’re not going to do the tutorial you can get rid of it for more space.” 
  
 
  
“Tutorial?” Raven grinned as she nodded. “Yeah, I knew that. But, thank you.”
  
 
  
“No problem, Raven…,” Molly smiled as the portal closed around her. She was on the other side and she had time to speak again before she disappeared. “And, Welcome to the AlterNet!”
