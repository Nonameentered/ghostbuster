\[Sun. Cooked?\]

"No," Lana shook her head. "But, if I could just talk to -," The butler hadn't said another word and simply closed the door on her. She took a moment to sigh, then slung her bag back onto her shoulders. It wasn't the first time she'd been answered with a closed door and she knew it wouldn't be the last. She heard giggles as she turned around and was surprised to see two teenage girls approaching the door. One had shoulder-length curly dark hair and the other had long silver hair that extended further down her back.
  
 
  
"Hi," the curly-haired one said as both girls smiled at her and knocked on the door.
  
 
  
"Hi," Lana nodded politely and began to make her way down the path.
  
 
  
"Do you need a group?" the same girl asked.
  
 
  
"I'm sorry?" Lana turned first to make sure the comment was meant for her. The door opened and the same old, stern butler opened the door.
  
 
  
"Are you here for the job?" he asked. But, none of the girls answered right away. The silver-haired one was focused on the dark-haired one that looked at Lana. The curly-haired teen gestured at the door with her thumb.
  
 
  
"Wanna join us?" she asked.
  
 
  
"I'm not here to apply for any job," Lana shook her head. She lifted her shoulder to indicate the leather satchel. "I'm selling homemade cosmetics."
  
 
  
"What?" The brown-haired girl tilted her head slightly and at the same moment, Lana thought she saw a flash of gold in her eyes.
  
 
  
"Ohhhh, oops," she giggled. "Sorry, I didn't pay close enough attention."
  
 
  
"Are you here for the job?" the butler asked again. His voice still sounded as monotone as the first time Lana heard it. Despite the fact they all seemed to be ignoring him, he showed no signs of frustration. They continued to ignore him and the girl stepped closer to Lana with an outstretched hand.
  
 
  
"My name is Aurora, and this is my friend Emily," she said.
  
 
  
"Lana...," she gave her name and shook Aurora's hand. "Do you girls want to try some of my cosmetics?"
  
 
  
"YES!" Emily blurted out; but, then she glanced back at the butler. "But, after this?" she asked.
  
 
  
"After... what?" Lana asked.
  
 
  
"C'mon, we'll explain on the way," Aurora replied and she pulled Lana forward. Then, she turned and face the butler.
  
 
  
"Yes, we're here for the job," she said.
  
 
  
"But, I'm not..," Lana tried to protest but the butler stepped aside to let them in. Emily went in first followed by Aurora pulling Lana along.
  
 
  
"If you'll follow me," the butler said. He turned and began walking down a large hallway that extended from the foyer. The floor was dark hardwood and several paintings decorated the hall on both sides.
  
 
  
"Emily's kind of new to the AlterNet too, so this'll be fun," Aurora smiled at Lana. "By the way, just so she can see it in action, what's your favorite number?"
  
 
  
"One," Lana answered instinctively even before she registered the question. "What?" She was confused. And, her ego was a little bruised when they both giggled again.
  
 
  
"My favorite number is 46 and Emily's is 21," Aurora said. It didn't help clarify anything for Lana but the butler led them through a pair of swinging doors and into the largest kitchen Lana had ever been in. It was what she imagined a high-class hotel kitchen to be like. She counted at least four stainless steel refrigerators against one wall, several prep tables, ranges, and stoves, including two flat tops.
  
 
  
Lana was the last one through the door. As soon as she stepped in and took a look around, another door from the other side of the kitchen swung open and a maid came through.
  
 
  
"Roast turkey with all the trimmings," she said to no one in particular then walked out again, behind the butler. The two teenagers and Lana were left alone in the kitchen.
  
 
  
"I don't know how to cook..," Lana shook her head. "Why did you bring me along?"
  
 
  
"I got it!" Emily chirped. She dashed to one of the fridges and Aurora turned her attention to Lana.
  
 
  
"You don't have to know how to cook," she smiled. "That's why I brought you in. You didn't know what goes on here, and there's a lot for you to learn."
  
 
  
"What are you talking about? I don't want to learn how to cook, I created my own line of cosmetics that I'm trying to sell," she said. Lana saw Emily put a turkey into the oven; but, she hadn't even bothered to take off the plastic wrapping nor put it on a pan.
  
 
  
"Do you know how to cook?" Lana had to ask.
  
 
  
"Kind of," Aurora nodded. "But, we don't need that here. Do you play any video games or anything?" she asked.
  
 
  
"No time...," Lana shook her head. She had to work two jobs just to keep herself afloat. She chose to devote all her free time to her dream of breaking into the makeup industry. It was a rare day that she had off from both jobs and she planned to spend it going door to door. This large house was the first one she visited before she was distracted. She was almost ready to walk out of there.
  
 
  
"Oh, well, you'll learn anyway," Aurora smiled. "C'mon, you can help me make the stuffing," She reached for Lana's hand, but she pulled away.
  
 
  
"I don't have time for this. I need to get back to selling my...," she started to protest. But, a delicious scent hit her nose and she saw Emily pulling a perfectly roasted golden turkey out of the oven. She used potholders to hold the pan that wasn't put in with it.
  
 
  
"What's going on?" she asked. Aurora smiled and tilted her head towards one of the stoves.
  
 
  
"I'll show you," she said. The teen grabbed a hanging pot and set it on the stove. Then, she went to the fridge and came back with a bowl of celery and onions and a large bag of diced, dried bread.
  
 
  
She met Lana's eyes and one by one added everything into the pot. Whole onions and celery stalks went in, then she tossed in the bag of bread and put the lid on. She turned the stove on.
  
 
  
"You'll learn more later; but, not all quests use simplified cooking like this. For some of the more advanced ones you actually have to cook things properly. But, I'm just showing Emily a few different  quests to get her used to it."
  
 
  
"Quests...?" Lana asked.
  
 
  
"Quests...," Aurora nodded. She turned the stove off, then pulled the lid off the pot. It released a large plume of steam and she tilted it slightly to show Lana the inside. It was fully cooked, perfectly moist stuffing despite no water being added. "..like in a game." 
  
 
  
"But.. this is reality...," Lana shook her head trying to make sense of everything. She noticed that the cooked turkey was on one of the tables surrounded by mashed potatoes, green beans, rolls, and more. And, Emily was still throwing things into the stove. Aurora shrugged and smiled.
  
 
  
"Welcome to the AlterNet," she said. "You've got a lot to learn."
