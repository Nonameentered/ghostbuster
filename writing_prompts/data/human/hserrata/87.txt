\[Boredom. Ruined.\] 

"Boring," Ruin changed the channel time and time again. "Boring." He sat upright on his leather couch and bored out of his mind. He was living in a cave up until recently and hoped that his new home would come with exciting things to do. He had access to millions of different channels from that many different Earths; but, there was nothing he wanted to watch. The wall-sized TV screen currently showed a pale vampire frightened by sunlight and cowering in a dark corner. "Boring," he said again and pressed the button to change the channel. Except the next channel still had the same scene with an offended vampire eyeing Ruin.
  
 
  
"Look pal," the vampire said. He stood from his corner and crossed his arms. "If you think everything is boring, just tell me what you want to watch," he said. Ruin narrowed his eyes at the TV first. Then, he took a cursory glance around his new apartment just in case he was missing some obvious signs of a prank.
  
 
  
"You talking to me?" Ruin asked. The vampire nodded. As he did, his pale skin disintegrated along with the dark, shadowy farm house set. In moments, a golden, faceless man stood in an empty white space. He wore a sharp red suit and had minor indentations where his eyes should have been.
  
 
  
"My name his Helios," the golden man bowed on the screen. "And I am, in fact, talking to you, Ruin," he said. "I can't help but notice how bored you've been since you got here."
  
 
  
"Here..?" He'd only had one big move recently. "You work for Chroma Corp.?" Ruin moved into an apartment provided by Chroma Corp. so it wasn't too big of a leap. But, Helios shook his head.
  
 
  
"I'm an AI that works for Sharp Development, in the entertainment division," he replied. He straightened the collar of his red blazer for effect. "You've been sitting in front of the TV for days saying all my programming is boring. So, you tell me what you want to watch," he said.
  
 
  
"I don't even know what's on," Ruin shrugged. "Too many channels." Helios shook his head.
  
 
  
"No no, you don't have to know what's on." As he spoke, he again took on the appearance of the vampire. The dim, shadowy barn formed around him, then an animated bat began flying around him. "I'll make a special episode just for you and show you anything you want to see."
  
 
  
"Anything?" Ruin perked up.
  
 
  
"Anything," Helios repeated.
  
 
  
"A woman with curly brown hair," Ruin said.
  
 
  
"Okay," Helios nodded as he changed form. "But, don't make it awkward for me," he added in his own voice once he was already a woman.
  
 
  
"Darker hair, curlier," Ruin said. The woman's hair seemed to shrink into her skull and her curls were tighter. "Bronze skin," he said. "Darker." She went from pale white to a richer, darker color.
  
 
  
"That's close..," Ruin nodded. "Put her in a wedding dress at a wedding." A white gown coalesced over her body as Helios walked into the from off screen. Waiters and waitresses scrambled around finishing last minute preparations around him.
  
 
  
"Now this is boring," Helios chuckled.
  
 
  
"You don't like weddings?" Ruin asked.
  
 
  
"What's to like?" Helios shrugged on the screen. "Good food? Dancing? Companionship? I'm an A.I.," he chuckled. "The bride is all wrong, though," Helios said. He held his hands at arms length and studied the woman through his framed hands. Then, he started mumbling to himself.
  
 
  
"A little darker..., taller...," the woman changed before Ruin's eyes and in an instant he was left slackjawed and speechless.
  
 
  
"There! That's better," Helios said. "Now that's a proper bride, don't you think?" He turned too seek Ruin's approval and found him staring at the bride.
  
 
  
"...Minerva...," Ruin said.
  
 
  
"Minerva?" Helios turned back to the bride, then he nodded. "oh yeah, I see it," he said. Then, he looked back at Ruin. "Who's Minerva?" he asked. "Why do I recognize her?"
  
 
  
"You do!?" Ruin left the couch and sank to his knees in front of the large TV. Helios nodded and shrugged.
  
 
  
"Yeah.. I can't put my finger on it, but I know her," he said.
  
 
  
"You're an A.I. aren't you?" Ruin asked. "You're connected to Sharp Development's database, right?" Helios nodded briefly, then shook his head.
  
 
  
"Like I said, I can't put my finger on it," he said. "I don't even know how I know her. All data surrounding Minerva has been deleted."
