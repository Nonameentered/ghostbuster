"Hello, Zoe," the strange, male voice startled Zoe. She was a light sleeper. Her eyes shot open and she sat up on her cot in a flash. Her cell was small and dark; she immediately spotted the well-dressed stranger. None of the other inmates noticed him, she was the only one awake. He wore a white suit with a red vest and tie underneath. He gave her a friendly smile when she noticed him; but, she pulled her legs up on the bed and scooted back against the brick wall.
  
 
  
"Who are you? What do you want?" Zoe kept her voice quiet. She didn't want to risk waking anyone else and scaring him away. She had no idea why he was there; but, it meant something that he snuck into her cell to greet her instead of waking her with violence. Prison life was the only thing Zoe could remember; but, she held out hope that there was something more out there.
  
 
  
"My name is Magnus," he lowered his head as he gave her a half-bow. Then, his smile grew wider. "Congratulations," he said. "You have been randomly chosen to gain omnipotence." He reached out and presented his hand. It took an extra moment for Zoe to realize he was offering her something. It was hard to see in the dim cell but a small rectangle of glass caught moonbeams from the window. "Here is your node," he said.
  
 
  
"Omnipotence?" Zoe inched forward on the cot as she asked her question. She eyed the transparent rectangle; but, she did not reach for it. "Why me?"
  
 
  
"Random drawing," Magnus shrugged while still holding the node out.
  
 
  
"From what pool? I didn't sign up for anything, I've been here forever," Zoe asked.
  
 
  
"Look, do you want omnipotence, or not?" Magnus wiggled the card at her. But, Zoe felt like something was off. She couldn't put her finger on it, but he did completely ignore her question. She might have been dreaming, or she might be ruining her only chance of ever getting out. Zoe crossed her arms and leaned back on the cot with an exaggerated shrug.
  
 
  
"Not if you're not going to answer any questions," she said. She stared him in the eyes and refused to blink.
  
 
  
"Fine," Magnus shrugged. If Zoe hadn't spent so much time behind bars training her intuition, she might not have heard the faint crack in his voice. "Then I'll just give it to someone else," he added. But, his tone was completely devoid of confidence. A tall black portal appeared next to him and he took a single step in. "...last chance, or it's gone forever...," he said. To his credit, he stepped into the portal completely and disappeared. Zoe was alone for a full 30 seconds before he walked back out of the portal like he was walking back into the room.
  
 
  
"Alright, look...," he said. "I'm just trying to do my job here. Will you take the node, please?" He offered it to her again. "I'm on a schedule." Zoe swallowed the grin that was fighting to come out and she shook her head to hide it.
  
 
  
"Not without some answers first," she said. Now that she felt like she had the upper hand, she decided being nice would be the best way to keep it. "It's only a few questions, and I'll ask them as fast as you can answer them," she said. 
  
 
  
"Okay....," Magnus sighed heavily as he nodded. He let his hand go slack and fall to his side while still holding the node.
  
 
  
"Why me?" Zoe asked. Magnus shrugged.
  
 
  
"Act of God, randomness, whatever you want to call it," he said. "Your name is on the list, my job is to give you the node." Zoe glanced at the piece of glass, then back at him.
  
 
  
"What's it do?" she asked.
  
 
  
"Anything you want," Magnus said. "Change the weather, change yourself, visit a different reality... it's omnipotence in card form."
  
 
  
"And it's mine? For free?" Zoe asked. Magnus nodded.
  
 
  
"As soon as you accept it," he replied.
  
 
  
"Okay," Zoe nodded and scooted closer. "One more question," she had plenty more; but, she promised to keep things brief.
  
 
  
"You already answered why you're giving it to me; but, how did I get picked? What did the rest of the pool look like?" As she finished her question, she held her hand out to accept the node. Magnus handed it to her and grinned.
  
 
  
"Your name was on the list, so you get one," he shrugged. "I'm just the delivery guy, I don't get to know how the decisions happen."
  
 
  
"But I mean... was I picked out of all the prisoners here or what? How did my name get involved?"
  
 
  
"Like I said...," Magnus shrugged. Another black portal opened next to him and Zoe realized he was about to leave. "....some call it random," he stepped into the portal but stayed half out. "Others, like myself, would call it an act of God."
  
 
  
"Act of ... God??" He'd used that phrase earlier and Zoe was realizing that maybe it wasn't a coincidence. "You're saying... God sent you to give this to me?" Even as she voiced the thought she wondered if she was insane. Magnus shrugged.
  
 
  
"I'm saying someone on God's level wanted you to have that."
  
 
  
"What? Who?" That answer gave Zoe more questions than she started out with. But, she was about to have even more. Magnus grinned and waved as the portal closed; both he and it were gone from her cell. But, he'd uttered one last reassurance before he disappeared.
  
 
  
"Don't worry, Ms. Sharp will be in touch."
