\[Concerning Inconsistency\]

"You... you can fix it, right?" Moose asked. The pro-wrestler-sized teenager sat beneath a beam of golden light. He visited his friend's shop to ask him to take a look at his command Slate; the text was garbled and he was limited to using Passive Abilities. And, he was unable to change his skills to try different ones. Moose chose to ask Turbo before he visited Sharp Development for repairs.
  
 
  
Turbo asked him to sit down and shined the golden light on him. Slates and nodes were tied to a user's soul and that's what Turbo was studying with the light. A translucent red visor covered his eyes and Moose could see text flying upward from the outside. They had been chatting while Turbo studied the information; but, he stopped. He was quiet for almost a minute before Moose felt nervous enough to break the silence.
  
 
  
"What?" Turbo looked up. He seemed to forget that Moose was there for a moment. "Yeah, yeah, fixing it is simple...," he said. Turbo placed his hands on the work table in front of him; it was a smooth white surface that had a soft glow. He put his fingers down and began typing. Red letters appeared for a brief moment under each fingertip, then disappeared again. At the same time, Moose could see red nanos wrapped around Turbo's wrists in the shape of letters. The small words glowed for a moment then disappeared to make way for more.
  
 
  
"Alright, try it now," Turbo nodded. Then, he shook his head; his visor disappeared with the shake.
  
 
  
Moose flicked his wrist upward to summon his Slate. The transparent glass pane hovered in front of him and he could clearly read all the text now. It would be translucent grey and unreadable to anyone else looking on. Out of curiosity, he tried disabling one of his Abilities and it responded.
  
 
  
"Hey, that worked! Thanks a ton, Turbo," Moose grinned. "You had me worried for a second there," he chuckled. "You looked surprised."
  
 
  
"Yeah...," Turbo nodded. He glanced around at the white walls of his shop. They matched his work surface. Then, he refocused on Moose. "... about that. Are you familiar with the B.A.A.?" he asked.
  
 
  
"The Bureau of Alternate Agencies?" Moose asked as he half-nodded. "I've heard of them...," he said. "Why?" It was quite a random question.
  
 
  
"I've seen this data corruption before," Turbo said. "The first time, I salvaged some [pictures for Ruby](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/wu41g5/wp_knowledge_is_power_and_any_selfrespecting/). But, I found an encrypted folder on your Slate.."
  
 
  
"Encrypted?" Moose asked. He shook his head in confusion. "I've only had it for a week, I haven't encrypted anything..." Turbo nodded in agreement but that only confused Moose more.
  
 
  
"You haven't... this time...," he said.
  
 
  
"Say what now?" Moose asked.
  
 
  
"I'm not sure what's going on yet," Turbo shrugged. "I have a few guesses; but, none of them are concrete enough to share. Instead, I think you should get in touch with the B.A.A. and give them access."
  
 
  
"You think they'll decrypt it for me?" Moose asked. Turbo shook his head with a slight grin.
  
 
  
"Nah, I already did that," he chuckled.
  
 
  
"So.. what's on it?" Turbo met Moose's eyes and his voice took on a more serious tone.
  
 
  
"Mission reports...," he said. "You were a B.A.A. agent."
  
 
  
"What?" Moose laughed. "Since when??" Turbo sighed.
  
 
  
"That's what I'm hoping we can find out."
