Simon had called it the tether. Gina got a clearer view of it as they neared the peak of the mountain, and she was disappointed to say the least. Instead of a stairway to heaven or even a giant beanstalk, there was only a cable that stretched up and up from this mountaintop base until it vanished into the sky. It looked uncannily like someone had stood several oil pipelines vertically instead of horizontally.

Looking at the cable in front of her now, Gina could hardly imagine the space station above the clouds and the moon just beyond it. All she could think of was the long boring elevator ride they were surely in for.

Simon was the space enthusiast of the two of them. Gina liked moonlit nights and starry skies just fine, but she had no desire to vacation in space. She could explore Titan and Europa just by putting on a VR headset and visiting NASA's official simulator. Why would she drop hundreds of dollars to spend hours in a cramped little tube and then three days in a tiny capsule pretending to be a lunar hotel?

"Here's the Skyhook," Simon said now. "The view's marvelous already! Much better than yet another garbage patch in the ocean, right?"

"I thought it would be..." Gina faltered. He'd said he would let her pick a cruise for their next holiday. "I don't know. More sparkly?"

Simon gave her that look, like he was humoring her only because he knew so much more than her.

"Why would it sparkle?"

"I mean, you said the tether was made of diamond nanothread," Gina replied. "Diamonds sparkle, so why not diamond nanothreads?"

Simon snorted. If he appreciated that she remembered part of his endless rants about spacefaring technology, he didn't show it.

"Shouldn't have brought up diamonds," he muttered. "Women get so weird about them."

Then he grinned at her, that bright infectious smile she fell for, and it was easier to smile back than to pursue the topic.

"Come on, Gina. Let's see the stars."

The climber was nuclear-powered. It switched to solar power after about forty kilometers, and some energy was stored in the nanothread cables themselves.

Beyond that, it felt exactly like the elevator ride Gina had been dreading. She wanted to ask who had decided to build this metal tube with no windows and why, but she didn't feel like sitting through yet another physics lecture from Simon. His spiel about how this particular elevator ride was being powered was bad enough.

This really was enough for him, she realized. He would have been just as happy staying back on Earth and lecturing clueless laypeople on the physics of space elevators, as an enthusiastic and somewhat informed layperson.

She could focus on the view waiting for them at the lunar hotel. Or she could spend each passing hour daydreaming about their return to Earth and planning their next vacation.

Garbage patches in the ocean had never sounded more appealing.
