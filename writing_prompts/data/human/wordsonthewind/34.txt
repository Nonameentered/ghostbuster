Hi Ginger! This was an interesting format choice. You did a good job matching the tone and narrative style of those nature documentaries! I appreciated that subtle drop of the fact that these turtles are gigantic. 

>	The seemingly endless stretch of wasteland between the hatchlings and the sea is a minefield of Graveyard Crabs. With fastidious timing, the crustaceans wait until they feel the tremors above.

I feel like this paragraph might have flowed better if it was placed right after the description of the Graveyard Crab. It would set up the following drama and struggle for survival well. 

Good words!
