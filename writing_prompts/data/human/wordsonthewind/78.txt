A neat little ghost story! The descriptions of the oncoming storm and the rough barnacle-covered rocks were quite evocative. 

This bit stood out to me:

>	Thankfully, someone brought a first aid kit over and cleaned and bandaged my wounds.

The narrator's friend is mentioned later on, so I feel like there isn't really a need for a "someone" here. It looks like something that the narrator's friend could easily do. 

These are my thoughts. I hope this helps!
