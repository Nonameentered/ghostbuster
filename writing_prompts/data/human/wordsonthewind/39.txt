The festival had collected many names in Athon in the thirty years since it was first celebrated. It had been called the Summer of Abandon, the Time of Colors, and Hijinks Day. But Max had grown up calling it Independence Day and this was how he would always think of it. Even if his children had forgotten the meaning of the celebrations.

"Rise and shine, sleepyheads!" he'd yelled that morning as he threw open their curtains. Of course they dove right back under their covers. The hissing was a bit much, he thought, even if they really should have been up by now. The sun had been out for hours.

"Daaaad!" Lana and Jamie whined. "It's a holiday! Can't we sleep in for once?"

They'd embraced a trend he could only think of as neo-apathy recently, but they were still willing to humor their old man on this special day. That brought a smile to Max's face.

He wouldn't say that out loud, of course.

"Nooo, you silly-billies! Holidays mean special holiday meals, and you can't eat in bed. Up you get!"

That brought Lana and Jamie out of bed in a flash. Faster than they ever managed on a school day, they were dressed and ready to head out to the festivities.

Emotions flowed freely on Independence Day. Those who already wore their hearts on their sleeves embraced it; bursting into song whenever the mood took them, greeting friends and family with even more enthusiasm than usual. The more reserved tended to go silent completely, only communicating through extravagant gestures and body language. 

Lana and Jamie had chosen the latter route. Goofing off in the privacy of home was one thing, but they were teenagers, and there was only so much their dignity could take.

Jamie stopped now, pointing insistently at one of the stalls. After a moment, his sister followed suit. 

A closer look quickly told Max why it had caught their attention. Amidst the clamour and noise of all the other street vendors hawking their wares, this man was completely silent. His cart was as colorful as any of the others around him and he had a set of wind chimes enchanted to have a strangely penetrating sound, now that Max was listening for it, but he wasn't shouting or calling out to prospective customers. He simply bowed invitingly and waved as they walked past. 

How did this man expect to sell anything? Max followed his children over. 

The cart had several tiny glass animals on display. Some were protective wards and good-luck talismans judging from the way they moved. Others were simply well-made trinkets. Lana seemed particularly taken with a little glass rabbit that twitched its nose in her hands. 

"Good morning, sir!" Max greeted the stall owner with his best smile. He waved to the glass rabbit in his daughter's hand. "How much for this?"

With a flourish, the other man pulled out a card and presented it to him. Max squinted at the list of prices. Even if he was committed to this way of self-expression, surely this was going a bit too far?

"Do you speak, sir?"

Lana and Jamie immediately shot him offended looks. But the man just smiled. Then he opened his mouth. 

Revealing the silvery stump where his tongue should have been. 

One of the harshest punishments of the Bright-Souled. All thoughts of bargaining flew out of Max's head. 

It had been nearly half a century since the Bright-Souled were overthrown. A pretty name for the ugly truth at their core. Their souls were cold shriveled things that barely stayed in their bodies, so they fed on the emotions of others. They enforced a cold emotionless conformity on the territories they ruled.

No colors were allowed when the Bright-Souled ruled. Nothing could be allowed to exceed the burning fires of their stolen spirit. But that was nothing compared to the restrictions they placed on the people.

All emotion was forbidden. Love, anger, sadness: all were deemed obscene and the most selfish of actions. Roses froze in winter and so did mercy and kindness under the enforced indifference the Bright-Souled forced on them.

This man had grieved the death of a loved one in public. That was the most likely reason for that kind of emotional display. For that, the Bright-Souled had torn out his tongue.  

Max paid, resolving to participate extra hard in the fireworks now, the singing and dancing in the streets. It was bold in its statement. This was their heritage. They had taken back what was theirs.
