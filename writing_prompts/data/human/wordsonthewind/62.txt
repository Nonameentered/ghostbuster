The pancake batter was already in the skillet by the time the Counsellor emerged from his quarters. Nora hummed as she checked on the bacon and scrambled eggs in the other pans. Her fellow believers were already preparing the cheeses, cold cuts, and fruit juices. This part was her test and hers alone. 

She had never been such a real person as she was today. The Rite of Reflections left everyone feeling a little blank at first, but the Counsellor had only been too glad to give her a brief summary of who she once was.

The first Nora had gone through life feeling like there was something missing. People called her scatterbrained until she started to believe it herself. As a child she routinely forgot her gym kit at school and had to borrow spare shirts and exercise shorts from the lost-and-found. As an adult she hadn't improved. Her room was never clean. She floundered through life, looking for something she couldn't even name. 

The Rite of Reflections had smoothed all of that away. Leaving her ready to receive her Counsellor's mentorship and guidance. With his help, she would shape herself into someone new.

She used the skills she'd gained even now. Especially now. Mirrors were gateways to alternate realities and she communed with them through her reflection. She borrowed knowledge and abilities from her other selves: cooking, multitasking, organizational skills. But she had to embrangle all this new knowledge with her history to make it truly hers. Which was why she was overseeing breakfast duty today.

The Counsellor always had wonderful ideas like that. Not for the first or last time, Nora thought about how lucky she was to have met him.

"Nora." His voice sounded from behind her. Warm arms wrapped around her shoulders, and she relaxed into his embrace. She didn't stiffen or freeze. That was a holdover from the Rite, surely.

"You're doing well," he said. "Get yourself a glass of juice. I can scramble my own eggs."

Her heart pounded just from the nearness of him. "They're almost ready, Counselor. I can hardly remember a time when I didn't screw up. Won't you let me have this moment of triumph?"

"I can't believe what you say," he told Nora, "because I see what you do. You've truly blossomed as you communed with the whole of your being, spread across the worlds and histories. You've mentored the newcomers and led sessions in the Contemplation Room." 

He nuzzled her neck. "Have breakfast with your fellow believers, my second-in-command. You deserve it."

"Yes, Counsellor."

The smile never left her face as she joined the others in the dining area. 

What did her life before matter? She was happy.
