Sometimes you need to scorch everything to the ground and start over. Cori knew this well. She'd done it four times before, and now she was looking at a fifth.

Her parents posted bail the first time she landed in jail for arson. They wouldn't come to her rescue now. She lost contact with them years ago. 

They were just too different. They'd immigrated here, like several of her friends' families had, leaving behind the home and community they'd known all their lives to seek out new opportunities in a strange place. But where her friends' parents clung to tradition and became fanatical about their culture, Cori's parents were the opposite. 

They called it putting down roots, but to Cori it looked more like they wanted to disappear into their new society. They held on to everything. The rusty clunker that would have paid for a new car in repair costs alone by now. Her old school projects and report cards, a time capsule of the good little girl she had once been. She remembered those times well. She'd loved the flawless grades and glowing praise from teachers until she had cause to reevaluate her life in high school and consider where that would really lead her. 

She wanted more than anything else to be one of the movers and shakers who strode across this world. And here she was learning to do as she was told!

She checked out after that. It was the only thing that made sense to do. The game was no fun anymore now that the rules were laid bare. People talked, teachers tried to reach out. She ignored them all. 

Until the day she overheard Brianna brag that she was at the top of the class now that the bell curve was no longer being skewed. That day, Cori snuck into the teachers' lounge after school, found a stray lighter the gym coach had left behind, and put Brianna's term paper to the flames. It would have been the perfect crime if not for the extra chess club meeting that week. She didn't know why they took competitions so seriously. They'd started way too late, not like those prodigy children who played their first games in diapers, so why bother? 

The flames whispered to her from a cigarette in the ashtray outside. 

"I have an interest in the outsider," the fiery figure said. "The underdogs, the outcasts. The ones the world refuses to understand."

"Who are you?" She asked. Maybe she had finally snapped and she was just conjuring this figure from the dancing light of the cigarette. 

"I am the fires of His Forge, the crucible of heroism and tragedy." It sounded like a bad fantasy novel but she wasn't going to tell it to stop. "And you interest me. I have need of a champion."

She raised an eyebrow. "I'm down if it gets me out of here."

"That can be arranged," the fire said. "Only swear a binding oath to act as my agent in this realm. I will help you fulfil it."

"Are you going to tell me that I should act as a champion worthy of you?" she said bitterly. "That I should stop fucking up so much?"

It tilted its head. "Why would I? Every time you find something that doesn't work, you're a step closer to what does work. Experiment, my champion. Find your path and spread my flame in your wake."

The police station burned down after her parents posted her bail. All evidence against her was lost in the fire. 

Her life since then had been more of the same. At times she tried to settle down and build a life for herself. But every time, she'd look around and see how much happier everyone else was, how much more progress they'd made in the same period of time. And always she would turn to the one thing she was good at. The one mentor who never let her down. 

She struck the match and let her latest home burn. 

"It's the same everywhere I go," she whispered into the roaring flames. "I am haunted by humans."
