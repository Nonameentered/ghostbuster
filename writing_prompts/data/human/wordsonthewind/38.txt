Hi Xack! What a deadly pool party this is. I liked the little hints you sprinkled throughout of the true nature of the party hosts, from their appearances to Mr Ulah's pet name for Vic. The only one I can't place is Cindy. I wondered if her voice was related because hers was the only one described in some detail, but it seemed to be a red herring. Acrostic puzzles are tricky like that, I guess. 

Good words!
