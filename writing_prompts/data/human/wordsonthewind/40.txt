Hi Ryter! This was an amazing way to work in the previous theme words. The bits of lyrics were fun to read, and I liked how performing from the heart turned out to be the key to winning everyone over. I would have appreciated seeing a snippet of Fairytale Endings though, just for the contrast. Maybe a note on how Grace's performance would have changed with her determination not to be chased off the stage by an angry audience too. 

Good words!
