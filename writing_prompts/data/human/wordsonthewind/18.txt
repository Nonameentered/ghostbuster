I'd just wanted a challenge. Challenges were huge on Gather, but I always missed out on the next big thing. If I couldn't be trendy, maybe being weird was the way to go. Pranks were out, drugs too. But brain-hacking and internet rumors looked promising. 

That was how I learned about the disappearance of Henry Piker.

No one remembered when it started. It was one of those internet legends, retold until the truth became just another way things might have happened. His name varied as well. But the sources I traced to their roots, the ones that weren't copies of copies, all called him Henry Piker.

He was good at two things: playing the violin, and feeling sorry for himself. He had taken certain corners of the internet by storm a few years back and then disappeared just as abruptly. No one had heard from him since.

It should have been nothing special. A content creator shows up out of nowhere, goes unexpectedly viral, then fades back into obscurity as people latch on to the next big thing. Just another day on the internet. 

But two things stood out to me about Henry Piker. His cursed music, and the last fateful stream he recorded before his disappearance. 

Nobody knew what had happened on that stream, but not for lack of anyone willing to talk. No, there were far too many stories about it. A deranged fan broke in and murdered him. He shot himself live on air. The police wrongfully arrested him instead of the pothead next door. The fake videos and dramatic reenactments that were just elaborate excuses to troll people didn't help either.

Even worse, videos claiming to be real footage from the incident occasionally surfaced on various video and streaming sites. But they would always be taken down before I could save them, let alone watch them. 

His music was cursed only in the sense that it was weird. He recorded instrumentals at first: his original compositions, a few arrangements of popular songs. After a while he began including lyrics. But his words were too sad or too disturbing, dragging me down even as his music soared. Sometimes he would write something straightforward, a happy song or a melancholic little piece, but inevitably he would poke a hole in it like he had just been sarcastic the whole time.

My roast video of it got me several thousand views and a mention from a reviewer of outsider art. 

I watched his other streams. There was definitely something off about him. He would start normally enough, greeting his audience, addressing a few regulars by their handles. Then he played and it was like the world fell away. He ignored requests. He ignored the abuse from chat, the blasts from the Honk feature. He played over them all.  

I tried searching for his social media. You could hide a needle in a haystack, but this was the equivalent of hiding a needle in a needle factory. Who knew that Henry Piker was such a common name?

Things started going wrong for me after that. My card would be declined. I'd get locked out of all my accounts for no reason. I didn't stop though. I didn't think I could, now that I had this sign that I was getting somewhere. 

"You're wasting your time chasing these wild theories and unverified rumors," my dad said to me once as I hunched over my laptop. "He probably just got tired of trying to make it big in the music industry and got a day job instead."

I never did find Henry Piker in the end. But one of his friends found me. 

The email and accompanying attachment were cleverly disguised. I'd barely double-clicked the supposed offer letter before screamers filled my screen. They shrieked bloody murder too, but somehow my computer had become unresponsive to all input. I had to unplug it to get the videos to stop playing. 

The message in big red letters stayed throughout the compilation of videos. 

*LEAVE HIM ALONE. THIS IS YOUR ONLY WARNING.*

 I deleted my Gather page. But not before making one last post about how I was being targeted. By a gang of stalkers, by aliens. It didn't matter. 

In the end my mom was right: social media ruined my life. 

But it was a good story. Who cared if it was true or not?
