St Anne's Preparatory School for Girls prided itself on its godly environment. They forbade all worldly things. Day-trips into town without at least one nun chaperoning. Sugary drinks and snacks. Talking to boys. 

Naturally, we found other entertainments. 

My grandmother, mother, and three older sisters had all attended St Anne's, so I knew the best games. Bloody Mary was a hotly sought-after guest at dorm parties. I massaged my friends' temples as they sought out doors in the corridors of their minds. The nuns complimented our diligent study of scripture, but moments earlier they would have seen our fingers hovering over the bibles, ready to point at whatever verse it opened to as the answer to our unasked questions. 

Ava never joined in. She was a recent transfer who had only ever attended day school. She rubbed everyone the wrong way in her first week. When we tried to summon Bloody Mary, she shrieked and fled the room.

Rumors swarmed around her like flies. Her parents had been in some mirror-worshiping cult that combined new-age rituals with weird ideas from physics. Then they all died in a freaky mass-suicide. Ava was the only survivor. Now she lived with a distant relative who saw her as an annoyance to only be tolerated for the holidays.

None of that mattered compared to what we saw every day. She was quiet. She screamed her head off when we tried to get her to play Bloody Mary. We weren't saints, but we would have stopped every petty remark and prank if she showed some spine. 

But Ava only became quieter and stranger. She would go into the bathroom and just stare at her reflection. The nuns tried to make us get along. They instituted a buddy system and assigned us to her on a weekly rotating basis. It might have worked if we were five years old, but not fifteen-going-on-sixteen.

Then one day, a different Ava came down for breakfast. 

"You look different," I said. "You know, Sister Agatha will really let you have it if she catches you wearing makeup." 

"More like a whole facelift, Liz," Geraldine snorted.

Something about her eyes had changed. Or maybe it was her whole face. 

Ava smiled. "Interesting words coming from you, Geri."

Geraldine blushed, and we thought Ava was referring to the nose job Geraldine's mother had finally agreed to let her get on her birthday.

Ava won everyone over in the following weeks and months. She apologized for getting off on the wrong foot. She stopped freaking out around mirrors.

But when she finally joined us, ready to take her turn at summoning a ghost from a mirror, her reflection never smiled. When she accidentally looked away from the mirror, it stared at us a moment longer before dropping its gaze too.

I never played Bloody Mary when Ava was around again.
