\[Poem\]

You always knew how to make me feel small

In your defense, what you did was no crime

Maybe someday I won't care at all

&#x200B;

On your own you could never stand tall

Everyone else had to remain supine

You always knew how to make me feel small

&#x200B;

I learned to hide, to build up walls

which, to you, was rebellion's neon sign

Maybe someday I won't care at all

&#x200B;

You deserved perfection, obedient dolls

Disagreement crossed a dangerous line

You always knew how to make me feel small

&#x200B;

But then, why should the gardener recall

each cut and snip made to prune the vine?

Maybe someday I won't care at all.

&#x200B;

I'll be at a party when I get the call

I'll hang up, keep dancing. This is my time.

You always knew how to make me feel small

and now, today, I don't care at all
