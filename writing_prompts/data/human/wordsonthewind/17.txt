Hi Bay! This was chilling for sure. I really liked the descriptions of the narrator's dead and rotting state. Apate's petty gloating was also a great touch that established her antagonist cred well. Great job!

As for crit, I think I'd have liked to see more of the Others that Apate screwed over. The ending where the narrator meets them and they form their pact to get revenge felt kind of sudden to me, that's all. 

Good words!
