Hi Xack! I liked the characterization and worldbuilding in this piece. The first line in particular was an evocative snapshot of Dolomite's character. And the McClod brothers' rivalry was amusingly and realistically shown as well :D

I must say, I didn't really understand what Slam did when he "leered his beard" at his brother. I think you wanted to put focus on the beard but what came to mind for me was his beard literally bristling because all the hair in it was prehensile. Just my two cents. 

These are my thoughts. I hope this helps!
