1.	Parousia sounds really cool. I prefer nice cool breezes which don't sting my eyes or flip papers off nearby surfaces. 
2.	Music (with lyrics or otherwise), people-watching, eavesdropping on conversations in public. I realize that's not *a* favorite but it's an even split between those three. 
3.	Um... I like them all in different ways? Going with that for now
