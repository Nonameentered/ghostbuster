There are no angels in hell. Angels have form and function. We spurned our functions, so now we have neither. 
  


All we have is one another. We flow into and among ourselves, but unity and harmony in that state is beyond us. Our proximity only fuels irritation and discord. 
  


Hell has no true light or darkness. What passes for light in hell is searing, blinding, burning brightness. What passes for darkness in hell is something far worse than an absence of light. The darkness of hell gives no respite from its light. It does not allow the peace of sleep. It is a darkness that hides monsters and stokes every paranoid fear of the unknown.
  


The darkness is us. It is our new body and our prison in this twisted parody of heaven we tried to build.
  


The humans here don't notice. They're too wrapped up in their rage and spite. It consumed them in life until they willingly walked into hell and away from everything good so that they wouldn't have to give it up. And now they inflict it on other humans for every reason they can think of. For territory, to justify their own suffering, just because they can.
  


We don't torture them. We can't even touch them. 
  


We made our own hell. Now it's their turn to make theirs.
