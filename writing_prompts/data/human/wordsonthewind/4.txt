After the last scary movie night I had in my old apartment, my roommate Katherine turned to me and said, "Sometimes I just want to cut your face off and wear it."
  

  
I just assumed she was joking. A lot of her jokes were like that. For one thing, she was very insistent that nobody called her anything else. My boyfriend Tom learned that the hard way when I first invited him over. 
  

  
"Kate- can I call you Kate?" he'd asked her. "I have a Great-Aunt Katherine so it's an old-lady name for me."
  

  
Katherine only shrugged. But the next time he stayed the night, he opened his designated drawer the next morning only to find that all of his underwear had been shredded. Worse, she dumped out the bottle of Jargogle Stout he'd been keeping in our fridge.
  

  
I was fully prepared to be the one staying over from then on. In hindsight, I should have worried more that it failed to send him packing.
  

  
"We all go a little mad sometimes," he said instead. "Your roommate's a real character. Could you tell her I'm sorry about the nickname thing?"
  

  
I punched him lightly on the arm. "Just remember that you're mine first, buster."
  

  
He laughed and I took that as a good sign.
  

  
I couldn't understand her. She was pretty, she had no shortage of friends or admirers, and she certainly never worried about money. Yet she seemed to swing between fawning adoration and cold resentment at the drop of a hat. She hated red and thought flowers were dull, but when I bought a crimson dress with a floral pattern for my date she had a similar dress the very next day. I would have said she envied me, but I couldn't see why.
  

  
She used to just sit on the couch and scroll through her social media. Everything she didn't like was made up for views or clout. Unless they were her close friends, in which case they were just rubbing their superiority in her face.  
  

  
"They're all so happy, so successful," she said. "It makes me sick."
  

  
"What about you?" I asked. "You're not doing so bad yourself."
  

  
She tossed her phone aside. "It's not the same. They don't even have to try."
  

  
"I'll have you know Tom works very hard for that bod." I smiled, hoping to lighten the mood.
  

  
"I'm sure he does," she said sourly.
  

  
A change of tactics was in order.
  

  
"You know those are only moments, right?" I said. "Who knows what they're leaving out... Why not take up photography? Then you can capture all the moments you want."
  

  
She scowled. "No. Too close to my sister's thing."
  

  
She'd never mentioned her family before. No matter how I asked, she never brought it up again.
  

  
Tom started seeing me less often. He became distant, almost cold. He had never been cold to me before. I refused to put the pieces together until they were all shoved in my face at once. 
  

  
Katherine hadn't dyed her hair or changed anything about her body, but in every way else she was now identical to me. She did her makeup the same way, wore the style of clothes I liked. She kissed Tom full on the lips, smiling like the cat who got the cream.  
  

  
"Why?" For all my anger, it came out as a plea, begging her to explain herself. "You could have any man you wanted. Why Tom?"
  

  
She sneered. "You never understood anything. I didn't want just any man. I wanted him."
  

  
"Sorry, babe," Tom said. "But a man needs to feel like he's appreciated, you know? You were always just as happy sitting on the couch in your PJs and watching cheesy dramas as you were at all the fancy dates I planned. I need someone who's less of a slob."
  

  
I couldn't be around her anymore after that. I found a cheaper place and settled my last month of rent in advance with the landlord. Katherine and Tom helped with the move, but not out of remorse.
  

  
"I showed you the truth about me," she said. "Just like you wanted."
  

  
I stared at her. "Your truths are worse than your lies."
  

  
That was two years ago. I still look them up occasionally. Tom got promoted to regional director. Katherine won a coveted award in her chosen field. They go on the most romantic dates and fun spontaneous vacations.
  

  
Sometimes I wonder what they're leaving out, but I know them too well. They would be happy with appearances no matter what the rest of their life looked like. I can only stew in my own misery.
  

  
They really are perfect for each other.
