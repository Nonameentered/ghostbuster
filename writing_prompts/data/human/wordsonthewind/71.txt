Hi Fye! I feel like you've been hard at work giving crit to everyone for a while. I appreciate the feedback!

>I'm just curious about the rhyming scheme here. At first, I thought it would be an 'A B A B' scheme but that doesn't seem to fit. Most lines seem to rhyme with "all", but then you have a couple of random lines with different rhymes that don't seem to fit.

It's a [villanelle](https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Villanelle)! The link has an explanation of the rhyme scheme. It's one of my favorite poetic forms to read and write. Those repeating lines can do so much. ["Do not go gentle into that good night"](https://poets.org/poem/do-not-go-gentle-good-night) and ["Mad Girl's Love Song"](https://allpoetry.com/Mad-Girl's-Love-Song) really opened my eyes to what the form could do. ["One Art"](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47536/one-art) plays more loosely with it and inspired me to do the same.

(also it doesn't hurt that coming up with a nice rhyming couplet means a good chunk of the poem is already done. and the rhyme scheme helps me organize my thoughts and think of imagery because free verse scares the pants off me)

Your idea sounds like an interesting medium between structured form and free verse though. I'll keep it in mind the next time I write a poem for TT. I'll call that structure the Fye :P

Thanks for reading!

PS: I thought reddit ate my stanzas because the formatting looked weird to me when I first posted it, but it looks fine now if a bit more spacey than I wanted. Not sure how much that means. At least it's not just one big chunk?
