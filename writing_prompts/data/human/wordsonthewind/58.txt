The last man in the world was having the time of his life. 

He knew what it looked like for everyone else. To them, the world had ended for reasons they would never understand. Everyone other than a lucky, or unlucky, few, had simply collapsed where they stood. Their hearts stopped beating, their minds ceased to function. Even their souls vanished in an instant. It was like they were puppets whose strings had been cut. 

The survivors took it badly. Some of them fought and killed one another in the streets, attempting to find something to blame for their misfortune. Others obsessed over discovering a cure or at least an explanation, and died at their workbenches and desks without ever learning more. 

A few people lay down next to their deceased loved ones, curled up and waited for the inevitable. He took special care to preserve those bodies. 

He'd always been a romantic at heart. 

He drew power from death as a necromancer. Now that everything was suffused in it, he had the world's largest doll collection and all the time he could ever want to play with it. 

He dressed them in grand uniforms and paraded them through the streets. At his will, they divided themselves into groups and fought with the fearlessness and implacability of the dead. It was breathtaking to watch. He marvelled at his strategic prowess. 

He played monarch, with the dead as his loyal subjects. Of course some of them had to commit the occasional betrayal so that he could cleverly spot their plotting and execute them for treason, but it was still what he wanted. So really, they were all faithful to him in the end. No other king could have said as much while they still lived.

Sometimes he had deep conversations with the dead, pouring out his heart and soul to them. They listened. Sometimes they spoke. 

*"Lonely boy in a world of dolls,"* they rasped through ruined throats and desiccated lungs. *"You can't pretend forever."*

They all said the same thing eventually. He only smiled. 

"They tried to make me live in their world," he said. "But now, you've died in mine."

A wave, and their arms and legs wrenched themselves out of their sockets. The dead screamed as best as they could, but he paid them no mind. The parts pile was always growing, and he had plenty of ideas for projects. 

"How does it feel?"
