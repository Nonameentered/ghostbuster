*\[Inscribed on a clay tablet discovered in Mesopotamia.\]*
  

  
You who find these clay tablets, say this to your masters:
  

  
Here I inscribe my strange foray into the past of my home city. It is no epic tale. I am a merchant by profession, not a storyteller. Many have hurled invectives at me about the trade I have chosen. Doubtless they will say similar things about my tale. 
  

  
This was the start of it all: a dissatisfied customer who had invited himself to my house to select the copper ingots to which he felt he was entitled. He was no maker of bronze arms. He had no reason to demand such outrageously high quality as he did. I told him so and this displeased him greatly. We came to blows and I found myself shoved into a thoroughfare where bullock carts routinely passed through. 
  

  
Before I could gather my wits or get out of the way, one of the carts juddered over me and I felt myself knocked an unfathomably far distance. When I landed on the ground once more, the world around me had changed. The roads were narrower, buildings stood in different places. I got up and began searching for my neighbors, but I saw not one familiar face.
  

  
I asked anyone who would answer who ruled in Ur, and found that it was the twelfth year of Ur-Nammu's reign. This shocked me greatly, as to the best of my knowledge Samsu-iluna had just begun his reign before I was thrown into this strange and foreign Ur.
  

  
I anticipated a role in the wars and conquests of Ur-Nammu, but the battles were over long before I arrived. The consolidation was done. A peace that would last ages was already being built.  
  

  
Copper has its uses even in times of peace, but I cannot make use of my contacts in the Persian Gulf. Still, I have made my living in trade for a long time. I can buy and sell more than just copper.
  

  
I know what is to come as well. My past is their future. Someday, Ur-Nammu's son will build a wall around the Sumer border to keep out the Martu, and I will be there to help.
  

  
How can it be otherwise, with this foreknowledge granted to me?
