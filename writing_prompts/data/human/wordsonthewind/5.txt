Everyone knew the east wing was haunted. It had never bothered Amelie. Her father put those ghosts there, after all. 

The royal family had their own particular hobbies. Her father collected ghosts. He didn't go out with salt and fire to hunt them himself, of course. He had men for that. The church exorcists banished demons immediately, but every tenth ghost was given to him. He called it a tithe and smiled like he was making a joke. Amelie was confused. 

"You'll understand when you're older," he only said, ruffling her hair. 

One rainy afternoon her tutor had fallen ill, so Amelie went exploring. She cracked open the high door to the east wing with barely any hesitation. There were ghosts, yes, but they belonged to her father. He would keep her safe. 

She passed gilt-edged urns painted in elaborate patterns. She peered into rooms piled high with trinkets and papers. The ghosts inside gibbered faintly, but they probably talked nonsense as people too. That was just how peasants were. 

"You're lucky," she said to a crystal ball that was violently rocking back and forth. "You were a pig farmer or whatever and now you live in a palace. Isn't Father generous?"

The ball stopped. 

*I'm not living.*

That thought wasn't hers. It was like being distantly aware of someone talking from the next room, their voice faint and far away. 

*I never farmed pigs either. I never lived.* 

Amelie frowned. "All ghosts were alive."

*If you died and a seed fell in your grave, is the tree that then grows you?* 

"What are you?" she asked. 

The ball resumed rocking. 

*Break this ball and see for yourself.* 

Amelie knew then. She backed away, leaving the ball to its impotent rocking, and left the east wing. All poltergeists were liars.
