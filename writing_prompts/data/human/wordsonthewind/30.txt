All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. Sometimes Tom thought about that old saying when he went home for the holidays. Whoever came up with that line should've met his family. Maybe then they'd write something better.
  
All his other classmates had good families. Their parents were goofballs, or stern but loving, or rushed off their feet by life's myriad demands but still willing to make an effort. They had traditions and in-jokes which they displayed casually in front of guests, which Tom could only observe as an outsider to their domestic bliss.
  
But his family... his family was just disgustingly banal.
  
Tom wondered when exactly every old person in his extended family went mad. How had he not noticed? They'd babysat him when he was little, brought his cousins over to play. But now they swallowed every bit of fake news they came across hook, line and sinker. And he wasn't supposed to call them out on it or fact-check them right then and there, because family was family.
  
At fifty everyone has the face he deserves. His mother's camera-ready smile was permanently in place, for all that the skin around her eyes remained smooth and wrinkle-free. Uncle George's scowling haggard visage was certainly richly deserved.
  
"We lost because we told ourselves we lost." A wave of his fork, complete with chunk of impaled turkey meat, served to punctuate that statement. "We outnumbered those bastards ten to one. Shoulda just swept over them and kept going. Show them just who they were messing with when they conjured up all those ballots from nowhere."
  
Uncle George didn't just love beating a dead horse. He would exhume its grave and visit all manner of indignities upon its person. But that was easier to ignore when he was ranting about incompetent coworkers or the tech-obsessed youth of today. At this rate he would start on "those goddamn Reds" next and then they'd all be back in the '50s.
  
"Everyone has a plan until they get charged with treason," Tom said instead.
  
His relatives looked at him as though Tom had started talking about the price of coffee in Catalonia.
  
"Be nice, Tommy," his mother murmured before raising her voice to address everyone else. "Who wants seconds!?" 
  
Tom had a growlery. A little space in the attic with a desk and a futon, now that his bedroom had been converted into a home office for his dad. His mother had given him special permission to set it up, or at least not stopped him doing it which was basically the same thing. Retreating to it at a family gathering was strictly forbidden, however. Unless...?
  
"Aunt June," he said to the older woman seated opposite him. "Mom wanted me to ask you: how was the new hair salon? Was it any good?"
  
Everyone treated Facebook as their personal blog at first. Tom knew better by now, but some people didn't. Thank goodness for that, he thought, as Aunt June scowled right on cue.
  
"I didn't even go. The governor decided to announce yet another lockdown and trap everyone in their homes right when I'd planned that day out to celebrate my freedom..."
  
She went on an extra tangent about dropping by Bobby's dorm to make sure he was still going to church physically instead of living in fear and holing up in his room. It didn't matter. Tom knew Aunt June well, or at least the Aunt June she'd become after steady exposure to the worst of what social media algorithms could throw at her. She returned to one topic time and again.
  
"...and the rules are just what they come up with to herd the sheeple into their comfortable cages, so-"
  
"Great!" Tom jumped up. "I knew you'd understand, auntie. I'm going to my room. Don't wait up!'
  
He took the stairs two at a time. As soon as he was safely in the attic, he locked the door, then wheeled the desk around to block it. A quick check of his phone told him that the latest season of his favorite reality TV show had finished downloading. 
  
Tom sank onto the futon with a sigh of relief. He loved Big Brother.
