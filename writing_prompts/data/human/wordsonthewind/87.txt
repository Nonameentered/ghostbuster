Once, when the moon was young and the seas were fresh, two sisters lived with their mother in a place where the veil between worlds was thin. 
  

  
Grace had an ethereal beauty and swift and dexterous hands. She kept herself busy and kept out of the way. Mal had iron in her bones and fire in her belly. People feared her spitfire ways and iron-born strength.
  

  
Their mother saw herself in Mal, before time and chance rusted her and dulled her fires, and doted on the younger girl. In contrast, part of her scoffed at her older daughter's meekness. How could she stand up to the cruelty of the world without a fire inside?
  

  
But the sisters loved each other still. One year, when the winter was too harsh for all of them to survive, Grace took the crossbow and arrows that had once belonged to their father, put on her cloak, and left.
  

  
It was not a hunt. She had no hope of finding anything. But as she walked through the snow she saw a beautiful ice palace in the distance. It blurred and unblurred, changing slightly in appearance each time, but it was inviting nonetheless.
  

  
"It is only a mirage," she told herself, but each step brought the palace closer. 
  

  
Presently she met a mouse and its children shivering in the snow.
  

  
"Please," the mouse called out to her. "The weather is so cold, and I must shield my babies from it or they will die."
  

  
"You poor thing," she said, and tore strips off her cloak. It was threadbare, worn to give a respectable air to her tale of going hunting. But woven with nimble fingers, it would keep a mouse nest warm easily.
  

  
 She walked on. The cold hit her like a boulder and her arrows broke. Her crossbow broke. And she was on the doorstep of the ice palace, face to face with an androgynous man with ice-blue eyes and diamonds for teeth. He was beautiful, but his hands were the bluish gray of one who had frozen to death.
  

  
She understood in that moment, and almost wished she had died in the snow. 
  

  
"I'd like to request a contract, milord," she said instead. 
  

  
The man nodded. "Work for me for a year and a day, and I will give you what you want most."
  

  
So for a year and a day she kept the ice palace clean as it endlessly rebuilt itself. She did a thousand other tiny tasks besides, and when her time was up she ate the ice berries the Winter King offered her.
  

  
Her mother and sister were surprised when she returned in spring, silent and cool to the touch but very much alive. Any lingering doubts her mother had were resolved when she brushed her hair and dozens of diamonds clattered to the floor.
  

  
"Where did you go to gain such bounty?" her mother asked.
  

  
"Deep in the heart of the cold, where Our Lord of Ice and Stasis makes his home," the girl with diamonds in her hair said.
  

  
Their mother was delighted. Diamonds were rare, but a girl as quiet and perfect as Grace was now was a treasure indeed. She sent her younger daughter off too, to serve the Winter King and gain similar riches.
  

  
But Mal knew better. The girl who had come back to them was ice all the way through. This wasn't her sister. This was an ice sculpture the Winter King had sent back in her place. 
  

  
She set off to find her sister. Winter set in again on her travels. She came across the mouse and its children and took them with her, swearing to deliver them to warmer climes. She brought no weapon and so her hopeless wish brought her to the ice palace.
  

  
Her sister met her at the flickering threshold.
  

  
"Come home with me," she said. Grace's cheeks were tinged blue and her eyelashes covered with frost, but it was her. "I miss you."
  

  
Grace only smiled. "Does mother miss me?"
  

  
They'd promised a long time ago to never to lie to each other, and now she couldn't answer. 
  

  
"Be happy," her sister said. "I have everything I want."
  

  
"I wish I could convince you," Mal said, but she had promised a mouse warmer climes and her fire would only keep them safe for so long. 
  

  
She turned her back on the palace and walked out of the cold. She found the warmer place she promised the mouse and stayed there with it. She was done with winter.
  

  
And they all lived happily to the end of their days.
