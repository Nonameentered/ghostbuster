"I shouldn't be here," Alina said. Her protests were pointless. The listless men and women in this room were just as trapped as she was, and the man in the hooded robe was responsible for all of it. But she still had to speak.

"There's been some mistake," she insisted. 

"The Archons do not err," the man in the hooded robe replied. "You have been judged, and you have been found guilty. Accept your correction with grace."

She fell silent, like everyone else in the room had.  

She didn't know what she had done. She doubted anyone else in the room knew either. Most likely, they were simply woken in the middle of the night and told to comply. Questions went unanswered. Pleas and insults were ignored or simply talked over. In the end, silence was the path of least resistance. 

Then again, she was never very good at talking to other people anyway. She preferred speaking to her ancestors, as well as the spirits of the rain and fields. They always had something to say if you knew how to listen. Then the stars came to Daendalis and now she couldn't hear them anymore. Or had she simply forgotten how to listen to them?

But now the Archon Saiph was here, hair and eyes like bright blue fire. Everyone fell to their knees. It was better to do it yourself lest she decided to assist you with her bow. 

 A star from the heavens here to set everything to rights. It sounded wonderful until you were what needed to be set to rights. 

"I have decided on your fate," Saiph said. 

The doors swung open. Alina gasped. Beyond them was a forest she knew well. She had spent many happy hours there as a child clambering over rock formations, negotiating the thick undergrowth.

A wild hope rose up in her. She could make a break for it. Maybe she'd live for a few seconds more before they shot her. It was better than dying right away. 

"Trial by ordeal," Saiph continued. "That's your name for it, I suppose. My arrows seek out the guilty. If you can make it to the other side of this expanse without being hit even once, you'll be free to return home."

"That's it?" a man said. "That's all we have to do?" 

Saiph rounded on him, blue eyes wide and blazing. 

"I will not be spoken to in that way by the likes of *you!*" she snarled. 

She must have drawn her bow at some point, but no one noticed until the shining arrow was already buried in his throat. 

For all that, Alina was only surprised that there was so little blood.  

The living star notched another arrow. 

"Run," she said, and they scrambled to obey.
