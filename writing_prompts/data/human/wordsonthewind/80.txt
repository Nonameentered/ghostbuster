As the first raindrops fell, I thought, *at least I'll die standing.* 
  

  
They agreed not to tie me up. A meaningless concession on their part. Bound or not, the rising tide will cut me off from the shore. Then the sea will wash over this rocky outcrop and drag me under. The spray soaking my dress now is only the prelude to this fate. 
  

  
Three parts of my life, defined by land, sea, and sky. The poetry of it is more appealing than my imminent drowning. 
  

  
I used to be an albatross. Born in the air, I soared above thunder and rain. Ships followed whenever they glimpsed me in flight, seeking the stillness I effortlessly inhabited.
  

  
My lover's ship was one of those. HIs village clung to its rocky coast like so many barnacles, and their only way to make a living was to venture out to sea. The oceans held plenty of fish and stranger creatures besides. This was how he made his living. 
  

  
He was a dashing sea captain back then, charming and brave. My heart was light and capricious as the winds and I followed it right Into his arms. Then he burned the feathered cloak that held my wings and took me back home as his bride. 
  

  
Life on land with him wasn't as stable as he liked to imagine. His village, which had always seemed steady as the rocks to him, had cracks and fissures which only existed for me. No matter how I tried to play the good wife and mother, it was never quite enough. My children were happy enough with the pastor's wife, at least. 
  

  
The accusations of witchcraft didn't surprise me. I could hardly deny consorting with spirits when I used to be one myself. With a bad fishing season on top of that, the village needed a sacrifice to cleanse their sins. I didn't resist. Out on my rocky outcrop I could at least see the sky I had forsaken one last time as the gray clouds rolled in. 
  

  
It reached me then. The calm at the heart of the wind and rain.
  

  
Feathers pushed out of my back, my arms. My arms became wings once more. 
  

  
Had I really believed his lies? That I had a body? That I was my body?
  

  
"I'm an albatross," I said. "I was always an albatross. I just needed reminding."
  

  
Y*ou'll remember that*, the peaceful center around me replied. *Now and forever.*
  

  
And together we rose above the wind and the waves, above the clouds, and I left my life on land behind forever.
