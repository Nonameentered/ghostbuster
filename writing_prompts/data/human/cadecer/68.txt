"Hero. My name be Hero," said the ragged child with the chipped "holy" sword in her hands. "Y-yer human."

"Haven't you heard? No. I suppose not. What gave me away?"

"No horns," she said, in a thick Brecian accent. "And yer not red. You sort of be lookin' like uncle Jral. 'Cept for the sword. Uncle Jral don't be ownin' no sword."

I raised Fatenight and released my grip. The enchanted blade fell and turned to smoke before hitting the polished stone floor. I stifled a groan as I sat on my throne and poured myself a goblet of wine from the decanter to my left.

"You've done well to make it this far," I told her. "But you can barely stand. Why not stop?"

I took a sip of the spice wine. 

"No," she said, and raised her chipped sword. "I won't be dissuaded, fiend.  I know my purpose."

"Child," I said. "Your purpose is not to die on my throne room floor. No matter what tale that wizard has fed you, I assure you, there is more to life than death. Do you not have dreams? Ambitions?"

"Enough," she spat. "Ready yerself, for nigh is the hour and yer end has come. For the realm!"

The girl charged my throne, and I did not move. When she stabbed for my heart, the poorly-forged blade shattered like glass against my silk shirt. For a moment, she stood there wide-eyed, holding half a sword. 

I gently lowered her trembling hands and said, "Are you hungry? You're nothing but vigor and bones. When is the last time you ate?"

"I--" She dropped her arms to her sides, her face a portrait of disappointment. She looked so young then. "I have not eaten since Second Fair."

"Four days? That's a long time."

I snapped my fingers and two hooded Fatesworn entered through the service doors, pushing trays with roasted chicken, cold water, assorted fruit, fresh-baked bread, and a wheel of Strazian cheddar -- a meal fit for a starving hero. 

"S'ppose dying from poison not be a bad way to go. At least my belly be full."

I plucked an apple from the spread, took a bite, and chewed slowly. "Not poisoned, see? Please, eat your fill. There's plenty more."

"Ah! I no be understandin' ya," she shouted, snatching a chicken leg from the platter. "You be the Demon Lord. Fiend of fiends. Scourge of the realm. Yet here I be, breaking bread with ya. This no be like what Ildor said. Not at all."

"No, I suppose not," I said. "There is much you do not know about me or Ildor. For example -- just because I am the 'Demon Lord', does not mean I'm above showing hospitality to my guests."

"That's where ye be wrong," she said. "I no be yer guest, Demon. Do not forget, I be knowin' my purpose."

"Of course," I said. "How's the food?"

She told me that the food was the most delicious she'd ever tasted.

I asked her how long had it been since she left her village. I asked her about her family, her Uncle Jral, and she told me that her family was gone. That my Fatesworn had apparently purged her village in search for her. And because of that, she'd vowed to end my life.

I asked her if she liked dessert, and when she said that she did, I summoned my attendants once more and they set out little red cakes topped with snow berries. 

I bit into the cake, savoring the custard filling, and watched as she did the same. The cake sparked an idea.

"There is a baker not far from here," I said, arching an eyebrow. "The best. Have you ever tried your hand at baking? Some call it a craft, but what comes out of Gastuv's oven can only be called art. It's hard work, mind you, but I believe all worthwhile endeavors require a bit of sweat."

"No thanks," she said, still chewing on her second cake. "I still be plannin' on slaying ya."

I chuckled. "Very well. Then how about a spar?"

She brightened at this.

We went out to the training field in the heart of my keep. We took up wooden training sword and went through the seven stances, striking and defending, ebb and flow. Her form was rough, but had potential. Perhaps in a few decades she could make me break a sweat.

We rested on benches, shaded from the afternoon sun. I told Hero about my rivalry with Ildor and how our master would pit us against each other, mostly for her entertainment. I told her of the bad-old-days, back when real demons walked the realm, razing entire cities and collecting human souls for their foul magics. 

She told me of her home, Hearthglen, of the day Ildor rode his cart into their sleepy hamlet, and how he decreed that one among them was destined to defeat the Demon Lord. She told me of her work as a weaver, making shirts mostly and tapestries -- but only under her aunt's guidance. She told me how she'd denied Ildor's proclamation that she was the fated hero. And how that night, she awoke to half the village slaughtered and standing over her bed was Ildor, urging her to flee with him for her safety.

The training grounds started to rumble, and I tamped down my fury. She jumped up and pointed her training sword at me.

"I apologize," I told her. "I did not mean to frighten you. I understand your reasons for taking up the sword. More than you'd think. But know that I do not relish this -- I am not the monster here."

"Then who? I be knowin' my purpose, and it be to defeat you," she said.

"Come with me," I said. "I'd like to show you something."

I lead her down to the catacombs and the Shrine To the Fallen.

"Swords," she said, more to herself it seemed. "So many swords."

"Yes."

"What is this?"

"It is where I have buried the remains of the chosen." I pointed to a brilliant sword stabbed into a rock. It shined despite the dim torchlight. "That is Grace, sword of the first hero. He was deserving of it. Strongest of them all."

"And you killed him?"

"Yes. Despite his grievous wounds, he would not relent. Vengeance drives us to commit horrible acts, you see. Pushes us beyond our limits."

She stepped closer to the sword, ran her fingers down the side of the silver-white blade, and after a moment said, "His family. They was killed too?"

"Yes."

"Was it you?"

"No."

She fell to her knees. Her sobs echoed through the cramped corridors and my heart twisted and wretched, trying to burst out of my chest. 

"It is his way," I said, finally. "It is how he pulls you into his cause. Younger and younger each time. I'm sorry."

"What now? What of me?"

I thought for a moment, then said, "Now, we have dinner."   
After dinner, I smoked a pipe and served us blue tea. She spent the night in one of my guest quarters, the door heavily barred per her request.

It was not that she was stubborn. It was that Hero had lost everything she'd ever known, had not had a chance to grieve. The "quest" took up everything in her life, became her life. I kept my distance, only sending servants to bring her food. Some nights, I could hear her crying from my chambers. Eventually, she'd come out and request to spar with me. I obliged.

After a month, she stopped barring her door, and asked if I would teach her how to defend against magic. "Of course," I said.

I watched her fight one of my lieutenants this morning. My heart swelled with pride at the sight of her deflecting his eldritch bolts, cutting through his gusts, drowning his flames with nothing but a training sword -- and hard-earned skill. Victorious, she jogged over to me, wiped her brow, and smiled.

"How be that?" she asked. "You think I be ready, Master?"

I thought for a moment, then held out my hand to the side. Fatenight appeared from smoke and fell into my grip. I turned the hilt toward Hero and presented her my sword.

"With this." I smiled down at her. "You can finally fulfill your purpose."
