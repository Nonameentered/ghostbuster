Let it be known that the world didn't end with a bang or a whimper … but with a thrum.

My name is Gos Mirodrin and I'm a member of the Ingport Explorer's Guild. My assignment was to find and recover a functional mana core. According to the arcanists, if you managed to reach deep enough into the Iron End Labyrinth, you'd find still-functioning cores. An inert core, like those recovered from the outer levels, produced enough ambient energy to power every crystal lamp in a city. A functional one? It could power a nation.

Labyrinths come in all shapes and sizes. The Elder Wood Labyrinth, made entirely of giant Adama Trees, seems to have grown organically in the heart of the Rhuinar Forest. The Brine Reach Labyrinth is a sprawling temple to a forgotten god at the bottom of the Sea of Storms. Over the centuries, the Explorer's Guild managed to map out most labyrinths, reclaiming any lost artifacts (and most of the treasure -- nothing wrong with a little finder's fee). But one remains unexplored.

The skelimen inhabiting the upper levels of the Iron End Labyrinth did not see or smell their targets. You needed eyes and a nose for that. Instead, they sensed by touch. Vibrations. And the metal corridors were excellent conductors.

The levitation crystal attached to my belt only worked for as long as I held by breath. By the time my lungs burned and the urge to breathe had me twitching, I was hovering above three of the skeletal soldiers, each armed with rusted swords or axes. 

It wasn't that I couldn't handle a couple of skelimen. They were as tough as a koblin. But if I was going to make it all the way to the heart of Iron End, I couldn't burn my  stamina on small fry. And carrying all the extra weight in my backpack burned my breath faster than normal. It was a fine mess I was in.

The red crystal lights sticking out of the walls flickered, and I gasped like a fish in a tree. The levitation spell cut off. I dropped in the middle of the group, pulled my short blade from behind my back, and spun around, taking off two of the three heads. The third skeliman swung its sword in a lazy arc. I parried the strike and countered with a blow to the neck.

The skelimen rattled and collapsed into piles of bones and rust. The clatter carried down both ends of the corridor. It didn't take long before skeletal foot steps clanged their way louder and closer toward me. 

I filled my lungs with air a couple of times before taking another long, deep breathe and holding it. There must have been at least thirty skelimen searching where I stood as I floated deeper into the labyrinth, counting the seconds.

The second layer of the labyrinth is where most of the Explorer's Guild work had been focused. There were no skelimen, no koblins. No life at all. But traps? Oh, that it had plenty. My mentor, Jungan Seven Lives was the first explorer to ever reach the second layer of tunnels and corridors. He was also the first to discover the traps … with his face. They built a statue in his honor outside the guildhall. 

The only signs that you'd made it from the first to the second layer was that there were no more monsters and a sign painted on the wall reading: JUNGAN'S END. The corridors remained identical. A perfectly smooth metal floor, segmented every ten paces, with red crystal lights lining the walls evenly. The lights bathed everything in a bloody-red glow. The air grew staler and warmer the deeper you went.   

I won't lie. I was shaking as bad as a headless skelinman. What I was about to try hadn't been tested, only theorized by the know-it-all arcanists in the safety of their laboratories. I was wearing mostly leather, a light cloak, and a backpack filled with supplies. The manabolts fired by the traps ahead could and would shred me to ribbons -- like Jungan.

But the Prime of Lenomere came to me with this assignment. Me. She said she'd been impressed with my success reaching the heart of the Elder Wood Labyrinth. But the look in her eye wasn't amazement. It was desperation. 

That was why she gave the arcanists Ingport City's only labyrinth core. The street lights were dark as they worked on their "solution." And after a month, they claimed to have succeeded. The problem was, manabolts strong enough to test their contraption could *only* be found in the second layer of the Iron End Labyrinth. And they sure as hell weren't coming down here. So, it fell on me. 

I set my backpack down and opened the flap. The switch on the device built around the core had a little sign drawn above it in big letters. UP ON, DOWN OFF. Did they think I was an idiot? I flipped the switch and the core didn't do anything. They'd said that'd be the case. That I'd know it was working after the first blast. 

I grumbled as I slung my pack back onto my back. Felt too much like relying on faith. Hadn't they heard? The gods were dead. You want something done, you had to do it yourself.

I pressed my palm against the wall with the sign reading JUNGAN'S END. "Okay, old man," I said to myself. "I ain't going home. I'm going deep."

I ran.

The crystal lamps along the walls started blinking. I didn't slow down one bit. The rigged-up core bounced against my back with every step. After a couple of seconds, the lights stopped blinking. They went out, drenching the corridor in darkness.

Then one of the lights started glowing white, brighter and brighter. The air crackled around the light until it screeched like quenching a red-hot piece of iron. A bar of white light as thick as an oar fired at me. A manabolt. 

It should have cut right through me, left a smoking hole where my head or heart was. Instead, the core on my back whined as the bolt spread over a sphere of invisible energy surrounding me. The arcanist theory worked.

"Hot damn you beautiful bastards!" I shouted, still running.

More and more bolts fired, all of them washing over as if I were sitting under a waterfall. But not a single drop of light reached me. Eventually, I stopped to catch my breath. The bolts continued raining down on me from all angles and the core kept absorbing them. The arcanists claimed the core could absorb indefinitely. I didn't know about that, but I was looking to test their theory. As soon as I caught my breath, I kept at it. Even with the extra weight, my stamina was tip-top. That was something Jungan taught me early on. Explorers need to be able to run. So I did.

Eventually, the manabolts stopped. The corridor ended in facing a massive metal door. The frame was dotted with crystal lights softly glowing blue. This was uncharted territory. I had my lockpicking tools but that required a lock. The door was smooth, no slots or holes. 

Swallowing hard, I padded forward and pressed my hand against the metal. And it opened. 

The door rumbled and slowly groaned up into the ceiling, revealing a chamber. I pulled my sword and entered. Inside, the chamber had a domed ceiling like a temple and crystal lights dotted the walls evenly, though the glowed low and blue. The air was staler than month old bread. And there were chairs.

Several chairs all arranged in a circle around a platform. And on the platform sat a massive crystal. If it was a labyrinth core, it was at least ten times the size of the one strapped to my back. 

Suddenly, the crystal lights turned bright, illuminating the entire chamber. A voice started speaking in a strange language. 

"What?" I said.

It spoke again, this time every other word coming through. I didn't say anything. I wasn't sure if I was talking to some imprisoned god or spirit.  

Finally, the voice spoke once more and this time it was perfectly understandable. "Welcome back," it said. "Ship exiting standby mode."

The floor thrummed beneath my feet and the voice suggested I strap myself into a "crash couch." I didn't dare move an inch. Whatever was happening, it was reacting to me. But maybe it wasn't. Maybe all it needed was an excuse to start up trouble? 

An image flickered to life over the crystal on the platform. It was a translucent map of Lenomere. And blinking toward it was a red dot the size of a city. 

The chamber walls turned clear as if turned to glass. Around me was sky. Nothing but blue sky and clouds zipping past. 

"Stop!" I shouted. "What's happening?"

The voice said, "Executing last order. Destroy."
