As he thumbtacked the laminated meeting sign outside of the church basement door, Marty started reciting the serenity prayer to himself again. It wasn't a physical craving that had him feeling ready to rip the wrong person's head off. It was something deeper, older, rooted in the base of his being. The *ism*. But tonight, like every Tuesday night at 11:30 PM, he showed up for his recovery. And that's all that mattered. 

But the "Bloodied Deacons" support group could not keep going with Marty running everything by himself. He may have founded the meeting, but experience taught Marty that if the group has any hope of longevity, it starts with him giving up control. Which means the other members need to fill the three rolls Marty has been performing since he started the meeting over a year ago. Marty started the serenity prayer over again. All he could do was try.

Marty took his place at the twelve o'clock position in the circle of folding chairs he'd set up in the meeting space. Faded floral print wallpaper stretched around the basement, and paint chips curled down from the low ceiling, like fat snowflakes waiting to fall. Despite the October chill leaking through the windows, the air conditioners all thrummed at max cool. Henry thumbed open the binder with a laminated copy of the meeting script and closed his eyes.

Marty smelled Julio's cologne long before the man seeped into the basement as a silvery mist. Eyes open, Marty watched as the mist coalesced into a gray-haired man wearing a black Knicks jersey and a black Yankee's fitted cap. Julio took his seat, opposite Marty, and started scrolling through his phone.

The rest of the "Bloodied Deacons" arrived in the usual order. Sophia, a twenty-something-looking Italian woman, strut through the red double doors (which opened for her automatically); Greg, a suit-wearing finance bro, swarmed into the room as a flock of bats and sat one spot away from Sophia; Chris rose from one of the folding chair's shadows, like riding up on an elevator in a blue button down and skin tight black slacks, and talked loudly on the phone as he plopped down in a chair. Esmeralda, an Ecuadorian food vendor, came out of the bathroom whistling and joined the meeting; on and on, until all but one of the twelve folding chairs were filled. 

Marty glanced up at the white clock on the wall, the kind you'd see in a class room, and followed the second hand as it made its laps around and around the face of the clock until striking midnight. Then, Marty read from the script.

"Welcome, everyone, to our meeting of the Bloodied Deacons. My name is Marty and I'm a vampire."

"Hi, Marty," droned the room. 

Marty smiled at the laminated script and continued, "We meet to heal from the effects of vampirism by sharing our experience, strength, and hope with each other..."

After reading from the Little Red Book, an improvised recovery manual Marty cobbled together using materials from his narcotics recovery program and personal stories shared by vampires in recovery on forums and blogs, the floor opened to shares.

Julio launched into a story about wanting to bite a college student's neck while he watched him from across the dance floor at a night club. As Julio explained, in great detail, the throbbing hunger that tugged him closer and closer to the student, one of the double doors creaked opened and everyone whipped around almost in unison.

If Marty had a pulse, it would have been racing. It wasn't strange for a newcomer to walk into a meeting halfway. But the Bloodied Deacons wasn't just any meeting. The only requirement for membership was vampirism. The meeting was a safe place for members to freely explore the effects of vampirism, namely the hunger. So if a human were to wander in during a particularly emotionally vulnerable moment, Marty wasn't sure he could stop another vampire from pouncing on them, let alone himself. 

So when the human (and she was human, reeking of sweat and meat and wariness) glanced around at eleven fanged faces, some of them hissing at her, all wide-eyed and bewildered, Marty streaked toward her at inhuman speed and stopped halfway.

Standing in the middle of the circle of folding chairs, Marty watched, mouth agape, as Esmeralda held Greg pinned under her diminutive form, knee on neck. Julio, not one to slouch, held Sophia in a full-Nelson as she thrashed and struggled to break free. But what stopped Marty dead in his tracks was the human. Maybe in her early twenties, black hair down to her shoulder in a leather jacket and torn jeans, the human had Chris in a wrist lock, working his outstretched arm like an oar as she directed him gently to the floor.

The rest of the members—the old-timers—vampires who'd lived over a century and who worked to not feed on humans—simply sat and watched in silence. 

"You gonna behave, Lestat, or am I going home with a brand new arm?" the human woman asked Chris. Chris hissed at her and when he tried twisted around, the woman yanked his arm and pinned his face right against the scuffed up floor tiles. Julio cheered her on and Esmeralda shook her head like a disappointed nun. 

Marty shook off the shock and slowly walked over to the human woman, saying, "I'll take it from here, miss...?"

"Nora."

"Nora," said Marty, realizing there's no way a human could be strong enough to restrain Chris, let alone any vampire. Now closer, Marty could make out the faint red outline of Nora's   carotid artery pulsing through her neck. Definitely human. "I'm sorry about my friend here."

"I'm not your fucking friend," muttered Chris, his words muffled by the linoleum pressed against his face. 

"I'm sorry about *Chris*," Marty corrected. "I'll take it from here."

She eyed Marty warily for a moment then half-shrugged, offering him Chris' captive wrist.
