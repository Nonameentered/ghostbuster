North of the Shifting Wood stood the first city built on the ridge between civilization and the southern wilds. Basil Easton patrolled the city of Castros' southern gate from sun up to sun down eight days a week. A gate that his mother had guarded and his grandfather before her as did every first-born in the Easton family. More than duty, it was tradition for Basil Easton to don the garrison blue. In the days of Basil's grandfather there were many battles between the city garrison and the horrors that crawled out of from the Shifting Wood's twisted tree line; in the days of his mother not so many; and now there were so few that Basil didn't bother oiling his short sword, since it seemed the greatest threat to Castros' southern gate was a particularly stiff wind.

The Shifting Wood once hosted horrors that walked the world and cast long shadows; beings from the Daemon realms where the sun burned black and putrid odors lingered about dragon carcasses and charnel pits the size of villages. The Edge Lords of the Daemon realms had launched hundreds of assaults against Castros' southern gate but never successfully penetrated its miraculous walls or bested the men and women of the city's garrison, according to Basil's grandfather who in turn told Basil's mother, and his mother told him in the cold winter nights when the wind howled hungrily from the south. Basil, of course, had read more of such accounts, and of many things otherwise, in the books his mother gifted him when he was young and yearned for adventure. To end the Edge Lords all by himself. 

But better than the stories of old men and the stories of books were the stories of the Shifting Wood itself. Endless, ancient, blooming, decaying, or as still as death; Writhing, reaching, hunting; that forest was alive. All of Basil's years spent alone at his post watching and listening and studying had prepared his mind. At first it whispered to Basil only the simplest of tales. Stories of seeds growing into saplings and maturing into trees; eventually, the Shifting Wood grew more trusting and whispered of graver things; of things more strange and warning in nature. Sometimes at twilight the thick mists that poured out from the looming tree line parted to show Basil glimpses of paths leading deep into the woods; and sometimes at night the mists gave way altogether and the trees seemed to pull at him. And this pull remained with him, even on the nights he locked himself in his bedroom; for the Shifting Wood was more ancient than man and its reach feared no walls or torches or logic.

But out of the Shifting Wood the White Wolf came too. A majestic demigod that emerged from the cursed forest when the moon hung full in the night sky. Loping out of the Shifting Wood it glided across the meadowlands to Castros. And whether the garrison patrolled or not, and whether the watch braziers burned bright or dull, its sleek white form loped unnoticed through the gate and into the city proper. One night Basil watched the massive creature run by from his bedroom window, and it seemed to beckon him to head south. Many times afterward he saw the White Wolf under the full moon; it always whispered to him.

The moon shined full and bright and red on the night Basil Easton accepted the invitation. He marched out beyond the southern gate to the Shifting Wood following a trail of moonlight. The White Wolf that had invited him loped beside him, whispering a welcome in a wild language Basil now seemed to speak as well, and the mists gave way before their procession of two, everything soaked red under the glow of that full, crimson moon. It was called the Traveller's Moon by some who followed the old ways. Basil only followed his curiosity, and a demigod apparently.

When dawn broke over the trees, purple bleeding into black, Basil reached the other end of the Shifting Wood. The path had been fairly straightforward but he covered such a great distance without stopping his run once all night, amazingly able to keep up with the loping wolf at his side. Whatever the reason, it was a minor detail compared to what stood before him.

Basil dropped to his knees before the row of ancient treants that marked the end of the Shifting Wood, their oaken faces gnarled and wise, and to him unreal. The White Wolf offered its muzzle and Basil petted the creatures snout until his legs regained their composure. He'd spent a shameful amount of time imagining what he would do if he ever met treants and embarrassingly added collapsing to the top of his list. 

As Basil rose, the White Wolf whispered of the land beyond the treant sentries. "The land of Nod," he said, "where the dreams and thoughts that come to mortals are born and return to die." 

The treants nor the White Wolf stopped Basil from peaking out beyond the tree line. He saw that what the Wolf had said was true, for among the sights before him were many things he had imagined after reading a particularly fantastical book or from one of his grandfather's journals. There too were beings and entities more magnificent than any he had ever known; visions of gleaming towers rising above cities made of glass, great iron birds flying through the sky, and all the knowledge of the world condensed into little glowing squares. But Basil did not set foot upon the rolling hills of Nod. "Any who runs in the Dreamlands may never return to hearth-home," the White Wolf had warned. Basil obeyed.

As the White Wolfe loped silently away from the rolling hills of Nod, a roar like mountains screaming echoed through the trees, shaking them to the roots. It came from the east; once the roar died down, the great wolf said to him, "That is Ashakong, the Guardian of the Under Path. We must travel the Path to reach our destination." Another roar. Basil covered his ears again and still heard the rage in the creatures incredible roar. Surly this Ashakong must tower over humans, large enough to tear them in two with nothing but a gesture.

Basil then did what he had not done in over a decade. He oiled his sword. "Few have made it past the Guardian of the Under Path. Some say the Guardian is a mercy, for within the Path walk only Daemons and mad things that are no longer men, and the way is white with unburied bones of those who have gazed upon the Filo Domani that walk the Path." 

There were more reasons in what the White Wolf said to turn back than words. But to the moment he entered the Shifting Wood, Basil had considered his life forfeit. No, the moment he accepted the Wolf's invitation. There was nothing left for him back in Castros. But he could end the Daemon threat once and for all. If it cost him his life, a price worth paying. So the White Wolf led him east along the tree line toward the terrible roars of the Guardian.

Basil and the White Wolf followed the air-splitting roar until he had to pack bandage cotton into both of their ears. Fighting through the roars they came to an expansive grove with blossoms of every hue, where radiant arbors soaked in the autumns sun. Here the roars no longer seemed to reach their ears. Basil slowly removed their cotton plugs and counted the seconds but still no roar came. 

From bowers beyond their view came bursts of song and snatches of conversation, interspersed with rich laughter so savory that Basil was halfway toward the edge of the grove before realizing his feet were moving. The White Wolf said nothing, only watched Basil as they both reached the tree line. Suddenly a wind blowing from beyond the fruit-burdened trees before them carried a scent that doubled Basil over, heaving up spit. The wind grew stiffer, and the air was choked with the putrid, charnel odor of plague-stricken villages and unserviced latrines. As Basil scrambled away from the edge of the grove the White Wolf spoke at last, saying, "That way is Xura, the Land of Pleasure Unattained."

Basil could only laugh at how close he came to losing his life. There was nothing to it. Caution was his religion. "Lead on, wolf," he said. 

So once more the White Wolf loped ahead through a path of shifting trees, constantly turning and twisting and following the roars that had resumed once they'd safely left the grove. Day after day and night after night they ran, and when the moon was full once more they would hunt great boar, massive hunks of shoulder and flanks roasted over a bonfire. In addition to the cotton in their ears, they'd learned to ignore the roars enough to sleep. It was by moonlight too that they reached the cave of Sona-Nyl, which was guarded by a dragon as large as an inn. This was the Guardian of the Under Path, so with all proper respect, Basil drew his short sword and hid behind a boulder.
