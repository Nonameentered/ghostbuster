Organ music cried out a sad song from within the church. 

"Yes ... of course they'd play a dirge. How could you not faced with the prospects of marrying that twig of a man."

Trembling with anger, I started mentally preparing for the pain.

Before me stood the marble church in the heart of Gravenbrook. There were two churches in the city, but Lord Twig followed the Graceborn faith, so here he'd be.

And her.

"I'm coming, Yana."

I shoved open the doors. The music stopped. The priest stood over a pair of people kneeling before him, all of them wearing black. 

The moment I stepped past the threshold, my skin started smoking.

"I OBJECT!"

Every head in the church turned to face me. Most of them were crying. The priest pointed his scepter my way. 

"Young man, what do you think you're doing!"

"This wedding is a sham! Yana doesn't love him. She loves me and I love her. I'm here to put a stop to it and no one is getting in my way. That means you, mongo."

A bear of a man stuffed into a black jacket and breeches stopped dead in his tracks. I pointed at him, keeping my finger steady through the pain.

"Young man," the priest bellowed. "That is all very well and good, but this is not a wedding."

Not a wedding? Then what ...?

The bear-man took another step closer. His eyes were read and puffy. Like he'd been ... crying. Yes. Lots of people were crying. And wearing black. And...

The two people who'd been kneeling before the priest turned from the casket and glowered in my direction. Not Yana and Lord Twig. 

"Oh, oh..."

Two churches! My finger, still pointed at the bear-man, burst into flames. 

Someone screamed. It was the priest, howling as he backed away from the casket.

The deceased, no longer ceased, rose from her casket. She was winter pale, devoid of life, but her eyes flared green from the necromantic power coursing through her cold veins. 

"Kill her!" Shouted one of the people at the front of the church. They must have been her family. "She's been possessed! Kill her!"

There was no time for this!

I ran back outside and jumped the steps to the paved street. The impact shot up from my boots to my shoulders, but that was nothing compared to the divine smiting delivered inside the church. 

But I wasn't the only one. In a pocket of awareness in the back of my mind, I felt her pain too. Her pain and confusion and fear. 

Raised without warning during one's own funeral... What was I, an amateur?

I sighed, knowing I'd regret this decision, and issued a command to my new minion. One word sent from my mind to her.

*Follow.*

The revenant squealed in delight as she burst out of the church, breaking one of the massive doors right off the hinge, and landed lithely beside me. Her black burial dress was still smoking.

"What is your name?"

Her face scrunched up. "It ... was Cora." She brightened. "But I'm flexible."

She must have been in her early twenties. A tragic death it seemed. Perhaps that was why she was so calm about her resurrection. Normally they scream much more.

"Very well, Cora" I said, turning toward the other church. "You will aid me in my task and once complete, I shall release your soul from my service."

It was only fair. How was he supposed to know they be at the *other* church!

"I don't know — there's a lot I need to do and I don't want to waste any time. I've gotta book a carriage to Westmarch. You know how long it takes to book one of those?"

I turned slowly, trying to keep my face as level and serene as possible.

"You okay?" she asked. "You're really red."

Serene...

"Only a few moments ago you were dead. Deceased. From *is* to *was*. What could you possibly have to do now?"

She clapped her hands and smiled like a child seeing fireworks for the first time. 

"I'm going to see the *world*!"

What sort of minion was this! See the world? Was she even under my command?

"I don't have time for this. Just follow me and do as I say."

I started running east toward the other church. But there wasn't a second set of footsteps tapping against the pavement. I stopped and glanced over my shoulder.

Cora was in line at the carriage authority!

Fine. If that's how she wanted to play, then she won't mind a will-breaking command from her master.

*Follow...*

*No thanks!*

WHAT? That wasn't possible. She'd followed me outside of the church. 

*Follow!*

*I can't*! *I'll lose my place in line.*

How was she resisting my commands? Well, it wasn't a proper resurrection. In all likelihood, the priest was performing her last rights when I burst in and objected to the prayer. That could work as a command to rise. Add to that using necromancy on consecrated ground and it's a miracle she even rose at all. Honest'y, it's quite fascinating—

"What am I doing! I've need to save Yana!"

I'd deal with the revenant later. I started running toward the other church.

"Good luck, master!" Cora shouted at me from the line.

Fascinating indeed.
