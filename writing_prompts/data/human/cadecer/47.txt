"There's something strange about you..." Henry said. "Why are you wearing crocs?"

"Really?" I said. "You understand that I'm covered in blood, right?"

Head to toe. My oversized *Sunshine Dental* sweatshirt dripped blood on the faux-hardwood floor of our apartment. So did my scrub bottoms and my hands and every part of me that faced the vampire I'd staked in an alley less than an hour ago. There was no hiding the truth from Henry anymore. 

He pointed at my feet.

"Not important, explain the crocs!"

"Henry. I haven't been completely honest with you." I dropped onto the couch, the back of my "outfit" mercifully dry. "I...I'm not really a dental hygienist. Well, I am — I know how to do the job — but I don't deal with teeth, per se. I deal with fangs." I sucked in a quick breath and blew it out. "Henry, I hunt vam—"

"Hold on," he said, sitting beside me, but not too close. "I'm not gonna pretend to understand the nuances of dentistry. Teeth, fangs, molars, whatever. That's your world, not mine. But you? I know you, Billy. You'd rather die than wear crocs. What happened?"

"Broke my heels fighting off an ... attacker," I said, stunned. Didn't he see the blood? "Had to borrow shoes from work."

He nodded, seemingly satisfied, and reached for my hand. I pulled it back, still bloody. He grabbed it anyway.

"I think you need to take some time off work," he said.

"Not this again," I said, getting up. "I'm taking a shower."

\*\*\*

I wrapped up my hair dry in a micro-fiber towel embroidered with *Billy* along the bottom. Henry's towel hung on the rack, his name there too. The vent hummed overhead, sucking away all the steam after a long, hot, and much-needed shower. It didn't loosen the knots in my shoulders.

My phone buzzed against the bathroom countertop. It was Doctor Dan.

"I've got the union head up my ass over that illegal extermination, Willamina," Doctor Dan's meaty voice beefed over speakerphone. No point "going for a walk" to take his calls anymore. Henry would know the truth soon enough. "What the hell happened!"

"Did you know," I told him, "that most vampires attack people without filling out the appropriate forms? Happens all the time, actually."

The silence on the phone stretched long enough for me to start applying face cream. Then he said, "Get your ass down to the office and fill out this incident report. Now, *Hunter* Shaw. And when you're done — you're suspended. For a month."

I glowered down at the phone. But the heat in my cheeks told me I deserved it.

Still, when was the last time I went on vacation?

\*\*\*

Henry wasn't resting or relaxing. I was organizing my sun dresses in the hotel room closet. He was watching the news, where this wild-haired pundit with a face like a knuckle spouted on and on about the murder spike in big cities across the country.

"We should move to Rhode Island," he said. "This doesn't happen in Rhode Island."

"Of course it does," I said. "Just not on such a large scale. More people means more crime, period."

"Exactly!" he shouted, though more out of excitement. "Less people, less chance of you getting mugged again."

"Babe, I *wasn't* mugged," I said, fingering through dresses. "I was attacked by a vampire—"

He turned off the TV. I heard him grab his stuff and pad towards the door. I stared at my dresses, worrying my bottom lip. 

"Will you please just listen to me," I said, but the door was already closing behind him.

What did I have to do — show him a vampire?

\*\*\*

I found one a few miles outside the resort, an adolescent in torn jeans and t-shirt, clawing at the remains of an old woman with that newly-turned vigor. Occasionally, he'd sniff the night air before returning to his meal.

This time I was doing the ambushing. Hopefully that meant I wouldn't ruin my Peter Som peony floral dress.

I looked at the bloody mess at his feet. Hopefully...

Guild rules didn't say squat about hunting vamps abroad. So long as I was fast and quiet, there'd be no chance for any local hunters to get involved. Maybe if his face wasn't caked with gore he would have smelled me sneaking up behind him. He certainly didn't hear me.

"Freeze, pendejo," I said, pressing the stake on his back where his heart would be. "You're coming with me."

The teen did freeze, and started speaking Spanish way too fast for me to keep up. I told him to keep quiet. That lead to a bunch of hissing and clicking, non-verbal communication amongst vamps, that I quickly ended with a solid thump to the back of the head. 

*This isn't work*, I reminded myself. *This is personal*.

\*\*\*

"You have to let him go," said Henry. "Right now."

He'd covered the tied up vamp with his beach towel and started pacing from the hotel bathroom to the TV and back. His anxiety march was in full force. What was the point of going on vacation if this was the result?

"You saw his fangs," I said. "You saw it, Henry. He doesn't leave this room alive. Well, he's already not alive—"

"Right," he said. "Now."

"Are you nuts?" I said. "He's a *vampire*, Henry! He eats people."

"I know!"

Henry stopped. Froze like a vamp with a stake against its heart, his mouth half open like he was about to say something.

He was.

"I know you're a hunter," he said. "I've known since we moved in together."

No. Not possible. I was careful. Paranoid, even. My cover was solid and I kept all of my gear in the office. Not a scrap of evidence to be found. But the look in his eyes ... so steady.

"How?" I asked. "How did you find out?"

"My sister is a dental hygienist, remember?" he said, and he smiled despite tears gathering in his eyes. What was all this about? "She doesn't work nearly as much as you, like at all. So, I decided to follow you one night, and..."

"You spied on me!"

He nodded.

"I can't—" I could have throttled him right then and there. But I didn't. "So, now what?" I asked.

"Let him go," he said. "And then we can talk."

\*\*\*

I did let the vampire go. Right into the hands of the *Casadores Federales*. Figured I'd let the locals handle their own. Henry and I did talk, a lot. I was pissed he'd known my secret this whole time and he wasn't pissed at all, which made arguing harder. Cheater.

When we finished not-arguing, we walked through the resort, taking in the sights and sounds. We weren't done talking; we just needed a break.

A vendor called out to us. He was selling resort-brand crocs. Henry stopped and tried on a pair. The vendor smiled and waggled a pair at me.

What the hell? I'm on vacation.
