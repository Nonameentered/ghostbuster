When emergency services arrived, Gerald joined Marta, the New City Community Center organizer, in explaining what had happened. One of the officers asked if Yugo had any next of kin or hard ID. Gerald and Marta blinked at each other. Hard ID? Apparently, Yugo wasn't inked. An illegal immigrant then.

Gerald handed over the metallic case to the officer and gave his number as a point of contact, in case Yugo didn't have any family to take care of burial services. He'd only known the man a little over two months, and was still scared of him — especially after watching his skull burn itself out — but who else was there?

Afterward, standing at the bus stop, Gerald scrolled through is social feed on his hand terminal, his eyes glazing over the only slightly cracked screen. Yugo had been a gearhead? At his age?

Someone tapped Gerald on the right shoulder and he nearly jumped out of his sneakers.

"Jesus, take it easy." It was Marissa. She had her pink cat-eared hoodie up and drawn, showing enough of her face that only someone who knew her would recognize her. "What did the cops say to you?"

"What?"

"The cops," Marissa repeated, rolling her eyes. "What did they say. To you."

"Nothing," Gerald said. "They just asked if Yugo had any next of kin. I don't think he did. Do you know if—"

Marissa clapped her hands right in front of Gerald's face and he nearly jumped out of his shoes again. The woman was going to give him a heart attack!

"Uh—no. I mean about Yugo being a freakin' gearhead!"

The other commuters either glanced over at Marissa or started scrolling through their hand terminals. None of their business ... or Geralds.

He leaned in close and pressed a finger over his lips.

"Shhh. Keep it down," he hissed. "We don't know that. And it's none of our business." He nodded to himself.

The M17 crosstown pulled up to the curb and hissed its doors open.

"This is me," Gerald said, and turned to embark.

"Yeah, I know." Marissa said. "We live on the same block."

"What?"

"On or off?" demanded the bus driver, if you could call him that. The buses drove themselves mostly. If anything, he was a bus conductor.

Gerald whipped his head between Marissa and the conductor in a double, triple take, and finally tapped his wrist against the scan terminal at the front of the bus before trudging to an empty seat. Marissa took the seat next to him and badgered him for eleven stops before following him down the block, around the corner, and up to his apartment building.

Gerald pressed his head against the building's front door for just a moment, just long enough to gather himself. His heart had been racing since the moment Marissa popped up behind him at the bus stop. She lived on the same block as him? So for two months they'd just been missing each other like ships in the night?

The street lights flickered on as the sun dipped below the rooftops.

"I'm not going anywhere till you tell me what's up," Marissa shouted behind Gerald. What did he have to do to get through to her? "You saw it, dude! A legit gearhead, in *our* baking class! What the—oh hell no!"

"Mister Paloma," said a man's voice.

Gerald, suddenly feeling very tired, turned and found the officer who'd taking his statement holding a gun to Marissa's head. Gerald froze.

"What is the combination?"

Gerald's mouth was a desert made of cotton balls and sponges. Combination? What combination?

"Asshole," Marissa said. "I'm pretty sure this shit is highly illegal so why don't you get that gun the hell away from me before you become a celebrity."

Marissa had her hand terminal pointed at the officer. An alert went off on Gerald's terminal, but when he reached for his pocket the officer pointed the gun at him.

"No sudden moves!"

"Like this!" Marissa shouted as she dipped beneath the officer, grabbing his out stretched arm, and flipping him over her back and smashing him down into the concrete with a heavy thud.

"Run!" she screamed, sprinting up to Gerald with the metallic case in her arms. "Inside, idiot!"

Gerald didn't think. He turned, tapped his wrist against the security screen, and nearly tripped as Marissa shoved past him into the apartment building.

"Where's your unit!"

Gerald grabbed Marissa's wrist and ran up the stairs, almost dragging her, to unit 2L.

Gerald hadn't had anyone over his new apartment yet. Despite having moved in over two months ago, some of his stuff was still boxed up and stacked in the living room. Which maybe was for the best considering the moment he closed the door, Gerald puked.
