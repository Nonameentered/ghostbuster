My gig that morning was to secure a half-a-million-dollar inheritance for an orange tabby named Peppermint, and it was the gig I was least looking forward to that day.

I sipped from my flask while seated in a circle drawn in liquid chalk in the middle of Saul Meyer's law office conference room floor in Williamsburg, relishing the burn of the cheap whiskey as it flowed into my stomach. I pushed play on my phone, and Metallica's *Master of Puppets* started blasting over my portable Bluetooth speaker. Across from me, Mr. Lapp was fuming like a teakettle. 

"This is crap, your honor, and you know it!" Mr. Lapp shouted over the music in his cheesecake-thick New York accent. His attorney was casually inspecting me. "I don't care what this witch doctor says. That money ain't going to no cat. You hear? I'll fight this tooth and nail."

The judge overseeing the arbitration said nothing. He'd settled these sorts of cases for Saul before and knew to give it time.

"Please be quiet," I said, closing my eyes and hopefully projecting an eerie mysticism. "I require concentration in order to pierce the Veil. Wait -- I feel her reaching out."

Actually, Ginnie Lapp had been hanging out with me since last night when I evoked her spirit. I wasn't a live performance type of necromancer. Really, I wouldn't call myself a necromancer at all. Shaman or medium was my preferred nomenclature, but necromancer has that edgy sort of feel that pulls customers looking to *actually* speak with the dead. In my line of business, marketing is everything. Saul Meyers understands that perfectly well. It's why he includes post-mortem arbitration clauses in his client's wills. So no matter what Mr. Lapp says, if Ginnie Lapp shows up to confirm her wishes, the suits have to respect the will. 

"Wait, what?" said Mr. Lapp. "I don't see her nowhere. This guy's faking!"

*I'm amazed my grandson can manage to speak so much*, Ginnie said, floating beside me. *Considering his head is so firmly up his ass.*

"The spirit is here with us," I said, stifling a chuckle. "She is ready for your questions."

Saul was seated at the left end of the long conference table. He flipped through paperwork, searching for the questionnaire, but it was all an act. Saul had just as much a flair for the dramatic as I did. He cleared his throat and read the first question.

"What is your name, date of birth, and birthplace?"

I gasped, rolled my eyes back, and held out my hands, palms up. Such drama. "Gertrude Lapp. I was born on the second of December, nineteen thirty-two, in my parent's brownstone on eighty-fourth street. It was snowing that morning--"

"Are you kidding me?" Mr. Lapp interrupted again. "You could have gotten off her birth certificate. You wanna play psychic, fine. Hey Nana, why did I need to borrow five-hundred bucks when I was twenty-two?" He crossed his arms and leaned back in his leather swivel chair, seemingly satisfied.

I glanced over to Saul, who nodded solemnly at me. I turned off the music. Alright. Showtime.

Since I hadn't known what sort of questions to expect, I'd evoked Ginnie's spirit the night before in order to go over the basic details of her life and to confirm that she was indeed under no constraint or undue influence when signing her will. But descendants often threw highly-personal questions during arbitration, trying to prove me a fake. That's why I brought the spirits with me, which usually led to some pretty embarrassing situations. Not for me, mind you. 

It would be so much easier if they could *see* Ginnie or spirits in general. But only one in like every couple of thousand people is able to open their Sight. Everyone has a sixth sense -- that prickling feeling on the back of your neck for no reason, or a sudden chill despite the radiator being on full blast? Yup, sixth sense. But to actually perceive spirits, auras, supernatural entities? That takes something more ... tragic. We're talking unlocking your Sharingan sort of tragic. An intense and often traumatic experience, usually involving near-death or witnessing a death, does the trick. Unlocking the Sight should really come with free therapy, but no -- I gotta rely on sliding scale therapy. Thanks, universe.

I turned my head over to Ginnie, and she was shaking her head slowly, a semi-translucent portrait of disappointment. *He went to a brothel on credit. Left his driver's license and car keys as collateral. He came to me and asked me for the five hundred, and I wouldn't give it to him unless he told me the truth. I could always tell when he was lying. Eventually, he spilled the beans, and I gave him the money.* 

I told the room and spared no detail. After that, Mr. Lapp had turned bright pink, even his balding head, and didn't ask any more questions. 

The entirety of her will went to her cat, Peppermint. But Saul would manage the estate as executor, keeping the money in trust. 

After the room cleared out, it was just me, Saul, and Ginnie in the conference room.

"Brothel?" Saul said, grinning. 

"Yeah, I know, right?" I chuckled. "The guy walked right into that one."

"Is she still here?"

I nodded.

"She knows that the money is gonna go to the state once the cat dies, right? She had no other beneficiaries or living family members. I made sure to explain that to her before she signed her will. "

Ginnie said, *Oh yes. I just wanted the satisfaction of that spoiled brat taking it on the chin. It'll be good for his character.* 

"Yup," I said. "All in a day's work."
