There wasn't a title for what I could do, for what I was destined to become. But that would all change in time.

For now, the Viceroy cleared his throat and began granting the four of us titles. First, it was Erik. Captain of the football team, all-American handsome, decent at algebra -- it made sense that he'd be granted the title of Hero by Gracefeel -- the goddess that transported us to this world. 

Erik knelt before the Viceroy and was dubbed Ser Erik the Red, on account of his fiery hair. I wanted to hate him, but the guy was nothing but decent to me back on Earth. Didn't stuff me into lockers or anything. Erik thanked the Viceroy, accepted his sword, and joined the rest of the swordsmen and swordswomen cheering his name.

Next was Daisy. Ah â€¦ Daisy. She gave me a little wave as she approached the Viceroy. I flapped my hand around as if I were an inflatable tube man outside a used-car dealership. My cheeks grew hot, but I didn't care. Daisy had been one of the four chosen. I don't know if I could have handled all of this if she wasn't here with us. But she was. So I could. 

Daisy knelt before the Viceroy as he handed her a wooden staff that still had some shoots growing off the gnarled top and dubbed her, Daisy the Verdant. She was chosen by Gracefeel as her avatar, and, as it turned out, the first cleric to be gifted with the Divine Healing ability in over two hundred years. I wasn't surprised. This was Daisy after all.

Up next was Marco. The air in the room seemed to grow thicker, tenser, as leather-clad Marco stalked up to the Viceroy. The Viceroy smiled and said, "Ah, yes. The Shadowborn." He handed Marco a pair of wicked-looking daggers. "An Assassin requires no title. Only targets. Is this agreeable with you?"

Marco nodded, took the daggers, and disappeared in a puff of smoke. One voice from the back of the room cheered, while everyone else whispered their approval of the kingdom's new assassin.

Then, silence stretched across the throne room. The magistrates and servants looked around at each other, then to the Viceroy. He stood with hands clasped behind his back, nodding slowly to a question only in his head. It wasn't like he'd banish me for being summoned without any combat abilities. That was the gamble, as he'd explained, when we first materialized on the summoning platform deep beneath the palace. There was no guarantee that *any* champions would answer the call. Three out of four wasn't bad, he'd said. Still. There was the matter of what to do with me...

"Master Kleber," he announced, tapping his r's like a Scotsman. "Come forward."

I fiddled with my tunic, taking one hesitant step, then another. Soon I was knelt before the Viceroy, staring down at his worn leather boots and at the purple carpet beneath said boots, leading from the throne all the way to the double doors. I wanted to run down the carpet, tackle my way through the doors, never look back. Instead, I glanced up at Daisy. She was giving me a double thumbs up. Erik was nodding slowly. Marco stood in a corner, shadowed.

I blew out a shaky breath.

"As stated by your fellow outlanders, you are wizened. Possessing knowledges that would enrich the lives of my people. And so, Master Kleber, I dub you First Physiker of Goldmar." He handed me a coin purse and it sank in my hand, as I was unprepared for its weight. "You will be granted an allowance by the crown to perform works benefiting the citizenry of Goldmar. Arise, First Physiker, and may the light be with you."

I blinked at the viceroy. "So," I stammered. "I won't be going with the rest to fight the Demon Lord's armies?"

The Viceroy gave me a pitying look, and shook his head slowly. "No, son. Your place is here."

I thanked the Viceroy and marched out of the throne room, fighting back tears.

My place was here. Not with Daisy.

\*\*\*

There wasn't much to say the day Erik, Marco, and Daisy's departed. Erik promised he'd protect Daisy and make sure they all came back alive and well. Marco peeked at me through stringy black strands of hair, and just said, "Death comes for us all." I nodded and replied with the same. 

Daisy pulled me aside as liveried servants, wearing matching purple tunics, loaded the party's wagon and checked their horses. She was wearing a white open robe over plate and mail with a pair of clasped hands engraved on the heart of her breastplate -- Gracefeel's sigil. I tugged at my itchy brown Physiker's robe.

"Well," she said, with sad eyes over a small smile. "We're going."

I looked down to the dirt. "Yup."

"These people are counting on you."

"I don't know -- it seems like the whole world is counting on the three of you. I don't even know what to do with my abilities. I don't know if they can do anything."

"Maybe," she gripped my arm just above the shoulder. "But while we're out doing what we're doing, these people are still living their lives. Here. Lives that you can make better. Not with fancy powers, but with what you know."

I chuckled. "Yeah, I guess."

"Here--" She handed me a silver necklace. The charm was one quarter of a heart, like the kind you'd find at an ear piercing shop in the mall. She held up my hand and pushed her piece into mine. A moment later, Erik and Marco joined, pushing in theirs, completing the pendant. Daisy looked around at the three of us and smiled. "I'm going to keep these two alive while we kick the Demon Lord's butt. And when we get back, I want to take a dip in a proper sauna, and eat ice cream, and watch Netflix."

I blinked at her. "What? That's--that's impossible."

Erik laughed. "And I thought taking out the Demon Lord was gonna be tough. Looks like you've got the real work."

"I do not envy you," added Marco.

One of the servants announced the wagon train ready. Marco and Erik said their goodbyes and made their way to the wagons. 

Daisy lingered for just a moment, and said, "I wish you could come with us."

It was like an invisible hand clutched my heart and squeezed. I bit the inside of my cheek, refusing to show just how much her words had rocked me.

"Me too," I replied, solemnly.

And with that, they were off.
