"Why aren't you at your post?" asked a basso rumble of a voice. Hades, Lord of the Underworld, wore a robe made of night, stars twinkling and galaxies swirling. His hair was black and swept back from his face in a mane that fell to the base of his neck. His beard was equally black, though marked at the chin with a single streak of silver. His eyes were caverns of endless darkness. But Charon had enough of endless things.

The ferryman's stomach twisted, and he suddenly fought a deep tremble spreading through his legs. Despite his resolve, the Underlord's presence was enough to trouble the waters beneath his feet.

Charon couldn't help but appreciate the Underlord's modest chamber. The furnishings were few, and simple, but they were exquisitely crafted. A wooden panel, stained with fine smoke and time, framed a fireplace, and was carved with images of the Pantheon scattered about the slope of Mount Olympus. Two large chairs of deep, polished red wood and rich black leather sat before the fire, with a low wooden table between them, polished to the same gleaming, deep red finish. On the table was a ceramic bottle. A simple, empty wineglass next to it.

Despite Charon entering through one, now, there were no doors.

Hades sat in one of the chairs in front of the fire, holding a second wineglass in a black-gloved hand. His dark eyes gleamed as he stared at the flames.

"Is it time again already?" Hades rumbled. "Have we not been through this enough, Charon?"

And indeed they had. But every time before this, Charon had been poor in pocket. This time was different, he reminded himself.

"Greetings, Lord Hades," he said after a pause. His voice quavered only a little.

Hades nodded without looking away from the fire, and moved his free hand in a languid gesture toward the other chair. "Very well. Join me."

Charon gingerly set his bone-oar against the back of the chair and sat.

Hades poured wine from the ceramic bottle into the other glass, and Charon took it with a nod of thanks. He didn't sip. Charon wasn't one for wine, or any spirits, except for those he ferried. "I've..." Charon began, then thought better of it and carefully picked through the cargo of words he'd gathered for this moment.

Hades' eyes shifted to him and his head tilted slightly. He nodded.

"By the right of those who serve, and the Ebon Price," he said. "I have come to purchase a soul."

"And which soul would that be, Ferryman? Which soul have you come to bargain for?" Hades replied, his voice buzzing with warning.

Charon got a sinking feeling, as if a leak had sprung in his boat. "I have come for--"

Hades lifted his free hand, palm up, and gave him a long-suffering look.

"It is not what you think, my lord."

Hades smiled, briefly. "Do not think me ignorant, Charon. You could never afford Persephone's soul, ever. She is not some trinket to be bought and sold."

"If you say," Charon said, and regretted his casual tone instantly. For a moment, he wanted very badly to return to his boat, to his task, to eternity. But he'd served for too long and would forever, unless he stood his ground here and now. "That is why I am not bargaining for *her* soul."

Hades arched a dark eyebrow. He took a sip of wine and directed his gaze back upon the fire. "Oh? And then who's soul have you come for then?"

"Mine."

The wispiest shade of a smile line touched the corners of his eyes. "Ah. It appears you have grown, Ferryman."

"I once thought myself clever," Charon said. "But after so much time, so many years, I realized how foolish I'd been."

"The beginning of wisdom."

"My first attempts at navigating its waters."

"Very well," Hades said. "You know the price. Are you good for it?"

Charon rose and padded back to where the door that had lead him to Hades' chamber existed before their conversation began. There, sitting on the polished stone floor, was his bounty. Several thousands years of gathering coins from his passengers, all gathered for one single purpose. Freedom.

Charon dragged the sack, enchanted to hold more than what normally possible, and placed it at Hades' bare feet.

"Is it all there?" Hades asked.

"If it pleases you, count it. I'll wait. I've waited long enough."

Hades' eyebrows went up. He didn't quite smile, but he nonetheless managed to look pleased. "I trust you, Charon." He nodded. "I've always trusted you. I've trusted you to bring me the souls which rightfully belong to me. I've trusted you to ferry Persephone back and forth from the land of the living. To watch her. Guide her. Protect her. I've even trusted you to love her..."

Hades turned to Charon, put his wineglass down, and regarded him frankly. "I believe," he said, "that we are not so different, you and I. For we both deal in death. And we both love fiercely."  He rose and stood before Charon. Then he extended his right arm. "The price is paid. Be free, Charon, former-Ferryman of the River Styx."

It was not possible to shake hands with time. With eons. One cannot shake hands with the profound silence and pure darkness at the bottom of the sea.

But if one could, it might come close to what it felt like for Charon to grip wrists with the Lord of the Underworld, and to receive his blessing of freedom.

"Where will you go?" Hades asked.

"Exploring," said Charon, wistfully. "There are many rivers in the mortal world. I'd like to see them."

Hades nodded. "Yes. Many sights and sounds and sensations to experience. Though, I suspect I will be seeing you again."

Charon drew a slow, deep breath and settled his nerves. There were many worlds to explore. And he would explore them all. As many as it took to forget the smell of pomegranate in her hair. Her smile. Her. "I doubt it, my lord."

Hades' eyes flickered and he gave him a brief nod, perhaps knowing.

Then Black fire swallowed Charon. He was free.
