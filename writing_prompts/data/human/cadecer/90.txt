It was around six-thirty am when the bus dropped me off a block down from Saint Benedicts prep. I made the walk to the playground and sat on top of my backpack, scrolling through my phone. The morning breeze bit at my cheeks, but with my Gryphondor scarf wrapped tight around my neck, I didn't mind the cold. I looked up to the eastern tree line as the sun peeked up over the tips of evergreens, painting the sky in a salmon gray. I didn't used to notice the little intricacies of the early morning, but sitting out here every day before school started gave me the space to just sit and watch and be. Just be.
  

  
"Hey," a familiar voice said.
  

  
I looked up. It was Daisy. She was wearing a forest green scarf she crotched herself which matched her school uniform perfectly. She tossed her leather school bag beside me and plopped down.
  

  
I nodded at her.
  

  
"Rough morning?" she asked, pulling out her phone.
  

  
"Didn't sleep much," I grumbled.
  

  
I didn't tell her why. That it was because my dad had been drunk all night. Arguing with anyone in his field of vision, like an agro mob. But Daisy probably had an idea. Kids like us didn't show up an hour and a half early to school and sit out in the playground because everything at home was peachy keen. I didn't tell her and she didn't push. That's what I loved about her. That and she was painfully cute.
  

  
"I hear ya," she said. "I was up studying. Figured no sleep's better than bad sleep, so, here I am."
  

  
"Here we are." My cheeks growing hotter. "Uh--I mean, here you are. And here I am. Here at the same time--but, you know, separate. Oh boy."
  

  
She laughed. Pop rocks started fizzling in my stomach.
  

  
"Yeah," she said. "Here we are. A couple of early birds."
  

  
A couple, I repeated to myself. A couple of birds. Love birds? No way, dude.
  

  
"Miss Fitzgerald's AP Physics test is today," I blurted.
  

  
"Ugh, don't remind me," she said. "What do you think I was up all night studying for?"
  

  
"Sorry, yeah. It's a tough one, huh--"
  

  
She punched my arm lightly. "Maybe for me. Not everyone can be like you, Bill Nye."
  

  
"What's that supposed to mean?"
  

  
"It means you're a science wiz. I've never seen you get less than a B+ on any of Fitzterribles tests. Or bio, or Calculus, or--"
  

  
"Okay, okay," I cut her off. "I get your point. But I'm horrible at English. And I can draw a stick figure to save my life. Not like you. Your comics are just -- I'd trade my science brain for your artsy brain any day."
  

  
Daisy's expression sank. "You know, I work at that stuff too. It's not that it comes to me without any effort, Kleber. I practice every day. Drawing. Writing. All of it."
  

  
She looked out at the morning sun. A light breeze rustled her bangs.
  

  
I didn't know if I had offended her. It definitely felt like I did. I wanted to sink into the concrete, past the miles of crust, and deeper. Incinerate myself and join the slurry of molten iron at the center of the earth.
  

  
"My bad," I said. "I didn't--"
  

  
"It's okay. I'm the one assuming all this stuff just comes to you without any work either. I didn't mean to discount how much you must study too."
  

  
I chuckled. "Yeah, well. It's a good distraction from everything else. I love playing video games or watching anime, but it's not like that'll get me into a college far away from here. So, science it is."
  

  
"Where you thinking of applying--"
  

  
Our phones made a matching screeching noise, like a Weather Alert, but alternating between pitches like some sort of horrid melody. I pulled my phone out of my jacket. The screen read:
  

  
*SUMMONING REQUEST. DO YOU ACCEPT?*
  

  
I tapped the message and a Yes/No option appeared. I looked over to Daisy and she was gone. Her bag was still on the ground beside me, but she was not there. I looked around the playground to no sign of her. I called out her name. She couldn't have ran off without me noticing.
  

  
My phone screeched again, louder this time.
  

  
Summoning. Did Daisy select Yes? Was this real? Had my phone been hacked?
  

  
I couldn't think of any explanations. All I knew was that Daisy's phone made the same noise. That maybe she got the same option too.
  

  
I picked yes.
  

  
Everything went black.
  

  
\*\*\*
  

  
I woke up. Fileas was standing over me, his right eye shut into a massive bruise. My head was pounding.
  

  
"Oy!" he shouted to someone. "He's awake! He's awake! Hold on, boy-o. You're gonna be just fine."
  

  
"Wha-wha--"
  

  
"Don't talk. You lost a lot blood. We'll get you sorted, just you wait."
  

  
I reached up to grab my aching head. Only one hand reached my face. I held my hands out in front of me and instead of two, there was only one. My left hand was missing. In it's place was a scorched black stump ending just beneath where my wrist begins.
  

  
"My hand," I said weakly.
  

  
"Aye," Fileas said. "You were lucky, boy-o. Lucky to be alive."
  

  
I let my head fall back and closed my eyes. This had to be a dream. And if it was, then maybe I'd find my way back home. Back to the playground, to Daisy.
