"Give me the cash!"

The crank-head brandished a broken beer bottle, slashing at air. He staggered forward. The light bulb over the back door of *Saga Bar & Grille* flickered, strobing the dark alley.

Laura threw her purse at the withered, dirty man. "Here! Take it! I don't--"

The crank-head lunged, stumbled.

The man's full weight landed into her. Heat bloomed in her belly.

When the man pulled back, he wasn't holding the beer bottle anymore.

Laura looked down. The neck of the bottle was sticking out of her torso and her white work polo bled red. "You... fucker--"

Laura dropped to her knees.

The crank-head stuttered something, but she couldn't make it out. Darkness closed around the edges of her vision. She was suddenly cold. Trembling.

The world went sideways. Something hard pressed against her cheek. It was the ground.

As her vision closed to pinholes, she barely registered the crank-head running down the alley and out into street.

*Last time I cover someone's shift*, she thought, before everything went black.

"Laura," a voice said from the black. "Laura, wake up. Wake up!"

Laura slowly opened her eyes. Someone was shaking the shit out of her. "I'm up, I'm up," she groaned.

Her eyes came into focus and Jerry, her manager, was looked down at her, overcast sky behind his head. It was morning.

"What happened? You okay? What the hell are you doing out here?"

The whole right side of her face was throbbing, like someone had crashed a car into her head. Jerry's rapid-fire questions weren't helping.

Laura groaned her way to a seated position, but Jerry put his hands on her shoulders.

"Woah, woah," Jerry said, pushing her back down. "Take it easy."

Snippets of last night flickered through her mind. Walking out of work late, the crank-head mugging her, getting stabbed, and now Jerry's hands. Realization snapped her awake like five cups of coffee. "Get off me!" She slapped away Jerry's hands and sat up. Of all the people to find her, it had to be Mr. Handsy. "I'm fine."

Jerry's eyebrows scrunched up. "Uh, I found you in a pool of blood."

Laura looked down at her stomach. The entire bottom half of her polo was soaked red, and a jagged ring was torn into the fabric, but when she felt for a wound there was nothing but smooth, unbroken skin. A few feet away was a blood-stained, broken beer bottle. "What the..."

"I called 911," Jerry said, reaching around her. His jacket was bunched up on the ground. He must have shoved it under her head. "The ambulance is on its way."

Laura jumped to her feet. "You what? No! I don't have insurance, Jerry. I can't--" She patted her belly. "I'm fine! Okay? I have to go. I'm calling out sick tonight."

Jerry shouted something out behind Laura as she ran down the alley, but it was lost over the thud of her heart in her ears. She should have been dead. But everyone knew that legends never die. What Laura didn't know was what a thirty-year-old divorcee slinging drinks at a townie sports bar had done to earn herself the gift of immortality.

*If anyone knows*, she thought, running down the block, *It'll be Julius*.

Now, if only her ex-husband's brother was willing to talk to her...
