You've gotta wonder why any Brit would make a jump across the pond to live in the States for good. Oh, if they're celebrities they'll have to head off to Hollywood. And for everyone else, perhaps its long distance love? John Francis Baker was not in love, but he was a celebrity of sorts.

Everyday, he'd leave his Manchester flat and head off to the shops for a cherry cheese danish and a large Red Bull. He wasn't much of a cook. And working from home he could get away with eating rubbish more often than not. No one to mind the farts.

If anyone were to ask him, John Francis Baker would say he's got his life right proper sorted. But no one usually bothered him on his walks to Omar's newsstand.

"Oy! Fanny Face!"

It wasn't John's fault that he'd been born with Hypertrichosis. There was no reason to be ashamed for having well conditioned facial hair. That includes forehead hair.

"Oy! You need a razor?"

Aside from the occasional cretin shouting out nonsense as John walked to and from the convenience store, everything was right well sorted.

John switched his grocery bag from right hand to left. He'd picked up more than just danishes and Red Bull today.

Instead of smoothly turning the corner on Cheshire Road and walking two streets over to his flat, John walking straight into someone. He managed to catch himself before falling on his bottom, grocery bag twisting tight around his wrist.

"You alright?" asked John.

"Oy," said the man who was mostly neck. His eyes narrowed to slits and a snarl bubbled deep within his chest and worked its way up to his throat before adding, "You're in my way."

John's heart had been racing since he left the convenience store, but now it seemed to slowdown despite the terror twisting his intestines into animal balloons. *I shouldn't have left so late*, he told himself. *Just get back to the flat. Get back now.*

"What'd you say, freak?" asked the neck man.

John looked up from studying his shoes, truly noticing the person barring his way for the first time. He smelled scared, a sharp, sour scent. Of course, he also smelled angry. It was a toss up between which more than which. The point was, the man wasn't thinking rationally. John had to deescalate things and get back to his cage.

"I said I'm sorry for getting in your way. Sincerely. I hope you have a lovely evening."

When John sidestepped, the neck man snatched at John's grocery bag.

The man moved in slow motion. John sidestepped the man and watched patiently as he pitched forward over John's extended foot and landed face first onto the sidewalk.

John didn't say anything as he sprinted the rest of the way home.

Curtains drawn, John turned up the bluetooth speaker on the kitchen counter playing Top 40 Hits. He didn't have much of an ear for pop music, but it drew less attention compared to Swedish Death Metal.

Waiting for him on a ceramic serving tray was two kilos of raw beef. Blood pooled beneath the slabs of meat and the sweet, coppery scent had John's mouth watering. He'd finished his checklist. It was time to enjoy himself.

After eating, John made his way to the second bedroom. The first was his regular bedroom every night of the month except one. Tonight, he wouldn't be sleeping. That was what the second bedroom was for.

Inside he took off his clothes and stepped into the silver cage. Of course the wrist-thick bars weren't pure silver. John could shatter something so weak, especially in his afflicted state. They were silver-lined. Just enough to deincentivize any attempts to bend the bars.

The cage took up most of the room, leaving enough room for the door to open smoothly. Inside the cage were a series of chain and manacles attached to mechanisms bolted to the floor of the cage. By this point, the motions were smooth and automatic.

Just as John finished attaching the last manacle to his left wrist, there was a crash in his apartment.

The door on the cage wasn't closed yet. The door automatically drew itself shut at a slow speed in case of any last minute emergencies.

John cursed around the muzzle in his mouth as he struggled to find the pull ring inside the locking mechanism at his feet. With his human fingers he should be able to reach inside and easily pull the emergency ring. But his nails were already breaking as sharp, black claws started growing in their place. His fingers grew slick from all the blood. He couldn't reach the ring.

The neck man burst into John's den. He reeked of pride and confidence. But no, there, underneath the pungent brine of his hubris, was the sweet, sweet scent of fear. Yes, so familiar. The man's face twisted into a scream.

John yanked at his bonds.

"What are you?" shouted the neck man. He pointed a pistol at John. "What the bloody hell are you!"

John howled. The delicious smelling man stepped into the cage and fired his gun at John. Some of the rounds hit, most didn't. Insect bites.

The emergency mechanism recognized a second person inside the cage and release all locks and binds in one click.

Chains fell around John into coiled piles.

The neck man turned and ran. John thanked his prey before loping after it.

When John woke up he was not in his second bedroom. He was curled up naked on his living room floor. Bile bubbled up in the back of his throat and he would have vomited if the realization of his situation hadn't hit him like laurie. He was on his feet in a blink ... and immediately regretted it. 

A sinful amount of food sloshed around inside him stomach and physically tipped him off balance. His senses and reactions were still sharp so soon after a change, but he slipped while trying to catch himself on the edge of his sofa. The cushions were soaked in blood, slick to the touch. 

Getting back to his feet, John finally took in his grim work. All around him were what remained of a person. Someone who had broken into his apartment the night before and stopped him from locking the cage.

John darted for the front door and mercifully found it shut with the chain locks engaged. Had the neck man done it? What had he intended to do? Not like it mattered now, John supposed. Now, he had work to do.

*It's fine*, he told himself. *We've done this plenty of times.*

After washing up and setting his go bag by the front door, John set to soaking the apartment in kerosene. He wasn't sure where he'd go next.

*Why not the States?* he mused, tossing the lighter into the living room. *Why not?*
