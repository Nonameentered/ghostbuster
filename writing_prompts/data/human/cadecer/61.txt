My shifts are full of stories. Nothing really weird about that. Most of friends working at other bars will tell you the same. But the strange part about my job, in particular, is that how at night, other sorts of people walk into my bar. Not strictly human people. They order drinks and, eventually, they tell me about their lives, their problems. I listen.

The first time it happened, I was nearing the end of a double-shift at Jenny's Bottle (the owner was named Rick. I still don't know who Jenny is). With just under an hour left before last call, the place was down a trickle of people. Luka, one of my regulars, was posted at his normal spot at the far left corner of the bar. Mary was plugging away at the video poker machine with her three-olive martini in hand. There was a pair of lovebirds in one of the booths shouting over the music about some TV show or another. My crocs were sticking to the floor mats after an unfortunate attempt at mixing champagne with frozen margarita (note to self: don't shake it).

When I looked up from grimacing at my feet, there they were.

If you asked me what they looked like at that moment, honestly, your guess is as good as mine. At first, I thought it was my ex-boyfriend, Tony. The bar's lone mirror glinted from behind the counter with the hazy red light from the neon signs hanging on the walls. I blinked and suddenly it wasn't my scraggly-bearded, sleepy-eyed ex-boyfriend. They were tall, pale, with short blonde hair, a total Tilda Swinton.

I rubbed my eyes with the heels of my palms and they chuckled.

"I do apologize," they said. Their voice was smooth and vaguely British, but not really. It just sounded fancy to my ears. "I have that affect on â€¦ *people's* eyes."

I didn't say anything, and they didn't say anything either. The air thickened into something chewable as the silence stretched, longer and longer. Taffy? It was like I was encased in Taffy.

Finally, I asked, "Can I get you something?"

Their eyes were the color of Red Bull, but glowing. But they didn't show any anger or intoxication. They were sort of sad. I'd seen those kind of eyes plenty.

"Something sweet," they said. "And warm."

Warm? It was the middle of summer. But the electric kettle was still plugged in which I used to make tea for myself at the start of my shift. I could make some more. A splash of whiskey. A dollop of honey. Yeah. I could work with that. "How about a hot toddy?"

They nodded.

As I worked, making their drink, they started talking. That was nothing new. But parts of what they said sounded funny to my ears. Things like names and places. After bartending for a decade, you sort of learn how to half-listen to people. You get the gist of what they're saying while focusing on making drinks and staying generally aware of the bar. By the time I was done making their drink, I'd learned a couple of things.

First, Iden (their name) was nursing a bad breakup. So bad, they got out of town (someplace called Elunora? Illinoya?) and decided to go on a "proper bender."

"Well," I said, handing them their drink. "Hot toddy's certainly are proper. Last call's in an hour, just a heads up. But -- want to open a tab?"

"That would be acceptable."

Mary cursed at the poker machine, accusing it of stealing her last dollar, and Luka barked for another beer. After dropping off Luka's Coors tall-boy, the lovebirds came up to the bar and closed their tab. They left me three bucks on a fifty-three dollar tab. I groaned.

"Something wrong?" Iden asked.

"When isn't there?"

They chuckled. "You know, I don't usually visit the mortal realm. This is nice."

Things sort of clicked then. It was strange. I should have been scared, should have pulled the aluminum bat from under the counter and chased them out of the bar. Because it struck me fully in that moment that Iden wasn't human. But they, by far, weren't the weirdest person I'd served at the ass-end of a shift. No way.

"Glad to hear you're having fun. Say, can I ask you something?"

"Yes."

"What are you? Is that rude? I'm sorry if that's rude."

They sipped their toddy, expression frozen.

"Shit! It was rude. I'm so sorry! Your drink's on me."

They laughed. "No, no. I am having fun with you. Apologies..."

"Nadia."

"Apologies, Nadia. I am what you would call a Changeling. One of the Fae."

"Oh--" I folded my arms across myself. "--like a fairy?"

"Fae. Bit of a difference."

"Right. That's cool. I'm Hungarian. Eh--but I was born in Sacramento. My family's Hungarian."

"Fascinating." They sighed.

"How you holding up?"

"I think I'm going need something stronger."

I set two glasses in front of us and poured a couple of fingers of Powers -- the finest in budget Irish Whiskey. I held up my glass and we cheered.

"Here's to breakups," I said and knocked back my drink, savoring the burn as it tricked down my chest.

Iden sipped at their drink (most proper) and their face flickered, which I took as them trying to play off a scowl of disgust. Not my fault they couldn't appreciate the finest cheapest in spirits.

"I don't know what to do," they said after downing some water I poured for them. "Talrisa was--is the love of my life. Our families arranged us to be wed. It is quite the affair, the union of two powerful families. Uniting courts. And she just runs off to the mortal realm the day before our wedding. No note. No explanations. Nothing."

Ouch. I tried not to wince. At least Tony had the good decency to cheat on me waaaay before we ever could have made the mistake of getting engaged. "Sounds like you're feeling betrayed."

"That is the least of it!" they said. "Betrayed. Embarrassed. Hurt. So hurt. I just need to know why. Why did they run?"

I poured a little more Power for myself. "Why do you think?"

They looked up at me. "I do not know her mind."

"Well, try," I said, failing to soften the edge in my voice. "You're supposed to have married her. You telling me you can't even imagine what she could be thinking? Feeling?"

They sighed. "I see your point. Well, ours was an arranged union. Not uncommon. But, it did take us some time to grow close. Perhaps when it came down to it, when facing the ceremony itself, her doubts got the better of her."

"Did she ever talk about these doubts?"

He shook his head. "No. No she did not."

I shot back my drink and tossed the glass into the wash sink. Some soapy-water splashed on the floor mat. "Wanna know what I think?"

They knocked back their drink and didn't even flinch. Good for them. "Yes," they said.

"I think knowing the reason why she left isn't gonna do anything for you. That's not the problem here. The problem is that you're hurt. And  you have every right to be. Can't imagine getting left at the alter feels good. But -- I also think she must be going through her own world of hurt. Give her space. Keep your phone on. If she reaches out, try, *try* to listen without judging her. Try to understand where she's coming from. And tell her how you feel. I don't know about all the political court house stuff -- if it'll get in the way of you two maybe going through the ceremony at another time.  But if you can get through all this, and still end up getting hitched, I think you two are gonna be better off than like a ninety-nine point nine, nine, nine percent of all couples, ever. You want another?"

They smiled and reached into their jacket. "No.  I have had enough. Thank you." They pulled out a fat gold coin and thumbed it down on the counter. Maybe it was the light, but the thing sort of glowed and hummed like a fluorescent bulb.

"I don't if I can break that," I said, but when I looked up, they were already gone.

I took the coin from off of the counter, opened the register, and slid it under the till.

It was fine. Their drinks were on me.
