"Do be takin' a flare, Jezza," said Dwarf. He'd never given Jezza a name when he signed onto her crew, so she didn't ask. The veteran dwarf with no name always pulled his weight and some. What did names and titles matter anyway?

Jezza snatched a flare from Dwarf's outstretched hand and stuck her tongue out at him. "If I'm lighting a flare then it means this whole operation's gone tits up, Dwarf."

"Aye," he said, heaving his massive double headed battle axe over his shoulder as easy as a broom. "Then I do be coming to save that bony behind of yers."

Jezza reached for Blackthorn's spiked hilt, but drew her belt knife instead  and stalked toward him. "What you did call my behind--"

Marla's staff shot up and caught Jezza across the stomach.

"Easy darlings," the priestess of Archon intoned, her voice rich and raspy. "Let us save the killing for our enemies, no?"

As Jezza stuffed the flare behind her sword belt, Rolo appeared from thin air, as thieves tended to do, and began studying his nails. "Well, chums. I'd say preparations are as prepared as prepared can be. Shall we, master Dwarf?"

"Rolo," said Jezza, raising her chin imperiously, just as the old thief had patiently taught her many a night camped out in some back wood with the rest of the crew. "Don't die."

"And what about me?" asked Dwarf, chuckling.

"I know you'll be fine, Dwarf," she smirked, "But this one? He's prone to heroics."

Rolo gasped. "I beg your pardon--"

"It is time," said Marla, cutting through their complaints. "We walk with the Night Father."

Jezza punched both Dwarf and Rolo on the shoulder (Rolo a little harder) before they left to engage the Demon Lieutenant's two-hundred raiders. Jezza and Marla took their places hidden amongst the treeline along the merchant road cutting through the Fenwood. The raiders rumbled from the south.

In the distance, hooves thundered from the north. The Chosen Hero's knights charged south from Westmarch to engage the enemy raiders. Even if Galen's handful of elite knights managed to defeat a force of two-hundred raiders, he still had the lieutenant to deal with. This was one of the Demon Lord's Five Senses, Bahamal, the Sense of Smell. A former imperial knight turned to the dark against bumbling Galen? Even with that fancy sword, he was no match for one of the Five Senses.

So Jezza would take out Bahamal before he ever reached the "Chosen Hero."

Beyond the treeline, the first of Bahamal's raiders charged past them along the road. It was time.

Marla muttered her incantation and blinding pain shot through every inch of Jezza's body. She gripped a nearby tree so hard her fingers bored through the bark and dug into the trunk itself. Pain was the price for Marla's blessing, but the physical enhancements were worth the agony.

Suddenly the pain vanished and a wave of euphoria washed over Jezza. Her senses sharpened; the world came to life. She sniffed at the sweat in the air, carrying scents of eagerness and fear and anger. She peered out through the tree line and found Bahamal's armored form on horseback as clear as midday, charging at the read of his forces.

It was time.

"If I die--" whispered Jezza, but Marla finished for her.

"I will raise you as a wraith so you may haunt the Chosen Hero until his eventual death."

"You honor me."

&#x200B;

Jezza was never chosen for anything. She'd always been smaller than the rest of the children. She was never chosen as an acolyte at any temple. And she'd not been chosen by the sword. In fact, the holy sword Granglora had turned black the moment she touched the hilt. Un-Chosen. That's what the priests had called her. Not even fit to carry the Hero's saddlebags. But she'd practiced the martial arts since she was old enough to lift a wooden practice sword. That was something she chose.

Appearing out of thin air, Jezza tore a hole through the rear flank of the enemy raiding force. She slashed at ankles and hamstrings, dropping three raiders in a heartbeat. The majority of the raiding force continued north but Bahamal pulled reign and turned his massive black warhorse around. A knot of raiders flanked their lieutenant.

Jezza was not chosen by Grangloria. But there were other swords. Swords that granted great strength. At a price. She tightened her grip around Blackthorn's spiked hilt. No pain. Not with Marla's blessing.

"Take her!" commanded Bahamal, his voice booming like a mountain shifting.

"Now!" Jezza shouted.

Skeletal arms shot up from the hard packed road and grasped each of the raiders by the legs, pulling them to the ground. Marla's work from beyond the tree line. Skeletal arms also reached for the warhorse's legs but the trained animal deftly dodged and crushed bones beneath its mighty hooves. Distracted.

Jezza appeared at Bahamal's flank and streaked forward, running at full speed at the Demon Lord's lieutenant with Blackthorn, the sword that could cut even steel, aimed straight for his neck. Hornet stance.

A white light burst to life between Jezza and Bahamal. Her sword shook in her grip. She must have connected with Bahamal. But her sword should have cut through his plate. She blinked and her enhanced vision recovered.

A knight in gleaming steel breastplate and a long white cloak with a red dove embroidered on the left breast held a long crystal sword that hummed like a chorus against her dark-steel sword.

"Stay back, Un-Chosen," barked Galen. "This is no place for you."

"You fool!" Jezza shouted.

Before she could chastise Galen further, Bahamul swung his rusted morning star in a wide arc. Jezza bounded back from the mace, avoiding the trapped raiders within sword-reach.

The Chosen Hero, Galen Heartborne, stood between Jezza and the Demon Lord's lieutenant, white cloak flapping in the a breezethat always seemed to appear with Galen. Was the cloak enchanted with a wind charm?

Galen stood on the balls of his feet, sword at waist height, perfectly still. Snake stance. He was going to put everything into a counter. But he was no where near fast enough to react to Bahamal's speed. Chosen or not, Galen had not once bested Jezza in a duel. Not once.

Marla's blessing still coursed through Jezza, tingling waves of pleasure washing over her enhanced body. But it wouldn't last forever.

Bahamal dismounted and nodded at Galen, a gesture to a peer. Bah!

Galen raised his sword over his head and it started to sing, a chorus of hundreds reaching crescendo. If made of actual glass, Grangloria would have shattered. Would Galen shatter when Bahamal connected? *Can't let that happen*, she told herself. *Won't.*

Jezza streaked toward Bahamal from what should have been the lieutenant's blind spot, her cursed sword pointed right for his heart in perfect Hornet stance. But before Blackthorn reached its target, Bahamal raised his fist.

Darkness. Jezza charged through fog so thick she couldn't see beyond her outstretched hand. But she did see a pale silver light in the shape of a sword bobbing around in the fog.

"You care for that one," said a voice that seemed to come from right behind her ear. Jezza twisted and cut the fog. She raised her sword over her head and stood on the balls of her feet, yet relaxing her muscles so that she gently swayed like a snake rising out of a basket in a bazaar -- a proper Snake Stance.

"Will he care if I kill you?" Bahamal's voice rumbled from the fog. "Will you?"

Jezza didn't speak. She wouldn't give him a hair of an advantage.

"I imagine you don't, wielding a sword like that. Terrible price for such a trickle of power--"

Jezza strained her ears, searching for Bahamal's taunts. But none came. All she heard was the low whispering rush of the fog around her and the distant bumbling steps of Galen and his stupid glowing sword. Then silence. *No*. Marla's blessing had ended. She fought to keep her stance, her muscles suddenly tensing and her nerves aching for the euphoria.

"Ah," rumbled Bahamal's sardonic basso. "About time."

Then he came for her.
