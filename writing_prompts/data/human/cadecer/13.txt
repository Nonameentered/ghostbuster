Lower Manhattan streaked around me as I ran home through the middle of the night. The streets were mostly empty, save for the occasional pack of drunks or toughs. The morgue was near city hall. That put me a half-hour from home. 

Home. I stopped and ducked into an alley. Rats scurried around my bare toes, squeaking as loud as a dog barking. I stared down at the cobblestones. Could I go home?

"You're late."

I looked up. A boy, perhaps no older than twelve, was standing three paces in front of me. He wore a little red coat and a matching cap of some soft looking fabric. He was pale, almost glowing in the shadows of the alley. What did glow were his eyes. A pair of golden orbs.

"Who are you?" I demanded. When in doubt, get a name. Build rapport. 

"My name is Micky O'Rooney," he said, cool and imperious. "Mistress Aisling has sent me to retrieve you. Come with me."

"Mistress Aisling--wait. Mick O'Rooney? Mary and Michael's boy? Where the hell you've been, boy? We've been half-mad looking for you for a week straight!"

"Would you keep your voice down."

"Voice down? You little--what the hell are you doing out here in the middle of the night like some highway man. Huh?"

Mickey cocked his head at me like a crow inspecting a particularly curious worm, all dead-eyed and mechanical. Then, he said, "You are quite the fool, aren't you, mister Byrne?"

I started walking toward him. "Why you little shit--"

"Enough," he said, and raised his hand. I stopped. I wasn't sure if I wanted to, but I did. Besides, no point fighting a child in nothing but a sheet. Sends the wrong messages. 

"You will come with me," Micky continued, looking positively bored. What was I, laundry?

Whatever forced compelled me to stop suddenly vanished and I could move again. I remember the feel of it, like a hand on the back of my neck. A hand that was not welcome.

"I think you've got it mixed up, Micky," I said. "It's you that's coming with me."

Whatever dispassion the boy had been holding vanished in an instant and he snarled at me. When his lips curled away from his teeth, two stood out to me. Fangs.

Everything happened fast and in the most annoying way possible. 

Mickey leapt at me like a wolf, teeth first, and when I tried positioning myself to dodge, my sheet caught around my left foot and slipped face first into the cobblestones. Not pain, but a dull awareness of impact flooded my face, like washing with ice water, then vanished. I rolled up and found Mickey turning about face out in the street and aiming to take another jump at me in the alley. 

Then an arrow hit Mickey in the head. He stood there for a moment, confused, then another pierced his neck from side to side. Mickey turned to his left and snarled right before something hit him in the chest and he flew back off his feet. He never hit the ground. His body burst into one big flash of flames, leaving ashes and smoke. 

I scrambled to my feet, aware of the footsteps approaching. Heavy booted steps, one after the other. Closer and closer. 

There was a smell. Powers whiskey. The cheap stuff from the Slaughtered Lamb. A figure turned the corner into the alley. It was Tommy.

"Oh, God," I said, relief washing over me. "Cousin, it's me. Sean--"

Tommy's hand blurred. Call it instinct, heightened reaction time, enhanced senses, whatever it was, I moved fast enough to take the wooden stake in the shoulder instead of my heart.  

"Don't worry, Seanie," Tommy whispered. "I'll free you. I'll free you."

I ran. Stakes whizzed past my head, then arrows, then shouts. The night blurred around me and I kept running. All the while, there was a tingling in my left ring finger that only grew stronger the further I ran. Ignoring it, I ran until the city shrank behind me. Until farms dotted the pastures and I could fine an abandoned barn to hole up in for the night.

Tucked into a dry pile of hay, bloodied sheet torn around me, naked and tired and scared half out of my wits, I curled up in the darkness of an abandoned farm and felt more alive than I ever had in my life. I wanted to cry. I wanted to sing. I wanted to drink--whiskey.

The door on the barn shifted and lurched open. A shadowed figure stepped inside.

"I've been waiting for you, dear," said a woman's voice. It had the same brogue as his County Cork kin. When she spoke again, there was an edge in her voice, maybe even worry? "What happened to Mickey?"

I should have been scared. I should have demanded to know who was there. What did they want? How did they know Mickey? But no part of me was suspicious. It was like a dear old, friend--no, family--had arrived. So, I answered her question.

"Sorry to keep you waiting," I said. "Mickey's not with us. I think he burned to death, but very fast-like. Like burning paper."

She stepped into the moonlight pouring through a broken barn window. Raven-black hair. Milk-pale skin. And a pair of glowing gold eyes. Aisling.

"Who killed him?"

"Tommy Byrne, my cousin."

"I see." She gently pulled away my sheet. I was naked in front of Aisling. I wanted to care. I didn't. "We are leaving New York. Do you understand?"

"Aye."

"You will serve me."

"Aye."

"Good. Come with me. We'll roost for the day and we'll head out at first dark."

"Aisling," I said. 

"Lady Aisling," she corrected.

"Lasy Aisling. What am I?"

She smiled and her fangs glittered in the moon light. 

"Oh," she said, "I think you know."

I reached up and, lips curled back and teeth bared, I felt for them. Pricked my finger on the point of one. Fangs. My fangs.
