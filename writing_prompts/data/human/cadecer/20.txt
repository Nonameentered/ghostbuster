When Geiger got back to camp, his mother ran out ahead of the waiting crowd and clutched him in a fierce hug. The caravan had been in a stir about the latest batch of younglings having sneaked out of camp in the middle of the night to forage the ruins. 

Geiger told his story, what he'd seen in the heart of the city. The broken tower, the green cats, the younglings. His mother only listened, her expression carved from stone. She opened her mouth to speak, but it was Elder Namos who spilled the first words.

"So now you know," the handsome, wise elder whispered to Geiger, leaning in close enough so no one else could hear. The three youngling's surviving parents all stood in a huddle close by. All of them crying. "Now you know the truth that all hunters learn upon their first forage. You tried, didn't you? To bring them back with you?"

"You knew," said Geiger. "You knew and you let us go without warning. Why?"

"Because," the elder said, "it's the only way you'll learn. We tell you you're not old enough to forage, to wait. Yet you go. Even if we told you the truth, it wouldn't stop an Ill Wind from blowing, or a piece of rubble dropping on your head or any one of of other countless way you can die. Dying is for grown folks, not for younglings."

Geiger let that sink in. It was a miracle he made it out of the ruins alive. By all rights, he should have ended up trapped just like the other younglings. But he wasn't. He got out. And not alone.

Geiger turned and groaned as he picked up the orange tabby and presented it to Elder Namos reverently. 

"I tried," Geiger said. "And I sort of succeeded."

Elder Namos' eyes went wide. "That's not possible."

Then, Geiger heard it. The yowls. From the darkness beyond the campfires, twin golden orbs emerged from the darkness of night. Cats. At least a dozen of them padded into the camp.

Ever since then, the caravani no longer feared the Ill Wind. For they knew that should their cats turn to green, the only next step is to gather and flee.

Old man Amos flourished his arms as he delivered the last line of his story and bowed dramatically. The ring of caravani around him clapped, some of the older youths whistling and wooting sarcastically. Cal suppressed a chuckle and snort laughed.

The camp started settling in for the night. It was my turn to take first watch, so I kissed Cal goodnight and took my spot at the eastern edge of the camp, hornbow slung over my shoulder and quiver strapped to my right thigh. 

Meister purred at my feet, preening his chest fur with that violent lick cats do to lick hard to reach spots. 

I leaned back in my heels and rubbed my bump as I stared out into the night. 

To think there was a time the caravani travelled without cats. How could they have lived with such fear, such uncertainty? Would it have been responsible to bring a child into the world with such a risk? 

Meister sat up and stared south. The fur along his back started bristling and a low growl rumbled from his tiny chest. 

"What do you got?" I asked, nocking an arrow in my bow. 

In the lantern light, Meister's fur shimmers as the gray withers into a rotting green. 

He yowls and a breeze starts kicking up.

I'm already running for Cal.
