\[Part 2\]

Nance curled up on the couch, wrapped in a knitted shawl. She stared at the blank television screen. Odesspreni curled up on George's recliner. She certainly could fit considering how small she was for a demon. Despite looking like a child, the horns made it clear what she was.

Nance didn't know what time it was. She hadn't eaten at all today, or yesterday, or the day before. Was this how it happened? She'd watched enough Lifetime movies and read enough romance novels to know of it. When one lover dies, the other follows shortly after. It wasn't like she wanted to die. But she just couldn't bring herself to eat. Not after Gargbianni had refused her request for the hundredth time.

That was when Odesspreni started showing up. She never spoke more than a couple of words at at time. She'd just curl up near Nance and be with her. Sometimes, when Nance woke up on the couch, she'd find Odesspreni curled up beside her. Nance didn't mind.

Odesspreni sat up. She pulled a sandwich out of thin air and started casually munching on it, curling back into a little lump. The smell of cucumbers and dill wafted their way to Nance's nose.

Nance must have been staring because Odesspreni held out her sandwich to Nance and asked, "Want some?"

"Sure," Nance lied. She didn't want to disappoint her little friend.

\*\*\*

"Thank you," said Nance, when Peccitance the demon reached into his tan trench coat and pulled another another tissue for her. Nance dabbed at her eyes and looked around the garage. The dust was too much.

"No problem," said Peccitance.

Odesspreni was still curled on George's recliner, where she'd left her. Nance still spent time with her, here and there, but not as much now. Gerna was shoving boxes into a U-Haul bound for the Goodwill (despite her initial demands that everything "get sent to the dump." Gargbianni helped convince her otherwise.)

"I was talking to Linade the other day," Peccitance said. "He mentioned something about the beach?"

Nance's chest tightened. She felt herself slipping back into the chasm, where nothing touched her. Not joy, not sadness, nothing. But, she looked up at the demon, straight into his pitch-black eyes and said, "Yes. I have something important I need to do. Butâ€”I can't do it alone."

Peccitance smiled. "Good thing we're here. Oh, I know someone that's been itching to meet you."

\*\*\*

Nance's toes dug deeper into the cool sand. Waves crashed and died against the shore, water lapping up close but not quite reached Nance and seven other pair of bare feet in the sand.

One of those feet belonged to Fregi. They stepped up beside Nance, on her left-hand side, and stared out at the ocean. The breezed tugged at their white linen dress. Fregi turned and smiled a smile that was warm and knowing and patient.

Nance smiled back. "Thank you," she said. "Thank you all for being here."

Seven voices grunted or chuckled or said "You're welcome."

Nance blew out a breath and removed the lid from the urn. "I hated tea. I hated your record collection and all the junk you packed into that garage. I hated that you lied to me about being sick." She stopped. Peccitance stepped up to her right, tissue in hand. Nance shook her head smiling. The tears felt good. "But I loved every second of being with you. I love you, George."

Some of the ashes reached the water. Some of them were carried off by the breeze. But all of them left the urn.

To Nance, that was all that mattered.
