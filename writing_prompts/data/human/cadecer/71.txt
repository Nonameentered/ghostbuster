When Jeorge finished his story, he knocked back the rest of Olivan's brandy and chucked the bottle. Then he pointed to me and shouted, "You can take my wife, thatcher, but you can't take my victory. This is mine, all mine."

Everyone turned to face us, and I pulled Darna closer. 

His barbs didn't bother me. They never did. Darna wasn't happy. That was all there was to it. But what did bother me, what nagged and tugged at the back of my mind was his story.

Jeorge, the town drunk, eluded his guards, crossed a stretch of distance that'd take a man a week on horseback, infiltrated a lord's manor, and slew a dragon. I didn't believe it. Couldn't.

But the messenger sent word. Lord Strazian was indeed dead.

And there, on the lawn, for all of Dimbrook to see, was the head of a dragon.

I don't believe his story. And, I've come to accept that we may never know the whole truth. But I cannot deny what my eyes show me.

Jeorge, the Grape Knight, stood bloodied atop a dragon's severed head. 

You can't make that up.
