\[Part 2\]

My work as Goldmar's Physiker mostly involved paperwork. Or, scrollwork, rather.

The small office the Viceroy's magistrate provided me was in the back of a chemist's shop in the town proper. Really, it was a storage room, but Fileas the chemist had set up a small desk and a cot for me in an uncluttered corner. The rest of the "office" was packed with crates filled with minor healing potions -- all of which were bound for the warfront in the north.

My job was to help Fileas with the shop's accounting. Of course to do that, I'd need to learn their runic-looking language. So, my other job was becoming literate (shoutout to Gracefeel for giving me common-tongue but not letters).

Fileas poked his head into the office and said, "I'll be right back. Gotta square up with some picky fellows down by the herb farms. I'll be lockin' up the front door, but in case ye need to pop out, go out the back. The door locks itself, aye?"

"Aye," I said, not looking up.

After a week of toiling away in the chemist's dusty little back room, I was used to Fileas' sudden departures. For a man that small and round, he moved like a track-star, running around town paying off debts or collecting them in kind. There was never any actual customer transactions at the counter, from what I'd seen so far.

Mostly, it seemed, that the common folk of Goldmar couldn't afford the potions produced by the chemist. And if they could, there was a strict ration in place to ensure the warfront's supply was never light.

A knock outside shook me from my daydreaming. It couldn't have been Fileas. I walked out and saw a face peeking through the curtains covering the front window. It was a young girl. She knocked on the glass again, rattling it in its frame. She was going to shatter the damn thing. I didn't need this.

I opened the door, and said, "Excuse me, miss--"

The girl threw her arms around my legs. "Please help! Please, please, my auntie's dying."

"I--uh, wait."

The girl looked up with big, watery eyes -- the violet almost lost with how bloodshot they were. "You're the Physiker? Please help. Please--"

She collapsed.

I scooped her up in my arms and brought her into the shop. Maybe her aunt was indeed dying, but right now, she needed help.

\*\*\*

When the girl woke up, I'd already dried and wet two rags over her forehead. She was burning up. As it turned out, Blood Fever had spread from the port and made its way to the farming villages. Goldmar, being perfectly in between the two, served as a stop gap. Any infected that wandered into the city were placed under mandatory quarantine until they recovered or... did not recover. This girl, and her aunt, I assumed were part of the quarantined.

The girl blinked her eyes open. "Phys--Physiker..."

"Hey, hey," I said, dabbing her forehead. "Yes. I'm the Physiker. What's your name?"

"Lena..." She closed her eyes. "My aunt is--"

"Yes, she's sick. I know. Save your strength, Lena. We'll get this sorted out."

Lena reached into her tattered dress and pulled a folded over piece of wax paper. She held it out to me, hand trembling, and said, "For--for..."

The office door flew open and Fileas barged inside. "Oh, lemme tell yah," he crooned. "Nothing as good as collecting on a ol' debt, boy-o. Sure, a cup of wine's pretty good after a long day--well now. What have we got here?"

I dabbed Lena's forehead and turned to face Fileas. "Her name is Lena. Her and her aunt are sick. Blood Fever, I think--"

Fileas jumped back to the door way. "Well what in the nine hells is she doing here? Get her out of here!"

"She's a customer," I growled.

"Boy-o, she ain't no customer. Customer's got coin. And considering how many holes she's got in her pockets, I doubt she can even carry any coin." He softened his voice. "Come on. I'll help ye get her to the sick house. You mentioned an aunt? She's probably there lookin' for her."

"I don't think she's gonna make it, Fileas. She's in rough shape. What if we gave her a healing potion? For her and her aunt?"

"That's what the sick house is for, boy-o. They get their weekly ration. It's all accounted for. We can't be givin' extra to every sickly lass that comes knocking on my door. There's a war going on. Understand?"

"I understand," I said, failing to dull the edge in my voice. "What if I bought it for her? My coin. What then?"

He shook his head. "Still comes out of the same stock, boy-o--"

"Stop calling me boy-o. I am First Phsyiker Kleber Arroyo and it is my sworn duty to help the people of Goldmar. And that is exactly what I intend to do."

Fileas straightened and squared his posture to face me. "Aye. But at the cost of the war effort? What if the potion you buy now for this girl could have saved the life of a soldier wounded in battle. A soldier fighting and dying to keep the Demon Lord's armies from trampling south and slaughtering us all? No, First Physiker. I'm afraid your coin is no good here."

Lena started coughing. I looked back to her and she held up the wax envelope, saying, "For the potion. For the potion."

I opened the envelope. Inside were a bunch of herbs I didn't recognize. I held them up to Fileas and asked, "Are these..."

Fileas eyed the herds. His eyebrow shot up and he said, "Well, I'll be. Them's the ingredients for a greater healing potion. Dried out, but viable. Where you'd get these little miss?"

"Please help my auntie," she said, weakly.

"You can badger her for sources after you help," I snapped.

Fileas padded over, took the herbs, and made his way back to the door. He paused for a moment before adding, "Well, you coming?"

"Me?"

"Aye. This is your mess, First Physiker. Time to earn that fancy title."

I tucked Lena under my wool blanket tight, made sure the rag on her head was well-placed, and followed Fileas out to his lab. This was more than just my mess. This was the kingdom's mess. But either way,  I was going to fix it.
