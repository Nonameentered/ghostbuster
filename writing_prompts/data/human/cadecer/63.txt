"No, sir," Rolan said in a well-practiced pleasant tone, his face hurting from the strain to keep smiling. "I do not think you were born yesterday."

The city lord slammed a meaty fist on the counter, his fat pinky ring clacking against the wood. "Listen here you bumkin. I am not paying twelve shinnings for a new hilt. The sword's only worth six!"

It would be so easy. The sword was right there on the smooth, freshly polished counter. Rolan had spent most of the morning wiping it down. According to Master Luhart, if he had time to lean, he had time to clean. Well, right now, he had time to cleave ... a head clean from its entitled shoulders.

"You hear me, boy?"

Rolan snapped back from his sweet, sweet fantasy. The customer was glaring daggers up at him.

"I'll see what I can do," he said, bowed, and ducked into the hallway leading to the workshop.

When Rolan had won the apprentice lottery, everything had changed for him. His parents were overjoyed, danced around him as he read the letter of invitation from the Ingport Smithing Guild. A country mouse like him was going to the city, THE city. They weren't destitute. His family had been growing apples and tabbac for generations on their little farmstead. But Rolan hadn't wanted to be a farmer. He wanted more. So much more.

Then he got it.

But the life of a city apprentice wasn't like the stories. He wasn't hammering iron and steel into swords or armor. He wasn't working with masters and learning their hard-earned secrets. He was a clerk. A punching sack. A target.

Rolan knocked on the heavy door leading to the forge and closed his eyes. The sounds of hammer on metal, clinging and clanging, carried through the door. As did the smell of soot and sweat. Everything he wanted.

Through the door, a gruff voice barked, "WHAT?"

Rolan pinched the bridge of his nose and shouted, "Customer wants a discount!"

The door flung open and Master Luhart growled, his cracked-leather face pinched into a familiar scowl. Sweat streaked rivers down his soot-smudged cheeks. "What have I told you about discounts?"

Rage bubbled up from the bottom of Rolan's stomach, hot and sour. Rolan knew the answer. Master Luhart knew Rolan knew the answer. They'd been through this so many times. But that didn't change the fact that customers still asked for discounts. And that going to the back to ask Master Luhart for a discount was the *only* way to mollify the vipers at the counter. They all knew it. And yet... "No discounts for anyone but the—"

"Anyone but the Queen herself," Master Luhart finished. "Has her highness graced us with her presence, apprentice? Has the defender of the Seven Realms brightened my doorway?"

Rolan's face hurt. He was clenching his jaw again. "No," he said through his teeth.

Master Luhan sucked in a deep breath and shouted, "THEN WHY ARE YOU BOTHERING' ME!"

Then he slammed heavy door on Rolan's face.

Rolan was never an angry child. In fact, his parents always said he had the patience of a saint. But that was because they couldn't hear his thoughts. When Tarwyn Gol shoved him out of the way and took his place in line when the sweet ice vendor came to their village, Rolan didn't cry, didn't shout, didn't fight. He laughed it off and took his new place in line behind Tarwyn. But in his mind, oh the things he did to that boy. Things that no child should ever consider. Should know how to consider. So much blood.

"BOY!" the city lord shouted from the counter.

When Rolan turned the corner and walked through the doorway into the storefront, he'd rebuilt his composure, apology and smile at the ready. But the city lord was gone.

In his place stood a dark, dangerous looking man. That was what Rolan's instincts screamed at him. He was tall, a good head taller than Rolan who was never mistaken for short. His face was all hard lines and edges, as if carved from stone. Rolan's eyes searched for the man's hands and could not find them. They were buried into his long black coat. *A robber?* Rolan thought to himself. *No, he couldn't be that brazen.*

"Nice little shop you've got here," he said, in rumbling basso. His accent was more dockside than city proper, smoky and sing-songy. "Sellin' swords, yeah?"

"Yes, we sell swords," Rolan said, reaching his hand under the counter for the dagger strapped underneath. "What happened to the customer that was here?"

The stone-faced man smiled and it softened his features. His eyes were dark and seemed tired. "I sent him on his way." From his right coat pocket he pulled a sword in a shabby leather scabbard. It was half as long as Rolan, and there was no way it could have fit inside a coat. The man set the sword down on the counter in front of him. "What can you tell me about this sword?"

Rolan stared down at the weapon. Yes, the scabbard was made from worn leather. And so was the hilt. But there was something about the sword that drew Rolan closer. Like it was calling to him. He reached out a tentative hand and ... when he grabbed it, everything went white.

Then he was back. Standing at the counter, sword drawn and pointed forward. The steel was nearly white and caught the sun shining in through the shop windows, like it was drinking it in.

"Welcome back," said the man, standing beside Rolan, behind the counter.

"Ah, you can't be back here!" Rolan snapped, his senses catching up to him. "What — what happened?"

The man clapped his hands, waved them around fingers flittering, and held his palms up. Above them, an image appeared. It was of an armored knight holding a shining sword.

"My name is Theromine," he said. "And I am a Magi. I have been searching a long time for the one who could wield this sword. It seems my search is over."

"I don't understand."

Theromine nodded. "Look at the picture."

The knight started moving. He ran forward, sword glowing brighter, and reached a horned monster twice as tall as himself.

"A great evil walks the land, corrupting and destroying everything in its path. Soon, if nothing is done, it will destroy the world. Everyone and everything. But you, the Sword Saint, have the power to stop it. To save humanity."

The knight leapt into the air and stabbed the monster with his sword. The image flashed white then faded away. Theromine clapped his hands again and said, "Well. I'll give you a moment to collect your things and then we'll head out."

Rolan stared down at the sword, then at Theromine, then at the front door of the shop. In one smooth motion, he jumped over the counter and ran for the door.

"Where are you going!" Theromine shouted after him.

Rolan turned and could not hide his grin. "There's a monster I need to slay. I'll cleave his head clean from his entitled shoulders."
