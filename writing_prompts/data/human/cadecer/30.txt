"It's not a gremlin," Antides said, pinching the bridge of his nose between thumb and first-finger. "It's a trait."

"But it's wrong," said the apprentice, scratching his head over Antides' outstretched spell scroll.

"I know it's wrong," replied Antides, "but if I change it, reality gets all wonky."

And it would. The second level chanter's workstations in the mage tower were nearly hex-proof, ancient and ridiculously powerful runes carved into each and every stone from floor to ceiling protected the tower and those inside from the inevitable lash-back associated with chanting spells with errors, or gremlins, including spells ranging from fireballs to gravity bombs. Spells that Antides had constructed and submitted to the higher-ups for over twenty years by himself. But spells that rewrote reality? even the tower's runes combined couldn’t do anything if they suddenly turned into beans.

Kelbin the apprentice winced.

"We aren't turning it in like this, are we?"

"We most certainly are! You see this block of runes controlling the mana flow, here? This is from the High Magus' personal codex. Top of the line, universally translatable, and up to regulation. Sure, I could spend my nights writing custom runes that would better fit this spell, but this project is due by week's end and I don't get paid for drafting experimental code on my own time when I could be sleeping. I get paid to use what resources we've got to cobble together functional spells within the allotted time. So yes, the runework is technically wrong, but functionally, when chanted it will make corn grow twice as fast for one happy farmer. You understand?"

"Yes," Klebin said, worrying at the hem of his robe sleeve. "It's not our job to make it right; it our job to make it, period."

"Aye, I suppose," Antides said, chuckling. "That from a song?"

Klebin smiled and shook his head slowly.

"From my da," Klebin said. "It's his go-to saying."

"I see," he said. "Well, he sounds like a wise fellow, indeed. Here, go on and turn this one in. I'll start the next one and show you my outlining method."

\*\*\*

Antides walked home as he did every day after work. Being promoted to a Master Enchanter of the Third Level did not come with a raise, so porting was still out of budget. Tower jockeys like him hoofed it everywhere, just like everyone else.

To his left, a construction crew chanted and concrete blocks slowly rose and fell into place, filling in a future wall. On the street in front of the site, candles flickered in the breeze. Candles stacked together in a shrine.

"Someone ate it last week." The shrill voice cut through the din of bustling pedestrians, coaches rumbling over cobblestones, and the construction crew chanting across the way. Antides turned and saw a balding, gnarled up oak of a man with the suggestion of hair across his barren pate.

"I heard," Antides told him. "Real shame that. Officials said it was human error, I believe."

The hunched man scowled at his general surroundings it seemed and said, "Human. Oh yes. Was a human hand that wrote that limp-dicked spell. A human's at fault for dropping a slab of rock on my nephew."

A young woman came out of the building behind the man and gently ushered him inside like a mother with a grumpy toddler. A grumpy, grieving toddler.

Still, what did he know?

\*\*\*

Klebin was furious. Antides was at his work station, facing away from the lacrima broadcasting the latest news from across the city, straight to the crystal screen. Today's news involved a collapsed building in the heart of the market district, a building that collapsed mid-construction. Talking heads in the corners of the screen were bouncing back and forth possible blame. None of them mentioned the spells.

"What are we going to do?" asked Klebin.

"Finish this project," Antides replied, soreness gnawing at his shoulders. He really should stop hunching. "Send it off. Start a new one. Rinse. Repeat until you're old enough to retire."

"It's not right," the apprentice growled. "The people need to know."

"Easy now," Antides said, turning on his stool. "Talk like that's liable to get you censured. Or worse." He leaned in closer, lowered his voice just above a whisper. "You and I know these spells are fine for what they are. They work. What happened there—" He pointed to the lacrima's screen. "—that's a tragedy. No logic or causation. Just plain bad luck."

"You really believe that, don't you?" Klebin asked, his face twisted in judgment. Judgement! Then he went suddenly quiet.

"Yes, I do," he growled. Antides bit back some of his anger and continued, "There's no villains here, boy. The spells only go sideways when used not as intended. Everyone knows that. Everyone. So some drunk shows up to work in his cups, unfurls a spell scroll and rolls an R when he should flatten it, or switches up tenses mid chant, or any number of ways to misfire a perfectly good spell. That's on them; not us. I won't take on their sins as my own. My conscious is clear."

That taught him good; but just in case, "It's not our job to built it right; it's ours to build it. Period."

Klebin hurled an ink pot at Antides' face and would have connected had he not lost his balance and fell backward off his stool, landing flat on his back like a sack of unwashed laundry.

"Are you out of your wits?" but Klebin was already marching off headed for the exit.

The higher ups better not try to stick Antides with another apprentice. If they wanted to knock him back down to Enchanter Second Level, that was their prerogative.  Antides simply did not work well with others. Nothing else to it.
