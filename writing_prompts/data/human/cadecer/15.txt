Like most generation spanning vendettas, this one started with a misunderstanding. 

Let's start with the particulars, because we're bound to get tangled up in this yarn at one point or another and its best we get our bearings straight from the onset.

In 1812, I came over to the New World from County Cork, Ireland; so did my Da and my Ma, my brothers Christian and Finnegan, and my sisters Angela and Siobhan, and my cousin Tommy. My cousin came along with us because he'd lost his parents, my Aunt Nora and Uncle Liam, in a goblin raid on their farm. He wasn't the same after that, and how could he be?

Point is, the Byrne clan had had enough of beast and famine. So we picked up and headed for New York. 

The city welcomed us with open arms then spat in our eye as we leaned in to embrace it. The kin that'd come over from Ireland had all packed into the same block down in the East Village. Not that they had much choice, considering most landlords weren't renting to Irish folk. So many people packed into some buildings, it was hard to notice when any of them went missing.

Tommy and I were stumbling down toward the cannery for our shifts, still pissed from the night before, when we heard old Mrs. Sullivan gabbing with one of the neighbors about Micky O'Rooney going missing. Oh, his family was gutted. They were searching for lad high and low, even rounded up a posse to search the neighborhood block by block, but no sign of poor Micky. That's when Mrs. Sullivan suggested it could have been one of those "fancy vampires."

Tommy stopped and leapt on the poor woman, shaking her for details. Was she joking? Are there actual vampires here in New York? Where was the last place they saw Micky? I had to put him in a headlock just to pry him off poor Mrs. Sullivan who was swinging her pudgy fists at Tommy's head, spouting curses and asking for Christ's forgiveness in the same breath.

We were late for work. Later, during our ten minute lunch, I was inhaling a bowl of shepherd's pie from The Slaughtered Lamb tavern, letting the gravy-soaked potatoes and minced lamb massage away the last dregs of my hangover. Stomach full, I asked Tommy what that business was about earlier with Mrs. Sullivan. He looked me with a dead-eyed look that sent shivers down my spine. I hadn't seen him like that since that night with the goblins. Maybe noticing that I was all nervous, he looked away and said, "We came here for a fresh start. There's no room for monsters here. There can't be."

That night we went back to The Slaughtered Lamb, which was where we'd gotten proper pissed the night before. Now, what you've got to understand is that there weren't many places there were keen on serving folk like us, let alone letting us inside the damned building. But the Lamb was owned by a fellow by the name of Ryan. And that was that.

And aside from a lack alternatives, I particularly enjoyed the Lamb because of one raven-haired, blue-eyed, pale-skinned angel by the name of Aisling. She worked at the Lamb serving drunks and soon-to-be drunks. I was in love. I thought if I worked hard enough at the cannery, maybe I could work my way up. Earn enough to open my own tavern. She and I could run it together. Pass the place on to our children, Nolan and Tallulah. The only problem was, Aisling didn't know my name. But had a plan for that.

That night, I sat in the rear of the Lamb where Aisling worked most often. Her sister younger sister Rose worked the front more often than not. Tommy was muttering something about Micky O'Rooney and going hunting when Aisling passed by our table. I reached out and grabbed her fingers to get her attention, just for a moment. She stopped her stride and looked down at my hand for a second with a look of confusion, then she smiled and asked if I needed anything. I ordered two beers and asked for her name. She said Aisling, which I knew, and I introduced myself. "Sean Byrne," I said. "Pleasure to meet you, missus Aisling."

"Miss is fine," she corrected. I smiled back.

Per usual, Tommy and I got right proper pissed and stumbled out of the Lamb into a chilly October night. A fog had rolled in from the river and we whistled, arm in arm, as we turned into the alley cutting through the block and saving us a good two blocks on our walk home. It was a full moon, making it easy to see enough despite my pure inebriation, but the clouds rolled and suddenly the alley was cast into darkness.

There, in the moonless night, a pair of golden eyes flickered to to life like two candles. They swayed in the darkness, as if some great wolf was lumbering toward them. Tommy shoved me aside and I stumbled right onto my arse. He pulled a knife from his belt and threw himself at the eyes, screaming his head off.

From my vantage point, the ground, it looked like Tommy was swallowed up by the darkness. After a long moment, the clouds passed and the moon appeared once more. Aisling was standing in the alley over Tommy's motionless body. 

I couldn't move. Couldn't speak. I just stared at those golden eyes as if they were the barrel of a gun pointed right at my head. "You're coming with me," she said. When she spoke, there was something off about her mouth. I kept glancing between eyes and lips, back and forth. When she smiled, I understood. Fangs. Two long, glittering, fangs poking out from under her top lip. I blinked and she was gone, then she was on top of me. Fire burned in my neck and I felt myself punching at her, pushing, shoving. It was like trying to move a wall. 

Darkness started creeping in at the corners of my vision and I thought to myself, *Oh. I'm dying.* Then I passed out.
