There are bars all over New York. Some so hidden it's a wonder anyone finds them on purpose. Some so familiar, you'd think you walked into the same bar from the night before. Maybe you had? Five boroughs, dozens of neighborhoods within each, each with a bar on damn near every block. The makings of a pub crawl long enough to last a lifetime, enough to get lost.

I'd been crawling since I bought my first fake ID from a tattoo shop on St. Marks place for my seventeenth birthday. That was the best night of my life and I couldn't tell you what happened. Now, at the ripe old age of twenty-four, I'm busy working my way through Brooklyn's watering holes. Except for one spot I kept finding myself in at least once a week.

The Left Hand Path was a hole in the wall that doubled as a dive bar in Ridgewood, a neighborhood in Brooklyn made up of abandoned storefronts and long suburban blocks feeding into Trinity Heart Cemetery. At the Path, you could get a beer and a shot for three bucks any time, any day of the week. It wasn't a first date sort of place. You didn't bring your parents here when they came to visit from Ohio or whatever mid-level state they came from, and you definitely didn't come here for cocktails. Just wasn't done.

There were seven stools in front of the scratched up bar. The walls were covered in crushed red velvet and the radio always had classic rock crackling away. And Julio, the only employee who was not the owner, he'd remind you at least four times in a night. I was pretty sure he didn't pay his taxes. The Path was my home bar.

It was there that I met Basil Easton.

It was a slow Tuesday night, and I was sitting alone at sixth stool, my stool, at the Path, nursing my third beer. The Jameson was still burning in my chest when an old man, clearly messed up, stumbled through the door.

He took the fifth stool and nearly tipped off. Once settled he turned to face me. His face kept weaving in and out of the edge of my vision. I sighed and looked over.

His eyes weren't half-closed and he wasn't drooping or swaying. He was clean shaved and his thinning gray hair was combed and gelled.

"Wanna hear a story, boy?" he asked in a sorta-Southern accent. It was mixed with something European maybe.

The Left Hand Path doesn't get a lot of talkers. Sure, there's regulars. But none of them talk to each other. I think everyone makes up little stories about the other patrons. *Jerry Flatface got a new fur coat. Never took him for a fur kind of guy, but it looks good on him.* That sort of stuff. And it wasn't like I had anything else going on the rest of the night. It seemed like everyone had their read-receipts off nowadays.

"Sure," I said.

The man, who introduced himself as Basil Easton, ordered a Corona with a shot of rail Tequila, refused the salt, and ate the wedge of lime whole, rind and all. Once his mouth stopped puckering, he said, "I call this one the shifting forest. Although not all of it might be true, I chose to believe it. The question is, will you?"
