Adam crept through the narrow hallway looking over his shoulder, his red Chucks tapping along the hardwood floor. He clutched his shirt sleeves, pulling them down taught, making sure no part of his wrists or hands were visible. The tattoos on the back of his hands weren't anything special, just a pair of blindfolded angels — one on each hand — holding up scales. There was no color to the ink or significant shading. But they were needled in memory of his father. He wasn't used to hiding them.

The low-ceilinged hallway was creaky, the whole building just a giant box of plywood and two-by-fours piled atop a stone foundation. It smelled like pine and lacquer. *Guess they're ages away from sheetrock*, he thought. *Or electricity.*

Adam turned a corner into the busy kitchen, slipping past sweaty cooks as they stirred or chopped, and popped out behind the Charging Goose inn. He scanned the shaded alley. Waves of color swirled over his vision, as if he were swimming through a rainbow; in the distance he could make out only a few glowing white lights, each flickering like a candle. That was because of the *Sword of Omens* tattoo inside of his left wrist. The Thundercats tattoo gave him sight beyond sight; it let him see the locations of other tattooed people, up to maybe half-a-mile away, even through walls. If he concentrated hard enough, he could zoom in on one of the lights until a ghostly image of the person formed.

When it came to the three wizards, he didn't have to zoom. Three balls of light still flickered inside the Charging Goose. Right where Adam had left them. Each of them bobbed and shifted like the flies buzzing around the dank alley. The alley smelled like walking down a New York city block on garbage day in the middle of summer, during a sanitation strike. Pungent.

He should have run. But where? The slightly-faded skeletal pirate holding a treasure map inside his right bicep started itching, and so — once more — he willed the tattoo to life. A translucent map held by two skeletal hands floated in front of him. He could pinch and zoom the map, in or out, as if using Google Earth. It was the first tattoo he'd "activated" when he arrived to this world; he wasn't sure what would happen with the rest of his tattoos, except for the *Sword of Omens*; attempting to activate more than two at the same time had given him a splitting headache — so the *Sword* and the treasure map were all he used. He snickered at the map.

Adam recognized nothing; no matter how much he zoomed out, the land masses were completely foreign. The layout of the city he was currently in sort of looked like a smaller Brooklyn if he rotated it to the right and added a bunch of trees. The treasure map had helped him navigate from the clearing in the middle of the "Dark Wood" he'd woken up in, up to the city; he then wandered the cobblestone streets, asking for directions to any sort of transport station, a medieval Port Authority.

No such luck. And worse, at the slightest notice of his tattoos, most folks ran from him … or tried "dueling" him. His best, and only, strategy so far had been to keep his arms and legs covered (easy considering he'd arrived in jeans and a long sleeved Nirvana t-shirt) and run like hell when any wanna-be Slytherins threatened to throw down.

Adam gave one final glance behind him, counted the three glowing balls to make sure they hadn't figured out his escape route, and stalked out of the alley into the city street. Goldmar had apparently once been a booming fishing town. That was what one of the locals had said to Adam — and he understood, possibly thanks to the *Sword of Omens*. Adam wasn't sure —  before he noticed Adam's tattoos. The local ran mid word. Another local had told Adam that the fish suddenly dried up, and things went belly up pretty quick after that. With the village and with their conversation. She had noticed his tattoos too.

Now, the little coastal town felt as creepy as Innsmouth, though there were no such things as fishmen (he hoped). Adam needed to find a way home. That meant finding someone willing to talk to him. And maybe he could get something to eat along the way. He felt like he hadn't eaten in days.

Adam turned right on the main street and headed north, out of Goldmar toward the mountains, his Chucks kicking up dust with every step. Head down and shoulders hunched, he walked like everyone was in his way, like he was late for work — a New Yorker's gait. He knew his outfit made him stick out like a bloody thumb. The few people out on the streets were rocking proper Ren-Faire attire. But new clothes probably cost money and Adam was pretty sure they didn't take dollars here.

Laughter; multiple people laughing behind him, growing louder, closer. And heat. Adam reacted immediately, willing his *Sword of Omens* to grant him sight behind his back. He focused and three glowing balls of light formed into the shapes of the three tattooed wizards from the inn. One of them, the tall lanky one with greasy black hair and an edge lord attitude, stood with his hands over his head. In his hands was a literal fireball, and it was getting bigger.

Adam broke into a dead run. His Sight still showed him what was happening behind him, as if his left eye were staring into a rear view mirror while his right was looking forward. The lanky wizard shouted something and dropped his arms. Adam hurled himself into an alley, hitting the cobblestones hard. Behind him, the fireball, now the size of a beanbag chair, screamed down the street. Adam could have sworn his Chucks were melting. As he scrambled to his feet, the three wizards were already reaching the alley entrance.

Another second too late, and he'd have gotten incinerated -- and worse, probably seen it coming thanks to his Sight. Heart racing, he glanced down the alley for a way out. It was one long path wide enough for two people standing shoulder to shoulder. Or one fireball. *Great*, he thought. *I'm gonna get scorched by some freaking Potterheads.*

The three wizards rounded the corner and stopped. Their lanky leader held a baseball-sized flame in one hand, tossing it and catching it casually. His grin should have been covered in flies for all the shit it was eating. Adam rolled up his sleeves slowly, ignoring the little voice in the back of his head screaming for him to haul ass. Lanky's two buddies gawked at Adam's bare arms, but Lanky raised his hands again. The fireball swelled and screamed forward.

Adam screamed, reflexively blocking the fireball with his hands, as if it were a punch, though that same little voice told him it wouldn't be enough, not yet. By the time the fireball reached him, Adam couldn't hear anything but the roaring of the flames.

The explosion launched him off his feet. Adam had been burned before and knew that first there'd be a cold feeling, like dipping a hand into a bucket of ice water, before he ever felt the burn. But that's not what hurt first. It was his head. He screamed, clawing at his scalp, as the pain threatened to split his head in half. He was looking at the sky. It was gray -- all clouds. He heard shouting. Not just him. His left hand felt cold. More screaming. God, he was hungry.

A body thumped down to the ground beside him with a hollow knock of a skull bouncing off stone. The pain in his head died down enough for him to stop screaming, but that only made room for the searing pain in his left hand. Adam coughed, then sat up and blinked away the tears in his eyes. There were no colors swirling in his vision. But he didn't need his Sight to make out what was happening.

The body that had dropped beside him belonged to one of Lanky's stooges. Adam glanced at his hand briefly and noticing the red and black and blisters, he quickly looked away and focused on the entrance of the alley.

The woman wore a black cloak, a sleeveless cloak. She kept her silver hair pulled back in a ponytail, and each arm was covered with a large tattoos of the same animal that Adam couldn't recognize, but if he had to guess, they were some sort of tiger-bear? A Tibear?

What he could recognize was the sight of someone getting their ass handed to them. Lanky's ass, to be specific. *Good*, Adam thought. *At least if I die, it'll be to a total babe.*

And with that, Adam dropped back and didn't even feel the back of his head bouncing off the cobblestone. He welcomed the darkness.
