The cave was empty. Of course, Jeorge had been expecting as much. The dragon the village called Nox would never curl up and slumber in some hole. Dragons were prideful, conceited creatures. No, Jeorge knew exactly where to find the scaled tyrant, the inhuman creature that destroyed his life. That killed his son.

Now, if Jeorge could just find a way to get around the two guards posted at the mouth of the cavern...

They were fine boys, he reckoned. Elas and Thum weren't rougher than necessary when hauling Jeorge out of Olivan's tavern. So he wouldn't kill them. *The only one that dies today*, Jeorge thought to himself. *Is the dragon*.

But that still left the problem of escaping the cave without the guards noticing. He had to get to the lord's manor by nightfall. No other way about it. If he missed his chance, it was all over. 

Gods. If only he could have a drink. His hands started trembling. It's only been a day since his last one. It was getting worse. Jeorge closed his eyes and filled his belly with air. In and out. Over and over, fighting his nerves back down. The cave smelled of damp and moss and the air was cool, salty even.

Jeorge opened his eyes. That meant the cave must lead to the shore. The entrance was tucked inland, too far to carry the salty breeze. If he found his way to the shore and doubled back around, he could make it by nightfall. But there'd be no rest. And he'd have to cut across the borderlands ... where his son-- 

It was settled. 

Jeorge glanced back at the entrance one last time. "Grape Knight, huh?" he said to himself. "I'll show you Grape Knight."

\*\*\*

Jeorge burned most of his endurance sprinting across the borderlands. The cave spat him out near a goat path that led back inland. The path opened into a small corner of the border that was guarded by the dragon lord's men. He'd kept low, crouched, constantly moving. The thirst was enough to drive empty a lake, and his hands kept bloody trembling, but he pushed on. Soon, the craggy border gave way to wood and a road. 

By then, the New Moon was a dark smudge in the night sky. It'd taken Jeorge quite some time to figure out the dragon lord's rhythm. Yes, he raided the countryside every few months, whenever he pleased. But there was one day he never came. The night of the New Moon. But to confirm it? He had to keep track. Thirty or so days in a month, which meant twenty nine-ish days where he could come. Two months on average per day. Twelve months in a year. It wasn't perfect, but after five years -- five years of keeping track, the pattern was there. It was clear. 

The dragon lord couldn't change out of human form on the night of the New Moon. 

Jeorge threw himself into another mull bush as hooves thundered back down the road behind him. Another patrol. There'd be more sentries the closer he got. Which gave him an idea.

With the patrol gone, he didn't go back on the road. He cut through the woods, stumbling over roots and ducking under branches. They'd see him coming from the road. But from the woods? That'd give him the cover he needed. All he needed was to find a lone guard. He could work with two. But one ... just one.

\*\*\*

Jeorge leapt out of the woods and pounced on top of a pair of guards. They were lightly armored, so the weight of Jeorge's armor crumbled them both. Of course, he too felt the weight of the fall.

Jeorge rolled off the two and using what little strength he had left, punched the bigger guard square in the face. Something shifted under his strike, possible the man's jaw, and the guard went still. The punch's momentum carried Jeorge forward and he rolled back on top of the smaller guard -- who started shouting. 

Jeorge panicked and quickly shoved his gauntleted fingers in the man's mouth. 

"Quiet, quiet," he hissed. "I ain't gonna kill ya."

The guard fought Jeorge, punching and pushing. But Jeorge had his jaw in a tight grip and would not let go. He just needed to catch his breath long enough to put the man down and take his uniform. But fatigue was catching up with him. His body ached, his lungs burned, and he would kill, truly murder for a sip of wine. But he'd committed to only one death tonight. So, these men would live.

The guard, having gathered his wits, pulled a dagger from his belt and slashed at Jeorge. But the Grape Knight's armor caught most of it, pinging and bouncing the attacks. That was until the guard stabbed Jeorge in the thigh, around the plate.

He wasn't sure if it was good or bad that he didn't register the pain. The guard gave him a look of surprise when Jeorge didn't react to the stab, though it was hard to tell with a metal gauntlet jammed down his throat. With that, Jeorge regained enough of his energy to slam the guard's head down on the packed earth, once, twice, and a final time. He stopped fighting.

Jeorge quickly shed his own armor and put on the smaller guard's armor and black tabard.

If any of the patrols stopped Jeorge, there wasn't much he could say to keep his cover. So he marched outside the manor, mostly avoiding the liveried guards, until he reached the giant windows showing a candle lit bedroom that glittered. Gold. So much gold. 

Jeorge tucked himself into the bushes beneath the window. Roses. It must have been the middle of the night. Sleep tugged at his eyes, pulling them down. But he fought. His whole body trembled, screaming for a drop of wine, a sniff of brandy. He fought. He looked down at the uniform he wore and the flood of memories he'd been keeping dammed up for years finally burst through. Gain. He remembered Gain proudly showing off his uniform to him and his mother before he went off to serve on the borderlands. Before he died. Jeorge was crying now, silently. And he fought.

Above him, there was noise coming from the room. Then the windows opened. A slithering, nasally voice said, "Well then remind them of their lord's generosity. If we're going to take back the olive fields from that gnat, Xoren, then we're going to need more recruits. Understood?"

Another voice affirmed and then silence. 

One by one, candles were snuffed out, weakening the light pouring out of the window, until Jeorge was cast in darkness.

He waited. Waited. For so long, he'd waited. Ten, twenty minutes -- and he rose. He peeked into the room. There was a lump under the covers of the bed. 

Jeorge removed his armor, slowly, carefully. He strapped his sword to his back and lifted himself up on the window ledge, climbed inside.

Jeorge padded over to the sleeping lord, stood over him, drew his sword.

"So, Xoren has made his move, has he," said a voice. It didn't come from the shape on the bed. It came from behind Jeorge.

Maybe it was the shock, maybe it was being so close to his goal, the fury of years finally unbottled, but whatever strength Jeorge had recovered evaporated. He dropped to one knee. And as he dropped, a figure toppled over him. The figure was was Lord Strazian. He was a holding a dagger, and, sticking out of his chest, was Jeorge's sword.

Smoke and red light leaked out of the wound. His skin began to darken and harden. 

No time to waste. Jeorge pulled his sword and swung down. 

It was done.

The dragon was dead.
