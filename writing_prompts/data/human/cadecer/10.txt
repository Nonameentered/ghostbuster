Cid crept along the half-collapsed house in a crouch, his boots scraping the dry, cracked ground. He held Salamander down at his waist, the long, crimson blade slightly steaming. The runesword was nothing fancy to look at, though the crystal blade was forged with such care that it sat perfectly balanced in his grip. No backdraft from the heat thanks to the new-style crossguards. Back in his day, magic knights simply bared the burns. Still, this new sword fit his hands like it was meant to be there. 

The one-story house was done, the wood rotted with time, propped up by a few stubborn beams. It smelled of age. Even termites had given up on this wood long ago.

Cid peeked around the crumbling plaster, scanning the empty village. White balls of lifelight hovered in his vision, glowing through buildings to highlight nearby lifeforms, a result of his Martial Prowess. Focusing his spiritual energy into his eyes did that; his Sight let him see the location of sources of life, then Press their minds if he wanted. His will against their will. If he was much stronger, they'd fall unconscious. If they were stronger, he'd get one nasty migraine. Worse case, he'd end up taking a nap too.

In this case, however, he didn't Press. He just watched the lights to see if any them were moving. None of them were. Lights at waist-height, softy pulsing in time with heart beats, smaller lights belonging to animals down at ground level, or small, faint lifelights out in the woods surrounding the village—all were as motionless as the old tree stump sticking out of the ground to his left.

Wary, he too remained still. Spiritual energy continued to flow warmly through him, and so—as a precaution—he carefully Coated his entire body with the energy, weakening his Sight. It was the first technique he'd mastered as a squire; he didn't Coat his runesword, but created a sort of invisible mail around himself. Any strike or spell that came at him would be blocked by his defenses.

It was far from foolproof; he couldn't keep that sort of protection up forever, not at his age. Arrows would bounce off, as if hitting a brick wall, and spells would react much in the same way. But once he'd exhausted himself, no more protection. It had saved his life back during the Third Border War, when he was a young man. He wasn't even sure how he awakened it; Prowess was often an instinctive thing for him. At his height, he even managed to filter the air he breathed without accidentally Coat his surroundings. 

That done, he continued around the house—still watching the now fainter lifelights to make sure nobody was sneaking up on him. Goldmar had once been a prosperous village. That had been twenty years back. Then a den of goblins had popped up nearby. Things hadn't gone well since then.

Today, the dead town seemed completely empty, though he knew it wasn't. Cid had come here hunting a demon. Unfortunately, he wasn't the only one.

He padded around the house and into the middle of the street, feet grinding cracked dirt. Crouching low, he ran in a squat over to the side of the old blacksmith's forge. His leathers were terrible dusty, but well sewn; a leather vest, a good pair of boots, tough woolen breeches, and linen small clothes made with comfort in mind. He had cultivated a look that appeared more appropriate on a woodsman, as if he were planning to clear a stretch of trees back in the Hinterlands than scrambling through a dead town on the Frontier hunting a demon. Completing his outfit, he wore a black mantle with the Sword and Crown emblem of the Imperial Magic Knights, mostly to keep his neck warm.

A sound; someone stepped on a board across the street, making it creak. It was so faint, he almost missed it. Cid reacted immediately, flooding his eyes with spiritual energy and weakening his defenses. He Pressed against the lifelight in the building across the street just as the first arrow pierced one of the wooden posts holding up the blacksmith's roof.

His sudden Press caused the lifelight to flicker in the distance; a groan echoed through the empty streets. His Press returned sensations belonging to his target; wild, hungry, instinctual sensation. Another white lifelight flickered into existence for an eyeblink—an assassin, jumping in and out of hiding. As Cid trundled out of the side of the blacksmith's shack, a second arrow bit into the wood. This one came close, but missed him by a few hands.

Breathing calmly, he raised Salamander and focused on the old house across the street, where the arrows had come from. The house was small and half-collapsed, capable of hiding archers.

Cid cut the air, then Coated himself, guarding against the heat and debris of his attack. He wasn't using some third-tier runesword; he needed something stronger.

The flames that erupted from the sword solidified for a moment into a long blade that followed Cid's horizontal slash, and the sword's first-tier runes created flames so hot they cut through the old wood like a heated dagger through lard. The two lifelights winked out as the house collapsed. Cid walked out slowly, brushing the dust from his clothing. At that moment another arrow whistled through the air.

He cursed, reflexively Coating himself with spiritual energy, though his body told him he'd exerted himself too much, too fast. By the time he heard the arrow, it was too late for Coating to protect him completely.

This time he stumbled back as the arrow bit into his left leather vest. Not too deep. His Coating still managed to rob the arrow of most of its force, and if his Prowess couldn't protect him completely, that's what the leather was for. He grunted as he stumbled and raised his sword, dust sticking to the sweat on his hand. He searched frantically for the one who'd fired at him. They'd struck true. Maybe if he Coated himself completely—

A bestial scream tore through the air as a pillar of light erupted from behind the blacksmith's shop. Cid blinked, then raised his sword to waist level and crept around the building again, keeping low for cover. He kept an eye on the faint lifelights. They could warn him if someone got close, but only if he sacrificed his defenses for maximum visibility.

The scream that had come with the pillar of light didn't have a lifelight anymore. However, another brilliant ball of molten white flames moved along the back of the forge. Far too bright to Press against. Cid shifted into a quick-strike stance, readying himself to cut the sky in half if necessary as the massive lifelight appeared around the side of the building and skipped toward him.

The girl wore a white dress, lousy with frills at the bottom. She kept her silver hair pulled back in two tails, and wore a tiara and a dark crystal around her neck, with heeled boots on her feet. She had a pinched face. A child's face, with eyes that often widened for no reason at all.

Cid heaved a sigh of annoyance and lowered his sword. "Aura..."
