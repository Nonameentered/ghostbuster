Konar had only ever raised beasts.

It was forbidden by the village elders to raise a human from the dead. Profane. But there were no more elders. There was no village. And, no one ever figured out how to raise a human.

But grief can make people do incredible, miraculous things. Profane things. Though to Konar, the paladins that purged his village were no more human than the oxen and hounds he'd raised as an apprentice -- undead beasts of burden. Konar had plenty of work for in store for his revenant.

As Konar walked through the scorched remains of Shadegulch, he wasn't sure if it was wood or bone crunching beneath his boots. Was it old man Buie's front door or his ribs? There was no way to know for certain.

But when he stomped down on something curved and metallic, there was no question as to the identity of its owner.

It was one of them.

Konar dropped his bag and knelt down in the dirt. He cleared away the ash and detritus covering the half-buried piece of armor. Beneath it would be more. But he wasn't going to have to dig the body up himself, not after he was done.

Each candle from his bag was worth enough dullings to feed him for weeks. He'd spent many sleepless nights, curled into a ball in some stranger's barn as his stomach threatened to eat itself, clutching the candles to his chest. There were times when his hunger almost won. But there was no ritual without ritual candles.

Preparations complete, Konar banged on a small gourd drum and began his new chant.

*Death is only but a start*

*You're journey's just begun*

*There is no night without the dawn*

*You're journey's just begun*

*Accept my gift, a second chance*

*You're journey's just begun*

*Now rise and heed my beck and call*

*You're journey's just begun*

Sweat dripped down Konar's face as he repeated his chant, over and over. Usually, there would have been a tugging sensation pulling at his heart. It was how the chant worked. A bit of Konar's soul poured into the dead beast, animating it. But there was no tugging.

The armor did not move.

"No," Konar whispered. "This has to work."

He'd nearly starved gathering the reagents. He'd bribed soldiers to grant him passage into the Crescent Valley, to his home. He'd hunted down survivors of the purges, anyone who knew just a bit more about necromancy than him -- and begged, pleaded, bargained for their secrets. All for this night. All for his chance at vengeance.

Konar stared up at the new moon -- the night where death magic was strongest.

He would not give up.

"Death!" he shouted. "Hear me. I am your disciple, your kin. Please, please, hear me. I have no one left. I can't--I can't do this alone. Grant me your blessing--" He pressed his palm against the cool steel breastplate, and whispered. "Please. Arise."

A gauntleted fist burst through the ground. Then another. It began digging itself free.

Konar tumbled backward, terrified but feeling himself smile through the fear.

The paladin's corpse sat up. Her face was half-rotted. Where her left eye and cheek should have been, there was only dirt-covered bone. But most of her was there, under the mail and plate. Yes. She would do.

She started screaming.

Konar screamed.

They both screamed under the moonless night.

"Why are you yelling!" Konar demanded.

"Because I was dead!"

"Well stop it!"

The paladin went silent.

"G-good," he said, feigning the confidence of a master summoner. This had been what he wanted, what he'd prepared for. But theory was one thing. Actually raising a human corpse, a revenant was supposed to be ... impossible. "My name is Konar," he said. "I'm your master."

The paladin's one milky eye blinked slowly and seemed to focus on Konar. Blinking, it nodded.

*Good*. *It's under my control. This is good.*

"What is your name?"

The paladin coughed and chunks of dirt flew out of its mouth. The paladin reached for its side and pulled a torn, dirty handkerchief and wiped its lips.

Then, it spoke. "My name is Octavia. I am a paladin of the First Dawn, and you are in danger, Konar Rane. I have seen the future, and they are coming for you. We must hurry."

Konar blinked at the revenant. This was not what he was expecting. "Uh--wait. Who is coming?"

The revenant rose from the hole in the dirt, wiped at her armor, and when she found her sword missing from her side, grimaced. "Former Sword Saint of the First Dawn, Sir Milos Nightbane. The strongest paladin to have ever lived, and also, a revenant ...  like me."
