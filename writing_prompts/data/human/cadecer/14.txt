Now, I've woken up in strange places. Alleys, churches, cargo hold on a steamer. Always with a splitting headache and a lass' name still fresh on my lips. But this was the first time I'd woken up in a wooden box. My experience spared me the shock of my situation. More than anything, I was annoyed. Couldn't they have at least sanded down the surfaces? What sort of driftwood did they cobble together for my coffin--

Right. I died. At least, it felt like it. My whole body was one big charlie horse. I couldn't move but by body writhed and fidgeted against the rough surface of the coffin. My mouth was dryer than a bucket of sand and there was a high-pitched ringing in my ears, but nothing hurt, not even the spasms. That worried me.

I sighed. Aisling was a vampire. There was no mistaking those fangs. Those eyes. The Byrne clan are no strangers to the creatures of the night. Since the time of Cuchulain did our family fight the forces of the endless night. At least, we used to.

My Da was a cooper by trade and a screaming good one to boot. My Ma had delivered more babies in all of County Cork than the gathering of midwives combined. Neither of them hunted monsters. Angela wants to marry one of those Oxford fellows she keeps going on about and retire to London. Siobhan has no delusions about her situation and is already working at the textile mill. And Tommy. Well, he and I have got our own thing going on at the factory. None of it involves killing vampires. Where would one even start?

It didn't matter, because I was leaving. I survived that woman, monster, for a reason. Whatever that reason may be, it sure as hell didn't involve getting mixed up with Aisling ever again.

Now, all I had to do was get out of this box.

I tried taking a deep breath to focus on moving my arms, and I realized I wasn't breathing. Had I been holding my breath? I inhaled and focused on my fingers. *Curl into fists*, I thought. *Feel your fingers, feel your body.*

A tingle. In my left ring finger. I concentrated again, willing my awareness into my fingers and suddenly pain jolted up my arms--just for a moment--and I was aware of my fists, curled so tight my nails were digging into my palms, and those fists were connected to my flexing forearms by stiff wrists. Slowly, awareness washed through the rest of my body in a wave of pain followed by relief.

Once I could wiggle my little toes, I struck out against the coffin with all four limbs like spreading into a snow angel. The box exploded around me.

I sat up under a shower of splinters and wood chips in a cold room. Around me other bodies lay dead on wooden tables under often bloodied white sheets. I was naked under a similar sheet and there was a Y-shaped cut going down from my collar bones to my belly button stitched up like a Christmas roast. Still, no pain.

Something made a noise like a whimper. When I heard that noise, it was like the world came to life for the first time.

There were only two weak lamps lighting the entire morgue, hardly enough to make out letters a hand away from your face. In in instant, it was like I was standing out in a field under a midday sun. The slightest breeze was a brush against my skin. The acrid taste of embalming fluid flooded my awareness and I started spitting despite my cotton-dry mouth. But that whimper snapped my head up, facing the direction of the sound. I sniffed the air and caught several things, decay, mold, old water, blood, steel, sweat, and... fear. Oh, it was like honey cakes and whiskey, sweet and loud and mouth watering.

He stood up from under a broken plank of cedar, the wood smell fresh in my nostrils. And his fear. He was a round little man in a white coat covered in old blood stains. The wisp of black hair on top of his head was only highlighted by his wild, gray-streaked beard.

There was a sound, a steady thumping. Not my heart. I don't think it was beating. No. It was coming from him. If I squinted, I could make out a red line glowing in the side of his neck. It was only partially covered by the beard. Easy enough to access--

I stopped. I was standing, naked. Halfway to the man. What was I about to do? I had to escape. Get away from him, from everyone.

I tried sucking in a breath and couldn't. I was still holding the one I'd inhaled earlier. I hadn't even noticed. Not bothering with breathing anymore, I grabbed one of the sheets, wrapped myself decent as best I could, and ran out of the building and headed for the only place I could. Home.
