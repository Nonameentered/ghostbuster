A marriage built on secrets can bear no weight. 

That was what Tabitha said when I proposed. I wasn't sure if it was a no or a maybe or something you say when you're too panicked to think clearly. But she grabbed my hands, pulled me up from my knees, and hugged me tight. The people around us at the Fate Street Cafe, where weâ€™d gone for our first date, started clapping. They thought she'd said yes.

The thing is, she was right. I love Tabitha. Love her so much I went out and bought a ring despite what Guild regulations state about Hunters getting married. But I didn't care. If making Tabitha my bride, me her husband, meant walking away from the only life I've ever known, the only thing I've ever been good at, then so be it. 

There was more to life than hunting witches.

\*\*\*

Tabitha promised her mother would not skin me alive.

So I tried my best to keep a straight face as we crunched along the gravel path from the rental car to the rustic cabin in the middle of the Catskills. Autumn leaves danced in the breeze, chilly enough to bite through denim.

"Do you smell that?" I asked Tabitha.

"No," she said. "What is it?"

"Smells like cat piss."

Tabitha shrugged. I let it go. Maybe there was a colony of strays nearby. The place wasn't too far from town. 

Reaching up to the lion-faced knocker, I closed my eyes and blew out a shaky breath.

A hand rested on mine. Tabitha. 

"She's gonna love you," she said, smiling that smile that always seemed to steady my nerves. 

I nodded and slammed the knocker once, twice -- the door swung open.

"Tabby!" the little woman screamed.

"Mama!" Tabitha shrieked back.

I froze in place. There are three sure signs that you're dealing with a witch -- facial warts, an abundance of cats, and a collection of cauldrons. Tabitha's mother had all three. Warts crowded on her crooked nose and cleft chin. The scent of cat piss punched my nose. Cauldrons in all different sizes hung around the fireplace with one on the fire, bubbling, boiling. 

I was in trouble.

"Is this the rogue that stole my little Tabby's heart?" the witch asked, fists on hips. "Well, don't just stand there." She held out her hand as if expecting a kiss. 

"Mother!" Tabitha said. She pushed her way, dragging her mother inside.

My heart pounded against the inside of my chest. I gripped the doorway to steady myself. On her finger. A rat skull. A ring made from a rat's skull. She wasn't some hedge witch. Tabitha's mother was one of the Seven Sisters. No one else would *dare* wear that ring. No one.

"Carl!" Tabitha shouted from inside the cabin. "You coming?"

Tabitha. Was she a witch too? But she hated anything related to magic. She didn't even like astrology, let alone rituals and spells. But her mother was of the Seven--

A hand gripped mine. It wasn't Tabitha's.

"You and I have got much to discuss, boy," Tabitha's mother whispered. "After my Tabby speaks her mind. After. Understood?"

Whatever shred of courage left in me, mostly from years of training, stilled my nerves enough for me to speak without trembling, thank god. 

"I am here for Tabitha," I said. "Nothing else. No one else."

Matilda stared long and hard and I stared right back in her eyes. She smiled. 

To look someone in the eyes was to look into their soul. That's what poets say. But what they don't know is that when staring into the eyes of someone with Power, with a capital P, means literally staring at their soul. Everything they are, have been, and will be. Of course, it works both ways. 

I stared into one of the Seven's soul, she stared right back.

I could not tell you how much time passed. I watched a girl be born in a barn. The midwife cried. The mother pleaded, covering her newborn child. The doors burst open and villagers poured in. Torches. Pitchforks. They came for the child. The child did not oblige. A girl, no older than ten, runs through a field. Her mother watches from the window of their modest cabin. An arrow bites into the grass by the girl's feet. Men with daggers and swords run at her. They would not survive. A woman stands against six like her. The six wanted her child. No. They could not have her. They would not have her daughter. A crone sits alone. Waiting. Always waiting. A knock at the door. Two. She smiles.

On and on it went. The girl became a woman. The woman become a mother. The mother became a crone. The crone became a girl. The girl became a woman... Over and over and over and--

I gasped. I was standing in the doorway, clutching it so hard my nails dug into the wood. Matilda still had her hand on mine. She was sweating. So was I.

Tabitha appeared behind her mother. 

"Hey, you two," she said, grinning. "I put on some tea. Everything alright?"

"Yes," I said, still looking at Matilda Ghilhane, one of the Seven Sisters and proud witch. "I was just taking a moment to pay my respects. For your father."

"Yes," said Matilda. "Carl is quite the honorable young man. Honorable indeed." She pulled me inside the cabin with surprising strength. "No secrets between us."

"No secrets," I repeated.

There was more to life than hunting witches. You could do something hard. Like, earning your mother-in-law's respect.
