Everyone hated Jeorge -- except for Olivan, the tavern keep. Jeorge was his best customer.

Now, there were plenty of drunks in Dimbrook. But they were among us. A part of the community. You can't smash a tankard over the thatcher's head and expect him to fix the leak in your roof the next day. Drink your drink. Talk your talk. But respect your neighbor. As far as I'm concerned, them's the only rules to a drunkard's life.

But Jeorge? He bade no rules.

He was always in your ear, breath damn near flammable, giving ya a tongue lashing about whatever had his balls in a twist that day. How the well was tainted with mind control potion, how there used to be an eighth day in the week called Shnoosday, how Lord Strazian was actually a dragon disguised as a man. On and on.

You do what you can with men like that. Nod. Grunt. Walk away. Can't make sense out of nonsense. Maybe you toss them a coin so they can, hopefully, fill their belly with anything other than wine.

Jeorge wasn't always a drunk. But after his son, Gain, died in the last border skirmish against Lord Xoren, a gloom came over the man. Without his son's extra hands, he had to sell his failing apple orchard to Lord Strazian for a pittance of its worth. Then his wife left him for the thatcher, and, well -- the only thing Jeorge had left was the drink. That would never leave him. Even if it should.

Really, what ol' Jeorge needed was help. But like my da used to say, "You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it stop drinking brandy. That's up to the horse." He wasn't the best with words -- better with roofs -- but that didn't make them less true.

Was Jeorge a nuisance? Yes. Did he reek of sick and piss? You bet. Was he harmless? Most of the time. Really, if you couldn't dodge a swing from a man as drunk as Jeorge, that said more about you than it did him. But one day, Jeorge wasn't so harmless.

I think he'd had enough of people ignoring his prognostications of doom. Let a man shout into the void long enough, he'll start taking action.

And so, Jeorge burned the well.

The man dumped a whole barrel of oil in there and dropped a lantern. The explosion shook the entire village, lit up the night sky with a great ball of fire shooting up out of the ruined well. We thought Nox had come to raze the village, but no -- it was Jeorge. As the guard took him away, he shouted that he'd done it for us. That it was to free us from the lord's influence. That mind potion nonsense again.

And even though half the village frothed at the mouth for Jeorge's execution, to see him swing from a tree, the mayor was a law-abiding man. And the Lord Strazian's law was clear. No man hangs for their crimes. Instead, they're put to work or are recruited into the country lord's army. Fodder for the front.

I don't think the mayor had the heart to send ol' Jeorge off to die breaking rocks or skewered on some soldier's spear on the borderlands -- to die like his son did. I think the mayor sent Jeorge to slay Nox as an act of mercy, you see.

We called the dragon Nox because we weren't sure of the dragon's true name. And because Nox had black scales that covered its body, and black smoke preceded and followed its raids on the country side. For the most part, it left us alone, and we left it alone. But every couple of of months, ol' Nox would claw out from its cave up in the north and snatch up a few sheep, burn a couple of barns.

I didn't fear Nox. I'd heard of it since I was a boy. Hard to fear something you understand. But would I ever go out and try to slay it? Gods no. I was perfectly happy patching up leaky roofs, thank you very much.

But Jeorge? Well, he had a choice to make. Die in service to Lord Strazian or slay Nox.

The morning Jeorge set out on his quest, most of us gathered around the green lawn, in the heart of the village. We watched as the smithy made faces while strapping on some beat up old plate around Jeorge's haggard body. No mail for the would-be dragon slayer. Just his torn, stained clothes. The helmet looked more like a bucket than a piece of armor, and it sat on his bushy head cocked to the side. But in the end, Jeorge the drunk stood resplendent -- the Grape Knight, we called him.

He set off, marching north, accompanied by two of the village guard -- I assume to make sure he didn't run off. The guards returned as the sunset and confirmed that Jeorge ran into Nox's cave. And when he didn't come out, they waited and waited, and finally, returned. I didn't sleep well that night. It was too quiet.

The next day, two great shocks struck Dimbrook.

First, we learned that Lord Strazian was dead. Murdered in his bed. And, while the missives didn't say, the messenger carrying the news told us that the killer took the lord's head with him.

The second shock came when Jeorge returned -- not empty handed. He trudged into the village, dragging what looked like a black boulder behind with with several ropes wrapped around himself and his burden.

The village was already in an uproar regarding Lord Strazian's death. So everyone took notice as he heaved his way to the green lawn and climbed atop the boulder.

It was then we realized that it wasn't a boulder. It was a head. And it wasn't just any head. It was a dragon's head. The head of Nox.

The mayor ran out to the lawn and demanded Jeorge explain himself. But Jeorge refused to speak until someone brought him a bottle of brandy. Olivan ran to his tavern and returned with two -- one for Jeorge and one for himself. I'm sure the sight of a dragon's severed head frayed the nerves of most of us that day.

Jeorge took a long pull from the bottle, wiped his mouth, and launched into his story.
