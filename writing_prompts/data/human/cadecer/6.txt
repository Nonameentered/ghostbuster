"Where are we?" John asked. "What is this?"

"No need to dread," Professor Tilinghast said and turned on the flashlight on his hand terminal. "Where merely in the heart of the unknowable."

"What are you talking about? We're in the lab, doc."

But they weren't. They were in a forest clearing. Dead, leafless trees loomed over them, gnarled and cracked and reaching. Not a single breeze, the air stiller than a corpse. It was dark. No stars. And the moon was a black pit in the night's sky, giving no light. Yet he could see.

But what was John looking at exactly?

Professor Tilinghast's face lit up as he tapped furiously on his hand terminal. Numbers whizzed down his screen, too fast to read. Did this have something to do with the professor's machine?

"Our exit is due North East," the professor said, still looking down. "We need to hurry. Who knows what's out here."

"I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what the hell happened!"

Normally, the professor exuded a twitchy, misunderstood-genius energy that endeared him to you, despite his novel particularity. Once you've taken a trip though a CDC-grade decontamination chamber, working in the professor lab was a lot of fun. He blasted old-school hip hop and had a fridge filled with Red Bull. 

The man that grabbed John by the neck was not endearing. 

"You are coming with me," the professor said with the certainty of 2 + 2 = 4. "We are not supposed to be here, understand?"

John gripped the professor's fingers, prying them open. He gasped. "Let me go."

The professor did, and John dropped to his knees, rubbing his burning throat. 

"Stay close and do not stray off the path," the professor said, already marching off into the woods.

A woman's voice, throaty and dry, whispered into his left ear, so close as if the mouth were touching his lobe. He didn't flinch. He couldn't.

*We were not meant to understand.*

Professor Tilinghast stopped and turned, his face glowing over his hand terminal. "John," he hissed. "Hurry up, god damn it."

"We were not meant to understand," John said, looking off to the side. He repeated the words, faster and faster, until they lost their meaning.

The professor ran down and hauled John up to his feet, but John couldn't stop repeating the words. 

Another voice, a man's, whispered into his right ear. Again, so close John feared turning right lest he come face to face with the speaker. 

*It was a violation of the order of nature.*

"Snap out of it," the professor said, shaking John's shoulders. "Get it the hell together!"

"It was--" John could no longer speak.

\*\*\*

As the black tentacles poured out of John's mouth, Professor Tilinghast's head felt like it was splitting in two. And in one way, it was.

Two realities existed in his mind. 

One where he spent thirteen years working on his drive, a drive that could send shuttles faster than light, and after all those  years toiling away, he finally cracked the code. 

And the other reality is one where a grad student named John Cerfemelle had worked with him for the past two years.

But there was no John. Never was.

The massive, gelatinous thing quivering before Tilinghast blinked it countless eyes and whipped its tentacles through the stale, windless air.

A voice echoed through his mind, voices rather. Three of them, different sexes and ages but in perfect sync.

*Forbidden.*

Tilinghast did not scream. He could no longer speak.
