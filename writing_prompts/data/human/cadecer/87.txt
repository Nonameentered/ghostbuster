Thank you so much! This was a challenging exercise because I wanted to try to fit a romance in such a small space. I ended up using a different story as a base to help me with the structure, but Leto and Alma totally came to life as I was writing this. \[yes, the princess' name is Alma, though I failed to mention it in the story\]
