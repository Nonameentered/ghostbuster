You've barely survived a car accident with your legs mangled. A renowned doctor comes to you with a proposal to replace your legs with arms from a late donor in a similar accident to create the first 4 armed person.
The doctor stumbled his way in and dropped his clipboard. Picking it up and holding it upside down, the man quickly tried to scan the paper and look intelligent, perhaps to save face, before glancing over the state of my injuries. He spoke with a excited accent. 'Hi, Everybody! We's gon na see what we can do about them ahms.' He peered over at my shoulder sockets and scratched at his fuzzy chin. 

'Okay! How would you like to have two arms?' He asked, pointing his pen into his chin. 

'I... yes, I'd like my arms back.' I responded. 

'Okay! What about four?' 

'Are you a real doctor..?'
