[Part 1 of 2]

“They had my wallet. Why the hell would they keep kicking me after that? Bunch of hooligans, damn it, where are my keys?” Dave dug through his pocket, trying to find his keys, after a bit of fidgeting he fished them out, only to watch as they clattered against the concrete, earning a groan from the man. He tried to bend down with his crutches only to trip and hit the door, creating a loud bang that caught the attention of the gorgon regular that had been patiently waiting for the bar to open.

 

“Are you alright? Why are you carrying those wooden poles with you? Is this another human festivity of yours?” Melis asked, helping him stand upright again.

 

“Oh, It’s to help me walk. I got attacked last night. Bunch of thugs stole my wallet and gave me a bit of a kicking. Don’t worry, I think my ego is more broken than my body.” Dave gave a chuckle as he unlocked the front door, only to turn back and see the left eye of the gorgon twitching. Her makeup running down her face, revealing the scaley skin underneath as a few snakeheads emerged from her long black hair.

 

“Who… did it? Where do they live? Which organs of theirs do you want?”

 

“Huh? Easy Melis, I promise you I’m fine. These things happen. There’s no need to go out and seek vengeance for my sake. Maybe they just needed the money more than I did.”

 

“More than you? You can barely afford to keep the lights on. Can you even afford to pay the rent this month?”

 

“It’s fine. I can take a loan or something, right? Why don’t you just come in and have a drink, help me earn some money?” Dave knew he messed up. He had planned to keep the attack to himself, but it was the first time anyone had shown any concern for him since they jumped him, and he felt ready to unload everything onto the first person who even remotely cared.

 

“You shouldn’t have to take a loan. They wronged you. Why should you have to be the bigger man? You should let me kill them in your name.”

 

“That’s not how things work. I don’t want you getting hurt trying to help me, ok? I opened this bar up because my grandfather believed that everyone should have a safe place to drink, even those that aren’t human. Please don’t do anything for my sake. Seeing one of my regulars get hurt would be far more painful than a broken leg.”

Melis felt her heart flutter, the monster forgetting all about her plan to capture these hooligans, too moved by his words. She was even prepared to let the attack slide until she watched him stumble through the doorway, letting out a groan of pain that immediately snapped her back to her thoughts of revenge.

“Dave, you look nice today.” She said, earning a strange look from the man.

 

“Really? Is a cast fashionable now?” He laughed, making his way into the bar.

 

“Oh, I just meant in general. Did that help with your ego? If not, I have a notepad of compliments for humans. Would you like to hear some?”

 

“It’s not much of a compliment when you admit you’re just saying it out of pity, but I appreciate the thought. Can you keep this incident to yourself? I don’t want things to get crazy.”

 

”Of course, I won’t utter a word.”

 

Melis ordered her usual absinthe shot with a sugar cube, only really liking the drink because of its greenish color. She swirled the shot as the regulars made their way into the bar, the chaotic mashing of monsters filling it up with a lively atmosphere. A few regulars enquired about his injury, but Dave just brushed it off, saying it was due to him lifting an overly heavy box.

 

The night continued to pass until Dave stepped to the bathroom, allowing Melis her chance to enact her plan. She held up her notepad to the demonic gentlemen next to her. The man wearing deep red shades with a white beard that hung to his chest. His devilish black suit slick against his thin form. At first, he didn’t notice the notepad, too absorbed in his bloody Mary until a snake head rammed into his shoulder, causing him to glance her way. He adjusted his glasses before screwing up his face.

 

“Dave, I don’t know how to tell you this, but I-“ Devi tried to read the message out only for Melis to pull it back, awkwardly flipped through the pages of compliments before finding the message she had written. She presented it once again and he read through it. “Dave was attacked by a bunch of murderers who stole all his money and broke his leg.” Melis wrote, adding a few exaggerations into the story.

 

Everyone went silent as the regulars turned to face Devi. The demon’s hand shaking as he reached for his glasses, sliding them off to flash his red eyes. The nails on his fingers growing into sharp claws that nearly dug their way into the counter of the bar.

 

“Is this true?” Was all he said, trying his best to keep his composure as the other regulars circled the two.

Melis and her small snake heads only nodded in response, each moving in unison as they watched the demon stand up from the bar, exhaling a breath of booze and fire.

 

“Those bastards. They think they can kill my bartender. That does it. All of them are going straight to the deepest pits of hell. I will torment each one until this bar is paid off in its entirety.”

 

A hand landed on the shoulder of Devi. The fluffy grey hand belonging to a werewolf named Kila. The man flashed his canines before shoving Devi back onto his barstool. His powerful touch nearly throwing the demon through it. His broad chest puffing, working himself into a rage.

 

“I’ll kill them. I have a better sense of smell, so I’ll be able to find them in no time. If anyone should kill them, it should be his most loyal regular.”

 

“Most loyal? I always arrive here first. If anything, I should be the one to kill them. I didn’t know it was a contest for his affection.” Melis interrupted, the three having a standoff. Each getting ready for a fight, only for the entrance of the bar to open, despite no one being there.

 

“SUZY, DON’T YOU DARE TRY TO SNEAK OFF. I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO SEE YOU BUT I CAN STILL SEE THE DOOR.” Devi shouted, catching the ghost woman sneaking out for revenge.

 

“I’m the only person who can kill them without getting caught. If you get caught because of one of your demonic rampages, it will make us all look bad. You will cause Dave even more trouble.”

 

“Amateurs. Are you forgetting which of us was an assassin for thousands of years? Let a professional handle this.” Victor said, the vampire swinging a fork around in his hands, making a few stab gestures at the air.

“An Assassin? More like An Ass-Ass… in? You’re not even a good assassin. If you didn’t have your healing, you would be dead. Let an actual beast handle this.” Kali said, only for the blonde-haired vampire to float over to the group, poking the end of his fork into the chest of the werewolf.

 

“Are you trying to anger me, beast?”
