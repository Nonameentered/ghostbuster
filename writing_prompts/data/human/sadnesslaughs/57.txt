[Part 1 of 2]

“This is stupid. Are you sure you aren’t going senile, granddad?” Chuck watched as his eighty-year-old grandfather wrestled with a strange clown statue, knocking it to the floor before he spat in its face.

 

“Where are you hiding it? I know you have it. If you don’t tell me where it is, I’ll get my grandson to cut off your nose. How will you honk without that red nose of yours?” Bill stood over the statue, trying to intimidate it. The inanimate statue didn’t change its expression, only giving a family friendly smile that only infuriated Bill further. “Get my swiss army knife, boy.”

 

“IT’S A STATUE, GRANDDAD. Did you really think you would find another human in an abandoned McDonald’s? Why are we even here? You said this place would offer us riches beyond our wildest dreams. What riches are we going to find in a place that’s falling apart?”

 

Bill didn’t turn away from the statue, giving it a nudge with his foot, making sure it wouldn’t run off. When he confirmed the statue was indeed frozen in place, he turned to his grandson, giving him a scoff.

 

“You’re just like your father. You have no sense of adventure. I knew my dear daughter should have married Chad. You know Chad once wrestled a crocodile. A real life Crunch Snapper of a beast.”

 

“And the crocodile killed him. Why are you so impressed by the fact that he fought a crocodile and the crocodile won? Any person can get killed by a crocodile. That’s not a feat of brilliance.” Chuck said as he examined the dusty, grease-stained counter of the establishment.

 

“Really? Any person? Then why haven’t you wrestled a crocodile?”

 

“Because I’m not qualified to do something like that, and I’m also not stupid enough to do such a thing without proper training.”

 

“Ugh, training. Your father was just like that. You know what he told me? Wear a hardhat when you go to a worksite. A hardhat? Back in my day, the only hardhat we needed was a strong noggin.”

 

“Or an empty one.” Chuck said under his breath before he wiped some of the dust from the counter. “So, why are we here?”

“To find the recipe of the gods. A recipe unmatched by any other. A burger that can grant the person who consumes it wealth, fame and power, beyond their wildest dreams.” Bill said, remembering that famous ad that he saw those fifty years ago.

 

“A burger recipe? I drove you ten hours to find a burger recipe? You said this was a matter of life and death!”

  
“Do you see any fountains of youth around? If I don’t eat this burger, I’ll be dead and then you will have to pay the rent. Is that what you want? If not, then shut your tongue flapper and help me look.” Bill began rummaging through the bins, occasionally turning to make sure the statue was still where he left it.

 

“Burgers aren’t really the type of meal that add years to your life.” Chuck commented, only to give up on trying to convince his grandfather. At least the old man seemed to be having fun, even if he dragged them both here for nothing. “Shouldn’t we have gone to a McDonald’s that was still operating?”

 

“No, if it was at one of those establishments, it would have been spotted by now. That means it has to be at one of the abandoned restaurants. I spent the last five months going through whatever building plans and star charts I could get my hands on. All the signs seem to point to the recipe being at this establishment. Well, this or one in Texas.”

 

“Star charts?” Chuck just shook his head, hopping over the counter of the restaurant, searching the rusted metal equipment left behind, looking for any loose scrap pieces of paper.

 

The two were silent, working independently as they turned over the various machines, drawers and even bathrooms of the establishment, looking for a clue but coming up rather empty. Eventually Chuck gave up, sitting himself on the counter as he watched his grandfather return to the statue, giving it another nudge with his slipper.

 

“Where are you hiding it? I know it has to be in here somewhere. Did you check for any loose paper?” Bill asked, taking a few panted breaths as he hunched over.

 

“I did. Only found some documents that would suggest this place owed a lot of money. Nothing about a recipe. It’s ok granddad. Sure, we didn’t find it, but we had a fun trip, right?”

 
Bill only looked down at the clown, slouching his shoulders. “Why isn’t it here? This was supposed to be my legacy to you. Something I could give you to show you I wasn’t an old fool.”

 

“Granddad?” Chuck watched as the hardened man he had known for years sniffled, holding back his emotions as best he could. He didn’t know what to say, only walking over and giving him a comforting pat on his shoulder. “It’s ok. How about we try the one in Texas? You’re not a fool. When my parents died, you took me in. You’re a great man. Now come on, let’s keep searching.”

 

“There’s no point.” Bill wept, his tears hitting the statue underneath. As the tears fell, the statue blinked, moving a gloved hand towards its face, trying to block the waterworks. When Bill noticed this, he grinned. “GIVE ME MY SWISS ARMY KNIFE NOW, I KNEW IT WAS ALIVE.”
