President Theodore Hurston was a man known for his eccentric behavior before the war of 2090. Some considered him a revolutionary, while others considered him a drunken fool whose lecherous attitude would cause their great country a disgrace whenever he got on stage. Both arguments had merit. While he was a drunken fool who often stumbled onto a stage without his shoes, he was also a man who prioritized the health of his citizens. He would often exclaim that “Life is a harp of good vibes, and the doctors pluck the strings.” Something he considered rather profound.

 

Swift action always followed these ramblings. After his speech, legislation passed to improve the working conditions of doctors and nurses. Giving an overhaul to the entire system, ensuring that they had every tool needed to keep the instrument that is the human body singing. That was why he was such a polarizing figure. He had a way of just drawing the attention of the world, some even speculating that his drunken demeanor was all for show, a way to hide his brilliance behind a fake air of ignorance. Outwitting his political adversaries by playing the fool.

 

If that were true, then Theodore may have been even more brilliant than his biggest fans could ever imagine. Because his beer-stained breath certainly played the role exceptionally well, often causing the surrounding people to gag when he staggered by. While some may have considered that gross and undignified, the public loved it. The public weren’t the ones who had to sit with him at meetings or engage with him. All they had to do was watch him ramble. Something that could be done at a safe distance from his toxic breath.

 

It was only a strange coincidence that Theodore was a competent leader, one of those rare events where the stars all align, granting a miracle. For all his public drunkenness and swear filled rants, he had an eye for politics. A way of promising the world to people and delivering a continent. If he couldn’t give you everything, he would make sure you had something. You might not get the cake with him, but you would at least get a slice. Which was more than most politicians could offer.

 

That’s why the opposition hated him. When he got up on stage, they attacked his looks, style, and mannerisms, but they never focused on his policies. To them, the idea that he was even standing on the same stage as them was outrageous. It was like a spider luring a very well-dressed fly into a web, trapping them with his outward appearance, getting them caught in a trap of words, unable to stop themselves from talking about the man.

But, for all the good that he did, his last moments would be one of heartbreak and disaster. It was a typical meeting. Two countries discussing relations and the usual nonsense. In reality, it was just a photo opportunity. Both Theodore and President Mark Lana would stand in front of their country’s flags, shaking hands like proud patriots who just solved world peace. Even though their conversations mainly consisted of talking about their favorite brands of sherry. While their countries were dealing with a tension over missile negotiations, neither man showed any hostility to the other. In fact, Theodore found the man to have a great sense of humor, a top bloke that you would meet down at the pub. That was probably why things went so wrong on that fateful day.

 

With the meeting done, both presidents returned home, ready to go back to their country and say they gave the other leader a stern talking to. It would be the usual affair, only this time when Theodore returned, he had an email from Mark offering to send Theodore his favorite sherry list or anything he needed. It was a generous offer and Theodore couldn’t help but get a little cheeky, replying with “Send nukes.”

The joke may have been older than Theodore himself, but he was certain his political rival would get a kick out of it. Theodore not even noticing the typo before the email went off. Mark may have gotten a kick out of the message even with the typo. Unfortunately, his emails were shared among the higher ups in his party, those that didn’t get the humor in something that sounded like a potential declaration of war.

 

The news of this bomb threat spread quickly throughout their government and by the time word spread to Mark, the message had changed. The message passing through various lips so many times that it didn’t even resemble what was in the email. One of his colleagues grabbing the president, informing him that Theodore has said to send nukes and prepare for a war. Something that wasn’t true in the slightest. With the threat of an approaching war, Mark didn’t have time to go back and check the emails. His soldiers shoving him towards the panic room while his top military minds prepared the strikes.

 

And that was how the war began, not caused by evil dictators or grand ambition, but by a simple typo and an overreaction without assessing the situation.
