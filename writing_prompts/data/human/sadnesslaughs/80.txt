“If you don’t stop these bullets, you won’t have anything left to guard.” I shouted, ducking my head behind the wall, watching as the stray shots broke off pieces of concrete, sending them scattering along the ground.

 

“I told you, I’m just an intern. You were meant to be a simple task to earn some godpoints before the big exam. This isn’t meant to happen.” The angel crouched, trying to avoid the bullets, even though the bullets merely passed through their ethereal form, unable to harm them.

 

“Do something then! Can’t you cast them down to hell or get God to smite them? Anything productive.” I took a breath, peeking around the corner, only to spot the trench-coat wearing man approaching. How long had this sick murderer been following me? With each step, he neared the corner, forcing me to continue running down the street.

 

I used the streetlights as a guide, scanning for any alleyways that I could hide in. As his feet turned the corner, I found my alley, diving into its dark abyss. Silence followed as I crawled my way through the alley, trying to make as little noise as possible.

 

“HE’S GOING TO KILL YOU. HOW AM I GOING TO EXPLAIN THIS TO GOD?” The guardian angel shrieked, fanning their face to calm themselves.

 

“Can’t you call God or another angel? Please, I don’t want to get killed by some murderer.” My crawl came to a halt as I pushed against a metal fence. The fence far too tall for me to climb. As my body collided with the fence, its ghostly rattle shot through the alley, alerting anyone nearby.

 

“Ah, right? Give me a second.” The angel pulled out a smartphone with a yellow case. The case having two dorky angel wings poking out the sides of it. “Yes, please put me through to God. I have a prayer that needs urgent answering.”

The angel gave me a thumbs up as the phone responded. “Thank you for calling the God line. Unfortunately, our Lord is very busy and cannot take your prayer at the moment. If you hold, we will get back to you in five thousand years. If that is too long, please try again at a later time.” A holy voice said, offering little help.

 

“You don’t understand. This is urgent. If you don’t answer this prayer, he will die. My poor sweet Aron will die.” The angel cried out, gripping the phone closer to their face, pushing it against their perfect skin.

 

“You have selected Urgent. Because of the large number of urgent prayers at the moment, we cannot take your call. Please know, your faith is very important to us. Your current wait time is four thousand years.”

 

“My names Aidan, not Aron. Didn’t you even learn my name?” I whispered my grievances to the angel, who only gave me a look like that of a scolded puppy, sheepishly looking at their feet.

 

“I tried my best.” The angel was holding back sobs, their face screwing up as they turned away from me. I would have felt bad for them if not for the heavy footsteps approaching me. I pushed my back to the fence, turning to see the murderer staring down at me.

 

“Heh, found ya.” He crouched towards me, rubbing the barrel of his gun against my forehead. “Hope you said your prayers today. Oh, who cares if you did? I doubt anyone was listening.”

 

“Yeah, that’s perfect. You did the lines so well, I’m proud of you.” A second voice came after the man’s. The voice coming from his shoulder. I craned my neck, seeing a small demonic woman standing atop his shoulder. Her hooved feet stomping with glee as she pointed towards me. “Now, fire away.”

 “HOLD IT.” The guardian angel wiped the tears from his eyes, standing between us. “You know the rules. You can’t kill someone if they have an angelic intern. That’s the rules.”

 

There was a pause. No one said anything, only for the murderous man to look at my guardian angel, then at me. Without a second thought, he pulled the trigger.

 

CLICK.

 

I forced my eyes shut as darkness surrounded me. Was I dead? It was weird; I had felt no pain. Slowly, I opened my eyes, only to see the man smacking his gun against the floor. “How did the stupid thing jam?”

 

“I jammed it.” The demonic woman sighed, her shoulders dropping as she stared at me. “You got very lucky today. As much as us demons love breaking the rules, I would prefer not to anger my boss. He holds a grudge. Come on, I’m sure we can find someone else to kill. The nights still young.” The demon said, flicking the man on the ear.

 

“But I want to kill him. This isn’t fair, you promised.” The man whined as he stood up. His gun was still pointed at me, but he didn’t dare reach for the trigger.

 

“Keep this attitude up and you won’t get to kill anyone. Come on, I’m not wasting my time around some stupid intern. I have bigger fish to fry.” With that, the man left the alleyway, taking his demon with him.

My legs wobbled as he left, unable to pull myself up. After a few failed attempts, I gripped the fence, using it to pull myself to my feet. “S-should we call the police or something? She said he was going to kill someone else.”

 

“It’s fine. Most guardian angels should be able to deal with a low-level demon like her. Once they knock her from his shoulder, he will probably lose his bloodlust. If he doesn’t, then that might be a problem.” The angel didn’t sound concerned, only watching me, making sure I was alright. “How would you rate your experience with me? Was I helpful?”

 

“Is now the right time to be asking that?” I shot the angel a glare as I finally felt the strength return to my legs, able to hold myself up without the fences aid. “I nearly died because of you. Although, I guess you saved me.” I thought about my answer before reluctantly giving it. “You did an alright job. Three stars out of five.”

 

“A passing grade! Thank you so much. I’m going to be such a good guardian angel. Well, have a safe trip getting home.” With that, the angel left in a golden glow, leaving me standing alone in the alley.

 

“Couldn’t you have at least walked me home? Hello?” The loneliness of the night soon closed in around me as I left the alley. I made sure the murderous figure was gone before hurrying home, cursing the angel under my breath.
