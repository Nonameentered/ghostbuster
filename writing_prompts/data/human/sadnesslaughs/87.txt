The taste of old plastic lingered on my tongue, only mixing with the strange slushy blue fluid that had been pumped through the tube. The fluid tasteless, only having a sickening thickness to its contents which made me gag as the tube slipped from my lips, spilling its contents.

 

As I came to my senses, the dribbling cool liquid that had filled the tube continued to lower, already past my chest. It made its way to a drain under my feet, spilling out onto the floor outside before the tube was empty. I pressed my fingers against the icy glass, trying to force it open. No matter how much I pushed, my body was too weak, still exhausted from its previous stasis. My attempts growing more disheartened until I stopped. “Hello? Is someone out there? I need help.” My words caused another drop of liquid to spill down my bottom lip before I coughed up more fluid from my lungs.

 

“HELLO. Human. Do. You. Want. Help? Help. Here. I. Am. Unknown name.” Words drifted through the room, each robotic word having a unique voice to it. It was as if someone was splicing human speech. Some voices having a lofty tone while other were deep and calming. These voices mixing to create an unnerving mismatch of words.

 

“I need help. I’m trapped in here.” It was horrible. Whenever I thought I had cleared the liquid from my lungs, another disgusting spray of it would spill from my lips, making it hard to speak.

 

“Yes. Trapped. Terrible. Not good. Would. Recommend. Not. Being. Trapped.” Was it mocking me? Again, my fingers pushed against the glass, unable to get even a creak out of it. As my attempts grew more pathetic, the door eventually gave way, throwing me onto the floor outside.

 

As my body collided with the floor, I spat up the last drops of fluid I had in me, taking a moment to clear my throat. “Where am I?” Around me were various tubes, like the one I had fallen out of. Though, their condition was troubling. Scorched markings surrounded the exterior of the other tubes, some even having broken glass. I pulled myself to my feet, trying to find the source of the voice from earlier. “Did you do this?”

“In. Ship. Didn’t. Do.” It responded rather quickly, perhaps worried about the accusation.

 

“Where are you? Just stick to a single voice. This is hurting my head.” I searched the room for any sign of the creature but found nothing except the odd sound of scurrying. Whenever my eyes would get close to its location, it would flee before I could spot it, much to my annoyance.

 

“You won’t hurt me? I’m on your side. Promise. I’m Unknown name, I want to help you human. Look at the panel.” The creature brought my attention to the control panel, its small, furred form rather strange. It was round, shaped like a furry volleyball with stumpy arms and legs. It had a thick, squared head with a buttoned nose and two floppy ears. The creature scratched its silver coat of hair, offering me a fanged grin. “Friend?”

 

I didn’t answer it, taking a moment to assess the situation. It was an alien, that much was obvious, but why was it here? This was a human ship sent out to explore the galaxy. We were meant to wake up in twenty years and plan our next move from there. This was all wrong. “How did you get on this ship? Why are you here?” My approach startled the creature and soon it was gone. How was it so quick?

 

“Friend?” He asked, hesitating this time.

 

“Yes, friend. I won’t hurt you; I just need to know what’s going on here.” A soft sigh followed my words as the creature crawled out from behind a tube, approaching the panel once more. He tapped his claws against the panel, showing the coordinates of Earth.

 

“This is your home, yes? There’s danger. Enormous creatures are attacking, and we want to work with your kind to destroy it. We aren’t strong, but we are good with technology. I even made this translator.” He said proudly, showing me his cheek. Seated on his cheek was a round metallic circle that translated his words. He took it off, making a small swishing noise that I couldn’t understand. Only for that noise to become words when the device returned to his cheek. “See?”

 “Impressive. Is Earth really being attacked? I should send a message to them, get some more information.” I went to touch the controls, only for him to smack my hand.

 

“No, if you do that, they will know you survived. They came here to kill your kind before. They don’t know you survived. Come to my planet first and then we can send the message from there.”

 

“Alright fine. Do you want to set the coordinates? We can use my ship. It’s probably easier to use what I’m familiar with.” I headed for the cockpit, only for the creature to tap my back, halting my motions. He pointed to the closest window in the room, showing off a medium-sized ship that could probably fit at least fifthteen of his kind inside or maybe five humans. 

 

“Your ships are poorly built. They would be too slow; we could have had five wars before we even make it to my home. We will take my ship, it’s much faster. No offence.”

 

“None taken.” I checked the remaining pods, making sure they were devoid of life. Not wanting to leave anyone behind. The creature wasn’t lying. Everyone was dead. Only corpses remained housed in those tubes. I gathered whatever supplies I could, following them to their ship. “I’m Carter. What should I call you?”

 

“Unknown name.” It responded, motioning me along.

 

“That isn’t it a name. I don’t think your translator has a human word for your name. Is there something else I can call you?”

 

He thought about it for a moment before responding with, “Vit. Vit is similar enough to my name. Can you use that?”

 

“Sure, it’s nice to meet you Vit.” I said, approaching the exit of my ship, waiting for the heavy doors to pull open and reveal the interior of his ship, connected on the other side. I just hoped he wasn’t lying about all of this.
