Love Will Tear Us Apart. How ironic could a song be? Maxwell stared at his men, knowing that none of them would ever return home the same. Maybe it was his fault? If he hadn’t convinced them to resist love so forcefully, perhaps the monster would have given them some mercy. If he had just waved the white flag, maybe they could have ended up in a better state.

 

Maxwell shook the thought from his head. Thoughts like that were no good on the battlefield. What’s done is done. The best he could do was to prepare them for their future battles. The group currently huddled under a set of monkey bars, avoiding the occasional dangling boot from overhead.

 

“What are we supposed to do? Phil doesn’t want to play superheroes anymore; he says he wants to spend time with Vanessa.” Adrian said.

 

 “We can play superheroes without Phil.” Maxwell said. 

 

“But Phil was the villain. We can’t all be heroes.”

 

Maxwell dragged a hand over his forehead. He knew Adrian had a point. This battle would turn one of them into a villain. No man deserved to have that title staining their name. Only the truly powerful like Phil could wear that title. Phil had taken one for the team, being the first to engage with the enemy and, as expected, he was the first to fall.

 

“I’ll be the villain.” Maxwell said, knowing he could never put that title on someone else.

 

“You? But you lead our super powered friends of power league.” Jack said, the boy covering himself in bark, trying to camouflage himself to stay hidden from the love monster that lurked nearby.

 

“I can’t let anyone else turn evil. It’s fine. Mom bought me a super soaker. I can use that as my evil weapon.”

 

Both Jack and Adrian lowered their heads. Was this what they were coming to? Those weapons had been banned ever since the Parents’ intervention of 2019. Were they were going to break such a sacred set of rules just to keep their playtime going? Maxwell had to wonder if they were becoming the monsters now. 

 

“Mark? What are you doing?” Jack called out, the three boys turning to see their friend Mark sitting beside a girl of similar age. The two licking lollypops with their hands held together as they spoke about whatever topic was of interest. Currently, that was the topic of robots with laser eyes.

 

  
“Mark? Mark? PLEASE TELL ME HE HAD HIS COOTIE SHOT.” Maxwell shook Adrian, knowing his friend was the only one that could make the precise wet dirt mixture that was needed for a cootie shot. Adrian couldn’t even look his way, glancing to the side.

 

“I’m sorry. I was going to, but his mom said they had to go visit his grandmother and he couldn’t get mud on his clothes.”

 

“MUD? Does she think this is a game?” Damn that parents intervention, they lost a good man because of those rules. He had to wonder if the parents would have made the rules if they knew what chaos it would bring.

 

Their numbers had dropped from five to three. The three boys feeling the drop of morale that came from an utter defeat. It was as if the creature known as love was in the air. Wherever they looked, it approached them, even getting into their stomachs as tiny butterflies dancing around, causing unease.

 

“It’s ok. We will never like girls, right?” Jack said, though from the wavering of his voice, it was clear he didn’t believe his words. Maybe they all just wanted to believe that these times would last forever. It was a simple time, after all.

 

“Yeah, Jack. We will never like girls. Girls are icky.” Maxwell responded.

 

“Even moms?” Adrian said, causing the boys to think.

 

“Of course not. Moms are perfect.” Maxwell couldn’t believe he had to explain that. Wasn’t it common knowledge at this point? The three boys felt isolated, the large playground now feeling so small. It was as if, wherever they looked, there was a potential problem. “Remember, love is a big scary monster that is blind. So, watch out for its hearing. Let’s all be as quiet as possible.”

 

Maxwell had heard the phrase; love is blind at some point in his life. Maybe from a show or from his parent’s chatter. Either way, he now had a theory that love was some invisible monster that made people fall in love. He didn’t know how it worked, but he had heard his older brother mention girls a lot and then suddenly he had a girlfriend. Once he got a girlfriend, he didn’t want to play video games with Maxwell anymore, which was something Maxwell couldn’t comprehend. What could be better than video games?

 
“Ok, I’ll whisp-AH.” Adrian jumped as a hand tapped his shoulder. He turned to see a group of girls staring at the boys, having watched their game from afar.

 

“What game are you playing? Can we join in?” Abigail, the oldest of the group, asked as the other two watched.

 

The three boys stared at their feet, no one able to think of an answer. The silence sat in the air until eventually Maxwell responded. “We were going to play superheroes, but we don’t have a villain anymore.”

 

“Oh, I thought you were playing soldiers. Well, Trina usually pretends to be a villain when we play. Maybe we can join you and pretend to fight against her? Go on Trina, show them your evil catchphrase.”

 

The rather shy looking girl stepped out from behind her friend. She cleared her throat before getting into character. “Mwhahaha. All your cookies now have raisins.” She said before stepping back behind Abigail, now that she was out of character.

 

The boys had chills. That was the evilest thing any of them could imagine. But could they really risk the love monster? As much as they wanted to play, the boys continued dragging their feet until the third girl spoke.

 

“Come on, unless you are all chicken.” Debbie said with a small laugh.

 

“Debbie… They won’t want to play if you call them chickens.” Abigail gave her friend a soft nudge before Debbie muttered an apology.

 

“Chicken? I’m not chicken. If there’s a villain, Captain Danger will beat them. What’s your villain’s name?” Jack asked.

 

“Raising Chaos. Get it, Raising. Like, Rais-en?” Trina said, a smile growing on her face as they talked.

 

“Oh, that’s funny. You’re funny. Come on, let’s play.”

 

Maxwell and Adrian stared at one another for a moment. Adrian had been touched and nothing had happened. Even a cootie shot couldn’t prevent close contact. Could it be this monster was all in their heads? As the two contemplated the thought, they both heard robotic pew pew’s being fired at them.

 

“I’ve got you both. Surrender heroes.” Trina said, stepping into the middle of the group, her fingers pointed at Maxwell and Adrian.

 

“Not if we can help it, Evil doer. Meet our newest members of the super powered friends of power league,” Maxwell said as the group played together while their parents watched on. The imaginary monster they were hunting having vanished from their minds as they returned to playing heroes.
