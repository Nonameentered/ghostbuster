[Part 2 of 2]

“Huh? Oh, nonsense. Don’t worry about being a bad guest. Just enjoy your eternal servitude.” Azia was in too much of a flutter to notice her words, buzzing back and forth until she finally relaxed into the seat. Once she hit the chair, her body grew, reaching five feet before it stopped.

 

“Ah, that explains the house. I have to say, that sunflower coloured dress is stunning. Where did you get it from?” Melchior made conversation, not daring to reach for the food until they offered it.

 

“Like I would tell an outsider. It’s made by fairies. That’s all you need to know.” It was obvious she was sulking, this tea party taking far longer than she had expected. “Oh, how about some tea?”

 

“That would be lovely.”

 

Azia poured the tea into the tiny cup, spilling more of the liquid onto the table, then she got into the cup. When the liquid was poured, she picked up the cup and placed it before him. “Want some cake to go with it? Any thoughts on the cup?”

 

“The cup is cute. I really like the pattern on it. It really suits you.” With no complaints, the vampire happily drank from the cup. Savoring the one small sip he got from it. “Lovely.”

 

“It is cute…” The fairy reached for a piece of cake with her hand, grabbing the red velvet cake, slamming it onto his plate. “There, enjoy the cake, too.”

 

The cake looked delectable, if not a little smushed with fingerprints all over the icing. This was the first thing to earn a reaction from the vampire, his eyebrow raising as his expression turned to one of disgust. That didn’t last long, though. The vampire carefully brought the plate to his mouth before pressing his spoon against the top of the cake.

 

As the spoon made contact, he heard Azia gasp. She was practically leaning halfway across the table, not letting him out of sight. Melchior gave the cake a quick look over, tapping the top with his spoon, watching as a small bit of red icing leaked from the hollowed-out center. So, that was her plan? She wanted him to take a big bite of the cake, only to shoot the icing everywhere. He had to admit; he was impressed.

 

To avoid a mess, he brought the cake to his mouth and dug his fangs into it. Sucking any of the icing into his mouth. It wasn’t the most pleasant feeling, but the look of astonishment on Azia’s face made it worth it. When the inside was cleared out, he took small bites of the remaining cake.

“Delightful. You should have some, too.”

 

“I’ve lost my appetite.”

 

“Really? But you made so much food? I couldn’t possibly eat all of this by myself. At least have some tea.”

 

The fairy poured herself a small cup, spilling most of it onto the table. The already tea coated table now having a rather big tea puddle in its middle. She didn’t drink from the cup, however, only watching him like a hawk. Whenever he would try to engage her in small talk, she would either give yes or no answers, or she would just let out a grumble.

 

After an hour passed, the vampire decided he had spent an appropriate amount of time at the tea party. If he stayed any longer, he would intrude, something that only a bad guest would do.

 

“I appreciate you inviting me here today. I’ll leave the cupcakes behind for you to enjoy.” Melchior carefully stood up, tucking his chair into the table before making his way to the door. Azia followed behind him, staring at her feet the entire time. At the door, Melchoir waited for her to open it, not wanting to risk a mistake in the most vital moments of the battle.

 

“Whatever.” Azia opened the door, waiting for him to run off. It’s what any sane person would do after surviving a tea party with a fairy. Melchior grabbed his umbrella that he had left outside and aimed it out the door, letting it expand before he stepped out, shielding him from the rays of the setting afternoon sun.  

 

“You don’t get many guests, do you? Your tea party reeked of desperation.”

 

“Just leave. If you wanted to mock me, you should have done it inside. I guess you knew why I really invited you.”

 

“I have lived five hundred years. You’re hardly the first trickster to come my way.”

 

“So, you just wanted to mock me, is that it? I should come out there and break your umbrella. Then we will see how cocky you really are.”

 

“Vampires are only weak to light. I could still survive the walk home without it. Especially with the sun setting. I won’t combust or anything, if that’s what you are imagining.”

 

“Right, cause you’re so cool. Just leave. I didn’t want to hang around you anyway.” Azia went to shut the door, only for a polished black shoe to block her.

  
“That’s a shame. I was hoping we could have a tea party again. Maybe one at my home this time? I didn’t mind the company today. I don’t get many visitors so I must admit I was excited when I found you knocking on my window. How about it? Care for a tea party. One without either of us trying to gain the upper hand?”

 

Azia couldn’t believe her pointed ears. She quickly tried to remember all her vampire knowledge. Surely this had to be a trick? Was there some strange rule that if you entered a vampire’s home, you became one? She couldn’t recall anything like that. As she thought it over, Melchior squirmed, the sensation of the door hitting the side of his shoe getting uncomfortable.

 

“Please, think it over. Just maybe, don’t hold my foot hostage while you do.”

 

“Sorry!” Azia opened the door, allowing him to pull his foot back. “I guess if you need the company, I can visit. That means you have to prepare the tea and snacks too. No blood either, that’s gross.”

 

“I assure you I am an excellent host and not because I have to be. I’ll prepare a tea party that will put yours to shame.”

 

“Put mine to shame? HEY, I worked really hard at that tea party. Even if I was trying to control you, I still wanted it to be nice. Just you wait, I’ll make the best tea party around after yours.”

 

“I would love that. I’ll see you on Saturday. Bring your teapot. I find it absolutely adorable.”

“Fine, that counts as me bringing something, though. So don’t expect any cakes or stuff.” Azia waved as the vampire left, unable to stop herself from smiling.
