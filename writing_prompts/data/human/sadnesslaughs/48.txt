“Wait, I get mental health days? That’s not a code word for hypnosis or some other form of mind control, right?”

 

“Oh, heavens no. Get punched by heroes enough and you will need a day or two to get over it. I just think it’s best to give my employees that rest. Can’t have poor morale when I’m trying to rob a bank.” Opal Raider handed me a pen as she led me through her secret lair, casually pointing out her prized stolen possessions as we made our way to the cafeteria.

 

“Oh? So, the mental health days count as sick days?”

 

“No, it’s separate. You also get time off for injuries or illnesses that you get during your time working for me. It would be useless taking you along on a mission with a broken arm. I tried taking someone with a broken arm along once. They ended up needing a hand.” She turned, waiting for a laugh.

 

I could only give her a polite smile, wondering if she had even made a joke. Her grin slowly faded when she realized that was the best response she was going to get. The sparkly suited villain quickly turning forward again, continuing the tour.

 

“Guess you had to be there. See, the joke is that Fred, my first henchman, ended up losing a hand because his cast got caught in a wood grinder. Maybe it’s not funny since I explained it. Anyway, all you need to know is that we changed our healthcare rules in response to a few workplace accidents.”

 

“I’m glad to hear you are a boss that moves with the times?” I did my best to get a positive out of her words, only to receive a finger snap in response.

 

“See, you get it. It’s important to move with the times. Heroes get caught in the whole theatrical side of crime fighting. Those whole city-wide combat affairs. Which is why us villains are more into the thievery and blackmailing. Less chance of getting punched through a computer screen. It would also surprise you to learn how many heroes can’t use a computer. I once watched the hero Yuma through his webcam. He tried to download ram for two hours. He just sat there hitting the same shady link until his sidekick eventually explained how ram works. To which he proceeded to punch a hole through the monitor and exclaim. How’s that for a ram?”

 

“Are you serious? I actually applied to work for Yuma. I never would have known he was that incompetent.”

“Jeez, you applied to work with him? No wonder you ended up at a villain’s lair. I bet he didn’t even read your resume. Probably just got someone else to read it. What was he like?”

 

“Honestly? I didn’t even see him. His sidekick just showed me around. It’s kind of nice to get a tour from the boss, makes me feel important.”

 
“You should feel important. You get to run with the great Opal Raider. Speaking of which, we will need to get you a codename. What about Sir Moon? Or Sir Moonstone, if you want to use the full name.”

 

”Sir Moon is fine. How did you come up with your name?”

 

“You ever seen one of those online villain name generators? Yeah, I just mashed that a few times. Worked out pretty well, if you ask me.”

 

“No kidding. Guess it worked out well.” She wasn’t what I expected from a villain. She seemed far too happy. Whenever I heard the word villain, I envisioned some brooding person in a cape hiding in a cave twiddling their thumbs. Not a bright workplace in a normal office building.

 

“Lets move onto the part that wins over most of my employees. The food.” She nudged the door to the cafeteria with her shoulder. Inside, a handful of henchmen sat casually talking amongst themselves, only to stop and raise their drinks when she entered.

 

“Awesome job on the last mission, boss.” One shouted.

 

“Awesome job tasing Bendy Breaker for me. You got him right under the ribs too. What a shot. Your target practice has been really paying off.”

 

“You’re too kind, boss. We both know I only made the shot because you were holding him still for me.”

 

“That’s irrelevant. You had the courage to fire that taser and hit your mark. No matter the circumstances, you did a good job. Now give me five fairy claps for yourself.”

 

“Yes, boss.” The henchman gave little fairy claps, tapping his fingers together as the other henchmen around him joined in. As I watched the display, I felt a chilly hand grip my arm.

 

“Oh, hey. You’re the newbie. I loved your resume. You know we went to the same college? Also heard you studied PR. That will be really useful for our organization. Let me know if you need a hand.”

 

I looked down at the man’s metallic hand, watching as he let go of my arm. Once he had released me, he removed the hand from his wrist, letting the removed robotic hand gave me a wave without even being connected to his body.

“I already made a hand joke, Fred. I told you that you need to be quicker than that.” Opal Raider smirked, only for Fred to pout as he reconnected the hand.

 

I just stared at Fred, unable to comprehend what he had done. That hand wasn’t even on his wrist. How could he move it? Was it some sort of weird magic trick? Noticing my confusion, Fred quickly explained himself.

 

“Oh, it’s through my brain. My brain sends signals to the device, and it reads the waves. Means I can take my hand off and control it remotely. Very good for missions. It’s also covered under our insurance, so if you ever want one, I can show you where the grinder is.”

 

“No, thank you.” I responded, earning a quick laugh from the room.

 

“Don’t worry, I’ll make sure you don’t lose any hands. Maybe a foot, but not a hand.” Opal joked. She led me to the henchman that were lining up for lunch. When they noticed I was new, they moved aside, letting me order before them. “Our food is all fresh and can be catered to any dietary requirements. Today we are serving Ramen, but we have other options available. I know Ramen isn’t the healthiest dish, but you need to treat yourself occasionally. Plus, we burn the calories here.”  

 

“Ramen would be lovely.”

 

We got our food and headed for a free table. When I sat down, a siren went off, causing a few of the henchmen to stand up.

 

“Ugh, sorry. Would have loved to join you for lunch, but it seems like I underestimated how long the tour would take. I kind of double booked you with an art heist and as much as I would love to cancel, a truck moving antique artworks doesn’t stop for my schedule. I’ll continue when I get back. For now, I’ll leave you in Fred’s capable hand. Team two, get ready to move. We went over this last week before office happy hour, so everyone should know their roles.”

 

And like that, she moved out. Leading a few henchmen out of the cafeteria with her. I could hear footsteps outside the room. Most likely, other henchmen were moving to their meeting point from other areas of the facility. Fred sat across from me, taking Opal’s ramen for himself.

 

“Think you will join?” He asked, before digging into the meal.

 

I took a quick slurp of my ramen, making sure the food was as good as it smelt. After that confirmation, I reached into my pocket, taking out the pen Opal gave me. I signed my name on the contract and slid it over.

 

“I would love to join.”
