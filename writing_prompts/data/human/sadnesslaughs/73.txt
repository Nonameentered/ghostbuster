“I’ve got it. I’ll beat him with the power of friendship. All I need to do is to gather all my friends and storm his castle. The bastard won’t even know what hit him. He will be like, oh, please don’t hurt me, brave Todd. And I’ll be like. I’ll slay you for all the beautiful ladies of the land, so they may live a day without fearing your overbearing power.” I explained my plan to the disinterested bartender. The old woman behind the counter having long ago tired of my tales.

 

“You would need friends for that. Last I checked, the closest thing you had to a friend was that sword of yours, and that would probably leave you if it had a pair of legs.” Berta smirked, hiding it beneath the dirty cloth she used to clean the counter, not wanting to insult her customer any further.

 

“Ok, fine. Maybe I can’t use the power of friendship but there are other cliches. What about the lover’s route? If I just find some lovely ladies who will want to fight for me, maybe I can use that to take down the Dark lord. Oh, what if I find a demon in a maid's outfit? That was quite popular back in my world.”

 

“In your world? You’re still carrying on about this otherworld? You must have really knocked your head when you fell from that mountain. What is this nonsense about demons in maid outfits, anyhow? Why would a demon wear such a foolish attire? Although, I guess a demon in a maid outfit is more believable than someone loving you.” She didn’t even bother to hide her smirk this time, just letting out a laugh as I glared.

 

“You don’t understand. There’s a lot of deep symbolism that comes from the maid outfit. That’s not the point. I can make someone love me. I’m likable.”

 

She pushed a few strands of silver hair from her forehead, looking at me with pity. I could see her tongue pushing against her lip as she pondered a response before deciding to just say it. “The last time you tried flirting with someone, you ended up crying in their lap about how your mother never actually loved you.”

 

“SHE TOLD PEOPLE ABOUT THAT?”

 

“Only a handful of people. It could be worse, though; you could have been like that loser who tried to woo a noble lady by offering to pay a whole three gold for her drinks. Could you imagine being that stingy with your money around a noble?”

 

“Heh, yeah. At least I’m not them.” I slouched forward on my stool, hiding my face against the tavern counter. Why did everyone seem to hear about my mistakes? I bet that other reincarnated hero Thomas doesn’t deal with this. That stupid newbie. Just because he can breathe fire, he thinks he’s so hot.

“If you are going for clichés, why not look for a legendary weapon? I hear Thomas found a bow of Exin. Could you imagine that? Now that’s a hero. I would buy that man a drink, speaking of. Cough up the gold.” She banged her hand on the counter, stirring me from my slump.

 

“Have you tried lifting a legendary weapon? Those things are heavy. Not to mention the way they sting those of us without a noble heart. What even is a noble heart? What? Because Thomas has never said a curse, he thinks he is better than me. I was here protecting you all before that pretty boy came along.” The booze had hit its mark. I was now in the drunken rambling stage of my late nights at the tavern, picking myself up from the stool before I tossed down a few gold coins. “There.”

 

“There’s no hard feelings Todd. We just admire someone that can help us. All you have done is eat and cause damage to people’s belongings. Did you forget that stage where you were kicking drawers and pots?”

 

“That worked in my world. You don’t get it. None of you get it. I wanted to be somebody. My whole life in the otherworld was spent being a loser. I thought things would be different.” Turning to the door, I gave Berta a final glance. She only gave me an almost saddened look in response, one of slight pity. Maybe now she regretted her words.

 

“There’s a barn outside of town. It will get cold later tonight. If you are quiet, you can probably sleep there without the owner knowing.” Her tone softened as she said that, collecting my loose coins.

 

“Thanks. I love being yelled at by farmers and sleeping in barns. You could offer me a room, you know. Or maybe a blanket. I can’t even get a free meal in this town.” I let out my fiery words, gripping the door as I marched through it. 

“It isn’t like that, Todd. I can’t just hand out free things. People will expect the same for them if I do. Just be safe.”

 

“Shove it.” I went to slam the door, only for the heavy wood to not budge, causing me to do a little twist, throwing myself out of the tavern, headfirst into the dirt below. As I picked stray pieces of dirt from my teeth, I thought over her words. They don’t respect me. None of them do. I’ll show them. I’ll march right up to the Dark Lord and take his head.”

 

The trip to the Dark lord wasn’t as bad as one might expect. He lived only a few miles away from the village, always a looming presence on the outskirts of the area. That only made people fear him more. A villain that didn’t hide behind distance or battalions of minions was a fearsome foe. Sure, he had minions, but all of them stayed in the castle, making the journey rather pleasant.

 

My calves stung as I arrived at the castle, pushing aside the last remaining pieces of shrubbery before I saw the cobblestone walls. “I’ll show him.” Heading up to the gate, I kicked the door open with my last piece of drunken bravado. “I'M HERE FOR YOUR HEAD.” I shouted before rubbing the back of my calf, feeling the stinging worsen after that kick.

 

“Oh, you’re early? You must be this Thomas I hear so much about. Have you considered my offer to join me? I know about this otherworld you keep hidden. I was born from it too.” He stood up, his pitch black helmet hiding his terrifying features. He stormed around his throne, waiting for my response.

 

“I’m Todd. Like that, Thomas would be brave enough to come here.” My rage vanished into confusion at the otherss words. “Offer to join you? Wait, why didn’t I get an offer?” 

“Oh, the one that cried in my lap?” The Dark lord dropped the act, sitting back in their throne. They removed their helmet, causing a flow of brown locks to slip free from it. Her blue eyes locked on me as she gave a smile. “Way to go against the cliches, right? The only way to survive here is to go against the tide. Everyone expects a mean, grizzled Dark lord, which means I can move between the village and here with ease.” She said proudly.

 

“It’s you? You’re um.”

 

“You cried on my lap and yet you didn’t even bother to remember my name? That hurts. Heather’s my name. Why are you here anyway? I thought you would try some dumb scheme to kill me.”

 

“My schemes aren’t dumb. Why are you the Dark lord? Weren’t you sent here to kill them?”

 

“I was, and I did. Unfortunately, there’s no actual way to leave once you kill the Dark lord, so I took his place. It’s nice here. You get minions and a cozy castle. It’s high living.” After explaining herself, she gave a fake yawn. “Wow, look at the time. You should probably head back. It was nice talking to you.”

 

“Aren’t you worried I would tell someone?”

 

“No one would believe you. You stumbled into the forest drunk. Who would believe anything you said? Maybe if you were Thomas, someone would listen.” She admitted, leaning back into her throne.

 

“Wait. Let me join you. I’m sick of being the butt of every joke. At least working here would be less embarrassing. Maybe I can find us a way out of here. I know every cliché. One of them is bound to work.” I desperately pleaded my usefulness as Heather thought over my words.

 

“Fine, you can stay. Just don’t impede my plans, ok? There are spare rooms down the hall to your right. Get some rest. If you still feel like working for me when you sober up, we can decide something then.” She waved me off with a flick of her wrist. 

Suddenly I was standing in the hallway, looking back to only see a glimpse of the throne room. “What a rude way to end a conversation.” I showed the throne room my middle finger, only to feel my finger burn, orange flames surrounding it. “IT WAS A JOKE, A JOKE.” Just like that, the flames left, leaving my finger thankfully unharmed. “No sense of humor.” I grunted, entering the room, wanting to get some rest.
