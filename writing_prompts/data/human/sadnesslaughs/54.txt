“Bloody hell, I’ve got crabs again.” Captain Marvis shouted; her words followed by childish giggles from her crewmates.

 

“You know they have treatments for that, don’t you, Marvis?” Alex retorted, earning more laughter from the crew, some even hunching over to hold their stomachs. One might think the joke would have gotten old by now, but with the empty boredom of space, that small joke never ceased to entertain the crew.

 

“It’s captain to you, private. That joke wasn’t funny the first time you said it, let alone the third.” Marvis shook her pale spacesuit, watching as three small blue crabs fell from the suit, each one landing on the floor only to scatter away into various corners of the room.

 

“It was a little funny, lighten up. It’s not like we haven’t all been in that situation before. Remember when Rodgers had a crab crawling around in his helmet for an entire mission? Then-“ Alex wheezed, struggling to continue his story as the memory flooded back into his mind. “Then when he goes to take the helmet off, the stupid thing pinches his nose. I thought it was going to pull his freaking nose off.”

 

“I also remember you crying after a crab scuttled towards you for the first time. What were you screaming? Want to remind me what you were babbling about?”

 

“Look, I thought it was like those head crab things that shoot eggs down your throat. How was I supposed to know it was just a regular crab?” Alex sunk down into his chair, trying to avoid the gazes of his crewmates now that their laughter had turned on him.

 

“Technically, they aren’t just regular crabs. They are space crabs or something of the sort. If you don’t mind me using layperson terminology. We have considered adding a new category to the Brachyura family to compensate for this discovery but as you know, scientists love to argue over the minor details so classification may take a while.” Candice felt the need to offer the correction to Alex, even if her crewmate didn’t seem thrilled to hear the information.

 

“You ever heard the saying. If it walks like a duck?” Alex asked, watching as Candice rolled her eyes.

 

“No, I’m not debating this stupid thing with you again. Just because they look and act like crabs does not just mean we can call them crabs. Tell him, Captain.”

 

“It would save us a lot of time if we could just call them crabs and move on. Still, Candice is right. We have a duty to properly categorize the crabs we come across. We can’t consider the crabs that talk the same as those that just mindlessly float throughout space.”

 “Thank you.” Candice smiled, turning to Alex, who only replied by sticking his tongue out at her.

 

“I expected a little more from space travel than just crabs. They promised me aliens and adventure. Not crabs hiding under every rock we come across. Just once I would like to see an alien kangaroo or hell, even an alien spider. Just something that isn’t a crab.” Ethan groaned, the pilot not looking away from his controls as he added his two cents to the conversation. 

 

“An alien kangaroo? Could you imagine how high that would jump in zero gravity? Hey, Captain. Can we make a quick stop at Earth? I just want to get something real quick.” Alex grinned.

 

“Alex, if you don’t shut up, I’m going to bounce you out of the airlock. Go do something productive and pick up those loose crabs.” Marvis gave the order, watching as Alex slouched his shoulders in response.

 

“Can’t somebody else do it?”

 

“Maybe, but you’re the only one that isn’t busy. Candice is still working on the last specimens, Ethan is driving, and I’m managing the lot of you. That just leaves you to pick up the crabs.”

 

“Ugh. Is this anyway to treat your engineer? Just because the engines aren’t falling apart doesn’t mean you can make me do the odd jobs.” Alex complained, only for Marvis to motion him towards one of the blue crabs. The crab awkwardly bumping into the wall, trying to scale it. “FINE.”

 

Alex found a medium-sized container. Using it to scoop up the crabs. He was rather hesitant to approach them, jumping whenever their pincers would snap. Eventually, he scooped up the three crabs, handing them over to Candice for further research. Just as things seemed to quiet down, a blip appeared on the flight controls, causing Ethan to shout back to Marvis.

 

“UNKNOWN SHIP INBOUND.”

 

Marvis rushed to his side, placing a hand on his shoulder as she stared at the monitor. “Open up communications.”

 

“I bet it’s a freaking crab.” Alex joined the two as he took a position by Ethan’s other shoulder.

 

“Nonsense. How would a crab operate a ship? This is the discovery we have been waiting for.” Ethan tapped away at his controls before a small window opened, revealing the interior of a ship with a small red crab sitting on what looked to be a captain’s chair. The crab had on a pair of metallic gloves. The gloves having ten long fingers that seemed to shift with the movement of the claws.

 

“Crabs again.” Marvis called out, only for the crew to groan back in unison.

 

“Well, let’s see what these want.” Alex said, not even attempting to hide his boredom as the crew started another tedious encounter with a crab for the sixteenth time this year.
