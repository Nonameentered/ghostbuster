“Hey, weird weather today, right? Anyway, now that we are friends, are you using that body?’

 

“Using that?! Why would I be using it? I just came here to dump the body off. Wait, who even are you?” Marvin flashed his knife at the robed figure, slowly getting up from his hunched position beside the body, his eyes never leaving the robed figure. His fingers turning white as he tightened his grip on the knifes handle, ready to pounce.

 

“Easy, easy. I’m a connoisseur of the dead, too. I’m a necromancer. Yeah, those people that can magically resurrect dead bodies. We are real. Most of us just work at haunted houses now, well used to. Too many people got bitten. Did you ever hear about the bite of ninety-“

 

“I don’t care. What I want to know is how you found this place. I covered my tracks perfectly. No one comes to this lake this time of year, the lakes practically frozen over. So, how did you find out about the bodies?” Marvin lurched forward, slowly drawing closer to the necromancer, closing the distance between them, able to see the messy red beard hairs underneath the necromancer's hood.

 

“Did you think you were the only serial killer that comes to this place? I hate to tell you this, but frozen lakes are a cliché. I wasn’t specifically following you; I just noticed that a lot of bodies turn up here, so I come and fish them out every week or so. So, are you using that body? If you’re just going to throw it, can I have it? Saves me getting my robes wet.” The necromancer went to step past Marvin, only to get blocked by him. Marvin pointing his knife at the man, keeping him back.

 

“What, so you can take the body to the police? Is this some sort of joke? Kill your own person if you want a body.”

 

“Ew, I’m not a freak. I don’t believe in murder, only eternal servitude through a lifeless and cold existence, stuck between the confines of purgatory and earth, forced to walk when your body cries out for sleep. Now, can I please just have the body?”

 

“That’s barbaric…”

 

“No worse than what you do. If you asked most people, they would probably say I’m morally superior to you. Eternal servitude isn’t a bad thing. I’m a nice owner. I even release them from their servitude after one hundred years. How many necromancers can you say that about?”

 

Marvin’s hand throbbed, his tight grip straining his muscles. He lowered his hand, not entirely resting it, just trying to save his strength. He took another step. This time, however, the man opened his robes, pointing a pistol at Marvin.

“I don’t think that’s a good idea. I didn’t come here today to be another victim. Now, are you going to let me get the body or not?”

 

Marvin looked back at the body, then at the necromancer. He considered his options and stepped aside, allowing the necromancer a clear path to the body. As the necromancer walked towards the icy lake’s edge, Marvin re-tightened his grip on the knife, rushing towards the now exposed back of the necromancer only to feel a hot stinging sensation pierce through his shoulder, as the necromancer turned around and fired a shot.

 

The knife left his hands, getting lost amongst the various leaves and branches scattered along the ground. Marvin dropped to his knees, frantically searching for the knife while the necromancer continued his walk, stopping beside the recently killed body, pressing one hand to their throat as the corpse took in a sudden gasp for air. The corpse coughed and sputtered, choking momentarily before rising from the ground, taking a spot beside the necromancer.

 

“Found your knife, yet?” He asked, sliding the hood of his robe off. The necromancer grinning down at the pathetic sight of the killer on his knees, watching them scurry along the ground searching for their weapon. His deep green eyes following each movement, waiting for him to find it. “A little to your left.”

 

Marvin pushed aside a branch, regathering the blade. The killer rolling onto his back, pointing to the knife towards the necromancer. He hadn’t dared get up, too in awe of the sight of his victim standing once more. Their wounds were still visible, having a strange green aura radiating from them as if the victim’s soul was shining through the gaps.

 

“You got the body….” Was all he could say. Marvin shivering as he eventually gave up on trying to look threatening, dropping the knife so he could hold his aching shoulder.

 

“And you’re wondering why I’m still here? For fulfilment.”

 

“Fulfilment?”

 

“Imagine how it must feel to be murdered. How much resentment you must carry after your death? How much hate you must have in your soul? If those souls don’t get their revenge, they become a nuisance. I’m guessing this is your first encounter with the supernatural, so let me fill you in on something quickly. If you think I’m scary, you haven’t seen a pissed off spirit. So, I’m here to make sure this one feels fulfilled by killing you.”

 

“W-wait. If you kill me, I’ll come back as a spirit. I’ll remember your face and kill you. I’ll kill even more people.”

The necromancer only laughed, crouching by Marvin’s side. “People like us don’t get that choice. Heaven and Earth are for the victims and the good. People like us will burn, and I’m quite prepared for that. I wonder if you are.”

 

“I can help you gather people. You want bodies, right? I’ll get you bodies. There're heaps in this lake. I can fish them out for you. So, you don’t have to get your robes wet.”

 

“I’m aware of all the bodies in the lake. I’ve been talking to them; how else do you think I learned about you? I was lying. I have been following you. All those tricks you did to avoid detection didn’t work. You’re pathetic.”

 

Marvin grimaced before lashing out for his knife, only for the blade to get kicked by the necromancer, sending it across the ground. Marvin tried to crawl for it, only to feel a dead hand grab his leg, holding him in place.

 

“I’ll release their binds once they kill you. Until then, you can enjoy a reunion with them.” The necromancer pulled up his hood, leaving Marvin to stare at the frozen lake, watching as dead hands clawed through the ice, with their bodies rising from the water, each heading towards the killer.

 

The necromancer waited in his car, turning on the radio and tapping his foot along to the music, waiting for ten minutes to pass before winding down the window, letting his hand hang out as a golden aura left his palm. “I release your bindings; may you find peace now that your killer has been sent to hell.” He heard water splashing as the dead returned to where they had been resting, leaving behind only their bodies to be frozen in the cold depths as their souls were freed.

 

“Well, that gets rid of the Millhaven Crawler. Wonder who’s next?” He switched the radio to a news station, keeping his ear open for any murders as he drove home.
