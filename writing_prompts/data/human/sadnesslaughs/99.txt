What sane person enjoys Christmas? Even as a child, the holiday filled me with more anxiety than joy. Every Christmas day my parents would push me in front of various uncles and cousins who I barely knew. Then they expected me to act happy when they gave me spare socks and what other cheap items they could find on the drive over to our place. That’s not even mentioning the shopping aspect of Christmas. Last year, an old woman bit me on the shoulder. Yes, bit me over a packet of bacon. When I told the security guard about it, he only shrugged and suggested I wear shoulder pads next year.

 

Which is why I have firmly stated that Christmas is cancelled in our household. Yes, I know that makes me a grinch, but what choice do I have? My job is running me ragged. I can’t handle another old lady bite. Of course, I still got my son a present, a small gift to help ease his lack of a Christmas. It was the least I could do. In my mind, it made sense. He still got the gift without the boring festivities. It was a win/win for everyone involved.

 

As I pushed open the door, I spotted a silhouette sitting on the couch. It didn’t appear to be moving, but it was certainly there. Maybe I was finally going insane? I heard a doctor say that stress can cause hallucinations. Maybe I could get a sick day out of it? Wouldn’t that be nice? I went to flick on the light, only for words to drift from the couch.

 

“Don’t scream.” Have those two words ever made a person not scream? My lungs ached as I let out a high-pitched wail, smacking the light on to see a white bearded man slouched back on my couch. His enormous mass of stomach peeling under the folds of his festive coat.

 

“My wife’s having an affair with a mall Santa? Oh god, why couldn’t it have been my neighbor or something less embarrassing than this. So close to Christmas too.” If I hadn’t already had my spirit broken by life, this was the final nail in my stone coffin. Seeing the hideous man before me broke my heart.

“What? No, I’m happily married. It’s about your son. He asked me to speak to you. You, see. I’m Santa and a special little boy told me you have lost your Christmas spirit. I’m here to help you get it back.” He said, letting out a jolly laugh.

 

“I don’t know who you are, but you stay away from my son, you creep. Get out of here before I call the cops. I’m a brilliant father. I just hate Christmas and everything it stands for. Look. I even got him a gift.” I pulled the small toy robot from the pocket of my coat. Waving the sleek black robot in the man’s face. “Even has ten special sound effects and a blaster that shoots water. What kid won’t love that?”

 

“Twenty dollars? Is that how much your son is worth to you?” The man raised a finger as the robot slipped from my grip, flying towards him. When the man caught the robot, he shook it, small green sparks flying from his hand before he floated the robot back to me. It was suddenly triple the size, like the size of a small dog. Its water blaster now a water cannon with a changeable faceplate too. “Now, that’s a toy.”

 

“It’s not about the money. The best present I ever received was a hand-me-down pair of sneakers from my older brother. Something that was far cheaper than that toy and I adored it.” In my rage, the magic of the moment slipped through my mind until I realized. “You’re actually Santa.”

 

“I am. Which is why I am very upset with you. Christmas is a sacred holiday. One that should be cherished.” As he spoke, two elves slipped out from behind the couch, placing down a tray of cookies and two glasses of milk. The elves weren’t as cute as one might have thought from their cartoony photos. They were like little gremlins, having hunched bodies and sharp teeth. They even snarled when they spotted me before retreating behind the couch. “Milk and cookies?”

 

“No thanks. I appreciate you are doing this for my son, but I have had a rough day. I just want to go tell my wife I love her and wish my son goodnight. It’s way past his bedtime. I don’t want to miss out on wishing him a goodnight two nights in a row.” I went to walk past the man, only for the elves to jump out, blocking me from leaving the room.

“Just a quick chat? Please, have a cookie and relax. Christmas is a magical time. Do you know the traditions of Christmas?” He snapped his fingers as a thick, candy cane colored book appeared in his meaty hands. He went to open the book, only to get interrupted by me.

 

“Whatever you’re selling, I’m not interested. My decision on the matter is final.” I went to push past the elves, only for the man to stand, his stomach wobbling as he dropped the book, choosing to place his hand against my chest, halting me.

 

“I really think you should try one of those cookies.” He said, trying to remain jovial, despite a scowl crossing onto his face.

 

“Go choke on a glass of milk.” I smacked his hand away, heading towards the hallway, only to feel two small sets of hands clutching my ankles, holding me in place. “What the hell? Get your little monsters off me.”

 

“Should have just taken the cookies. It’s the most wonderful time of the year.” He sang, retrieving a needle from his coat. The contents of the needle-colored green, red and white. He gave the tip of the needle a flick before pushing it into my neck.

 

I tried to scream, but the only words that came out were. “With the kids jingle belling, and everyone telling you be of good cheer.” I couldn’t stop myself. The words spewing out from my mouth as I desperately tried to hold myself together.

 

“Yes, it’s the most wonderful time of the year.” Santa continued, standing before me with a smirk. His old face now had a more youthful appearance, and he even seemed jollier. I felt the hands around my legs release, seeing the elves in their full Christmas glory. With blushed red cheeks and clean neat locks of hair. Their sharpened teeth now pure white gemstones of Christmas joy. “Enjoy your Christmas, you walking moneybag. Come on, we have a lot of people to cover.” Santa and the elves let themselves out, leaving me to collapse onto the couch.

Hot sweats pooled at my forehead, trying to contain this sudden injection of Christmas spirit. No, I must resist the urge to buy Mariah Carey albums. I won’t become like them. My fingers clutched at my hair, nearly pulling a few strands out before I felt myself grow tired. No one could resist Santa. I was foolish. He sees you when you’re sleeping; he knows when you’re awake…

I shifted from the couch, walking down the hallway. “Christmas is back on!” My words came from a voice that didn’t seem like my own. I just hoped this joy would wear off. I couldn’t live with this much Christmas joy forever. My words got no response, Santa making sure my family was in a deep sleep before he visited. With a throbbing headache, I got into bed, still hearing those stupid Christmas song lyrics wading through my thoughts as I tried to get some sleep.
