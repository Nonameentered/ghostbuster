“What’s taking him so long? If he doesn’t get here soon, I might die of boredom.” Marcus said. His hands resting behind his neck, trying to get himself comfortable as he laid on the rocky terrain of the underworld. Watching the river Styx float before him with no sign of the Ferryman.


“I don’t think you can die of boredom if you’re already dead. What are you complaining about, anyway? At least you’re at the front of the line. I feel bad for those poor souls at the back. Imagine how long it will be before they get a ride.” Paula looked back at the line, noticing more souls joining the already weeklong queue of bodies.


“It’s an expression. Although I think I might be the first case of a dead person dying if this takes any longer. They could at least bring some complimentary bread or wine to eat while we are waiting.”


“Like at a fancy restaurant? Do souls even get hungry?” Paula wondered that. The whole time she had been waiting here, she hadn’t felt a need to eat or drink. Despite that, the thought of a nice glass of wine grabbed her interest. “I could go for an excellent red wine. Maybe one that has a hint of sweetness to it?”

 
“Or some freshly made bread? It’s probably a good thing we don’t get hungry. I would hate to see how violent a line like this could get if we added hunger and thirst to the mix.”

 
The two let out a sigh, looking longingly at the river. Surely Charon couldn’t be too much longer. From all accounts, the man was rather punctual, never missing a day of work. So, a gap like this had to be causing chaos throughout the underworld. Maybe he had worked long enough to earn himself a break, and they were just the unfortunate souls that died during that break?

 
Another three hours passed before a broad shadowy figure pushed through the fog of the river. Marcus jumped to his feet, edging closer to the water’s edge. It had to be Charon. Who else could traverse the river? As the figure neared, its features became more prominent. A gigantic, towering ship of metal had replaced the once tiny ferry. The deck of this ship having a pool, slides and even a bar. When the ship arrived near the waiting souls, everyone was too stunned to say anything, only staring at the tall figure on the ship’s deck. His glowing purple eyes looking longingly at the water before he turned to face the crowd.

 
“Charon the Ferryman?” Paula asked, being the first to break the stunned silence.


“No, Charon the Yachtman.” The ghostly voice answered.
