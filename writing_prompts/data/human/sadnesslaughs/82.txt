[Part 1 of 2]

Ben tilted down his squared glasses, observing the man before him. “The silent treatment won’t work on me. I’m a psychic investigator. Even if you keep your mouth shut, I’ll still find out exactly what you’re hiding. If you confess now, I’m sure we can work out a plea deal. I hate to admit it, but using my abilities is tiring. It takes me a week to recover after entering someone’s mind. If you can spare me that week of pain, I’ll make it worth your while.”

 

Ben gave the man a friendly smile, hoping that the enticement of a deal might grab his attention. Most intelligent people broke after that. What point was there in challenging a psychic? Even if they resisted, their innermost secrets would eventually be found out. The man, no older than forty, just stared back at Ben, barely even paying attention. Ben might have thought the man was dead, if not for the occasional movement of his eyes as he scanned the room.

 

“Right, silent treatment it is. You have the right to fight any evidence that is uncovered during my investigation. A copy of our findings will be forwarded to your lawyer. If you have yet to be appointed a lawyer, we will keep the report on our records for them. Questions?” Ben gave the standard spiel before picking up his notepad.

 

“First question, where were you on the night of the murder, Jacob?” Ben asked his question, staring the man in the eyes. The two shared a silent bit of eye contact as Ben waited for an image or word to appear in his mind, but nothing came up. It was blank. Giving up on that question, he tried a more direct line of questioning.

 

“I believe you were the one that killed Paul Malarin. Your fingerprints were on the man’s sleeve in what we believe was a revenge attack by a rival gang. Anything to say about that?” Ben stared, even removing his glasses to avoid having anything blocking his sight.

 

Nothing.

 

This had never happened to him before. How could someone have no thoughts going through their head? Sure, some of the smarter criminals would recite lyrics or try to psyche him out, but none could ever pull off this. The mind was a hopelessly honest thing. No matter how much someone tried to cover their thoughts, the truth would eventually slip. With how much information passes through the human brain every second, it’s impossible to disrupt the flow of thoughts forever. 

Ben watched the dead expression of the man. Even now, his eyes were the only things moving, continuing to glance around the room without purpose. How could he be looking without processing what was around him? Ben knocked on the two-way mirror, pressing his cheek against it. “Can we get a scan done? Or any sort of test that might tell me if his mind’s being messed with?”

 

A dull thud was the only response Ben got. The person on the other side letting him know his words had been acknowledged. “Something’s not right here. If I were a betting man, I would say that you were dead.” Jacob only continued his gaze, leaving Ben to lean back in his chair, awaiting the other officers.

 

After using his abilities, Ben would usually experience a sharp pain behind his retina’s, but today he felt nothing. He hadn’t been able to get into the other’s head, or maybe there was nothing for him to get inside of? When the officers took Jacob away, Ben went and prepared a coffee. He wasn’t certain what would turn up in their findings, but he expected the worst.

 

Ten hours passed before Ben received a call. The voice on the other side let out a long sigh, leaving them with a moment of silence before speaking. “This is Officer Pauline; I’m calling to update you about our findings on Jacob Richardson. I believe you were investigating him?”

 

“That’s correct. Have you got any results? A CT scan or something for me to look at?” Ben tapped at his shirt pocket, sliding his notepad out, placing it on the table, getting ready to take notes.

 

“We do. I’ll forward the results shortly, but I need to discuss something that came up in the CT scan first.”

 

“Sure, what did you find?” The tip of Ben’s pen tapped against the paper, leaving a few black splotches of ink as he awaited the answer to his mystery.

 

“We found a chip. We aren’t certain how the chip got in there, but we believe it’s linked to his unusual brain activity. A possible blocker on brain activity?”

“A chip? You need to be more descriptive. Are we talking about something more cylinder shaped? Metallic or rubbery? Any electrical signals?”

“We don’t know. The scan hasn’t given us much to go off. A chip is just our current theory. We were hoping to take him in for surgery, but his lack of responses has made that difficult. No lawyer would ever agree to it, and we don’t have enough evidence to claim its necessary. Hell, even if we knew he was the murderer, we wouldn’t be able to get it approved. Do you want to question him again? I don’t think we will get anymore chances after this.”

 

“That might be for the best. Have you noticed anything usual? Strange noises or out of character behavior?”

 

“Only the movement of his eyes. He keeps looking around at everything. It’s rather creepy, given he never speaks.” He could hear her tone get a little higher as she said that. A slight chill running up her spine as she recounted the stares.

 

“Right, send me through the information and your location. I’ll meet up with you shortly. Can you make sure we have some equipment set up for the interview, too? Even if it’s just a phone to record things.” Ben ended the call, looking at his near empty notepad. Only a few obvious notes being jotted down, offering him little to go off.

 

When the information came through, he checked the hospital room number before calling for a cab. He couldn’t waste any time. Ben reading through the files from the backseat of the cab. The CT scan showed an object near the frontal lobe, but what the object was could be anything. Its rounded shape added to the chip theory, but Ben didn’t feel convinced, at least not without gathering more information.
