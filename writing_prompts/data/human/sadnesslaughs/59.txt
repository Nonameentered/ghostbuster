“How do you handle it?” Melissa turned to her human friend, watching as he ordered another ale. To think the two had met as young adults only twenty years ago and he was already showing signs of his age. His once stunning dark hair had lost its color, falling into a more dried and deserted grey. Even his eyes, that were once filled with hope, were now weighed down by the stresses of life.

 

“The injuries? I get these all the time, its part of being an adventurer. You just keep drinking until it stops hurting. It’s not a great long-term plan, but what human ever thinks about that. I won’t be there for it.” Alex gave a small chuckle, only to cut the chuckle short when he saw the glare Melissa gave him.

 

“I’m being serious. This isn’t about the injuries, although I do wish you would let me look at them while we are on the subject. You know I have healing magic, right?” Melissa reached out for his bandaged arm, only for Alex to pull it away. Grabbing the freshly poured ale that the bartender had placed for him.

 

“I know, but it feels weird. I know elves are used to magic, but it makes humans feel all weird. Our bodies aren’t used to it. Every time I get my body healed, it goes numb for a month, which isn’t a good thing while adventuring. That’s how you end up wandering into a trap or not noticing a monster just stabbed your back. I prefer to only use a healer when I’m mortally wounded.”

 

“I see. Maybe in the next hundred years you will adapt to it?”

 

“Melissa, I won’t be around in the next hundred years. Sure, maybe if I have a kid, they might be fortunate enough to adapt to it, but for me, it’s just out of reach.”

 

“Oh, right. Sorry.” Melissa stared at the same glass of wine she had been nursing since she entered. She wasn’t much of a drinker, only buying the wine so the bartender wouldn’t give her a dirty look for taking up space in the tavern.

 

“It’s fine. What did you want to ask? Something about how I handle it?”

 

“It would be rude of me to ask. Just forget about it. You had a long day, right? You deserve a rest.” Melissa’s right ear gave a small twitch, a usual sign that she was holding something back. Alex had picked up on it long ago, not needing hundreds of years to pick up on the social cues that someone was upset.

“Melissa. Come on, ask away. I know you elves are curious creatures. What did you want to know? I’m an open book when you’re the one asking. I’ll tell you anything.”

 

Melissa hesitated, keeping her gave on the golden liquid in her glass. After a moment of thought, she took a long sip of the wine and turned back to her friend.

 

“How do you handle living such a short life? Does it not scare you? Elves will often know their great grandfathers, and yet you will most likely be forgotten before I even pass away. Does that not worry you? How do you cope with that?”

 

Alex looked at Melissa, unsure how to answer that. Her pale cheeks had a hint of red, feeling awkward for asking such a personal question. It didn’t help that Alex just kept staring at her, in deep thought about the best way to summarise his feelings.

 

“You just keep drinking until it stops hurting.” He said, giving her a hearty laugh, only for her to turn her face away from in a huff. “Oh, come on, I’m kidding. I thought it would break the tension a little.”

 

Melissa didn’t return her gaze, staring off at a dingy corner of the tavern, watching two dwarven men as they downed their booze, merrily singing to one another.

 

“I’m sorry. It’s a weird thing to talk about. I can’t help but make a joke. If you want my real answer, then yes, at times it does scare me. There’s this world out there that I’ll never get to see. All these wonderful experiences that I’ll never get to try. I hear elves talk about spending their youth searching the world travelling north, south and whatever direction tickles their fancy and I envy that. As a human, you get maybe five years of your adult youth to find yourself before being locked into a job. Sure, being an adventurer gives you more freedom, but that freedom is still restrictive. I can only go as far as my coin pouch will allow me.”

 

Melissa turned back, staring at Alex. It was rare for him to be scared of anything. The only time she had seen him scared was that brief time after he had lost his mother. That was the only time she had seen him ever look lost in life and yet here he was, that nonchalant human admitting he feared his death. 
“Elves often envy humans. You can produce such brilliant feats in a short span of time. A great human warrior is made even greater by the fact they had to gain their power in their limited life. Sure, elves have great warriors too, but our youngest warriors are still around two hundred by the time they get written into our records. Did you know some elves even want to live shorter lives?”

 

“Those elves are fools that don’t understand the advantage they have. If fate is kind to them, they get to experience a long life with those they love. Often the people I love are taken away from me before I’m ready to let go of them. There’s not much dignity in human death, often illness or some other misfortunate takes us before we even get to old age. Still, it’s not all bad. You won’t die on me. So, I’ll always have one friend.”

 

Alex gave her a smile, which she quickly returned. He had a way of turning around those bleak moments. Maybe elves needed to rethink how they viewed human mortality. A silence fell between the two as Alex returned to his drink. During the silence, however, Melissa felt a need to speak up.

 

“Perhaps you’re right. I did always feel the envy was a little foolish. Although you’re a pretty amazing human, and you have done a lot more than I have in your short life, so I can see why they think that.”

 

“It won’t take you long to outshine me. I’m not sure if there is an afterlife or anything, but if there is, I’ll keep an eye on you. Jeez, this conversation is bringing my mood down. Can we lighten it up a little? I’m not good at all this serious talk.”

 

“I would appreciate that. Oh, if you have any children, I’ll be sure to speak to them about you. Have you found a partner yet? Come on, I want to be a grandparent.” Melissa gave him a playful nudge, earning a groan from Alex. 

“Now you sound like my dad. Why would me having a kid make you a grandparent, anyway? It would make you a godparent or something. Look, I don’t plan on settling down with anyone, not like adventurers are very popular with the ladies. People look for a partner that won’t get their head chopped off by a group of goblins or kidnapped by a harpy. Maybe when I retire.”

 

“Nonsense. I know a lot of single elven ladies that would love to be with a human. They love the tragedy of holding their old lover’s arm while he passes, recalling all their memories together. It’s really romantic.” Melissa let out a sigh, thinking of how magical that sounded, while Alex gave her a look of disgust.

“I would prefer not to be a person’s tragic backstory, thanks.”

 

“Right, right. Sorry, some people are into that romantic sort of thing. Just thought I would tell you.” Melissa said, a sheepish smirk on her face.

 

“Romantic? I don’t consider my death romantic. Well, maybe if it’s like one of those books where they are holding my wounded body, crying out for a mage as I bleed out. That could be romantic.” Alex joked, only to regret it when he saw Melissa perk up in her seat.

 

“Elder Gloria has said she would love to feel the tragic loss of a short love. Should I let her know you are-“

 

“NO!” Alex stopped her before she could get too far ahead of herself, watching as Melissa sunk back into her seat. 
“I just want a normal death, not something out of a book. Even If I die without a partner, I’ll be fine. I have people I care about like you. Other humans may forget me, but I’ll live on through you, right? You won’t forget me, will you? If you do, I’ll haunt you.”

 

Alex leant in as he said that last part, making a small wooo sound that caused Melissa to shiver in her seat. Her hands hit his chest, pushing him away before she got too creeped out by the thought.

 

“Of course, I’ll always remember you. Just know if you do try to haunt me, I’ll get someone to cleanse my home of you. I hear that’s quite painful for a ghost.” She said, making sure that would deter him from the idea.

 

“You’re kidding right, you wouldn’t do that to me, would you?” Melissa stayed silent, prompting Alex to ask again. “Right?”

 

The two stared at one another before sharing a laugh, returning to their idle chatter, enjoying the small time they would get to share together.
