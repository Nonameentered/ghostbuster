“Joe, what even is your job anymore? I don’t mean to be rude, but at this point our police department is made up of whatever freak decides they want to solve a crime. Last week we had a child and his robotic friend solve a crime. You let a child and a robot go into a drug den. You should be thankful they got out of there alive.” Mayor Gurdy rubbed his forehead, staring at the newspaper clippings scattered over his desk. Trying to make sense of the strange stories.

 

“They not only got out alive, but they also stopped the operation. It was damn fine police work.” Joe took a long swig of his flask, already having a slight wobble to his step.

 

“Joe. That’s not the point. Police work is something you need to be trained in. You can’t just let any vigilante enforce the law. Don’t you have any sense of pride for your badge? How long has it been since you went out and stopped a crime?” Gurdy continued to scan the headlines between his words, stopping on a headline that caught his eye. ‘Man dressed as cat, licks armed robber into surrender.’ He didn’t even want to bring up that headline with the commissioner.

 

“I don’t have time. I must let out the signal, make sure everyone knows there is a crime happening. Without my symbol, this city would fall. I am the pillar of this community.” Joe said, drool leaking from the edge of his lip as he stumbled towards the desk, slouching against it. “Oh, Catman. That sandpaper tongue of his sure gave that villain a licking.”

 

Gurdy shivered at that phrasing. “Villain? These are criminals, not villains. The man was just trying to rob a petrol station, not take over the world. Please tell me you aren’t treating these people as supervillains. Oh, Joe. I’m sorry, but sending out a signal just isn’t enough of a job to keep your position. I’m going to have to let you go. I can get you some help? There’s a rehab clinic across the state that deals with cases like yours. I’ll pay your fees.”

 

“If Catman wasn’t there to lick the villain, who knows what might have happened. It’s like Schrödinger’s Catman. Who knows what would have been in that box of crime?”

Gurdy didn’t know how to respond to that. For the first time in his political career, someone stumped him. He was certain the Schrödinger’s cat reference made little sense in this scenario, trying to steer the conversation away from it. “How about you just try rehab for a week? If you don’t like it, we can try something else? Maybe give you an office job.”

 

“An office job? Over my dead, bloated corpse. The city needs me. I’m also the only one that knows the passwords to all the devices in the office. You can figure them out eventually, but do you really want to go through all that hassle? Imagine a week without being able to operate the computers and databases. Not even Catman could save you then.”

 

“WHAT IS IT WITH YOU AND CATMAN?” Gurdy stood up from his chair, face red with rage. “Catman this and Catman that. What is so good about Catman?”

 

Joe moved to the mayor’s side, patting his shoulder. He leaned in closer, whispering into his ear. “Keep this between us, but I’m Catman. Your city’s protector is also his commissioner.” Joe tried to wink, but his eye only twitched, the acholic breath stinging the mayor’s senses before Joe finally moved away.

 

“You’re the Catman? Why would you lick a criminal? Ugh. Joe, what am I going to do with you?” Gurdy pushed aside the articles, spotting one that made Joe smile. ‘Crime rate drops fifty percent!’

 

“Nothing. My strategy works. I only hire the first people I see before breakfast. That’s how I know I have the best workers. No one that isn’t a good worker gets up that early. None of my heroes have died and we solve crime. Why would you remove me?”

 

“Ok, look. I can turn a blind eye to this. You get results, but no more letting any meddling kids roam crime scenes. That’s a recipe for disaster. If you can do that, I think we can continue working together.” Gurdy had given up. He couldn’t change the commissioner’s mind, so he would just roll with it.

“Excellent. I’m glad you understand me so well, Mayor. You should see our newest recruits. We have Marvo, the mysterious fortune teller. He gets five out of ten predictions right. If you tell him the name of the person and give him ten minutes on a computer. We also have Lily the mime. Well, we had Lily. She forgot the key to her mime box, so she’s kind of stuck at this point. Oh, we also-“

 

“Please, don’t tell me anymore. I don’t want to know.” Mayor Gurdy smacked his forehead against his desk, sending the news articles around the room. “Just keep getting results, please, before I rethink my decision.”

 

“Sure, thing, mayor. Have a good evening, or as Catman says. Have a purrfect night.” With that, Joe rushed out of the room, leaving Gurdy to rest his sore forehead against the desk.

 

“Why couldn’t I have gotten the job in another city? I doubt anyone else has to deal with this.” He groaned.
