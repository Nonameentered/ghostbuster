Part 4

"And oh my god," Tina said, laughing as they walked back up the stone steps. "I thought I didn't like calamari. It was so good with that sauce."

"Yep," Agent Paradise said. "You just have to get it fresh. Let's see how the porridge is thickening."

She knocked on the heavy door. "Best to tread lightly. Things can get weird with the young ones while they experiment. Follow any directions I give you immediately."

Tina nodded.

"Come in," a single Gabe offered from inside, voice straining.

Agent Paradise smirked as she opened the door and looked up to see Gabe floating about six feet off the ground, tumbling on the verge of losing his balance on the nothing below his feet.

Another Gabe was referencing a book while jabbing his arm in and out of a wall. A crackling burst drew Tina's attention to further down the stacks to a wide space she hadn't noticed before where several Gabes were hurling and blocking lightning bolts back and forth.

"Complete the reading assignment, young man?" Paradise asked, focusing on the Gabe now gliding down to meet them. He looked younger, maybe just because his acne was gone.

"Yep, luckily I got a good understanding of the Swathe right after you guys left," the Gabe said. He looked down at his pants and all the dirt and dust fell to the floor with a light thump. "I was able to expand out, focus on a page spread per instance. I've been practicing a few things since then. This one's on Brownian motion of air molecules, pretty tricky."

"And you haven't ran out of energy yet?" Agent Paradise asked, tapping a table that had gone mostly transparent like glass streaked with ghost wisps of wood grain. "No headache, fatigue, nausea?"

Gabe looked at her like she asked if he grew a third leg. "Not at all. I feel great."

Paradise raised her eyebrows and frowned. "Anyway, you want some lunch before we head back out?"

"Gabe," Tina said. "You're gonna love this. They have these little curled up cookie taco things that taste like-"

A massive thump knocked several books off the walls.

The door back to the rest stop opened and Sader poked his head in, all business again. "Four extra planar entities starting a ruckus out here."

"Alright," Paradise said, taking a pocket watch from her suit and handing it to Tina. "Do you have any fillings?"

Tina shook her head. "I had a retainer until a couple years ago."

"Fabulous. Click the top and you'll turn into unmovable stone for one minute. Wait until you need it. It's not the most comfortable sensation."

With a whiff of smoke, the extra Gabes disappeared. "He's back for me, isn't he?"

"And he's brought some friends. I don't think bananas are going to cut it. You ready for round two?" Paradise cracked open a vial in her hands before working it through her hair, glass shards and all.

Gabe nodded slowly and followed her through the threshold just as another blast rocked the library, tipping the glass wood table to burst into shards.

Tina clutched the watch. Engraved on the side was 'Pigeon, May this keep you safer than it did me.' She stepped through into chaos.
