Phil had to crouch slightly to fit all eight hairy legs inside the cubicle. The 7 foot 2 sentient arachnid chittered apologetically. I shook my head.

"We really like to keep the processed reports face up in the outgoing bin, mkay?" Krystal said, blinking as she sipped her tea. Her sighs got louder and louder as she flicked through the stack at Phil's desk. "It just makes more sense so people can see what they're grabbing. We don't want to make anyone else's job harder."

"That's literally not a thing, Krystal," I said over the grey wall. She bunched the sleeves of her cardigan over her elbows.  "Been working here six years and never had anyone care about if the reports were flipped as long as they all were in the bin." I smiled with all the cordiality I could muster.

"Well." Krystal scrunched her nose. "This is clearly distracting others from their work either way." She leaned under Phil, snooping over his cubicle. The only decoration was a framed 4 by 6 of 500 or so small spiders crawling along a fence post.

"If I'm distracted, it's by you, not him," I said, walking past with my water bottle. "What are you doing?"

"I'm just looking for," she paused to gauge my reaction. "Webs," she added with thinly veiled disgust.

Phil pushed his keyboard away and chittered urgently for several seconds.

"Well how am I supposed to know tarantulas only use silk to line their burrows? Why are you mad?" Krystal asked quizzically. "I'm not a etymologist. Let's all just get back to work. I take the quarterly deadlines seriously, don't know about you guys."

"Then maybe you should go back to your desk, considering you have the same job as us and bothering new people isn't part of it," I offered.

Phil chittered as he typed with the thin claws at the ends of four legs while leaning back on the other four.

"Wow, you can really hammer it out," I said to Phil. "You might have finished the most reports today."

Krystal harrumphed softly as she turned and left.

"Ignore her, dude," I said, shaking my head. "She's just speciesist, plain as day."

Phil chittered sadly, tapping a paper on the desk. It was a new colleague onboarding form. Krystal's bubbly writing was all over it in red ink.

"Oh my god," I said, looking it over and throwing it down. "Again, none of this matters. She's just making up rules. She's trying to get you fired. Come on. Let's go."

Phil tsk tsked, towering over me, fangs glistening. I had to get this guy on the work basketball team.

"To HR," I answered.

"Whatever it means, it’s made you feel uncomfortable," the HR rep said. "You’re in a situation that, from your perspective, is a no-win for you and is hampering your onboarding. Let's go ahead and get Krystal-"

The door slammed open behind Phil. A man in a ratty untucked dress shirt waved a gun around. "You dumb witch," he slurred. "I bet you didn't think I would do it, huh, come to your work? You think you can keep my kids from me? And now you're hanging out with their kind?"

"Todd!" the HR rep yelled, throwing up her hands. "You're drunk!"

Phil and I looked back and forth between the pair. I patted my pockets. I had left my phone at my desk.

"Dude," I whispered to Phil. "Do you have your phone to call 911?"

"That's what it takes," the maniac squealed. "I can't look at your sorry fucking face unless I'm-"

The man fell to the floor, twitching. Two large spots swelled up on his face. The bite had been too fast to see. Phil plopped down 200 pounds of hairy spider abdomen on top of the man. The gun went sliding to the far end of the room.

"Absolutely savage, my guy." I held out a hand for a sutble low five, or whatever the spider equivalent was. Phil tapped it and chittered.

The HR rep was already on the phone with the police but burst out laughing at Phil's joke.
