"Dreams are like rainbows, Steven," the digital voice crooned. "It's all a matter of perspective. Rain and sun. Suffering and hope."

Steven nodded quickly, popping the welder's mask down before laying another line across the chassis armor. He shook the frame, grunting with satisfaction then slid the wires and computer into the back. Everything fit perfectly.

"It's done, INSPIRO-bot." He grabbed the table to help himself stand. He tipped up the mask again to look up at his work. He had trouble believing he built something so large, so flawless. "Your body's complete. I could have never finished it without your motivation."

"If there's no one left to hope," INSPIRO-bot said, fresh servos whirling as it rose to it's full seven feet, "there is no one left to suffer."

"Huh," Steven said, quirking a singed eyebrow. "I've never heard that one."

The fist of the robot slammed through Steven's face and the wall behind him. "In the absence of suffering, comes peace."
