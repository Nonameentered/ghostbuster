The sparrow sank into the rosy snow, letting the feeling of bloodless chill seep up its thin legs. He picked down, plunging past the drying blossom leaves, eyes closed against the burning powdered ice.

With a hard bite upon finding what he sought, he fluttered away, leaving mirrored feather drags stamped across the white. 

Repositioning the thin ring to better sit in his beak, the sparrow rose and glided away from the park. He recognized the building once he was close and slowed himself to land atop the windowsill, illuminated in the early evening by flickering candlelight, no doubt an apartment violation.

The woman within sat reading and the sparrow gave himself a handful of breaths to watch her before he tapped on the thick glass.

She looked up curious toward the window, tilting her head as she rested her book upside down on the couch, careful of her place.

"Hello little birdie," she said, smiling. "I don't have any food. What have you got there?"

The sparrow took a hopping step back as she cracked the window. The cinnamon warmth within rushed out to waste itself against the early winter air. The sparrow sat the ring on the inside.

"That's mine. How could you have known that?" The woman held the band up against the light, lips parted, tracing the inscription.

The sparrow flooded in, looking about her apartment and finding it too sparse for what he wanted. He landed beside her book and began the arduous task of flipping it over.

"Hey," she said, snatching the book easily. The sparrow landed on the page and she dropped the book with a squeak. He tapped and bit bits of page off, shaking to rip them off before arranging the freed letters carefully on the floor.

The woman squatted to look down at the message the Sparrow had made. "Rulia. Either this is the biggest coincidence or you're not a bird at all."

The Sparrow looked up at her then set to work on a second message.

"Hundreds of us left," she read as he worked. "lost ability to change, stuck in form of animal we were when magic died. How you still same?"

"I was lucky, little bird," she said. "or unlucky depending on how you look at it. After thousands of years, I grew tired and took this form to rest again, my oldest. When the magic died, I was stuck as well but as a human."

The Sparrow flew up to her shoulder as rubbed against her cheek, pressing his weight there. In this act, he gave his name, seeing the light in her eyes, warmer still.

"I've missed you, too," Rulia said, cradling a gentle hand around his wing. She bagan to hum a song the Sparrow hadn't heard since before all was undone and he felt at peace.
