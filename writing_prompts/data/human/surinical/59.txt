You awake, head-splitting. You are seated in a dark room with no knowledge of how you got here. You cannot move. You strain to investigate the opposite wall with a grid of pulsing ropes.

A voice projects down. You cannot turn your head up to see the source.

"Student F4G, Please stand by."

A bright light shines from the wall as the voice cuts off, illuminating the room, seeming like the insides of some animal, flesh, and veins.

A hologram of an attractive older woman's face appears.

"I am Doctor Barret. The world you know is a lie. Humanity has advanced far beyond the sheltered Earth, which functionally serves us now as little more than breeding stock.

"You are given a higher calling. We will now proceed with a test to determine how best you will serve the HDON. Though bizarre, these questions are so designed by top psychological profilers to correctly perceive FP- functional personality. Please indulge me."

A light flickers and the hologram is replaced with a silent video of a tan-skinned man writhing on a white linoleum floor, hands cut off, stumps pawing at a noose around his neck. A person offscreen is forcing a yellow tube into his mouth. Yellow fluid trickles down either side of his mouth as he chokes.

You gag, feeling sour bile rise up but are still frozen in your seat.

"Please answer each question in whatever succinct matter you feel most appropriate," The woman says, unmoved.

The screen changes to a list of questions:

1. Would this video bother you more or less if the victim was a dog, rather than a man?
2. Would this video bother you more or less if it included sound?
3. Would this video bother you more or less if the victim was a woman, rather than a man?
4. What country would you guess this video was filmed in? Why?

“Uh, do I get out of here if I answer?” No reply comes.

“Fine, the same, more, more, No clue, Brazil?”

"Excellent, thank you." Barret's face returns in front of you. She is checking something out of frame but returns her attention to you after a few moments. "Moving on."

With a wet lurch, the flesh wall opens and a person enters, dressed head-to-toe in draping loose white garments. They let go of a tray they are carrying. It hangs in the air weightlessly. Two glasses filled with white liquid sit on the tray. The person turns without acknowledging you and exits through the hole in the hole, which seals shut behind them.

"Drinking from one of these glasses will cause you excruciating pain for 10 hours. No help will be given to you during this time. Drinking from the other glass will cause you to enter a coma-like consciousness where the feeling of twenty days passing in empty blackness will occur, leaving you alone with your thoughts. This only takes 10 hours of real-world time.

"You will be forced to drink one of these two liquids, but you are allowed to choose which."

The ropes release you to your decision. No longer bound and with a clever plan established, you reach for the left glass, the coma drink. You hesitate. But how can you be sure that's the coma drink? You've not had it yet and the two look the same. Yet, you are sure, the right is pain, a sickening fire that starts in your guts and radiates out in every direction. How?

The answer hits you in the face. You've done this before. You've done this whole series of a hundred questions more than once. You're vaguely aware of the cold, chalky taste. They are torturing you or training you for something.

They don't control you. You swipe out your hand to knock both glasses off the table.

But wait, You'll show them. You grab both glasses as you hear a distant shattering and chug them both. "Put that in your fucking notes," you yell, slamming down the empty glasses.

You sit back in your chair and feel the heat in your chest work up, the pain keeping the sleeping effect from hitting you. But, did you drink them? You just had a sip. No, you knocked them on the floor. You feel nothing.

You turn back to see the glasses flickering between being mostly full, empty, then gone. You cry out as the pain begins in earnest, but it's different, almost like its pain that could be, not that is. The hell is this?

You focus on the glasses flickering on the ground, the pool of white liquid around them, and let that reality be true. The pain is gone instantly.

"What the...Hold on," Barret says to someone else off-camera. "Micheals, get over here and confirm what I'm seeing."

A calm man wanders beside her, half his face in the frame, pointing at an unseen screen. "Yeah, looks like a standard split tree. Three chronologies, then they collapse on the safest. Good job, Barret, that's why they pay you the big bucks. I didn't think you'd been working on a Quantum Surgeon since we left Almadie. This one looks done. We can gear him up and have him in the antibiotic squad next week."

"That's the thing, I haven't. We just pulled the kid this morning. This is his fourth loop." Barret says.

The man's visible eye raises up. "Holy shit, that's not possible." He takes something from her and steps away.

She follows him, leaving a hologram of only her chair.

You sit, dazed but feeling fine, no urge to sleep, no pain. The white-draped person enters again.

"Your testing is complete. Please stand," she asks.

You feel a rush of energy as you do so, your heartbeat in time with the pulsing of the walls. What the fuck is happening to you?

The person pulls out a set of handcuffs and gestures for you to turn around.
