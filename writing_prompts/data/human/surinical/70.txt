Part 10:

“So I lost my temper and I was ashamed of it,” Bart said. “So I lied. I'm sorry. Now give me the fucking statue before I come take it.”
  

  
“Lying still,” Peter produced a small stream of flame, hovering it over the statue.
  

  
“You'll kill us all if you do that.” Bart began walking towards him, ax dragging along the ground.
  

  
“Then tell me the truth and I won't have to do it,” Pete answered with no fear.
  

  
“Want the truth?” Bart yelled, turning to address Michael as well. “You're so fucking short-sighted, the lot of you. Do you see the grandeur of this place? This could be our house, we could rule as a warrior Kings, every pleasure this exotic world has brought to us on golden trays.”
  

  
“The woman demon of the woods called to me in my dreamings.” Bart said, resting his ax on the half wall. “I answered her invitation to come here. She asked what I wanted. I told her I wanted to be strong and I wanted my sons to be strong. She told me if I found the statue I could call my sons here, and their sons and she would make us all strong. All I had to do was bring her the statue back after. If I don’t, then she will kill us all. This strength is a debt we must repay.”
  

  
“I saw how nice this was when the king brought me here and showed me all the splendor. He was nice enough to even show me the statue when I asked. There sat his daughter, praying. When I tried to take it, she screamed. I slapped her just to shut her up and made my wish. I was thorough. I gave you each enough time to have your son grow up strong and then I brought you to me, to the demon to receive blessings of your own.”
  

  
“The guards found me there,” Bart said. “I managed to take out a few, flee with my life but not the statue, but I knew my sons would come and they would be strong and we would have another chance to repay our debt.”
  

  
“I don't want to be here in this world,” Pete the Elder said, turning back to stare at his father. “I don't want this power. I want to rest.” 
  

  
“Then rest,” Bart said, dashing to grab the ax. Michael tackled him just as he threw the ax, chopping off Pete’s hand.
  

  
Bart spun, getting on top of Michael and punching him back and forth. A wave of fire spurted out, covering Bart. He turns to kick Pete and bash his remaining hand to pulp.
  

  
Michael felt the change coming but Bart was on him again, choking him. “I’d rather kick your ass like this.”
  

  
Blackness roiled in the edges of Michael’s vision. Each hammering fist kept the bear away.
  

  
"I knew you were soft, even in that big suit,” Bart said, punctuating with punches. “You would give up all this for a nagging woman and a son that’s probably weaker than you in the life of a peasant when you could have been a fucking King.”
  

  
A hammer crushed into Bart’s head from behind. “Whoo, I done told you what was coming. I should’ve listened to my gut and whooped your ass back at the bar. You don’t even want to go home, do you, you mad bastard? You mean to trap us here.” Pete the Younger glowed gold, hefting his hammer.
  

  
“I'm tougher than all of you,” Bart screamed, bleeding from the ears and eyes as he stumbled back. “You are ungrateful shits. Look at the Castle I took for you. I will hold each of you down and make you thank me before I beat as much sense into you as I have to.” He grabbed his ax and swung wildly, almost falling over. “This is our fucking Castle! This is our fucking home now!”
  

  
Pete the Elder grabbed him from behind with his ruined limbs, squeezing him in a bear hug.
  

  
“All you ever did, Pa,” Pete said, managing to hold the lunatic still, “was exactly what you wanted to do. Then you’d make us feel guilty like it was for us when we never asked for none of it. You should have came home to the wife and boy that needed you, loved you, but that ain't you. It never was.”
  

  
“Fuck you, you bed pissing shit!” Bart yelled.
  

  
Pete let himself fall back, taking his father with him. They fell in silence down and down into the darkness of the ravine.
  

  
“I feel like I missed a lot,” Douglas said, limping to the top of the stairs, carrying a sack, spilling with gold. “That was Dad and Bart?”
  

  
“Yeah,” Michael said. “I’m sorry.”
  

  
Douglas shook his head, tears welling. “We just rub his thing, genie lamp style or what?”
  

  
“Is there a mechanism of some kind?” Dad asked, tipping the statue and looking underneath. “Like a crank?”
  

  
Michael stepped between them, licking his finger and then rubbing across the forehead of the strange dog figure. 
  

  
There was the sound of a door slam and all was black.
