“Oh, that does sound good,” Frank said as he walked into the cramped and screen-illuminated room. “ I don’t know if I’m a growing boy anymore, vertically anyways, hah.” He held the amulet around his neck. “Okay, yep. I gotta go…un huh. Yep. I know it. Alright.” He pulled the necklace off and tossed it in the box.
  

  
“Got another one, I see,” Malik said without looking up from his game of minesweeper. 
  

  
“Yup, in conference C, they had one of those baking competitions today,” Frank said, dropping the amulet in the cardboard box in the corner with a tink. “Guy tried to sneak in his grandmother. With that bigwig art auction today, they don’t want any problems popping up so they were doing full checks down there. They caught a guy cheating in the chess tournament too but it wasn’t a necklace. Told them I wouldn’t touch that thing.”
  

  
“Ah, so kind of a ratatouille situation with the grandma,” Malik said, glancing back to the array of screens. “We’re building up a pretty good collection of lost relative possessed objects.” The northwest entryway cameras, inside and outside, displayed only static. Malik lifted himself up and tapped on the display.
  

  
“Hey, Frank, will you go and check out the northwest door? Probably a bad fuse.” Malik said, carefully deciding where to click.
  

  
“I just got on shift. You’ve been farting in that chair for hours. You go check it,” Frank snapped, very unlike him.
  

  
Malik clicked, right over a bomb, ending the hereto flawless game. “Fine by me,” he said, gathering up his flashlight and keycard.
  

  
Frank was already furiously typing some e-mail. “Okay then.”
  

  
Malik walked to the elevator and stopped. He could see the northwest door from the interior balcony. Faster would be just to peak over there and make sure there wasn’t any suspicious business then just call IT about the cameras.
  

  
He scratched his back on the corner of the hallway before leaning over the balcony. Seven men in black masks were pulling in some type of large cart. Three of them had guns, aiming down the hallway in front of them.
  

  
"Shit shit shit," Malik whispered, hauling as much ass as he could back to the security room.
  

  
He threw open the door and ran inside. "Frank, we got a- Frank?"
  

  
All the monitors were fuzzy now. Frank was nowhere to be seen. The door clicked closed behind him, revealing a note in Frank's sloppy scrawl.
  

  
\-Sorry, Malik. Just stay here and don't try to break the door and they won't hurt you.-
  

  
Malik immediately tried the handle. It snapped off in his hand.
  

  
"Shit, shit," he repeated, scrambling to the desk. The computer was fried. There was no dial tone on his phone. Gunfire echoed through the hallways outside. He had to do something.
  

  
His eyes darted around the room, landing on the cardboard box in the corner.
  

  
After a few minutes, six watches ran up either arm. He wore nine necklaces with several sets of earrings hanging from them. Four belts crisscrossed his midsection, secured with a large broach. The rest he managed to shove in his pockets.
  

  
“Okay!” he shouted over the cacophony rising in his head.
  

  
“I don’t know about you but in-”
  

  
“Well, the last time I saw him was-
  

  
“-at least six foot tall, at least. That boy otta-”
  

  
“I need help!” Malik shouted.
  

  
“Well, there’s no need to yell, dear.”
  

  
“What do you need, sweetie?”
  

  
“There’s a time when a man needs a good-”
  

  
“Do any of you know how to break down a door?” Malik asked.
  

  
“Uh yep,” an old man’s voice said.”Square your shoulders with your hip. No a little bit closer, you want your back to still be straight when you connect…”
  

  
The door slammed open back into the hallway.
  

  
“I only fired this thing a couple of times in training,” Malik said, drawing the pistol.
  

  
“She’s a beaut!”
  

  
“Yeah, that one’ll just about fire herself! We’ll help you out!”
  

  
Malik felt his grip on the pistol steady and relax. He gripped his flashlight under with a backward hold in the other hand.
  

  
“Doors and corners, kid. That’s how they’ll get you. Head to the edge and work your way in.”
  

  
Malik pressed the button on the elevator, a legion chatting in his ear.
