"And why do we have to go down there?" Churt asked, hefting the sack of gold over his armored shoulder. "I would say we've got more than enough from this dungeon already."

"More than enough is right," Peeve added, raising an eyebrow and gesturing around the party. "Each of those goblin swords is worth some money in town and we can't even carry out all of them. Why keep going?"

"Just one more level guys. There's something I need down there." Datrick crossed his hands. "The Macaw of naming."

"You want us to risk our life for some stupid bird?" Gerny asked, not looking away from posing two goblin corpses beside each other in chairs. "I'm in!"

Gerny galavanted down the stairs and, by the sounds below, immediately initiated combat with the next group of enemies.

The rest of the party hurried down the stairs smacking Datrick on the back of the head as they went. 

The goblins had confined a mountain troll to the small space. Poor thing looked like it had never stood upright in it's life. This would be a perfect time for an Eldridge Blast but Datrick wouldn't be here if he could do that.

Peeve got up on the thing's back and began a gruesomely slow process of decapitation. "Sorry, still recovering from the last room. My knives are getting pretty dull." 

"It's a certified huge beast moment, for sure," Gerny said, bashing two goblin's skulls together. "If I finish it off with my storied blade, I'll get extra damage against trolls."

The battle was already winding down and Datrick spotted what he was looking for. The bird sat in a cage, hanging over an underground river running through the dungeon.

"What do you need to know the name of so bad?" Churt asked, knocking a goblin over that tried to surprise attack.

"My patron," Datrick said, Olympian shoulders slumped with embarrassment. "We're 6 months past when it would be awkward to ask. He must have told it to me the first time I communicated with him, but I can't remember. He's done so much for me, help me to become a powerful warlock, travel with all of you. I can only refer to him as my leige, my Lord, or my master for so long before he'll realize."

"Huh," Churt said. "Well I'm curious now too. Hey magic bird! What's the name of Datrick's patron?"

"Raa, Mynameis, Raa!" the bird offered, picking its foot with its beak.

"Oooh," Datrick said. "I thought he was saying 'my name is' and then trailing off, very frustrating."

The poor troll behind them bellowed in agony again. Datrick turned and let loose an Eldritch blast. "By the dark will of Mynameis!"

"Hey," Gerny said. "That was mine!"
