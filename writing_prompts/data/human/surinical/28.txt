“Well, you’re certainly not the usual type to stumble into a place like this.” The dark-haired woman stared Raymond up and down. She was taller than him, probably even without her tiptoe shoes.

He spat to the side and kicked his boots before crossing the threshold into the strangely glowing room. “Don’t think of myself as that special, all things considered.”

Gas lamps shaped like curling tubes spelled out words he didn’t know inside. The smoke looked thicker near the glow of ‘Ice Cold Bud Light’ and ‘EPP Ego Drip, Always Smooth.’

The woman smirked as she followed his eyes. “Nocta Fortis is a place out of time. It will serve you best to ignore the bits that confuse you, rather than dwell on them.”

“Fair enough, whatever the hell that means. Been ignoring things I don’t understand my whole life,” Raymond said as he leaned against the bar and held up two fingers. “No reason to stop now.”

The woman crossed her legs as she hopped up on the stool beside him. She tapped on a square of glass mounted to the bar, moving the lights around inside. Raymond twisted to adjust his holster to hang just past the break in his duster jacket.

“Ah, an old timer,” the bartender said, appearing from nowhere with a pencil-thin mustache. He dried a short glass with a white rag then sat it down suddenly filled with something thick and bubbling, red black. “What’ll be?” He scooted the concoction to the woman.

“Whiskey, double,” Raymond said, curling his nose at the whiff of creosote. “That’s it.”

The bartender nodded sagely and sat down another glass, repeating the same sleight of hand trick. Raymond inspected the liquid inside, brown and clear. It smelled strong enough to knock the paint off a barn. He downed it in one go.

“So, if I may,” the woman said, swirling a long nail in her own drink before bringing it to her lips. “What led you to us? You’ve come for a deal?”

“Aye, yes ma’am. I heard the crossroads’ll take a man’s soul in exchange for a boon.” He tapped the empty glass and scooted it forward.

“That we will,” she said leaning in close, smelling like flowers he couldn’t name with something less pleasant underneath it like the damp dark places snakes took a preference to. “What are you after?”

“Wife and boy got killed last spring by bandits, thought I could go on without them but I can’t.”

“And you’d like vengeance brought down on these men?” she asked, pulling out a small black book and flipping through it, licking her finger at each page.

“Already got that,” he said, downing the second drink and tapping it again.”Gutted the last of em last week. Thought it would help. It did a little, not enough.”

“I see, so you’re wanting your family returned to you, then? What were their names?”

Raymond swallowed and winced, not just from the whiskey. “Claire and Tommy, Thomas, surname’s McKay.”

“Oh dear,” the woman said as the page sizzled at her touch. “I’m afraid they both were a little too good. They ended up there.” She pointed up with a distasteful frown. “A bit out of our reach to return them to you.”

“Thought as much, not a sin between them I ever saw.”

“You’ll just have to wait and join them, then. Not much I can do for you.”

Raymond chuckled. “Tell me, lady. Look in your book there and see where I’m headed. If I helped foster kittens and went to church every day for the rest of my god-forsaken life, would it be enough to counter what I’d already done?”

She sighed and looked through the book, raising her eyes with amusement at several parts. “Well, not to bat for the other team,” she said, “but even given your colorful past, I’ve heard the other side can be very… forgiving if you just admit you regret your transgressions.”

“That’s the kicker,” Raymond said. “I don’t regret near any of it. I don’t think I will either, nor am I too partial to a creator that’d make a world like this besides. That’s why I came to sell my soul. I ain’t got no use for the damn thing.”

“Well, then I’m afraid your free consultation is over, Mr. McKay,” the woman said, closing her book. “Your soul looks scrumptious enough, but I’m not leading a raid into the Golden Gates to be smited by flaming swords.”

“They all gonna feel the same?” Raymond asked, gesturing to the strange and mostly undressed crowd about the bar.

“Most assuredly, we are cowards through and through.” A sip of her drink left her lips even redder.

“Well,” Raymond said, setting an old note on the bar as he stood. “Guess I’m still looking then. Have a good one.”

The woman turned and dissolved into the crowd. Raymond’s eyes were drawn to the corner of the room, where a black pit hung, full of nowhere. It was hissing like a busted pipe.

He stepped back outside, finding himself again at the crossroads, no sign of the door he had come from. Arrow neighed lightly at the sight of him.

He loosed her rope and slapped her ass, sending her whineying as she ran for the hills, leaving him alone, so far from anywhere.

There could be no hesitation now. He’d already signed his death warrant by sending the horse off. The Devil Dog of Slow Mesa never drew slow a day in his life and he didn't now. Raymond didn’t hear the bang but watched the sun die as he fell on his back. The blackness rolled over the hills like ink till it was all there was. He lay in sightless silence.

“Have you come to my body to reclaim your lost soul, gain immortality through your deeds?” a voice both low and high pitched asked through blackness. It wasn't speaking with words somehow, but raw feeling Raymond could parse out. “No, not at all, I see. You are of a true and singular purpose, death rattle. Hold. Fester. Murder. Stigmata. Suit. Kill. Hanging. Worthless. Over. Still. Your mind intrigues, indeed.”

“Who the hell are you?” Raymond managed, spitting at the foot of the chasm older than words.

“Your soul shrieks, your heartbreak leaks, through holes poorly pinned with rage and inks. You will soon break free from little brother Belphegor. So eager are you to return to the barren world of man, felo de se, that your voice cannot but swell to this full blast of human fury to demand it, despite being hardly able to bear the horror, nor endure the lingering wails of the endless line of fallen men in your wake. You plead for that poison back in your veins, yearn to don that ashen yoke. You, pride and all, need no help from me. I doubt I could even stop you, you beautiful affront to God.”

Strong legs steadied beneath Raymond as he stood, tearing away from the tendrils of dark chill and welcoming back the bone agony of the gunshot. He pulled the slug from his skull, wedged there somehow just beneath the skin. The Devil Dog was hard to kill.

“The sacrament is done,” that two toned voice came again. “I have heard your proposal and accept it eagerly. What wet labors have you set this angelic tool of Troke upon?”

“You’ll help me get my wife and boy back?” Raymond said.

“Aye, aye, I will. For I am older than this heaven the swarming children fear. Last I stretched my wings, the firmament was but clay and man lay stagnant without breath. A fine sickness you’ve become.”

“Alright, so how do we do it?”

“I shall take you to this heaven and meet its stalwart gates,” the voice said. Raymond felt a heat in the gun’s grip and looked down to see it changing, the metal shining black and wet. “As all who faced the Devil Dog Raymond McKay in life, the Felo De-se of Slow Mesa, the angels will so with fruitless thrashing and screams behind teeth gnashing to deny their exoneration from their fragile fluids dashing against the stones before pouring down over waves crashing, to rest as but putrid foam atop dark Cocytus, mashing together as ashing shades forever on beneath Phosphorus’s lashing.”

“Sounds good enough to me,” Raymond said. “Lead on.”
