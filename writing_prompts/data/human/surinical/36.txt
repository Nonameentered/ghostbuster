"I don't like the look of that," Cuirass said. The armor casted curved reflections against the ruined pillar. They pressed a boot against a patch of moss, picking bits of goblin out.

Palax held up a glass orb to the light, rubbed some the blood splatter off with his sleeve then looked closer. "Definitely magical. What was a goblin doing with this?"

"They fought poorly, even more than usual," the name guarding ranger offered as he unstrung his blade bow. "A few were already wounded when we came up on them. Bet they took that trinket off whoever this belonged to." He kicked over one of the looting bags. A dismembered foot covered in crisscrossing elven henna rolled out. 

"I don't trust it," Cuirass repeated. The sentient suit of armor ran a gauntlet finger along the downed goblin shaman's wooden totem. The pattern at the filigree trim of their armor melted to liquid before reforming, copying the occult shape of painted faces. "Don't trust any magic artifacts."

"Cuirass! You literally ARE a magic artifact," Palax said. "Just one that's afraid to give a face reveal. I'm going to try and activate it."

"I'm a mimic," Cuirass snapped back. "A creature as alive as you, magic or no. And your point is doubly irrelevant because if we come upon another of my kind, I'm going to recommend caution as well. Our true faces are nothing to ask to see, either."

"I'm with the abomination, odd as it is," Chamber-John said as he knelt in prayer over the gnawed on foot. "Mother of Honey, Glass and Whim, may this soul never dim. Onward to your outstretched hand, your mercy beyond august grand."

"I say we rip that shit up," Gorge strained, shoving the corpse of a goblin onto his spear fire spit style and trussing up the legs. "All horse, no reins!"

"Assuming that means yes," Palax said. "That leaves the Ranger for the tiebreaker." 

The group all looked at him, including the headless Cuirass. It was no doubt a bit unsettling with eyes just above where nipples would be if they were a human.

The ranger continued packing his pipe, nodding once. "Activate it. We've got no job, might lead to gold. I'd like a roof over my head and a hot meal in my belly sometime this week."

"Imbeciles," Cuirass said. "When it corrupts you all and I have to eat your shambling zombies, don't say I didn't tell you so."

Chamber-John took a step away from Cuirass. 

"Alright, votes in. I'm activating it now." Palax rolled up his sleeve and concentrated a soaking hand on the glowing orb. A pulsing beam of light worked a trailing circle inside. The group waited.

Cuirass chuckled, feeling nothing more than a warm sensation. "Happy now?"

"Did it not work?" Gorge asked, throwing the goblin cabob on their own fire.

"No, it worked," Palax wrinkled his nose. "I just have absolutely no clue what it did."

"Huh," Gorge said. "Oh, I know," he said, hopping and pointing down the grown-over steps of the ancient pyramid, now just a lumpy hill. "It summons more goblins!"

A rolling roar composed of hundred high pitched notes filled the trees as green bodies fell like chubby rain. A thrown axe split Palax's head in half.

Gorge swung his spear, slowed by the goblin already pierced on it. A group of at least six took him to his knees and began chopping.

Cuirass drew out tentacles from either mouth and beat back five, then five more goblins. The third set jumped on them from behind, chopping at the core. The stolen heresy of their symbols only served to upset the monsters further into frenzy.

He fell back in time to see the cleric and the ranger meeting a similar fate. The blackness came at the end of a goblin hammer directly to the chest.

Cuirass jerked up, rubbing their gloves over themselves. There was no injury, there were no goblins, living anyway. Palax was alive and well, holding the orb.

"Did it not work?" Gorge asked, throwing the goblin cabob again on the fire.

"No, it worked," Palax wrinkled his nose, again. "I just have absolutely no clue what it did."

"Huh," Gorge said. "Oh, I know,"

"Wait!" Cuirass had time to yell, just before the goblins fell again. "It's a save point!"
