Part 9:

The son in the black robes spun his odd weapon in circles, producing a sound like birdsong. He stared down Michael, fearless. “If your world is such a paradise, why invade us? Why take what little we have?”
  

  
I don’t even want to be here, buddy, Michael would have said. Grunts came instead. The man pulled another arrow.
  

  
Michael charged as the man darted left and swung, ripping a wide cut into Michael’s side. 
  

  
He pulled the arrow back again, baiting another blind charge. Michael weaved left, cutting him off then cut right, dodging the loosed arrow and swiping out himself, claws barely scratching the man’s chest.
  

  
He drew another arrow then held it slack, looking towards the others. “Father!” 
  

  
“Son,” the giant screamed, slurring and gripping the platform to balance himself. Bart was working furiously, still chopping at his head. “Take the Ollidan, flee this place. You must’n let them-” The giant collapsed with a roaring boom, landing on what remained of his own men.
  

  
“You feel that!?” Bart screamed, still chopping down into the puddle of blood as they fell. Michael saw he had stepped into the fissure he was making, wedged in like a horrible tick, standing on the giant’s brain.
  

  
The robed son aimed an arrow at Bart. Michael charged and swiped. The man dodged, making his shot go wide. He slid under Michael somehow and grabbed the statue, hauling it in a fireman’s carry. He retreated through the hallway sending an arrow flying back to sink into Michael. It sank into the armor only.
  

  
“We got them all down here,” Bart said, almost unrecognizable soaked head to toe in gore. “Come on, one left.”
  

  
“Doug’s hurt bad,” Dad yelled. “I’ll try and save him! Here!” He tucked something into Michael’s armor as he slowly removed the arrow from the coughing Douglas with glowing hands. “Go, they’ll need you. Get us home, Mikey.”
  

  
Michael ran through the wide hallway, leading to another set of stairs. Bart was almost at the top but Pete the Elder lagged behind. Michael stopped and knelt letting the man crawl up. He was wounded too, clutching his leg.
  

  
The stairs opened up to a circular platform at the top of the castle. A shining white bird, looking like a massive dove with a bill too flat, perched next to the black-robed son at the far end. It was as tall as the giant had been, taller maybe. It was strung with a saddle of golden lace. Michael had never seen something so beautiful.
  

  
“I’ll kill them,” Bart said, walking forward. “Slow.”
  

  
“I love my brothers, but I will not forsake the lives of thousands for their sake. They would do the same in my place.” The man mounted the bird, still holding the statue. Gusts of wind struck as the mighty avian whipped its wings.
  
“What are you waiting for, boy?” Bart yelled. “Burn it!”
  

  
Pete stepped down from Michael’s back. He grabbed under Michael’s armor, pulling out the broken flute. He blew into it. It was nowhere near as pleasing to the ear as when Douglas played but it seemed to have a little bit of magic left.
  

  
The dove swayed back and forth, slow to lift off. Bart threw his ax overhand to send it spinning through the air. It caught the son in the chest. Startled awake, the bird flew away in a sudden blast, circling around the castle.
  

  
Michael followed Bart towards the son, who was coughing up blood and wheezing, still clutching the statue.
  

  
Bart pulled the ax free. “I already killed your brothers,” he said in a whisper down to the man. “Thought you should know.” The ax swung down one last time, silencing the wail in response and sending the statue rolling.
  

  
“We did it, boys,” Bart smiled wide. “We are a fearsome clan indeed.”
  

  
Michael closed his eyes, feeling like compressing springs. He crawled from the now comically oversized armor and donned the cloak he had tucked under it. “How can you be so happy? You were so needlessly cruel,” he said, staring his disgust at Bart.
  

  
“A man has two choices, become cruel or become a man people are cruel to,” Bart answered. “You never had to make that choice, Michael. Someone else was there to stand in your place and make it for you. You don't know the way of things. Petey here does. Isn’t that right, boy?”
  

  
Pete stood facing away from them, clutching the bloody statue as he looked over the vast forest surrounding them. Campfires of several distant villages left their trails along the sky. 
  

  
“Boy,” Bart said sternfully. “Give it to me.”
  

  
“He said daughter,” Pete the Elder answered, sounding nothing like himself. “He said you took his daughter, not his son.”
  

  
“What's it matter what the whelp was?”
  

  
“Means you lied. A daughter wouldn’t have been killing no girl.”
