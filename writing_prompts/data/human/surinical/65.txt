“Fine!” Julie said, tossing her napkin down over the nachos.

She stomped across the outdoor patio, servers and other customers melting away from her glare. She reached the young man, dressed as always in full concert attire, gripped his instrument, and silenced the violin with a keyless twang.

“So, what is it?” She barked. “Why have you been following me? You want my attention? You want to go on a date, what? It's been a year, dude, still have nothing to say?”

The man grasped his violin back and reached a shaking hand into his pocket, pulling out a card and handing it to her. She snatched it and read it.

\-Be ready at 8 p.m.-

“Ready for what?” she asked, looking up and turning to see her strange serenader was gone. Several sets of eyes stared at her from the restaurant. “Well, I don’t have anything better to do.”

\*\*\*

“How long will you be gone?” Daria asked from the kitchen. Julia was glad she was going to miss the olfactory assault of her roommate’s attempt at cooking for once.

“No clue, real mystery stuff. Thilling, eh?” Julia twisted her head to look at the earrings in the mirror and took them out.

“As long as it's not ‘chop you up in little bits’ thrilling, yeah.”

“Well,” Julia said. “If he does murder me, then I don’t have to study for the chem final, so…”

A honk came from the parking lot of the apartment complex. Julia looked at her phone, 8:02.

“Shit, I gotta go. Wish me luck!” A cacophony of pots and pans sounded as she closed the door. There may have been a ‘good luck’ from Daria, hard to tell.

The car stood out amidst the 15 year old second hand rides that filled out the college housing lot. It was sleek white with windows that wrapped all the way up the roof. The door opened.

She slowly approached, adjusting her shoes to avoid tripping on the cracks in the sidewalk. She could smell a bonfire somewhere nearby past the crickets chirping at the treeline.

She leaned down to look. There was no driver. The interior was plush leather and glimmering white metal. “In for a penny, I guess.” She sat. The door closed behind her.

With no engine noise at all, the car pulled out of the parking lot and began driving. The windows dimmed until she could just make out the blur of headlights around her.

“Hello, Julia,” a voice came from the center console. “I’m so glad you came.”

“You’re not my violin boy,” she said, looking at the handsome dark-haired young man on the screen.

“Just a hired man, a gesture, though in retrospect, one not as romantic as I intended. I apologize.”

“Okay, so where am I going? I’m guessing this concept isn’t going to pull into an Applebee's.”

“No, It’s not,” he said, looking as if he wished it was. She giggled, imagining this guy longing for a cheap margarita. “You were almost out of time, if you didn't answer soon... Things are worse than they tell on the news, Julia. A lot worse. ”

“Well, it’s already pretty bad, all the war, famine, ecological disaster.” She relaxed her shoulders into the seat. “What’s your point.”

“Those things aren’t going to be an issue in 20 years. They’re an issue today, this week. Would you like a list of expected events?”

“Sure, can’t think of a better first date conversation with a man behind a screen.” She felt the car accelerate. She looked on the dash but saw no speedometer.

“The volcano under Yellowstone will erupt within the next three days. This will wipe out most of North America. The best intel suggests Russia and China have a secret alliance, planning to launch EMP blast nuclear missiles to deactivate American response and invade after this occurs. The U.S. has, unknown to them, most of its nuclear arsenal orbiting in satellites. These will launch in response, killing most-”

“Whoa, whoa, hold on. Assuming I believe any of that, What does it have to do with you? With me?”

“My father, who you most certainly would know if I said his name,” the man said, sounding dead serious, “is one of the richest men on the planet. Off the books, he has amassed resources far beyond even this, eclipsing most countries. With legions of scientists and engineers jacked up on a propriety cocktail of yet-to-be-released stimulants working 24 hours a day, he’s created a functional Martian Base, capable of supporting three thousand humans indefinitely. As his son, one of many, he’s allowed to bring one guest with me. I chose you.”

“Again,” Julia said, “assuming I believe any of this, why me?”

“You’re beautiful, you’re kind, you helped me with that Biology project. I was a sheltered kid, didn’t have a lot of positive interactions out in the world.”

“Holy shit,” she said, listening close to the voice. “You’re Lenny, the kid in our group for the Biology project last year?”

“Leonius, but yeah, I prefer Lenny.”

She opened her eyes wide, hand to her chest. “And you want me to go to Mars with you to dodge the end of the world?” She checked her phone, no service.

“Short and sweet of it, yeah.”

“And you didn’t think to, I don’t know, ask me first?” Glancing to her side, dread swelled as she saw there were no door handles, only smooth metal.

“Well, there wasn’t really a lot of time and-”

“No, even if this isn’t a weird game and you’re telling the truth, no. Take me back.” She threw up her hands. 

“Wow, this is awkward, but it’s a little too late for that.”

“What do you mean?” she asked as the windows faded to clear again, showing a dotted array of stars. She turned, looking behind her. The blue orb of Earth sat framed in the rear view window. A large cloud of smoke swirled in the clouds.

“Fuck,” Julia said.
