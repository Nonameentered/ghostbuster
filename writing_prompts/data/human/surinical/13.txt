Part 3

"Where are we? Why are you helping us?" Tina asked, picking at the bark of one of the trees. The chunk evaporated into smoke. "Where did you get a coconut?"

"Hmm," Agent Paradise said as she raked another bite from the shell. She counted off on her fingers. "A convenient convergence, to continue order, and Colorado."

"I don't think they have coconuts in Colorado," Gabe said, busy twisting his head towards the infinite horizon. 

"You would be amazed at what they have in Colorado, delights beyond your wildest imaginings." Agent Paradise tossed the coconut up to fall as smoke as well. "Be careful what you daydream, young man. You could collapse this whole place in on us with the wrong nudge."

"Really?" Gabe asked, looking back at her.

"I'm not sure, actually, but probably. The list of what your kind can't do is remarkably small."

"My kind?" Gabe asked.

"A stray scion of the Celestial Sabaoth, the mathematical minders of the Quantum Horn of Eternity," The woman said, dabbing her mouth with her tie. She took something out of her pocket and began carving into one of the trees. "Been a while since I read the prop sheet, but suffice it to say, you're a heavy hitter."

"So, I'm adopted?"

"I wouldn't think so. Your human shell is probably a product of your parents." She tapped his head. "It's the bits up here that are really special. I suggest you never get a brain scan. You might give the technician a heart attack. Real eldritch mess, no doubt "

"I'm just a kid," Gabe said. "What am I supposed to do with all that?"

"Let me help you home. As long as you remain on Earth, Mr. Stabby Hat and chumps like him will be after you. Your kind are born into this world, but never stay for long." She stepped back, a crude door engraved into the door. She took out a glass bottle and smeared a line of black paint across the top. 

"I'm not leaving my family, my friends. Teach me to fight them instead, like you did with the potassium."

"Okay," Agent Paradise said with a shrug. She opened the door, revealing what looked like a highway rest stop beyond the threshold.

"Wait, really?" Gabe asked.

"You're three levels above something I'd be afraid to argue with. You want to stay? You're gonna stay." She bent over slightly to go through the doorway.

"Where are we now?" Tina asked, pulling Gabe to follow them before he made anything explode again. 

She was careful to avoid touching the black paint smeared above the door. She could also see a face in it, the curling smile of a laughing child. Unsettling.

The rest stop sat on the side of the road. They were in a tunnel, one so tall you almost couldn't see the top, the lights up there like small moons or large stars.

"The largest construction project in history. They haven't named it yet," Agent Paradise said. "I recommended Tunnel of No Consequence but that sadly got struck down. Comedy is dead. Once we run out of this," she shook the bottle of black liquid. "We're going to need a more conventional way to get around."

"This is conventional?" Tina asked, following the woman towards the manicured lawn. 

"For the TLO, this is buttondown vanilla, hardly any laws of physics broken at all." A man in a suit similar to hers, if a little neater, stood by the entrance. 

"Gliding west but yet so still, an eye might judge me lean," the man said, cracking his neck.

"A whisper thin whippoorwill, the living needle in between, or something like that," the woman offered before busting out in laughter, poking the man in the ribs.

The man's stalwart face broke and he joined her. "Good to see your spirits up, Paradise. What you got for us today?" He gave her a one armed hug.

"Mathematical demigod and his plus one, my dear Sader," she said, popping up her eyebrows twice. Gabe blushed for some reason. "We probably need the Swathe for an hour or so."

"Calibration?"

She licked her lips as she bobbed her head back and forth. "Library, crone threeish, liminal five, no six, Alexandria."

"Roger that," he said. He opened the door and held it as he looked Gabe and Tina up and down. "Just bang on the door twice if it gets squirrely in there."

Tina followed Paradise into a large round room, mid-century modern top to orange carpeted bottom.

The walls twisted and spun, sections locking into place as furniture toppled in the controlled chaos. After a few moments, the room had changed into a sandstone library filled with books, thousands at least along the many stacks. 

"Read all these," Paradise said, popping a date in her mouth from a hanging basket. "Then we can go over some basic self defense stuff."

"Read all these books?" Gabe asked.

Tina picked one up. Introduction to Quantum Mechanics: Schr√∂dinger Equation and Path Integral. The spine cracked when she opened it. She recognized about every tenth word.

"You said you wanted to learn how to fight." She gestured to the rows. "In these words are your weapons. Learn to wield them."

"I can hardly read one of these," Gabe said, flipping through one before sitting it down.

"You really don't realize how powerful you are, do you?" Paradise said with a patient smile. "What are the chances if you picked a random book that you would read that one first?"

"Like 1 in 2745," he said. "Assuming those shelves back there are full too."

"The Forest of One Tree," Paradise said. "Be the tree, kid. You get me?"

"You mean I could just-" Gabe started. What came after was a deafening discordant litany of thousands of Gabes speaking at once.

"Oh sorry," several hundred of them said in near unison, spread throughout the vast library. 

"Have each of you read one book and then collapse the forest back," Paradise said. "Come on," she added, grabbing Tina's arm. "Let me show you the cafeteria while he works. Real preem selection this time of the year."
