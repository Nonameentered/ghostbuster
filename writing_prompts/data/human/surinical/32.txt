"There's motion at your front door."

Kyle looked up from his phone to the voice assistant. "Computer, show me front door."

A face filled the 5 inch lcd display. The man looked angry in his yellow vest. 

"No way!" Kyle said, taking the stairs two at a time. Cupid bounced beside him, feline tail swaying with shared excitement. He opened the front door to reveal the man and the advertisement laden cardboard box.

"Your package," the man grimaced. His glare was bloodshot and Kyle could hear his teeth grinding.

"The one I just ordered like a minute ago?" Kyle hesitated then took the box, pressed the side in as he had done a hundred times so he could get a finger under the packing tape and rip across the top. "Yep, 400 count googly eyes! How is this possible?"

"Googly eyes," the man said, grinding a foot into the mat. "You chose same day delivery at 11:59 for googly eyes. Might I inquire, sir, what the emergency was that you hoped to resolve with googly eyes?"

"I just want to look cool and it's crazy you get 400 of them for like $11. I was going to put them on like a thermos, I guess and I'm taking that to work tomorrow soâ€¦"

"Right, right," the man said, spitting to the side. A tooth bounced into Kyle's garden. "You want to know how it's possible? Imagine you need a job and you find out the shipment center for the biggest company in the world is hiring right next door."

"I clearly upset you. I'm sorry. I think I'm going to just go to bed." Kyle said, creaking the door closed on the man. "Thanks again."

"There's motion at your front door," The voice Assistant he kept in the living room declared. "Now announcing from doorbell."

"You see, the thing is you asked me how it's possible," the man's voice carried through the room. The screen down here was the 8-inch model, showing even more details of the man's clogged pores. "And I feel like I would be rude if I didn't give you an answer. So I'm going to tell you how it's possible and you're going to listen."

Kyle pulled this phone out of his pocket. It was frozen.

"Now imagine that you took that job and it paid $15 an hour. And then you do such a good job that they promote you to floor manager and you make $17 an hour. Forget that every day after work your muscles ache like an old man, you're making more money than all your friends."

"Please sir, can you just leave?"

"But the metrics are falling, it's harder and harder to keep up every day and the corporate blue vests circle your workstation like vultures looking for an excuse to take your livelihood. One day you hold an outgoing delivery, a book of ashen leather bound with thread that looks like maiden hair. In it, you find an incantation to make any wish come true."

The man coughed, a horrible rattling that sounded like something was desperately wrong inside of him. "I'll call you a doctor, sir, please."

"The compulsion would just pull me from the ambulance, be a waste of time. Now, say you wished on that book. For money? Happiness? Nothing so simple because you think it's a joke. So you wish upon the book that you would always hit your metrics, but the old adage is as true as they say, turns out."

"So that's what happened to you? You wished to always meet your goals at work and now you do?" Kyle unplugged the back of the assistant. The screen did not go off.

"No matter how late, no matter how long the hours, my body labors. All across these United States like an non-unionized Santa Claus. I would have died years ago, save for the magic holding me together. As long as there are people like you willing to ask the impossible, I labor. I make it work, down the list, from A to motherfucking Z."

"I'm sorry, I won't do it again."

"And as you step back, 10 million more will step forward in your place." The man coughed again and collapsed. 

Kyle rushed to the door, dropping the cheap plastic package to scatter its 400 eyes. The man was twitching on the stoop. Kyle patted the man's pockets looking for a cell phone. They were empty.

With shuddering zombie-like movements the man rose. "Break's over. Another delivery has no chance of making it on time. Without me, the metrics will fall and the corporate prophets will be displeased."

The man turned and jogged off, rounding the corner down the road leaving bloody footprints on the sidewalk. Behind Kyle, he could hear a googly eye rolling as the cat batted it back and forth across the living room. It sounded cheap.
