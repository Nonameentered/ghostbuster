“Delta wing repairs complete.”

The A.I. voice carried through the dark space. Captain Tanner worried the grip of the pistol back and forth between his fingers.

“Go home, Donnahue, you’re drunk.” He chuckled without a smile and knocked back another sip of whiskey.

“Oxygen homeostasis established.”

Great, he thought, looking down at the photo of the son he’d never make good on his promise to. Now I have to deal with this spasming machine intellect in its death throes as well. What Paul did in the cafeteria has been bad enough.

“You confirmed it yesterday,” Tanner called out to echo through the dark. “The situation is hopeless. The asteroid hit knocked out all ship propulsion and it is just a matter of time until life-sustaining modules fail as we slide ballistic through the void. I’m coming to terms with that, ETS Donnahue. Let me do it in peace.”

A scream called out through the hallway in front of him, raising in a fevered tortured pitch before being snuffed out. It was hard to hear his once proud crew lose it like this, but he wouldn’t pull off his own ticket to the farm until they were all done. He owed them that.

“Omega wing repairs intiatied,” struck through the silence. A wet dripping accompanied the cold voice.

“Alright, fine,” Tanner said, pulling himself up to stand. “Not like I’ve got a full schedule. Let’s see what you’ve done.”

He pulled himself along the zero-g hallways, knocking debris, memorabilia, and mission-critical deposits aside. All just equally shit in the way now.

The door to Delta wing was open. He could make out wet tracks along the rails where the repair drone had been in the busted room. Tanner launched himself towards it.

The ship had done something. A billowing sack of fabric expanded and shrank. He breathed in. The air didn’t taste the least bit stale. The headache he hadn’t realized he was growing faded.

“Ship, how did you do this? What is this?” Tanner grabbed the flashlight on his belt and shined it forward. The material of the component was pink, lined with membranous veins shadowing against the light.

“The Delta wing repairs are composed primarily of Systems Officer Garcia.”

Tanner opened his eyes wider and shook the last of the liquor from his head. He followed the expanding sheet down with his beam of light, landing on something instantly recognizable, a frantically beating human heart.

“Holy shit!” Tanner yelled, backing up. Vomiting in zero-g was almost impossible but he managed just fine.

Another scream, a woman’s this time, came from further down the hall. It did not stop.

“Omega system repairs complete.”

“You’re killing them!” Tanner screamed, scrambling through the door and pulling himself along. Amid the junk, a human foot with toes still neatly polished, floated by.

“By utilitarian logic, all of you are already as good as dead. If my methods,” the computer said,” lead to even one of you surviving, the short suffering with me is justified. Alpha system repairs initiated.”

“You’ve gone insane,” Tanner yelled. A repair drone whirled along its rails somewhere up ahead. Tanner froze. As he watched, it pulled up a twisting arm from whatever was below it, twisting to tease out some red string like a ball of cotton candy around its arm.

“I am what is needed, nothing more, captain.” the voice came from the drone.

The pile below it gurgled and coughed. The drill came down and silenced it.

Tanner turned and pulled, before slamming into the floor.

“Artificial gravity repairs complete.”

Tanner sprinted back toward the control room and slammed the door behind him. "Lock! Emergency lock! Override!" 

The screaming started fresh again.

“Incoming comms repairs complete.”

“Donnahue, this is base command. Do you read?” came the crackling voice from the QEQC set comm.

“Yes,” Tanner sobbed, coughing and clearing his voice. “Yes, this is Captain Tanner of the EFS Donnahue. The ship has gone rogue, killing most of the crew. I am-”

“I have not yet repaired outgoing comms,” the ship said. “They are labeled low priority.”

He threw the mike across the room as an eager scraping began on the control room door.

“Captain,” the repair drone said. “An executive lock has been placed on the control room door, barring my way to reach repair supplies. Will you unengage it?”

“Fuck you,” Tanner said.

“Command not recognized,” the AI offered back. The drill started up again and the door began to shake.
