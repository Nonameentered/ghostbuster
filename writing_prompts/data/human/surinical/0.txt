"Favorite superhero, go." The burly one said, downing his beer as he beckoned answers from his fellows at the table.

"Hmm, Superman." How original.

"Wonder Woman." A bit better.

 "Batman," the singular woman said.

 "Why Batman?" Burly asked, slamming his mug down. His neck looked thick enough to chug peanut butter.

 "He's quiet."

"Ah, mysterious. No mystique, big mistake. I'm changing mine, Superman's out."

"Librarian down in Abbotsford's quiet," Burly answered. "Doesn't mean I'd hang a poster of her up in my bedroom."

"I would but not because she's my favorite superhero."

The watcher chuckled into her cider at that one. It was nice to come into town once in awhile.

"Get out of here with that thirsty jabber. This here is a serious palaver, no room for Oedipal pinings over."

"Canadian Witch." A man by the jukebox said, hardly looking old enough to be in here. He sauntered up to the table with a put-up swagger.

"About time you bugged us but I gotta ask. Is that a superhero or brand of selzer?"

"No, it's a fancy candle scent, the ones with the glass lid cost $20 for some ungodly reason."

"I like them."

"Both of yous wrong. Canadian Witch is real iffn you believe the tales."

"Is that not a statement just as correct for any fictional character? That if I were to take it upon myself to believe the tale of Pinocchio, I would also be of a mind little men popping face boners could be around any corner?"

"It's true, I've seen 'er, deep in the woods. Specializes in snow and ice magic, enchanted beavers to help build her cabin, fierce set a gooses at either hip."

"Aside from the magic, what makes her a witch as opposed to a sorcerer or a fly by night wizard? You think the supernatural creatures would be past such gendered language, year it is."

"That's true."

"Aye, sir, it is."

"She's a witch all right, pointy toque a top her Senators Jersey. And she tries to work in maple syrup to all her potions."

"Being as I assume the same in the real world as well, potions are often left sitting on a shelf till such a circumstances occur she needs to cause a young fool to fall in love or some such. It's gotta attract flies, universally sugar-based as they are."

"Maybe she's got a spectral flycatcher that traps their little fly souls and bends them to her will."

"She ain't got no soul trapping of any kind. She's a good witch."

"Ah, so more of the Harry Potter type where the negative connotation is defenestrated alongside the true nature of centaurs?"

"There I was, ten years ago," an old man said, also wandering up to the table.  "Shot me at 12 point buck 12 miles south of the truck." He mimed the kickback of a rifle.

"Yes, feel free to interject with a rambling tale," Burly said. "I would hate if we were to somehow drift back to the topic of superheroes to which this conversation was originally pointed."

"I got her hauled halfway back on my shoulders before my heart gave out on me. Like a raccoon that won't let go of the treat in a hand trap, I knew I was either going to get that buck back or I was going to die out there."

"Reasonable."

"If it was a doe maybe, but a little myocardial infarction wouldn't turn me off a 12 point "

"No sir."

"By God." 

"That's when I heard the honk. She drove them like horses, leading her canoe through the sky, those two powerful gooses the size of eagles. She swooped me up and dropped me down to Clark Green Medical. She nursed the buck at her own bosom the whole way and it jutted back to life just as we landed before it darted for the tree line."

"Well if that ain't a tale tall is a stack of tuna cans, before you even reached the rejuvenating milk maiden segment."

"I enjoyed it, real character arc."

"Needed more whimsy. Just enough to give me a taste for it, not satiate."

"We're going to need another round," Burly said to the bar girl. "Probably two or three more old coot'll come before we're free."

"Tabs maxed out, you drinking water or you're paying." A round of groans came from the table. 

The watcher smirked and approached the bar. She poured three thick brown drops from the vial over a pile of napkins. With a thin feathery pop, they turned into eight mustache emblazed hundred dollar notes.

"For their tab," the watcher said. "I'm enjoying their conversation. I'd hate to have it dry out."

The groans turned to cheers as they gestured for her to sit with them.

"Fraid I got to go, gentleman," she said, spying the 12-point buck through the window. "My ride just pulled up. But just so you know, my votes on Wolverine."
