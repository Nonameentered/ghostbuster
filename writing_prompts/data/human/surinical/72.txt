Part 8:

Bits of stone and iron rolled with each step Michael took into the dark interior. His fathers stood in formation, a wide gap left beside Bart. The grand hall was gloriously decorated with gems highlighting the details of engravings all along the walls and columns.
  

  
Two long and twisting sets of stairs led to a platform above. There stood a giant. Black threads woven with bits of bone made up the wide cloak he wore, ending in a canine skull, seated like a muzzle over his own. He held a statue, looking as small as a toy in his hand but likely as large as a stout dog.
  

  
“I will not allow it,” the hulking figure said, forced to bend over even in the wide space. He sat down the statue at the top of the stairs. It looked like the mix of a dog and a man, inlaid with jade and turquoise.
  

  
“Just give us the artifact that'll send us home,” Douglas yelled. “There doesn't have to be more violence. Let it end.”
  

  
“Do not speak as if we are friends, here to barter kindly!” the giant roared. “Tell me! Where are my sons?”
  

  
“Oldest trick there is,” Bart said. “I tell you, you run off.”
  

  
“And if I give you the artifact, you'll kill me and them,” the giant lamented, drawing a long set of hooks, marred with rust and old blood.
  

  
“Then I guess you have no choice but to come and end us, you dog bastard.” Bart smiled wickedly, grabbing Michael’s scruff and shaking it. “Or try.”
  

  
“You either mock us or are truly new to this world, fools,” the Giant said, standing at full height once he reached the bottom of the stairs. “After the damage you’ve already caused, after the price I have already with my daughter, I will see no more blood spent. The spirit within is a sacred child, easily guided. It is already tarnished. More use to foul ends will cement its nature, the nature of the land. I will end your line of fools before I see that come to pass.”
  

  
“You'll tell me where my brothers are,” another voice came from the platform. He was between the size of a man and the giant, dressed in black robes. He easily held three of the dog beasts lunging on chains. “and then I'll let you die.”
  

  
“We don't want to use it to no foul ends,” Pete the younger said. “We just want to undo what is done.”
  

  
Michael saw the glimmer in the giant’s eye, having just enough time to dodge before one of the massive hooks came down, blowing apart the floor where he had been a moment before.
  

  
Bart screamed wildly and charged, hopping over the snout of one of the dog beasts to begin a jumping chop, biting his ax into the hip of the giant.
  
The same dog beast tackled into Michael, getting its paw stuck in the armor between his chest piece. Michael bit its neck and thrashed, slamming the whining beast on its side. He heard the music begin behind him and saw Pete’s heat reflected in the polish stones.
  

  
A crowd of dog-faced guards were filing in from a large interior door, chanting some sad, wailing song. Five dull points of pain exploded in Michael at once as they threw spears attached to ropes at him.
  

  
Michael bellowed a great roar, ripping the paw off of the already sleeping beast and running towards the crowd.
  

  
“Mikey, they’re baiting you! Pull them back,” Dad’s voice came from his side. He slammed a hammer down on the twitching beast.
  

  
Michael changed direction, pulling the five rope holders forward, and revealing the row of spearmen behind them. Flame roared and coated the line as Pete the Elder stepped forward, hands out. Dad yelled something and the flames grew thicker, dark with choking smoke, and roaring with the screams of engines. 
  

  
A cry came from above. Douglas was rolling through a wide blow of the giant’s son, who was welding what looked like a sword mixed with a bow. A knife was stuck into his eye. 
  

  
Bart had worked his way up to the big giant’s back, chopping like a mad man as he gripped bits of thread. The giant was about to snag him in the hooks. The enemies between Michael and them scattered or were crushed as he charged.
  

  
Michael jumped, digging in claws to the giant’s leg. He climbed as fast as he could up the chest. A large vein pulsed beneath the skin of the neck. He chomped down on it. The giant spun and swiped, knocking Michael off onto the upper platform. He spat out the huge chunk of flesh. Blood like a red sprinkler sizzled as it coated the racing fire below. Bart was gripping the giant’s hair now, shaking a wide inhuman smile at Michael as the bucking giant swung close to his. 
  

  
“Yes!” Bart yelled, as if in ecstasy. The blue paint on his face was rubbing off, swirling with red to form clumps of brownish purple. He brought his ax down with both hands, sinking into the skull beneath. He freed the thick blade with his foot and chopped down again in the same spot. “Yes, motherfucker!”
  

  
Something whizzed past Michael, followed by a cry of pain. A long arrow pinned Douglas to the wall, through his bleeding chest and the now shattered flute.
  

  
Three howls came in unison as the beasts below woke near instantly.
