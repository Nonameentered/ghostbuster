"So, you're telling me you won't get on the ship." I stared down at the human crew member, who'd made such a bold statement.

"It's unlucky. It's numbered 13, and I won't do it." They—no this one preferred the gender 'he'— he said. I blinked, five eyes opening and closing in staggered unison.

"What does this, 'unlucky' mean? Is it against some sort of law that humans possess?" I asked, trying to understand. We were on a bit of a time crunch, but it had fast been learned in the galaxies not to rush a human. They either got panicky or angry and neither accomplished much of anything.

"Well, it's not really a law... it's just you know, bad luck."

"I do not know, bad luck," I responded, now completely confused. They— no *he*, frowned up at me as if I was the one being difficult.

"When things go wrong or don't work out, what do you call it?"

"A mistake—"

"No, I mean when you or anyone else hasn't done anything wrong, hasn't made a mistake, but things still don't work out." A loud roaring noise from behind us nearly drowned out his words. I swivelled two of my eyes to watch the surrounding area. Nothing yet. The human tapped his foot, waiting for a reply. I would have to write him up for insubordination if this continued. Problem was, I didn't have an answer.

"We don't have a word for that. It just is. Sometimes things don't work." That answer didn't seem to sate him.

"Why? Why do things go wrong? You don't have a reason why?" He flinched as another roar echoed around the landscape. The engines on our ship flashed to life. All the other crew were on board, and we really didn't have time to be discussing this.

"And your 'luck' is a reason? How does that work? Can you measure it, see it, put it in a jar and slosh it around?" A bit of my impatience leaked into my voice. "You didn't seem phased by the number of the ship when we left our home port. Why is it bothering you now?"

He shook his head at me, like you would with a youngling. Resisting the urge to pick him up and toss him inside, I clacked my beak once or twice.

"After everything that happened today? We landed here, to do a routine research mission. First, our engine failed, so we were stuck for hours. Then, we couldn't find any proper samples, and all our test tubes were broken. Then the fricken landscape started to change around us, and we couldn't figure out whether we were hallucinating, or it was the actual planet messing with us. Now, we have a nasty volcano about to erupt and whatever is making that horrifying roaring sound. With all that going on, there is no way I'm stepping onto a ship numbered thirteen."

I sighed, completely baffled. My eyes, still scanning the horizon, spotted a large shadow moving towards us. Fast. The need to understand was subsumed by the need to escape.

"If we change the number, will that work?"

"Yep, I don't see why not." He answered. Great, now to find a number that worked.

"Four?"

"No. Definitely not."

"Seventeen?"

"No."

I huffed, trying to keep whatever patience I had left.

"Nine?"

"Nope. Not going to happen."

"Thirty-nine?"

He looked more frustrated than I felt.

"You're picking all the wrong numbers. And before you ask, 666 is out of the question as well." I threw up my appendages, as I tracked the shadow's course. It was set to connect with us in ten minutes.

"Twenty-five."

"Sure." 

I was expecting the negative, so his affirmative answer took me by surprise. Raising myself up, I shouted toward the ship.

"BLARZION, CHANGE THE NUMBER TO TWENTY-FIVE!"

It took five of the allotted ten minutes for Blarzion to re-etch the number in the side of the ship. I hustled the human on before the last spark fell; the shadow had reached small mountain size, and I wasn't eager to see it any closer. As we blasted away from the planet, I took my first easy breath. The human looked a little sheepish, but grateful.

Whatever this 'luck' thing is, it definitely needs further investigation. I shall have to inform the Taelezy Federation that this is a high priority, which will impact all future dealings with the human race.

And as a start, I will enter the 'bad luck' numbers in the ship's database. But only *after* we get safely home.
