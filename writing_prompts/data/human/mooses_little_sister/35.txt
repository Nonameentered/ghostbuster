The scroll sat on the table and we stared at it like a live viper. It was the declaration of Chosen One status. Otherwise known as a death sentence. Every Chosen One in living memory had died at the hands of the Dark Lord. It was a vicious cycle, and now my family had been dragged into it.

I looked over at our Gordy, who was trying his very best not to cry. It was him the scroll named, it was him who would have to leave the house and family and apprentice to the Wizard. He was only ten years old.

Over the next few days, we did our best to comfort him, giving him advice and sweets. And after he went to bed, the rest of us gathered together and planned. We knew our boy wasn't a hero, and we needed to find a loophole. Something that would make sure he survived the experience. And something that would stop this from happening to another family ever again.

We still hadn't found the answer by the time the Wizard came calling. I had to get the boys to restrain Gordy's mother as she would have clawed the man's eyes out, which wouldn't have stopped the Wizard, nothing short of total decapitation would destroy that man. And hurting him wouldn't help Gordy survive. Though I did manage to sneak a rather old, rather mean cat into his bag as he left. It would not be a pleasant experience for him to reach in and there was no way to trace it back to us, so he couldn't in good faith punish Gordy for it.

Now the planning took on a desperate edge. We had time, after all the Wizard had to train Gordy first, and there would be numerous trials for the Chosen One to overcome before he faced the Dark Lord. That was our first challenge. To get rid of, or manage, the threats and enemies before ten-year-old Gordy ever saw them. If the Wizard sent Gordy out unprepared, and untried against the Dark Lord, public opinion of the man would shift into the negative.

So I sent the woman out, the daughters of the family to go to the markets, to talk to the servants, to listen at doors. No one suspects the woman, so she makes the best spy. I knew this for myself, in my younger days. And I sent the boys to the country, to pay off the mercenaries and make it difficult for them to be recruited.

The girls came back, with whispered tales of a shadowed figure, one that was talked about in dark corners, and never seen. The Assasin. He was the one in charge of many of the now-dead challengers of previous Chosen Ones. So I called on our quietest son, the sneakiest and the deadliest. And soon the whispers in the market changed. They talked about the Assasin in bolder tones, talked about his death.

But there was the Dark Lord to be dealt with, and nothing should be left to chance. After all, the Wizard might still decide to send Gordy and deal with the negative opinions it would generate. And I would not let our Gordy die before his life had been lived. My great-grandmother wouldn't have let it happen, and though I wasn't a witch like her, I knew as the matriarch of the family, I had a duty to uphold.

So I called everyone. Every branch of our far-reaching family and I told them if they hadn't already heard. Across the whole country, people surged out of cities and towns, sometimes decimating the population as they did so. They carried pitchforks and swords, slings and bows. The clan was going to war.

We marched to the Dark Lords' tower, close to five hundred strong. Whatever else we were, our family was prolific. Halfway there we came upon Gordy, with a sword too big for him and absolute fear in his eyes. I swept him up in my arms and we continued on, singing an old song my great-grandmother taught me about hedgehogs.

When we reached the tower, we swarmed up the sides, broke down the doors, and overwhelmed the defences. The guards never stood a chance, though our Robert did get a cut on his nose. In my opinion, it improved the boy's looks. From the top of the tower to the bottom dungeon we filled the place, and I—still carrying Gordy— and a bunch of the boys crashed into the Dark Lord's throne room.

He actually cowered on his throne, squeaking about how it was a ruse, and that he wasn't really going to fight us, and could we please let him go? I nodded along, then carefully placing Gordy on the ground, I relived the boy of his sword. It took two thrusts, I never was good with swords, but the Dark Lord was dead on the floor of his throne room when we left the tower.

Now, for the Wizard. To our surprise, we met him on the road as we walked back to our town. I don't know who was more shocked, us or him, but he had the better reflexes. He was almost out of sight by the time we caught up. I have never seen a man more afraid than at that moment, except for the time I lost my temper with a second-rate Cassanova. But we didn't kill him.

No, we took him back to the town, and we put him in front of everyone and made him tell the world, —or as good as telling the world, with how rumours spread— about the lies, the deception and the destruction. Then, quietly in the night, a few of our boys paid off the prison guards and the wizard was found in pieces the next morning. All but his head. That we took and preserved as a warning to any future powers.

And as I tucked our Gordy into bed that night and came down to his pregnant mother, I smiled.

You don't mess with my family.
