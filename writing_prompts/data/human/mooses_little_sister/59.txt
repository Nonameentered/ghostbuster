The dame was pale. But that was nothing new to me. Most spirits didn't have much colour. I raised my scythe, gesturing her over. She looked scared, but then again, I  wasn't exactly sunshine and kittens.

"You're Death?" Her voice quavered. I grinned at her. Didn't have much of a choice with my death's head.

"Sure, doll. That's me. It's my job to guide you to the afterlife. So let's dust out." I said. She blinked at me, looking unsure. I rolled non-existent eyes.

"It means 'leave' sunshine. Now you coming?"

"Do you know what happened to me?" I sighed, moving a little closer. Most of the stiffs asked this question, and most of them were pretty easy to figure out. I hadn't had a real case in years. But as I looked closer at this broad, I frowned. There were no obvious signs on her soul, signs that over the millennia I'd learned to read. My curiosity stirred.

"You remember anything?" She shook her head, looking close to tears. The last thing I needed was a crying soul.

"Well, maybe I'll look into it for ya. Let me guess, one of the other Death's sent you along my way?" I asked. From her reaction, I'd guessed right. She twitched back, hands rising to her face.

"How did you know?"

"I've got a bit of a reputation round these parts. Used to be a private dick back in the old days. Pretty good one too." She looked to be screwing herself up for something, rubbing her hands together nervously.

"Can I come with you?" It was the last question I expected. Most souls were grateful I helped them but didn't want to stick around. Eager for their afterlife, I guess. But, I still had a standard warning I had to give. After all, while she was an anomaly, she wasn't the first.

"Yeah. But we might find some answers you don't like. And there's potential that you'll find unfinished business, and want to stick around. I'll be well within my rights to drag you kicking and screaming back to your afterlife. So you still wanna come?" The dame nodded, and I laid a hand on the misty shoulder.  "All right then. Let's take a powder."

We appeared in her house, right next to her old body. She squealed slightly, but held it together, rising in my estimation. I'd seen strong men go to pieces around their own dead bodies. I knelt, staring down at the corpse. There were no signs of violence, and the only indication that she wasn't sleeping was a bit of foam at the corners of the mouth and no breathing motion.

"Huh." I moved to her nightstand, leaving her behind with her body. There was nothing here either, except...

"What's this? You a dope fiend?" I raised a bottle of pills and shook it at her. The dame looked offended, but you don't worry about hurting feelings in this line of work. She stalked over as if she was going to grab the bottle from my hand. Which of course didn't happen, as she hadn't learned to make herself corporeal yet.

"If that means drug addict, no I'm not. That's my medication. I have insomnia."

"And how many pills you supposed to have left?" I spilled them onto my palm so she could count. Her face creased in adorable confusion. She *was* rather a looker. I put a kibosh on that thought as soon as it formed. I'd gotten dizzy with a dame before and it hadn't ended well.

"I'm supposed to have ten, but there's only five here..." The room door opened and she jumped behind me.

"It's just a gum-shoe. Besides he can't see us." I whispered. Just cause he couldn't see us didn't mean he couldn't hear anything. A small man followed the detective into the room, and I could feel the woman behind me quiver.

"That's my husband. He'll be so mad he has to come home at this time." I took a second look at the body on the floor as the detective bent over it. The long sleeves at this time of year, the high collar, all of that should have clued me in earlier. Maybe I was losing my edge. Resisting the urge to sock the man in the kisser, I snarled over my shoulder.

"Did he hit you?"

"Only when he was drunk, it wasn't really his fault—" I turned sharply, regretting it as soon as I did. She had flinched at the motion. I instantly took a step back, softening my voice as much as possible.

"If someone hits you doll, it's their fault. They decided to throw the punch, they're the one with the problem. It's not your fault." Looking back at the scene, I studied the guy's mug. I didn't like his eyes, they kept shifting.

"Does he have access to your medicine?"

"Of course, this is his room too— Oh, no, it couldn't be." She said. I shook my head at her innocence.

"He already sees you as a possession he can break and hurt whenever he wants. Killing you wouldn't be too far a stretch for a hood like that." Slowly this time, I reached out and laid a hand on her shoulder. The air around us shimmered and warped. We didn't move from the bedroom, but we did move. In time. Into the past.

It was the evening before. We stood between the bed and the wall, in the tiny gap of space. The door creaked open, and the dame's husband walked into the room with a cup of cocoa. I heard the woman squeak. The man flinched, looking at the floor as if checking for a mouse. He put the cocoa on the desk, picking up the pill bottle and shaking it, much as I had earlier. Somewhere in the house, a door opened and closed. His expression as he looked around told the whole story, and I felt the woman sink against me in shock.

With a thought, I took us back to the misty field we'd met in. She stared at me, a gamut of emotion running across her face.

"Will he be caught?" Her first question.

"I don't know. They might rule it a suicide. His abuse might actually help him with that defence." If I had saliva I would have spat in disgust.

"What happens to me now?" She seemed to be taking this rather well, after her initial shock. This dame was something else. I found myself admiring her strength.

"You go on to your afterlife. And I get moving to the next poor sap that needs my help." I said, gesturing to the great wall that bounded this place. She stared out into the field, frowning. Out of respect, I gave her some time. It was a lot to process. Murder, death, these were my every day, but for this gal... it was all new. She turned back to me, her face firm.

"I want to stay." She raised a hand cutting me off before I could respond. "Not as a vengeful ghost. I want to stay with *you*. I want to help people like me. I want to solve their deaths so they can move on."

I looked down at the woman, thoughts running like wildfire through my head. It was against all the rules, it was forbidden, it was ridiculous. But, then again... I'd never been one for the rules.

"You can stay. But you've got a lot to learn. As of right now, you're my junior partner. So if I say something, I expect you to talk back. I expect you to have your own opinions. And I want you to voice 'em. But you've also got to listen to my advice. And know that I might know more than you in some situations. Got it?"

She smiled at me, the first smile I'd seen from her.

"Got it. In return, you've got to stop calling me *doll.* My name is Molly. Use it."

I held out a bony hand, gripping hers in a firm handshake.

"Deal. Nice to be working with you, Molly." A shudder went through the landscape, and another spirit appeared behind Molly. "And it looks like we got our first client."
