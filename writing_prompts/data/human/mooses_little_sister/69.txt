Aww, thank you! I don't really plan on writing a part two, but I don't mind you asking how she died. In my mind, it was a sudden illness, or perhaps a wound that went septic, and killed her before anyone could really help her, and before the thief could come back to say goodbye.  

Thank you for the wonderful prompt, it was really great to write to.
