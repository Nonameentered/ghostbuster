Footsteps from outside my cave roused me from my drowse. It was always hard to wake up from hibernation, and the warm spring sun outside sent me back inside with a nap at the forefront of my mind. And now, I was being *bothered*.
  
I opened one eye, expecting to see a particularly bold sheep, or perhaps even a tasty bear. No such luck. It was a human. A tinned human, which meant if I killed them I'd need to hurt my teeth on their removable metal exoskeleton. They raised their sword, and I snorted a few sparks at them. 
  
"Oh, save it and go. I am not in the mood today." I growled. The sword faltered, and the human stood motionless for a few seconds. Then — just as I started to drift off again—  they took off their metal hat, and spoke, in a strangely high voice. 
  
"Um," They paused as if surprised that they'd been brave enough to speak. "I kind of have a request of you, oh Mighty Dragon." They said. I cracked an eye again, taking in the scent of sweat and nerves as I drew a deep breath. The human had the brain to look nervous. 
  
"You *kind of* have a request? Either you have one or you don't. Stop wasting my time and yours." I shifted, scales rustling against the loose stones in my cave. Frowning, the human took a step back as I sat up, curling my tail over my front claws.
  
 "Now tell me what you want, and then get out while I'm still full from breakfast," I said, trying to temper my growl just a little. I didn't want to gain a reputation in this place. A reputation was a surefire way to never get any naps. 
  
"Well, oh great and masterful— "
  
"Cut the crap."
  
"I need your help with some magic." Those were the words I really hadn't wanted to hear. 
  
"I can't help you. Or haven't you heard?" I couldn't help the note of bitterness in my voice. "I'm broken. I can't use magic. I can't store mana. I can't do anything that makes dragons, *dragons*. So run along, and leave me to my nap."
  
The human didn't run along. In fact, they put their sword down and leaned against a rock. 
  
"No magic at all? Not even a small amount?" They asked. I squinted at them, deciding they were female. 
  
"No. Nothing. Thank you for bringing it up." Raising a hand, the human brushed her hair out of her face. She seemed to be thinking. The last thing I wanted was a thinking human. 
  
"Is that why," she paused. "Is that why you're... um..."
  
"Transparent? Yes. That's why. Now— "
  
"I'm not leaving, so stop telling me to!" She flared up at me, and I actually flinched. Only a little, but I'd never been yelled at *crossly* by a human. Bravely yes, but never angrily. I sighed, lowering my head to get closer to her. 
  
"Why stay? I can't help you. Remember?" I said. Again, she frowned at me, as if confused. 
  
"You're absolutely sure, that you have no magic. None." Rolling my eyes, I huffed, a shower of sparks falling into her hair. Perhaps this human had a problem with her memory. 
  
"NO MAGIC!" I gave in to my desire to roar, and the echoes nearly knocked her out of the cave. Using the smile that revealed all of my teeth, I moved even closer. "Now. Why are you staying?" 
  
Showing no trace of fear, which for most would be considered admirable and which I considered foolhardy, she stared at me. 
  
"I'm staying, because for the first time in ten years, someone can *hear me*."
  
I remained silent, knowing that when I was confused, it was best to say nothing. Fortunately, she continued. 
  
"For ten years, I've been suffering under a curse. I can speak, and say whatever I wish, but no one can hear me. Sometimes it seems like no one even sees me. All the other dragons I've been to, they ignored me." Fervently I wished that I'd ignored her. But now I was interested, and a dragon's curiosity, once roused is more fearsome than their temper. 
  
"Who cursed you?" I asked. Shuffling her feet, she looked away. It was the first time she seemed nervous. 
  
"Um, the Lord Sinar."
  
Unable to help my reaction, I reared back. Emotions ran through me like a firestorm. The great dragon himself. The Lord Sinar, the head of all dragons. And he'd cursed this woman. I couldn't help the smile that started to work its way across my face. A genuine smile this time, though it might not look much different to the woman than my threatening one. 
  
"And you want to break the curse," I said. She picked up her sword, shoulders slumping, as she walked to the front of the cave. 
  
"Yeah. But I know, he's the boss of you dragons, and you won't do it out of loyalty and— " My laughter cut her off. It rolled out of me, thunderous in the enclosed space. 
  
"Loyalty? Loyalty? Hah! I have no loyalty to that, that... *worm*." I snarled. "That cretin is the reason I was ostracized, the reason everyone turned on me, the reason I'm out here and not with others of my kind." 
  
Fully awake now, blood boiling, I rose, horns adding to the many scrape marks on the roof of the cave. Bending a leg, I encouraged her to get on my back. With her safely astride, I emerged from my cave, roaring over my shoulder. 
  
"Let's go, human. Let's go and break the bastard's curse. And on the way, you can tell me why he gave it to you."
