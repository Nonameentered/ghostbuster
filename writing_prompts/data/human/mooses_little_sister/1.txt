'Here be monsters.' I pencilled in the words, ready for the ink to cover them when I got around to it. Those three words were starting to haunt my dreams. Every time I had a space no one had explored, there they were. Here be monsters. The reason they had started to pursue me like I was the fattest bird in a cat sanctuary, was the question they always brought. 
  
Why?
  
Why did we write that? Why 'monsters'? I knew all the logical reasons, knew that it was because of the danger of the unexplored, the fact that it could easily mean death, all of it. But why monsters? Why not something else more relevant? Why not 'here be danger'? Why monsters?
  
I went to the librarians, but they didn't know. I perused their tomes of knowledge but it wasn't stored there. I talked to the adventurers, but all they cared about was discovering unexplored places. Not why we were warned of monsters. I talked to the leaders of the cartographers and they didn't know either. It was how we'd always done things. Always would.
  
I went to everyone I could think of. Bartenders, hairdressers, children, old men and women; people I stopped on the street. I think they started to believe I had taken leave of my senses. But I had to know. Why monsters? 
  
Finally one of them suggested I shove my question where the sun doesn't shine and go find out myself. I resisted telling him that was exactly what I  was trying to do and mulled over the comment. If I went *myself* to the unexplored places, perhaps I could see the reason, perhaps I could figure it out for everyone else. 
  
So I prepared myself. I trained with the adventurers, and I learned with the librarians and scholars. And when I was ready, I kissed my family goodbye and headed into the wilderness. I was heading for the nearest edge of the map, in fact, my most recent usage of the words 'here be monsters.' It would be two months before I reached it on foot, but after the Calamity, horses were a rare commodity, and no one had yet figured out how to tame oxen for riding. 
  
The months flew by, as the scenery around me changed. I had travelled away from the flat plains around our city, through a mountain range that tested all my abilities and knowledge and forded a great river. All along I had encountered signs of life, animals and creatures that were strange to me, though I had read about them in the librarian's books. None that could be considered monsters. 
  
After two months, the landscape transformed. Now, I walked through great swathes of destruction. Large sections of land where nothing grew, gigantic square holes in the ground with strange low walls surrounding them, bricks crumbling inwards. On the fourth day of the third month, in front of me, a tall building rose. Its architecture was alien to me, all hard angles and a flat roof that could never have withstood the weather in this place. Indeed, it hadn't, parts of it were crumbling, holes forming in the center. 
  
 There was something foreboding about the building, but summoning my courage, I walked inside. If monsters were anywhere, perhaps they'd be in here. Destruction and ruin were all that met my eyes and after a desultory search, I realized there would be no way for me to ascend the building. About to leave and continue my hunt for monsters, out of the corner of my eye I noticed a door. Not a door in the wall, but a door in the ground. 
  
I opened it after moving some loose debris off the top. Stairs led down into darkness, and I lit a torch preparing to go inside. As my foot touched the top step, light sprang into existence putting my small flame to shame. Not willing to relinquish it quite yet, I walked down looking for the source of the light. Nothing obvious sprang to my eyes unless it was the strange strips along the tops of the walls. They seemed bright, but with no ignition source how could they provide light?
  
The steps weren't long and they opened into a corridor that was almost as short. I moved through it, the stale smell of age filling my nostrils, making me sneeze. There was a single door at the end and it opened at the touch of my hand, whooshing away from me as if it had been pulled. But who would be doing the pulling? When I stepped into the room, I sucked in a short breath. There was someone here.
  
He stood across from me, and spoke in a garbled language. I held out my torch in front of me, as threateningly as I dared, and firmed my trembling knees. 
  
"Who are you?" I asked, and my voice did not give away my fear. There were a few strange sounds from a desk behind the man and he tilted his head to the side. And I realized with shock I was staring through him at the desk. He was entirely transparent. 
  
"Language detected. Switching. Can you understand me?" The words were strange, almost metallic. But I could understand, so I answered in the affirmative. 
  
"Are you a seeker of knowledge?" The transparent man asked. I was starting to think he was reading my mind. 
  
"Yes." 
  
"What do you wish to learn about?" He asked. Taking a deep breath, I said the one thing that had occupied my thoughts for so long. 
  
"I wish to learn about the monsters."
  
The transparent man nodded, before turning to his strange desk. There were lots of brightly coloured little bumps on it, and he ran his fingers over them as if playing an instrument. He motioned to a flat white wall and instructed me to watch. 
  
And I saw the monsters.
  
I saw every monster I could have imagined. Great giant lizards that breathed flame, and furred creatures with huge tusks thrusting out of their faces. I saw things that must have haunted oceans and creatures that would have terrorized the air. 
  
Then the images changed. Strange words floated in the air, things I didn't recognize, but worse, words I *did* recognize but used in contexts I couldn't understand. I stared at the screen and I tried to reason it out, tried for a glimpse of rationality. Then, in a flash, I did understand. And the understanding made me weep. Made me cry out, tell the transparent man to stop. He did not, saying nothing. 
  
I ran for the door, scrabbling at it, looking for a handle, something to open it with. There was nothing and it did not open. Curling into a ball on the floor, I screamed, covering my ears trying to block out the knowledge I had sought for so long. It kept coming, flowing over me, seeping into my mind, poisoning my thoughts. 
  
Finally, finally, there was peace. The sound stopped and as I looked up, the images faded. The transparent man offered me no comfort; just asked a single question. 
  
"What do you wish to learn about?" 
  
I stared at him, not able to formulate much of anything at the moment except for one question. 
  
"Was there anything good?" It wasn't really a question of learning or knowledge, but it was the one in my heart. The transparent man's expression didn't change, and he turned back to his brightly coloured bumps. Again he motioned me towards the wall, and again I looked. 
  
And I saw the good.
  
It flowed into me, smoothing the cracks, a balm for the hurts I'd just experienced. I did not try to flee this time, I watched to the end. When the end came, and the man asked his question, I answered in the negative and the door opened. Quietly, I walked back through the corridor, back up the stairs, and into the daylight. 
  
I walked away from the building, back the way I came, back towards my home. I walked back through the desolated spaces where almost nothing grew, knowing the word for them was 'pavement'. I walked past the gaping holes, knowing they'd once held buildings known as 'skyscrapers'. And as I walked out of what had once been called a city, like my own home was called a city, I pulled out my map.
  
'Here be monsters.' It was written, perhaps by chance, perhaps by fate, over the very area I stood in. Indeed, there had been monsters here. But as I turned and looked back over the city, I smiled, though tears still wet my face. 
  
Here I had seen monsters. But here I had also seen the good. And with my trusty pencil, I wrote beneath the words on the map. 
  
'Not anymore.'
  
Turning, I left the city of both monsters and good behind, to go back to my own city. My own city of good. And monsters.
