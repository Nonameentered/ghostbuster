I will be participating in Nano this year, for the first time ever, mostly because I want to see how much writing I can actually get done in a month if I push myself with a wordcount,  as well as wanting an excuse to work on a side project instead of my main. :)  

The tldr would be... (drumroll please.) A mystery story about a detective agency run by a pixie, a kelpie and a vampire, who are just trying to keep a roof over their head... but then the bodies start to drop in their city...

Basically a mashup of fantasy and mystery genres. (Which is terrifying as I've never written proper detective stories before.) But still very exciting!

I am sort of new on Reddit, only five months old, and only five months on Writing Prompts, which is the whole reason I joined Reddit, so that I could participate. Pronouns would be she/her. And I've been writing since I was seven or eight... but I took a gigantic break throughout high school and college, and only wrote assignments. Got back into fiction writing right before the pandemic, and haven't stopped since!

(And if you're curious, I'll be posting the sort of inspiration/prologue to the mystery story on my subreddit r/Mel_Rose_Writes at the beginning of November!)
