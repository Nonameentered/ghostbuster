Clap. Lights are on. As I'm about to get out of bed, another noise, like a soft echo comes from underneath. Clap. Lights are off.

This has been happening for a few weeks now, and I've let it go. After all, when I usually get up in the morning, there's enough daylight to see by. But this week, I know that I have to rise earlier, and it will be dark. Hence my experiment.

Right now, it's actually the middle of the afternoon. I bought some blackout curtains and a ball of twine and rigged a system of pulleys. My plan is to lure out whatever is under my bed, whether it's human or otherwise. I'm trying not to think about the otherwise option, as it makes me more nervous.

Clap. Lights are on..... Clap. Lights are off.

The theory is that whatever it is, doesn't like the light, and thus only moves around in the dark. Whether this is for stealth, or some other reason remains to be seen. But, I don't want to end up dead and in a statistic on a computer somewhere, so the twine and pulleys will allow me to open the curtains no matter where I am in the bedroom.

Here we go.

The darkness is absolute, and I'm having second thoughts. These blackout curtains are really effective, I wonder—Focus! Clap. Lights are on. In the split second, before the second clap comes, I scan the room. My desk is where I'll be heading when the lights go off.

Clap.

I hit the floor running, my feet practically flying over the floorboards. Two seconds. Three. A slimy touch on my ankle. Through sheer reflex, I kicked out at the same time pulling hard on the twine. The curtains slid back, bright afternoon sunlight streaming through the window. From below and behind me, I heard a shearing scream, like metal being cut with dull scissors. Five seconds and I'm perched on my desk.

Breathing hard, I turned, doing a good impression of an awkward vulture. On the floor, there is a black mark and a wet trail leading back to my bed. I am not the only one in the room breathing hard. Whatever just tried to grab me, I've injured it.

"Why..." I gasped, more out of breath than I should be. "Why, did you try to grab me?" There was silence, except for the breathing. Then, a metallic voice echoed from under the bed.

"*HURTS*."

"Well of course it fricking hurts, you tried to grab me. So, I blasted you with sunshine. Now answer the question."

"*IT'S WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO. I'M THE MONSTER UNDER THE BED*." My mind turned over, then tried its best to take a vacation. I forced it back to the task at hand, seizing on one word.

"Supposed to? So you don't want to?"

"*NO...I LIKE UNDER YOUR BED. IT'S NICE AND PEACEFUL. IF I EAT YOU... I HAVE TO LEAVE.*" Ignoring the fact that the monster had accidentally insulted my social life, I shifted from my crouch, letting my legs hang over the side of the desk.

"And you turn off the lights because the light hurts you." There was a sound like metal being run through a wood chipper. Agreement? Tapping a finger on my chin, I frowned at the shadow under the bed.

"I have a proposition. You don't turn off my lights every time I turn them on. And I won't get a giant flashlight and shine it under the bed. What do you say?" Again, silence permeated the room. Briefly, a strange silvery metallic sliver shifted from under the bed before retreating with haste and a hiss.

"*DOESN'T MATTER... LIGHT HURT TOO MUCH... DYING*." I squinted. The voice didn't sound any weaker, and I'd heard that tone before. Mostly when I was exaggerating so someone would pay attention. Brushing my hands together, I hopped off the desk.

"Don't be a dramatic monster. I've got some aloe vera in the fridge, would that help?" I asked. When the answer came it was quiet, almost sullen.

"*YES... THANK YOU*."

Walking to the kitchen, I shook my head. Yesterday my biggest problem was how to play solitaire at work and not get caught;  today, I had a monster under the bed. Life was strange, but at least it wasn't boring.
