G'tho'kl scuttled through the ship's vents. He hadn't been able to sleep all resting cycle. After all, it wasn't every day a human came to visit. The captain wasn't able to afford a resident human, but once in a while, another ship would pull up alongside for trade, or news. And some of them had humans. G'tho'kl couldn't resist clacking his claws together in excitement. If there was a human, there would be music.

Music. The very word sent shivers through his shell. He'd overheard the crew members talking about it, heard them whisper about the magic that humans possessed, their ability to rearrange sounds in complex patterns. Poor G'tho'kl had never had the chance to hear music. But today he was determined. Even if it got him caught, he was going to hear the human make the music.

His segmented legs clicked against the metal of the vents as he ran across the ship. Light flashed and faded again as he passed the outlets. Voices rose loud, then cut off suddenly as if severed with a sharp knife. The route was easy enough, especially for a stowaway of G'tho'kl's calibre. He only had to jump through an exposed area once, and with his eight legs, he had no problems gathering speed.

Finally, he reached one of the outlets in the main mess hall. Here was where the human would perform, to the largest crowd it could gather. Carefully, G'tho'kl clamped his claws around the bars of the grate, pulling it back into the vent. No one ever looked up, and he wanted an unrestricted view. Hopping on top of it, he peered down into the hall. He'd made it in time.

There, in front of the first long table, stood one of the fleshy bipeds known as humans. It was still weird to G'tho'kl that they had no exoskeletons to protect them. The human was holding a strange contraption, some sort of folded box-like thing, with black and white levers on the side. Before G'tho'kl could fully settle himself, it emitted a sound like he'd never heard before. Then another, indescribable noise. Music.

G'tho'kl lost himself in the sound, swaying in time to the infectious beat. When it was over, he joined his small clicking claws to the thunderous applause. And the unthinkable happened. The human looked up.

Their eyes widened, and they whispered something to a black box on their wrist. Before G'tho'kl could scuttle back into the vent, a steel mesh net closed around him, dropping him to the ground. Because of his chemical makeup, he bounced. A crewmember snatched up the net, holding it away from any delicate areas, as G'tho'kl was trying to grab anything he could with his long front claws. The room spun around him as the crew member slid up between the tables towards the human, dumping him unceremoniously in front of them.

The human knelt, at a safe distance from G'tho'kl's writhing. They pressed a button on their black box; then spoke slowly and clearly.

"Hey, calm down little dude. Nobody's gonna hurt you. I was just surprised to see a crab on a spaceship, that's all. Chill man." Though the words were strange, even stranger was the kindness in the human's eyes. G'tho'kl stilled, staring up at them,  clicking his claws to show he wasn't afraid.

"There you go. How about this? You do one click for yes, and two clicks for no. Unless you have a voicebox?" The human pointed at their black box. G'tho'kl clicked twice.

"Nice! You're a smart dude, I can tell." The human lowered their voice. "Are you a stowaway on the ship?"

One click for yes.

"And do you like music?"

Again G'tho'kl clicked once. Then he raised his claws into the air, trying to simulate applause for the human. The biped's face split in their terrifying expression they called a smile.

"Nice, mate. All right, here's what I'm gonna do." The human rummaged in their bag, before jumping in surprise. They pulled out another black box, frowning down at it.

"Huh. Forgot I had this one. Ok, little dude, this won't hurt, but I'm gonna put this on your shell. Then you'll be able to speak to me. I've got a proposal for you." G'tho'kl swivelled his eyestalks tracking the human's progress as they attached the black box to his shell. There was a tiny spike of pain, and he could feel the tech working in his body, giving him the ability to speak.

"So, little dude. Do you want to come with me? It will give  you a chance to hear more of my music, and get you off this ship, cause judging by the dark looks everyone's giving you, I don't think they like stowaways." The human raised the furry bits above their eyes. About to click in response, G'thro'kl instead tried to speak. The noise was still sharp-edged, he couldn't seem to get the softer sounds, but it would work.

"Yes. I come with you. We make music." Again the terrifying smile, and the human reached out, untangling the metal net. As soon as he was free, G'tho'kl scurried to the bag, ducking inside it. The human chuckled, rising and swinging the bag onto their shoulder. Picking up their instrument, they played song after wonderful song, that G'tho'kl enjoyed from the comfort of his new hiding place. When the human finally finished, and they were returning to the human's ship, he summoned the courage to ask what kind the delightful music this human played was. G'tho'kl had heard that they separated their music into kinds.

The human smiled, a slightly less horrifying expression with their mouth closed.

"What I play, little dude, " They answered. "Is the Polka."

And even though G'tho'kl didn't know what that was, he knew he'd never heard anything as beautiful as a polka.
