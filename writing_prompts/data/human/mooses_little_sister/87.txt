I was working with a bit of the assumption that children, aren't really mentally developed enough to rationally make the choice to believe in one thing or another, similar to how they tend to be tried (or at least sentenced) differently for crimes as minors unless there are extenuating circumstances.  But as a caveat, I did write this rather late at night, and my brain may not have been operating at full capacity.  Thank you for reading!
