I did a quick wikipedia search when I was writing, and for different cultures around the world, those are considered unlucky, or bad numbers.  17 was for the italians, 39 for certain parts of Afghanistan, both 4 and 9 are for the Japanese, (4 also apparently for Chinese and Korean) and 666 of course is the number of the devil.
