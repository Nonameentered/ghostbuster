Everything had been going spendidly. 

I passed the physical tests; as healthy as healthy can be. I didn't smoke, didn't drink too much, did not engage in, quote, "risky behaviors" too often. Not exceptionally fit, but no underlaying health problems either. A perfect place to start, for a template.

I passed the mental aptitude tests; not with flying colors, I'm certainly no genius. But I've got a good head on my shoulders. No real history of issues; I guess I have a few aunts and uncles with some "slight deviations", but nothing disqualifying.

I even passed the hardest test of all; the genetic test. Where they run my whole genetic code through a host of calculations, to see how malleable it is. How easy it is to edit, without risk of major mutation. A whole 93% compatibility, what a pleasant surprise! While I was not a part of it, myself, I could feel the whole lab sigh with relief; the guy running the test said the closest they got before was 69%. Nice.

Now was the last little part. The part where I sign the dotted line, sign over my genetic code to serve as the baseplate for a hundred edits, for a million clones. It was going to be *huge*, the recruiter insisted. They had investors from all over the globe, dumping *billions* into this project! I was the final puzzle piece to unlock *trillions* in profit!

I smile and nod as I ready through the extensive document before me. Most of it is boring, dry, and a bit too legalese for my reading, but I'm able to parse out the jist of the document. Most of what I do understand, I can agree with; limited term NDAs, non-compete clauses, the like. But there was one tiny little problem, a little nit-pick I would need to change.

"Say, Mr. Barney, just wanted to clear up this little section, here. It reads: "the Signee will give all legal rights, registrations, copyrights, and trademarks, etc., of all genetic coding, bodily features, and any and all other such requirements in regards to the Project therein to the Company..."

For the first time, I see the recruiter sweat a little bit. "Well, that's just a clause of protection for the Company, is all. To ensure that you don't sue us for using the templates in advertising, and the like."

"Mm. I see." My voice, which thus far was filled with tempered excitement, falls flat. "Sure sounds like y'all would be able to sue *me* for my existence."

Mr. Barney is certainly flustered. "I can assure you, sir, that the Company would never do such a thing!"

"So, legally, they could?"

Mr. Barney's silence is all the answer I need.

"Listen, Mr. Barney, you seem like a decent man. I'm not trying to make your life more difficult, here. I just want the right to be me, to *exist", you know? Plus, having a bit of royalties to sweeten the deal wouldn't hurt." I put up a hand, to prevent Mr. Barney from interrupting. "Now, again, I think of you as a decent man, and I know you can't make this call yourself, exactly. All I'm asking for is for your Legal guys to meet mine, and hash out a little exception to this clause here."

Monotone and annoyed, is the answer I receive; "The Company's offers are final, and no revisions shall be made."

"Well, that's too bad. I'll give NipponTech y'all's regards, then."

Ah, the quickness and suprise when mentioning competitors. "What?"

"Yeah, I heard NipponTech has been working with the Japanese government to start their own cloning program, something to do with a 'dismal birth rate'. I'm sure they'd be glad to have the golden unicorn of 93% compatibility. They might even send a thank-you card, given y'all done all the major legwork for them."

The pale look of sheer terror is one I will remember for years. All those tests? All considered medical, and the Company footed the bill. They get to keep access, but guess who else does: me. No NDAs or non-compete signed yet. I can give those records to whoever I what, whenever I want, any time I want to. And Mr. Barney is realizing this.

"I-I'm going to m-make some calls real quick..."

I give a smile. "I'm glad we could come to an understanding, Mr. Barney."
