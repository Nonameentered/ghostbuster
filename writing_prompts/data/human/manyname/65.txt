I feel the push of Destiny, as it does for each one here. Everyone is led to a Door; some more popular than others. Once entered, you always have access, and none other than those who have been selected may enter again. My Destiny leads me away from friends and aquatinteces, and from the more popular areas. It leads me further, and further down the hall, until there is no longer any doors; only a dead end. And yet, Destiny urges me onwards. I feel the wall, before finding the lines of an entrance; there is a secret door, with no obvious handle. I trust my instincts, and Destiny, and push.

The doorway opens with a grinding of stone, echoing through the hall. I step into the room, excitement begin to consume me. A secret door, hidden from view? Surely, a sign of great things. Perhaps my teacher will be of powerful magics? Or one of expertise in stealth? Illusions and trickery?

Empty.

The room is *empty*.

There is no desk, nor supplies. No weapons, no books. Not even a teacher, nor any soul but myself within.

I am confused, at first. I think that, maybe this *is* a teacher of stealth, or of illusions, and this is my first test. I explore the room, with only the torchlight of the hallway. I explore the dark room, squinting and straining to see. Nothing. As I approach the end of the room, I hear the grinding of stone again. The door is closing. I rush to keep the door open, or otherwise escape, but as I run, the door gets further and further away. The room becomes pitch black, nothing but darkness to keep me company.

Confusion gives way to anger? What does this mean? What Destiny is this, to die, trapped and alone? To die, in darkness, hidden away from the world? I scream for help, though I know it is worthless. Anger gives way to fear, as I collapse to the ground, doing my best to keep from sobbing. Why? Why *me*?

Then, Destiny pushes once again.

I consider rejecting the push; damned be the Gods and their Destiny! But I cannot fight the urge for long.  I have followed Destiny thus far, and I can only walk towards it. I gather my bravery, stand, then walk back towards the end of the room. 

As I walk in darkness, I quickly feel that something is off. Walking at my quick pace, I should have run face first into the stone wall by now; instead, I walk. And walk. And walk. For hours. As I walk, things do change; the air grows cooler, and I begin to smell a change of surroundings. I smell pine, and earth. Rot, but the slightly sweet rot of leaves and plants. I then begin to hear my surroundings; insects chirping, owls hooting, squeaks and breaking of underbrush beneath my feet. I blink, and am finally given light; I am in a forest, lit dimly by a full moon. In the distance, I spy a hut, with a fire lit. 

I feel the push, leading me towards the hut. As I approach, I note a figure, huddling by the fire, tending to a pot. I give a slight breath to steady my breathing. *Perhaps,* I think, *This is my teacher?*

"Excuse me," I ask, approaching to make myself known. "Are you my teacher?"

The voice that answers me is raspy and hoarse. The figure is mostly hidden by a tattered brown cloak, though long white hair protrudes, suggesting an old age. "Why are you here?"

"I...I was hoping you could tell me, ma'am."

She shakes her head. "It is not for me to say. Why are you here?"

"Because Destiny brings me, ma'am."

Again, she shakes her head. "Perhaps it brought you here. But no. *Why* are you here?"

I am confused. "I...I don't know, ma'am."

"*Yes*." Though shadowed, I can see a perturbing smile. "You do not. You only followed intuition." 

My stomach drops, and I follow. Over my head, I feel the heat of a bolt of flame, missing me. I look up, through the flames, to see a wicked smile, and hear a cackle. I roll as another bolt of flame is rolled in my direction. I scramble to my feet, but am too slow. The woman is no longer behind the fire. I spin around, but  I am only able to prevent being grabbed by the scruff of my neck, and instead am grabbed by my shirt. The old woman cackles, then holds up a dried flower. "Eat this."

I look at the flower; a bright orange and red, with a sickly sweet smell that causes my stomach to churn. I nod my head, refusing in fear.

The woman let's out a final cackling, before setting me down. "Yes, I am sure of it. You are the one we need. The Sisters, I think, will be just as pleased with you." She waddles her way to the pot, giving it a stir, then pouring out a serving. She hands it to me.

"Not a poison, or potion, I hope, ma'am?"

"No, you fool, it is a soup! Vegetable!" She thwacks my head with the spoon. "And don't call me 'ma'am', it's insulting. 'Sister' will do just fine."

I partake of the soup, which is delicious, for being nothing but simple vegetables and water. Simple, but filling. As I eat, the woman explains things to me.

"You have been selected by Destiny to join we Sisters. We are those who protect the natural laws of this world; and by that token, we are allowed to bend them. I will teach you our ways, and our Sisters will teach you theirs. Once you are ready, you will join our Coven."

I accidentally inhale some of the soup in suprise. After coughing the soup out of my lungs, I clarify; "Coven?"

"Yes, yes, as in Witches. I am the Witch of the Wilds, protecting the laws of nature. And before you ask; we are neither good nor evil. We simply *are*. We defend what we must defend, in any way we see fit."

I think, for a moment, absorbing the information. "Then...what would I protect, once I am accepted into the Coven."

She shrugs. "I don't know that. No one knows; only you. You, and Destiny." She then looks up towards the moon. "Well, I suppose I should be sending you back now. Your friends should be out soon, too. Ta-ta!"

Before I can interject, I am in the room again. Empty, as before, with the door open. I look around, confused. Was it all a dream? Probably not, the bowl of soup still sits in my lap, hot and steaming. I hear, from the hallway, the sounds of voices talking, of excitement. What would I tell them, anyway? Would they even believe me?

I only knew one thing; I must return. I must know more. Dream or not, *something* happened in this room.

Nodding to no one, I finish my soup, and head back into the hall.
