I sit here, in waiting, in hope. 

There are those that would say that I still grieve. That this is a irrational reaction to the death of a loved one. Others would say I'm insane. Or a fool.

Perhaps they are right.

But I *must* try. There is no other option. I must see my love again. I cannot fathom continuing on another moment without seeing their face, without hearing their voice. Even if it is angry screaming about what I have done. 

And I have done a great wrong. I expect, should it exist, that I will burn eternally in the pits of Hell, for what I have done. I had taken my beloved's books, their precious library, painstakingly sorted and cared for; and gotten rid of them. Some I sold, some donated, some given away. Some, burned in rage and grief. Priceless pieces, to my beloved, a final reminder to them, a final piece of them upon this Earth. Gone.

And it is with this, I hope, to see them again. To enrage their eternal spirit, or soul, or waken them from the eternal slumber, even if it be in anger. For, in jest, laying dying upon their bed, my beloved had told me that they would return from beyond the grave should I get rid of their collection. They would harass me from the spirit realm, in retaliation. It was a part of my love's charm; their ability to make light of the situation, no matter how dark. Like a torch, ever burning, in the endless night of the world.

A light that has been unfairly snuffed.

So, here I sit, in my sins; in the liminal dissonance of a library without books, in a home without love, in a world without purpose. Here, I sit, waiting; for my beloved, either in sadness and grief, or in anger and wrath.

I do not care which.

Here I sit, waiting.

In hope.
