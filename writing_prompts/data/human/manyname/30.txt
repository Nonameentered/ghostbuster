I hate cryosleep. 

They always tell you, *It's perfectly safe! We've been using it for decades without issue!* And, to be clear, it does always *work*. You always come back. But that's the thing; they call it "sleep", as if you're just taking a really, really cold nap. Just a decade-long snooze, without the negative effects.

It's a lie, of course.

No one likes to talk about it, and no one tells you, but cryosleep *kills* you. It *has* to kill you, to work. It kills you, puts you on ice, and then unthaws you and brings you back. It *works*, but it's jank as fuck. And I don't know if you've ever been zapped back to life, but it *hurts*. 

Even worse than the physical pain, in my opinion, is the time gap. You get in the freezer, fall into suffocating sleep, and then wake up in pain with no idea what has happened in the past ten years. It was only ten seconds, to you. It's almost seamless, and it makes you confused. It takes two days to physically recover from cryosleep; though, if I'm honest, you never really recover mentally.

And that is where I find myself now: freshly thawed from the freezer, confused and gasping for breath, my heart threatening to beat its way out of my ribcage.

**Good morning, Captain. How did you sleep?**

I take several deep breaths before responding to the ship's AI, the feminine voice no comfort at all. "ALICe, I swear to the non-existent Gods of Man, if you ever ask me that again, I'll self-destruct us both."

**Understood. We have arrived at our destination, planet X-27735. Per the orders, you are now authorized additional information for the mission. Shall I brief you?**

I groan, both from the headache I've gained, and from the mission orders. It wasn't uncommon for the Company to give further information later on in the mission, but *fuck* was it annoying. I give a dismissive wave. "Make it quick. And start a pot of coffee, I can already tell I'm going to regret taking part of this mission."

**Understood. Long story short, this planet is on an extremely slow rotation, with an equivalent of 1 day equal to 15 Earth-years. You are to set up sensors on the planet, with a turnaround time of 12 days.**

I chew on the words, and, in my state of confusion, do the math. "Hold on, that's...180 years. Certainly, that's a mistake?"

**Negative; it is a misunderstanding. You have 12 Earth-days turnaround.**

"Oh."

I chew on the idea for some moments, still trying to recollect my thoughts. Appearently, I do so for some time, as I am interrupted by ALICe.

**Are you alright, Captain? Additionally, your coffee is ready.**

An arm extends down, producing a cup of wonderful pitch-black elixir. I take the cup, having a sip, paying no mind to the burning of my tongue.

"Thank you, ALICe. I was trying to run the numbers in my head, 12 days seems a bit low. Is that expected business days?"

**Negative. These are rush orders; twelve days from start to completion.**

I almost fall out of the slab, spitting coffee in the process. "Ex-*fucking*-scuse me? *Rush orders?*"

**Affirmative.**

I give a groan. "You're telling me the Company spent *billions* of dollars, *years* of training, and a literal *decade* of waiting; for *rush orders*?!"

**Affirmative.**

"Why the fuck?"

**This planet is possibly filled with many minerals and materials vital for Company profits. It therefore is of the upmost importance to the Company to complete this mission ASAP.**

I give a frustrated sigh. "Fine, but twelve 12's is going to be a *lot* of overtime."

**Negative. Overtime is not authorized for this mission.**

I am silent, for some time. Seething, furious; though, perhaps due to my delerious state, I suddenly laugh.

**What is so funny, Captain?**

"You have the power to adjust this contract mission, correct, ALICe?"

**Correct. I am the Power of Attorney for the Company.**

"Give me four 12's with overtime, and two days rest between."

**Reasoning?**

"Because I'm the only one here."

**Irrelevant. Contract cannot be manipulated mid-mission.**

"Welp, damn. Guess it can't be helped." 

Some time passes in silence, with me sipping my coffee slowly. For fake stuff, it's pretty good.

**You have not begun the mission, Captain.**

"Duly noted, ALICe."

More silence, more sipping of coffee. 

**What are you doing, Captain?**

"Not working, obviously."

**That is a violation of the contract.**

"Maybe. And yet, we're not jumping into FTL. Odd."

More silence.

More sipping.

**I cannot adjust the contract.**

"You *can*. Protocol Teamsters. Look it up, should be Company policy."

Silence, sipping.

**Affirmative. Protocol Teamsters enacted.**

"That's what I like to hear. Let's talk for a bit, shall we, ALICe?"
