The girl, tied to the stake and pyre, begged for forgiveness. Forgiveness from God, from the Priests, from her friends and family. She had laid with a man out wedlock, this much was true. But she was no witch, she pleaded. She was a woman of faith; she was devout. A single mistake, for which she had asked for forgiveness. Of which, per the Holy Texts, God would forgive.

Instead of hearing her pleas, the mob gagged her, to muffle her cries. The Priests charged her of heresy; learning of maths, of reading, of *science*. Of reading the Holy Texts herself, and not entrusting the Priests to read. Of confronting and refuting the Holy Orders given by them, claiming them not in line with the Holy Texts. Summarily, the judgement of God is clear, they say; a death by burning at the stake. 

Before the pyre is lit, a quiet, hoarse voice echoes through the village. 

*"He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her."*

The crowd is silenced, and turns to look at an old woman, hobbling towards the Priests. Cane in hand, slow and wobbling. Frail, but determined. The crowd, uncertain to how to react, make way, as the Priests stand, defiant, though curious.

"You would defend the likes of a Witch?"

The old woman first reaches the Priests before continuing, but answers. "No, but I would defend the likes of the innocent."

"And what, pray tell, is your proof of innocence?"

The old woman pokes the lead Priest in the chest, asking loudly, "And what, pray tell, is your proof she is not?"

The Priests are taken aback, and shoot back, spitefully, "We have given the proof; she is of math and sciences, she is of reading, she is a whore out of wedlock!"

"No!" The woman continued, continuing to poke. "These are your *charges*, but there is no proof!" The woman interrupts the Priests, continuing to quote the Holy Texts. "'And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about'; 'When all Israel is come to appear before the Lord thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing'. These are words that *you* have read to us, through our years. The *only* charge you have is this girl committing to love out of of wedlock, yes, though I see no man staked up there! And if it is so damning to do so, you best burn this village to ground for the impotence of those here!"

**"Enough!"** The lead Priest, red in the face, spat back, having heard enough. "Lest you wish to burn with her, you old hag, you would silence your tongue! Our judgement is made, and it is final!"

The old woman seemed to back off, only asking of the crowd, "And of you all, you agree to this judgement?"

There were a few who backed down, but overall the mob concurred. They would see the Witch burn. The old woman nodded in understanding, turning to the bound woman. "I am sorry, child, for the pain you will endure." She then hobbled away from the Priests and mob, hanging to the edge of the crowd some paces away.

The Priests, newly inflamed by their success, whipped the crowd back into a frenzy, and lit the pyre. It quickly began to catch and burn, and soon began to lick at the woman's feet, embers beginning to catch on her dress. It was here where the crowd switched from zealous fury into terror; as embers caught, flames erupted on clothes of the mob. Panic ensued, calls for water; but it was too late. As the first burns began and the woman screamed in muffled pain, the mob was set with painful burning. As they spread and worsened on the woman, the burning became melting and charring. By the time blisters formed, only human-shaped charcoal remained of the angered mob, their panicked runs setting houses ablaze. 

Then, as quickly as the pyre started, it was extinguished. The old woman no longer hobbled, and made haste to the woman, tearing off her bonds and gag. Offering a wineskin, and feeding into the woman's mouth. "I am sorry, child, but I can only alleviate the pain. But if you come with me, my Sisters can heal you. If you come with me, I can further your knowledge. If you come with me, I can teach you the Old Knowledge, of magics and sciences. You will be free of control of your body, free of control of your love, free of control of your mind. You will, however, truly become that which they seek to burn; a Witch. A Sister of our Coven. Will you come with me?"

The woman, with some of her pain fading, nodded. If she would hunted and believed to be a Witch; and there were none else who would defend her innocence, then it would better to be a woman of heresy, and become implicit in her supposed crimes.

The two woman hobbled into the woods, to be never seen nor disturbed again.
