"Now, listen well, little one. I will only say this once."

The sage's voice was dark and haggard, like glass scraping against rock. The bony hands pointed to places of interest, the sunken face and hallow eyes giving little in ways of the sage's emotions.

"You will see and feel things that will scare you. Know that so long as you remain on the table, you are safe. So long as you stay within the circle, you are safe. You *cannot* leave the circle until I tell you. If you do not heed these instructions, you will **perish**."

The little girl on the table, obviously frightened, coughed for a moment while nodding. "W-will it hurt?"

"Yes," the haggard wizard wheezed, "Unlike anything you've experienced, and will never experience anything like again. But you will be safe, within the circle. You will be stronger. You will live unlike you've ever lived before."

"As to you two," the wizard spun around, pointing a deathly hand at the parents in the corner of the room. Their eyes showed a mixture of fear, desperation, and hope. "You will hear your little one scream. She will plead and beg, wracked in pain. *Under no circumstances will you enter the circle.* If you do, I can give no guarantees to any of our lives. Do you understand?"

The couple fearly nodded, wracked in nervousness.

"Good. Let us begin."

The wizard outstretched his hands over the girl, producing a dagger in one. He began to chant the eldritch words of ritual, causing the shadows to grow and the lights to dim.

*Heed my words, keepers of Magic. Conjoin life and blood, from life and blood, into that which shall receive.*

The wizard, in a trance-like state, circled the girl, approaching a goat tied to the table.

*Consume this life, so that one may receive life!*

He slit the animal's throat, it giving a gurgling bleat. Blood pooled and splashed on the white robes of the mage, staining them red. The pool drenched into sigils carved into the stone floor, magicly filling them in. The room grew darker, and a sudden wind picked up; moaning and howling like the dying of men. The wizard, unnerved, moved to a sheep, similarly tied.

*Consume this soul, that so one may bolster theirs!*

The sheep, throat slit, collapsed silently, as its portion of soul flew from the beast into the girl, who began screaming in pain. The wizard continued, moving to the head of the girl.

*Consume this blood of Man, so that one may be strengthened!*

He plunged the dagger into his abdomen, giving a slight gasp of pain. He removed the dagger, holding it waveringly over the girl's mouth until a drop fell in.

Then, silence.

The winds died immediately, the howling stopped. Only the haggard breathing of an old safe, bleeding; and the quiet breaths of of the little one asleep.

"It is done," gasped the wizard. "She will never be marred by disease again. She will remain strong until she is strong enough on her own."

The couple rushed to their child. Seeing the girl safe, unharmed, the thanked the wizard in earnest. The father offered a meager amount coin, which the wizard refused, downing a potion to heal his wounds.

"Save your coin and thanks. This is my penance. Leave now, if you would, please. I must clean up."

The couple, child in their arms, left the wizard in grateful silence. The wizard sighed when they left, grateful as well. His modifications to the spell had worked. He could use the forces of dark to serve the light.

He began to clean up the blood, a smile on his sunken face.
