Alice sat at the dinner table, calming her nerves, replaying in her head what must be said, and what must be done. She had to end this relationship with John, and it must be done tonight.

If she did not, she would have to end him.

She had begun this relationship with John, she told her superiors, to get closer and gain his trust. John was a cautious man, he wasn't going to be sloppy about security like the others. She needed to gain his trust, she had said, to really dig deep. Find out what he'd been working on, what technologies she could document. And it had worked; but lately, she caught herself making excuses. There must be more, she postured. Something he was still hiding. But the excuses were wearing thin to her superiors, and she herself had realized the truth; she was committing the greatest sin, next to treason, a spy could commit:

She was falling in love.

She didn't know why, only that it was the truth. John was average in just about every way, another scientist and engineer for a defense contractor. And yet, he found a way to nestle in her heart. He was kind, in a way unlike the others. He respected her abilities, and had a lightness of heart she couldn't fully understand. 

It was these reasons why she had to leave.

John, when he entered the home, saw his partner sitting at the table, contemplating. His smile turned into a frown, and with a sad sigh, asked: "I guess this means we need to talk?"

"Yes," she replied, motioning to the chair across from her. "We need to talk."

He complied, sitting down. His face was sad, but not as distraught as Alice would have thought. "I'm leaving you, John. This isn't going to work out."

John sat still for a moment, before biting his lips and nodding, tears doing at the edges of his eyes. "I understand." He wiped his eyes on his sleeves, and took her hand in his. "Just...before you go, will you hear me out?"

Alice thought about refusing, of making a fuss, and leaving then and there; but she could not. She could only nod sadly in approval.

"You are the light of my life. I love you, and I mean that with all my heart. I will always love you. I won't...I won't ask you to do the same for me, but just know that you have made my life so much better ever since we met. Its been worth it, every step of the way, ever day, every minute, every second." He paused for a sniffle, and to wipe away some tears. "Just know that, I love you, and I always will. And I forgive you."

Alice was caught off guard. "Forgive me?"

John nodded. "I know you've been breaking into my safe room. Copying my data and plans, I'm sure. I've known for a couple months, now. Plus, I saw the tickets, I know your folks don't live in Paris." 

Again, Alice thought of pulling away, elimate the target. He knew too much. And yet, something stopped her. "How?"

"Honey, let's be real, you are *way* out of my league." John gave an understanding chuckle. "Besides, I don't think an accountant needs to know a dozen languages, or how to kick a three-hundred pound dude's ass in 7 different ways, or put near-perfect shots at the range."

"You...were testing me?"

John shook his head. "No, everything was coincidence, I just so happened to take notice."

Tears now welled in her eyes, too. "I can't stay."

"I know."

"They'll kill us both if I do."

"I know."

Her phone rang.

"That's probably your boss, I'd guess."

"Probably, yes."

"Listening in?"

"Most likely, yes."

John sighed. "Christ, I've gotten sloppy."

"So have I."

The two exchanged tearful smiles, sitting in the ringing. John finally chuckled.

"What?"

"Well, I reckon that if your boss is this persistent, he's not going to let me live anyway. Might as well have one last candlelit meal with the love of my life." He stood up, making his way to the kitchen, turning on the gas burners without lighting the flame. He gave a devious smile to his love. "Would you mind lighting the candles, for old time's sake?"

Alice smiled back, understanding. "Yes, of course, dear."

Officially, after that night, John Doe and Alice Louise were presumed dead after an accident with a terrible gas leak caused the house to explode. 

However, privately confided by the Agency, no bodies were found.
