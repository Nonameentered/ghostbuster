James Smith was in hot water.

He couldn't fathom why. He was saving the world, just using some unconventional methods to do so. It certainly wasn't the first time such things had happened, and he most certainly wouldn't be the last.

Not that he didn't *completely* understand; he was driving like a madman, ignoring the drone of police sirens behind him. But time was of the essence! If he was to stop the dastardly plot already in motion, he needed to make haste! Plus, he didn't have his identification with him, so to them, he really *was* just a madman on the road. He had been forced to ditch them, for the sake of the mission; a sacrifice he took with dignity.

He also thought of a few other things that might be putting his heels to the fire, as it were. Yes, the car he was currently driving was not his. He had to requisition it from an innocent civilian. And yes, he *may not* have been particularly kind in the matter, and said civilian *might* have sustained some minor to moderate injury. But, again: saving the world. Top-secret mission. Can't exactly claim that to a civilian and expect them to believe you, so violence was had. However, though understandably, the civilian started the fight, and James simply finished it. Additionally, *at most* the civilian would sustain a scar or two. And chicks--and dudes, he wasn't one to judge-- *love* scars, especially one with such a cool and/or agressive story about it. So, really, in a roundabout way, helped give that civie some improvement on their game.

He pondered further, stepping back further into the mission thus far. He supposed that the copper choppers signified that they found the warehouse. He did suppose it was very suspicious, and *technically* illegal, for a lone man to run from the scene of a crime; especially one with several dozen incapacitated mobsters, hundreds of kilos of drugs, and stolen weapons galore. Really, he was on the cops' side, they just didn't know it yet. Or, perhaps, never would, seeing as this mission was above Top-Secret. *Technically*, it was an *SCI* mission, but "above Top-Secret" was a bit simpler to explain. But that was neither here nor there; *point is* that all those drugs were now off the streets, and he *could've* killed all those mobsters, but he didn't. He had a lincense to kill, sure, but it didn't mean he had to use it, even on some truly vile people. 

Ah, well, except for the one. And, he supposed, a few more *might* have died in the interim between when he *convinced* a few to give up some information. But again, these were monsters, gangster. Truly rotten poeple to the core, worse than scum. Dealing drugs, selling illegal arms, smugging of persons, pedo rings. Not that he had viable *proof* on anything but the drugs, but all gangsters were really the same. And if they weren't, it would send a message up and down the chain to people who *definitely* were.

And that one...James guessed that was the real deal problem. The line in the sand that tipped this from the protection he would normally expect. After all, it was in bad form to utilize methods of information extraction that cause pain. And draw blood. And maim. And eventually kill. But, it was *definitely* the boss of this cell of the the group, which, again, sends a message. Plus, it worked; ol' boy was singing like a canary after the sixth fingernail was torn out. He got the information he needed. He supposed he wasn't proud of tearing out the rest, and the toenails, and the eyelids; but a message still *had* to be sent! That crime pays, but only in pounds of flesh!

All of this was for the good of the world. They would see. They would see him for the hero he truly was. 

Then, he knew, HQ would reinstate his status as an agent.
