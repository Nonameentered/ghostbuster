"Well, hey there champ."

I freeze. The familiarity of the voice sends a shiver down my spine. It is warm, and welcoming. Happy, and strong. 

My father.

He gives an impressed whistle, admiring my handicraft. I know that he cannot comprehend the information being fed on my screens, nor the capability of the various weapons and inventions littered about. "Like what you've done with the place, looks like you've finally learned how to organize it." He gives a chuckle with the little joke, but I can tell there is pride in the undertones.

"Why are you here?" I question, slowly turning around. Was he here to stop me? It was too late; the world succumbed to my genius. Even if he were to try and kill me, he would only accelerate my plans.

"Well," he said, leaning carefully on the console in the center of the room. "Heard my boy finally did the unthinkable and took over the world. Thought I'd stop by and congratulate you, and maybe pass on some fatherly advice."

The words halt me. "Congratulate?"

He smiled. "Yes, this has been your goal ever since you were a youngin', to take over the world! My little boy, grown up and accomplishing his dreams!" He shook his head sadly, but smiled again. "I'll admit I'm not sure how I feel about some of the things you did to get here, but I know such a grand goal does come with a lot of challenges that I can't even imagine. And I'm sure you did your best to avoid as much bloodshed and destruction as you could, given everything."

"How are you so sure?" I stepped forward, hesitantly, but growling. "I am a different man than the little boy you knew."

The old man sighed, and stepped forward as well. "It's true you've grown up, and are no longer a little boy. But you're still *my* boy. You're my *son*." He stepped closer and closer, until he was within arms reach. He placed his hands on my shoulders, a look in his eyes. "And, despite my misgivings, I'm proud of you, son."

The sickness returned, as it always did when he was around, when he spoke like this. My eyes begin to water and my sinuses open, like the worst hayfever. My stomach feels like I've eaten something rotten, and I wish to rid of it. There is a heaviness, hard to physically describe, inside of me. This is why I sent him away, excommunicated him from my existence. Hid myself away, so that he may never find me. To avoid the sickness; but now it returns in force. I can only sob out: "I'm not even *your* son."

He is taken aback, for a moment, before pulling me in, wrapping his arms around me. The sickness increases tenfold, and I cannot hold back the sobs. "You're not my blood, no. But you *are* my son."

I sob for several minutes, until the sickness is quelled in my body. Though I know it is too late; it has already spread to my mind. "What was your 'fatherly advice'?"

Father smiled, again with that look in his eyes. "Remember your goals, your dream. The *full* dream. Maybe you were too young to remember, but it was when you were very little:"

As Father described the scene, pieces of forgotten memory flooded in. A child, I had been. Something scary on the television, a terrorist attack. Hundreds killed. Young enough to understand death, and it's permanence, bit not old enough to understand the politics behind it. I had asked my father why people would do such things. Because people can be bad, he had said, just like how they can be good. Sometimes people got so angry, and used violence to get their way. I then remember my own words.

*"I'm going to rule the world, so everybody can be good!"*

My father smiled still embracing me. "And now you're here. The whole world in the palm of your hand, clay for you to change at your whim. The sins of my generation can be washed away; ecological disaster can be adverted, global hunger thwarted, no one has to be sick and dying. You can bring us into utopia, for all our sakes."

"Yeah," I croaked, voice dry from sobbing, "That sounds great, Dad."
