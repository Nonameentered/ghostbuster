My tale begins in a time I do not remember; for I was pale, and sick, and dying. I remember falling as a child, playing with my siblings, and gashing my knee. My mother cleaned my wound as best she could, but the Gods were against me, and allowed the wound to fester. I fell to fever, to the Wound Sickness. The story comes from the accounts of my father.

It was another day, minus my sickness; even if his son lay dying, the fields must be upkept. The nobles must have their portion of grain, and we must have enough so that we too should eat. Come midday, though, my father says he felt the coming of rain, but there was no clouds in sight. Nonetheless, lightning struck; not from the sky, but from the very ground itself. With a crack of thunder, from the very center of our field, where there was wheat; there were suddenly several dozen Men, dressed in strange garbs, occompanied by tools and boxes, and large behemoths of metal, standing on scorched earth.

My father called them 'creatures', and reported the number as 'uncountable', though I know now that they are Men, like you and I. I do not blame my father, as the garbs they wear are patterns of greens, browns, and blacks; save for metal blue helmets they sometimes wear on their heads. At a distance, they blend into each other, and in the forests they are all but invisible. And with metal beasts belching black smoke into the air, anyone within their right minds would view these Men as creatures beyond our understanding.

It was these reasons why my father did not fight these Men. Were they creatures of the Gods? Come to save his son, answer his prayers? Devils, looking to make a deal? In the moment, my father cared not, and knew that we poor peasants were no match for such creatures. I suspect, though he has never said as much, that he was desperate, too. Be they Devils, I think, he might have struck a deal for my life.

But as I have said; these were no Angels, nor Devils, only Men. Men, with incredible tools and knowledge. It is after this time that I can account for myself, though a bit bleary as fever was still in hold of my mind.

These Men, after several days of setting themselves up a strange hut outside our own, colored in the same way as their garbs, learned to speak with us. Through the days, they would have my mother and father speak into one of their metal boxes; until one day, speaking through a smaller metal box, the Men greeted us in our own language! It was crude, and broken, but to be understood was a Godsend. The Men, especially a woman of wonderous beauty and supreme intellect, asked many questions to my family. Questions about our lives, our farm. Questions about our village, of our nobles. About our Gods, and the stories we tell. To this day, Men like her find great joy in discovering things about us, and sharing the stories of their world, the knowledge they hold.

Ah, but I ramble now. You asked of the Alchemist. The one who truly saved my life.

Of course, at the time, I was afraid. Strangers, Men they may be, surrounding my bedside, speaking in tongues I did not understand. Touching me, analyzing me, poking me with needles, taking of my blood. Connecting me to strange devices, that made unheard of noises, of suspended liquids that drained into me. Looking back, my father told me it was alright, that they said they would heal me, but the squeeze of his hand on my shoulder; that is what makes me believe that my father thought of them as Devils.

After some hours, one of these Men told my father that the metal box told them what was wrong, and how to heal me. He was a man of unusual color, like several of the Strangers; his skin was a near midnight-black, his hair shaved close to his head curled nonetheless, his smile white as clouds, with a slight gap between his two front teeth. The first part would burn, and sting, he said. The second would be painless, like the suspended liquids. The third would lull me into sleep. And of all the things people say of the Strangers, I tell you this: the Alchemist does not lie. 

The first stage was a cleansing of the wound, like my mother had done; but they used rags as white as snow, from sealed containers they tore apart, and used vile liquids that, yes, burned and stung like nothing I've felt before. Then again, I was a child; from Men like us who have received much worse injuries, they say it is actually very mild. 

The second stage used another needle, connected to a tube of some thick liquid. They stuck the needle into, not I, as I suspected, but into the clear line connected into my arm. 

The third, as promised, a clear liquid; drifting me into a deep slumber.

From the accounts of my father, my fever broke even worse, my body roaring like a fire. He, he said, had half a mind to kill as many of the 'Devil-Men' in retaliation; but he knew he would not go far, and merely wept at my bedside, begging forgiveness of the Gods. The Gods, of course, did not answer.

But the 'Devil-Men' kept their promise.

After several days, I had awoken. My fever was gone and the only sign of wrongness on my body were the marks of the needles and of my wound, all of which were healed or scabbed over healthily. 

After that day, I vowed to become an Apprentice to the Alchemist. I vowed to learn the ways of the Strangers and their healing. I am far away from being a master such as him, but even in these dozen years or so, I have made great strides. The Alchemist--my Master, my Teacher, my friend--has even said I have surpassed most of the 'Medics' he has seen, the Strangers who are Men of healing that you might have met.

So, come, curious friend. I have told you my tale of the Strangers, of the Alchemist. Let us raise a toast to them.

Glory, to the Strangers! 

Glory, to the Alchemist!

Glory, to that most strange and glorious elixer, Antibiotics!
