I took a moment to size up my opponent, and their spell. Magic, and Her users, were *always* a bit flashy--it was simply a way of the medium, with very few ways around it. But this opponent of mine *flaunted* their spells, doing everything in their power to add fashion and flair into spellcasting. Singing the incantations, practically. 

Disgusting.

My opponent flails their arms around, summoning circle after circle of magic. I would be impressed, if the circles were not overlapping in such a manic way, glowing the area with bright light of technicolor madness. Their singing of Elemental praise, a garbling of flame and stone and steam, beckoning the same.

I would call it pathetic, though I must admit that this caster's *ability* is profound, even if I disagree with their choice of spell and flair. A summoning of a minor, but destructive, planetary being: a Meteor Strike spell. Such elemental destruction takes a high degree of skill, and a large pool of mana. It would, I assume, also deplete that pool of mana. It would be professional of me to at least match his level of casting, if nothing else.

So I tread back to an old classic, my favorite combination of spells. 

Firstly, I draw my mana into a bolt, ready to leap from from its position in space into my opponent; a Mana Bolt. A simple spell, a cantrip; for even the lowliest level of wizards, the mana draw of the spell is outpaced by mana regeneration, allowing one to cast it indefinitely. By that token, it also does not do much damage, and is easily deflected.

And then I lock it into place.

Next, I cast a spell of duplication, at a slightly higher draw of power, setting it upon the bolt. A simple, though effective, Duplicate Spell.

Then I lock it.

Next, I repeat, but set the spell with more power, and copy my prior spell of duplication.

Lock.

Repeat.

Lock.

Repeat.

Lock, repeat, lock, repeat, lock, repeat, lock, repeat, lock, repeat, lock.

I hold for a moment, briefly double-checking my casting, before smiling and releasing the spell.

In an instant, what was once a single bolt immediately splits into hundreds of thousands. Three hundred sixty-two thousand, eight hundred and eighty bolts, to be precise. 

Then comes my favorite part; watching my opponent go through the five stages of grief in a second. They could easily drop their spell, to put up a shield of reflection, or they could chance the incoming bolts will mostly miss, allowing them to continue casting. This opponent is wise, at least, as they split the difference; choosing to set off the spell with a sudden modification. Rather than waste the energy, they force the planetary body to erupt from ground, sheilding them. Very well realized.

Unfortunately for them, this is part of my plan. It mattered not if they shielded themselves or not, all that matters is that they are distracted, allowing me to cast a spell of spacial distortion, allowing me to make a step behind them, drawing my blade as I do, placing it to their neck.

"Yeild."
