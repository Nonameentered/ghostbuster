The creature screeched, growling utterances of its fowl language, a cacophony of choked and shrieked air. Coming to it's call, comes a similar creature, hulking and hairy, lumbering to the feasting area. Another shrieked, and offspring emerge, cackling and feigning combat and death. A great nashing of teeth, grubby digits clawing each other.

The creatures surround the feasting area; a setting of wood for the slaughtered to be consumed. They encircle and sit upon twisted wooden thrones, and together utter the ritualistic chant; a prayer of the consumption of the flesh and blood of Man, of receiving the spoilage and rot of grains. Unholy utterances completed, the creatures begin to feast.

They feast upon beasts, slaughtered and drained of blood; slathered in poisons and irritants, and torched by smoke and flame. Not content on the consumption of life, they feasted upon flora as well; but tarnished it with essence of beasts. Tubers boiled, smashed, laden with stolen milk of beasts, beaten to only be fats. Vegetables, cooked in the essence and grease of swine, slaughtered and left to pickle. Verdant beans, monsters of their own, swimming in the scorched milks of beasts and irritants.

After their feast, the creatures begin another ritual; the creatures moving to the next area, a room of skins and furs. The creature seated itself on the throne, built of the skins, and began the ritual of forgetfulness, viewing upon a box of glass and metal, squealing in cackling laughter together of the vivid images. After some time of brain-melting, the smaller of the creatures, the offspring, find forceful sleep. The bigger two carry their young to their beddings, silent in a way yet unheard. The two set upon several rituals; of cleansing, of bathing, of waste expulsion, of fornication. Then, the area fills with the sounds of choked breathing, as the two find rest.
