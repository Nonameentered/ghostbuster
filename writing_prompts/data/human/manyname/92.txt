Thank you! Glad to see that I haven't lost the spark. Truth be told, might have to incorporate this/these characters into a book, or at a minimum my next campaign I DM.

Read through your story, and well done! I like how nonchalant Gladious to his customers, be they Hero, villain or something in-between.
