Useless, they called me. Worthless, they said. And these were of my own classmates, once my friends. Even the friendliest of them still pitied me.

They are all fools.

Certainly, I was not graced with a title like Hero, and the dozens of skills it came with. Nor was I graced with an ability like Divine Healing or Limit Break, and the fantastical prowess they came with. No, *I* received two abilities: Fission, and Fusion.

I do not blame the people of this world, nor their rulers, for their misunderstanding of my power. Fission? Fusion? These words, in a world devoid of physical sciences and full of magic, are lost on them. Truly, they are lesser fools than my prior friends, as even the viceroy knew that these powers are not given without reason, and the people know that any power is above none. 

But my friends? They are from my world, a world so ingrained in science that magic is truly a fantasy. Nonexistent. They should *know* and *understand* the implications of my powers. But they do not, they only apologize at best, and head off on their grand adventure without me. Perhaps their powers filled their egos as well.

Fine.

I'll show them my power. I will do what no adventurer has done before, and I, alone, will defeat the grand evil that plagues this world. 

It will not be all that difficult, all told. It will simply take time. Time as I prepare, and as gather the tools to make up fory weakness. Time as I hone my abilities. Time as I study, learning the ways that magic changes the science I once knew. 

It takes years, but that is no matter. It would take a decade for my prior compatriots to gather enough strength to be ready to truly face the Darkest Foe. But I, I am ready now. My armor, a glistening robe of silver threads, composed of dozens of sets of armor and enchanted garbs; lighter than silk, and stronger than adamantine. A single ring, ever changing in its color and hues, a combination of over a hundred magical artifacts. A dozen various tools and devices, each containing within themselves a dozen or more implements combined. Even my own self, my own body, is unrecognizable to myself; tokens and tidbits of monster grace my physicality, from the hundreds of the slain I have absorbed.

Such is the power of Fusion.

Prepared, I make my way to the gates that guard the Ten Thousand Steps of Torment, the pathway into the Darkness. The guards there attempt to warn me, as they do each time an adventurer passes through, but I ignore them. I dissolve the gate with a touch, crumbling it from its whole being into intangible elements, save for a fine dust of iron. 

They will not be needing it, when I am done.

The first unfortunate creature to grace my path gives a snarl and sudden attack; it, too, dissolves into dust and gas, like the iron gate below. The weaker ones flee, and the strongest test their mettle. All evaporate before me.

Such is the power of Fission.

It take relatively little time to reach the Dark One, who seems suprised at my coming. He asks if I have come first to die, to which I answer, I am the only one. He laughs and calls me a fool. I simply keep walking towards him. He readies his blade, telling me that he would have pleasure in watching me die. 

I tell him his blade cannot help him now.

I am right, of course. It evaporates at a touch, despite the magic bonding it. That was my longest lesson; learning to separate magic from its enchanted object. His armor does the same, and as he begs for pause, for audience, for talks, he disappears into ash. The only remaining piece his helmet, a fine piece of blackened adamantine, twisting into horns not unlike that of a demon. I reach down to collect my prize, my proof.

As soon as I touch it, a chill spreads over my body; a presence felt. It, and I stand for some moments, before it whispers to me harsh Truths. 

The Darkness in this world, it said, must exist.

It shows me a future of chaos, of destruction and death. Without a Great Evil to fight, the people will bicker and squabble, until bickering became separation, and squabbling became war. The conjoined races of this world would fall apart in disarray, fighting one another for the audacity of how they were born.

The Dark One I had slain, it whispered, was greedy and malevolent, wishing to further his power. But I? I was neigh but all-powerful. I didn't wish to become stronger, I was already the strongest. I, it said, could be the secret holder of peace; giving the world the Evil it needs, while giving it the least amount of death and destruction to do so. 

I knew, in that moment, what I had to do.

Without a second thought, with certainty in my mind, I placed the helmet upon my head.
