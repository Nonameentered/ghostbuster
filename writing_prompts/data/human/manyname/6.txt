**Give an Inch, Take a Kilo**

*(A cmpunk attempt)*

Mr. Brown entered the bakery, ready to indulge in his favorite treat. He could already taste the perfect, crumbly delectable, and could smell the dozens of other desserts for the taking. He was lucky, too, as the only other customer was an older gentleman, taking his time on his selection, though seemingly ready to order.

"Excuse me, young miss," the older man wheezed.

The perky cashier, with the sunlit smile, beamed to the gentleman. Ah, how her smile lit up Mr. Brown's day!

"Welcome sir, how may I help you?"

"Yes, I'd like a slice of this pound cake, please."

Mr. Brown and the cashier freezed. The cashier looked suddenly very nervous.

"I...I'm afraid I don't quite understand, sir."

Mr. Brown understood her nervousness, and shared in it too; he, however, assumed that this older gentleman, in his twilight years, had forgotten about the Conversion. A minor slight, only needing reminder. He spoke up.

"Miss, I believe he means a slice of the *half-kilo* cake, there."

The man looked annoyed, but Mr. Brown had dealt with this before. His father, bless his soul, also had some issues in the Conversion. The cashier looked slightly relieved, responding, "Oh yes, of course! Will there be anything else?"

"A cup of milk," the gentleman grumbled.

"A *glass* of milk," Mr. Brown corrected.

"For fuck's sake," he responded. Mr. Brown attempted to calm him, but he spoke before either of the younger two could speak. "If I had known it was going to be like this, I never would have voted for the Conversion."

This came as a surprise to the younger two; for the cashier, the foul language spouted before her. For Mr. Brown, the hypocrisy of voting for the Conversion whilst spitting in the face of it. Neither got to process their feelings, as the old man continued.

"The Conversion was supposed to bring us together to a mutual understanding; an agreeance of a universal set of units. *Not* so that a bunch of pedantic fascists could jail anyone they want! For fuck's sake, a pound cake was called a *pound* cake for a reason, but even if it's a *half-kilo*, it's still a damn pound cake! It has transversed its original meaning! 'Pound cake' is a *style* of cake, regardless of its fucking true weight! A cup is a glass, and vice versa!"

The young cashier backed away from the man; while Mr. Brown calmly did the same. Several seconds later, people dressed in black and body armor entered the shop, throwing a black bag over the old man's head, and cuffs on his wrists. As quickly as they entered, they left; old man in tow, never to be seen again.

There was silence, for some time, before Mr. Brown let out a sigh he hadn't realized he was holding. He had tried his best, he supposed. Though it hurt his heart to watch another old man, like his father, dragged away. Finally, he smiled to the cashier, pulling out his wallet, signalling he was ready to order.

No reason to let the day *end* in sadness, there was still cake to be had.
