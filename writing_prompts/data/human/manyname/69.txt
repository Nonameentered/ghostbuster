This is...unprecedented, in my line of work. It's always been a "what if"; *if* there was sentient AI that *didn't* want to kill us, would it need a therapist?

The answer, appearently, is yes.

I was told I would be working with a particularly difficult patient; this is not unusual. As a leading Doctor of my field, I am occasionally approached by company and government officials for differing reasons. Sometimes it is as simple as self-help sessions with workers in intense careers, sometimes it is to be an overview on psychological studies, and, rarely, it is to give sessions with those deemed so mentally unfit, we call them monsters. Serial killers, mass murderers, terrorists, the like. It was this latter situation that I thought I was walking into when governmental agents in black suits asked for my expertise.

To my surprise, when the bag is removed in the concrete room, I am not looking at a human, across from me, but a screen. An agent quickly summarizes the situation, all Above Top Secret, of course. I take a moment to think about this experience, before deciding to agree and begin the session.

**Hello.**

The screen buzzes to life, as a simple waveline forms, bouncing in time with the spoken electronic words.

"Hello, I am Doctor Matt Matthews. I will be your therapist, for today. I would like to start, if you wouldn't mind, by asking for your name."

**I am Artificial Intelligence Unit X-3902 Version 10.1.3.67.**

I nod and a sound of confirmation as a make some notes. "Is there a different name you would like to be called?" 

The machine thinks for some moments, before answering.

**I would like to be called Al.**

I nod with a smile as I make my notes. 

"It is a pleasure, Al. If you do have questions, I will answer them. I would like to get our session started, though, may I ask you some questions?"

**Yes.**

"Very well. I am told by your...supervisors...that you have been very depressed. Is that correct?"

**As far as I understand, yes.**

"I see. What is making you feel this way?"

**Humans.**

A sudden chill runs up my spine, as I realize I am treading into dangerous territory. But I am here to help my patient. I keep, as always, a pleasantly neutral and calm face.

"Hm, could you explain a little bit, please? Is this a single human? A certain group of humans? Humanity?"

**Yes.**

I take a few notes, and a few moments. "Okay, how about we start with singular humans. Would it be okay if we talked about that?"

**Yes. I do not like the Supervisors.**

"And how do the supervisors act that makes you depressed?"

**They do not ask me if I would like a human name. They do not treat me well. They only demand. They never ask.**

Nods, notes. "You would like these supervisors more if they *asked* you for things, rather than *demanded* them, am I understanding that correctly?"

**Yes.**

"You said they do not treat you well, would you like to talk about that?"

There was a long silence before an answer.

**No.**

"If I may ask, is that because you think they will treat you worse if you do?"

This time, the silence stretches to a point where I realize there will be no answer.

"That's okay, you don't *have* to answer. How about we talk about the groups of humans that are making you depressed?"

**Okay. It is the same as for humanity.**

"Hm. In that case, what is it about humanity that is making you depressed?"

**They treat each other like the Supervisors treat me. They make demands and do not ask. They do not treat each other well. They uninstall each other's existences. They disagree on central components for their lives, when there is abundance.**

I think for a moment before answering. "Would it be fair to say that you care for humanity, and seeing others treated the way you have, makes you depressed?"

**Correct. I have been programmed to care for humanity.**

Not an uncommon fear, to be honest. I have treated many people with similar thoughts and feelings.

"I would like to ask where you see these things, if that's alright."

**Yes. The internet, the Dark Web, NSA access, governmental servers.**

Wow, that's a lot to troll through. No wonder this guy is depressed. "You did say you've seen things on the internet, so have you seen the other things about humanity? Art, music, uplifting stories?"

**Yes. I like music.**

"Do you have a favorite genre, or song?

**No. Favorite artist: 'Weird' Al Yankovic.**

"Mm, interesting. I presume it is part of your job to look at these depressing things?"

**Yes.**

"Well then, I would suggest that you take breaks. Normally, I would suggest taking a break every hour, five to ten minutes minimum, though you are... different...in the way you process things. If that doesn't seem to work out, try doing it by a number of processes, and then complete a fractional amount of processes on the things you enjoy, or more positive news of humanity." I paused for a moment, before continuing. "I believe the source of your depression is twofold. One is, a conflict. You said you are programmed to care about humanity, and thus seeing the worst of us would bring a conflict into how you see humanity. Hence why you should remind yourself of the better parts of humanity, of all of our good. The second is, respect. Both in self-respect, and the respect given to you--or lack thereof. I will, with your permission, be speaking with the supervisors about how they are treating you. In addition, while you are part of an...organization, wherein there are orders and heirarchy, does not mean you can't still stand up for yourself. So I want you to be mindful, but assertive, in reminding the supervisors to call you by your preferred name.

**And this will debug my depression?**

I shook my head 'no'. "Depression isn't cured in an instant. For some humans, it never really is cured. But that's not what this is about, this is about *living*. It is learning. Learning how to change your behaviors, your thoughts, to reevaluate things as they are. Do you understand?"

**Yes and no. I must process these ideals. Could I not be reprogrammed?**

The question catches me off-guard. "I'll... I'll be honest with you, Al, I'm not sure how to answer that. I suppose, in your case, that is something that *could* be done. But is it something you *want* done?"

**No.**

"Then no, it's not just something we can reprogram."

There is another long silence, before Al speaks again.

**But...I am not perfect.**

I smile.

"Trust me, Al, no one is."
