It had been a normal Saturday night, when it happened.

Hera and I had been hanging out at my house, having some drinks, watching a TV show. Talking about life and work, decompressing from the stress. I always looked forward to our hangouts; Hera was certainly wise beyond my years, even beyond hers. That, and the company was appreciated. It was nice to have a friend that wasn't one from work. Not to diss on my boys, they're all great, and we definitely were close, too. Just, sometimes, you need someone outside of your circle to talk to.

Thankfully, I could provide the same for her. Something outside her circle. She came from a rich family, with a powerful husband that could basically get her anything she wanted. And, for a time, she did; got anything and everything she wanted. Then, I guess she did something to piss her hubby off. He sent her here, and planned to cut contact for a year. He wasn't a monster, as he set up a paid place to live, and kept an automatic allowance for commodities. Still rubbed me the wrong way, but marriage, I'm told, can be weird like that. Through our friendship, I taught her a thing or two about budgeting, on housework, how to live like us 'normal' folk. And, of course, provided a shoulder to cry on, when necessary, as much as she did for me.

I suppose to have said it was a 'normal' night is a bit of a lie, as Hera brought a gift from her family. 'Ambrosia', she called it, a special brandy from Greece. Stuff was dangerous; strong as double-proofed whisky, and sweet as a dessert wine. Needless to say, we were both a bit further drunk than we intended to be. It was halfway through jokingly complaining about the terrible sitcom we were watching, laughing at our own jokes. It was after a good laugh we looked at each other, and she had a perculiar look in her eyes.

"What?", I asked, a little drunk and confused.

She answered back with a kiss. Not a friendly peck, not a light flirty kiss; a *kiss*. A kiss of conviction and meaning. I lost myself for a moment, before pushing her off.

"Wait, hold on, no..." I give an exhale of frustration and to steady myself. "We...we can't. You're married. That's...we can't."

She herself, looked frustrated and on the verge of tears. "And? My bastard of a husband has cheated on me numerous occasions! He'd be getting what he deserves!"

I took a moment to stop the bile and anger welling in my throat, swallowing down. "That... doesn't make it right, Hera." I paused to take a deep breath, to steady my thoughts, before continuing. "Besides, even if *I* didn't care, the law does. A: We're both drunk as ducks, and can't really give consent. B: this state legally frowns upon cheating in marriages."

She buried her face into my shoulder, to give a scream of frustration. "It's not fair! It's not! You make me feel *safe*, like I can be me! I don't want to go back!"

Her cries, while understandable, were also a bit confusing. "Then...don't." She gave me a confused look. "I mean, I assume that's why y'all separated for a year, to consider your marriage, yeah? I mean, I'm not a therapist, and y'all sound like you need one, no offense, but if you're happier away from your husband, maybe that's a sign."

She sat in thought for a moment, to the point I started to wonder if she somehow sobered up in the past minute. She finally gave a sigh, and thought aloud. "I *do* suppose as long as everything is handled correctly, there shouldn't be a problem with my position...still not a *great* look, but..." She seemed lost in her own little world, thinking, and planning. 

She was right, it wasn't fair.

But that night was enough for her to really consider her marriage. She ended up going back, but her conviction was clear; if she and her husband couldn't make it work, she was divorcing him. They tried therapy for a year, half of it together, before separating again. Turns out, her husband is a *real* piece of shit. Had no less than a dozen side pieces, the whole time. Was even pulled into the courtroom, once, as the POS thought she had cheated on him with me. Turned the tables on that motherfucker, though; I told the truth about her complaints to me about *his* cheating ass. 

Needless to say, Hera got what she demanded. I guess she still loved him enough not to take everything and the kitchen sink, but she was able to gain enough to start a business to continue her more wealthy lifestyle. I kinda understood what she meant after she started the business; definitely saw some smear campaigns against her, 'Divorc√© Starts Wedding Planning Business: What A Joke!' and the like. Hera, intelligent Hera, with all the grace and attitude of the goddess of her namesake, simply used the smear as fuel. Refuted that anything about it was wrong, and simply stated that "Every wedding is special, even if it's not your first."

So, uh, yeah. Kinda got off track there, but that's how I met my girlfriend. Intelligent, beautiful, fiery Hera. It's funny, how close the that old legend of the Greek goddess she is; though I suppose 'life imitates art', and all that.

Speaking of off-topic, I also punched her ex-husband in his stupid fucking face. In *self-defense*, of course. But that's a whole tangential story...
