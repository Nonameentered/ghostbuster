**Reville to Taps**

*(A milpunk attempt)*

0400

Reville sounds. Specialist Grant rises from his bed, making haste to dress. PT clothes; he can't be late again. Sargent will cuss him out, again. He'll have to run the base, again.

0420

PT formation. SPC Grant is on time, if only barely. A new boot, forgetting to tuck in their shirt, distracts Sargent from chewing him out. Today PT Leader wears a deep frown than usual, meaning they will not want to have a long PT session. Today is a good day.

0520

Back in the barracks. Waiting to shower. Shower three opens up. Shower three, SPC Grant knows, has the shittiest water pressure. Instead, he offers the boot behind him shower three. Boot is suspicious, but SPC Grant reflects by saying he's waiting for shower two, his favorite. Technically, not a lie. Boots have to learn somehow.

0600

Breakfast formation. Yellow slop, labeled as scrambled eggs. Grey slop, labeled as oatmeal. Orange juice. All in name only, and all tasting the same. But "food is fuel", as Sargent reminds a boot. Boots have to learn somehow.

0630

Training begins. Rifle training, marching, commands. Classroom training; identification of friends and foe, propaganda of allies and enemies. Kill the Traitors. Glory to the Nation. Obey the Commander In Chief.

The alarm sounds. There is no exercise. An active attack. Take shelter. Take shelter. Take shelter. SPC Grant, practiced in his ways, drops everything to duck under a nearby cover. But he sees a boot, stupid and frozen. Scared, like a deer in headlights. Stupid boot. SPC Grant, against better judgement, moves with haste to grab the boot, tossing the kid into the cover. Too late, for SPC Grant. Mortar finds its target, and SPC Grant is spread over an area of five meters. 

Boots have to learn somehow.
