**More Than Magical**

*(An arcanepunk attempt)*

Teddy clutched the stolen book in his hands, keeping an eye out for Magi-Police. He winced at every cart rolling by overhead. "Are you sure about this?"

His partner scoffed at his fear, shaking up a rattle can. "It'll be fine, Ted. We're just...expediting the next chapter of Arcane Arts, is all." 

Ted bit his lip. "But we're Normies...what if the Magi's are right? What if we can't cast? What if the Weave rejects our call?"

His partner stopped for a moment, placing a hand on Ted's shoulder. "Listen--hey, listen to me. It'll be *fine*. They're *wrong*. We can cast just the same as the rest of them, we just gotta be more...specific."

Ted was still nervous, but nodded. They came this far, after all. They should see it to the end.

His partner nodded back, then shook up the can one last time. "Alright, hold open the book to page 57."

Ted did as instructed, while keeping an eye over his shoulder for MPs. His partner spritzed the ground with neon-colored paint, first in as perfect a circle as possible, then interlacing it with circles and lines and symbols within it. They then went around certain spots, placing more stolen contraband within certain circles and atop certain symbols.

Ted amazed at how well his friend could replicate magic circles with minimal effort, before being brought back to reality with his friend's voice. Standing in the center of the circle, he smiled to Ted. "Alright, make some magic."

Ted flipped the book around with a nod, pausing to read the spell and it's incantation. It was only then that he realized the ulterior motives of his friend. He smiled, with tears in his eyes. "Merlin's beard, you're actually doing it."

"Naturally. Only chance I'm going to get."

"What if I mess it up?"

"There is no one I would trust more than you to do this. I believe in you."

Ted finally gave a final smile and nod, before clearing his throat and chanting the incantation. Nothing seemed to happen at first, but Ted continued, willing whatever forces of the Weave to hear his words, and to grant his request. 

Just as he finished the second verse, with willful tears in his eyes, the neon color gave way to light and smoke of the same hue. He continued, as light and smoke gave way into brighter light and cracks of lightning; Ted's fear of MPs relieved as he grew louder, commanding the Weave to do as was instructed.

Then, as soon as the incantation ended, so did the sound and light. The smoke slowly sank, revealing his friend; now, though, sporting a feminine body in place of the male one she once had. She smiled, looking over her new body. "Merlin's beard, it worked." 

The tell-tale sign of magi sirens off in the distance alerted the two to the incoming MPs. "No time for celebrating, we gotta make like Slytherin and fucking bail."

Ted smiled, running after with the book in tow.
