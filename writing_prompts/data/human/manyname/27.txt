I'm not a thief.

I'm not saying I didn't take it, I just wasn't going to steal it. I was going to give it back; I just wanted to go for a joyride. 

And boy, was it fun for the first couple of minutes. That car was *fast*. Like, *really* fast. It had all the bells and whistles, and then some. Easily the most fun I've ever had on a joyride.

I felt a little bad, I'll admit, when I took a look through the plastic bag in the passenger seat. Toiletries, mostly, a couple of snacks, a change of clothes. Someone on the run, maybe, or going on an extended road trip. It was with that thought I looked to the backseat, and saw the duffel bag. Again, I felt a little bad, but I wasn't about stealing. I wasn't going to take someone's shit. I was just borrowing without permission.

Still, curiousity clawed at me when I noticed that the bag didn't really move when I took some high-speed corners. That wasn't any duffel filled with clothes, that was for sure. Shit was *heavy*.

I shouldn't have looked.

But I did look. And my stomach dropped when I did. No wonder that bag was heavy, it was filled with cash. USD. Benjamins. Tens of thousands, I guessed. 

*No one* carries this amount of money, not anyone scrupulous, anyway. Not anyone willing to allow you to keep your kneecaps. I suppose it *could've* been some affluent kid running from their parents, but the more likely thing was that I just stole some crime boss's car. There might already be a target on my back already.

So, fight or flight kicked in. And, let me tell you, I ain't a fighter.

I drove.

In hindsight, it was stupid; I should've just ditched the car. No one knew *I* borrowed the car, only that it was 'stolen'. But I couldn't stop. It was like my hands were glued to the wheel, like my foot was made of lead, and my eyes wouldn't blink. I must've been miles outside of the city by the time I full control of myself, and by then it was too late to turn back.

So, all of that to say...I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry, and it'll never happen again. No more joyrides, for me, no sir. And I didn't touch a thing, other than to look at it. All the money's still there, swear on my Mom's grave. Okay, I ate the snacks, but I didn't touch a single dollar, I swear. And the car is perfect, not a single dent or a scratch, almost as if it was never driven. Well, except for the gas, she's empty now, and it would be wise to have the engine oil checked, just in case; but otherwise perfectly fine.

You want me to work for you? Well, I guess my only question is do I keep my kneecaps if I say no?

I see.

When do I get started?
