Something was wrong.

The others didn't believe me, save for the Strategist. They too noted the new peculiarity of the monsters; their attacks were lesser in number, striking in opportune times and locations, and sparing many more noncombatants than before. The others waived this away as the nearing of the end; we were strong, soon strong enough to take on the Dark Foe. He was afraid, they postured, and bolstered his defenses, his army. Saving them for us.

But it was *wrong*.

This was hit and run, tactics you hear about in the history books of our old world. The Dark Foe, it seems, was mimicking that which we were vaguely familiar with. Being as close to these people as I am, I hear stories of those surrendering to the monsters, for them to be spared. Mere months ago this was an impossibility. *Why?* More importantly, why *now*? For decades the Dark Foe has been allowing his army to run amok and do as they please, causing chaos in their wake. 

The Strategist thinks it is a denial of resources; with Heroes on the loose, the more monsters we slay, the more we use our abilities, the faster we grow. I do not disagree with them, entirely, but the *timing* still doesn't make sense. The Dark Foe would have done that years ago, not when we are nearly ready. No, *something* has changed. He has new information. But how?

Oh.

Oh no.

*Oh no.*

Our classmate, the twenty-fifth of our two dozen heroes. The one who did not receive a title or a dazzling ability. In truth, their ability sounded very nice for a craftsman, but was untenable for combat. But he was *from our world*. And we have not seen him in nearly *ten years*. I, myself, do not accuse of treason, though the others certainly suggest it. They are angry.

It is our fault, regardless, I remind them. Whether they have been captured against their will, or turned willingly against us, *we turned our backs*. We never took the time to check in *in ten years*.

The others are somber at this reminder, and agree to a pact; check in on our old friend. If they are missing, we make no assumptions. If they are captured, we save them. If they have turned, we turn them back.

Our fears, of course, are put anew when we visit the capitol. The last that was seen of them, they marched past the gate into the Ten Thousand Steps of Torment, straight into the Darkness, right for the Dark Foe. They have not been seen since, and officially have been declared as dead, a hero for their efforts. A formality, in these lands, as none dare to cross the gates to retrieve the body. 

A chill runs up my spine. What if they have been tortured this whole time? What if they *are* dead? 

But I keep these worries to myself. I, as a representative of the Divines, as Healer of body and soul, must push us towards the positives. They are still alive. We can still rescue them.

It is decided then and there; ready or not, we must face the Dark One. Perhaps, we will not defeat him this day, but we can at least find and rescue our comrade. 

As we enter through the gates, we are immediately attacked by an ambush. Weaker creatures, nothing we can't handle. Barely leave scratches. But again, unease sets in; instead of attacking all at once, as before, they attack in smaller waves. They go for weak points and weak spots, to the best of their abilities. They focus on us in the backlines, while distracting the frontline fighters. As the smaller ones flee in defeat, we push onward. 

Unease; there are no attacks from the more medium of creatures. It is not until another trap is sprung that we know how far we have gotten; the smaller creatures man the traps and attack at range, using smoke bombs and gaseous poison to confuse and sicken us. The medium creatures defensively fight the frontline, while the strongest of the monsters attack our rear line, threatening our most vulnerable. We survive, though it is not a victory. The monsters flee again.

So on, and so on, through the Ten Thousand Steps. It is tiring, and exhausting our magics and resources. But we *must* push on. We must find our friend. Victory is not the mission here, it is rescue.

Finally, we reach the end of the Ten Thousand Steps, where the strongest of the monsters stand, ready and waiting. Before either side may attack, however, a command is shouted. The monster sheath their weapons, and the cold stone doors grind open. We are being summoned.

He beckons us.
