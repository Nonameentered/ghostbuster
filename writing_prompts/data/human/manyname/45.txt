"All rise for the Honorable Judge Vindicus."

The intoduction audio clip signaled to the anonymous audience the start of a new stream. Only, as some viewers noted, something was different. Nowhere to be seen, as before, the preparations for a night's hunt. No weapons, no new place, no cameras on suspect networks. Just an empty chair, devoid of the accused. 

"All be seated."

Then, the Judge revealed himself; sporting black tactical gear, and his trademark white mask. He sat in the chair, with a pistol in one hand, and a remote in the other. The chat exploded with an equal part of confused questions and practiced memes.

"Now, then, I suppose it is time to get started. Today will be a bit different than we're used to, as there have been some significant changes on the List recently."

The List; an unofficial website quoing the official UN listing for the world's most dangerous and distasteful villains. Where the next of the Accused would be selected to be judged; and, more often than not, executed. The Judge sat silent for a minute, for both buffering and effect, before clicking a button on the remote. The screen splits, still showing the Judge, but revealing the List as well.

Again, the chat exploded into a blur of confusion and anger, as.the top of the List read: "Judge Vindicus".

"Order! I will have order in my Court!" The Judge warns sternly, though there is a chuckle beneath it. "Now, as you can see, it seems our dear friends at the UN have decided they've had enough of me. I suppose three-dozen Judgements is just one too many. As such, seeing as I am the Accused, I cannot be my own Judge; so we shall once again have a trial by jury. Let us begin!"

Clicking through a presentation, the Judge calmly presents the evidence. "Over the past five years, the Accused has been charged with the murder of thirty-six people. Thirty-six men and women. I will remind that, while the Accused was acting as Executioner of the Court, and all thirty-six people were guilty of crimes of their own, that this Court is one of Vengeance and True Justice, and is not recognized by any legal authority." 

He pauses, again, then continues. "However, the deaths of the thirty-six the Accused is accused of murdering *have* brought positive change in the world. At the lower echelons, the death of one Johnson Doe II, previous CEO of PriviTech Inc., revealed an underage sex trafficking ring within the industry, which more...*certified* Courts were able to crack down upon with impunity, without his protection. At the higher echelons, the death of one Abimbola ZÃ¡dor, warlord to a region of Africa, saw the fall of a petty local government, a raise of a rebellion, and a formation of a jewel of democracy in a harsh land."

Judge Vindicus perused through his crimes, pausing now and again for the chat. He covered each of the thirty-six deceased in detail, halfway between a Court show of evidence, and a reminiscing montage. Once finished, the chat riled up, he clicked the remote once again. A prompt to all viewers, to vote: **Guilty** or **Not Guilty**?

Overwhelmingly, the chat voted "Guilty", to which Judge Vindicus chuckled happily to.

"My, what an honor to be Judged by so many souls bound by justice. You, who do not let fandom blind you. You, who know what justice means. Now then, Jury, what is your verdict?"

He clicked the remote again, and put the pistol to his head. The chat was given two options, again:

**DEATH** or **FREEDOM**?
