I knew this was our way of life, in the industry. Work the most out of a man, promising the moon, and cut them free just before we have to pay the real big bucks; *that's* how you keep people in line. But never me; I was smart, strategic. I knew how much to give, and how much to ask when boss-man wanted more. I knew how to be firm, yet polite.

In addition, I basically *started* this company, I was the second person hired. In fifteen years, I forged this company from nobody into Fortune 500. I can't take all the credit, of course; boss-man had the vision, I was the hammer.

But now, it seems, he no longer thinks he needs a hammer. He no longer thinks he need to keep the forge fed. Just before my promotion, to partner, to own a piece of this company we have forged *together*; he cuts me loose. Fifteen years, on the *dot*; then, fired.

I'm not mad he did this; again, it's standard practice. I'm mad he did it to *me*. Truthfully, I am more than mad: I am livid, I am vengeful, I wish to incurr wrath upon him. I wish to take my pound of gold in flesh.

But, as I said, I am smart, and strategic.

What ol' boss-man seems to not recollect is that I was with him *every* step of the way. And what he doesn't know is that I've recorded every step. The coke-fuelled benders he went on? I've got the photos and videos to prove it. The 'allegations' of sexual crimes? Gee, I wonder who filmed it for him. The falsification of documents to the government? I kept the email traffic. The lies to the IRS? I've got the ledger.

I understand that, in doing so, I will likely go to prison myself. I witnessed these crimes, after all, and said nothing. But as his *worker*, I have reasons I can say I didn't come forward for: fear of retaliation, for example. Probably cut a couple of years to the sentence, plus, I hear buying into a plea bargain cuts a couple more. I've also never been *involved*, myself, which is bound to help.

Him, though? He's **fucked**.

At least, he will be, if he doesn't do exactly.

As I.

*Fucking*.

Say.
