**Rock, No Roll**

*(A cavepunk attempt)*

Ogg was awoken by his clansman, Gug, grunting and low hooting signaling something to see. Ogg begrudgingly got up, hoping it wasn't another report of the big cats. Following the excited clansman, he was surprised to see a pile of sticks, mimicing the form of the rejuvenation of the Fire. 

Ogg grunted questioningly, motioning towards the pile. Was Gug going to split the Fire? It had been done before, but would take the permission of the Shaman. Otherwise, it would be stealing, which would be Bad.

Gug nodded, and made motions to watch. He picked up two rocks; one a glossy black, and another a shiny grey. He took the two, and, as demonstration, smacked the two against each other. To Ogg's surprise, there came a shower of small dots of Fire. Gug then did it again, this time closer to the sticks and grass. He slammed the rocks together until some of the grass caught, and then gently blew on the small Fire until it grew, making a new Fire.

While Gug celebrated his success, Ogg was uncertain. He remembered the Shaman, and how they warned of playing with fire. That Fire was Good, but can be used for Bad. Anyone caught playing with Fire was subject to Punishment. 

Ogg made a judgement, based on the teachings of the Shaman.

He allowed his genuine surprise show, seeming impressed. Then, he looked curiously off into the distance, as though the light revealed something new. Gug, noting this, turned to look. Once he did, Ogg took a stone into his hand, and did what he must.

As the limp body fell, Ogg he would would miss his friend. But it was for the better of the cave. It wasbest not to anger the Great Spirits that gave them Fire; what if they never were given fire again? And better for Gug, too; rather than be a blasphemer, he would die in a *terrible accident*. His spirit would roam the Caves of the Ancestors, rather than be eaten by the Big Cat.

His task completed, Ogg made his way back to his pile of grass, and slept.
