**Uncle Jiaola had always been a respectable enchanter.** The art of storing magic in an object without a soul was difficult and exhausting, but it paid the bills. And it was a field of magic that I'd had little experience with until now, so I was excited to take a peek around Jiaola's new workshop.

"Mind the corners," Jiaola said, gesturing at the towering doorway of black stone. "I'm not actually sure what that rock is, but it chips easily and it's *sharp*."

I frowned at the doorway, peering through to the roomy workshop behind, then walked around the back of the door. There was nothing on the other side. "Is this..."

"Permanent rift into the Plane of Elemental Heat," Jiaola said. "It's a pain in the butt to build anything there—normally, it's so hot that water just *boils* if you leave it out—but it's the only elemental plane that city zoning laws would let me grow into. Plus, it's great advertising for the heatproofing."

I poked my head into the workshop. It was surprisingly cool, considering that it was located in a dimension hot enough to instantly vaporize water. Tentatively, I stepped inside. A table with a saw and a hammer sat to one side, some wooden planks strewn on its surface in some abandoned work of craftsmanship. On the other side, a worn grindstone sat, a shovel to its side. But the pride and centerpiece of Jiaola's workshop was the gleaming stone table in the center of a well-stocked library. I tentatively opened my soulsight, confirming my suspicion—each and every book was packed with power.

"Storing magic in something without a soul is difficult," Jiaola explained, stepping up behind me. "So I cheat. Some objects naturally gain souls over time, fragments of memory and emotion left behind by people who cherish and love them. And if you want to get the most bang for your buck in terms of objects with souls... well, it's hard to get any better than a well-worn library book."

I stepped into the library and cautiously took a book off the shelf. Even with my soulsight barely open, I could practically *feel* the memories contained within the book, leaping at my touch like an eager wolf pup.

Jiaola picked up the shovel from the side, his eyes gleaming. "So. Want to learn how an enchanter works magic?"
