**"The first thing you have to understand about magic is that it isn't all flashy,"** Jiaola said. "Sure, some mages might be able to blow up buildings or tear rifts between worlds, but magic is more than that."

"I know, Jiaola," I whispered. I took a sip from my cup, letting the savory drink warm my throat. The small, rented room in the attic of an inn wasn't quite home, but... home wasn't really somewhere I wanted to be reminded of right now, anyway.

"...right. Sorry." Jiaola scratched his head awkwardly. "Most of the time, when the odd kid came over to learn more about magic, it was some rebel who thought they'd learn how to bully people better. Old habits die hard."

"Yeah, well, so did Iola after I shrank him to death." I met Jiaola's eyes. "I'm not here to learn how to kill people better, Jiaola. I'm done with fighting."

Jiaola hesitated. "I... oh. I'm sorry. I just assumed that, after everything, you'd... want to learn to defend yourself. For the next time."

I shook my head. "What next time, Jiaola? I killed Iola because he was fucking insane, and he was too strong to stop in any other way. But now I'm safe. I'm away from the war. I don't want to be a soldier."

"Then what do you want to be?"

I spread my arms out in a helpless shrug. "That's why I'm here, Jiaola. I *know* that magic is more than violence. But I... I don't know what else it is. I just want to learn how to be... something new."

And Jiaola smiled.

"You're a lot wiser than I was at your age," Jiaola said.

I waved a hand. "Yeah, yeah, insert self-deprecating comment here. You're a magic carpenterâ€”I'm sure you know a thing or two about using magic to help people, instead of hurt them."

"I do," Jiaola said, holding out a hand. "And if I'm right, then so do you."

I blinked. "I... what?"

"Do you want me to show you how?"

I nodded.

"Then take my hand," Jiaola said, "and let's begin."
