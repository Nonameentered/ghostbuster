**"Not all hunters seek to kill their quarry,"** I explained. "For instance, you do not seek to kill me."

That was up for debate, considering that Silver On His Soul had pinned me against the wall, fangs bared, with three of his cronies in the alley behind the Hunters' Guild. But hey, if they wanted me dead, things were about to devolve beyond the point of words either way. 

"You speak swiftly," Silver hissed. "As mortals do. *We* are mortal no longer, thanks to the threat our order exists to eliminate. Claiming otherwise is an insult to the generations of souls twisted by the Oldest Horror."

"I am not your order," I said. "I simply wish to train with it."

"For what reason?" Silver tightened his grip on my neck; I wove a spell of freedom to draw air into my lungs. If the vampire hunters noticed my spell, they didn't show it. "You have no vengeance to pursue against the Eldest Raceâ€”so what right do you have to learn our trade?"

"I want to *find* a vampire. Not to slay him. Your order knows many secrets of tracking that I do not."

"Secrets which would be ruined if they reached the wrong ears," Silver hissed.

"I swore the same oaths that you all did, enforced by magic and memory. I am incapable of spreading those secrets."

"You claim so, yet you wield magics from wintry peaks whose comprehension we lack," Silver growled. "All things end: this truth is writ in the bones of the world. Who can say if the oaths you have taken are sufficient to bind you?"

Well, he had a point there. I was no master of magic, but I'd had a formal education and a trial by fire that gave me a breadth and depth of comprehension beyond the relatively narrowly-focused Hunter's guild. The constructs of memory in my soul were rotated into dimensions that most would find inaccessible, but I could easily deconstruct the oath-spell with a few moments of concentration. "If there is nothing I can say that would change your mind," I said, "we may as well skip to the part where you try to kill me."

Perhaps it was something in my tone of voice, or perhaps the vampire hunters really were that afraid of my foreign magics, because it was that of all things that got Silver to set me down.

"Give us your stakes," Silver said, and for a heartbeat I thought he meant the weapons. He must have realized the ambiguity too, because he clarified, "What drives you to seek out the secrets of tracking so badly?"

Ah. "A very short time ago... a vampire spoke four things to me. Four sentences that upended my life." I narrowed my eyes. "With everything I have learned between then and now, I would *very* much like to speak with him again."

Silver regarded me beneath a cold, pale moon.

Then he stepped aside.

"You will be watched," he warned. "But you will learn to watch just as well."

I stepped out of the alleyway, to where the Hunters' guild loomed.

Then I opened the door and stepped within.
