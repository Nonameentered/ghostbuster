**"And you know the worst part?"** I slugged back the cup of grainy black coffee that was the only drink they served at the Hero's Journey. I wasn't sure what was worse: the fact that we'd been fighting the Order of Valhalla for so long that people had started setting up cafes near the battlefields, or the fact that I'd been starved of a good coffee for so long that I'd settle for this swill.

"What?" Vivia asked, leaning in.

I slammed down my mug. "I looked at the history books. This isn't even the first time the Order and the Academy have clashed. Twenty years back, there were speeches and rallies about how this would be the *last time* we'd ever have to charge into this nest of villainy and scum—and they had to specify the *last* time, because a decade before *that*, the Order and the Academy were yapping at each other's heels again. Sending their finest graduates to live as heroes or die as villains on the same fucking battlefield over and over and over again."

"Hey, I feel you. I was *there* for the Silent Crusade." She was? Huh. I thought she was a new recruit—any veterans of the Silent Crusade were too highly-ranked to talk to a mere *sidekick* like me. "You see this?" She pointed out the window of the simple wooden cafe, towards the sparkling shores of Feardust Lake.

I nodded. "Yeah. The Witch of Warp and Weft is going to fly out there tomorrow and probably kick some demonic butt."

"Well, it wouldn't be the first time," Vivia said. "Feardust Lake used to be an ordinary section of plains, before the clash between the Order of Valhalla and the Silent Peaks turned it into Feardust Crater."

I whistled under my breath. "Rifts. There's not going to be anything *left* in a century, if they keep trying to kill each other at this rate."

"Yeah," Vivia said, then frowned. "They? You're... you're with the Silent Peaks, aren't you?"

I grimaced. "Yeah. You're right. If *we* don't keep trying to kill each other."

Vivia's eyes met mine, and I saw something solemn and hopeful in her gaze. "Well... *we* don't have to keep fighting."

I raised my eyebrows. "What?"

"I mean... look. Let's say, hypothetically speaking, you had two combatants in a battle, one from either side. Both of them, mostly helpless. Both of them, sick of fighting. And if they fought each other anyway, the only thing they'd accomplish would be getting each other killed. It... even if they cared about their side of the fight, it wouldn't hurt either side if both of them just... mutually agreed to walk away. They achieve the same thing they would have if they'd died on the battlefield, but... they get to live another day."

I laughed nervously. "I mean, yeah. I... I could live with that. But... you know. I'd have to *find* an enemy soldier first, you know? And get to know her. Talk to her for long enough that I'd trust her to stay away from the battlefield, too."

"Or you could go with her," Vivia idly said, twirling a lock of hair around one finger. "And we could be free of this stupid conflict, forever."

"I mean—but you're not—" I started to chuckle.

Then something occurred to me.

Vivia said she'd been present at the last Silent Crusade.

She hadn't said on which *side*.

She was an agent of the enemy. My instincts blared at me to sound the alarm—

But I took a deep breath. She was also *Vivia*. And... she had made me an offer. One that didn't even end up feeling like a betrayal of my mentor.

"Oh," I said.

"Oh," Vivia repeated.

"...Meet you at sundown? Shore of the lake?" I asked.

Vivia's eyes twinkled. "I'll see you there."

I grinned and stood, and—for what was hopefully the last time—jogged towards my tent, to pack my things and leave this eternal conflict behind.
