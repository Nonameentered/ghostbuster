**Agonizingly, the shattered fragments of my soul melted together in the demond's hands.** Moments later, a body coalesced into existence around what was left of my soul, and Zhytln stepped back, wiping blood off of his worn bartender's suit.

I blinked once, the stench of sulfur and the howling red glare assaulting my temporary body, and grimaced.

"How long have I been dead for?" I asked.

Zhytln held up a hand and wiggled it side to side. "Seventeen, eighteen years? Long enough that your sons have grown up."

I exhaled. Sacrificing Quianna's unborn child had been painful, but we would have all been killed in the yearly witch-raids without a protector of some kind. Even if the rifts that had opened in the final battle had killed me, it was a relief to know that the sacrifice had not been in—

Wait.

Sons?

"Did Quianna... no, she couldn't have been pregnant. Did I have another child that I was unaware of?"

Zhytln scoffed. "Perhaps, but that is not my concern. I deal in *souls*, not flesh; your children are those whose hearts and minds you have impacted as a parental figure, not those whose bodies you have helped form."

A chill went down my spine. "Then—the other children in the village—"

Zhytln waved away my concerns. "Please. You may have been a kind man in life, but the connections in soulspace between you and the other children of the village is not nearly strong enough to pull one of their souls into my domain. No, the situation is complicated by the fact that a child whom you called a daughter has since revealed himself to be your son."

I paused. "Then—Sa—"

"His name is Cienne now," Zhytln absent-mindedly said. "I don't blame you for not knowing; there are few mortal witches who have enough talent to read the entirety of a soul at such a young age."

The demon's deceptively calm voice set me on edge. "I swear to you, on whatever is left of my soul, that I did not intend to deceive you when we made our deal," I said.

"Oh, I know," Zhytln absently said. "You're nothing but a soul now, and you're a soul in my domain. You could not deceive me if you tried. No, I've brought you back to consciousness in order to collect upon the debts I am rightfully owed."

I scowled. "I know your limitations, Zhytln. If you speak the truth, it's been over a decade since I've seen S—Cienne. Whatever bond between us there was has atrophied; you are not nearly strong enough to exploit what little connection remains to drag him here."

"Yes, the brute-force solution would be a rather inefficient affair," Zhytln agreed. "Fortunately, I have a rather more... elegant... way of convincing Cienne to visit me."

Oh.

The answer to a question I hadn't even thought to ask suffocated me like a sinkhole in harvest season.

"That's why you brought me back," I whispered.

Zhytln's lips quirked up infinitesimally. "Oh, I do so enjoy working with intelligent people."

"You have to know I won't help you," I said. "Not even if it means saving Alnel."

"Your willing assistance is not required," Zhytln replied. "All that I need is Cienne's curiosity, and your simple existence will suffice."

Then, before I could dodge, the demon swiped a hand.

The world *snapped* around me, evicting me from the afterlife and sending me sprawling into an unfamiliar city, my clothes still smoking from the fires of Zhytln's domain.
