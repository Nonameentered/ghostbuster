**The Knwharfhelm Guild of Associated Heroines had been the building's official name, once.** But decades of shortening and grumbling had eroded the grandiose nomenclature until the worn sign on the front door only said HEROINE. 

That was fine, in Eyhlzja's opinion. It got the important part across. Even a child could figure out the advertising—and in fact, a child did.

The girl was young, far too young to be an applicant, and she was grubby with dirt and a possibly-infected rash. Eyhlzja considered whether it would be polite to offer healing before simply asking, "Is there something I can help you with?"

The girl jumped, jerking back as if caught with her hand in a fruit stall. "My—my mommy's in trouble. Big trouble."

Eyhlzja tilted her head. "I'd be happy to help. Could you tell me what kind of trouble she's in?"

The girl looked down. "You have to promise not to be mad, okay? Mommy says people might get mad."

Eyhlzja shook her head. "As long as she's not hurting anyone, I won't get mad, okay?"

The girl nodded. "She's not. She's just hurt. She... she's sweating and shaking and throwing up all over, and she says she needs a herr-oh-in." The girl pronounced the last word slowly, as if unfamiliar with its weight. 

Eyhlzja wasn't going to begrudge the girl a mispronunciation or two; she got far worse botcheries of her own name all the time. Speaking of which... "What's your name?"

The girl kicked the dirt uncomfortably. "Lzyeht."

"Lzyeht. I'm Eyhlzja." Eyhlzja stepped around the counter. She riffled through her soul, turning a joyful memory into a spell; a hovering sign of light that read BE BACK SOON materialized above her desk. "Can you show me where your mother is?"

Lzyeht hesitated. "I can't pay. I don't even have a single coin."

Eyhlzja shook her head. "Helping others is payment enough," Eyhlzja said. Quite literally, in her case; the magics of forgiveness and joy that she wielded would only heighten in power from the aid she delivered to others. 

"Oh." Lzyeht smiled. "I think Momma would like you."

"Then why don't you introduce us?"

Lzyeht trotted out the door, Eyhlzja following. Though the path they took wound through alley-ways and darkened streets, Lzyeht proceeded with the grim determination of a child too young to understand death, but too old not to see its specter. 

Until Eyhlzja reached the cot, strung up in an alleyway, in which Lzyeht's mother was still seizing up, her arms scored with familiar marks.

The woman looked at Eyhlzja with wide, terrified eyes. "What... what is this? I said... no police..."

And Eyhlzja shook her head. "It's okay. It's okay. I see you. I see you."

She knelt down by the woman's side, reaching for her arms.

And with the magic woven into her soul, she *forgave*.

Vines of regrowth blossomed from Eyhlzja's soul, flashing as they met the woman's skin, until with a shocked, ragged breath, she took a deep breath in, eyes wide.

Then she shuddered and relaxed, her breathing normalizing, the shaking ceasing.

Lzyeht turned to Eyhlzja, eyes shimmering. "You did it! You—you really did it!"

Eyhlzja shook her head. "No, no. It was nothing."

Lzyeht spread her arms out. "It was my momma."

Eyhlzja couldn't help but laugh, embracing the little girl in the street.

The girl and the heroine knelt there, safe and warm, beside the deep, calm breaths of the woman whose life they'd saved.
