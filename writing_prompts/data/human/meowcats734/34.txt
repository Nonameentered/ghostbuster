**The grand vault doors were impenetrable, designed to withstand the fury of a nuclear blast.** It had taken a team of twenty engineers and two thousand work-hours just to design the thing, let alone the countless thousands of laborers who had turned it from idea into reality.

There was just one problem.

They locked from the outside. All two hundred and seventy-three of them, spread around the surface of the Earth.

"You should always listen to the people you hire to build your nuclear bunkers," Ada mused, broadcasting her words across the globe. "And you should *definitely* avoid saying that you'd leave us all in a radioactive wasteland, if push comes to shove."

"That conversation was held in private!" Sleve McDichael shouted from within his bunker, on camera stream six. Ada wrinkled her lip. He had a controlling share in the global water supply—emphasis on *had*. Ada suspected the livestreams of the wealthy weren't going to help his stock portfolio.

"And that's an admission," Ada said. "But don't worry; even though I hold a grudge, it's not my voice that really matters. You see, we're going to try out a little experiment. Bottom-up democracy, as it were. Some of my more astute viewers—and there are three billion of you watching this livestream right now, so there've got to be some real good thinkers in there—may have noticed that a new app has been installed on all of your mobile devices. The Bottom-Up Policy Tree."

Onson Sweemey paled on camera stream four. "You madman. You can't possibly be suggesting—"

"For the past century and a half, the individuals you see here have decided the course of the world," Ada said. "We will suffer this no longer. Every human on Earth will be given one vote, which they can use to endorse their own proposal, or boost someone else's. *Do* try not to cheat; we've been planning this for the past thirty years, and I assure you, anything you can think of in the next seventy-two hours, we already have. When the time is up... well. Your fate will be decided." 

"You who would leave humanity to burn while you lived out the rest of your miserable lives, I put you on trial. A trial of ten billion jurors, united in deciding your fate. I would wish you luck, but it's just one of the many, many resources you've exhausted on this planet."

And with that, Ada leaned back in her chair, interlacing her fingers as she watched votes begin to roll in.
