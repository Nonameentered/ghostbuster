**Time was subjective.** It flew when you were having fun, floundered when you were bored and alone, and moved in loops and spirals when you dreamed at night. Shivio had spent weeks that passed like heartbeats lost in conversation with the human girl who'd saved his life during the Silent Crusade, laughing with her, staying by her side, protecting her from those who would do her wrong.

And until now, his magics of light and flame were enough. He had fought necromancers and genies and soldiers alike, slaying them with elfin grace and power.

But even as the heartbeats trickled past, there was one foe he never managed to strike back at. Shivio had been born and raised in a predominantly-human society, and he knew the ravages of age as they clawed at Kailenn's body. How her eyes receded and dimmed, her hands grew gnarled and wrinkled, her smile falling gap-toothed and stiff.

And so it fell to him to save Kailenn from one last foe: time itself.

He'd wanted to take Kailenn with him, of course. He knew very well the great tragedies of the timeless speciesâ€”if she were to fall, it would be by his side. And so they'd adventured as they had in Kailenn's youth. He'd sought a grand gate between planes, stepped into the Plane of Elemental History, and journeyed across a landscape of time that compressed and stretched. It was a journey fit for an adventurer of Shivio's caliber.

Kailenn even kept up, at first.

But year by year, her body failed her. The steps that had once been surefooted and bold gave way to twisted ankles and pained cries; the hikes that were trivial in her youth became insurmountable obstacles in her old age. Finally, when they were at the doorstep of their goal, Kailenn's body gave out, and she fell to the floor with a rueful laugh.

"Shivio," she whispered, and the spark in her eyes had never quite died over the years. "It's okay. Just... sit with me. For however longer I have left. If these are our last hours together... I want to spend them in peace. With you."

Shivio swallowed, torn between leaving in search of immortality, or spending the last sparks of mortal life by his love's side.

Then he knelt, folding his ankles beneath him, and pressed one hand to her cheek. "Okay," he whispered. "If that's what you want. Okay."

And they sat side-by-side in the roiling, twisting landscape. Shivio leaned his head on her shoulder, and Kailenn grasped his hand in hers.

And time slowed down.

Time was subjective. To Shivio, the last few hours before Kailenn's soul shattered were an eternity. Every word she said, every laugh she made, they reverberated in Shivio's heart for longer than his entire life so far, and some part of him knew he would always be here, at the heart of an immortal moment with a mortal, frail woman.

Then infinity fell into a grain of sand, and eternity passed in an hour.

Kailenn squeezed his hand, one last time, and closed her eyes.

By the time Shivio's eyes opened, she was nothing but dust. Decades, perhaps centuries had passed while he knelt there in mourning.

Then, standing up, he turned and stepped away from the final resting place of Kailenn.

But some part of him knew that he would never truly leave.
