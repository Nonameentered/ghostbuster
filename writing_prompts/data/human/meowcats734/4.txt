**"So, hot stuff, what's underneath the helmet?"** Kriya slurred, one drunken hand scrabbling at Meloai's head.

"A gorget, mostly," Meloai calmly replied, "with some padding and chain mail."

Despite the din of the tavern, Meloai's words were crisp and clear. Kriya frowned, making a frustrated gesture. "No, I mean—"

"I know what you mean. I simply choose to ignore it." Meloai turned to leave, but her unwieldy form was clunkier than the body she was used to, and Kriya managed to slip between Meloai and the door. 

"Seriously, seriously, I mean—you're the hottest rising star in the adventuring scene," Kriya hurried out. "Come on. Don't you want to let me have... just a peek?"

Meloai placed one palm on Kriya's chest and *pushed*—not with her armored gauntlet of a hand, but with her soul. Kriya jerked upright in shock as the confusion and arousal and arrogance were ejected from her soul, leaving nothing but surprise and a hint of sudden fear.

"I said *no,*" Meloai repeated.

Kriya's expression darkened. "What, you think you're so much better than the rest of us adventurers? Not even willing to show your face?"

For a moment, Meloai considered casting some kind of illusion of a human form beneath her armor—but she discarded the notion for the same reason she'd chosen this form in the first place. She didn't want to *have* to pretend to be human just to fit in. The armor was a compromise, to let her blend into society without reshaping her body entirely to humanity's whims. She was willing to compromise no further.

"I am neither intrinsically better nor worse than any other soul who walks this world," Meloai calmly said. "What I *am* is a highly competent adventurer and soulmage. For your own sake, I recommend you stop trying to antagonize me."

Kriya balled her fists, stepping towards Meloai. "Is that a threat?"

Internally, Meloai sighed. She missed her friends—it was so much easier to deal with people she understood. She was regretting entering this damnable tavern to begin with—the so-called teammates she was supposed to be celebrating with had abandoned her the first moment they could, and she'd been left awkwardly standing in the corner with a drink in her hand she couldn't consume. 

Meloai sized up Kriya, the drunken confidence overflowing from her soul, and said, "How about this. You want to take my helmet off so badly? Meet me out back and I'll show you."

Kriya grinned fiercely. "*That's* what I'm talking about. *Whoo!*" The woman jogged off, tossing down the contents of the mug in her hands in celebration.

Meloai rubbed her forehead, then clanked over to a corner. Meloai had no intention of meeting Kriya out back, but by the time Kriya realized that, she'd be in no shape to find Meloai. When she was certain nobody was looking, she concentrated, reshaping her soul and shifting into the form of one of the dingy wooden chairs littered around the bar.

Meloai watched from the corner as the party raged on long into the night—at one point, Kriya stormed back in, demanding to know where Meloai was, and had to be escorted out when nobody could find her. That, at least, provided a spot of amusement for Meloai as the rest of the revelers finally passed out or went home.

It was hard to hide in human society, and some days, Meloai wondered if it was worth it. But as Meloai cautiously shifted back into her armored form, she could say this much: at least it was never boring.
