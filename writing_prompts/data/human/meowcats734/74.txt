**"It's called a verevolf,"** Dr. Fenn said. "Half werewolf, half vampire."

"Whose idea was *that* naming convention?" Chantel grumbled, kicking at all six of his ears with one hind leg. Being simultaneously burdened with a set of human, bat, and wolf ears wasn't quite the *worst* thing that'd ever happened to him, but it was pretty up there. 

"Actually, that would be me." The other verevolf in the room raised a winged, pawed hand. "Congrats—you're the first person in a decade to fuck yourself up *this* badly."

"Well, hey, now, surely there are benefits?" I complained. "I mean—werewolves have super-hearing, and so do vampires. Don't they, like, stack?"

"Oh, they do," the verevolf grumbled. "They do. You just haven't noticed yet. Here, do me a solid. Blow on this?" They handed Chantel a dull whistle.

"Gin, play nice," Dr. Fenn said, scolding the verevolf. 

Gin shrugged unrepentantly. "He wanted to find out what happens. Go on, give it a try."

Hesitantly, I lifted the whistle to my mouth and bl—

The next thing I remembered, I was lying on the floor, all six ears bleeding. Gin was doing the same, but he gave me a humorless grin as he did so.

"Wait until you realize that's an ordinary dog whistle," he said. "Try living near a city with a hundred of those bouncing around."

"Ugh, *fuck* that. I almost wish I'd gotten bitten by a zombie, instead. I don't think they even *have* ears."

A moment passed in which I had an awful, brilliant idea.

"In fact..." I stood up, frowning. "Hey. Do you know anything about what happens if you get bitten by a vampire, a werewolf, *and* a zombie?"

"No. *Absolutely* not," Dr. Fenn said, standing between us. "You have no idea what the possible consequences are—"

"I'm in," Gin said, pushing aside the doctor with ease. Hey, there *were* some benefits to the hybridization. "If I never have to hear that awful pitch again, it'll be a day too soon."

"Perfect." I grinned, turning to Dr. Fenn, and it occurred to me by his pale face that I had *way* too many teeth as of now. "Now, good doctor, I don't suppose you could direct me towards a zombie?"
