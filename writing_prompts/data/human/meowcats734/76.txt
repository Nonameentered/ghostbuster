**"Nobody ever reads the rules,"** Hashmellan grumbled, folding their ethereal arms as they glared at the paladin. "Look, I'll give you this one for free. Wish for a one-meter radius sphere of gold to materialize at my coordinates, displacing the matter which previously occupied it, and retire to a life of luxury. Last guy who did that bought herself an island chain off the Crystal Coast."

"I am a paladin, Hashmellan. This is far from the longest text I have read in service of the light, and certainly not the most obtuse. Book of Ashlight, 12:8. 'Thou shalt read the texts of your elders, and learn from them, and study them without question.'" Shivio delicately turned the four hundred and thirty-second page of the rulebook. "Kailenn, do you know what 'demurrer' means?"

Hashmellan groaned as Shivio turned to his travelling companion. "Look, do you want to know what 'demurrer' means? That can be your wish, okay? Can you just finish this so I can go back to the Plane of Desire?"

"I think it was in the glossary," Kaillenn mumbled, pointing at the back. The small, frail girl gave the genie a nervous look. "Shivio, are you sure you want to make them angry? Of *all* the soulspace entities you could antagonize, a genie is probably one of the worst."

"Rulebook 203:6. 'Unless the previous clauses' definitions of the initiation of a verbal deal have been initiated, exertion of power on realspace will be limited to sensory simulations within the normal range of the contacting species in question, as defined in Subsection F.'" Shivio recited without looking up from the book. "Also, if Hashmellan was capable of smiting me, they would have done so already."

"True. True. Very true. Hey, you know what? You. Witch." Kailenn jerked up as Hashmellan pointed one slender finger at the girl. "What are you even doing with a paladin of the Silent Crusade? I bet he's going to decapitate you as soon as you're no longer useful to him. Paladins are jerks like that. Why don't you assassinate him from behind, take my soul vessel from his corpse, and actually *make a damn wish so I can leave.*"

"Er, uh, no thanks," Kailenn said. "I... kinda saved his life? He... he *was* all head-choppy before, but now he's nice to me. And he doesn't get as mad that I've never read the Book of Ashlight." Upon seeing the genie's disappointed expression, Kailenn wilted. "Sorry. I know you really wanted me to betray him."

"Nah, nah, I can't even stay mad at those puppy-dog eyes," Hashmellan grumbled.

"Really, they can't," Shivio said, flipping to the next page. "Long-term memories, aside from those directly pertaining to past holders of the soul vessel, must be consumed upon exit from realspace."

"Look, I'm not omniscient, but I can see everything you can. You're on the last page. Are we done here, or are you going to start writing a contract of your own? Because believe me, the *last* person who did that? She didn't get what she wanted."

"Mm. No, I never was one for writing. I always did believe that the elders had written everything worth reading. Until... well. Until Kailenn." Shivio delicately shut the rulebook, then handed it back to Hashmellan. It dissolved in a puff of smoke. "I have my wish."

"Hoo boy. Drumroll, please." Hashmellan held out their hands, conjuring up a *badumbadumbadumbadumbadum* with their lips. "And your wish is...?"

"That you are now and forevermore a virtuous and philanthropic being, who will willingly use their powers to benefit all that is good," Shivio placidly said.

Hashmellan hesitated.

"Those... I am contractually obliged to inform you that those terms are not rigorously defined in any of the four hundred and ten pages of contract that you just read."

"Wait, didn't you read four hundred and thirty-four?" Kailenn whispered.

"Twenty-two of them were options to get offered a translation in varying languages, one was the title page, and one was intentionally left blank," Shivio whispered back. Raising his voice, he said, "That is correct. As per the standard contract, you will be free to interpret what 'virtue' and 'good' are, of your own will and knowledge."

Hashmellan stared at Shivio.

Then, slowly, creasing their brows, they asked, "...why?"

Shivio pressed his lips together.

Then he turned to Kailenn. "Book of Ashlight, 9:12. 'Let no fell witch roam draw breath from the same air as you; hang them from banisters and rafters and lamp-posts and trees.'"

Kailenn shuddered. "I'm really happy that there aren't any lamp-posts or trees in the plains. Also, why those four specific things?"

"I am more worried about the hanged than what they are hung *from,*" Shivio whispered. "All my life, I followed the tenets of my holy books, even when they were cruel and wicked and *wrong*. Until I met someone who taught me to think of good and virtue in my own terms, instead of how they were branded into my skin." He nodded towards Kailenn, who had fallen silent. "I wish to do the same for you. I... apologize for how long it took. I had to make sure that none of those terms would still fall within the province of the laws you were assigned."

Hashmellan narrowed their eyes.

Then a quiet, cruel smile began to creep across their face.

"You *imbecile.*" The single word rattled the foundations of the stone ruins they stood in. "Those rules were there to *protect* you and your world. You want to know what I consider *good*? What I consider *virtuous*? I am afraid that my conceptions of the words are very, *very* different from what a mortal such as you might hold."

"That, too, is your right," Shivio whispered. "We all have different notions of good. If you choose to take my gift and throw it away, that is your right as well."

"Oh, it is *very* much in my rights to wipe your parasitic mess of a species off the face of these plains before your technologies and magics ruin the adjacent planes beyond repair. It is now, thanks to *you*." The genie's form *twisted* in strange dimensions, as if it was a knife piercing the sheet of paper that was the world. Shivio channeled his soul into the memory of a sword, and a deadly shaft of light coalesced into the shape of a blade. "And the first two souls I will devour are *yours*."

"I have my notions of good and virtue, too. I had hoped yours would reconcile with mine. I beg you to reconsider," Shivio said, squaring his stance as Kailenn scuttled behind him.

"Then *beg*." The genie straightened to their full height, strange magics flickering in the air.

And paladin met genie in a clash of powers, lighting up the plains as far as the eye could see.
