Thanks for the critique! Fun factâ€”Shivio's backstory is explored in an earlier story [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/v5rl3w/wp_after_losing_their_home_a_young_necromancer/), and [later episodes of Soulmage](https://www.reddit.com/r/bubblewriters/comments/uxmwe4/soulmage_masterpost/?sort=new) will explore their future.
