Ooh, this looks fun! I typically write the vast majority of my stories in a single connected serial anyway, so aiming for placesetting sounds funâ€”but that being said, I was told that I had to occasionally write stories that *aren't* connected to each other, so I'm not sure if I can actually complete it.
