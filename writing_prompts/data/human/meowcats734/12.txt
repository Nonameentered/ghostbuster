**"Back already?"** the Angel asked, polishing their fingernails. "Was this life a speedrun?"

"Oh, shut up," I snapped. "What the hell did I even die to?"

"Same assassin as last time," the Angel said, shrugging. "You're not as clever as you think, changing how you physically appear between lives. The same people you pissed off last life are intent on earning you those Frequent Dying Miles this time around."

"Right." I tried to rub my forehead, remembered that I was nothing but a disembodied soul here, and settled for flicking my attention between the three options before me. 

The Angel's eyebrow raised as I looked at the "Cheat Menu" option. "Are you interested in making a—"

"*No*, I'm not fucking over a piece of my immortal soul just to make my next life marginally easier. I'm lucky enough to have an infinite number of tries to stop the mortals from tearing themselves apart in this war. I'll get there eventually." I focused on my old lives, considering which form to load my soul into. I'd hoped that a child's innocence with an immortal's ageless wisdom would make a halfway-decent spy, but it seemed like any kind of stealth measures were out of the window now that both sides could tell when I arrived on the battlefield. 

Fine. I'd just have to try something new.

I focused my intent, and the Angel sighed. "A new life? Well, I suppose I can't stop you. Do you want to customize the body yourself, or—"

"Surprise me," I muttered.

The Angel smirked. "Very well. Enjoy your stay on the mortal realm."

The void around me shrunk into nothing as my soul reached across planes to the other side—

I jolted awake, licking my lips, then looked down at my hooves. My four, caprine hooves. Questingly, I opened my mouth and let out a *baaa*. Great. Just great. Well, I had asked to be surprised. 

I trotted off into the distance, where a war I could never stop raged. 

I supposed it was time to play goat simulator.
