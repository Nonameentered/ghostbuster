Thanks for the critique! I’m a little confused by what you mean—the phrase “however, you’d be surprised how many vampires are just” doesn’t show up anywhere in the story, and I can’t realistically see where that idea comes into play. This also isn’t part of a novel, and I’m not sure what you mean by requesting that I keep in mind that I’m writing one; I do write novels and web serials, but this piece is not connected to either.

In terms of character development, I totally agree that the characters pretty much aren’t, other than some basic traits like Gin being a prankster, Dr. Fenn being cautious, and the main character (who I for some reason switched between third and first person for) being reckless. These characters definitely aren’t as strong as some of my other pieces, but this was never intended to be a character-focused piece, and I’m content to channel those energies towards my longer works.
