**"You ever heard of the birthday paradox?"** Sansen asked us, as our group of four trekked across the icy wastelands. The desolate wastes out here were devoid of nearly all life—but we'd come out here for a reason.

"The numbers game?" Meloai asked. "Like, if you have... twenty? Twenty or so people in a room, then odds are, two of them have the same birthday?"

Sansen frowned. "What? No, that's not what I'm talking about. That's not even a paradox—that's just a weird math fact. I'm talking about that time six billion people got together to throw the largest birthday party in all of time and space, causing a temporal paradox that subsequently erased the event from existence."

I gave Sansen an incredulous stare.

"No," I finally said. "No, Sansen, we have *not* heard of the birthday paradox," I finally said.

"Also, if it was a paradox and never happened, how did *you* hear about it?" Meloai asked?

Sansen shook his head. The old man was surprisingly talkative—I guess being so near our goal was cheering him up. Even the unending hail and sleet couldn't bog down his spirit. "That's for me to know and you to wonder," he said. "No, I just bring it up because... well. My husband and I. We share a birthday."

I nodded. Uncle Sansen and Uncle Jiaola had only celebrated their dual birthday together once, before they were separated by the war.

And the four of us—all sharing a common birthday—had banded together and trekked across the world to bring him back.

"It's coming up in two weeks," Sansen said, his good cheer fading. "I want him to be there for it."

"We'll find him," I said, giving the old man a smile. "And we'll get out of here and throw the best damn birthday party ever."

Sansen grinned. "Yeah. Yeah, we'll find him. Happy early birthday, kid."

"Happy early birthday to you."

We slogged onwards in the snow, hoping our party of four would become five before it was too late.

A.N.

I've been having some pretty irritating writer's block as of late. I find it immensely amusing that this prompt is the one that shocked me out of it. Thanks for the prompt.
