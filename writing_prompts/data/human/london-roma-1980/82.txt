Nine times out of ten, these guys know that they gotta keep the distance.  Two folks dressed like us could be an ambush waiting to happen.  But I've done this show so often, I knew distance from just hearing it.  Like they say about them bats in the chapel, you know?  So I knew he was speeding up, almost trying to take the lead on me.

He was half-distance away when we reached a blind turn in the maze of alleys I had him go through.  I held out my hand to the side, that known sign of "stay back, I'm checking the corner".  A quick peek revealed that the meetup was six blocks down the road, dead straight, although well hidden from any strays.

But he was even closer.

I emphatically pointed behind me, thinking he would spoil the act if he didn't play his part.  But when the footsteps grew louder and closer, I knew it was red alert time.  I ducked around the corner, ready to confront him when he followed, but the first thing around was a hand in a glove, holding the business end of a Beretta.  

I was too slow to think of ducking and took a pistol whip right between the eyes.  It was enough to disorient me so much I never saw the brass knux heading straight for my dome.  A direct hit rattled me so bad you could see the stars around my head as far away as the docks.  I was too groggy to resist as my adversary dragged me aside.

Somewhere in the distance, at the spot of the meetup, I did hear those two words that gave me a little hope there's a happy ending: "Officer down!"
