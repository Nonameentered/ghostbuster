The picture took forever to load, but Naomi and Tim passed the time with their ice cream and conversation.  Granted, Tim was feeling very awkward about his part of it, between Naomi's all-too-sharp memory and a machine that didn't seem to care about the timeline.

"Oh, it's ready!"  Naomi looked at the camera, but her face turned from excitement to shock and anger.  "...is this a prank?  What kind of stupid picture is this?  I gotta go."

"Naomi!  Wait!"  Tim grabbed the camera without even looking into the frame and chased after her.  Naomi was storming off quickly, trying to keep a distance between the two of them.  Tim finally caught up at the entrance.  "What's wrong?  I didn't--"

"Get away from me," Naomi demanded as she walked through, head down and marching to the exit.  Tim followed, speechless, but soon noticed a bigger deal: a car rounding the corner at high speed.  If he didn't do something, he was going to witness a collision.

Reacting as quickly as he could, he reached out for Naomi.  All he could get was a handful of her long hair, but it was enough to keep her from hopping off the curb and into the path of the oncoming speed demon!  Naomi screamed in pain, but as soon as she saw the car zoom through where she would have been, she was shocked.

"T-tim... you saved my life?"

"Did I?"

"I think so," Naomi said breathlessly.  "I didn't know."

"Know what?"

"Why the picture showed you pulling on my hair."
