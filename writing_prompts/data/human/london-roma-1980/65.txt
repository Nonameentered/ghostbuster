CRYSTAL-2: "Never?  Never??  H-how?  Did you not have the virus?"

ANDY-1: "What, Covid?"

ANDY-2: "Not quite.  This was far worse."

CRYSTAL-2: "And the... the murder at NATO?"

ANDY-1: "The what?"

CRYSTAL-2: "C'mon, this all just happened!  The war wasn't that long ago!"

ANDY-2: "Crystal... calm down.  Our worlds are not the same.  Not even close.  And on top of that... whoever told you the war was over lied.  But I guess it's over for us... we can't go back."

CRYSTAL-2: "They said we can't?"

ANDY-2: "More like we shouldn't, even if we could."

CRYSTAL-2: "...I... but... they... it... where am I?"

CRYSTAL-1: "I got this.  So we had a virus a couple years ago, but it just kinda happened.  And it was bad but not that bad.  Like, we had to spend a couple years with masks on and travel was shut down a lot, but they found a cure for it and then got a vaccine too!  We're getting back to normal!"

CRYSTAL-2: "But wouldn't Boris and Trump use this to..."

ANDY-1: "They're not in power anymore."

CRYSTAL-2: "But how...?  I'm so lost."

*The two Andys look at each other.*

ANDY-2: "Teaching moment?"

ANDY-1: "Teaching moment.  And probably for me, too.  What hell did you come from?"

ANDY-2: "It's a long story."

CRYSTAL-2: "Okay, so the virus didn't start a war?  And nobody tried to take over?"

ANDY-1: "No, actually.  I mean, Russia **is** trying to get into Ukraine, but that's really not going well for him."

ANDY-2: "And all the countries really worked together for you.  Which isn't what happened here.  We essentially live in the middle of a [game of Risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game))."

ANDY-1: "...you got a map?  That might help me and Crystal here."

ANDY-2: "Give me a blank one of Earth and I'll get on it."

ANDY-1: "Right."

CRYSTAL-2: "Must be nice to live in a normal world.  You don't have to worry about your kids at school or some people mocking you for your love life."

CRYSTAL-1: "My love life?  How?  Are you... do your neighbors watch you or something??"

CRYSTAL-2: "What? No!  It's just that people... well, my neighbors always thought I was weird for marrying an American.  Wasn't anything serious, but, you know -- people always think you'll meet someone you live near as opposed to some guy who falls in your lap on the Internet."

CRYSTAL-1: "You must have been so happy when he got the Embassy job."

CRYSTAL-2: "It was wonderful!  He was suddenly nearby every day, and we could spend time together, and soon we moved in and... it all just fell into place!  Although I couldn't exactly surprise him at work any.  Security and all."

ANDY-2: "Not that it stopped you."

CRYSTAL-2: "Oh let it go!  Ugh... you get arrested ONE time..."

ANDY-1: "She got arrested too?"

ANDY-2: "More like detained.  She got a few friends at the Embassy to sneak her in through a first floor window and race up the stairs.  As you can imagine, that didn't go over well."

ANDY-1: "Well, there's your lesson, dear.  No breaking and entering."

CRYSTAL-1: "Obviously."

*The two Andys study the map.*

ANDY-1: "Hm.  So it looks like you won the little Brexit argument pretty handily."

ANDY-2: "Don't take it so lightly.  The government's pretty powerful.  If you get on their bad side, they can ruin you in a heartbeat."

ANDY-1: "Well, you're IN the government, aren't you?"

ANDY-2: "...for now.  It's not gonna last."

CRYSTAL-2: "...what's wrong, dear?"

ANDY-2: "The ANZUS Annexation.  Britain is building up for retribution.  Even if I stayed, I'm certain the embassy would be shut down.  I'd be out of a job, and with tensions being what they are, I doubt I could find work.  And that's if we'd never left.  Now..."

ANDY-1: "Well, now you're safe here until it all blows over.  We've already claimed there's a Covid scare in the neighborhood - that gives us another week or so to figure out something."

ANDY-2: "It'll never blow over.  Crystal... I'm sorry."

*Andy-2, again, tries to stifle tears as Crystal-2 approaches him in confusion.*

CRYSTAL-2: "What's wrong?"

CRYSTAL-1: "They want him dead."

CRYSTAL-2: "For what?"

CRYSTAL-1: "For kidnapping.  You."
