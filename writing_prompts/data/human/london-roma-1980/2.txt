I wasn't that bothered by the (implied) subject matter.  I was too busy being entertained by the dad's excitement over cooking!

I would be careful, though, with punctuation at the end of the quote.  You aren't consistent with it.  One time there's no punctuation (Right between the eyes" he said as he), then there's a period and new sentence (here.  Go one now."  He said as).  When ending the quote on a full sentence, it's proper to use a comma and continue from there (here.  Go on now," he said as).  The exception is if you're using a non-period to end the quote, which you correctly do (afraid to use salt!" he said as).  But even then, the "He said" is part of the sentence, as the quote is the object of the word "said".

Good job here with this!  I could hear the dad's voice, which carried the piece!
