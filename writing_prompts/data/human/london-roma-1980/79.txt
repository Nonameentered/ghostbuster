(PART 3)

Jenny's stepmother stood in front of us, looking very different from what I had seen when I met her at the door.  She had metallic gloves on and a flowing purple robe.  Her shoes, also purple, seemed to almost float off the floor.  I knew, without needing any introduction, that this was the outfit of a dark mage.

"So," she said, looking back and forth at us as we sat unable and/or unwilling to move.  "I told my daughter that dating was going to ruin her life.  She was given a strict curfew, and she was told to obey it.  I value obedience out of children..."  I was too scared to say that at 17, we were not children anymore.  "...and I do not have it.  Clearly, my daughter and her friend have conspired to fail me.  There are consequences."

I felt the protest within me, and somehow I knew I couldn't get in more trouble, so I spoke up.  "Ma'am, I've never met you before and this was all just a mistake.  I'm sure that..."

"You are to be silent!"  That stopped me from having any initiative.  "If I had not come down, how far would you have gone in defiling her?  The process had begun.  You will face consequences.  But first... Jennifer, you are to go into that room," she said, pointing at the closed door.

"Yes, mother," Jenny replied, calmly and obediently walking to the door.  She opened it, and inside I thought I saw some sort of medieval device.  I couldn't figure out what it was before the door closed again.  The stepmother had me alone now.

"You, boy," she barked.  "You are to wait where you are and not move.  When I need you, I will let you know.  In the meantime, you are to consider what you've done."  With that, the stepmother entered the room and closed the door behind her.

What had I done?  I had simply asked a popular girl at school on a date.  I had noticed she didn't seem to be interested in the athletes and wondered why.  When she said that she wanted someone who would respect her boundaries, I thought she meant that the jocks were trying to get in her pants.

But she seemed to like me enough to... no, it was just first base, don't think like that.  There's no telling how far the alone time would have gone.  What matters is what the real boundaries were; they weren't hers, they were her stepmother's.  Those boundaries must have been placed upon her from childhood, or whenever this stepmother entered her life.  She was being programmed to be the perfect daughter... and because of 15 minutes, she would be...

What *was* about to happen, anyway?  That device -- what was it going to do?  Was she going to be hurt?  Abused?  Killed?  Lobotomized?  I saw the round device like something out of a steampunk horror novel, perfectly sized to go on someone's head.  I didn't know what it was, and I couldn't make out the words the stepmother was using back there... but I began to fear it more than anything else.

After what felt like an interminable time, the door re-opened.  Jenny emerged, walking carelessly past me and up the stairs.  I waved to her, but my new girlfriend didn't even acknowledge me.  She must have been told she was to go straight to her room.  She was probably grounded.  I guess I'd find out on Monday.

"Boy, you are to come into this room."

If not sooner.
