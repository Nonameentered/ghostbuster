<3/3>

They don't warn you about days like today, when you have to face the people you're milking.  I was usually reminded the big speech about dots on the ground -- that's what they were to us.  Just marks and mooks to make a buck from.  But now...

...I stared at the babe.  Stared hard as I let the gal know I was thinking.  This drug that Big Boss was smuggling in, keepin' the suits in the Feds from making available, was supposed to be just a way to be rich and get out.  But when you stare into the face of a dying kid and it smacks you in the face like a ton of bricks what you're doing, you begin to wonder why you do this.

After what felt like longer than it takes for the Cubs to win the World Series, I finally spoke.  "For you, lady -- half off."

I watched the lady -- the girl, no more than 20 -- give some of the drug to her poor sister.  While I knew I had done some good to save a life, had I just traded hers for mine?  I dreaded the meeting back at the boss's place.  All he cared about was cash, and I had less of it.  Part of me wanted to run; part of me wanted to beat them to it and blow my own brains out.

As I slumped down, I noticed the light shining on the girl at the corner.  In a small moment, with my eyes squinting from the light rain, it looked like she'd been an angel.  Maybe an angel was the answer.  I clutched my own piece, stared in the direction of the boss's joint, and for the first time in my life, prayed as I walked towards the reckoning.
