Riven dropped Ashleigh off at the portal.  Ashleigh steadied herself as she stood in front of it.  Three years with humans, three years of studying for the trials, and it would all come down to this.  With a deep breath, she stepped in to meet her assessor.

"And how has your sabbatical among the humans been?" asked the anonymous grader, his judging eyes peering from beneath his horns.

"I dunno," Ashleigh shrugged.  "I mean, they are what you said -- a mix of intentions."

"And it's our job to bring them to us.  Let's see you do it.  First trial -- provide temptation to cause chaos."

Ashleigh looked in the crystal ball and saw her landlord's address.  She knew what to do.  Concentrating, she slowly raised her arms as a huge pile of cash appeared on the doorstep.  She put a note on it.  Rent paid with interest, plus a windfall off the books -- the perfect temptation.

"Unorthodox," the judge nodded, "but successful.  Next trial.  Thwart a good deed to provide despair."

Ashleigh again dialed into the crystal ball.  She saw Riven cornering a couple and demanding their money.  A good Samaritan was around the corner.  With a snap, she raised a brick in the alleyway, tripping the would-be white knight and allowing Riven to escape with ill-gotten gains.  The couple were despondent -- and the man of the couple glared at the Samaritan.

"Excellent.  You are almost ready to join our horde," the grader noted.  "One final test."

The crystal ball showed a girl walking down the street.  Ashleigh immediately recognized her -- it was Sarah, the one friend she had had who wanted to keep her from being an outsider!  Ashleigh felt something well up inside her as she heard the assignment.

"Destroy her and harvest her soul for us."
