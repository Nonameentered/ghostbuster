ACT IV: WORLDS COLLIDE

*Scene: video conference, with all four civilians and Dr. Stone-1.*

STONE-1: "So, what it boils down to is that we need the four of you here.  Our group wants to make sure that the change in settings hasn't led to a change in physical difficulties."

ANDY-1: "...well, emotionally we've been through a lot, but he still seems to be like me."

STONE-1: "Appearances can be deceiving.  After all, many people have unknown defects, and something that may be normal on their world could cause sudden death in ours."

CRYSTAL-1: "Like what?"

STONE-1: "A change in atmospheric pressure could lead to hypertension.  Additives in food may lead to cholesterol intake."

CRYSTAL-2: "And that's why I don't eat pizza."

CRYSTAL-1: "You'll be fine."

STONE-1: "That's what we hope to determine."

ANDY-1: "And I suppose you need us to be the control group."

STONE-1: "That is the idea.  The two universes we are from, though socially disparate, appear to have divided only a few years ago.  That would most people in both worlds have been similar for a while.  Hopefully, that is the conclusion we reach."

CRYSTAL-1: "Works for me."

STONE-1: "Good.  Now, for security reasons, the two pairs will have to leave separately.  Fortunately, London has two international airports that service Copenhagen.  Team 1, you'll be leaving from Heathrow; Team 2, from Gatwick."

ANDY-2: "We're teams now?"

ANDY-1: "We're making this up as we go along.  Just run with it."

CRYSTAL-1: "What day do you want us to book?"

STONE-1: "We'll cover that.  All information will be relayed to you as we get it.  We're aiming for three days from now.  It will not be a long stay."

ANDY-1: "Well, let's get packing."

CRYSTAL-1: "Sure."

STONE-1: "Um, couple #2, if you could stick around; I do have extra concerns."

ANDY-2: "Go ahead."

*Couple 1 head off.*

STONE-1: "I'm sure you two have talked about a desire to return home."

CRYSTAL-2: "...I've told him I don't see any other way.  Being a stranger like this... it just feels like we're a burden on this world.  I want my life back."

STONE-1: "Are you both in agreement?"

ANDY-2: "...I don't know.  I don't think that it will work.  I'm afraid to die."

CRYSTAL-2: "Which would you rather do, see your kids one time or never again?  They must be worried sick!  The sooner we get back, the better!"

STONE-1: "Well, don't be so hasty, Crystal.  Remember, there's still the matter that travel is not automatic from our universe.  There are still logistics we'd have to work out.  I hope to have the details prepared by the time you are here."

ANDY-2: "Do you think this will help our kids live a better life?"

STONE-1: "I have no news on them right now.  If anti-American sentiment is as high as my counterpart has led me to believe, it is entirely possible.  I cannot ask you to do this.  You have to make this decision."

CRYSTAL-2: "Please?"

ANDY-2: "...when I married you, I told the world I would live for you and I would die for you.  I guess now, I will prove it."

STONE-1: "Does this mean you will return with her?"

ANDY-2: "l... all right."

STONE-1: "Then I will make sure all of you arrive here.  Thank you."

*The conference ends.  Stone-1 flips a channel on the communicator.*

STONE-1: "Stone, come in.  Stone, come in."

STONE-2: "Yes.  You have news on the criminal?"

STONE-1: "He will be in our vicinity as soon as the transporter is ready.  As long as you open the portal, they will walk through."

STONE-2: "...I knew I could count on you.  You will be happily rewarded."

STONE-1: "I am sure I will."

STONE-2: "The reward I receive for this will be shared -- and do not worry; you are the only person I'm sharing it with.  This operation is a secret.  You are to keep everyone from knowing."

STONE-1: "It's done.  We will remain in touch.  Over and Out."

STONE-2: "God Save the Leader."

*Communication ends.*

STONE-1: "I'd better see how construction is going..."
