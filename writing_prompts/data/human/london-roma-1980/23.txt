I liked the characterization of how far Irene had fallen here.  The description of the eyes was magnificent in using a small number of words to describe rock bottom.  A great start!

As meta-crit, I would say this tried to do too much.  The last paragraph seems a bit much.  You don't need to spell it out.  The idea that courage isn't just acting boldly, but acting against the grain, is already established in Cassie's prior statement.  This feels like doubling down where doubling down isn't necessary.

Obviously, 500 words is too short to do the whole reconciliation justice, so I'm not holding that against you.  You did a great start on this!  I think this story could easily be expanded with more dialogue, more description, and more background.  There's a summary of a great story here -- and it's a great summary!  You did really well in the constrictions, don't get me wrong!

But please, expand this story to something bigger.  I want to read more.
