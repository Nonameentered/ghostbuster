ACT I: FIRST CONTACT

*Scene: outside a house.  A car pulls up and parks in the driveway, just outside the garage.  A man and woman get out, walking arm in arm to the door.  His name is Andy, hers is Crystal.*

CRYSTAL: "Ah, a weekend alone."

ANDY: "Hey, we've earned.  It was so nice of your family to look after the kids."

CRYSTAL: "Oh, you know Mom enjoys it.  Besides, it's been so many hectic years we've practically earned a little time off."

ANDY: "Yeah... it'll be just like the first years."

CRYSTAL: "You needn't sound so nostalgic.  The kids are wonderful."

ANDY: "I know, but sometimes... you gotta get away."

CRYSTAL: "In this case, you gotta not get away."

*She giggles, then puts her key in the lock... only to hear the sound of a key falling out from behind the door.*

ANDY: "What's wrong?"

CRYSTAL: "I think someone's inside."

ANDY: "I got this."  *He shouts through the door.*  "Who's there?"

VOICE FROM INSIDE: "Just a minute!"

*Andy and Crystal share a surprised look.  Crystal mouths 'did that sound like me' to Andy, who shrugs in confusion.  Eventually, the door opens, and on the other side are...*

***Note from the fourth wall: for the sake of trying our best to avoid confusion, Andy-1 and Crystal-1 will be the couple coming home, and Andy-2 and Crystal-2 are the couple they see inside.***

*After a full minute of stunned silence...*

ANDY-1: "Who are you?"

ANDY-2: "Me?  Who are you?"

ANDY-1: "I live here."

ANDY-2: "I live here!"

ANDY-1: "I have a key!"

ANDY-2: "You mean this key?"  *He picks the key up that had fallen out of the lock.*

CRYSTAL-1: "Oh, enough of this!"  *She barges past Couple #2 and into the house.*

CRYSTAL-2: "Hey!  Get out, creep!"

CRYSTAL-1: "What did you call me?"

ANDY-2: "Honey, calm down, this isn't helping!  Ahem... I guess we'd better sit down and work something out."

ANDY-1: "This makes no sense."

CRYSTAL-2: "There's no way you live here.  I don't know where you got those disguises, but this is our house.  We've lived here for years!"

CRYSTAL-1: "That's impossible!  We just dropped our kids off with Grandma and came back."

ANDY-2: "Kids?  How old are they?"

ANDY-1: "Seven and three... why?"

CRYSTAL-2: "We have two kids that age... and they're with Grandma right now."

*An eerie silence sets in.*

CRYSTAL-2: "Wait... what's your National ID?"

ANDY-2: "What's your Social?"

*Couple 1 begin writing something down.  They hand it to their Couple 2 counterparts, who read it and go wide-eyed.*

CRYSTAL-2: "It's a match."

ANDY-2: "Same here."

CRYSTAL-1: "...but that means..."

CRYSTAL-2: "No way... I have a clone!?"

CRYSTAL-1: "I'm pretty sure I'm not a clone..."

ANDY-1: "Wait!  Do you remember that meteor that we saw on the freeway?  The one that nearly blinded us and stopped traffic for half an hour?"

BOTH CRYSTALS: "Yeah!"

ANDY-2: "Wait... you don't think that..."

ANDY-1: "It could have.  We need to talk to scientists.  With all the work being done on parallel universes... we should eliminate that possibility first."

\*\*\*\*\*

*Scene: a video conference with a leading astrophysicist, Dr. Hart.*

DR. HART: "Well, I'm glad you could contact me.  We noticed the so-called 'meteor' you spoke of.  It's an ultra-rare occurrence of multiversal intersect."

CRYSTAL-2: "Of what?"

DR. HART: "It's like this.  You know how we say parallel universes?  Well, most of the time, universes are parallel in the fifth dimension.  So while they exist, you'd never know about them.  However, if there's a disturbance of a great enough magnitude, universes can temporarily intersect."

ANDY-1: "How often are we talking about?"

DR. HART: "For any one universe, fairly common; but to intersect around Earth, usually no more than once year or so.  The good news is that most intersections don't let through that much-- this one appears to have been Class 1."

CRYSTAL-1: "Out of how much?"

DR. HART: "Well, let me put it this way: the last time we had a Class 10, the highest number, [a giant meteor wiped out half of Siberia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event)."

*A pause on the other end as our two couples try to imagine what else must have happened.*

DR. HART: "Fortunately, one like this is somewhat local.  Usually no more than a few people swapping universes around the world.  Actually, given our planet's high density, it's usually the case that we offload people rather than onload."

CRYSTAL-2: "That would explain [that one Parliament guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bingham,_7th_Earl_of_Lucan)."

DR. HART: "Potentially.  What's interesting is that we have gained this time.  That's very rare.  It means that the Earth our universe intersected with is either similar or potentially more dense.  Let me ask all of you -- men respond: how many billions of people live on earth?"

BOTH ANDYS: "Eight or so?"

DR. HART: "Okay, so there's a high probability your Earths are near-identical.  It's not nonsense; you get enough universes and, you know, some details will be the same.  It will make sorting things out as to who the visitors are much more difficult."

ANDY-2: "Great.  Two of us have abandoned our children!  Somebody here needs to get back!"

DR. HART: "I understand.  But to re-intersect universes can be very difficult.  For one thing, we need to figure out which one intersected.  Then, we'd need to bend space to cause an overlap.  This isn't something you can just do, as you can imagine.  And that's on top of trying to figure out who's who."

CRYSTAL-1: "Well... you work on the universe thing, and we'll try to work on the ID thing."

DR. HART: "If it helps, I'll recommend you to a fellow here at Bohr.  He has a background in psychology... he might be able to know how to tell which one is which.  Would that be okay?"

CRYSTAL-2: "When's he available?"

DR. HART: "Well, I can get him to speak to you tomorrow.  In the meantime, I'll work on the intersecting."

ANDY-1: "Thanks, Doc.  I know a few kids who will be very appreciative."

DR. HART: "Not a problem.  Talk to you soon."

*The conference ends.  The two couples all look at each other.*

CRYSTAL-1: "So... what do we do tonight?"
