ACT III: WHICH WAY HOME

*Scene: Niels Bohr Institute, Earth-1.*

HART-1: "If I'm involved in trying to save people, the least I can do is help me."

STONE-1: "Let me know what I can do."

HART-1: "The first thing you need to do is let me take charge.  I'm not happy pushing you around, but in this case, it's clear my other self trusts me and not you.  And if what he said about your Earth-2 equivalent is right, I don't expect him to."

STONE-1: "I know I'm your junior colleague, but I'm not something to be ashamed of."

HART-1: "You heard how he reacted to your voice.  I'm not triggering him again.  It's not worth it.  Second -- keep in touch with our Earth-2 visitors and their other selves.  If it's at all possible to provide updates on the situation to them, we will.  This may be how we have to divide our workload."

STONE-1: "Understood.  What do they know?"

HART-1: "I told them everything.  That we are on opposite sides of England's political scene.  But it means nothing -- they are not us.  Whatever Earth-2 Stone has done means nothing about how any of us view you."

STONE-1: "I... I didn't think it would, but..."

HART-1: "Sorry.  I don't know how much cat and mouse is going on.  Just remember -- even if they can find us, talk to us, and see us... we cannot allow them to find THEM.  Be it the Earth-2 couple or my resister.  Lives are in danger."

STONE-1: "All right.  I'll be the go-between.  If there's something they need from you, I will come to you."

HART-1: "Thank you.  Now..."

*A voice is heard over the Earth-2 communicator.*

VOICE: "To the Earth hearing this: acknowledge yourself!  This is the British Empire demanding acknowledgement!"

STONE-1: "Is that me?"

HART-1: "I'll do the talking."

*Hart-1 picks up the microphone on the two-way.*

HART-1: "You are speaking to a government-neutral science station in an alternate Earth.  Identify yourself.  Over."

STONE-2: "This is Charlotte Stone of the Empirical British Science Service.  And you are out of line to order me!"

HART-1: "What is it you want?"

STONE-2: "We know you can see into our lab from your position.  We also know you have been in communication with traitorous forces in the outskirts of London proper.  We view you as aiding and abetting the enemy.  Rest assured that we will not take this lightly.  Consider this a warning: it should be in your best interest to remain outside this conflict, or we will pursue all options of prosecution.  Am I clear?"

HART-1: "Roger.  We hear you.  What visual do you have on us?"

STONE-2: "We have enough.  Your communication to us has allowed us to notice that your plans are doomed to fail.  Already now, the Empire is circling in on your pathetic little movement.  Unless you cease all communication and aid us in bringing the traitors and criminals to justice that we seek from you, you will suffer the consequences."

HART-1: "I suppose you refer to my look-alike in your world."

STONE-2: "You are to stop talking to him.  If you do, we will make sure it goes poorly for you.  That is the first command.  The second one is to return the fugitive we know you have so that he may be punished for his crimes."

HART-1: "What makes you think we can?"

STONE-2: "You will work on doing so.  If you are able to enter our world before we can enter yours, you will send him and his victim back so that justice will be served.  If we enter your world first, we will take them, and all who stand in our way will fall."

HART-1: "Good luck with that.  You're going to need it."

STONE-2: "Do not mock me!  I already have a position of power you never will.  The snake has circled the rat.  It will strike when ready."

HART-1: "Then let me address what I can.  First, as to this fugitive: our government has ample reason to believe in his innocence and will treat him as such.  Furthermore, as of now we are well aware neither you nor I have the technology to voluntarily cause the intersect necessary to return them.  Only energy, not matter, can be transmitted voluntarily.  As for my counterpart: I have only spoken to him once.  He has sent me nothing I can use against you.  I do not know how to contact him right now.  You are on your own."

STONE-2: "Very well.  But our threat remains.  I expect you to respond when called upon.  God Save the Leader!"

*The line goes silent.*

STONE-1: "Am I that crazy?"

HART-1: "Impossible.  Environment does things to people.  She made a choice I know you will not make.  Now... we need to talk to our political refugees."

*Over video conference.*

HART-1: "So this is what I know.  They are attempting to break through and force themselves into this universe.  You are their objective.  They do not sound merciful."

CRYSTAL-2: "No... NO!  It's a lie!  I'm not a victim!  I'm with him for real!  He did nothing!"

HART-1: "You know your leaders better than I do.  Do you think they will give an American the benefit of the doubt?"

ANDY-2: "Look... how close are they?"

HART-1: "From our view, not even remotely.  This is a bluff to make us work on sending you back and to make us stop aiding Hart-2.  I can assure you, neither of these things will happen.  And if you know anything at all about where the government secrets are buried, please allow us to relay it.  Every edge we can give is an edge we need to take."

*Andy-2 leans back and clears the hair back from his forehead.  He sighs and shifts his weight.*

ANDY-2: "Take down these notes I can give on the structure of the former US Embassy in London.  Assuming it's still standing, these will aid our Resistance greatly..."
