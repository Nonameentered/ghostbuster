(Now that the contest is over, I'll add an ending.  Wouldn't be fair otherwise.)

Tim didn't quite understand.  The Naomi in the picture was looking back at him, sympathetic and wondering.  Tim wasn't sure if he was hallucinating.  But perhaps talking would help.

"I'm sorry, Nay," he began.  "It started so well, but I failed you.  I let you down.  All this time... I let you down."

Tim stared back at the picture... was Naomi shaking her head?

"I tried.  I'm sorry.  I wish I had another chance."

The picture blinked out and back in.  This time, Naomi wasn't posing; she was looking straight ahead.  Her arms were outstretched for that familiar, welcome hug Tim had felt thousands of times.

"If only," Tim said to himself, sighing deeply and letting the tears fall.

When he opened his eyes again, Tim saw Naomi pointing.  Following her finger, he looked at the buttons by the side of the viewer.  Unsure of what else to do, he began pressing a few of them.

"I can't believe Dad would do this," Darren said mournfully as he helped clean up Tim's place.  After moving around some of his photography equipment, Darren noticed the camera on the ground, still showing that first photo.  "Hey, Mom," he said, turning to Naomi.  "Is this you and Dad?"

Naomi looked at the picture of them at the mall.  Both were young, excited, and happy together.  He was kissing her cheek as she smiled the widest grin.  Just seeing it caused the memories of the good times to flood back.  "Yes, dear," she said.  "This was us, so very very long ago."

The nostalgia in her mind was only broken up by one nagging thought: they weren't a couple yet that fateful day.  In fact, she was pretty sure Tim took the picture of her.  How did this happen?
