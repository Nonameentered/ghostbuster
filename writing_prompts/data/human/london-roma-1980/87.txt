The chase was on.

It wasn't his fault that he had spilled a pitcher of beer on the big guy in the bar.  He got bumped by some guy at the pool table, honest!  But try telling that to ol' Macho Muscles.  Dude stood up in a rage.  There was nothing to do but get out of his way.

As he exited the establishment, he heard all manners of names being thrown at him, but one thing mattered: if he ran, he'd live.  He just wanted to go there to relax after stress at work, and now he'd found his way into more stress.  A dude with hands the size of bowling balls ready to throw down was not how he wanted to die.  Not even on the top 100.

"Hey!  Over here!  Let's go!"

Oh, thank heaven, his friend had just gotten back from his errands.  Just one problem remained: the friend was in another parking lot, he was escaping one parking lot with a big man behind him, and a highway lay between.  Well, he didn't become #1 in the state at Frogger for nothing, did he?  Time for the cowardly nerd to put those skills to use.

All while the insults and insinuations flew from Man Mountain Maniac in the back, calling him scared and worthless, he began.  One sprint through one lane, a quick shuffle left, to the median.  Then again, across three lanes this time.  His pursuer stumbled out after him, but didn't have the co-ordination from his early drunken escapades.  A loud horn and metal on metal soon followed, as their chase caused a bad crash in the right turn lane.

But that was the big guy's concern.  He had made it to his friend's car, to his sanctuary, ready to buckle up and get out of dodge.  Sure, it wasn't the most manly way to escape a situation you were a part of, and odds are he could never show his face in that bar again, but there would be other Fridays and other adventures.  He didn't have a scratch on him.  It was time to head home.

Observers now know: the chicken crossed the road to escape a beating.
