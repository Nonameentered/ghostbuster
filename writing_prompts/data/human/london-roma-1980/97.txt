"Shouldn't leave the door unlocked, Doc."

Liv whirled around upon hearing the voice.  The person speaking was still in the shadows of the doorway, but Liv noticed the only two things she had to: that he -- and it was a "he" -- was much bigger than she was, and that he had a gun.

"What do you want?"

"To give you a little fun," the voice said, but with menace that belied the words he chose.  "After all, all work and no play... and you need a little play."

The figure stepped forward.  A mask covered the lower half of his face, rendering him a stranger to Liv.  "Now... put your toys away and let's get started."

Liv was too afraid to run to the back door, and she knew that the university access she got was private.  She had no idea who this man was, or how he knew she'd be here alone.  This was her nightmare brought to life.

"I... I warn y-you...," Liv stammered.  "...I got some really dangerous stuff... stand b-b-back..."

The figure kept a short distance.  "Don't try to run.  I'm watching you."

Liv was desperate, and in desperation, anything becomes an opportunity.  She looked at her glassware, and her beakers... and at her creation.  She knew the formula by heart.  It was reproducible.  She wasn't.

Liv grabbed a glass beaker and put the gel she created in it.  The mixture soon took the shape of the beaker from the inside.  She opened the door to a storage space above the lab space.  Then, she steadied herself.

In one motion, she hurled the beaker at the stranger's eyes.
