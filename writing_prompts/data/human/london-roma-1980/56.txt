Okay, this is hilarious.  As someone with lawyers in the family, I can attest that this is exactly the kind of legal mumbo-jumbo and missing the forest for the trees that happens regularly.  Love the surrealism!

I'm not sure where this could be improved unless you had more charges to pile on.  The "(Excluding Carrots)" addendum to the legalese title seals the absurdism of the piece.  The only way I could think to improve it is to have Mr. Crane as a witness, but since there was no defense at the trial, I'm not sure it would help.

Well done, writer!
