(PART 2)

"That's why."

Jenny's first words to me as I sat down and shook off whatever spell was upon me were all she had to say.  She had asked for help with her stepmom, and now I understood: it was about freedom.

"What... happened to us?"

I was scanning my surroundings as I first spoke.  The basement looked like an ordinary room -- a couch we were sitting on, bookshelves, and a side room with the door closed.  Nothing about it seemed out of place, even though my whole evening at this point felt out of place once midnight had struck.

"My stepmom is a dark witch," Jenny told me.  "I mean, she wouldn't want me to spill the secret, but you know it now.  She's really powerful.  For as long as I've known, she's told me what to do.  She says she can do it to anyone under 20, and... I guess she's right.  I'm sorry."

"She has the Purple Man's power?"

Jenny didn't have to be a comics fan to get the Marvel reference.  "That's part of it.  I don't know how deep her power goes.  And I'm scared to find out... but I think we might."

I willed myself to stand up.  "Look, she told us to wait in the basement for her.  She didn't say to sit idly by.  Maybe there's a way out so we can escape."

"You think so?"  Thankfully, Jenny wasn't so far under that she couldn't be independent in her thinking.  "I've explored here lots of times while doing homework and haven't found anything yet."

Anyone who saw even one mystery show would have done what I was doing next: pulling on random books on the shelf to see what the response would be.  But after about a dozen tries and no sign of any of the books being attached to anything on the shelf, I determined that was a non-starter.  The only obvious exit was back up the stairs, but as I approached them, I felt myself not wanting to get too close.  After all, I was to wait for her.

"What about that door?"  I began to walk to the closed door to the side room.

"No, don't!"  Jenny popped up and grabbed my arm, pulling me back to the couch.  "I'm sorry, but... I am to keep anyone from entering that room when she's around."

"Her order?"

"Her order."

We sat dejected for a few minutes.  Finally I spoke in turn.  "You know, this all went so well to start... I know you said you wanted me as a boyfriend, and... I wanted you as a girlfriend.  If there's any way out of this... should we just officially be going out?"

Jenny turned to me and beamed, the happiest she'd been since we started heading home.  "I'd love to," she said.  Slowly, we both leaned in, and soon, we were sharing our first kiss... as our arms wrapped around each other.

"YOU ARE TO STAY TO YOURSELVES AND WAIT!"

Her stepmother's voice boomed down the steps as she began to walk toward us.  Jenny and I quickly separated and practically jumped to opposite sides of the couch.  What should have been a wonderful milestone was just the next chapter in a nightmare.
