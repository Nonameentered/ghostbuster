At the door, Gwendolyn and Emily were greeted by a respectable-looking man in a waistcoat.  "Pardon me," Gwendolyn said, "We were hoping Olivia could come to the door.  We are her tea-time friends, and we are most worried about her absence the past fortnight."

The man smiled.  "Oh, do come in," he said.  "I'm Dr. Bryan Livingstone.  It is a pleasure to see you."

"A doctor?" Emily gasped.  "Is Olivia unwell?"

"No, no," Gwendolyn reassured her.  "This doctor is one that Olivia had been seeing for a few months.  Is the courtship progressing well, Doctor?"

"I would say it is reaching a satisfactory stage, but I wish not to jump to conclusions," Dr. Livingstone said, barely concealing a wicked smile.  "Please, let me see what I can do.  May I get you anything?  A second tea, maybe, for a friend?"

The ladies agreed.  After about fifteen minutes, they were in the study, enjoying their tea and gossiping about what a lovely chap the doctor was.  They also took time to compliment his artwork... although if they had taken a closer look, they may have fainted from shock.

When Dr. Livingstone returned, carrying a tray with some unusual knick-knacks on it, Gwendolyn felt impatient.  "Where is Olivia?  She is here, isn't she?"

The doctor smirked.  "She is," he said as Emily found herself feeling light-headed and confused.  "And soon, you will know more about her absence."
