Okay, one more time looking it over ought to do it.  Every i was dotted, every t crossed.  Every accusation backed up by a receipt and a hard copy.  Every innocent explanation refuted.  There was no doubt that could be had from this evidence -- the governor was in a lot of trouble.

And I'm the lucky man to break it.

Everything's on the CD.  It's all ready for formatting.  I've got time before we put it to bed -- no need to yell to stop the presses.  Still, something like this -- gotta give it the weight it deserves.  CD in the case, case in hand, rush to the Editor-in-Chief.  He's got to know how big this is.

Here ya go, Chief.  The big headline.  All you need.  Yeah, I checked it -- everything adds up.  This one's a story, boss.  Goes all the way to the top of the state.  Oh, yeah, this is gonna get big play.

Oh, right, phone call.  I'll wait.

...

Who was that?  Really.  Does the Governor know we're about to ruin him?  Oh, good.  Wouldn't want him to try to get ahead.  You know how they can be -- talk first, and you're the winner.  Nah -- this one's got all the facts.  It needs to be the break.

Wait, does it hurt how?  Oh, no, not at all!  I ain't takin' pride in bringing down the guy we all voted for.  No, you don't understand, I'm excited because I feel like this is my big break.  My first real scoop.  It's the thing we all dream about!  Don't you remember your big break?  You keep telling us all about it -- two arrests, three resignations...

...okay, okay, yeah, I won't get my hopes up.  Maybe he'll survive this.  But I just... I dunno, boss, it feels like this is the chance to make a difference.  Ain't that what we're about?

Thanks, Chief.  I'll see you tomorrow.

...man, it's gonna be huge.  I can feel it.  This is gonna get people talking down in the capital.  And this little paper's gonna be known around the country!  No way we don't get a big circulation boost -- and that means a raise for me!  Maybe even a promotion!  Oh, baby, tomorrow can't come soon enough!

**The Next Day**

Okay, okay, there's our newsstand.  Quarters in, paper out.  Man, I had so much trouble sleeping last night, but this is the big one.  Let's see it on everyone's mind!  Big time state official hooked by little old me!  Gimme that headline!

...uh, headline, headline... huh, not above the fold... where's the headline?

...wait, where IS the headline?

...

...

They put it.  On.  Page.  TWELVE.  TWELVE!!  Oh jeez, that must've been the phone call.

...ugh.  I bet this never happened to Woodward and Bernstein.
