*Back in the hotel room, the phone rings.*

ANDY-1: "Hello?"

STONE-1: "This is Dr. Stone.  We have some news for you that you may want to hear.  It concerns plans on Earth-2."

ANDY-1: "Plans?  Like what?"

STONE-1: "Well, Earth-2 is working on bringing your other selves' kids here to our world.  That way, their entire family can remain under our system's supervision.  We're aware that letting this out in public right now would be premature, but we think this is a better way."

ANDY-1: "And what sort of guinea pig are they going to be?"

STONE-1: "Oh no, nothing like that.  They'll be under observation, sure, but it's not like we're going to [give them diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Syphilis_Study) to see what happens or anything."

ANDY-1: "Good.  What should we do?"

STONE-1: "I'll let you know when the transfer is imminent so you can be here.  Right now, Other Crystal is kind of in a shell.  And given the world their kids are entering, they may want to know the truth as soon as possible."

ANDY-1: "Well, I hope everything goes well.  How will this impact us long-term?"

STONE-1: "We're determining if it would be worth having you live near here for comparisons' sake.  Would that be something that can happen?"

ANDY-1: "Talk to the Ambassador and see if I can get transferred.  I'm sure you understand this isn't my decision to make."

STONE-1: "That does make sense.  I'm just glad they came from a more technologically advanced world than ours.  We can all work together and make this breakthrough a positive rather than a negative."

ANDY-1: "True.  Though things intended to be positives become negatives in the wrong hands.  Just look at how [a product intended to make mining safer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamite) became a war weapon."

STONE-1: "Not the first time.  But we will keep this within scientific circles until we feel it's safe for politicians to find out.  I'm certain the paper will not be published until and if we determine how to keep undesirables from making trips."

*A pause, then...*

ANDY-1: "Hey, why can't everyone live near us in the UK?"

STONE-1: "Well, I... no one outside of this lab has any idea what's going on.  It would probably be a bit of a culture shock.  That said, it is entirely possible that we can transfer the work if the money is right.  I guess I can put out feelers in the Lancet when the time comes.  It wouldn't be right away, understandably."

ANDY-1: "But that could be an endgame."

STONE-1: "I see no reason why not."

ANDY-1: "Good.  I know I have connections in London who know how to handle classified information.  I'll start the ball rolling when we return."

STONE-1: "Thank you.  I... I have to go, there's an update from the other world."

ANDY-1: "Got it.  Talk to you later."

*Stone-1 hangs up, then gets on the two-way.*

STONE-1: "Alt-Bohr speaking, come in."

*Nothing.*

STONE-1: "Alt-Bohr speaking, come in please."

HART-2: "...right, yeah, this is the good one, sorry, force of habit.  Anyway, let them know we've managed to get their children to safety at our base.  We think we'll be able to begin transfer shortly.  But..."

STONE-1: "But?"

HART-2: "Well, after that you may not hear from us for a while.  We've used our portal to examine a few alternate earths, and we found one that is underinhabited and without chaos.  We'll be busy sending refugees there."

STONE-1: "I see.  Do you think they'd want to live on this Earth?"

HART-2: "It would be too complicated to get them here and back.  Maybe at a future date when all is calmer.  As it is, there's a massive manhunt for them.  It appears Stone's death was not taken lightly."

STONE-1: "So rather than risk time where the guards can come through, just send them through?"

HART-2: "That's the plan.  We have your co-ordinates.  Is the power source fixed on your end?"

STONE-1: "Almost.  Thankfully, the power core is made of something we can easily replace.  The shield was a little harder to find.  How much time do you have?"

HART-2: "They haven't found us yet, so who knows.  But be quick about it."

STONE-1: "Roger that.  Out."

*She turns to Couple 2.*

STONE-1: "Quick, let's get some plexiglass and have it shaped in the engineering room.  Your kids are coming home."

*A few hours later...*

STONE-1: "That ought to do it."

ANDY-2: "Thank you, Dr. Stone.  I hope this works."

STONE-1: "It did before."

*Hart-2 interrupts on the radio.*

HART-2: "Alt-Bohr, is transfer ready?  Our security has been breached!  Time is running out!  Alt-Bohr, are you ready?"

STONE-1: "Ready.  Fire it up."
