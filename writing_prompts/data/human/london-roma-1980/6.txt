David went to the hospital chapel.  He knelt in the back row, lowering his head to hide tears of desperation.  On another floor, his wife Joan was being looked after by doctors, tubes everywhere and chaos overlooking the whole operation.  She was due to go into labor at any time, but a 103-degree fever meant she might not survive it.  And doctors assured her she could not be given anything so as not to endanger his child.  His first child.

As he looked around, he saw a piece of paper on the billboard.  "Today is November 30 -- Saint Andrew's Day".  David was never one to believe, but at this moment, he found himself willing to try anything.  He melded his fingers together and put them to his forehead.  Hiding the pain he had at his helplessness and the desire to gain the pain his wife was in, he focused.

"Saint Andrew," went his internal monologue as he silently held out hope.  "I don't know if this will even work.  I don't know if I can be heard.  I don't know if I'm doing this right.  All I know is that right now, my family is in danger, and all I can do is wait.  Please, if there's any way you can, find a way to save my love.  Let all of this pass from her.  Just tell me what I can do to make her better!  I promise, take me if you have to!  Anything!"

As his mind's prayer went from focused to garbled in emotion, David slumped over in the pew.  He couldn't even stay upright long enough to beg for his wife's life.  How weak could he be?  "I've failed," he whispered to himself, trying to look up at the altar and crucifix through tear-clouded eyes.  "I can't do this... help me."

An hour later, David was still waiting, sitting, beating himself up mentally.  Just when his life had reached its ebb, he felt a hand on his shoulder.  When he looked up, the doctor was standing next to him.  In that very moment, the white coat being worn by the hospital staff never seemed to mean more to him.

"Mr. Arden?"

"...y-yes?"

"I'm glad I found you.  I have good news.  Your wife is going to be fine.  Soon after she went into labor, her fever broke.  It's down two degrees and declining.  And the baby is perfectly healthy.  It's a boy.  Within a few hours, they'll both be ready for you to see them for the first time."

David remained silent and listened, but deep down, he knew.

As the sun came up that morning, Joan was cleared for visitors.  David walked in for the first time and met his son, who was sleeping in a crib nearby.  After holding his wife's hand and kissing her as though for the first time, he heard her ask "do you have a name?"

"Yes," David replied.  "Say hello to Andrew."
