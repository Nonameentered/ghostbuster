Her body was a deathly pallor, as though all humours had been removed from it.  Her eyes had rolled back, with no coins to weigh the lids down.  She had had her outfits taken from her, left only in her bedtime attire.

"Dead," Emily finally muttered.

"Murdered," Gwendolyn followed.

"But... how?  Did the servants do this?  Did a thief?"

Gwendolyn quickly spied a note on Olivia's desk.  "Perhaps this will be the answer."

Gwen read the note to herself, her hands shaking as she read more of it.  She passed the note to Emily, who also could barely digest its contents before dread took its place.  In the note, Olivia described a bizarre stranger from the East, a chance encounter with an ungrateful servant, and a feeling of being surrounded by the morning.  Her handwriting had grown untamed as the note continued until it ended abruptly.

"Oh dear... who could have done this?"

Before Emily could respond, a swarm of creatures flew down from the tower and in through the open window, surrounding the two ladies.  Bats!  They were surrounded!  Screaming did no good as the sonic bleeps from the animals tormented them.  Soon, all the bats took places around the bed save for one.  It landed at their feet and, to their amazement and fear, transformed into a giant man all in black.

The man spoke, unveiling a thick Wallachian accent as he did.  "You will never tell them.  Are you with me or her?"

"You did this!  You fix her now or we'll have you in the hangman's noose!"

"You have chosen," the man said, quickly overpowering Gwendolyn and Emily with the bats' help.  Soon those two would be side by side with Olivia, three bodies, victims of a new serial terror never seen before.
