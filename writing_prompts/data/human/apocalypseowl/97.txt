Don't you just hate it when somebody finds out about an old and frankly embarrassing thing you did. Like something really stupid you said or did when you were a teenager. It's awkward, the person that found out just lost a lot of respect for you, and you feel like a tool. Normally it's some really awkward video you put up on youtube back in 2008 that has like 154 views and three likes. Or a picture of you as a fourteen year old dressed up as a unicorn. Honestly, it's the worst part of having a past. All the embarrassing baggage that you have in it. I was no different when I was young. Always shirking off my responsibilities, always skipping out on lessons, hanging with a bad crowd. I'm glad that I'm old enough to have been alive before social media was a major thing, because there were a lot of dumbass things I did with my dumbass friends back the day that really makes my skin crawl from sheer and utter cringe when I think about them today.

So when I got *that* skull handed to me, from one of the other archaeologists here at the ruins of recently rediscovered Conistorgis, I had to supress an urge to groan. There is no doubt in my mind, despite the obvious damage from age, that it is my own skull. Or rather, one of my own skulls. Bit smaller than my skull today, wasn't a fully grown man when I removed it. I am an expert on pre-Roman Celtic cultures, supposedly because I have the most extensive library and the most discoveries of ancient Celtic settlements, grave sites, and battlefields under my belt as an archaeologist in the world. The truth is quite a different matter of course. Staring into that empty skull, I am shocked by how quickly that cruel memory returns. Of Conistorgis in my youth, when I was a lad. Of running with the outcasts to adventures that were unusually bloody. Of listening to the druids, and finding them quite boring. Of the dumb things I did back then. Shedding my skull, in order to scare the living daylights out of Kalstorik the butcher, was in hindsight stupid. He was always disrespectful of my mother, of my friends. Said that my father was a monster. He wasn't entirely wrong, of course. No normal human can shed body parts whenever they want.

''*So, what do you think? Surprisingly well preserved skull of a late teen, fairly healthy, got remarkably good teeth for the period.''* I nod to... Shawn. He is eager for me to talk about this embarrassing thing I hold reluctantly in my hand. ''*We found it in the remnants of a bronze chest, it had been hidden within the north wall of the temple complex. What do you think about it?*'' I remember of course exactly how they kicked me out of the city for having taken the joke too far. Been too weird. My mother had married... something. She never spoke about who she went into the hills to meet, and never took me or my siblings. ''*Could be... a holy ward of some kind. It's a well known pagan tradition to sacrifice something to give a holy site some kind of protection. Bury it underneath the original threshold of the temple. Even the Christians continued the tradition for centuries, burying an animal underneath a new church to make a Churchgrim. A related Scottish belief is that the most recently buried person acts as this protective spirit. Maybe this guy was a permanent version of this. A protective spirit, kept hidden and safe so evil would not harm the dead.*'' I am of course talking straight out of my ass in order to give them at least something. It was the Norse who did that originally, it was never a Celtic thing. It was just imported to the remaining Celtic cultures after Rome fell.

Shawn smiles and nods sagely as if I just told him the truth about life, the universe, and everything. He then thankfully leaves. And I collapse into my chair, memories of my long life returning to me. Mother took my siblings into the hills after that. Driven out by the druids and the farmers. Not even mother's position as high priestess could keep them from ignoring how weird her children were. Last time I came to these parts, they were still up there, further up than mother intended. Just... Feral. Wild. Didn't even look human anymore. If I hadn't played that dumb prank, maybe they'd have retained enough humanity to still be here. It was too late for them though. They greeted me excitedly, but like animals who had seen a long lost friend. They didn't have anything left of them that I could recognise, that allowed me to tell them apart. Their bodies were distorted. Insectile. Covered in chitin. They had enough left of... something, to show me mother's grave. And that was around the time the Visigoths invaded Iberia. It's the first time I've even been back on this continent in centuries.

Immortality, the ability to change physical shapes, to pretend to age. It does allow for a more comfortable life. I go to a new place as a young man, or woman a few times. New unrecognisable face. Settle in, help out, ensure that my various riches from over the years are stashed nearby if I need them. A few children of my own even. But only rarely. And not in this day and age when science and technology has made the world far more aware of abnormalities. People might forgive abnormal biology in an age where common knowledge holds that mice are born from rotting straw. But in an age where people are far less moronic than they have been, that can't fly. At least my children had, well, not entirely normal human lifespans, but back then people used to die quite young, so a few people who could live to be in their 90s, well, that goes under the radar.

As I stare into my own skull, something which I had casually removed, shed like a man sheds his clothes, even though it made my head quite gooey and unpleasant at the time, I think of them. Up there. Are they still in the high hills. Are they still up there? Alive? Slaughtered by unknown human forces, that never wrote down what they did? Taken to our other home by Father?

I leave the tent, leaving all my human treasures and equipment behind me, and call out to some of the guys; telling them I'm going for a walk, and will be back shortly. They are so enamoured of me, and my knowledge about the ancient Celts, who I walked among since long before the founding of Rome, that they don't mind a little eccentricity. The paths have changed, but as it is late evening, and I feel a desperate longing, I do not care that I adapt my flesh and change my body. Within me human bones crack and remodel to become something faster. More agile and used to mountains. If they have gone even more feral, I also change the shape. I become as I remember them. More arachnid or insect than anything else as I scuttle up the mountains in the dark November evening.

The skull reminded me of my past. Of what I am. A half-breed. Part human, part something else. Something older. Stranger. And much more adaptable. Cast out of my home, I have worn a thousand faces since them. Most of them human. Desperately trying to fit into a society, where I am an immortal outsider, no matter what role I play. I have been a king, a beggar, a priest, a farmer, a soldier, and every kind of scholar imaginable. For thousands of years I have turned away from the highland where my mother raised her other children, my siblings. Because she asked me to. And because I was ashamed that I had caused us to get thrown out. Because I didn't dare to go down there to the city, blade in hand, leading my siblings to conquer our home, and force it to accept us. I scuttle faster and faster, desperately hoping that they might still be there, waiting for me to return, waiting for their wayward brother to come home again. I pass mother's ancient and decayed grave, noting briefly with joy that it remains intact, undisturbed by man, and yet they are not there. My siblings are not here.
