And yet her quarry was attempting to escape. Behind the smouldering house, the cowards were onboard a helicopter, trying to take off. But she could not be stopped. She could not be hindered. She leapt into the air and in a move that should under laws of physics be impossible, but the laws of magic quite reasonable, stopped the rotating helicopter blades with her hands, tearing them off, causing the machine to tumble over from sheer momentum, and throwing her off. Inside of it, something wearing the clothes of human, but who hath proven himself unworthy of the title, screamed at her. ''*You're dead! You're dead!*'' In horror, the monstrous cretin tried to fire a pistol at her, but the bullets bounced off her skin, the few of them that managed to connect that is. She raised him up by his throat with her right hand, her flesh burning his, while her left hand grew claws that gored into him. She looked him in the eyes, and she knew she was victorious. He was nothing now. Vengeance was sweet, and soon enough, all the horrors would be forgotten as her rebirth would come.

She threw him down unto the ground and threw the kukri at his head, the partially molten blade killing him instantly. She jumped down and saw that the red door had reappeared. She walked through it once more, to find that the strange stone-flesh room had been refurbished. A small pile of inviting shiny metal laid on the floor. Silver, gold, platinum. She felt tired. Her mind had experienced the sweet taste of vengeance, but now she felt groggy. Tired. And done. Soon she would forget. Soon she would be reborn. That was the deal. She laid down on the pile of metal, curled up into the foetal position, and began to fall asleep. Around her she could feel something grow, a shell of sorts, made from the metals. But it was alright. She had lost everything as a human, except vengeance. Now she had gained it, and was ready to be reborn fresh and without the horrors of her past. Reborn as the dragon she knew she could be.

Strange that such things should happen in one of the edge bazaars, but even dragons need new members sometimes, no? And those who are burned out on everything except that final inferno that keeps them going, they make for good dragons, or so I am told. Ah, but the time has passed, and the day is done. Come back another day, and I shall tell you of a different customer, in this market of mysteries, this bazaar of the bizarre, this trade-port of twisted tales.
