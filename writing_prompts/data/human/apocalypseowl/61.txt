The Sentinel nods. ''*So, we take over the world then?*'' Doctor Terminus nods. ''*I convinced the other supervillains to give me a chance to talk sense into you. We're about ready to overthrow the governments, tear down the corporations, and finally show the hateful masses, why they should have been better people. Most non-shit head heroes are getting a similar offer as you are. Only less personal.*'' The Sentinel looks down at all the people who've hated him, even though they owe him their lives. He didn't want to get the key to the city, kisses, and parties. He was willing to just do good for the sake of good, but everyone called him a menace. Everyone talked about him like he was an idiot for not being corrupt and self-serving. Had Jesus been born once more unto the Earth, people would have done the same shitty things to him. Because the passionate thinking people, who dare to dream of a better tomorrow, no matter the cost; they have changed over the years, they have learned, improved and adapted. But the masses, they're still the same psychotic crowd that was laughing as the lions in the Colosseum tore innocent men to bits. The same who cheered when Christ was upon the cross.

''*I'm not going to become as you, but I'll still join you. They're... in need of guidance. Of a light in the darkness.*'' Doctor Terminus holds out his hand to Sentinel. ''*They need a shepherd, to lead them from out of hate and ignorance, and into something better.*'' The Sentinel nods and shakes the offered hand. ''*Even if we have to kill many sheep to lead them to the light.*'' Both of them grin, as they turn to the masses. The same angry, hateful, idiotic masses, that never for a moment considered that they should have shown a little gratitude. A little kindness. A little understanding. A little respect. It costs nothing, after all.

Instead, the age of the Superheroes end, in blood, in fear, and in catharsis. As the cold, ruthless supervillains, bolstered by the many scorned and isolated superheroes, begin a new age. An age of pragmatism, scientific development, and the ignorant masses who once came close to ruining the world, consigned to history. The world no longer belongs to the common man. It belongs to the supermen.
