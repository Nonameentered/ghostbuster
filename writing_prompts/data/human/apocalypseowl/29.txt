Most people can be described with some accuracy. They're tall, they've got curly, neon-hair that spikes like the 90s are back. They're short, really thin, pale, kind of horrifyingly intelligent in an abstract inhuman fashion that makes them seem like a robot or the human-shaped vessel of an elder god. They're normal height but muscular, tall and gangly, chubby and cute. I am surrounded by such people. Every day someone with weird hair and a monotone voice is challenged to some kind of ''magic duel'' in the occult club by some person with violently violet hair. Every day some girl who looks like she was designed by someone who has only seen beautiful artwork falls head-over-heels in love with some flashy weirdo who plays an abnormally popular children's card game. Every day the weirdly hunky dudes in the school's sports club act like they're the myrmidons at Troy, with the two most sparkly, muscular, and objectively handsome dudes acting suspiciously similar to Achilles and Patroclus. And those very peculiar girls who keeps being late to class and who look awkwardly similar to a team of magical girls, they're pretty unique and easy to describe, considering their weird colour-coordination in hair, clothes, and their even weirder tendency to be defensive around those odd amulets they all wear around their necks at all times. Hard not to be able to pick them out of a crowd.

I am not like any of them. I look normal. Bog-standard. Completely in the ordinary. My height is average for our homeland. My hair colour is the only natural one in the entire high-school. I am of healthy weight, and have an average physique. You can't even see me on the class photo because everyone else looks so unique that it's like I'm invisible. Besides those pale, arrogant, and super intelligent people who act like the fate of the universe will be decided by their percentage on the national tests, I've got the best grade average, though that's just because I pay attention in class and show up on time. Pretty awkward sometimes when I'm sitting alone with the teacher because everyone else isn't present for history class. I have to wonder what keeps them away from class. I have the average eye-colour, hazel-brown, which is weird considering how many lilac, pale blue, ice-grey, verdant greens, amber-yellow, gold, shimmering, and heterochromatic eyes we've got here. I'm not an eye-guy, but that has to be something of a coincidence that everyone has such diverse eye-colours. Or maybe there has been a sale on coloured contact lenses and I didn't notice. Frankly, in most settings, except for this weirdly specific high school, I'd be one with the crowd. I wouldn't stand out. I'd look so normal and regular that my own parents would have a hard time recognising me, which has happened before I transferred here, but I guess I can't blame them for that.

My daily life should be what you'd expect from a high school. Regular classes. Regular after-school activities. Regular everything. But weirdly, this isn't so. My day starts when I, as the only person, gets there on time. Everyone else seems to either be terminally late or have somehow broken into the school before it opened. I sit down for language class, and I find it difficult to see what the teacher is doing on the blackboard, because someone in front of me has a haircut so bizarre that it blocks my view. I am however used to this, so I angle my head to a point where the golf-ball sized hole in the hair is, so I can see what we're doing and take proper notes. I block out whatever is happening behind me, as it seems that the two most traditionally desired girls in class are in some sort of disruptive battle over who gets to smooch the foreign exchange student who everyone says is actually an elf from another universe, but I'm pretty sure those long pointed ears are just a weird costume.

After the first class has ended, three different people who seem to roleplay as spies tell me not to trust one of the other three people and pay me money not to associate with either of them. The money is some kind of worthless monopoly money that I've never seen before, so I throw it into the trash when they aren't looking. While walking to the lab building, someone dressed as a medieval plague doctor drags me into the janitor's closet and warns me that the cafeteria food is not what it seems to be. Which I am already aware of. Everyone knows that the cafeteria food is primarily made from horse hooves and the organs of pigs or chickens that cannot even be sold in an American junk-food restaurant. Nobody ever eats the food there. I, for one, have brought a sandwich from home. I am thrown out into the corridor again in a rude fashion, but I don't complain. The teachers hate whiners, and the student council is too creepy. Last time I complained about getting stuck in the school during that weird Halloween event, the head of the school council, who looks like she's from the Grudge, followed me home.

I had to threaten to call the police to get her to go away. Down the corridor I have to dodge two guys sword-fighting, which is probably part of drama club's training. I don't care what they say about the spirit of theatre, phantom of the opera, or the ghost of William Shakespeare, having practice for this year's big play out in the open just ruins the play. And delays my path to math class. Not that the teacher would notice, he's so old, dusty, and bony that people say he's some kind of math lich. Whatever that is. I just do the stuff and try not to get distracted. Though that is a bit hard as the math club are shouting about proving some guy called Riemann, while those colour-coordinated girls are facing some green-haired goth guy who is pontificating about the weakness of mankind. I just do the exponential functions questions on the board.

When that's over, I wait for the next class to begin in the same room. Sitting next to me is my childhood friend who is gushing about her crush on some guy in a magician's tuxedo. It's pretty weird how she acts like she doesn't remember me, but then again, I am quite forgettable. I don't mind, much. Maybe a little, okay. In history class, one guy falls out of a window and then everyone seems to forget that he was ever a student, except now he's a historical character in the court of Oda Nobunaga for some reason in the history text. Probably one of those elaborate pranks people like to pull around here. It'd be pretty typical for some guy to quit the school by pretending no longer to exist while having our history books replaced with identical copies with fake history about himself in them. I preferred that time those nerds almost got run over by a truck and then had their dads pretend to be them when they ''returned'' atop horses with fake unicorn horns on them.

I eat in the cafeteria while sitting functionally alone. There are people around me of various sorts who are talking about what has to be their weird roleplaying games, which are strangely popular around here. Dragons, demons, monsters, the fate of the universe. They're pretty into that. I don't judge, I enjoy a little dungeons and dragons every now and then. But I am not part of their groups. I sit surrounded by people, eating my sandwich, but I am all alone. My perfectly average sandwich, a BLT, tastes sort of grey whenever I start thinking like this. I don't really fit in here, and I don't have a lot of friends, as everyone seems to be completely absorbed by their talk of mechs, bioweaponry, and magic. It's interesting sure, but it leaves a regular guy feeling a little excluded sometimes. Even now as everyone starts screaming because they're participating in the impromptu and unannounced zombie walk, with the most realistic zombies I've ever seen. Why, that one right there seems to have been cut in half around the belly, with the guts hanging out. Pretty realistic, very well made, but I just can't get into the spirit of the thing. Everyone else is either taking up fake weapons from nowhere to fight or bravely leading their friends to safety. Panicked voices on the PA system says that the rest of school for today is cancelled, so I head to the roof to finish my sandwich, listen to some music maybe. Usually it's full of pale weirdos talking about the fragility of life, but today it's pretty much empty.

They must be participating in the zombie walk event.

I watch the helicopters coming here to take the many rich students home. It is weird that there are this many rich students at a seemingly normal high school, but why bother questioning that. People can do what they want. I sit down and eat the rest of my sandwich, annoyed that my education is being put on temporary hold because of some social event. I notice some movement out of the corner of my eye, and to my surprise there is a girl. She seems to be average height, normal hair, regular brown eyes, wearing the school uniform instead of some kind of business suit or weird costume. I wave at her, and she walks over to sit down next to me.
