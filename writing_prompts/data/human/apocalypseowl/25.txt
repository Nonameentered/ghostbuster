What happens when people with incomprehensible powers get bored? When those who can reshape reality with a mere thought, starts sitting around waiting for something interesting to happen? We don't know. We really don't. Not because it hasn't happened, but because we don't have the vocabulary, or even the mental capacity, to understand what actually happened. The day the gods got too bored. And all started to get creative. Every pantheon. Every deity. Every divine entity. Messing with the universe at once. In a secret location underneath the Swiss Alps, there is a time recording device that exists outside reality. It was commissioned by a group that never existed. Built by hands that were never born. And made from materials that has never existed and cannot exist. Yet it does. We don't know what happened when the gods got bored. But from the unreal clock, we know that it took a total of 13.7 billion years to reboot.

We asked the gods about it. And indeed, they partied, or fought, or... did something, so hard that they had to rebuild reality from scratch. The entirety of the universe was rebuilt, quark by quark, by the gods. Few of which are actually competent. Many of which are very fundamentally untrustworthy, down-right idiotic, and capricious. Nobody is going to ask Dionysus to make a perfect replica of anything. Nobody will ever trust Loki with... well, anything. And we're pretty sure spiders used to be smaller before the universe was rebooted. Anansi claims they've always been the size of panthers. And we can't be sure.

We cannot allow that to happen again. Never. That's why we made the Program. Well, the governments did. All of them. Even the crazy ones like North Korea. The gods are treated to every luxury. They get to lounge around our best spas, our best hotels, our best theme parks. All operated for the gods, and they're *always* leagues better than the ones we humans get to use. But that's not enough. That is nowhere near enough. The gods are complex, bizarre, and incomprehensible. In most cases. If it was just Zeus we could just hire beautiful women to distract him all day. But these are not just a singular god, they're pantheons. With complex social interactions and behaviours. Which is where you, and all your new colleagues come in. Special entertainment is necessary. The best of the best. We fake the deaths of amazing actors, musicians, artists, etc. And send them to entertain the gods. Forever. Or until the gods grow bored of them. And that might last a while. We've got youth serum to keep people from aging. We've got soul-cages to ensure that you cannot escape through death. And we've already cloned your body in case you try so we can put your escaped soul into a clone body.

And yeah, it can take a while. Buddy Holly has been on the roster since 1959. And he is still popular. Elvis is *still* playing. Heath Ledger and Marilyn Monroe are co-starring in a new movie together, an interpretation of the Arthurian Mythos if it was about biker-gangs in the 1980s. Freddie Mercury and David Bowie are doing a truly haunting duet right in the next theatre here at the Olympus Complex. Betty White and Robbie Williams are doing a vaudevillian comedy with Gilbert Gottfried. You, we're starting out easy. There is a Columbo/Murder She Wrote crossover being made behind that door now that Angela Lansbury has finally accepted our offer, and we need a good murderer for it. You fit the bill, and you'll get time to rehearse. Of course, you don't have much of a choice, and neither do I. They need good administrators of all those people who have to please Odin, Shiva, and Tengri without offending anyone.

Trust me. There is no escape from this. Hope that maybe in a century or so they get bored of you, in which case you can get to walk out, live in the normal world again, or pass on if you're too tired. We've got a job to do, and if we don't keep the gods entertained, who knows what might happen. Of course, there are benefits. Not many, and not my department. You'll get a brochure of what little good might come out of this. If you just keep acting, keep performing, it'll all turn out alright.

Oh. Just a little piece of advice. Don't antagonise the gods. Don't complain about the universe, don't bother them with the poor and the downtrodden. These are primordial gods; they have more in common with despots and tyrants than they do with real people. Don't try to reason with them, or speak out against them. And don't, above all don't try to outdo them if they decide to compete with you in anything. We don't know what happens to the people who do that, because their names and identities are erased from existence. We just know that it isn't pleasant for them. Smile, be polite, be professional, and again, avoid treading on any toes. Because they're probably going to smite you for it.

Welcome to the rest of your life.
