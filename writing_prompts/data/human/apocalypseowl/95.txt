Unfortunately, as I wanted to make every paragraph weirder than the last, I fear that a continuation of this will end with something wholly incomprehensible.

I could theoretically pick it up one day, when the POV character emerges from his pod, and sees a world reborn. But right now, I haven't got a clue on how to continue the thread in an organic fashion, without trying to invent a way to describe life with more dimensions than the average human can perceive and experience. (Which I have thus far been unable to do in a satisfactory manner.)
