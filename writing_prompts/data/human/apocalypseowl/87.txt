I've been in retail for ten long years. Not because I want to, but because I have no other options. I have an STEM degree, but I live in the middle of nowhere, and my student debt is enormous. I can't afford to move, I can't afford to flee, I can only work in retail, paying off my debt bit by bit at a time. And with the interest rates I've gotten after the criminal oligarchy I live under has gone to hell, it isn't noticeably shrinking. My chances of ever getting out of my hometown are gone. Every day I see people come into the store, the old who made mistakes like I did, and the young who are leaving soon. I wish I could join them. I really do. But I have to work retail, there are no other options. So there I am, stacking boxes in the employees only area of the store. Opening them with a boxcutter. Sorting out the goods to a small metal table with wheels, which I'll then put in the cold storage. I do this every night of every day except Sundays. That's my day off. Unless somebody is sick or on vacation, or just absent otherwise. Then who is called to take over for them? Me. Because I have nothing else in my life besides a dead-end job in a dead-end town in a rapidly collapsing nation. I'm hoping that whatever corporate-feudal state I get to live under after the States collapse won't lobotomise me. Though on the other hand I wouldn't have to mentally deal with Karens anymore, which would be a huge plus.

While I open the boxes, stack the wares inside on the metal table, I do however dream. I dream of other worlds. Realms of magic and swords. Where the hidden elven paths snake their way through the forests, where dragons roam the sky. Lands where adventure and mystery are commonplace. Lands where I would not be shackled by a digital debt for something I never got to use anyway. Lands that don't need retail workers, but great heroes, mighty mages, cunning rogues, brave rangers, and countless other fantasy tropes. Splendorous and unknown K'dath, the realm of a thousand and one nights' tales.  From sunken Atlantis to flying Dalaran. The idea of those lands, where a man can breathe free, where there is a new beautiful horizon to be found across endless worlds of wonder, that's what keeps me going. It's what keeps me alive. For I may be shackled by debt and law in my life, but in my mind I am free. I can smile to any horrible customer who thinks they're right, because I am not there; I am in the great halls of Erebor. I can stand it when some jumped up power-mad manager chews me out because I am incapable of being three places at once; because I am flying on the back of a beautiful dragon over a desert made from dreams. I do not shout out loud or complain when some horrid spawn from the womb of hell bites my legs, because I am not there; I am hunting lycanthropes in the deep woods with the elves.

While I daydream I suddenly feel something odd. I come back to reality, and see a strange otherworldly light before me. Trembling with excitement, finally, either a gateway to another world or aliens kidnapping me, either way it's a path forward. So I take it. It engulfs me completely and utterly, and it feels sort of similar to how a bath in blueberry yogurt on Mars would feel, if done while drunk. I pass through, and it feels timeless in there, like I stay in that realm for a mere fraction of a second and an eternity at the same time. But pass through I do. And arrive in a place where strangers stare at me in wonderment. Wizards, for what wizard wouldn't use such a pointed hat, elves with their pointed ears, and other people in medieval garb. Clearly real stuff, not the kind you see at Ren fairs or medieval re-enactments. One of them reaches out his hand to me, and I grasp it firmly and thankfully. ''*The hour is nigh and the need is great. We've summoned you in this time to do something that you are the best suited for, that none of us could ever do.*''

I nod, smiling. That kind of thing. Isekai? Hero swept away to a different world, though I note that I didn't get hit with a truck, as is customary in such scenarios. I try to look as heroic as it is physically possible to do in a retail store uniform. ''*Tell me your need and the task ahead shall be done!*'' And the wizard hands me a box. It's got a tag attached to it, says ''newt eyes; dried.'' I look up at them in confusion. ''*I'm sorry, maybe you should be a bit more specific.*'' One of the elves rolls her eyes in a way usually associated with the kind of infuriating people who want to be like Californian valley-girls but just makes you consider a career as a monk, or eunuch. ''*We've summoned you because everyone else quit the store, and it's nearly Sanctum Night. We want to buy gifts, so we conducted a ritual to summon the best suited retail employee in another universe. The most perfect employee who will always work retail no matter what. Someone who would never quit his job in retail, who would know that the customer is always right. Now get on with it man, I have things to do.*'' I stare at the wizard stunned for a moment. He is about to speak again, but I stop him.

By stabbing him in the neck with the boxcutters I had held on to.

As he falls to ground, bleeding heavily, I stare with unbound and unfettered rage at the people who summoned me. Retail. In a fantasy universe. It's still bloody retail. They are too stunned to react before I turn the boxcutters on them, while screaming at the top of my lungs. ''*THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS DEAD! NO RETAIL! NEVER AGAIN!*'' They did not expect me to turn on them. Do they think that I would gracefully accept a fate like that? They did not expect a retail worker to kill them. I honestly did not expect to kill them either. But I did. My blood hands rummage through their clothes for whatever money and weaponry they have on them. Magic items and so forth. Some food and filled waterskins from the store itself too. With a proper sword at my side, a book of spells in my hand, I leave the store. A small handheld crossbow hangs by my side with a small quiver. I would never have left my job back on Earth, because I was bound there by the shackles of debt. Never again in my life will I ever even want to enter a retail store.

Of course, as I leave the store, people outside have already called for the city watchmen, and they're not surprised, just well-armed and well-armoured. So I stole a horse that one of the people I must have massacred inside the store had left outside the gates. Riding comes back to me, all those years living in the ass end of nowhere did give me good shooting and riding skills, if nothing else. Behind me the guards blow into horns, and I can see ahead as I force the horse to gallop faster than any normal horse back from Earth could ever do, that they're closing the gates. I killed before, enraged to be told that my fate was to be a miserable retail employee for the rest of my miserable life, but now I kill in cold blood, firing the crossbow with surprising accuracy at the guard who was about to drop the portcullis to the city gates. One single bolt is all I need, as it perforates the guard's neck. He dies without being able to prevent my escape. The guardsmen fire arrows after me as I bolt into the night on a stolen horse.

I have no idea where I am. Or what city I have just fled. My heart races, and part of me feels guilty for killing people. Another part of me has been dreaming of killing annoying self-absorbed customers for years. And a third part realises that I have defied fate itself. I will never again work retail. I am an outlaw. On the run, with a wizard's grimoire of spells, and blood on my hands. I dare not stop until the horse is out of breath and needs to slow down a bit. If this world has retail, has annoying customers, and all that, then maybe it has other problems, similar to my world.

Hm. I wonder if the position of dark lord is filled. If it is, I'm sure they'll accept me into the armies of evil. If not, perhaps I should work towards taking that role for myself. A small part of me abhors that evil, but that part has been grounded into the dust by years of poor pay, long hours, incompetent managers, vile Karens, the obnoxious hellspawn of vile Karens, and the demand by corporate to always smile and be polite. Maybe, if I had been called here years ago for something different, then I would have been on the side of good. But after years of soul-crushing work in a toxic environment, well, I'm no longer built for kindness. It is a sad truth that when someone is freed from years of torment and horror, they rarely become kind and merciful. Hate, vengeance, and rage are far more common results of someone emerging as an independent force after all that. It's why managers are often cruel, vile, and incompetent. It's how they were treated when they were employees.

I'm not a better man. I am a bitter man. And I'll take anything I want from this world until it kills me. Because I am never going back to the nightmare I was shaped and formed in. I am never going back to retail, so help me gods above or demons below. Instead I shall ride my horse through the land, and what comes, may come.
