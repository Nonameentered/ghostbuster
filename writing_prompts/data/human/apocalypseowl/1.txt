Thank you kindly(*how did this happen though???*), I shall answer forthwith.

1: Well, I have to say that I am quite fond of [xenofiction](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Xenofiction), as in stories that have the unique perspective of a non-human POV. They are much harder to writer, and thus provide a far greater challenge(and possibility for improvement in terms of writing). In terms of reading such stories, I find that they are nearly universally interesting, though also harder to understand, in comparison to your average human POV story. There is just something inherently fascinating in seeing the world through the eyes of a robot, an animal, or an alien.

2: Hard to tell, there are a lot of good stories, from a lot of good writers on here. (*I like Lady_Oh, but she doesn't post much anymore, sadly*) My favourites, as in those I personally liked writing the most, are those like [the Sunrise City](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/mlj528/wp_for_as_long_as_you_could_remember_you_and_your/gtm3hlx/?context=3) where I can just go absolutely feral and write something nuts, but I am also quite fond of the more emotional stories; Like [Risen Angel](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/r4hnai/wp_everyone_knows_about_fallen_angels_you_are_the/hmh537j/?context=3) or a more recent [one, about a sweet bioweapon](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/y9s3i3/wp_you_were_raised_by_an_old_soldier_one_day/it7gb9r/?context=3). Gives me some delightful feelings.

3: Hard to say just how long I've been writing. Under the ''ApocalypseOwl'' name, I have written for about 8 or 9 years, but I've been active on various sites since I was quite young; I guess since about 2004 or 2005, that was when I started. It was naturally not great, and like many people in our age, I got my start in fanfiction along with original writing. Good thing that the hard drive from back then has been completely destroyed. It definitely isn't up to mine or anyone's' standards.

I guess I just started because I felt like it? Due to a variety of complex reasons, I was a bit of a lonely kid who read a metric tonne of books. And I was constantly running out of books. I wanted to see if I could write some stories to increase the possible amount of fiction in my vicinity while I waited for books, and it turns out the answer was yes. Still, took a lot of training to get half-way decent. And I've still got some way to go.

Hope that answered your questions.
