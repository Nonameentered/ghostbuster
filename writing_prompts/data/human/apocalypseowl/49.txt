There is something incredibly fine about mountain air. A certain crispness to it, that you just don't find elsewhere. North Cascades National Park is just the kind of place to go for that sweet air. Ever since I was a little girl, I've been hiking along the mountain trails, where my old man used to show me how to camp, fish, hunt, and survive. I'm sure there are a number of different kinds of childhoods that are all equally good, but I still maintain that mine was probably one of the best kinds. When I grew up working as a ranger was quite a natural fit for me, and later as teacher too, because it allows me to share the beautiful mountains with young, impressionable people. Even if some of them are pretty damn annoying. We've taken a bus up into the middle of nowhere, and made camp somewhere fairly isolated, but shielded against the wind. We've set up the tents, had some nice food made on the campfire, which was made responsibly of course, dug hole with an air current setup, to prevent any potential spreading of the flames. And now, underneath the stars, well, underneath the tent canvas, me and the students, 10 in total, have gone to sleep. Would have been more but the principal back at the school has the courage and willpower of a stoned rabbit. So it was left up to the parents if they'd let their kids come this year.

Naturally, the parents who are on the whole mostly unsuitable to raise any kind of human, kept their kids home; while the kids who have parents that don't indulge and spoil them, sent their kids with me. And because there are only 10 of them, the principal didn't see the need to send a second teacher. Oh well. At least these kids will have an interesting time in the mountains. Hm. I rise slowly from my position in the tent. Quietly. And get out of there. I smell something. Something odd. Something familiar. I am not supposed to have any weapons with me, but I always bring a sharp knife, just in case, so I take that out. Feels off, somehow. That smell. It's something dangerous. Something that is coming nearer. I can even hear the soft moving paws hitting the grass nearby. I turn to stare at the place where the sound and smell comes from. I bare my teeth in a vicious snarl and move closer. Growling, to let it know that I know its out there. That I won't let it get any closer. That it needs to back off. It isn't frightened, but it should be.

It's getting too close. To *my* pups.

Rather than letting it get close enough, I lunge first. It is startled, but I see exactly what it is. Cougar. It tries to strike at me, but I have my claw... knife, ready. And it slashes across the big cat's paws. It screeches in pain, but I don't stop, forward, forward, teeth teeth! Claw! CLAW! KNIFE! Belly! Pain. TEETH! NECK! **RIP AND TEAR!** The iron taste of blood runs hotly into my mouth as I see that I've killed it. My claw-knife in its gullet, my teeth deep into its throat. I warned it. Not to come closer. Those are my pups and no-one is going to get them. Dragging its corpse back to the den, I recognise that I've been scratched too. Huh. Worth it though. To protect them. And the dead foe will be adequate food to replenish the energy expended on defending them. The pups are awake, looking at me with awe, as they should. A part of me tears open the red box, and begins to tend to my own wounds. I grab one of the pups, and have her help me with working the gauze and the stinging feeling of alcohol upon the open gashes in my face.

Oh. What just happened.

Oh no. I keep calm while I sit there with my pups, no, the kids. The students. And I realise what has just happened. I've recalled the subconsciousness and senses of my past life. No doubt about it. It's unusual to experience, because most people in their previous lives were so simple organisms that their previous lives couldn't affect them in the here and now. Prokaryotic lifeforms aren't exactly known for having complex instinctual responses. I've just remembered what it was like to a be a mother-wolf. To defend the pups. To mind the males. To smell out the path to the prey and to recognise the scent of those who would gladly feast upon my offspring. I am of course not closely blood-related to these pups, but due to my work as their teacher there is a pseudo-parental relationship between me and them that triggers those same wolf-instincts. And I just killed a cougar that I could probably have scared away with shouting and a flashlight.

This is not great. Especially considering that the bus won't be back to fetch us for a whole dang week. Usually such instincts are easily repressed and put back into the subconsciousness, leaving only the enhanced senses behind. But since I am out in a place where wolves can be found, in a situation where I need to survive, this could get somewhat unpleasant. To overcome the instincts, one must be in a place and situation where they don't get triggered enough to leave a permanent mark. Honestly, this would be pretty cool if it weren't for the unfortunate time and place. Of course, the situation can be remedied. Shame that it will mean that the trip will be cut short. I'll probably get chewed out by the principal, but considering how people left to their own devices that suddenly develop these instincts can become, he'll ultimately understand that it's for the best.

I get the pups back into the tent, where they probably aren't going to be able to sleep much, but it'll be fine. I just have to wait for the morning, then I'll call back for help, and everything will turn out fine.

''*What do you mean you can't send anyone up here?*'' I am exasperated. My wolfish instincts wants me to pounce on the principal, and having barely slept at all, feeling forced to cook the cougar meat and eat some of it to quell my instinct to devour it raw, it's a good thing that he's not here. ''*What do you mean evacuation? Uprisings, shootouts in the streets, national guard infighting? What the hell?*'' That's... less than great. Frankly that's pretty damn terrible. You leave civilisation behind for a day and it all collapses. What are the odds? ''*Damnit Irving. I've got p... students up here. I'm covered in cougar blood! I am knee-deep in wolf-instincts! Come on! I don't care if you have to drive the bus up here yourself, or get one of the parents to do it!*'' I am not a happy wolf-woman. ''*Can you at least give me an estimate for when you can come fetch us?*'' It's no good. I can hear what sounds like explosions in the background. Principal Irving begins talking but the line just cuts out in the middle of a sentence. Either the satellites are out, or the school got hit.

New plan. Get the pups to a better place. A more defensible area. I know where there is a ranger station in this national park. It's within my territory. It'll be a safe place for them. We pack up the tents, the food, and the items. Tell them that we have to go to a safer place. We can have a safer den there. Some of them are scared, some of them are obedient, all of them give me the respect accorded to the pack's leader. I make it clear to them that if they're with me, they'll be safe. We're wolves, after all. That part of my mind means it quite literally. They just think I am referring to our town's football team. There is some major wolf-iconography going on there. I worry about that. That putting myself in this sort of situation, where survival in the wilds will feed that instinct, will be dangerous. I don't think I'd ever harm the pups intentionally. But if nobody finds us for a while, what kind of wolf-children will I make of them?
