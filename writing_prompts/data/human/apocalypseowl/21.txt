There is a natural consequence to group infighting. The group becomes smaller. And other groups, less prone to internal conflict, can use this as an opportunity to expand. That's practically the history of dragons summed up. Dragons used to rule the world. From the wide blue seas to the snow-capped mountains. All of it were ruled by great and powerful dragons; burning ambition and power personified and made into flesh. Dragons are however not great at working together. Oh, they're social creatures, that's true, but they're very territorial, highly aggressive, and often unhealthily ambitious. That's how the first war, waged across the entirety of the world started. There was no more room to expand, no more open land to claim, and no more wealth to uncover. So before the first elves left their nomadic lives in the woods behind to create cities, the skies burned. When the first men lived in crude huts and subsisted off whatever they could scavenge, they often had to hide as fire tore the land asunder. Though afterwards, they ate well off of the battlefields, sharing the well-cooked dead dragons with ravens and wolves, earning mankind a long-standing kinship with those races that persists even to this day. The first dwarves carved desperately into cave-walls about the terrible sky-lizards who fought, killed, and died.

That war lasted for centuries. It cost uncountable lives, and the remaining dragons no longer ruled the world. But still, they were mighty, and their lands could not be contested by the dwarven mountain cities, nor the petty elven kingdoms. The dragons tried to work together again, and as many of those who had been the most aggressive, violent, and territorial, had died out, the remaining bloodlines were more peaceful, more cooperative. But it wasn't enough. When the first men built their clay cities, and the elves entered their glorious golden age, where elven civilisation reached its apogee; that was when the dragons once more fought themselves. For each dragon that fell, more land was lost, for each egg crushed accidentally, mountains were claimed by the dwarves, for each whelp captured and tamed by the elves, dragonkind became weaker. Until the last king of the dragons was slain by the first high king of humanity.

But the dragons survived. And multiplied, but they were smaller, weaker, and more cautious than ever before. Never again could they claim dominion over much. Some tried to fight back against the mortal races, but were driven back. Crushed by metal knights favoured by the gods. Pierced by magical elven arrows. Turned into organic forges for unscrupulous dwarves. Today, dragons are rare. Which is why it is odd to see one as a part of an army. Not the magically weakened dragons, those wyrms who accepted the elves as their masters, and who are little more than cunning animals now. No, a real dragon. Tough bronze scales, sharp claws, and an elongated body that acts as a focus for flames that can melt the walls of any castle. It is clad in specially forged armour, protecting its body and preventing some cunning knight from immediately hitting some kind of vulnerable spot, such as the eyes. And it is leading a small company of other, younger dragons. It is taking part in a human war, and takes orders from a human king.

But how can such a thing be? What makes a proud dragon, into a soldier of fortune?

About two-centuries ago, a young dragon came out of the mountains, not wanting to submit to the remnants of dragon nobility, he had gone to the lowlands to live on his own premises. To do such, he would need wealth, a treasure of his own, but very few cultures bury their dead in barrows anymore, and all of them have been plundered long ago by older dragons. His name was complex, long, and involves noises in ranges that are both too low and too high for most mortal races to hear. But it might be translated, in simple terms, as ''Shades-His-Mind-With-Mists-Of-Dreams-And-Will-Of-Light''; which is a quite inaccurate and very simplistic translation of a name that describes its owner's soul and personality completely and utterly accurately. He was known, by the few other dragons who knew of him, as a curious and very unconventional dragon. Which was one of the reasons he had come down to observe the mortal races. He wanted to learn from them, to see if he could prosper the way they were prospering, rather than rotting away on a few isolated mountains, as a servant to arrogant elder dragons for the rest of his several thousand years of life. Which was the lot of most dragons in that part of the world.

He listened to human gossip from afar, when they weren't observant, hiding beneath black waters, or above the trees. He listened to noble knights, hard-working peasants, indolent priests, and many others. But it was when he overheard a company of human soldiers talking, when he learned of something interesting. Humans would regularly pay other humans to kill different humans for them. One could earn a lot of gold, or other treasures that way. These people, these condottieri, lead companies of men to battle for nothing but gold. This, the dragon reasoned, was something that he was capable of doing as well. It wasn't easy to get started though. Most humans have adverse reactions upon seeing a fire-breathing, intelligent, serpentine creature offering them something. But despite a few false starts, and a number of rejections, he kept at it. And at last, one king was desperate enough to offer the dragon, who the humans in their simple way called ''Willowlight'', mishearing part of his translated name, a contract.

This king was in dire straights. His armies had been routed. His nobles had abandoned him. His knights were few and mostly wounded. Soon an army, led by a greedy and ambitious cousin of his, would begin to lay siege to the capital. Willowlight was offered a handsome reward, if only he'd kill that would-be usurper and his army. The dragon, knowing well that he needed to be smart about this, flew off to observe the rebel army. Indeed, it was massive, and Willowlight correctly assumed that the king would soon be disposed, should he fail. And should he fail, he wouldn't get paid. So he waited, observing the marching army from afar, until night came. That was when he struck. Dragons are not usually a part of warfare in these cases, and thus the sentries did not see him flying above their camp. Nobody did, as Willowlight glided without a sound above the sleeping soldiers. But they soon learned of his attack, when he rained down fire upon the camp. The thousands of pack-horses and destriers, frightened by the smell of fire, the sound of dragonwings and the general unpleasantness of being awakened in the middle of the night by an inferno did the thing horses always do in such cases. They panicked and stampeded over the many soldiers who were scrambling to figure out how to deal with a sudden and unexpected dragon attack. Willowlight had no intention of doing such a thing as sticking around however. He had a task to do, and with no great ceremony, he divebombed the would-be king's tent, and grasping onto any humans he could, with teeth or claw, he flew straight back to the rightful king.

The king was delighted to wake up for a family reunion with his partially burned cousin, and promptly executed the man. Reports from the country-side said that the rebel army itself had collapsed due to the chaos involved with the horses, the fire, and the sudden non-existence of their leader. Willowlight was paid handsomely. Or so he presumed, as neither the king nor the dragon was quite sure on the exact amount of wealth this action was worth. But the king erred on the cautious side and gave more than he thought was proper, as to not offend the huge bronze-scaled, fire-breathing mercenary. That was the start. Willowlight could have used this wealth as a means to gain rank back in what little remained of the dragons' civilisation, but he had a better idea. Using the wealth, he had a special suit of armour constructed, strong enough to protect against arrows and small ballista bolts, light enough to be used for short term flight. And then he sought more battles to fight.

Wars and battles were plentiful in that age, and the warring nobles of the many human kingdoms found that having a dragon on their side was quite a valuable investment. Willowlight had quite the career in that time. Carrying a small strike team into the Black Fortress of Caverghul, to free the young heiress to the elven empire. Leading the deciding charge in the battle of the Two Emperors, earning himself a substantial bonus for cutting down the Crimson Emperor and burning his cadre of necromancers. Greatest of achievements was when he held the line on the Drenna River against the resurgent elven Ylveranan Hegemony, during their crusade to reconquer the lands that the elven races lost to mankind after the death of the last god-king of the elves. For three bloody years. He was of course paid extra for that.
