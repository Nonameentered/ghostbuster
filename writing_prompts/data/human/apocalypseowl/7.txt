This is not a normal hallway. Not one would find in a school, or a hospital, or any other public building of large size that usually have hallways. It is not even the sort that one might find in one of those ludicrously large and expensive to maintain Victorian manors and mansions. This is more like walking down the long hallways of the tomb of a pharaoh. The walls and floors have obviously been carved through solid alabaster, and have then been polished so that they practically sheen in the firelight from the torches on the walls. I don't recall how I got here, nor do I know where it is. And yet it is a strangely familiar place. Like somewhere I have once visited in a dream. Every step I take is a silent one, as I walk forward, sensing the distant scent of fresh ocean air from this direction.

On the walls there are grand pictures, like paintings, but so much more detailed than even the finest of artists could ever achieve with any manner of paint. Each of them depicts a scene from a world. And strangely enough, the subjects depicted on the wall move slightly, as if the picture was a window into a different universe. There a moving image depicts a world where two infants are held in the arms of a mother, one with the features of an angel, and one with the features of a demon. Their mother seem to favour the angelic baby with more attention. In the background of this dark scene in a peasant hovel, what seems to be the father is sitting near a fire, looking worried. I pass it, and the next depicts a different scene entirely; there are strange aliens talking in a ship orbiting the Earth, they seem to have the gear of archaeologists and researchers on them, as if they're readying an expedition to an Earth where mankind is long gone. Each of these aliens seem so strange to me, but to my glee, they are proper aliens, not merely human with a small deviation as seen in most fiction.

There passes a scene of a man in a normal apartment, teaching a small dragon how to play chess. There is something familial about the way they're interacting, as if he is the dragon's father. I cannot stop looking at the images as they pass by me, all of them so very intriguing, all of them so very strange. Each obviously not in the same universe. There, a god-like entity wielding a flaming sword of justice, assists one of his followers, wearing an equally amazingly blazing sword, with slaughtering members of the American police with frightening brutality and grace. On one of them I see a strange city bathed in the red light of dawn, where the roads don't make sense, the buildings shift like they're alive, and the people look as strange and wonderful as one could ever hope to imagine. Around me, the alabaster walls are adorned with these wonderful moving pictures, where one would usually expect to see hieroglyphs and written spells in the way of the ancient land of Kemet.

There, a young woman embraces a creature made from raw abyssal void, around her, the creature is fighting off creeps and sickos, defending her perfectly. I stare at each of these marvellous scenes in abject wonder and amazement, as the worlds depicted almost beckon me to stay and watch them forever and ever, so that I might learn what will happen next on each of them. And yet I press on. Curious, forever curious, wanting to know what lies at the end of this path. And after passing countless worlds of unbridled and unmatched amazement, worlds that defy explanation, that none can ever hope to even dream of, I come to the hallway's end. An ancient door. Truly ancient, it bars my way ahead. Its age have allowed fresh ocean air to pass through its cracks. It is made from stone, and it cannot easily be opened. And yet, I drag it. Using all my strength and all my weight, I wrench open the ancient door. The light from the outside hurts, and it takes a moment for me to adjust after only seeing the faint light of the torches for so long. How long? I cannot say. Time has little meaning in such a place, but I think I have walked for days. Weeks even. Passing through the gate, I come to a wild landscape near the sea. This is land that has not been touched by man. A blasted heath of ryegrass, wild heather, and elderberry bushes, leading down to a sandy beach where the wild and primordial sea churns.

I breathe in, the fresh air feeling good in my lungs after so long in that hallway, passing all those worlds. The only sign of civilisation is that ancient gate behind me, attached to no buildings nor any land, acting as a gateway into some manner of gallery depicting worlds that are hauntingly familiar and wondrous in nature. The other lies before me. A comfortable chair by a black obsidian table, upon which an active laptop sits. Over the chair, I see my favourite jacket draped, old and worn as it is, and yet it is a great comfort to put it on. Sitting down on the chair, I remember where I am, and what this is.

This is death.

I could pick any world of my own mind to be reborn into, and yet I pressed on. I kept going. Never satisfied with any particular world. For a single world is not enough, no; indeed it is nowhere enough. But as I sit down I stare at the laptop. It has a music player ready with all the music I've ever read. There are headphones attached to the laptop, which I place on my ears. Into my mind comes beautiful tunes that are exactly what I need to get the creative waters going. I might be dead. But I'm not done making worlds. Not even close to done. A thousand realms have a million stories to tell. I open up a Word-like program on the laptop, that seems to be eternally charged despite not being connected to any obvious source of power. And into I begin to make another world. Another adventure. Another universe. Again. And again. Behind me, if I take off my headphones, I can hear the hallway growing longer, with more pictures being made in it. More windows into more worlds. More gateways into new realities. This is good. I put my headphones back on as the next song begins, and my fingers dance around on the keyboard, writing yet another reality, one of forest creatures and their civilisations after the end of men.

What lies behind that gate, was my own personal heaven. Where I can write forever, without ever having to do anything as unpleasant as work or dealing with sleep or people again. Only the worlds of my own will and dreams. And once I can surely no longer think of any new worlds, I think I shall try to be reincarnated into one I have made, surely that experience will grant me the time to think up new worlds. And when I return here again, to this seaside where I can write until my mind is blank, I shall have new ideas again.
