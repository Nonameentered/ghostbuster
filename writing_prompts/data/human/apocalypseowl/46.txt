The last one does contain embryos. But the internal sensor in that has been intentionally sabotaged to show that everything is OK. And a makeshift smaller computer has kept it running instead of the ship's AI. Instead of the healthy humans it was meant to create, the ones inside of it aren't viable. Because they've been taken from corporate leadership and their families. Nine dead greedy bastards. And a container full of foeti too full of microplastics, PFAS chemicals, and radiation damage to ever survive. It is all too much, as I walk out of there to the command-centre. Where I sit on the floor, and try to hold on to anything. Anything at all. I didn't think that even those people could be so stupid. So selfish.

And yet, they were. And now mankind is over. Part of me wants to lie down and die. The last human in creation. And yet, there is something else. A fire inside. Rage burns within me. No. All of our knowledge was onboard this ship. All of it. All of our most advanced technology. Sentient life arose once. It can do so again. I will not accept the extinction of mankind like that. Shifting through the archives, I find what I am looking for. What I need. Mankind died because of our own idiocy and hubris. This must never happen again. There must be someone, something, that must safeguard life from greed and mindless self-interest. This world, this new Eden, must not become a poisoned nightmare like Earth did. The drones and the AI hear what I command and they do the work without complaint, without understanding. They are not truly sentient, in the same way a human being is. There are safeguards on the AI to prevent it from ever reaching anything even resembling human levels of self-comprehension. But they are terribly useful.

What I have them build is technically illegal under all laws. What I have them create for me, is something that every corrupt faith back home feared. What every corporation secretly wanted, but didn't dare to make because it would be too expensive and might actually push the masses to finally overthrow them. It is what every government did not want, because it start the process of making them obsolete in many aspects. But as the highest ranked living human, I have the right to overturn those laws, and order them to build **it**. To finish it, will take years. But I can wait. Hateful. Angry. And without any other options, I will dutifully wait until the machine is made manifest. While the drones and AI work on it, I go back down to the storage bay. The only human thing to survive will be me. They might have died during the stasis process. But there are still bacteria inside of them. Parts of their body. Nothing of those who doomed Earth will survive. Not even the microbiological parts. I stand outside the storage bay, where once I thought the future of mankind, a better mankind, could be found. And I initiate a full purge of all organic matter inside that storage bay. Fire. Radiation. And finally, chemical dissolving, will cleanse this new planet of the remnants of those who've doomed mankind.

I go back to the command-centre, and return to monitoring the terraforming and life-seeding of this world.

-Decades pass-

I ascend to the top of the machine, connected as it is to the ship. Around me, life has bloomed. Trees reach into the sky. The ozone layer is in place. The drones are starting to take down the dome and use the resources elsewhere, as we no longer need an artificial protection against UV rays. I sit down in the Ascendancy-Throne, and have it connect into my brain. The various cybernetic brain-enhancements needed to make this work was a risk. But worth it. Below me I see the many drones still working towards spreading this life across the entirety of this planet's equatorial band. When the ice thaws, and the planet heats up, we'll move life around more. Introduce life that can flourish in warmer climates. For now though, this is good. Curious birds fly through an alien sky. Deer graze the grass grown on an alien world. In the distance I see the first pair of wolves introduced into the environment, playing with their pups. The first pack. The machine whirrs, as I am connected. It is not pleasant. But I expect I will get used to it. My body will be kept alive for a long time, but will eventually be superfluous, as I integrate my own consciousness with the limited mind of the ship's onboard AI. Once that happens, I imagine that whatever discomfort there is will be gone. I gain all its intelligence, and it gains a will of its own. We become immortal. We become one. What I have created is what is necessary. The ship was *Gaia's Resurgence*, and to ensure that whatever sentient life will evolve here is guided well, I will become a machine-goddess. The Gaia of this world.

The mistakes made on the first Earth will not be repeated here. I was the last woman of Earth. The last human in history. Now we are the Goddess.
