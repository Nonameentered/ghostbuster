The greatest schemes of mice and men oft go awry. And that's practically guaranteed when there is a vampire involved. The vampire thought she had found the perfect candidate for immortality. A human being at the height of her vigour and vim. Intelligent, creative, purposefully hedonistic, living with no regards for anything but spectacle and wonderment. Someone who would live or die with no regards to the consequences. A person of the edge of death and glory. It was easy for the vampire to gain entrance to one of the human's parties. A trifle to get access to the human, and only a few whispered words of encouragement later, the human was taken to a room, where the vampire could do her dark work. Feed on the human, and feed her the blood of a vampire. The act so blasphemous would twist and turn the human's flesh until it's mortal body died. And then rose again as an unholy force. Stronger. Eternal. A childe of the dark nights. A scion of ancient blood. Another immortal who would rule the world forever behind the scene. It must be those who can handle immortality, who'd like the chance to be young, free, and powerful forever. Immortality, at the cost of a little human blood every now and then.

At least that was the plan.

The reality has proven to be quite different. The human did not react as was expected to becoming an immortal child of the night eternal. In fact, they reacted quite unusually. Newly turned vampires might sometimes complain a little about the sudden changes in their existence. They might have asked to be allowed to do some business deals before getting turned, or to have been allowed to live a bit longer as a human. Or something else. Once they fed though, and experienced the power and joy of eternal youth through blood, their complaints quickly stopped. This newly turned vampire woman, did not speak. She rose from the grave and immediately proceeded to rip out the heart of one of the vampires attending to her body. She then, with great fury and rage tore the confused vampires apart. She was young and weak, but she had the element of surprise on her side. And that worked to her advantage. The vampire who had turned the woman, looked on in confusion and horror as her wayward child killed her nightborn kindred.

Finally, some of the vampires managed to restrain the newly turned woman, and the vampire who turned her began questioning the newly risen woman. Why had she killed others upon awakening? Why had she fought with such ferocity? The woman, her rage filled body barely contained by five elder vampires holding her, screaming a curse so foul that even an ancient vampire would have found their recently consumed blood giving them a blush. The turned woman explained that her hedonism and mad art had been part of a ritual. Exploiting a certain loophole in the path to paradise, she had intended to propel her unworthy soul straight to Heaven, fuelled by her hedonistic lifestyle and her belief in herself, she would have tried to kill God. She was looking forward to doing that. And had been eager to die in the right way, to put an end to the supposed master and creator of everything. She had been planning to take his seat and rule the universe for a bit, until she would get bored of it. At which point she'd set up things so the universe could take care of itself, freeing reality of any cruel rulers. Letting everyone be completely and utterly free to be as good or evil as they themselves desired, without the excuse of a God getting in their way. Or in the case of doing evil, using God as an excuse for their own sadism and evil.

Now she would have to fight her way through Hell itself after her death to get to God. And that would be a long, boring, slog. A ceaseless campaign of centuries. If not several millennia. She didn't have the time for that nonsense. She had planned to kill God, and then create better universes after bringing this one to freedom. A sort of ultimate ''fuck you'' to a creator she thought was a bit of an unpleasant fellow, judging by his worshippers at least. The vampires were of course shocked by the sheer audacity that this newly turned kindred of theirs showed. They asked what she would have done if she had failed. She answered that of course, she would have tried a different method. Catapulting through heaven by creating an integer overflow in the amount of sins it's possible to commit in a single life was just the quickest method. The shock of her utterances were enough to let the elder vampires let go of her, which was their last mistake. She ruthlessly and efficiently slaughtered them, not noticing as the vampire who had turned her in the first place was fleeing as fast as was physically possible for a creature that can change shape.

The turned woman, the self-proclaimed godslayer-to-be, simply scowled as she drank the blood of the dying elder vampires. The rush of power and strength was nothing compared to the sheer force of her unconquerable will. Sure, her enemy might have directly, or indirectly, kept her at bay for a bit with this ploy of his. But she had a patience unending, a will wrought of the bones of the earth, and a serious problem with the current administration of the universe. Quickly gaining full control of her new vampiric powers through sheer will alone, something that usually takes decades to do for a new vampire, she began to pursue knowledge that the vampires might have kept in their sanctuary. Plan C of conquering Hell, ripping out the fallen grace of Lucifer Morningstar, and consuming it in order to invade Heaven could be put on the backburner for now. After all, she might not actually have known vampires existed for real until she woke up as one, but she correctly surmised that the wealthy and bloodthirsty buggers would have hoarded a significant amount of arcane knowledge that she wouldn't have had access to before. She could still complete her supreme work, and kill God. Maybe use his bones as materials for a new piece of art. She would just have to find some other way of speedrunning Heaven and getting the upper hand on her enemy.

The only good thing about the vampirism, is that at least she would have the time to discover a new method. The other one she had only discovered by pure accident, after all. No telling how long it would take to find a different method. But at least, now, she had all the time in the world to breach the Heaven, and tear down the tyranny of her own creator, once and for all. 

It was only a matter of time, before she could ascend, slay the fool upon his throne of weakness, and bring freedom to creation. No matter the cost.
