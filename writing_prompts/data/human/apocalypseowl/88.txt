''*The gardens, my liege?*'' I point again, more specifically. A pale girl with long black hair, feline eyes, and pale stubby horns is playing with gnoll pups and orc kids. They are playing the kind of games that only children will ever understand, and can never be remembered accurately in adulthood. ''*The prophecy, my captain, said that I would die at the hand of the legendary hero. But the empire itself will endure. It is not mentioned in that accursed prophecy. My daughter will be empress after me. She will have need of loyal women and men like you when I am no longer here. If it is my fate to die, then so be it. The unification of the world underneath one empire, with order and justice for all, will be completed by her. She, enraged by my death, will continue my dark crusade against the forces arrayed against the empire.*'' The captain stares down at the crown princess, who even at the age of five is a leader, controlling the entire game around her to be as fun as possible.

''*Will it be soon?*''

I nod. It will be soon. The senate, protected from corruption by a magical oath that kills the senator in question should they ever become corrupt, will manage the empire. The generals, as long as the logistics are in order, will be able to hold the current borders. There will be a reckoning, where I shall meet the hero, where his blade shall find my black heart, where I at last will die. Every evil choice I've made, every dark path I've trodden, will end there, and it will be worth it. For the idea, the empire I've made, will endure past beyond me. I have burned cities that refused to surrender, and killed my envoys. I have ended bloodlines that have ruled since the dawn of the world. I have ripped out the living hearts of gods and ended afterlives I found dissatisfactory. All my life, I've done this: been a conqueror. It was never to conquer further though, that made me attempt to prevail against fate and prophecy. I wanted time to be a father.

''*I will have to say goodbye to her. Hug her one last time, and watch as she waves after me. She will not know that it will be the last time she will see me. When I leave to meet my doom, you will stay behind and guard her. Tell her about me, give her something to remember about her father.*''

The captain's stiff and professional demeanour softens, as she lays a hand on my shoulder. ''*I swear upon the Empire that I shall see to it, sire. I will serve her, as I served you.*''
