It is the end. The hood is a shroud that lets me die without seeing those who will kill me. The hempen rope around my neck is a necklace of death, that inevitably shall leave a crimson mark upon my corpse. My hands and legs are bound, and I was carried to the gallows, where my fate is sealed. Even if I could get the binds off of me, I can hear the great and terrible clamour of the crowd around me. Yet even if I cannot escape, I shall try to get my hand free.

10 seconds till I fall; yet I will die standing tall.

Had I only died on the field of battle, where my brethren and sisters were slain. There I would be in good company. Here I hear only the rage of the maddened crowd; zealots and fanatics who have no idea of mercy or decency. Oh what I would not give or do to sit amidst my friends and fellow soldiers once again; before we turned to the fields of battle we sang songs of memory and melancholy. I remember the tears and smiles as we spoke of lost comrades, of the land we defend, of the future we fought for.

9 seconds till I end; inside of me there is regret that I can no longer to my duty tend.

I think of my father, back home. He was a flawed man, but he tried his best. He never let the world beat him down, never himself show emotions. Will the news of my death break him? Will his smile finally fade, will his eyes grow wet with tears, will he fall and have to be consoled by my sister and mother? I think they will. And that pains me, hurts me to my very soul that I cannot be there. He is old now. His back is weak, his hands tremble. Once he was strong, but now he is frail. Will he be alright, without me there to help him?

8 seconds till my death; upon foreign soil I will take my last breath.

I think of my mother; A woman of iron will and unending strength. A woman in total control of herself. The sort of woman who will not break under the sorrow. She will stand tall, and bear her grief with a dignity and grace that is nothing short of divine. She will carry our family through the darkness, and never complain; never whine; never buckle or bend underneath the stress of it all. She is old too though. Will it wear her down, like the endless churning of the sea wears down mountains to grains of sand?

7 seconds till the show stops; if only I could escape from this like some cunning fox.

My sister too comes into my mind's eye. Her husband came home from the war earlier this year. His hand chewed off by one of the enemies' war-hounds. She works hard to support him, for he can only work part-time with the one hand and the trauma, and her children too. Twins. My niece and nephew. I never had any kids of my own. So I treated them as a cool uncle should. Will she tell them about me, when they're older and they begin to forget, will she make sure they remember? Will she be okay, when her brother is dead and gone, the one of the few people who could truly understand her completely and utterly?

6 seconds till my doom; upon my grave I hope the flowers will bloom.

They scream about justice, about the wrath of god, about the end of all things. The enemy, who have captured me and brought me here to die. They are mad. Rabid. The product of hate and ignorance magnified, multiplied, and well-marketed. A decade ago, many of them would have been decent people. Or at the very least they would not have been this bad. They think this is their justice. Their righteousness. They know nothing. They are blind to history. They are deaf to the words of their own god, or any other. Theirs is the reflected screams of agony and hatred that bounce off the inside of iron skulls, until they become deafening roars of monstrous will.

5 seconds till my fate; any deliverance will come too late.

They think this is their victory. But I will prove them wrong. Though I cannot escape my fate, I will show them how a man dies. Not some abstract foe wearing a black hood of execution. No. That is not to be. That is what they want. They want to kill a man for defending his home, for not believing like they believe, for not hating as they hate. I rejected their offer in that prison cell, conversion and a peaceful death, because I will not give them an inch of who I am, or what is inside me. I decide my own death, and my own afterlife.

4 seconds till my curtain call; their victory I shall maul.

With a deft movement of my hand, freed from the binds, I rip off the hood and scream at them with bloody defiance.

''**I DEDICATE THIS DEATH TO ODIN!**'' That sentence took three seconds to scream. The hangman has already thrown the switch. Underneath me the floor gives way. And the masses of my enemies, the hateful ignorant masses who have called for an end to enlightenment, an end to knowledge, and an end to the future, do not see a faceless enemy die.

But a man.

The noose tightens. There is the sound of a crack. And all that follows afterwards is raven-black.
