It was baffling when the United States was the first nation to be attacked. Every time. Not a good thing for the society in question, destabilising in many cases really. Difficult to keep order and act reasonable when the nation is often under attack.

Usually it turned out to be just some small group that wrecked untold havoc before getting defeated by sheer numbers and gumption, but this time was different. This time it wasn't just some scavengers, or random invaders with seemingly no real reason to attack. It wasn't a small attack. This fleet blackened out the sky with ships. This invasion wasn't a ragtag group, it was a full scale multi-interstellar empire attack coordinated on the total and utter obliteration of the concept of the United States of America. More than 40 other countries, most predominant amongst them the People's Republic of China, was also at the same time invaded. There seemed to be no real rhyme or reason to the attacks. But this time, it was the end. The United States, disharmonious and rotten from the inside-out, was in no real state to repel any attack, and even if they had been a unified and stable country, they couldn't have amounted to more than a token effort against the enemy. Even the might atomic arsenal was quickly and efficiently disabled as the US government decided to take the planet down with them, and had all of their missiles and bombers disassembled by remote drones from the alien ships. Soon enough, the US, and a large amount of other nations around the planet, were under a military occupation by an alien force. The remaining free nations of Earth, having not been targeted despite providing military support to the nations in question, scrambled to create a more cohesive and united world government to provide a combined defence against a possible future alien invasion.

The new Alliance of Free Earth, was based on a mix between an EU-style political/economic union, and a WWII style Western Allies. One command structure, one unified world military, desperately reverse-engineering stolen alien tech in a hasty bid to ensure that the remaining nations could provide effective resistance against the extra-terrestrial threat. Beyond that, the AFE Army also kept order in many of the nations that had collapsed following the sudden blow to international trade, or had already been teetering on the edge of collapse anyway, such as warlord-controlled region once known as Russia. The new Alliance was economically and politically dominated by three arising powers within it. The East-African Federation, providing a beacon of structure and stability to the African continent, where many nations had been occupied by the alien invaders. The India-Japan Co-Defensive Agreement, which had swept up much of the Pacific and South-East Asia after the collapse of China and America. And the weakened but still functional European Union, which had managed to receive a few submarines carrying alien technology from the US before the government went completely insane.

But the question remained, why had the invasion stopped. Large swaths of the planet had been occupied, though only the United States seemed to be undergoing a harsh occupation. Refugees that manage to escape over the Mexican or Canadian borders, tell of mass re-education camps where the American identity is being wiped away, of massive child-care facilities where human children, taken from their parents, are indoctrinated into the alien culture. This contrasts with nearly every other nation occupied. People who've fled from China or Burkina Faso only reports the eradication of the previous political and economic leadership, reports say that otherwise, the occupied areas of Earth experience quite tolerable conditions for a military occupation. Some places are even being improved environmentally and developmentally. And the aliens have built strange machines in some of the occupied areas, or so the AFE spy satellites say, that coincide with a sudden and inexplicable reversal of climate change. Only in the United States are cities being torn down, only in the United States are vast areas of farmland being turned into wilderness. Only in the US, are there countless of reports of human deaths.

Eventually, as things settle down, the Alliance of Free Earth tries to reach out to the alien invaders. To open negotiations, to learn something, to establish diplomatic relations, anything really. The leaders of the Alliance thinks that the more they know about the aliens, the better they can fight them. Surprisingly, the aliens are quite open to the idea of opening relations. Very much so. It actually does work out pretty well. Except for one thing. Whenever the diplomats attempt to find out the why of the invasion, they're met with an answer from the aliens that's always the same. It's a variant of ''*It is obvious why we liberated those areas of your world.*'' And they don't elaborate. It's not until the AFE manages to negotiate an opening of the occupied territories, barring the former United States, that there seems to be a pattern forming. The areas are clean, healthy, full of humans and surprisingly some aliens who seem to be living in harmony. A human goes to dinner with his office mates, some of which are insectile or vaguely amphibian, some of which are vaguely humanoid, but definitely not humans. The cities are green and look like they were designed by people who are rather entranced by the solarpunk aesthetic. A man and what looks like a moth twice his size are on a date in a large caf√©. All of this comes from a scene in Havana, the capital of the Autonomous Zone of Cuba. But strangely, there are no signs of the old Cuban flag, the Estrella Solitaria.

Except in a museum. A museum of Cuban history, which has a new exhibit about the war. Strangely, the singular star on the flag has been removed. And that's when the rest of humanity finally finds out about the five-pointed star.

Tens of thousands of years ago, when the galactic community was young and everything was wild, a group of planets united under a banner with just such a star on it. And together they began a thousand year war that burned planets, butchered countless trillions, destroyed stars, sacrificed millions every day to uncaring monstrous and immortal eaters, who required a constant stream of fresh flesh to remain alive. It was known as the Aeon of Blood, and the nameless empire that united under this five-pointed star used to burn it into the surface of captured planets. It became the symbol of universal evil, as it took generations after generations of constant unending and brutal war to fight the nameless empire of evil back to their homeworlds and collapse the stars those worlds orbited into black holes, because that was the only way that this ancient force of unspeakable evil could ever be destroyed. And even then, millions of ships guard these black holes, just beyond the event horizon; In case anything ever manages to escape them. Something does, rarely, but it happens. No one is quite certain how the forces of evil, who have been struck from all records to render them nameless and weak, have managed to survive getting consumed by black holes, but something remains. Something evil, vile, and horrendous. Something that can still affect the outside.

Sometimes it's an ancient weapon, sometimes its a barely functional ship piloted by the dead still trying to break the blockade, but sometimes its a signal. A signal of untold evil that is sent to some primitive world, infecting the locals, making them take the symbol of the five-pointed star upon themselves and begin to conquer their world, in the hopes of one day freeing the forces of the five-pointed star. That is why the United States, who had a star-spangled banner carrying fifty of those, was always attacked first. It explains why every nation with a five-pointed star on them was attacked and occupied. When the alien diplomats of the Galactic Concord are confronted by AFE diplomats, they are shocked. They had thought that it had been quite obvious. They occupied every nation with a five-pointed star on their flag in order not to risk anything. They had come across primitive nations on other worlds before where the five-pointed star had been used innocently, but judging from American history, and especially recent reactionary insanity, the Galactic Concord, and all those various rogue traders, mercenaries, pirates, scavengers, and others who had attacked Earth in the past, an infection was likely. They had figured that the various garrisons in other nations, their various forced puppet-governments, and their insane leadership made it obvious to the rest of planet Earth that the US had to be put down as a rabid animal should.

The AFE declined to comment on the fact that they'd just sort of not ever thought of that, and just let the USA do what it wanted. In hindsight, with their manipulations of countless governments, their cultural hegemony, their various warcrimes, the horrid way the US treated its own citizens, the way the US had gained economic primacy because of the world wars, the leadership of the AFE felt that maybe they should have been a little more vigilant. Then some older leaders reminded the younger ones that being vigilant during the age of the ''Pax Americana'' was a good way to experience the old self-inflicted double-shotgun blasts to the back of the head that had been one of the more common methods the US had used to remove people who stood against their agenda back in the day. The AFE then quietly redirected their efforts on freeing every nation on Earth, to focusing primarily on freeing everything else other than the former US.
