He gets up, and dusts his uniform off. He then turns to me and mum. ''*Sgt. Fetcher. You're under arrest, and the experimental bioweapon will be returned to US Army custody.*'' To which my mum responds in the most unusual way. By laughing. Really cackling. It's a bit scary really. When she is done she climbs on my back to get the height needed to look down on him. ''*Colonel, with lack of respect. Eat my ass. You've brought a full company of Canadian soldiers, rather than your usual US Marines. You might be able to silently throw marines back home into a meat grinder meant to make dog food, but you don't have the reach up here.*'' Pointing at some red-dressed men standing further back, seeming very confused, her smile broadens. ''*You've even got the local Mounties involved. How fucking precious is that. How half of them are filming this on their smart phones, the rest are taking pictures.*'' The colonel turns around, anger evident on his face. Mum waves at them. ''*Hey luvs, are you lot listening?*'' Some of them nod confusedly. ''*This man here is trying to cover up an illegal genetic experiment program without the Canadian government knowing anything about it.*'' The local soldiers and policemen start muttering.

The US colonel, furiously, turns back to my mum. ''*You stole a secret, dangerous, experimental bioweapon. We thought you had destroyed all of them, but it seems you and your damn fool of a husband kept the one that had hatched. We had hoped to capture you along with your husband, but he never broke under advanced interrogation.*'' I don't like this man. He disrespects my parents. And he's very rude. I am unused to this level of social interaction with people. ''*Actually, we still got all of them. They're in stasis in a place you've never been. We didn't destroy any of them. You forced my husband to create bioweapons intelligent enough to take orders. Turns out you get something vaguely human in terms of mental behaviour. We saved them from you and the generals you suck up to. Colonel Malcom Ulysses Falkner, for breaking the universally agreed upon UN resolution against the creation of sentient life, and the related laws, I hereby place you under arrest. Boys, take him.*'' Behind the colonel, confused soldiers, realising that they'd probably get fucked over by the government if they let someone get away with this, moved towards the colonel. He tried to protest, but he technically had requisitioned allied soldiers to do his dirty work for him. That's... probably illegal. Mum had me read a lot of lawcodes for some reason. Maybe it's even technically treason?

One of the policemen, the Mounties, walked over to mum and me. ''*Ma'am, we understand how this looks, but we'll have to ask you and your... son. To come with us down to the station.*'' Looking back at the cabin, now perforated with bulletholes, mum sighed. ''*I guess we might as well get it over with. Come on Elijah, we're going to see civilisation, and people.*'' Part of me was a bit nervous, because this had all happened rather fast, and I had not planned on this at all. Another part of me was a bit excited. I've been wanting to see the world for a while now. The Mountie looked curiously at me, which was odd as noone has ever looked at me curiously before. ''*I must say ma'am, up closer, he doesn't look all that threatening. Almost cute even.*'' I cannot physically blush, but I held me forelimbs up covering my eyes while mum laughed a bit. ''*Yup. For a moose-sized bug, he's a cute kid.*''
