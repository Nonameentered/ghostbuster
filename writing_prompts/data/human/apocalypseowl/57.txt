We kept doing this, because I remembered what the world had become. Because when I spoke of the future, of the poisoned air, the dead seas, the brainwashed population, people began to listen. Because I knew and used tricks that propagandists of the future had used. Because I could recognise agents that infiltrated us, usually by how they talked, shortly after they'd gained entrance. Through the tools used by liars to render the world incapable of change, I built a movement around me. Loyal. Dangerous. And utterly dedicated to the idea of saving the future. Of preventing the end of all life as we know it. Of preventing a world which would make a cyberpunk novel seem optimistic. The Party grew around me. And soon we had members everywhere. Which was oddly enough how I lost control of it. My ideology outgrew me, radicalised further than I did. All I could do was to direct it in the general direction of various vile groups, and watch as an international army, took down groups of horrid people. But it went too far. Too fast. Soon we had prime ministers, presidents, entire governments, answering to the propaganda-machine I'd built up around my organisation. Organisations that had sprung up in my previous lives, had been swallowed up early by ours. When the Party and the technologically advanced machines we used in it, united much of western Europe, I knew that I was no longer in control. I had the best intentions, but now I stood as the unifying figure of millions. Billions, when the Second American Civil War started, and our Party subsidiaries in Latin America and Africa used the distraction to start the takeover. By 2011, nearly half the planet's population marched underneath one banner.

The technology we had pioneered had actually done a lot of good. Slowed down global warming considerably. The standard of life for people in Africa  Prevented the rise of unethical monopolies and monstrously self-centred billionaires who hoarded money and then hid it in tax shelters. But it was unnerving to watch as billions lived and died for a future, that some guy from Cardiff getting constantly reborn had started. Even more unnerving when I couldn't stop the Party from making honesty-chips mandatory. Our computer tech was way ahead of my original life, and we'd found a way to prevent corruption permanently. And ensure loyalty to the future, to the Party. I'd had doubts about the path I'd taken since the late 80s, when things were starting to get a bit weird. But this was the first time I came to regret what I had created.

As I sit here, retired as the High Visionary, inside the Social-Futurist World Capital(*Formerly known as Cardiff*), knowing that I have created something that cannot be controlled, cannot be stopped, and cannot be ended, I sincerely find myself hoping that when I die, I wake up again in the 1960s. Sure, people are healthy, people are safe, famines are a thing of the past in the World State, and there is a partially self-sustaining Mars colony. But there is no freedom, there are no lies, and though the world is heading for a technologically and socially progressive future that, if the recent experiments with long-range drone-based mining are to be believed, will not end until the Sun does; I find myself asking, whether it is a future worth having.

Then again, having a future is far better than having none at all.
