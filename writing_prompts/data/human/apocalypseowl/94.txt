Some days turn out just right. The sunshine is beautiful, the wind is refreshing, the traffic is light, work goes incredibly smoothly. A real amazing day to be perfectly honest. Even the boss was, well, decent, today. I even got my work done early, and had time to for a leisurely drive down to the beach for a nice walk there, before it's time to head home. I get back to my apartment, unlock the door where my cat, Cleo, is eagerly awaiting my return, doing that cat thing of rubbing up against my legs whilst nearly tripping me over as I walk inside. It's quite affectionate of her. Even the house seems a whole lot nicer. Cleaner even. Haven't really had the time recently to do much besides basic maintenance, but it almost looks like it was professionally cleaned. Guess everything does look different when you're in a good mood. Why there is even a fresh-out-of-the-oven salmon on the table, with a nice bowl of rice, some roasted asparagus, and... cold lemonade. I instinctively sit down, before remembering that I live alone in this small apartment. Who made this. There are two plates, one of which is sitting on the opposite side of the table from me. Cleo has already jumped on the table and begun nibbling at the salmon arranged on the plate opposite me.

Looking more closely around I notice that the flat doesn't just seem cleaner. It is clean. Completely and utterly scrubbed clean. There is even a light floral scent in the air. I was so wrapped up in having a nice day that I had just put down those oddities to good fortune. Looking closer at Cleo, I can tell she is tense. She doesn't like it when other strangers come into the apartment. She doesn't even particularly like humans, well, besides me. She is always like this after someone she doesn't know at all has been here longer than she likes. I don't have many friends, and I am estranged from my family for a lot of reasons. Visits happen very infrequently. I get up from the chair, causing her to look at me curiously. I should call the... no I don't want to get those incompetent bastards involved, they might shoot Cleo. Get the landlord to come out here... and do what, he's 78, nearly deaf, and frail. Lacking better options, I hold out my arms to my cat, who can be remarkably obedient at times, who promptly jumps into my arms.

And that's when I hear it. Something calling. Something from the kitchen. Of course, I recognise it, that's just the sweet voice of my dear... the train of thought that felt so alien was suddenly interrupted in my head when Cleo bit my hand. An illusion, a waking dream that I was coming home to a beloved companion, someone who was there for me, is completely and utterly shattered in an instant. The pain brings me back to reality, where I can hear what it really says. It's not words. It's... like a lure. Something that lulls you into a sense of peace and serenity. A predator. Like an anglerfish, only to people. For anglerfish only a shining light is needed to catch prey. To catch lonely humans, the promise of companionship is a far better lure. I stop for nothing, holding on to my cat I rush out of my apartment, the... thing, its horrid voice just behind me, closing in. I rush down the stairs, my cat hissing at whatever is following me. I just about get to my car, an old piece of junk, before it starts catching up to me.

I drive. As fast as possible while Cleo is holding onto my chest with her claws digging into my flesh. It hurts, but it keeps me grounded. Keeps the thing from lulling me back into its trap. Looking in the rear-view mirror I see something human shaped. But wrong. Like a living corpse, it has putrid grey-green skin where strange fleshy nodules, most of them severely necrotic, protrude from. It's horrid poisoned sweetgrass voice emanates from a maw filled with rows and rows of teeth, located where the face should have been. It has no eyes, yet it sees me. Somehow I know this. Shambling at break-neck speeds to catch up to me, I cannot seem to shake it even as I speed up to the point where it's getting downright dangerous. Seems this kind of predator doesn't let anything escape it. Its claws are long and sharp, and probably well-suited to gut its prey.

I might be a lonely man living in a world that doesn't care, but I am not going down without a fight. Holding on to the wheel with one hand, I pull the handbrake with another, and turn with a horrid sound and speed that nearly sends the car flying. But I manage it. I turn and face it head on. Instead of charging at it, I speed up and move right past it, my 2006 Honda Civic giving me everything its little motor can produce. The beast stumbles and turns to catch up with me again, as other cars give way, and pedestrians run screaming for safety. I've got an idea. It's crazy. Completely and utterly crazy. But it will work.

I arrive back at the lab where I work. It's after hours but I've got one of the cards they give to the nightshift guys. I'm often on it, so I don't know my colleagues very well, but today it's going to pay dividends, and not just in monetary terms. The thing comes at me, full force, it's horrid maw coming closer and closer to me. But I've picked up something useful. Monsters like these, in stories on the internet, can't be harmed with normal weapons. They'll shrug off bullets, heal axe and knife-wounds. But I work with a lot of dangerous stuff. A lot of it normal for medical laboratories. But still dangerous to organic tissue. First things first though. Rather than unloading hot lead upon it, like some action-hero type, I unload a fire-extinguisher straight into its maw. That's carbon-dioxide, and that's cold. On a human being it can cause frostbite or suffocation as it displaces oxygen, as far as I understand it anyhow. And I just filled its, well, insides, with it.

The thing stops dead. And collapses on the floor. I keep spraying until the entire extinguisher is empty. Only then does Cleo's claws retract from my flesh. She still holds on to me, purring loudly. Of course, the commotion has been heard by my colleagues who are on the nightshift. I ask one of them, Patricia, who I know likes and has cats herself, to hold Cleo. She does so wordlessly. I make a mental note to just pamper that cat even more than normally. She did, as a matter of fact, save my life. Of course, normally one would collapse into a heap of stress and anxiety after such a harrowing ordeal. Normally. But this is a medical laboratory. What self-respecting scientists wouldn't give at least an arm or a leg to be able to examine such an interesting, and previously undiscovered creature. Giving a text to the boss, telling him to get down here immediately, I find myself quite excited, if a little exhausted. It wanted to lure me into a trap. Possibly do something unspeakably horrible to me. Now, I get to be part of the team that does its autopsy. Funny how that works out.

It was a predator. And it thought to make me its prey. Now I will lay bare everything it is, all its secrets, all its methods. Today truly is an amazing day.
