Hiding in the darkest and most abandoned regions of the world, places where people will not go for reasons of remoteness, dangerous environmental conditions, or because they're exceptionally well hidden; there are still monsters. Strange, bizarre, and abominable creatures who could tear a man limb from limb. They congregate there, in hidden valleys, on unclimbable plateaus, in the midst of completely abandoned areas of former human habitation. Mankind might still vaguely remember them, the ghosts and vampires of our pasts. The creatures that ruled the night, who were strong and mighty when the world was young and recorded time had only just begun. Today they never leave those areas, they stay hidden in dark caves, pretend to be human if they can, just in case some strangers pass by, or flee at the mere possibility of a human coming near their hidden homes. This is strange, no? That such monsters, which in a one on one battle with a human will always come out on top. Such creatures of unimaginable horror and power, beings which cannot under the modern sciences be completely explained, who have such a hunger for the flesh of men that they cannot ever be sated; why would they ever fear their prey?

One might as well ask the wolves if they would fear the rabbits, should they come at them with fire, daggers, and traps.

Because mankind, a singular human being on their own, by their lonesome, are no match and easy prey for most of these abominable creatures; but together their might cannot be matched. In the early days, when Gilgamesh was king in Uruk, when the pyramids were being raised in lost Kemet, when the world of man was rising above what it had once been; there was war. A war waged in shadows by priests and kings against the darkness that lurked in the shadows. In old Mesopotamia the Babylonians drove out the Lilitu from their lands, and the men of Ilion awaited them with their Hittite allies in Anatolia, where that race was slaughtered to the last. The werewolves of Scythia were driven into the wild lands of Europe, before the Romans drove them to the brink of extinction. The Shoggoths once roamed the ruins of the Mohenjo-Daru, before the men that followed the Vedic scriptures burned them to ash and cinder. The true crones and warlocks, the hags and hexers of nightmares who were the spawn of demons and outcasts; they were all purged from the world by the combined might of many nations.

The Slavic people were followed by the vampires, the parasitic monsters that fed on the blood of mortal men, and before the Anointed Carpenter died upon the cross that group of horrors had already been driven deep into the hills and mountains. By the time missionaries came from fair Constantinople; the greatest city in the world in that age, the last few full-blooded vampires were butchered in a forgotten ruin somewhere in what would one day become Poland. The site is still considered holy to this day, and a great church, unknowingly, stands upon the graves of the last vampires. And that kept happening. Before written history comes to a place, the monsters are usually always scoured. Driven into extinction for their habit of feeding upon the flesh of mankind. And the stories of how the monsters end are rarely recorded anywhere. For instance, none are quite sure how the Norse cast out the Jotuns from this world, as the oral history was lost when the last of their Seiðkonur and Seiðmenn died, but the giants of old can never tread upon Midgard's soil again.

Wherever mankind spreads, no matter how far it is, the monsters are destroyed. Some might say that there should have been attempts at a better way. A less ruinous manner of living. But most monsters are just that. Monsters. Horrid creatures made either from cold primordial darkness or horrid unnatural light. They do not build. They do not grow. Most of them used to seek out mankind, in the dark days before recorded words. Before metallurgy. In Neolithic times. Only to slaughter and murder them. But mankind kept coming back. Didn't matter how many settlements were drained of blood. Didn't matter how many humans were slaughtered by werebeasts. Didn't matter how many eldritch horrors came to drag mankind into the darkness of forgotten caves to be tormented. Mankind kept coming back, and in greater numbers. And they learned. They made traps, they created better weapons, better tactics. The methods of killing monsters do not always come from the fiction that mankind made when they forgot that monsters were real. Almost as a form of genetic memory, mankind remembers what kills monsters. Like instinct, they can perceive where the dragon's heart is. Like it's been given to them with their mother's milk, they know how to stake the heart and drag the vampire into the sunlight. They remember, humanity always does in every generation on some level, how to kill the monsters.

And they could work together. Two human tribes might fight one another over land, food, resources, and a thousand different faiths. But when a monster began preying on them, they stood as one. Doesn't matter that the monster might have the strength of ten men, for hundreds throwing stones, firing poisoned arrows, jabbing with spears, will kill it. Doesn't matter if the monster has skin like stone, for traps that causes them to fall into pits with sharpened sticks, exposing their soft underbellies, will lead to their deaths. When the monster wakes at night to feast upon mankind, mankind comes in the light of day, dragging the confused beast out into the light and killing it brutally and violently. They never stop. They never give in. No matter what kind of monster mankind was ever faced with, they were brought low because mankind never stopped. It wouldn't matter if a thousand humans died to a clan of monsters, for the survivors would multiply and return stronger, wiser, and well-armed.
