This bazaar has its strange sellers and even stranger customers. People who want to buy sweet release, who want to experience that which cannot possibly be. There are merchants that sell the strangest and most odd things that one can imagine. For instance, in the House of Oddities, one can find all manner of impossible things; cat-sized elephants, a mirror that shows you your inner beauty, a sword that once drawn must shed blood or the wielder will die should they dare to place it back into its scabbard. Such are wondrous items indeed. In the Parlour of the Veiled Madame, one can find their future, pay to hear what your enemies whisper about you, and steer love(or at the very least lust), using forbidden alchemic practices. Ghartos the warlock, who practically lives in the seedy bar called the Drowned Rat, will curse anyone for the right price, and summon demons for you, though he does not guarantee that said demons are going to be willing to make a deal.

Such is the way of these places. An edge bazaar, a place where the mundane and the magic world meets. Few can find them, fewer still will know what manner of place that they have stumbled into. Of course, that is only the case for those who enter through the Coldiron Gate to such a place, which is the only gate that leads back into the mortal realm. Others lead elsewhere. The gate made from black bronze leads back to the realm of the Fae, where the eternal war between Seelie and Unseelie, Winter Court and Summer Palace, still rages. The Rust Gate leads to the iron regimes of the netherrealms, the places that mortals call Hell, though who rules there and what manner of hell people speak of, is always up for debate. Countless gates for countless worlds, leading into places where the magical and immortal races can do business. Of course, there are some mortal salesmen as well. Humanity might not be the most interesting race to deal with, and our wonders are dull in comparison to the ones others bring. But humans are good at finding a niche, and to no great surprise, most places where one can find food and drink are owned by a few cunning humans who know that no-one trusts each other, and thus find it difficult to get a good deal on a place to drink, relax, and eat.

Today however, we look at a different person than the confused humans who have blindly wandered into this place, or the few cunning ones who are making a fortune selling food that is tasty, safe, and unlikely to lead to anyone getting into trouble. We look at one of the few genuine humans who are here knowing what this place is, and what they seek. A woman, tall and gaunt, walks through the streets of this magical market, her eyes aged thousands of years longer than humans can ever live. She is well-armed, that much is obvious to any of the magical merchants, but not in an obvious way. Her clothes are baggy, and can fool most lower fae, demons, constructs, or mortal humans, but the merchants know what a person armed to the teeth looks like. A small bulge on the side of her hips when she moves is in truth a well-maintained kukri. A strange way her clothes shift when she bends over to examine a small statue of Glycon the Serpent God reveals that she has at least two machine pistols strapped to her back.

In short, this is a dangerous, and troubled person.

Most people steer clear, and the guttersnipes don't approach her. The various bards and entertainers make a point not to bother her with that infernal racket they call music. The shyster and con-men that always come to these places don't try their luck with her. They might succeed in tricking her with their illusion magics, but it would end up with them losing their heads. Some of them might survive that but they'd prefer not having to spend ages trying to find their heads. But not everyone who comes to these magical and bizarre bazaars are out merely for profit, or to trick others. Some have heart. Some have decency. The tall woman passes many stalls with amazing goods, and sits down by a large fountain. And while sitting there, she is approached by a grandmotherly figure, a good witch if there ever was one.

The woman's piercing, aged eyes, speaking of torment and horror, gazes into the very soul of the approaching witch. There is a silence over the area, as the many merchants are trying to see what will happen next, their customers also trying to figure out what is going on. The old witch reaches out her hand, and in it there is a small wooden figure of an hourglass. ''*That gaze... You must be haunted by your past. Please, take this humble trinket. It lets you replay moments from your life, letting you make different decisions.*'' The tall woman looks down upon the wooden trinket, and then back up at the kindly old witch. The woman reaches out a scarred hand, and closes the old woman's hand instead. She opens her mouth, and from it, a gutteral, pained voice emerges.

''*What happened to me, cannot be undone. What happened to me, was the result of no choices made by my own will. Yet, I thank you for the offer.*''

The kindly old witch stares at her in shock. The woman stood up, and walked away. Everyone stared at her, until she was gone. Until she walked down a dark alley, where she knew she could find what she was looking for. Vengeance. Justice. Blood. There are some forces that recruit potential members in the bazaar, like joining the Foreign Legion in the mortal world, only in a different manner. A different Legion entirely. Some would seek out the Heavenly Host and volunteer to get their humanity cut out of them, becoming living weapons in the service of Heaven. Some would seek to join the Legions of Hell, for a truly great pay, with medical benefits, and dental; just so that they could finally get to drink their fill of blood, and relish in combat the way no-one ever should. Others seek to volunteer for the Einherjar, or the Star Warriors, or even the Abyssal Horde. Everyone have their reasons, have their purpose to do so. But this woman had an unusual purpose in mind in who she sought out.

A red door opened on its own, and she entered. The long stairs led her down deep into a warm room, lit by flames.  They knew who she was. In exchange for power, and her goal fulfilled, she would allow this ancient power to reforge her soul, remake her flesh, and give her a new birth, that would make her forget. It was a price she was more than willing to pay. Vengeance. Then she would return to this chamber, and begin again. She did not need to speak. Did not need to say anything. That fire inside of her was answer enough. From walls that seemed to be made of stone-flesh, maws opened. And from them came the fire. Burning her. Burning the power into her bones and soul. She did not scream, nor flinch. It hurt, of course. But there are worse pains. Worse horrors. And she had felt them so often that this baptism in fire was merely uncomfortable in comparison.

The fire did not last forever. And she walked out of that strange red door, back into the mortal world. As there are many ways to enter the market, so are there many ways to exit. She stood before the mansion of those who had hurt her. Who had destroyed her. Who had destroyed everything she had ever dreamed of, and everyone she had ever loved. Not because of anything she had done. No, her free will had had no influence on the outcome, and what had happened to her would have always happened, and even if she could find a way to deflect what had been her fate onto someone else, she would not wish her suffering on any other human being. The guards saw her, but it was too late. Her weapons had not been damaged, as the flame was one upon her soul. But still, the kukri was searing hot as it killed them. The vast gates into the estate was nothing to her now. She ripped those massive metal gates off their hinges, and walked resolutely towards the house itself. There were more guards, but she took the flaming machine pistols from her back and fired partially melted shots into them, burning them as they fell before her. She roared with a sound unheard in the mortal world since the age of myth or the age of the dinosaurs. And forth from her mouth came a pillar of flame that torched the house before her into naught but ashes.
