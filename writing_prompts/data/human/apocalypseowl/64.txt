''*Who are you?*'' His smile widened, to an impossible degree. ''**I am ᚮᚦᛁᚿ.**'' I felt sweat on my brows. This was all wrong. I wasn't supposed to be here. ''**Your father, Zeus, knew that you would die, and his wife Hera, who hates him for very understandable reasons, would have taken out her rage on you when you died. A valiant death, defeating a terrible monster, and for that you'd get sent straight to Tartarus, next to Sisyphus and Tantalus? Not a great reward to be perfectly clear with you. Because of two bickering people who should have been divorced aeons ago. So Zeus begged me to help out. And how could I resist, this is the Hall of Heroes, where the great and valiant go. You'd be prime material for the Einherjar, the warriors chosen by the Valkyries.**'' I nodded. That made sense. I once had to defend my mother from 500 venomous snakes who were immune to fire, and were nevertheless on fire, sent by Hera. I was 10 years old at the time. She is very tired of Zeus, and his many dalliances with mortal women, or so the priests say.

''*I am honoured by your generosity, lord Odin.*'' He grinned and sat down again, becoming nothing more than an old warrior god once again. ''**Heh. I like that. There is infinite food, infinite drink, and infinite training for battle. You'll be assigned your own room by one of the elven attendants. By popular requests, there are also other activities, but the training and fighting are the most important ones. We'll need a strong warrior like you, when Ragnarok can be forestalled no longer.**'' Then, no longer noticing me, he turned to speak with his birds in hushed whispers. Between getting tormented for eternity, and this, I'm fairly certain this is preferable. One of the other warriors, a tall-looking man, put a broad hand on my shoulder. ''*Come, warrior, let's get you settled in, then Völundr and the dwarven smiths can make you a new arm.*'' He reached out his other hand and shock my remaining hand. ''*Genaíos, son of Zeus, bane of Typhon's spawn.*'' He laughed heartily and nodded eagerly. ''*Name's Sigurdr the Dragonslayer, saw you fighting from up here in one of the scrying pools. Damn good sword-work you've got there, but you could use some pointers on the legwork, then you'd still be alive, I know just the guy who can help you there.*'' I smiled, weakly, and let the strange man lead me out of the hall, and into my new life as one of the Valiant Dead, an Einherjar.
