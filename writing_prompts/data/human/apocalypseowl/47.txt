Habitable, the scientific records called it. Certainly, the atmosphere is comparable to Earth's, mostly. Breathable anyway. And it is within the Habitable Zone around its star. But our orbital telescopes weren't advanced enough to indicate much of anything. Gravity is comparable. 1.02 that of Earth. Has two moons, but due to their size and orbits, they have about the same effect on the tides as Earth's Moon. Axial tilt, so there is some seasonal variation, which is important for life on planet Earth. Of course, the whole ''ice age'' thing was something we hadn't anticipated. But there is a belt around the planet's equator which can be compared in climate to how somewhere like Magadan or Nova Scotia used to be. Surprisingly there is life. The drones sent out to take water and rock samples brought back surprising data. Primitive forms of single-celled prokaryotic lifeforms are found here. Weaker than Earth variants though. When bacteria from Earth is introduced into a controlled environment containing local single-celled lifeforms, then within 8.41 hours on average, all non-Earth bacteria have been eradicated completely.

It's only been two days since I landed here. After centuries in stasis. I thought about planting a flag when I got here. Mimicry of a great hero, who came to another heavenly sphere in peace, for all mankind. But really, the arrogance of that would be too much. This is no great step for mankind. This is not a triumph of science and the spirit of humanity. We lost the Earth. And now, to save what is left of our home, it is imperative that I take another world from whatever native life might have evolved here. Closing my eyes I can see it clearly. A world of life that will never be. Because of humanity's grave mistakes. Because we fucked up. I set the AI of the ship up to begin the finalisation of the first phase. Soon highly advanced machines will begin to build up an ozone layer around this planet. Life cannot thrive on the surface if harmful ultraviolet rays rains down upon it. While the AI, completely subservient to me as it is programmed to be, does its task diligently, I walk down to the stasis facility.

This ship has all human history, information about all human art ever made. All music ever made on record. And all books on storage as both audiobooks and written words. Of course, it contains no mentions of all our errors. Of our grave mistakes. Casually while I look at the storage bay containing the samples of insectile lifeforms, I check out the library. All the great stories and good ideas we've ever had. And all the bullshit and lies we've ever written. All the toxic and horrid nightmares that we used as justifications for our selfish deeds. All the mistakes we've ever made. Makes my stomach churn with anger. With wrath. With a hunger for justice. But there is only one human being left. And she's got a job to do. It will take years for the AI to finish setting up the ozone layer. But in the meantime, a protective domed area should be used to set up an base of operations where human life can be re-established.

The dome is set up by countless worker drones, optimised for actually working as they are supposed to, for centuries at least. No planned obsolescence allowed here. If we'd done that back on Earth, maybe we'd still have one. Several of the storage bays are activated, setting out simple and hardy life at first. Lichens and the likes. I oversee everything from my command-centre aboard the *Gaia's Resurgence*, a name that only barely beat out *Arky McArkface* on the popularity poll. Earth was dying, but sure enough, we were still that stupid. Mankind was mostly sterile, full of microplastics, and frankly close to extinction. We should have made as many of these as we could. But that would have been too much for the economy, too expensive. Which leads one to wonder who would care about the economy when we'd all be dead. What manner of wealth would matter if there would be no life to covet it? It is just as well that all the leaders, elites, and other rich parasites were already too sick to survive the trip in stasis. Imagine them starting all over with the same horrid errors. The same corporate stupidity, the same greed, and disregard for life? We'd be jumping from world to world across the galaxy, polluting them until they died, then moving on. Like a race of parasites.

I was the only one healthy enough to survive the trip. Pure luck really, the doctors said. I was one of the last humans who weren't full of poisons, cancers, and other horrors. And the only one who was already trained in spaceflight. Now I have the dubious honour of being the last human in the universe. I set down real parasites that are necessary for the environment, insects, various forms of flora, and fungal life. Slowly but surely establishing Earth's nature here on another world. With the eventual goal of unfreezing human embryos and grow them in the artificial wombs, remaking humanity. At least there, I can take some pleasure in knowing that only the best of the best were chosen. The most healthy humans, with the best chances of survival, gave their genetic material to ensure that there would be a future for our species. As the automated processes take over the seeding of the large region kept safe, I head through the five kilometre long and one kilometre wide ship towards the storage area where the future of mankind is kept. There were only enough healthy humans left to supply 50k embryos that are not closely related, to prevent any genetic issues. But that's still enough to rebuild mankind. To create a brighter new tomorrow, where we've learned from our mistakes on Earth.

The loss of Earth will not be repeated. Not today, not ever. Mankind has the potential for greatness in it, I know this in my bones, and now we will prove it. I will be the mother of a civilisation. Which is not something that I ever expected to happen. It is not something most people ever get the chance to consider. I am a little scared, to be honest. Who wouldn't be? The reconstruction of human civilisation, on the shoulders of one woman, it is a little much. But as I open the doors into the storage bay, I know I will do everything I can to lead mankind to a future, where the old lies and shames will not lead us. I will do my very best. I head to the computer terminal inside the bay, and begin to check the inventory. All seems to be in order. 99.8% of the embryos should be viable after the long centuries of travel. There is something odd though. There seems to be a slight glitching of the system. This was to be expected, our computers are not meant to operate for centuries without maintenance. But it seems that the viable number of embryos keep jumping. 99% to 58% to 0.78% to 32.33%, and so on. According to the manual about the computers, this is probably just a simple case of an internal sensor that needs adjustment. I'll have to open the storage containers to fix that. Not that it is dangerous right now, but in the long run it might have a slight negative effect on the embryos.

I put in the administrator codes to Embryo-Container-01. Each of them can contain about 5000 embryos each. And we've got all ten of them. I open the door and notice that indeed the internal sensor is slightly malfunctioning. I then turn my head to stare at the embryos for a bit. And scream in agony, shock, and rage. There are no embryos in this container. There is however, a man who has very clearly died while in stasis. And I recognise the man. It's one of the leading members of the Corporate Council. The organisation of corporations who had as much or more power than nation-states. The arrogance, to try to survive like this, at the cost of mankind! Even though the doctors said that there was less then 2.3% chance of anyone else surviving! And to use a retrofitted Embryo-Container, which was never meant to be used for a grown human, what the hell? Fear grips me. And I open the other Embryo-Containers. Each one opened makes my heart sink. There is a dead man or woman in each of them. Leading CEOs and shareholders. The richest people on Earth.
