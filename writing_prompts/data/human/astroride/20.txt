##Recoil

"Okay that's enough." Tyler catches his breath and tries to remove the VR simulator. "I don't want to buy a weapon today."

"Ah, but your list included the skin-peeler 3000. We still need to stimulate that one." Peter presses the simulation button and watched Tyler scream.

"Oh my god, that was worse one yet. Please just erase my entire list."

"Nope, according to store protocols, if you order more than fifteen items, your list can't be erased. We have to go through every single one of them. You ordered forty items; that was number eleven."

"I've learned my lesson."

"Ooh, you'll certainly learn it now. The next weapon is the heart-stopper. This'll take a few minutes." Peter opens a bag of chips and watches. Tyler feels the sensation of having a heart arrhythmia. He begins to sway in his chair and throws up on the floor which the machines quickly clean. After it's done, he gasps for air.

"Why didn't you tell me this when I bought it?"

"We're not supposed to. This program is meant to discourage violence. Also, it's fun."

Tyler pauses for several seconds. "Wait, did you say it was fun?"

"Yeah, this is probably the best part of my job."

"So you enjoy torturing people with the VR. Have you ever had it used on you?"

"No, why would I? It's not a weapon."

"It causes me a lot of pain. I'd say it's a weapon." The VR system shakes on Tyler's head.

"Oh crap. I didn't mean to say I enjoyed it." The VR headset detaches from Tyler and flies through the air. Peter tries to run from it, but it catches up and attaches to him.

"No, please, have mercy." Tyler gets behind the counter.

"You didn't show me mercy." Tyler looks at the remaining weapons to use on Peter. "Let's try the finger-remover."

"Noooo," Peter yells.
