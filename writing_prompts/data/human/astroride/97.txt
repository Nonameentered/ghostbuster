##Heather's Hole in the Wall

Bumps emerge from the ground at dusk. The once smooth sidewalk becomes uneven and difficult terrain. Walking speeds slow to crawl. The purpose is to dissuade anyone from walking late at night. The night is when criminals take the streets; removing the streets will solve the problem. That’s the justification for all of the Planners’ decisions. It’s to prevent crime.

Valerie’s Tavern was more than a pub; it served as the heart of the community. When work was done, friends gathered to drink, play, and sing songs. Their melodies were never synchronized, and people laughed at failures more than successes. But they did it together.

Its doors are now surrounded by spikes. Getting past requires turning to the side and holding arms in the air. It stands in opposition to the original intent. The only people who would attempt to overcome such obstacles are immediately placed under constant surveillance. Too many pubs have been meeting places for groups that attempted to overthrow the Planners.

A few blocks past Valerie’s Tavern is the replacement known by the name Heather’s Hole in the Wall. Heather is Valerie’s great-granddaughter, and she has been continuing the mission of creating a space free of the impediments in her basement. Flowers line the walls of the room with abstract art above it. The lights are dim and frequently change colors. Most importantly, people disregard the social norms imposed on them. They talk freely about their desires and joys. There is one thing missing from the space. Discussions of open rebellion.

The Planners tolerate the Hole in the Wall because they are aware they cannot control their citizenry all the time. The Hole in the Wall allows people to release their hedonistic desires in short controlled bursts. This dissuades them from wanting to change society to allow them to do that with more frequency. When that idea enters a few minds, Heather is quick to suppress it herself. She will not allow her sanctuary to be destroyed. 

I wish that there was a place where there were no restrictions. I wish that there was  a place where the community could come together and celebrate each other. I wish that someone would come and free us from this shithole. But I know that someone will never come. So I sit alone in this basement drinking to forget the hell I’m in.
