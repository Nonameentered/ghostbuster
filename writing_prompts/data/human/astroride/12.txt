##Wedding Dusk Blues

I am always satisfied with the best so why is life no longer satisfying. 

Kaitlyn is dancing and charming the attendees with the poise and grace that I’ll never acquire. One of the many benefits to being born into this world. It’s my garden that’s holding the reception, but she decorated it to satisfy the tastes of the upper-class. She stands at the back of the gala in her white dress and lets the sunset surround her. The photographers are quick to capture this image to properly convey her elegance and glamor.

If it weren’t for my money, she wouldn’t have married me. I wouldn’t have married her if she couldn’t provide me access to the world of those born rich. My bank account is orders of magnitude larger than anyone in attendance, but they view it all as illusory. I’m nothing more than a pig with bougie clothes and a private jet to them.

Men and girls come and go like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars. None bother to make the ten foot trek to where I sit. The only congratulations I received were from Kaitlyn’s parents, and those were quite muted. 

I shouldn’t have expected more. While making the guest list, Kaitlyn narrowed down my invites to just my parents and brother. No extended family and certainly no friends were allowed. I strongly think that if my brother wasn’t my best man he wouldn’t have been invited. All of my groomsmen were her cousins, and she wanted her brother to be the best man.

I asked for her reasons, and she said that inviting my family would be a disaster. They’d wander around in a desultory fashion and embarrass themselves. Looking at my parents sitting miserable and alone, I understand where she could get that notion, but would it have been that bad if other people they knew were here.

My entire life was spent acquiring wealth and influence. All of my material desires would be met within an instant. Now, I am surrounded by the symbols of the power, and I see how illusory they are. I am lonely in this pile of opulence.
