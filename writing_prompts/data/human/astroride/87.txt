##Sheriff's Past

Judd stares at me with glee in his eyes, and I stare back with disgust. The surrounding townspeople hide in terror; a few are hoping that I win. The greedy pigs that make up the majority of New Aurum are apathetic. As sheriff, I have to make sure there's some semblance of order here.

"Before we begin." His voice is naturally nasally, but he lowers it to sound tough. "I have one question? Have you ever been to Baltimore?"

"Uhh." I widen eyes and grab my gun. I came here to run away from my past. "No, is it a good city?"

"I don't know. I've never been, but I've heard that you have. How about Cleveland, Lexington, or Milwaukee? Those are booming cities." Judd does a small dance as he speaks. Other people stare at me out of curiosity.

"Nope, I'm a simple country boy from Vermont."

"What? You told me you were from Virginia," Doug says.

"I heard Georgia."

"I heard Maine."

The people around me are starting to compare notes about my past that I told them. My face turns red.

"Listen. We've all done things we ain't proud of. Isn't that why we came out here?"

"No, I came here for gold." Someone yells. The entire town mumbles in agreement.

"And you and I both came here to get rich off of people with gold, or do you not do that anymore?" Judd asks.

"I've got no clue what you're talking about," I say.

"What is he talking about?" Megan says. I drop my gun and run to Judd.

"Alright, who sent you? Was it the Pinkertons?" I whisper.

"Nope." He grabs my shirt and pulls me close. "My mother is Jane Rudolf. She was one of your first victims back in Delaware, and she started the fund to arrest you."

"Wait, are you my son?" I ask. Judd looks at me in disgust.

"No, she didn't tell me that part, and I wish you didn't."

"Okay, are you sure? I'd feel guilty about almost shooting my boy."

"You are not my father, but that's not the point." Judd pushes me away. "The point is that he was a massive con artist east of the Mississippi." He holds out his hands and yells. "He sold forgeries stole from people, and heavily extorted people. In some cases, he even killed his mark to prevent them from going to the police. He's wanted in nearly every major city, and you all made him your sheriff."

"Wait a minute, you approached me about creating a bank. Were you trying to gather our money to steal it." Mr. Hedges stands up. I start to sweat.

"Uh, no." I run from Judd and get on my horse. "Giddy up." Judd shoots after me. Soon, other people join him. Bullets hit the sand beside me, but none of them hit. No one chases me so after a few minutes; I'm safe.

I get off my horse to evaluate what little supplies I have. Damn Judd. I had a good scheme prepared. Now I'm going to have to go somewhere else to do it. What happened to honor among thieves.
