##Disagreement/Compromise

Mike smiles in a futile attempt to make James and Emma comfortable. They are seated close to each other, but they're leaning away. If no one was watching, one of them would quickly move to another part of the room. 

"Well, I like to start this process in a very freshman orientation fashion. Please tell me your name and one of your hobbies. My name is Mike, and I'm an avid fisherman. I go fishing every weekend if I can down on Horseshoe Lake," Mike says.

"I'm Emma." She hesitates with her words. "And I guess I like cooking."

"What do you cook?" Mike asks.

"Uh, I try to bake a variety of foods. I would like to bake vegetarian meals, but." Emma looks at James. "I'll drop it actually."

"Okay, how about you?" Mike asks James.

"I'm James, and I would like to play poker. Emma won't let me," James says.

"James, why'd you have to say that?" Emma asks.

"May as well get to the point. You implied the same things about me."

"Do you two mind if I step in." The couple cease their bickering. James slouches. "I'm sorry that I clearly hit a nerve, but this gives me a good place to start. Why don't you both say what you would like to do. Please don't accuse the other of holding you back. Focus on your own feelings."

"I want to play poker more. We never play with real money, and if we do, it's twenty bucks tops," James says.

"And I want to cook more vegetarian meals. Vegetarian food is healthier. Plus, the way animals are treated is disturbing to me," Emma says.

"Okay, so now both of you state your objects about the other's behaviors. Please do it politely" Mike leans close and folds his hands before him.

"I don't like gambling. As far as I see it, people have lost their livelihoods to it."

"And I just don't like vegetarian food. It's just salads and tofu." 

"Okay." Mike nods his head. "With disagreements like these, it's important to compromise or at least consider the other person's perspective. James, I don't know if this has been discussed, but there's meat substitutes."

"Too expensive," James says.

"Don't interrupt." Emma holds out her arms.

"It's fine. Alright, meat substitutes are expensive, but there's beans. Also, you don't have to go full vegetarian. You could just do it once a week to start." James turns to Emma. "As far as poker, some people would say video games are a waste of money. We all have our ways of entertaining ourselves. It's important to make sure that you still have a savings account and that you can meet your needs."

"I guess your right." Emma rubs the back of her head.

"I agree."

"That's good. We have a nice start here. Fixing a marriage is a process, but it always starts with compromise."
