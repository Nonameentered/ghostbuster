##Clap If You're in Pain

Human's heart rate rises in dark areas. Even if it is familiar as one's bedroom. Each step could be the last. Danger hides in the darkness. Children are wise for being afraid of-

"Ow." I jump on my left as I feel a sharp pain in my right foot. When I clap my hands, the lights reveal a thumb tack on the floor. My foot is bleeding at the heel. I begin to hop out to get a band-aid when a clap comes from under the bed and turns the lights off.

I clap my hands to turn the lights back on. "Bogle, I need to get a band-aid for my foot."

"And I told you that the light hurts me." He claps his hands.

"I know that, but my foot is in pain. Suck it up." I clap.

"Why don't you suck up the pain from your foot." He claps.

"You're supposed to be an all-powerful demon lord that brings nightmares, and you're afraid of a little light." I clap. Bogle pauses for several seconds.

"It's not pain. It is damage to my existential being, but I'm stronger. So I'll let you get a band-aid on," he says. I walk out of the room to put a band-aid on the wound. When I return the room, Bogle immediately claps his hands.

"I need to pick up the pin so I don't step on it again." I clap my hands.

"Just get on your hands and knees and look." Bogle claps.

"What if it stabs my hands?" I clap.

"I let you have the last round, but you have to do it this time." Bogle claps.

"But you're the-"

"Don't say it." 

"Fine." I sigh and get on my knees.

Strange objects hide in the dark. Objects possess a sense of mystique because one can't go smelling shapes or colors. It could be perfectly harmless, but one would never know. Is anyone willing to take the chance-

"Found it." I grab the pin and walk to the trash can next to my bed. 

"Ow. You dropped it on my hand," Bogle says.

"I'll get you a band-aid if you turn the lights back on," I reply.

"I will fight through the pain. It's a minor prick compared to what I've inflicted on mortals." I hear a clang as Bogle throws it in the trash. 

"Suit yourself." I shrug and hop into bed.

What lies under the bed is a mystery. It could be nothing, or it could be your worst nightmare. It might've been empty when the lights are on, but when in the dark, evil awaits. It taps its fingers biding for the perfect time to strike.

"Bogle, stop monologuing. I'm trying to sleep," I say.

"Sorry."
