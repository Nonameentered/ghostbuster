##A Mundane Reality

"Daniel, could you see me during lunch?" Mr. Anderson asks in a low voice away from the other kids.

"Okay." Daniel shrugs. It isn't like he has anything better to do. He always eats alone, and Mr. Anderson is one of the few teachers that Daniel tolerates. He makes it through the next few periods without issue and grabs a chicken tenderloin at lunch. In the classroom, Mr. Anderson is sitting with a small stack of papers in his hands.

"These fell out of your notebook on your way out of class." He passes the typed pages to Daniel. Daniel reads the first line.

*Sleep is a lot like death.*

"Oh crap." Daniel's eyes widen.

"Normally, I would applaud creating your own spin on classic literary works, but this is disturbing," Mr. Anderson says.

"It's just a way for me to process what I go through." Daniel slams the stack of papers on Mr. Anderson's desk. "Do you know how shitty my peers are?"

Mr. Anderson raises an eyebrow. "I am aware of the cruelty of kids."

"Adriana is always spreading a new rumor about me because it's funny to her. That's why I had bats eat her mouth and ears. Greg is always pushing me during gym class so I lit his arms on fire. Mrs. Drexel ignores everything that happens in her class so I had her blind and riding in a firey windstorm." Daniel cries. "And Brian used to be my best friend, but he betrayed me for popularity."

"Mrs. Drexel is the worst," Mr. Anderson shrugs. Daniel laughs.

"I thought teachers were supposed to be united?" Daniel asks.

"Oh, we're not. We just present that front for students. Everyone thinks Mrs. Drexel is more concerned about being popular with her students than teaching. Once, I was paired with her as a chaperone on a field trip to the local park. I spent the entire time supervising both of our classes because she ran off with the cool kids. It was a nightmare." Mr. Anderson holds up a finger. "Don't tell anyone that I told you that."

"It's fine. As long as you won't tell Tristan that I like her," Daniel says.

"You like Tristan? I didn't know that."

"Uh yeah, it's why she's one of my guides." Daniel blushes. "I thought it would be obvious."

"I'm sorry. That was a lame attempt at a joke. I figured out your attraction, seeing as you put her in the same category as Ryan Reynolds."

"Oh, that was a good joke." Daniel forces a laugh and rubs the back of his head. "So I am in trouble?"

"You're not in trouble for now. I could tell this was a way to vent, but what if I wasn't the person who picked it up? What if it was Adriana?" Mr. Anderson asks.

"Oh god, that would be horrible." Daniel takes the pages in his hands and rips them.

"Okay, that was rather rash, but my point still stands. Do you have someone you could talk to about this?" 

"Nope, my mom is too busy gushing over my older brother to care about me, and my dad frequently misses his weekends with me," Daniel says.

"Hmm, that's a shame." Mr. Anderson scratches his chin. "Because they're missing out on genuine talent."

"Seriously?" Daniel leans forward. "I mean I'm not that good."

"You're twelve years old. Not exactly William Faulkner, but I see something amazing in you. Let's make a deal. Every Monday, you turn in a short story to me. I'll give you comments on Wednesday. Because I know how hard it is to get kids to do homework. I'll have this count towards your character points for the end of year trip to the amusement park." Mr. Anderson holds out a hand. "Deal."

"Deal." Daniel smiles and shakes Mr. Anderson's hand.
