##Hole in the Desert

I tossed all your shit into a hole in the desert. You can look for days, but you'll never find it. I don't even remember where I put it. Nothing was accomplished, and it didn't make me feel better. I did it anyway.

Maybe you can ask Danielle to get you a new watch. Stacy could get a good discount on a new suit. And I'm sure Linda wouldn't mind buying you a new pair of shoes or four new pairs. Don't worry. I didn't tell them about each other; they'll have to find out like I did.

For a few seconds, I blamed myself for falling for your bullshit. You were charming in an awkward sort of way, but you knew the exact moment to be suave. Somehow, you knew all the best spots in town. I never felt so amazing, but I guess you've a lot of practice making people feel that way.

If you're thinking of apologizing, I won't accept it. Let's just go our separate ways. I hope you have a happy life, and I hope that I'm not in it at all. When I tossed your shit into that hole, I threw my heart in with it.
