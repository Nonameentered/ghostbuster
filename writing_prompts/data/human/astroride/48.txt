##No Secrets

International relations are in turmoil. A few countries have already declared war. Cities have descended into anarchy. Friends become enemies. Families are torn apart. Secrets have been revealed. With the digital thumbprint website active, everyone's true self has been revealed.

"What do you have say for yourself?" Mariah walks in with her hands on her hips. Jane looks up with a blank expression and shrugs.

"About what?"

"Don't lie. I saw your browser history and texts," Mariah says.

"Okay. Is it about the text message to my mom where I said you were moody?" Jane blinks. Mariah shakes her head.

"No, it's because you were exactly how you normally are." Mariah sits down and starts crying. Jane rubs her. "I'm sorry for yelling at you. I'm more mad at myself."

"I don't understand," Jane says.

"Did you look at my history?" Mariah asks.

"No, I figured you'd reveal anything important eventually," Jane smiles, "Otherwise, I don't care."

"See. How can you just not care? What if I vented frustrations to my mother like you did?"

"Then, you are perfectly valid for doing that. I know I can be a difficult partner sometimes because I don't act like other people," Jane says.

"That's just it. That's why I like you. You are so upfront and blunt. Meanwhile, I can be so two-faced and bitchy."

"You're not two faced." Jane kisses her. "If you were, I'd kiss both of your faces."

"That was a terrible joke."

"I don't care," Jane shrugs, "It's true. I love you because of all the great moments we've had together. I know we've had bad times, and if I look at your thumbprint, it would just reopen old wounds. It'd be pointless, but I understand why you looked at mine. It's okay."

"What did I do to deserve you?" Mariah asks.

"Nothing. We don't deserve each other. We chose each other out of love." A helicopter crashes outside their window. "Now, let's go to the panic room. We should have enough rations for six months."

"Do you thinks this'll blow over in that timeframe?"

"I don't know, but I'll enjoy those six months alone with you." Mariah kisses Jane, and they walk to the panic room.
