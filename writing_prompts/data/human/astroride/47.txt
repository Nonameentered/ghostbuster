##The Grim Agent

Someone steps on the back of Ian's cloak and trips, spilling beer on him. 

"Sorry bro, let me take care of that." He begins moving his hand on Ian's back. Ian turns and swats the man away. The cowboy jumps back and accidentally dumps the rest of his beer on Ian's chest.

"Oh no, are you going to take my soul for that?" The man has a goofy smile. Ian stands in silent. "Oh, you forgot your scythe so you can't do it. I got you."

Ian sighs and nods his head. 

"Good job staying in character." The cowboy pats Ian's shoulder and leaves. 

Why did this assignment have to occur on Halloween? On the surface, everyone is in costume allowing for a quick and easy disguise. Unfortunately, the target is also disguised, and everyone is inebriated and swaying creating opportunities for the plan to go awry. 

The most recent intelligence suggests that the target will be dressed as a pirate. She could've changed costumes at the last minute, but the pirate is a good starting point. A woman in a blue jacket walks past him. Ian slips closer and realizes that she's dressed a founding father.  Wood taps the floor to his right. Ian looks out of the corner of his eye to see a Groot costume.

"Argh, matey." He turns to find the source of the noise. The pirate is standing at the back of the bar talking to a viking. The woman is wearing a black wig and an eyepatch, but she is clearly the target. After pulling out a carton of cigarettes, she indicates that she's going outside. Ian smiles as he follows her.

The parking lot is full, and only two of the ten streetlights work. The light beside the door glows orange. Ian shivers in his cloak. The night is quite cold which explains the lack of people outside. Except for the missing pirate.

"Hands up." Ian feels a gun pressed to his neck. The target stands behind her. A car in the parking lot turns on. "That's where we're going." She presses the back of his neck, and he moves with her. The cowboy who spilled beer on him is in the driver's seat, and a soldier holding a gun is in the back. The passenger back door is opened. The pirate pushes Ian into the back seat. The pirate gets in the passenger seat, and they start to move away from the bar.

"Did you really think I'd be that stupid?" the pirate asks.

Ian responds by tapping the side of his cloak. Poison gas is emitted from his cloak filling the car. Everyone else chokes; Ian is wearing a gas mask under his skull mask. The cowboy swerves and crashes the car. In the confusion, Ian injects the three captors with more poison to ensure the task is complete. He walks out of the car into the night, having completed his role as the grim reaper.
