##Price of Boredom

A small metal tin lies in the box from my brother. A sticky note that says "GENIE LAMP!!!!" is on it. I chuckle. That joke is juvenile even for him. I pull it out and rub it as a joke. Green smoke emerges from the lamp.

"Hmm, that's a cool trick. Wonder how he did it." The smoke materializes into a man before my eyes. He comes up to my chest, and he's completely hairless even lacking eyebrows. His skin is a multicolored scaled mess with littler patterns detectable, and his eyes are bright green.

"Make your first wish." His voice is deep enough that I can feel it in my chest. 

I grab my hair thinking. This wasn't supposed to be real. Why didn't my brother write a full note instead of a sticky note. I should've prepared for this. What if there's a time limit. Oh god, he could go back into his lamp at any moment.

"I wish for a million dollars," I say.

"Really, that little." His voice cracks into a higher tone, and he shakes his head. "You could've asked for a billion dollars or a trillion dollars. Why'd you go so low?"

"Okay, can I have a more money?"

"Too late idiot." He points his finger at his stomach. "You now have tapeworm."

"What the hell." I pull up my shirt to see something moving under my skin. "Why'd you do that?"

"You got it from the restaurant you ate last night. You'll sue them and win a million dollars plus medical and legal expenses because I'm feeling generous," the genie says.

"But, but, you gave me a tape worm. This is so gross. Plus, I won't get that money for a year," I say.

"Not my problem." The genie shrugs. "Next wish." His voice deepens again. 

This time, I rub my chin to think of exact wording. This genie clearly enjoys toying with mortals. If I'm going to beat him, I need to play his game. Which means that I will need to be specific about my wish.

"I wish the love of my life would appear at my door in the next ten seconds," I say.

"You humans are so needy. I want to meet someone who will make me happy." The genie bobs his head in a nasally voice. "Just learn how to be good on your own. No one asks me how I'm doing in my lantern, and I one time spent a decade in there."

"Are you going to grant my wish or not?"

"It's already done. Open it up." I turn and walk down the hall. When I open the door, a beagle puppy is wagging its tail on the other side. I pick the dog up and bring it to him.

"I meant human love, but this is nice." The puppy licks my hand. "But this is nice."

"Might I suggest Wefamnweifkc. It was my mother's name." I blink at the genie.

"Uh, I'll just name her Bella." I look at the puppy. "Wait a minute, does this puppy have rabies or something?"

"Of course not, I'm not a total monster. I'm just bored. You'll absolutely love her. Besides." The genie looks around my house. "This place could use a bit of life into it. It's absolutely disgusting."

"You're not so bad after all," I smile at Bella. The downsides to these wishes aren't that bad. In the long run, my life will be a lot better off. Maybe I don't need to overthink my last wish.

"I wish for a bigger house," I say.

"Wow, you are so selfish. Me me me. Not one of your wishes was about world peace or ending disease. Just how can I make myself happy. For that, here's how'll give you a bigger house." The genie snaps his fingers. The walls collapse as a semitruck enters the room. I dive protecting Bella. When the semitruck stops, I see the damage left behind.

"I really should've seen that one coming," I say.
