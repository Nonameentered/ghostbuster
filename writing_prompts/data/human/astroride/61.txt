##Human Cheese Experiment

The horn blares from the intercom. Two slices of cheese emerge from the wall. When I work toward them, I watch every step before me. No harm comes to pass. I sniff the air around the cheeses in the hope of a small hint. Nothing is obvious so I grab the cheese on the right. An electric shock is sent through my body from the collar around my neck.

"You should've looked at the sulfur around it," Doug says through the intercom. I pick up the cheese. A small black circle surrounds it.

"How was I supposed to see that?" I yell. I'm shocked again.

"Remember. Be respectful. Put the cheese back to restart the experiment." 

Gritting my teeth, I move to set it down. Before I do, I bring it to my mouth to take a bite. Doug shocks me again.

"No, put it back. No food until you guess right." I place the wheel back on the table. When I move to my spot, the cheese is sent back in the wall. 

Tapping my feet, I hear the gears and people move behind the wall. They often repeat tests, but they never do the same one in a row. I have to be alert for anything. The horn blasts again, and the cheeses emerge. 

My feet tingle slightly. Closing my eyes, I listen to the floor. There's a slight vibration from the tiles, and I have to figure out the right path. This was my least favorite test. There has to be a way out. I open my eyes and smile when I realize it.

Purposefully stepping on the wrong tile, I grit my teeth as electricity moves through me. In ten seconds, I fall on the floor.

"Get up, Emma. That was awful," Doug says. I lie on the floor. He shocks me again. "Come on, Emma. Get up."

After the last shock, he waits a few minutes. "Emma are you alright." I lie on the floor.

A door open underneath my feet. A young man in a white jump suit runs to me. He lifts up my head and takes off my collar.

"Emma, please tell me you're alright? I didn't mean to kill you," he says. I grab the collar and put it around his neck. He shoves me to the ground. "What the hell?" He grabs at the collar to pull it off, but he get shocked.

"Not so fun is it?" I stand laughing. He looks at the intercom.

"Please get this collar off of me," he yells.

"The rules are clear. No mercy to the subjects," a different voice says, "Emma, would you like to oversee the new test subject?"

I look at Doug and smile, "Gladly."
