##The Erstung

The arrow flies from my hands as the bird scatter. Feathers cover the area obscuring my vision. A pained chirp reveals that my aim was true. 

I run closer to see the arrow pierced the wing of a small bird. It would almost certainly die no matter what I did. Unfortunately, I could never claim it as my Erstung; it would bring dishonor. The start of being a man should be marked with glory and revelry.

 Five years ago, Gunther had retrieved a slightly larger blue jay for his Erstung. The festival was filled with mockery and shame. There were rumors that his father would disown him. That didn't formally happen, but his earlier adulthood has certainly been marked by challenges. 

The sun still shines bright overheard, but it's beginning its descent. There is certainly enough time, but I've always been naturally anxious. It is a trait that I hope to lose in adulthood. I slap my face to remind myself that adulthood starts soon. If I'm going to acquire virtues or lose vices, I must begin them now. My worries must be pushed aside, and I must focus on the task at hand.

Bending over, I move through the woods as a gentle breeze. The branches bend but not break when I hit them. The squirrels run through my legs. Leaves collect on my shoulders to provide more cover.

A snap behind me indicates a new kill. Quickly turning, I draw my bow and prepare to fire. A deer is eating on the far end of my normal range but not impossible. With steady hands, I focus on the spot behind the shoulder for a quick kill. Yet wouldn't this be an average Erstung.

I wouldn't receive derision, but there would be no praise. Every boy dreams of bringing a bear for his Erstung. The men are quick to dissuade these ambitions. Ten men would be needed to carry it back to our village. The kill would require twice the amount of arrows in my quiver. 

But the praise it would bring. I would be declared an Zahlgraf on the spot. My inheritance would increase tenfold. The Altders would look to me for guidance. Tales of my accomplishments would be passed through the generations.

No. I shake my head. These are the thoughts of a boy fantasizing about the future. Being a man requires accepting reality and learning to work within its confines. An Erstung proves my value to the village. The deer contains enough meat for several mouths. Admiration won't come with it, but it will bring respect. Respect can be nurtured.

The deer lifts it head, and I let go of my arrow. It hits its target. The deer leaves a trail of blood as it runs. I follow until it collapses. Grabbing its legs, I begin my journey back to my village as a man.
