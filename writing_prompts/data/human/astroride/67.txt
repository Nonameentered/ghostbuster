##Freshman Board Game Meeting

"I can't believe we're wasting the day doing this." Julie puts her head in her hands.

"Do you have something better to do?" Tyler asks.

"No, and that's what makes it worse," Julie says.

"Come on, big money." Charlie rolls the dice. "One, two, three damnit."

He falls back twenty spaces. Alyssa takes the dice away and rolls a five. She moves to a ladder that leads four away from the last space.

"You're about to win your third game. How are you so lucky?" Charlie asks.

"Luck has nothing to do with it! It's all skill," Alyssa says.

"But this is snakes and ladders. It's based entirely on a die roll," Charlie says.

"I wish our dorm had better games." Julie hands Tyler a dollar. "Could you get me a bag of chips from the vending machine?"

"No, I want to watch this," Tyler says. Julie shrugs and stands to get herself a bag of chips. 

"Exactly, I know how to manipulate the die with my hands." Alyssa picks up the die and shakes it. "This will be a three." She tosses the die. It bounces several times and lands on a three. 

"Bullshit, you got lucky." Charlie picks up the die and shakes it. "This will be a two." When he lets go of the die, it lands on four.

"You didn't do it right."

"Is there actually a way to control die rolls?" Tyler asks.

"Of course, my dad taught it to me when I was a child," Alyssa says.

"I believe it." Julie sits down and eats her chips.

"Why?" Tyler asks.

"I don't know. It felt like the right thing to say."

"What did your dad to for a living?" Charlie asks.

"Professional crabs player. I thought about following in his footsteps, but I decided to be a surgeon instead," Alyssa says.

"Are you sure you made the right choice?" Julie asks.

"I ask myself that everyday." Alyssa shakes her head. Tyler and Julie glance at each other.

"There's no way someone could be a professional crabs player. They would either lose a lot of money or get kicked out of the casino eventually," Charlie says.

"Oh, that happened a lot. It's why I always moved as a kid," Alyssa says.

"Aha, so your dad was cheating."

"He would never. He was an honest man who just figured out how to make the dice roll what he wanted." 

"I wonder if that counts as cheating?" Tyler asks.

"The rules of a casino are arbitrary," Julie says.

"That's true," Tyler says.

"No, it's not. Casinos should be a place of harmony like snakes and ladders. A place where people can come and test their skills. Luck may be involved but only to those who don't understand the game." Alyssa picks up the die. "Soon, you'll be able to learn how to control it too. This will be a one." She rolls the die, and it comes up a six.

"Okay, I'm so hyped up that I screwed up. This will be a one." The result is a three. "It will be a one." A two comes up. "This will be a one." Another six appears. Charlie relaxes. Julie laughs between chips, and Tyler leans back.

"It looks like your luck has finally run out," Charlie says.

"No, I have skill." She keeps rolling the die to no avail. "What is happening?"

"This is just sad," Julie says.

"Want to go to my room and watch a bad movie to laugh at?" Tyler asks.

"Are you going to yawn as an excuse to put your arm around me because that's clich√©," Julie says.

"Uh, I wasn't planning on it." Tyler rubs the back of his neck.

"Good, you should just put your arm around me." Julie says. Tyler smiles, and the two walk off. Alyssa continues failing to roll a one. Charlie picks up the die and rolls a one on the first try.

"How'd you do that? What's your technique?" she asks.

"Skill has nothing to do with it. It's all luck," Charlie smiles.
