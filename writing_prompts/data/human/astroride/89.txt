##Other End of the Line

It was a wrong number that started it, the telephone ringing three times in the dead of night, and the voice on the other end asking for someone he was not.

“Hi, is Dave there?” The voice was rehearsed and cold.

“No, this is Henry.”

“Oh, that’s too bad. Maybe you could help me. I represent Columbia Cutting, and we have some products that you might be interested in.” Henry hung up the phone and threw it against the wall. The phone survived, but the screen cracked. The caller would’ve bloviated for hours if allowed. 

It was not a fragrant world. There were calls in the middle of the night waking people from their sleep to sell a new credit card. They could be avoided by ignoring calls that he didn’t know. But that would be the easy way, and Henry didn’t like doing things the easy way.

He put his gun in his garters and placed his best tie around his neck. His trenchcoat clutched him like a warm embrace. After putting on his fedora, he was ready to solve the mystery.

Sitting at his computer, he began searching for information about Columbia Cutting. His computer keys made typewriter noises to add to the ambience, but they added little to his search. He was on the fifth page of his results and was coming up empty handed.  He thought about clicking again, but would it be worth it? He had already scoured much further than any other man would be willing to go.

He scratched his chin thinking of a way to narrow his results. Inspiration struck him like lightning to a lightning rod. He made a note to himself to improve his imagery skills as he typed Dave behind Columbia Cutting. 

The first result was a forum where people complained about getting similar calls. These monsters were everywhere. On the second page of discussion, one person posted the contact information of the company so others could harass them. As luck would have it, they were a few blocks away from Henry.

People had a tendency to keep their distance from Henry. Maybe they could tell that he was on serious business. Or maybe it was because he hadn’t showered in a week. Either way, he was alone, and he liked it that way. His world was a state of conflict and disorder. Everything could change at any moment, suddenly and forever. Another person would just get in the way.

When he arrived, he was greeted by a six story building housing consulting firms and marketing companies. The perfect cover for a telemarketing company. The sign outside indicated that it was on the fourth floor. He walked to the front door and pushed, but it was locked. He stepped back preparing to charge at the door when it was open.

“Can I help you?” A sweet face looked at him, the face of innocence that made him regret going into the business.

“I have an appointment on the fourth floor. It’s urgent,” Henry replied.

“Okay, have fun.” The face walked away. Henry watched as she left and wondered if he should quit the job. He could start a life and a family with that face.

“Do you need help finding the elevator?” Henry was snapped out of his inner monologue.

“No, I’m fine.” He walked to the steel doors, and they opened when he pressed the button. They were expecting him. His righteous fury grew as he rose in the building. He would have his revenge. The doors opened.

The hall was empty, but the lights in the offices were on except for one at the end of the long passage. He had a hunch that was Columbia Cutting. When he arrived, the name tag confirmed his suspicions.

The cowards left before he could reach them. They were unable to face the consequences of their actions, but he would find him. There’s got to be clues inside. He pulled back his sleeve prepared to punch through the door window.

“Looking for someone?” Henry turned to see a harsh face covered in the lines of hard work. It was the kind of face that scared Henry because he knew how much damage a face like that could do.

“I have an appointment with Columbia Cutting.” Henry replied. The face let out a deep sigh and shook his head.

“Sorry pal, no one works there. They just use the address for tax purposes.” The face walked away, and Henry relaxed. But his anger was not quelled. They were still out there calling random people. In the future, there might be a way to permanently get rid of them. For now, no way has yet been invented to say goodbye to them.
