##First Day in the Sun

Ackley sits alone in the cellar. Someone opens the door and tosses in a plate. The door shuts quickly. Outside, Ackley hears the villagers teasing the unlucky soul who had to interact with their prisoner.

Picking up his stick, he walks to the plate. The chain restrains him from getting next to the plate. They never bother to ensure he can reach the food given. Ackley uses the stick to slide the food closer. Collapsing on the floor, he stakes several bites. Stale bread. At least, it isn't moldy.

Using the plate, Ackley strikes at the chain several times. The chain has rusted faster down here. The villagers never considered that their curse would effect it. One of the links splits. With all of his spite, he pulls with his leg until the chain breaks. 

The harvest festival will get another guest.

People gasp and stare when he enters the town square. A few people faint at the site of him. A few whisper in confusion. Some deny their eyes. There's no way he could've escaped. Ackley walks to the table and grabs a piece of the turkey.

"Such a lovely day isn't it." Ackley squints his eyes as he looks at the sky for the first time in years. No one dares respond to him. Ackley laughs. "You've kept me locked up for thirty years, and you have nothing to say to me?"

"I'll say something." Caldwell stands supporting himself on a small cane. "We were all horribly distraught when the witch cursed us. No child should've gone through what you did, and no parent wanted to see their kids suffer. That's why we drew lots; luck didn't favor you that day."

"Do you still tell that story?" Ackley laughs. "My mother told me the truth before she died. You made a deal with the enchantress. Prosperity in exchange for all the suffering going to a single person. Volunteering would've been the true selfless act. You cowards took the option that would prolong the effects."

"You are correct in that we were selfish fools," Caldwell sighs, "But what would you have us do instead?"

"You're going to have to figure out the answer to that question." Ackley takes a bite of fruit. "I am retaking my time in the sun. Enjoy the pain and horror you inflicted on me."

His legs move with the power stored in them for decades. Fresh air kisses his face. The birds sing to welcome him. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees their fields start to go bad and laughs to himself. No more easy path, but he will not concern himself with them.

In the woods, the grass welcomes his feet. The branches part for his arrival. In a small clearing in the middle, he bathes in the sunlight. Ackley is free and alive.
