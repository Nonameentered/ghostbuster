##Pagan Romance

Crimson light snakes through the trees. The night is filled with cries of violence and revenge. Cold air grows hot with rage and torches of the people of Albamunte.

Dusan leans out the window of Breya’s tower staring at the approaching mob. He grips the sill frustrated at his own impotence and worse his self-awareness. If he hadn’t fallen in love with Breya a year ago, he would’ve been in the mob as well. In contrast, Breya is pouring glasses of wine behind him.

“Let us toast to our love.” Breya hands him a glass.

“Now is not the time to drink. You must have a secret passage or a spell that can transport us to safety,” Dusan says.

“I want to spend a few moments celebrating the moments we had then worry about my demise. We all go a little mad sometimes. Just grant me this one wish.” Breya kisses his cheek. 

“Well, alright.” Dusan smiles as he drinks the wine. Breya drinks with her eyes focused on him. Within moments, Dusan’s body begins to glow light blue. Dusan looks at his hands. “Breya, what are you doing?”

“Protecting you. They will rip everything they see to shreds so I protected you from their sight. You will be able to run in the chaos. Go to Kivfoylo. Rebuild your life,” Breya says. Dusan grabs her shoulders.

“But what about you? I don’t want to rebuild my life if you aren’t there.”

“If I escape, the witchfinders will be informed of my presence. They will scour the lands until they find me. I must stay.” The villagers break the gates of the wall. Breya’s garden is set on fire creating a floral stench. Her animals are slaughtered, and they begin pounding on the door that has been reinforced with Breya’s magic.

“Why can’t they recognize your talents as an asset?” Dusan walks to her bookshelf. “You also possess twice as much knowledge as the elders collectively. Yet one crop failure was all it took for them to want your head on a pike.”

“I knew this was a risk when I began studying magic as a girl. Our contentious relationship to the masses goes back centuries.” Breya grabs his hand. “You could not understand this. It’s why I need to protect you.”

“How can you be so serene? You could create decades of famine. You could craft a disease that would bring them to their knees. You could whisper into the night and create a paranoia that will last for generations,” Dusans says. Breya snaps back and places her hands on her hips.

“I may have accepted my fate, but I’m not docile. I would not curse the common person with such horrors. No, they have suffered enough, and their suffering is being manipulated by others.”

“That awful Baron,” Dusan says.

“Indeed, I have no doubt that he will attempt to take my tower for his own purposes. That’s why I gave the rats a permanent home here.” Breya gives Dusan a book.

“Aristotle’s *Politics*, I remember you giving this to me. I realized how astonishing your intelligence was then. The astonishment was quickly replaced by love.” Dusan kisses her.

“Thank you. The knowledge in that book is more dangerous than any spell I could cast. It’s why I’ve enchanted it. It won’t be destroyed with the rest of the books. Instead, it will find a new owner, one who can understand it and won’t view it as jargogle. Baron Leander will find his populace more rebellious than expected,” Breya says.

“Your truths are worse than your lies.” Dusan rubs Breya’s cheeks. The door begins to crack. Breya steps back crying.

“Farewell love.” The door breaks.

Dusan sticks to the walls and watches the carnage. Her furniture is smashed. The portraits collected are torn. He moves to the cellar to watch the chaos in her laboratory. Her ingredients and mixtures are smashed and stomped. A woman hesitates when she recognizes the elixir that cured her disease, but she surrenders to the anger and destroys it. 

Two men drag Breya into the courtyard by the arms. Breya struggles against them as pitchforks stab her. Dusan looks away unable to watch his love be tortured. The fire in the garden grows as the books are added as fuel. One man slips *Politics* in his shirt for safekeeping. The two men bring her to the fire. Dusan can no longer tolerate the terror before his eyes. He scurries through the people to outside her grounds. When he reaches the forest, he starts to run towards Kivfoylo and his new life.
