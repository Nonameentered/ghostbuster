##For Crows

Hope. Anger. Regret. Glory. Stupidity. Bravery. Cowardice.

Morrigan wets her lips when thinking about all she will consume today. The battle will be retold as a great victory and a colossal loss. She has no interest in whichever side won. Her source of pleasure is the large amounts of food left out in the open. Her children descend onto the ground to satiate their hunger. 

She saunters through the empty field observing her children. They start with the soft eyeballs. A tasty appetizer engrained with the last image seen. Her children broadcast these emotional scenes to Morrigan. These morsels tease her. Her blood rushes, and her heart beats faster. She sweats as the illusion of death overcomes her. 

A few crows have already consumed the eyes, but they are still hungry. Pecking through the sockets, they tear off chunks of the mind inside. Her body shakes as the emotions of a thousand men overcome her. Their creativity becomes hers; only restrained by their inhibitions.

The frontal lobe is quickly consumed, and she begins to smell the horrors of war. The chemicals that killed these soldiers provides a nice seasoning. Her mouth opens and she babbles as she acquires the human's modes of speech. 

Some skulls have been destroyed, and large amounts of crows have gathered around a few corpses. Morrigan prepares herself as the entirety of human existence is sent to her. Her muscles jerk and twist. Memories of the lifetimes lost overwhelm her. Pain simultaneously forces her to run and to fight. She feels alive.

The sensations recede as her children fly away having their bellies full. Morrigan lies in the field tired and satisfied from the exertion. Humanity never fails to provide her with new experiences. Wars and battles are truly delightful. Humans never stop engaging in them; no matter how much of a detriment conflict is to them. Morrigan stands to leave the carnage. She benefits from their follies.
