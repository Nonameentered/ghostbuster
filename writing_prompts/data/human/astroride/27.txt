##Signs from the Universe

Thea sits on her porch enjoying the sunrise when a man walks up the hill. She tries to look over his head to enjoy the last bits of sunlight, but he is determined to get her attention. The man kneels before Thea, but his knees wobble. He bends his neck slightly to avoid looking up at her. Clearly, he isn't used to kneeling.

"Oh great Oracle. I am Archon Basil, and I come to ask for your guidance." He tries to avoid making his words sound commands, but old habits die hard.

"Hmm." Thea stares at him closely. "I don't like you."

The man stands and clenches his fist. He calms himself before he acts impulsive. "Do you mean that my future is filled with tragedy?"

"No, I can't see the future. I just know how to read the universe, and you." Thea scrunches her face. "I've read your type many times. You are about to embark on a campaign of conquest right?"

"Your words are the truth."

"I know they're my words, and archons never visit me for other reasons. It's always they're about to go to war with a great power, and their victory is uncertain. If they've come to me, then they've already lost." Thea takes a sip of wine. "Well, I hope they lose. A few probably won."

"But I am not uncertain. I am confident," Basil says.

"Indeed, I can tell."

"And I am not deluded by my own prowess. Victory is not achieved by one's glory, but by tactics and strategy. One cannot assume victory. One must plan to have an edge."

"Quite true."

"I also understand the value of my soldiers. If they're starving and tired, they would never win. They need to be kept in the best condition and given proper motivation."

"Perhaps I was wrong. You are different than the rest," Thea smiles.

"I had hoped to persuade you of my merits." Basil bows again.

"Yes, I can tell by the shape of the clouds that you will be succeed in destroying a great state. Glory will reign," Thea says.

"Thank you. I've brought some coins for the prediction." Basil hands her a bag. 

"Wonderful. Your campaign will be a success," Thea says. Basil turns and leaves. Thea shakes her head.

"That idiot didn't even notice there were no clouds in the sky. That's the problem with archons. They never listen. Always get in their own heads." Thea checks the bag again. "This one does seem more gracious and intelligent than the rest. Granted, he certainly lacked humility like his peers."

Thea sips her wine again. "When will someone come to me to just chat about the weather? Why can't I have that?"
