Bob was special, different from the rest of us. Not because he could tear bones from skin like Gregor, or shape matter like Cerule, certainly couldn't heal like Havawitz, but special because he always had our backs. When the chips were down Bob was always watching over us, trusty weapon in hand. A "sniper rifle" he'd called it, ensuring when we mislabeled it as a crossbow or staff he corrected us. 

"Oh no, I'm not Cerule, she has the staff. She's something special. I'm just Bob." he'd say before his sniper rifle sounded off with that devastating blast and another orc body dropped in the distance. It sure looked like magic to me every time he used it. 

Bob was strange like that. Not strange like us, but just...different. He tucked his shirt in his pants and made sure those little plastic buttons on the front went all the way up to his neck. And if his belt wasn't on the third notch then it was a bad day for Bob. I had only seen Bob have one bad day and it had led to a mountain of bodies and a banning from one of the most notorious trading towns on the east coast. Of course, when his day was going better again he returned to apologize. Bob was thoughtful like that. 

Even though we were surely all curious, really it didn't matter where he'd come from. Sometimes Gregor would ask on those late nights of traveling when conversations roamed and Bob would always reply: "Well where'd you come from Gregor?". And of course the brute could never think up an answer with meaning enough to reply. But I think really we were all just glad. Glad that we had someone watching over us. Glad that we had a man in the bushes, a Bob. 

But most of all, glad he was on our side.
