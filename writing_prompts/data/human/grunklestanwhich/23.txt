A mist of bullets rained overhead, whizzing past the trees and off further into the forest. Splinters of wood showered down from above me as I hit the ground, gun at my waist and soon after up to my hands. But I panicked. I could not see them, could not see what to aim at, actually...shit, I couldn't see anything at all that wasn't trees. 

"Anybody got anything!" I called out aloud between spurts of gunfire. No response. 

With a shaky hand I reached down to the belt at my waist and withdrew a small visor. More rounds flew by, this time peppering the ground to my right and sending dirt up to the air. With the visor up to my eyes the world became a dark shade of blue. Quickly I scanned until I saw it, outlines of red and orange about eighty foot out poking out from behind the trees. I counted aloud: one...two...three..., and continued until the numbers became too high for the count to even matter. 

"This is Gamma-17 requesting immediate assistance! I've got a fucking platoon out here opposite me and I'm on my own." 

There was a long silence on the radio. Even the great booms of gunfire ceased, as if my enemy also awaited the response. After a moment a voice replied, not human, but robotic. "Request received. Allocating units. Be safe, Vickers."

Be safe? The war machines rarely spoke, let alone use our comms. I hadn't even known they could until now. But that voice was unmistakable. It was a Yule, no doubt. Usually they just did what they were built for: war. Not that I wasn't thankful for it. At least something had heard me, I guess even luckier it was a war machine. 

The gunfire sounded again, this time the visor showed their bodies moving closer. Their blurred orange outlines threatening to be my downfall. I tried my best to crawl in silence to a new location in the forest, gun gripped tight. They could kill me, but I wouldn't let it be easy. 

"Cmon Yule, you haven't let me down yet, don't start now." I mumbled, trying my best to maintain a whisper through the sounds of warfare. To my surprise a voice crackled through the radio in reply:

"Never."

Then the forest stopped. The sounds stopped. No noise. Somewhere from far behind me deep within the trees a spark lit. There was a loud boom. Then the trees before me exploded. Not exploded in a flash of heat and sound, but simply disintegrated into piles of wooden shards, as if they had just decided to exist no longer. Behind them my previously covered enemies stood exposed and confused. I watched on as they grew panicked, some dropping to their stomachs and others looking up to the sky frantically for something to shoot. They did not know what came next. 

But I did: The Yules, my comrades, had arrived. 

"You are clear to dispatch." I spoke into the radio. 

"Affirmative. I am glad we have arrived in time."

"Me too." 

The men in the treeless circle could not feel it, but I could. A vibration in the air that encompassed the forest like a shallow fog. Usually I tried to look the other way, I did not like what came next, but today, well today I didn't care so much. The vibrations grew, shaking the leaves and branches of the trees lining the circle. Their eyes grew in horror as they began to disintegrate, legs first, up and up until the wind blew what remained of them off as a red powder. 

I breathed a long sigh of relief as I heard the Yules approach through the trees from closer than I'd thought. First one, then two, until the sound became one long rumble of mechanical steps in rhythmic unison. As I stood to see, my eyes grew wide. A whole unit, at least fifty huge machines marched through the forest, their mechanical frames just contained within the treetops. One Yule could handle a few hundred men, so fifty of them? An entire army. 

"Uhm. I do appreciate the help, but uh...well any reason y'all all came out for lil old me?" I spoke into my radio. 

The robotic voices of the Yules replied in unison: "Because you called. You'd have done the same for us."

That was the difference between them and I. Their war machines were just that, machines. Their fellow soldiers just tools of the trade. But mine? All were my brothers.
