*They had given me chances, lord knows probably too many chances. Maybe I had just learned to take advantage of that.*

The room was as I'd remembered it from when I'd visited last year. That same old, unchanging style of a childhood home, of old vases with stories behind them. A couch that had long since needed replaced. Wooden panels that had somehow not decayed into nothing in the many years they'd been in their placement on the walls. Old. Old, but comforting. Coming back had felt like just coming home again. 

My mom looked to me from the kitchen, a golden aura emanating off of her like a full-body halo. I was glad to see her feelings for me were so unchanging. They may have shifted from time to time, but they always went back to that golden love. 

I watched as she fiddled with what I assumed to be dinner. Considering I just popped in I didn't expect her to have anything ready so fast. 

My brother, younger and smarter than me, looked to me with blue. That started last year, the blue. When I visited and came through the door back then I'd expected to see the usual green he wore, for excitement. Hell I would've even taken pink or purple from him, gray or orange, any color but blue. But there he was still. On the couch, trying to avoid me with his eyes. Glancing. Only glancing. And when his eyes met me he lit up that sad shade of blue. I hated it. 

"Hey uh...dad home soon?" I called out to ma, who was fidgeting with a bag of carrots in the kitchen

"Yeah honey, he should be home any minute now." she looked up to me as she spoke and the gold turned orange. Worry. 

"Oh ok...well I'm excited to see him." I didnt have much else to say. Only to wait. 

Before long I heard his car outside. That old truck he refused to get rid of. Something about "reliability". "If it's lasted this long then it can last forever" he used to say. 

As I heard his footsteps coming up to the door my brother bowed out, getting up and wandering off to the back. He gave me one last glance of sadness. Then, a man walked through the door. It was my dad, surely, but I didn't recognize him. Didn't feel comfort in the wrinkles of his face or the steadiness of his eyes. He might as well have been a stranger. 

He looked to me with disregard, and I held my breath as he did, wondering what color I'd see of him. Last time it was red, a bright, blinding red. Anger. I was ok with anger, at least anger was something. 

Maybe this time he would be blue, like Harry. I was ok with blue. 

But as his eyes met me something formed that I'd never seen before. A deep, sunken black spread from him, flying out like a pair of crows wings and encasing his back. This stranger, my dad, gave me a look I'd never seen before and with it an emotion of the same. After a glance he looked away, and I was thankful I didn't have endure whatever that was for any longer. 

"Jason. Here for money or food this time?" he walked over to my mother and kissed her on the cheek, then opened the fridge and rifled around. 

"I uhh...you mad at me or something?" 

"No. I haven't been mad at you in a long time." this time when he looked back to me the blackness only wafted up like a light fog. I still wasnt sure what it was. What it meant. But it hurt to look at. 

Mom looked to me with golden reassurance. "So sweetie...why did you say you stopped by?" 

"Well I was just gunna-" I cut myself short. "Just to say hi. I'll head out. Good to see you ma, pop." 

As I walked out I could see him looking to me. That black aura still surrounding him, but there was something else buried deep in it. Just a flicker, but there nonetheless, of a bit of gold.
