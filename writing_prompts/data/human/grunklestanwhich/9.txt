The party of three stared in silence, watched on as the orange flames licked up the sides of the building and into the windows. They were heroes, or at least they would have described themselves as such thirty minutes prior. But now? Now nobody in the group was so sure anymore. A hunk of smoldering wood fell at their feet, half burned, that read:

  *St. Marry-Annes Orphana*

The musicman, Halon, was the only one to look down to the hunk, the rest too awestruck to notice it had even fallen. Halon could feel his anger building as he stared at the sign. As he heard screams from inside the building. He looked up to his much larger friend, or what had been his friend. Once again he found himself unsure of what they were.  

"WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT!?‚Äù he yelled, breaking the silence between them. 

The larger man did not flinch. Did not even look to Halon. Instead he just let out a long sigh. 

"Well...that could've went better, I'll admit. I didn't think-" 
Before he could finish Halon was at his throat, blade gripped tightly, tears welling in his eyes. 

"Didn't think?! You are supposed to be the best of us! Supposed to be the line that stands between- between good and whatever this is!" Halon gestured to the building, still in flames. The screams now silent. 

"Woah Halon... don't you think he should have a chance to speak his peace?" the sorceress to their side spoke calmly but her orange eyes were wild like an animals. Her hands shook as the flames of the building outlined her silhouette in the dark. Halon's silence served as the only invitation for the paladin to speak. 

"I am a Paladin. I worry about the greatest good for the greatest number of people. That is my job. Do you really think, for even a second, that I wanted to kill children? EVER wanted to do this!", the roof of the building finally collapsed in on itself, sinking in the middle and blowing a cloud of smoke into the sky, cementing that nobody inside had survived. From around the back of the now collapsed orphanage the party's fourth member walked to them with slumped shoulders. 

The paladin continued. "No, But we were sent here to do a job Halon. Have you ever looked one of those things in the eyes? Have you fought a Mind Flayer? Seen what they're capable of? If we didn't...if I didn't, then the town would have fallen. Maybe even the country. They were taken." The paladin tried to speak with finality, but his words came out unsure. 

"But there were kids! Not all of them were-" the knife clattered to the ground and Halon followed, dropping to his knees in a heap. The paladin let out a long held breath and with it a stream of tears. Their fourth joined them in their pity, in their shame, his face covered in dirt and his long hair dipped in ash. The burns on his hands revealed his failure. 

Between sobs Halon, now held in the sorceresses scarred arms mumbled. "Athlen...what- what are we now?" 

The large man didn't have to think to answer. Nothing had changed. Only another pile of bodies, innocent bodies, and another day saved. Another trial he would have to live with passing. 

"We're heroes Halon."
