The stone walled room had a strange aura to it, a feeling that surely hadn't existed before, so just now was brought into being. A feeling mixed of tension and curiosity shared by both members seated across the table from one another. The human, Gregor as he was called, scaled lower on the curiosity meter but much higher in the tension category. Across from him, a being who's name would be unpronounceable to Gregor without a tongue flap (which sadly he did not possess), was more in the curiosity zone of things. 

They simply stared at one another, letting Gregor's words hang in the thick air of the ship. He repeated them, this time with more conviction, "I am here to convince you to eliminate humanity. All of it." 

The alien with the unpronounceable name stood and paced, two demonic like legs beneath him. Its clawed feet tapped along the stone floors lightly. Its four blackened eyes stayed still, focused on a point. Gregor simply watched. After a long moment the demon creature turned back. "What sort of trick is this?" 

"Not a trick. And you're running out of time." 

Behind the two through a thick glass door more of the alien species ran around the ship, some passing by and trying not to make their inside stares obvious. Others taking glances over their shoulders every few moments. 

"Do you know why I am here? Why I came in that thing and risked myself to be here?" Gregor gestured to a pad outside holding his ship, more if a pod really. A decaying amalgamation of parts and wires with a sleek glass cockpit. 

"Humor me." The alien thing replied coldly, taking its seat once more. 

"We are a cancer. A disease. Space travel? Gods biggest  mistake in its allowance. Just an excuse to conquer more and more; to Manifest Destiny our way through the galaxy. Except in space every direction is west." Gregor's voice grew in intensity as he spoke. The alien showed surprise, if that was possible for something without many features. Just mandibles and rough skin. 

"We already planned to do this.", the being across the table let out a noise meant to be a laugh but it sounded more like a hunk of metal in a blender. "So thank you for the *tip* but we will carry o-" He looked up to see Gregor walking towards the door that lead to his ship, his shoulders slumped. A beep came slowly from the watch on his wrist. 

"I was afraid of this. As I said, out of time. I'll try with the next ones." 

Behind him those same aliens before that stared in or worked diligently now scrambled. A light flashed overhead from somewhere in the stone ships cockpit and bodies ran to positions. Out of the window Gregor could see a fleet-no- a sea of ships materialize from thin air, massive guns at the ready. If there was one thing his people were good at, it was war. 

In the rearview of his ship he did not need to look to see the destruction. Did not need to see to know their planet was being taken. Instead he puffed on in search of the next planet in a long line to tell his silent words to.
