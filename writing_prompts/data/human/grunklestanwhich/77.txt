The man across the sidewalk rasped his throat for a moment  before producing a rather nasty glob of spit and sending it to the ground. 

"Vampire then eh?". His hand disappeared into his waistcoat and gripped something, it wasn't hard to guess what. 

"No no, you'll find I am quite human, doctor.", at the mentioning of his title his posture shifted. His low prowl changed to a tall stance of pride. Even his eyes, from a skeptical peering to a stern stare. From hunter to what he was: a man with more titles than I jobs completed. I think I preferred the hunter. 

"Ah, so then you just work for one then. I should have figured, seeing this didn't seem to do much." he revealed his hand to be holding a large silver cross. 

"Yes, well it seems fate has crossed our paths. It should have happened sooner no doubt but...well to be frank I kept coming back to dead employers and an annoying lack of payment."

"Be thankful. That money is blood money. If anything I've saved you the trouble." his words came quick, so fast that my replies barely had time to leave my lips before I was met by his words. The reputation of Dr. Van Helsing preceded him, which by all means was a hard thing to do. Every man, woman, and vampire alike had heard the stories of his feats. The people that had looked to him as a symbol of safety. The vampires that did tread a little more carefully on hunts. And me, well I didnt fully believe them until now; showing that my brave face was less brave than I'd thought. 

"I have no qualm with you. Just... stay away from my employer or there will be trouble." 

In that moment I felt his silhouette swallow mine, leaving me left in his shadow. He seemed large. Incredibly, impossibly large. I did my best to hold on, not to cower in his presence but I had never felt such an aura before. His voice lowered to a soft whisper. 

"Oh, Is that so?... I have never been a killer of man. Never a murderer of the living. But for you? I could make an exception. Tell your employer I will arrive soon, or dont. He will likely be a pile of ash befor you arrive. Consider this your payment." Dr. Helsing reached into his coat once again and I winced, unable to keep it together any longer. Though upon withdrawing it he held a fold of bills that he outstretched with a gloved hand. Hesitantly I took it, knowing it meant the failure of another job taken to protect from the vampires boogeyman. 

With that he turned and left off into the darkness. I stood and watched, wondering all the while if maybe I'd picked the wrong profession.
