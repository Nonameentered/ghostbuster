I expected fire. I expected pain. For the oil to roast my arm and fry my skin, then, as it had done the others, for my suffering to kill me. The court would gossip before my body turned cold. "Even his son was not worthy. I knew him to be a heathen all along." The members of the court would speak all day, but ask them to prove their own faith and they had little left to say. 

But when I stuck my hand in the oil and pulled it out whole, it silenced them. When I showed no pain and the oil showed me no harm they went quiet.Their witless remarks shoved back down their throats by the stunned silence that came when one so confident is so wrong. I will never forget their slack-jawed gazes. How the sphere of influence shrunk that day in the court when the faces realized that real power can't be bought. It can only be proven. 

My father, the high priest, looked at me from his placement. He'd never liked the term "throne". Said it made him seem unapproachable. The king called his seat a throne, what that said about my father I had not known. He looked to me with a stunned gaze that shifted to one of comfort. He stood, withered and draped in his vestments. I had seldom seen him without them, and when I did his arms remained covered. I should have known. 

When he removed his robes his arm was withered, a shriveled burnt thing. Tens of men of faith must have died in attempts to pass this test today alone. My fathers test that he had not even passed. I was not his successor, no, I was the first. So when he removed his robes to reveal that gnarled arm his words meant little more than his actions, though he said them regardless. 

"To think my son to have more piety than I. What an honor. Bow, for your new High Priest!" and the court did. But when I tipped the pot over, still bare handed. When I threw it to the wayside they backed up in fear and confusion. Yet I still took my place. 

"No, not new. Stand, for your first High Priest"
