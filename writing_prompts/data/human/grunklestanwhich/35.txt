The room around me blurred as my hands worked steadily, practically stuffed inside of a mans chest. A chart on the wall read: *Joseph Wright, 24.*, beside it a picture of his x-ray. The image showed his ribs, beyond that his lungs, and in them a series of small rigid shards. I was told he had been in an "accident", but rarely did I see an accident that sent heaps of metal into a mans chest. 

Carefully I pulled another shard loose and dropped it into the bedside pan with a metallic *tink*. He was stable, thankfully; the machine at his left giving off a steady read of his pulse to prove it. I would know quickly if he wasn't though. Not because of that tangle of machines he was hooked up to but rather when I saw the silhouette of an old acquaintance. The shape of death itself. 

I don't know when I started to see him exactly. It's hard to say on account of the way he just appears in a room. Maybe I always did, or maybe even now I just imagined his shape in the room. Can't say it was never a sign though. When he showed up I knew it was time to work as I never had before. To make bargains I often couldn't keep and sometimes never did. I wondered at the back of my mind on and off if he'd show today, then, as if an answer to my grim expectations he had arrived. 

From the corner of the room the faceless figure watched as I pulled another sliver of metal free and dropped it in the tray.I tried my best not to notice him. To focus on my work and let the room blur again, but my eyes kept drifting to that black spot in the corner. Before long the nurses noticed my gaze and their pace slowed too. They could not see him, so they only stared where I did. 

"Will you three give me some room?" I spoke with a false confidence. After a few confused looks and glares of doubt the team obliged, stepping back a few feet. Death saw his opportunity and slid in close until he loomed over the other side of the table. 

"Five minutes. Just five minutes please." I whispered out into the open air. He seemed to consider, lurking silently under that blackened cloak. Then, with a voice like a winters wind he replied: "You have four. Then I collect. If you'd like more then it's the usual." Death reached down and pulled back his robe to reveal a bony wrist with an hourglass strapped to it.

The usual. Soul for a soul. I had yet to lose that bet, but then again that's not one you can lose twice. 

"Deal, but I get ten." 

He did not reply, just twisted the sand beginning its countdown and sealing our deal. The clock on the wall now showed a countdown rather than a time, indicating down to the millisecond how screwed I was. Whether or not my team was thinking strange of me did not matter now, I cared only to win. 

The minutes after flew like seconds and all the while I did not dare to look at that countdown, only to work like a machine, removing pieces of metal left and right. Every *clink* in the pan meant another moment further away from death for both me and my patient. It almost felt selfish how my heart raced with excitement. Felt strange how invigorating the race from my own demise was. Of course it was about my patient, but even more so it was about me. 

Finally after what felt like an eternity I had finished. His pulse remained steady and I looked up to death who remained in the corner. Then I looked to the clock on the wall: *:-08* it read. Negative, by eight entire seconds. As death slid forward I braced myself to be taken, but the patients pulse was unchanged, he had not died.

Death loomed over once again, then leaned down slowly until he reached my ear. There was a long silence that followed, not just shared between the reaper and I, but by the others in the room too. Finally he groaned, "Congratulations John Weathersby. You have completed your task old friend. If you weren't such an interesting point in my day I'd have your soul, but then again, where's the fun in that?" his voice screeched against my eardrum. 

"Until next time, Doctor Weathersby." and his image faded from the room. Next to me the patients pulse on the monitor ceased from peaks to a singular, flat line. 

I let out a long sigh as the team around me rushed into action. I knew better than to try. I guess you can't win em all.
