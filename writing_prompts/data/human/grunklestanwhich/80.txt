It was a quiet evening. There weren't many of those anymore here, in the heart of Gaitlin. Mostly just noisy evenings of people yellin' at each other like they hated the other down to the contents of their stomachs. That and the sounds of cars being broken into. I was given a firm reminder of that everytime I went to my own and saw the trashbag I'd taped over the window a few weeks ago. 

Sometimes from my window I'd hear a spell being cast from somewhere close. They carried the unmistakable sound of crackling air and left behind a stench of gunpowder that I could smell from even a few streets over. But tonight carried none of that, which is exactly why I worried. 

See, when you could hear the danger you knew what to expect. You could avoid it easy when it made itself known, but when it stalked you. When it lurked just waiting to strike, well then you became the sound that others avoided. 

As I walked the street my nerves grew. It wasn't my first underground event, but the first I'd be running alone. Typically at these sorts of things a moderator came as part of the package. The "auctioneer" as I was called, and the "moderator" as my silent better half, except this time the moderator called out, and my half could technically run solo. So I did. Double the money at least. 

As I approached the building of the event the streetlights above grew sparse until I was left in near darkness. If it weren't for the sidewalk below leading in only one direction I'd have surely been lost to the street, a thought that only built upon my already weighted nerves. The quiet continued. It grew like something I could feel. With every moment I only became more sure that something sinister would break it. 

Most events I attended were ratty, and this one no different. At the door a crooked nosed man with a spellbook hanging at his side tried the "If you fuck up ill punch your teeth in" look, but I had been given it so many times before it wasn't as potent. After a moment of *who are you's* and *whats your business's* I was let through a metal door into the beyond. God I wished my moderator was here. Without him I was forced to talk to every sleazy face I passed just to find the stage booth. 

On the floor was a sea of delinquent faces, some I recognized from other auctions I thought, but no names came to mind. The building was more warehouse than club, more crumbling than stable, more shitty than not-shitty. Everywhere I looked a new patch of mold grew, as if my gaze alone spawned its existence. Above a few lines of swinging bulbs with magical runes contained within served as lights for the space to a surprisingly effective means. What else did I expect? These illegal type spots didn't typically roll out the red carpet (not that they could afford one anyways.) 

With my place up on the stage the auction began. From somewhere beyond the torn curtain behind me artifacts of power began rolling out carried in by suited men. An urn here, a fleshbound book there, all par for the course. Once the stage was filled the room suddenly reeked with that same sort of palpable silence from outside, only broken by my voice: "Starting the bid at fifty do I have fifty. Sixty! Can I get a seve- Seventy!" 

Artifacts flew off the stage left and right into greedy hands. Anything of even remote power was quickly snatched up before the slow had a chance to react. Lucky for me I was not slow, so when the final piece entered the stage I was quick to act. 

"Final piece ladies and gentlemen! A Beautiful Advanced book of Casting dated 1652. Full of wonderful spells lost to time." I was meant to read lines about the pieces, but they had long been forgotten, so winging it was the next best thing. 

"Starting the bidding at seventy-five do I have seventy-five?" the crowd remained thick, but had gone silent, most too busy thinking if their new buys to worry about another piece. Lucky for me. 

"Fine I'll put in at eighty! Eighty going once." 

"Hey you can't do that!" a voice I couldn't pinpoint cried out in protest. 

"Can-and-did-chief. If you want it then be faster, if not then shut up. Do I hear eighty-five?" 

"Fuck you! Yeah eighty-five right here!" this time I found the voice in the crowd. A rather tall man with little hair to spare on his chrome-like head. Shirtless, for some reason, and looking more pissed by the moment. 

"Oooo. Too-late-chief. Sold to me! Eighty! Good try!" 

With a bow I walked to claim my prize. Below me the crowd went back to mumbling between each other, surely discussing their new toys. As I picked up the book it seemed to carry more weight than I'd thought. In fact, it felt as if the pages grew heavier by the second, dragging itself back down to the table. I struggled to hold it up to no avail as its density continued to grow. Then I smelled it, gunpowder. The crackling of air. Behind me the balding man stood tall with an aura of anger. 

"Thats my fucking book" his eyes bared down on my back as the book continued to gain weight. 

"Oh yeah? Then why the fuck am I holding it?" I spoke to him without turning. 

I could hear it before I could see it. The man casting something particularly nasty for me. Usually my moderator would handle it, but he was at home in bed, and I was about to be killed. The moment the air started to crackle once again the crowd dispersed in a chaotic shuffle. He spoke the attack to life *Forcel!*, to which a wind of knives flew over my shoulder and tore the curtain on the stage to shreds.

With all my might I pushed the books cover up and over. Index, fuck. Another nasty wave of energy at my feet that I barely dodged just as a cloud of splinters flew from the stage. With another push I opened the book to the middle, to a wave of spells lost to time, and spoke: *Frey-Hëld-Callie-Oythr-Dræth-Gour*, the spells poured out of my mouth one after the other with my auctioneer voice still on. The slight crackle that came with casting was instead a lightning storm, surrounding me whole and striking with every word. 

After my tyrade had finished I looked to the man...or more of a pile now. Charred bones filled with holes, a pile of acid stained meat and frozen bits of flesh, a horror show more like. I felt the need to leave as fast as my legs would carry me. To run home with my words and bury my head within my spells. Luckily nobody was there to see. Even if they did all they'd have witnessed was a moment of great power followed by a longer moment of fear. 

The book was lighter now. Light enough to carry, and with it that silence on the way home no longer had the same anxiety it had before. It had a new one. One that meant at any moment maybe I'd be the one to break it.
