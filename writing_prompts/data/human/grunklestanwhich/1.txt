"None of what you just drank was water muchacho, in fact I don't think any of it was even edible..." I spoke to my crewmate in awe. 

Four of us on the ship. Me, a human of course; Jacks, a mecha of some sort; the tentacled thing that just used a container of something labeled *Concentrated Mercury* to quench its thirst, Rabble I called him; and finally, Steven. 

The three of us stared to Rabble in amazement, and he, or, well, it, stared back in obvious obliviousness. Its face began turning green, even greener than usual. 

"Wha- well I was thirsty! I needed some water." Rabble protested, tentacles flaring for effect. 

"Ah yes. Well the capsule labeled *water* would have sufficed then" Jacks gestured over to the water capsule on the wall with a robotic hand as Rabble's face turned a shade greener.  "Well, that isn't good." she continued. 

"Nope! How did you even get on the crew anyway hombr-" before I could finish I was shoved aside by an almost human hand. Steven gripped Rabble by the shoulders and launched it into a divit built into the floor labeled *Med-Bay*, the words drawn on sloppily in orange paint. 

"Hey I think I'm actually fine-". Rabble tried to get the words out, but with a push of a button by Steven a glass slide flew over the med-bay, silencing the toxic sipping alien. A screen then flew up from the floor. 

*Analyzing....Analyzing.....Well that's not good.*, the screen displayed in bold yellow text. Followed by:

*1 Liter Concentrated Mercury* 

*2 Cups Swamp Extract* 

*1 Vial of Unknown Radioactive Liquids* 

*2 Vials of Known Radioactive Liquids (Greemly Excretion...Gross)* 

Inside the tube Rabble craned its gelatinous neck to try and read the screen. Upon seeing the analysis he rolled his one, massive eye, a gesture he'd picked up from me no doubt. On the outside Jack's and my mouths dropped open as if we were trying to catch Crantumium Flies. 

Swamp extract?! We had to gather that sludge fully suited and use a titanium scoop, even then we barely got the two cups, and this troglodyte drank it all!

 Steven was already reaching for a scalpel out of the med-pak. 

"Hey uh..Steve-o. Whatcha gunna do with that bad boy?" I spoke with uncertain certainty. 

"Steven. It's Steven, though I do appreciate the nickname. I planned to cut open Rabblenous, locate its stomach sac, cut it open, and retrieve our samples." 

Inside the tube Rabble, having now seen his fate, was now banging his tentacles against the glass. I was just as keen to get our samples back as the next guy, or whatever human adjacent thing Steven was, but cutting open a crewmate was just unprofessional. 

"Well let's not do anything too rash...yet. Ok computer how long will Rabble take to digest any of that stuff." 

If the computer had eyes to roll it would have, but due to the fact that it didn't instead the words appeared across its screen: *Eye Roll* as a replacement 

*...Fine...5 days 23 hours. But cutting the beast open would be faster and far more fun.*

"Not the point. Ok Steven, hear me out. The rest of the team gets out here in 2 days. So we leave Rabble here, gather some different samples, and wait for them with the stomach pump. If they're not out here in 2 days then..." 

I heard the sound of more bottles clinking, dropping to the ground, interrupting my gamble. Upon looking over a single of Rabble's slimy tentacles was rifling through the "Biohazard" bin. Rabble glanced over to the tentacle, then back to us, then back to the tentacle, which continued its search. 

Jack grabbed a second and third scalpel from the shelf, handing me the extra.
