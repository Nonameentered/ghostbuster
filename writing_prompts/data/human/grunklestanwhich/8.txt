The massive stone doors opened slightly, revealing a stream of light peeking through on the other side, then closed again. There was a long moment of silence as Harold watched on below, feeling dwarfed by the mass of the stones. 

"Hello? Is there like...a helper here?" he called out into the landscape surrounding him. 

 As if in response once more they shook open, hesitated, then slammed shut entirely with thud that echoed throughout the surrounding mountains. Harold could've sworn that this time when they closed he could hear a lock latch closed on the other side. After another long moment of hesitation the doors groaned opened again, slower this time; a single man walking through the bright light shining from the other side. 

"Ahhh. I've seen this before." a viking man walked out, long haired with a neon orange high-vis vest on and a nametag that read *Heimdall, Watchman of the Gods.  "The sound of a man being rejected from Valhalla is unmistakable. So, how did you pass?" 

Heimdall did not look to Harold as he spoke, only continued to look the gates up and down with squinted eyes then down to a little clipboard. 

"I uhh. Well I was getting fired up about East India Trade routes in the eighteenth century and I just wound up here."

"Ah India! So you are from India then?" Heimdall knocked on the stone etching of the door, to which it did not respond. 

"Well no...I was sort of just talking about it."

"And that's when you got stabbed?" 

"Well uh...no." 

"Shot?" 

"I dont think-" 

"Thrown from a rooftop?" 

The doors opened once more showering the stone platform upon which Harold stood with heavenly light. Through the other side a burlier figure walked out, muscles taut, a small square on his bare chest that read *Thor, God of Thunder*. 

"Ah, who is this then!" Thor gestured to Harold with his mighty hammer, it too sporting a little white square that read: *Mjolnir, Hammer* 

"I'm actually unsure. He's an indian fellow though. Ferocious fighters! Anyways let's see..." Heimdall snapped his fingers and a tag appeared on Harold's button up shirt. *Harold, Master Debater*. 

"DEBATER?!" Thor roared with a voice that rattled the gates to Valhalla. 

"MASTER!" Heimdall yelled out in excitement, not nearly as loud. 

Harold did not roar, did not even yell, instead he tried to make himself seem as small as possible amongst the gods before him. To his pleasure they did not seem to notice. 

"He's not a fighter he's... he's....a poet!" Thor gagged the words out. 

Heimdall on the other hand now had a keen interest in Harold. He approached him with opened arms to embrace him, lifting him off the ground as if he weighed nothing. 

"A master in his craft! Certainly he is deserving of Valhalla. Those deemed master only come round once in a millenia. You must be quite good. Ooo quick! Say something argumentative!" 

Harold searched for the words, but could only muster up: "I don't know if I'm in the right place actually. Thor may be right I'm afraid." 

"Yes just like that, that was good! Now argue your way INTO Valhalla." Heimdall awaited with excitement, to no reply. Harold kicked his feet along the rocks trying to find the words, but he didn't know why he was here, let alone know what lied behind the doors before him. He could begging for eternal damnation for all he knew. Begging to spend an eternity with these two muscle bound strangers. But on the other hand... he'd never lost an argument and he wasn't going to start now. 

"Well...God of Thunder. I couldn't help but notice your tag does not read *Master of Thunder* in fact, it doesn't say master at all. I would assume a master would be granted entry." 

Thors face tightened. His jaw tensed. "Watch your tongue mortal. You are still but a man. A powerless man at that." 

"A master. That's what the tag says. Go ahead. Beat me and I will go where you wish. Best me in a battle of words and I will leave to whatever hell you wish." 

Thor stared on, steely eyed, with a look that could topple an empire, but Harold did not fault. Showing weakness was the first way to lose a debate. Was the fastest way to lose. 

"Do you know who he is mortal? He is Thor, God of Thunder, Son of Odin. Strongest of us." Heimdall's spoke. 

"Yes. I know exactly who he is. The offer stands." 

A long moment of silence on the field between the three. Any other mortal and Thor would not have flinched to remove his head from his shoulders, but Harold? Suddenly he liked Harold. Thor began a chuckle that turned into a bellowing road of laughter. Heimdall joined in, tears in his eyes and doubled over on the floor. 

"How bold! No man at the gates has stood up to me. You truly are a Master Debater Harold! He did not even need to argue, you could just tell his veins were icier than the peaks of JÃ¶tunheimr! Enter, please enter mortal!" 

At his command the gates groaned forth, the three entering into the heavenly light shoulder to shoulder. Thor, Heimdall, and Harold, Master Debater.
