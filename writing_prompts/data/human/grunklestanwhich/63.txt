Life eternal seemed so nice an eternity ago. Now, an eternity later I had nothing more than thousands of years of fading memories and worthless stories. A thousand years of graves to visit, of coffins to bear, of children to bury. Some of their names over the years I had grown to forgot; trying to remember them only saddened me...and if I couldn't then all the worse. 

My memories and my cabin were what remained of me. It wasn't much, but then again neither was I. I was thankful to at least have that much. I had built it some time ago. It had take me surely longer than most average men, however ling that is. When you have all the time in the world you stop counting so much. Now, aside from the bees, trees, and me I didn't get company. I think I preferred it, after all in my thousand years I'd had enough for company. But fate in the form of some poorly dressed misfits seemed to have other ideas. 

The group stared from outside towards my cabin, seeming confusion on the large ones face. As for the other three they seemed to be in disagreement over a piece of paper, a map maybe. Finally one of the smaller ones, a girl, pointed up to me. To the window I peered through. How she saw me I didn't know, the windows were blacked out, meant to be one way; a particularly handy architect taught me a hundred or so years ago. Gustav, maybe. 

The large one approached the door and I cursed myself under my breath. "Dammit, just let me rot". I listened from the second floor as his steps traveled up the porch and up to the front. Three knocks, loud and clear cutting through the quiet of the surrounding forest. 

The other three in his group now approached too. I could hear them below. "Maybe nobody's home?" 

"No-no, I definitely saw someone. Second floor, no doubt in my mind." 

Three more knocks.

"Well if he's all the way out here there's probably a reason. Doesn't want to be bothered." 

A voice that I assumed belonged to the large one called out: "Look man we just want directions! This place isn't exactly easy to navigate." I did not budge. Did not even breathe. I had no use for company, especially not of this kind. 

"Alright fine! If this spots abandoned then you wont mind if we take this deer hanging up out here then huh? We are pretty hungry." The deer, that was food for months if not more. Assholes. 

I tested my voice to myself, mumbling my script before saying it aloud. I had not been in conversation in quite some time. "go away...Go away...Go away please! I'm not in a mood for company!" 

"Ok then tell us how to leave!" This time a woman. I obliged, more to rid myself of the annoyance than to welcome the company. On my way down I grabbed an axe from the wall and strapped it onto my waistband. Better safe than sorry, not that they could if they tried. Going down the wood steps I was sure to stomp especially loud to announce my arrival, then I took a deep breath and threw the door back. 

Outside the group stood with confidence. One had made her home on the steps of the deck but shot up in surprise at my arrival. The big, shaved headed one seemed unimpressed. 

"So, how do we-" 

"Strange place ya got here! What are you some kind of monster lowering us in?" The girl who saw me before chimed in enthusiastically. 

"Uh..no. I am immortal, thats all." 

The deck grew quiet at my reply. The big one rubbed his neck, the girl stared wide-eyed, and the other two looked as if they were doing their best to avoid my eyes. I guess I was rustier than I'd thought, but all the better to get them to leave. 

"Right...so.... which way?" a map was placed in my hands. A rather bad map. No trails marked, no landmarks, in fact I was skeptical it was even a map of *this* forest. "Well, no way on here. The map is shit." As I spoke I could see the large mans eyes wander to my axe, his hand drifted to a weapon of his own, a large hammer resting in a loop at his hip. 

"What I mean is this is a bad map. You know what just, fuck it, come in." 

The girl with the oddly placed enthusiasm did not wait for any other words, she was practically inside before they finished leaving my mouth. The other two, brother and sister maybe, took middle, leaving the large man skeptically following behind. Something told me he was ready to take my head clean off my shoulders, something else said he'd be dead before he drew his weapon. By the time I entered they had already found seats in the living room. I came last, a guest in my own home. 

A part of me said it was good to have company again, or for the first time in this place rather. We spoke of many things, adventures and life. Of my thousand years in this world. And in speaking to them I began to remember things I forgot. Before long it went from a conversation to a monologue, their faces glued to my every word. Whether or not they believed me did not matter. It only mattered that I remembered what it was like to speak again. 

When they offered to leave I insisted they stay the night at least, the words poured from my mouth and felt a touch desperate, but they obliged. Then in the morning I led them back. 

But when I returned to my cabin I remembered what it felt like to feel loneliness again. To feel anything. So I left to find them once more, to take the journey once more, and to feel once more.
