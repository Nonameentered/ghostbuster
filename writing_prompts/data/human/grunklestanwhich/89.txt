The title "hero" meant a lot of things. It meant defending the weak, bringing bad people to justice, fighting for what one believes in; rarely did it ever mean defending ones self in court. Even more rare did it mean planting traps in the same court just before, but I was a thorough man, so being a hero recently had meant just that. 

As I was pulled up to the courthouse the car beneath us sputtered to a lazy stop. I could already see the crowds standing outside. The combination of both vulture and carcass, one ready to eat me whole, the other too clueless to know how. As the police vehichle rolled into its space I could see a few fingers go up and a series of heads turn in my direction. Before I knew it I was surrounded, the vultures trying their best to find any semblance of an identity on me, though I would give them no such ground. 

My mask was practically cemented to my face, and my backup mask underneath even more so. As I left the car the clamour of previously muffled voices filled the air. *Ground Zero how do plan to defend yourself- Ground Zero how do you feel about your appointed lawyer, Dempsey Gray*. I was used to chaos, god I practically thrived in it, but this was something else entirely. At the mention of Dempsey I almost turned in response, not because I knew the man, but because I was the man. Just my luck. 

As I shoved my way through the crowd accompanied by police the voices continued calling out in hope of any bit of meat they could cram down their endless gullets. Others yelled out in support, *Ground Zero, don't give em the mask!*, words that quickly turned into a chant through the crowd. I couldn't help but grin. 

Upon walking up the steps and entering that stone building my nervousness set in. I was going to court not only as Ground Zero, but as Dempsey, as me. If I pulled this off then it would be a greater feat than any arrest I'd ever made, and before I knew it, it was time. 

"Mr. Ground Zero, where is Dempsey Gray?" the judge above spoke as judges do. As if they know the answers but just want to hear you say it. 

"I'm unsure your honor. I can give him a call if you dont mind."

"Sure, proceed"

As I hit the button on my phone a rattling started from above. Up in the ceiling a series of sensors started to go off, shaking in the ducts one by one. After a moment the ceiling was vibrating so violently not a single face looked elsewhere, which was my cue. Quickly I shed my masks and stashed them under the table. I already wore a suit, so that was just a matter of removing the tie. Then with another press of my phone the shaking came to a slowed halt. The judge looked back down and practically jumped up from her seat. 

"Uhh Mr. Gray . Nice to see you. Where did your client go?" the court behind us whispered in confusion. 

"I believe he ran off to go check out the rattling. But we can proceed without for now." 

"Well you of all people know we can't. Not only that but your tie is on backwards now *Dempsey*". Shit. 

"Ah well thats just a matter of-"

"A matter of trying to fool the court? Do you really think us to be ignorant of your game Mr.Gray. And just what was your plan? A series of ever more complicated hijinks of switching between yourself and your alter-ego?" In my briefcase I glared down to the packs of smoke bombs, fire sprinkler switch, and itching powder. 

"As a matter of fact your honor...it was!" with a press of a button chaos erupted. The sprinkler valves flew open, releasing a rain of gray water. From somewhere above a loud boom sounded, releasing a rain of thick powder onto the crowd. With a handful of smoke bombs at the ready I made my dash for the exit, and thanks to the commotion was met by little resistance. The police that were meant to watch over me scrambled to readjust into something that resembled order, but all too late. I was out of the doors and on my way. 

I always hated court, thought that becoming a lawyer would mean putting away even more bad. Never thought I'd be the one people tried to put away. What I did know was that this plan, this chaos I enacted was much easier than court had ever been.
