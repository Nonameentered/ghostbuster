When I saw her I knew. There was no fear in her face, at least not the fear of me that most mortals showed. No, instead she appeared strong, especially considering the poor state she stood before me in. Sunken in cheeks, arms pulled thin as wire, blackened eyes. I knew when I saw her that she must be desperate. Desperate enough to call for help from an evil as notorious as mine. Despite the strength she showed, I was sure if she had tears to cry then they would flow like mighty rivers now, but no such theatrics came. Instead I had some of my own. 

*Who calls upon this power of mine. Souls taken, held from the divine. If vengeance be what you reap, then my power grants eternal sleep. Speak the words you came to say. Be true in request, have no delay* 

The words did not come from my husk, but somewhere far beyond, roaring through every crack of the tower and echoing out into the lands. I did not need to be reserved, for no being in a thousand years had contested my gaze. As my words finished a layer of frost began to lick at the corners of the room and spread. An unnatural blue light shined down somewhere from above casting an eerie glow across the little girls face. 

If she had been anything with misheld power, with hubris only a human could possess, then she'd see a performance that would strike fear into even the bravest of men. But for her this was more than enough. 

"What-what does reap mean?" she spoke, making herself even smaller. Though at my demonstration of power she didn't flinch, just stared into the empty sockets of my skull with big eyes. 

"It means to take. To end. What do you request?" my speech remained constant and loud. I wanted her request to be heard, and judging by the series of frantic voices down stairs it would be. 

"I don't know I just- I just wanted to-" she dropped to her knees. 

My voice lowered now to fill only the room, "It is ok my child. You have summoned me, and it seems your vengeance would be more than just. Give me a command and I shall enact, carry out, your will." Heavy footsteps coming up the stairs, fifteen pairs, maybe twenty. I opened my gaze and a part of my mind drifted out the door, granting me sight. My mind traveled the staircase until it revealed the source of the steps. A large group, armor clad, in full sprint up the steps followed in tow by a robed, frail man. I could end them now. Destroy the tower and take the girl. Destroy this entire...*kingdom*. The word was like poison in my skull. 

But I had a role to play. 

"I don't want to die here." now tears fell, riding along her protruding cheekbones and falling to the floor. I floated down to her side, and with a bony hand wiped a tear away. 

"Then you know what you ask of me." 

"I ask to live. I don't want to go like this" and that was enough. 

Once again my voice boomed. I watched as the armor clad men nearly fell back down the stairs at the noise. "Consider it done! You have made your request, now I have my fun." That stone laid room, the little girl whose name I did not know, all of it faded away as I fell into the floor and out elsewhere, into a throne room of extravagant cloth and colors. Before me a man, a worm, sat trembling on a throne. 

"Kn-knights! Return to m-" 

"They are frosted bones, broken on a staircase. They are piles of empty armor at their posts. Dead men led by a corpse." this time the words came from my bony mouth followed by a cloud of wicked smog. The frost followed me, breaking all it touched and I could hear frantic feet shuffling up from chairs behind. 

"P-Please. I can give you anything. Gold, power, an army." At the words he shriveled down into the plush of his chair. Pathetic. To think just a tower away sat a girl with infinitely more charity. With true courage. 

"I have already taken your offerings, your generosity is well considered, but you have only one thing I desire. To think, your daughter, *your blood* rots in a tower just steps away from here." 

The man cried out in horror as an army of bony hands sprouted up from the chair and his body was yanked down to the floor. He struggled, as all men did, his will against mine. For a moment he gained purchase on the floor and held himself afloat, a fools errand. For this was a fight I had never lost. I hovered down and placed a bony foot against his chest. "Welcome, to eternity." With a final push and an echoed scream he was gone. He was mine, and my vengeance was complete. 

I returned to the room where the girl still sat, no theatrics this time. She looked up to me with continued sadness. I had only one thing to say to her: "You know my name little one. Should you face this pain again, call on me, anytime.", and with a flash of blue light my work was final.

Edit: Thank you all for the kind words and awards! Always nice to know someone enjoys something I've done.
