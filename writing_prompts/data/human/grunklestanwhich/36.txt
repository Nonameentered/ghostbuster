The rope fit snugly around my throat, then was tightened to an uncomfortable degree. I thought to let out a cough, even if fake, just to make my discomfort known, but it did not matter now. Within the next five minutes I would be dead. Nothing but a lifeless husk swinging for the spectators to see. I thought it ironic that I had watched so many a man doomed to the same. 

As the husky man placed the rope around my neck he leaned in close, and with a quivering in his voice spoke. "I'm really sorry about this kid, I was rooting for you. We all were." I looked out to the crowd in surprise to see sadness on their faces. Some even seemed to be holding back tears.  

"Well if it's any consolation I was rooting for me too." I tried to muster up a clever grin but no such luck. This was it. 

The executioner walked over to his post, a tall lever connected to the gallows. I knew him I thought, seen him at other executions as the "so-called" hangman. Rupert maybe? He seemed a nice man despite his profession. Across, standing in powerful triumph was the lord, Gleise. I would say our lord but I had no such ties to the man. He looked almost annoyed to be here. As if watching my death was burden enough to him. At least we shared that sentiment, I didn't want him here either. So close to wiping the smirk from his face. So close. 

The hangman, Rupert, gave me a nod, which I returned. Typically the victim of such events did not get a nod, and I was thankful for the small consideration. Gleise gave out his final words, to which I hoped would not be the last I ever heard. 

"For the crime of treason. Of falsifying information and conspiring to assassinate the king. Of participating in the plot to blow up parliment, you are sentenced to death. Get on with it." the king shoed with a ringed hand. I was ready to go. Well...almost. A tyrant he was, and I'm sure some brave bastard would eventually do away with him, but why wait? 

As the floor dropped out from under me I fell fast, caught only by the rope. It hurt, unbelievably so, but I had not yet died. Instead I was just stuck gasping for breath in front of a crowd of onlookers. Most turned away, others cried, I could now see the misery on their faces. Maybe not for me, but for what would follow once I left. But hopefully that would not come. 

With all my might I tried to remain conscious. With my legs swinging I kicked until my arms faced the crowd. Some gasped, others ducked, and I could not see the lord. But it did not matter. I had practiced all week. With my last breath I pulled the trigger, letting out a flaming ball of my vengeance. Of my hate. My compliments to the hangman for fulfilling a dying man's last request. 

The last thing I heard before my breath ceased was: "He's been shot! Get him inside!" I was happy that it would be the last words I'd ever hear.
