I made an exaggerated face back at him, one with an opened mouth and obvious look of stupidity to emphasize my ignorance. He in turn stared back with real ignorance. 

"So then why the hell are you telling me this? Flexing your degree again?"

"Flexing? Ha! More like using." 

"Using? We're in a bar at 2:30 pm on a Wednesday. Nobody in here is using anything but meth." 

"That doesn't change what I was saying." 

I didn't know how to reply so I turned to the most reliable wrench in my toolkit: staying quiet as long as possible. With Drew though that was difficult. He was the kind of person that felt as if silence was an invitation to talk rather than just a moment of peace. As if the silence crushed upon him so heavily that if he did not speak he'd be-

"Do you want me to explain again? I'd be more than happy if you don't get it." 

"Thats condescending. I dont *need* to know. That's the issue. Where does this help me?" I reached over to my beer and took a long sip, fully expecting a speech in response straight out of a Stephen Hawking manuscript. Hell. I wouldn't even know if it was. I never even got passed the first chapter of *A Brief History of Space and Time*. Only checked it out to seem smart. 

"Well actually...", he started. *Ah shit, here we go.* "Actually it's the world Reese. It's about understanding the world. If you're against that then well...I can't help ya there. Just trying to teach you a few things." 

At the bar a few faces had come and gone during the course of our conversation (If you could call it that). In the moments of our talking I had tried to keep it quiet, as I always assumed anyone alone was always passively listening to what I had to say. But now? Now that it was just me and him I let loose, fueled by both annoyance and a slight buzz. 

"Drew. You aren't better than me because you can recite what some guy on YouTube or god forbid a fuckin' Wiki told you. I don't get this infinity shit and I don't care to. Just because you know something doesn't mean I want to or that I'll think you're smarter if you tell me. I already think you're smart." 

There was a long silence and a look of confusion on his face. Not Drew being confused, but literally his face not knowing what to do, caught somewhere between pain and pride. 

"Really? You think I'm smart?" he stared blankly to his beer, shuffling his hands around the bottle with unrest. 

"You just recited thirty minutes of infinite number theory to me. So yeah, smart. Annoying, sure, but smart...Ya know what? Next rounds on me. Cheers, to that big annoying brain of yours." 

He raised his beer, the tinges of sadness on his face that had previously been there now washed away. 

"Cheers! To you knowing shit and me listening...at least most of the time." 

We clinked our drinks and took a long sip together.

 

**Disclaimer** When it comes to math of any capacity I have smooth, stupid brain. My avoidance of the topic of infinity was both a way for me to write a coherent story and to avoid being thrashed by those not mentally challenged by math. Enjoy.
