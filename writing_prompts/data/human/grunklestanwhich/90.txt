The streets were exceptionally busy this time of day, near lunch they always were. Various people of every conceivable kind crowded the pavilion watching the variety of performers that lines the walls. Sometimes I'd watch as a random face in the crowd looked down to their watch, back up to the performer they stood in front of, and to their watch once again before running off in a hurry. It always gave me a chuckle to see. To know that the performers here were so entertaining that some would risk their jobs just to watch-on. 

Today was especially lively; a group of gold painted men stood in front of the bank and mocked the suited men that came in and out, to which a sizeable crowd cheered. In the corner a mime with a crowd of children pretended to be locked in a box running out of air, a bit morbid it seemed, but the kids appeared to enjoy it. 

Then, while analyzing the crowd I heard a familiar noise ring out in the pavilion. The sound of a full orchestra. Trumpets blaring, drums thumping, flutes willing sound into the wind. I knew the unnatural sound of the orchestra. The "one-man band" he had called himself, or at least that's what his label used to read.

I strolled over to admire his unnatural skill as I used to do, dropping a handful of bills into his open saxophone case that seemed oddly full for him having just started. "It's nice to see you still playing." His melody came to a grinding halt, leaving just the slow beat from a drum remaining. *He* stopped, now staring at me with a flute hanging from his agape mouth. The drums on his back came to a halt and we were left in silence. 

"Why do you remember me?" his face had gone pale. 

"Oh...uh. Well I used to watch you play a lot from over there." With a point I gestured back to where the gold men continued their show. "I gave you money a few times t-" 

With a series of bangs and clashes One-man band shuffled closer. Every step he nearly tripped on one of the many instrument cases that littered the ground around his feet. 

"No, but you remember me. You really know who I am! Oh no...thats no good." I thought his face seemed pale before, but now it grew unnaturally so. Thick beads of sweat pooled on his forehead, and now that I thought about it I never remembered seeing him sweating before. Never even saw him show fatigue. *What a god-awful amount of training he must have done*, I had thought at the time. 

The flute that was barely held between his lips fell to the floor. Then the drums, then an avalanche of noise as the rest followed down. One-man band didn't seem to notice though. Instead he kept his wide eyes locked with mine. 

"Listen man. Get yourself together and go! Dont stop, don't come back, just go." as he spoke he fiddled with the instrument cases all filled with cash. 

"What do you mean?" 

"I can't make it any more clear than that! You just need to listen and go. And by no means touch those things!" He flicked the last case shut, slung it over his shoulder, and disappeared into the crowd behind. 

I was left there. Left with a myriad of dented instruments and a million questions. He said not to touch those "things", but they seemed harmless. Well that and if I left them someone else was bound to touch it first. Or maybe I just wanted an excuse. No, I had to move them. They called to me. 

With a shaky hand I reached for the dinged flute, holding my breath as if it'd jump out and kill me. Touching it it felt warm, good, almost too good. I thought if I tried then maybe I could play it, and when I brought it to my mouth my feelings were confirmed as a beautiful piece shot out from nothing. 

Then another instrument, and another flew up to my body, one by one until my body looked as his did, coated in a blanket of musical equipment. Each time a new one joined with me it began playing its individual part. A voice called out from somewhere in the distance, maybe from the beyond, maybe from the instruments themselves. The voices gritty tones were only enhanced by the sound of my new song. 

*Congratulations One-man band. Once you repay me for my gift then you may leave. Until then, enjoy your new song.* 

So I stood and played. It could've been worse. Even if my company didn't stay long, remember my face, at least they watched.
