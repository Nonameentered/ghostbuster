On the table beside my bed I tinkered with a variety of scrap metals: shavings from an axe, a strip of metal cut from a knights helm, and a small pile of bearings. The bearings seemed to work best in the shells, they were certainly the most easy to load anyways. I scooped up a mixed handful and shoved it down in that little red tube. That was the beauty of the shotgun (or Thunderstick if you're a local): it was so simple that it even made scraps deadly. 

With my ammo ready I began donning my plated armor, on the chest displayed proudly was the knights crest: for most it appeared as an armored man kneeling with sword in hand, the tip buried in the ground. Mine was different however. A knight was on it, yes, but instead he carried the Thunderstick. And rather than kneel he stood tall amongst his kneeling comrades. Every other crest on every other knights chest could be any knight shown kneeling, but mine? Mine was inscribed with me. 

Beyond the wooden doors of my chambers was war, was death, was an infinite circle of murder that I had somehow become known to be the best at. Little did they know that my power only lied in their ignorance. Anyone could use the Thunderstick, I was just the one lucky enough to find it first. I turned back to the woman still half buried under the blankets of my bed on the way out the door. 

"I'll be back. You may leave whenever. Don't touch my things." I spoke through my helmet 

She turned groggily and stiff and looked up to me, her eyes adjusting to both the sunlight blaring into the room and my new look. 

"Alright Sir Moss, be safe! If you return then maybe so shall I". She gave a wink, and I was off. 

I made my way to the field. The battle would start soon and if I was not there, well, it made things quite a bit more difficult for all of us. I still remember years ago at the Battle of Derry. The Thunderstick had not been working properly and instead I had to take up a sword. It felt so unnatural in my hands in the years since I'd used one. And then, a massacre followed. Men, my men slaughtered due to my own errors. But no, not today, today I brought enough for everyone. Today I ensured our victory. 

Down the cobblestone halls the faces I passed stared up to me. I marched proudly, hands gripped to the wood etchings of the Thunderstick and displaying the row of shells strapped to my chest. As I moved forward I passed my fellow knights, lining the sides of the castle halls in stiff compliance. Each I moved by fell in line behind until we made up a small army marching forward in metallic unison. 

We marched on until we reached the front doors, massive arched doors that needed ten men each to push through. The creaked open slowly, five men heaving on each side. Sunlight poured it, followed by the scent of crisp air. The cold of the snow. But further, further still passed the white expanse, we're the outlines of the enemy marching forward. 

I turned to my men, who looked to me.

"This! This was given to me by the gods!" I held up the Thunderstick high. "Would the gods give me such a tool if they intended us to lose?" 

*No!* the men shouted in unison, a few standing taller as I spoke to the sea of armor. 

"So, if the gods are on our side...then how can we lose? The answer?: We cannot! Show the heathens at our gate that we are the chosen. Show the ungodly why we are here still!" 

A roar of agreement from the crowd of men. Then we began our stand, lining in front if the castle walls, me at the front. I snapped the Thunderstick in half, triple checking the rounds I had loaded. My heartbeat thumped so loud the echo filled my armor. My breath felt heavy in my helmet. But the Thunderstick was comfort. 

If only they'd known where I'd gotten the Thunderstick. Where I'd acquired the taste of godhood. Not from a god, but from a man, an ancestor he'd said. 

*Take this. If not you end our bloodline here and now. I do not need you to be brave, or strong. But live, for us.* 

I looked out to the field of enemies. They were nothing in the grand scheme. Just more bodies in an infinite sea. Just another forgettable moment in time.

Ripeth and Teareth, till its done.
