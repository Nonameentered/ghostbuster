The hordes of soldiers ran by, adrenaline coursing through their veins. It coursed through mine too. This was one of the many things that connected us.

I had prayed yesterday, prayed this morning too; to no god but rather to the blade in my grasp. Prayed it would bring me strength and calm in my battles today. Prayed it would keep my brethren safe, and so it would. More of the enemy ran by. These ones in a full sprint, all too focused on the line of soldiers behind me rather than the threat before them. For many of them it would prove their demise, after all, there was a reason I was sent first. 

Once again I prayed: "Let your might be true. Let my actions guide thee straight and let you be an extension of my righteousness. Let my enemies be known as equals." With my words the blade swung forward in a wide arc cleaving the closest man in two, then another, and another. The more it swung the wider the next mans eyes became as he too approached his doom.

The bodies piled and men opposite turned on their heels before even reaching me. The army behind me didn't even bother approaching, for they both knew and felt relief that the battle had once again ended early. That is why my blade had never failed for it worked only to protect the men of my kingdom. To save the innocent. 

On the battlefields horizon I spotted a lone soldier, a figure alone in the distance. This final soldier approached me through the chaos of the battlefield, large and grim. Where the others ran he walked. As his large figure moved closer his men parted like the Red Sea, until finally he stood before me. To my surprise he sheath at his side was hollow, the loops for axes at his waist empty too. 

"You! You are quite a warrior!" he yelled over the clamor of his men. 

"I only fight for what is honorable!" 

His voice lowered, but I could still hear his words. "Oh? And who decided that?", as he spoke his steps grew closer. "Honorable? Do you believe you to be honorable?" closer. 

I let my prayer begin again, this time rushed, trying to get the words out as the mans speed grew: "Let your might be true. Let my actions guide thee straight and let you be an extension of my righteousness. Let my enemies be known as equals." 

He was upon me now, and I could now tell he stood several heads larger than I, but I had my sword. I had my honor and prayers. With a wide arc I started my swing. The sword grew close. I held my breathe, so did he, I thought. Then, for the first time, it failed. My blade met its mark but did not pierce him, instead it simply pressed up to his skin. 

"You have no more honor than I. You are just a man, as I'd thought." 

I continued to press the blade to my opponent with all my might as it continued to fail. He stared down to me in seeming dissaproval, his warm eyes growing cold as he reached into his belt and removed a blade of his own: a small dagger of sleek steel. He brought it overhead and prepped for my demise. Then, just as he completed his arc the sword glowed bright, cutting through his stomach in a series of stalling, jerking motions. He let out a soft *Uhhgh* before dropping to his knees then to his face in the dirt, the dagger clattered down beside him. 

I had won. My sword had guided me and my honor had beaten his, even if just barely. I did not know how the sword judged, but I knew that I was thankful it had done so in my people favor in that moment.
