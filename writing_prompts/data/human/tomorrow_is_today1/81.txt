For short pieces, especially ones that don't connect to anything (which is most of my prompt responses on WP), I basically just choose the setting based on the vibe of the story and what I feel like writing. I'll be pretty vague with it overall, but sprinkle in details like how the sky looks, what the light levels are, what pretty trees are nearby, stuff like that. The sorts of details that I'm familiar with from real life and can describe well.

For longer, more involved pieces, it's a part of the story as much as anything else and so when I'm determining what it will be I think about the role that the setting plays. What elements of setting are important to the characters' lives and how they interact with each other, where are there differences and of what sort and how does that impact the characters, all that fun stuff.

I also will occasionally try out symbolism via nature (usually weather).
