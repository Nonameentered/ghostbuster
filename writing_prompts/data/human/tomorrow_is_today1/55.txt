I've loved Talking Tuesday! It's so cool to see all these extra takeaways.

For me, the thing I've probably improved at the most over the past year has been editing/revising. Being able to recognize what exactly is wrong with a piece and what can be done to change and improve it is so much better and more motivating than just feeling like something's wrong but not knowing what. It really helps my confidence as a writer, and it's changed my process. Still got further to go, of course, but I'm way better at it than I was a year ago.

I think the moment from Talking Tuesday that's stuck out to me the most was in the [Creativity](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/tey14c/ot_talking_tuesday_thinking_creativity/) discussion. I know that's not a tutoring post, but I loved the exercise that sevenseasaurus mentioned about putting a bunch of circles on a page and turning them each into different drawings. I currently use a similar exercise quite often, one I heard somewhere where you describe one thing in many different ways (ex: a dog, a ball of fluff, man's best friend, four-legged furry companion, etc.). There was also some great discussion in the post about creative slumps.
