I'm so glad you made it through! This was my first place vote. When I was taking notes on each story for voting purposes, I think my notes for this one were something along the lines of "I LOVE THIS SO MUCH" followed by "NOOOOOOOO", haha! I liked the decision to format it via journal entries, and thought you handled it pretty well with the character voice and the timeline. The section at the end was a bit unexpected, so I wonder if it might have helped to include a bit at the very beginning of Jess finding and opening her grandfather's journal.

Loved the story! Good luck with round 2!
