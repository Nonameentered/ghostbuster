I looked through my old notebook today.

It was an interesting mix of writing, drawing, and pictures, tons of pieces taped in because I refused to use glue. I didn’t believe glue would work, thought it’d peel off, and I’d get my hands all sticky for nothing. It got me in trouble a few times in school, actually - this was around middle school when I made the notebook. Who knew not following instructions could lead to consequences?

I suppose it wasn’t really the glue thing that got me in trouble. It was more of a philosophy of mine, applied to all sorts of stuff. I had to do things my way. So I would refuse to write up notes on passages we read in English classes because “I remember it well enough”, and I refused to ever use those planners they gave us because “I can remember my assignments without writing it down”, and I never brought a calculator to math class because “I’ll just do it in my head”. That went real well when I took a test that required a square root down to two decimal places.

It’s weird to think how much confidence I had in my own head. My own intelligence, my own memory. Everyone had always told me I was smart, and I knew it was true. Even with my disobedience, I skated by in my classes because the standards at which the material was taught just didn’t match where I was. It’s so weird to think how much I felt on top of the world back then. I had no clue what it was to be floundering about without direction in a class moving too fast and struggling to understand or get by. No clue what it was to be embrangled by an overload of commitments and concepts, trying desperately to hold onto all of them until the semester was over.

I assumed it’d be easy forever. I was wrong. Clearly.

But even while I can explain all of these things, pinpoint how I felt and when, looking through that old notebook felt strange and distant to me. It actually hurt. There were so many memories, so many thoughts that I had back then that I just forgot about. Like, I said I used to feel on top of the world. But then why did the notebook compare me to people I hated, describe myself as ‘out of the loop’ and ‘socially inadequate’ and ‘unwanted’? I can’t believe I even used the phrase ‘socially inadequate’ as a fucking eleven-year-old. But I did.

And I guess it makes sense, because that’s how I experience the world - in the present. I have never been such a real person as I am today. I guess I just wonder who that other person could have been, had things gone differently.

And I guess I wonder, if I could forget these things that were in the notebook, well, you know how much I believed in my own memory back then. I didn’t think I had to write things down to remember them forever.

So what else have I forgotten that never got written down?
