Light is not illuminating.  
It grants no gifts of sight  
nor of beauty  
as its waves fall down upon you.

Light is a trickster  
changing appearance at different angles  
overlapping itself in patterns of interference  
and shining so bright into the lens  
that it blinds what sight there is.

Light is harsh.  
It presses at the pain between your temples  
behind your eyes  
finding the worst of your feelings and turning up the dial  
until youâ€™re nauseous under the covers  
the tiny holes in the blanket your enemy.

When light is in charge,  
you forget how to trust your gut  
your balance  
you fool yourself into thinking the very thing you hide from  
shaking alone  
is a gift to your life.

Give me darkness.  
Give me shadows.  
Give me gentle breaths of relaxation  
cloudy skies and faltering rain  
let me see  
let me *breathe*.
