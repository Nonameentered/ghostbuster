We are not the default.

Main characters that look like us,  
behave like us,  
think like us,  
are worthy of a headline.  
It’s so unusual  
unexpected  
like we’re “exotic”  
and that’s our only source of worth.

Too many of us existing  
or characters like us being written  
is considered unrealistic,  
an agenda,  
a threat.  
God forbid a character not look like the exact same boring cracker  
or your insecurities won’t be able to stand that it isn’t about you.  
Oh, you idiot.  
*It isn’t about you*?  
Try feeling that with every piece of media.  
Try being rejected not because your story sucks,  
but because it includes people like you  
and that’s considered ‘risky’.

When characters like us are included,  
it is given a headline  
and scrutinized.  
Intersectionality is unheard of -  
after all, *we don’t want to go too far from the default*  
And every portrayal is very specific  
following stereotypes or hopes  
with the weight of every unrepresented person  
on a single character  
as if it can possibly encapsulate the experiences and personalities of a diverse group of people.

Even as it is, the few characters that exist  
are celebrated  
possibly more than they deserve.  
The conversation around human rights is shifted to representation  
like seeing a character on-screen can soothe a mother whose child was murdered  
soothe a child alone and shivering with nowhere to go  
soothe a man denied necessary healthcare.

Visibility plays its role  
but do not pretend ‘occasional’ is good enough  
and do not pretend like characters matter more than human lives  
It is not just in media  
that we are not the default.
