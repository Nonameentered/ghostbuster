I finish tying up the ropes and gag for my newest victim. Not that I need them that much. Picked up the little bugger unable to even stand by himself. I told the woman nearby that I was his friend and concerned he’d been roofied, so I was taking him home. One of those things is true. And he’s definitely not my friend.

I walk into another room to grab my tools. I put them here instead of storing them in the same room so I don’t have to look at the people I pick up before *exploring* them. Since I saw them when I picked them up, it’s only logical I should then take a break by walking into another room before it begins.

The skylights in the two rooms are providing more light than usual. Must be a clear night or something. I don’t really believe that much in moonlight.

As I turn back toward my victim, I hear him growl. Who knew he’d be awake so early? Unexpected, but perhaps this will be more fun. I grin as I walk in.

And then my grin is gone.

Dark fur erupts from his skin, and I could swear that little man has grown a foot in the time since I last saw him. His hands more like claws, his face lengthening into a snout…

Goddammit. I picked up a werewolf.

Dropping my bags, I fish out the chains while he bites through his ropes and launches toward me. I slide to the side.

Twice. This has happened twice now. What is my luck? They can’t be that common, can they? (I mean, I have killed over twenty…)

I reach up to try and wrap the chains around him, but I’ve lost my balance and only manage to use it as a barrier for myself against his teeth. I scramble backward as he howls and claws at me, sending me sprawling across the ground and into the wall. Already giving up on him, I start wondering about the skylight. Could blocking that help? I’ll be damned if I have to start keeping track of moon cycles.

Leaving me on the ground, the werewolf howls and bounds outside. I hope this werewolf experiences amnesia, but on the side, even if he doesn’t, I know he won’t be believed. I laugh at that, wheezing a little as I pull myself into a sitting position. I’ll keep going. I have more people to take.

It’s only after several minutes go by sitting there that I realize what the pool of blood coming from my neck and back means. I fall back to the ground and lie on my side.

*No. Not yet.*

God…damn…werewolves.
