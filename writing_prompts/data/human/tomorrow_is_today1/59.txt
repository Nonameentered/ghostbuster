Really fun story! I believe this is one that I voted for (the top three were super close). Very cool and interesting, this one definitely stood out among the stories in the heat. I was a bit confused in the first paragraph by the Afterburner, Bookkeeper, and Bootstrap bit.

Loved the imagery and the ending! And the POV, I thought the voice was very unique.
