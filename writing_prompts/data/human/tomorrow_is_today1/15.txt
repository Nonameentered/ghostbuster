Damn, I love this. The rhythm & sound is spectacular and it's so fun to read aloud.

The stones really tied the piece together, and I loved your imagery. "My gaze cascades, forced repentance straightaway, / as weighted stones contort my spine and cripple brittle bone." -- so good! I admit I had to reread the piece (and look up 'cairn') to really get it, though that isn't necessarily a bad thing.

I really haven't got crit. Good words!
