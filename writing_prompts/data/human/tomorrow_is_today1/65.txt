“We dragons, we’re not just some man eating monsters!” The light creature shifted its back wings, settling into a sitting position on the cliffside. Its scales reflected the gentle orange hues around us, and I couldn’t help but notice how pretty it was.

“So,” I said, “Do people just make that up?”

“Well, no, not really. You humans are delicious. There’s just more to us, y’know?”

I crouched next to the dragon and looked out at the green tinted morning sky. “I hear you.”

We sat in silence for a moment. I hugged my knees and sat. “I’m uh, I’m definitely familiar with the whole being seen as a monster thing.”

“You? But why you? You’re human.”

I chuckled half heartedly. “Yeah, well.” I spun my bracelet around my wrist. “People tend to turn against each other a lot. So…”

“So they turned against you.”

I nodded.

“Is that why you’re out here? I don’t see humans around here very much, I think they’re afraid of me.”

“Oh they definitely are.” I stretched my legs out and turned toward the dragon. “And well, they didn’t send me out here or anything, but. I guess they kinda are the reason I’m here. I just kinda…gave up. Y’know?”

The dragon turned its six eyes toward me. “I’m glad you’re still here, human. Even after giving up.”

I felt the heat behind my eyes before I felt the emotion. This dragon, supposed ‘monster’ that I’d just met…it cared more than any person. Fucking sad, yet all I feel is relief.

I crawled closer to the dragon, and it wrapped its nearest front and middle wings around me, like a mom’s protection or a hug. We stayed there for a long time, the dragon’s warmth and stillness slowly lessening my shivers.

“What, um. What should I call you?” I asked. “Like a name, and pronouns.”

My friend stirred. “You can call me Sunrise. And any pronouns work for me, whatever beings you comfort.”

I smiled. Sunrise. So beautiful. “I, um,” O said. “I’m Roe. I think I’ll use they/them. Never really had a choice before.” I chuckled again, and sat up from that curled up position I’d been in for who knows what amount of time. The sky was yellow and blue now, and I watched it as my cheeks dried.

“Stay with me, Roe,” Sunrise said. “You are in need. I have had a friend give up completely before.”

Sunrise paused to look down at me. I wonder if practice will help me decipher dragon expressions. I don’t even think I can decipher human ones.

“You are still here,” Sunrise said. “And you are my friend now. So stay.”

I looked out at the cliff’s edge again, at the open air beyond.

“I will stay.”
