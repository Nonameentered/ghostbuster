"How much do you need? Hours? Days? Weeks?"

I chuckled at the appropriately time-old joke as she led me to the kitchen. Her house was open concept, and rather than a TV her living room was occupied with a long fold-out table covered in art supplies. She still had a couch. Gotta be comfortable when making art, I suppose.

"Just enough thyme for supper," I responded as she reached the light-colored cabinets of her kitchen. Plates and snacks lightly scattered, otherwise clean, it didn't look too different from my own. Looks like she's well settled in, even if we don't quite know each other very well yet. I hope that changes. It's been a while since I've painted.

She measured out some thyme for me, confirming I had what I needed, then placed it in a little baggy - we both laughed - and handed it over.

"You'd be welcome to come over for supper if you'd like. With the last ingredient," I held up the bag, "there's more than enough for one more person."

She smiled. "I'll think about it. When are you having supper?"

"Just in an hour or so. I can let you know."

"That'd be wonderful. Thank you."

"Of course! Always great to get to know people around the neighborhood. And you got the thyme, after all, be almost unfair if you don't get to eat it."

She laughed at that, and we walked back out toward the front door and said so long, see you at supper.

As I walked back to my house, the air felt a little less chilly.
