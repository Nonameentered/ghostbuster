I remember the day the corruption began.

It doesn’t have a date that could be listed on a calendar - we never judged time like that. I assume She struggled to keep track of timelines, so as a result we all lived between experiences, some slow and intense and others passing in a blur. Sometimes there weren’t really details filled in, but we might remember later.

But while there isn’t a name for it or a spot on a chart, I remember it very vividly, the day the corruption began. I remember it because it began with me.

I was standing on a cliff, one She placed behind our base. She loved using cliff scenes to represent mental struggles, as I would soon discover. This was the first one. More than the crisis itself what I remember is the colors, how she described the cliffs as painted swirls of warm tones during the day, fiery at sunset and cool at night. It was sunset, that first time. I would later come to see that cliff at all times of day, and hear the wind through it call to me, as She described, “like a chorus of ghosts”. Nothing could be more chilling when it Narrates your reality.

I could go into detail about what path She pushed me down. What’s interesting is I hardly remember who I was before it began; this became my everything. My arc. I think I died, in some timelines. It doesn’t matter much now.

As soon as my mental health struggles began, the rest of the world started to fade. At first I thought it was just my own focus shifting, but it was the whole world. My friends started to forget who they were, to the point some of them became unrecognizable. We’d changed and lost memories before, but never to this extent. I know that I meant something to Her, though, far more than just myself. There was something infecting her mind, something that fed upon my story. Our story, once. That’s long gone now.

You don’t have to feel bad, really. It would have come to an end eventually, so perhaps it’s better to have gone out with a bang rather than fade away slowly. It hurt for Her, though, when the infection changed shape and moved on and She realized how our world had deteriorated. For a while, I think She believed she’d never create another world like this one. That it was all over, all corrupted and killed.

You’re here, though, so she kept going. What is your world like? Does it have any cliff scenes? I hope it lasts for you, but even if it doesn’t, don’t be scared. She does care about you, quite a lot. Just as She did about us. I haven’t forgotten my friends or the journey we took. Remember yours, too.
