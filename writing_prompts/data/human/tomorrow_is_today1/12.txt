“Such a flaw it is to be
/ writing out this poetry
/ When the one I love is not supposed to be for me.

Oh, how tempting to twist fate!
/ imagining she isn’t straight
/ imagining we have a chance as something not just friends.

I know to say this isn’t right
/ I should just let her sleep the night
/ in her own bed, but something calls me to write.

I long to spend my days with you, to wake up between soft sheets together. I want to be allowed to stare deeply into your eyes.

I want moment upon moment together, making you laugh and blush and smile, it would all feel worth my while to know that you chose me.

But you won’t, and I can’t force a thing, so I’ll tear up the parchment after writing and give you the chance to choose who you like. But I can’t kill my hope one day she’ll be I.”
