It was a beautiful sky, that evening as we sat together outside our building. We’d been roommates for months - god, it’s so stupid funny. Roommates.

The sky shone so huge in its gentle light and darker blues, and it tinted the air with its shade. I wondered how long it would take to go from blue to pink. I planned to stay out here and watch it the whole way through.

One look at you, and I knew you wanted the same. Your brown eyes, so wide and dark in the dim light, shone with wonder as you gazed with your head tilted back. I froze, captivated. I don’t want this to end. I don’t want to walk away with nothing changed.

I scooched closer to you, my leg brushing yours and resting on it. You smiled and turned.

We held eye contact. I don’t want to look away. I don’t want to give this up. I don’t want this to end with nothing.

You raised your hand to my cheek, and I felt myself melt into it. I pointed at my mouth, and at yours.

You nodded.

This won’t end with nothing. We won’t walk away the same.

The sky turned us pink as we shared our first kiss.
