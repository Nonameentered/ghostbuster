Sure. I'll write wherever as long as I have stuff to write with. I always keep a mini notebook and a pencil with me, and in some situations I use it as a form of escapism from whatever environment I'm in. I've written at home, at the library, in class, visiting family, at an open mic night, out on a walk, plenty of places.
