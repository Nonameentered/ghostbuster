Recently my climate of emotions has shifted back to that black sea

the sea of swimming ghosts without temperature or clarity

Yet the clarity of my feeling seems actually to have increased

\- at least, increased from the prior state of blank confusion and numbness.

Numbness is a curse far worse than this weight

after all, weight is like a weighted blanket helping you sleep at night

and this night,

this night is my home.

Even if home is a dark, unenviable place

the place you find yourself in when the call of the void starts to sound sweet

So, so sweet the thoughts are, for someone with flickering hope

but the hope is at least there, somewhere, for now.

In fact, now I have heard so many stories of people who've been here

while I'm here their words act as a sort of lifeboat to keep me from drowning.

I've been drowning for so long.

So, so long.

Yet long is not forever, right?

Isn't it right to hope, to dream, to hold on just one more day?

One more day is what they tell me.

And me, I just keep holding on.

Holding on as I drift this endless black sea,

the sea of swimming ghosts as they're calling to me.
