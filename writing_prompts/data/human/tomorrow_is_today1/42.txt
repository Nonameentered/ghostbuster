I loved this story! I think you handled the structure very well while keeping it in the word count limit, which is impressive. I think my favorite thing about this piece is the character voice - I could totally hear it in my head, and I felt it really fit and you did a great job with it.

I also like the way you started and ended it the same way with "...worst year ever!" to "...best year ever!". I like how that tied it together and showed the change between the beginning and end.
