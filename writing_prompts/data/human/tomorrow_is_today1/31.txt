“He’s not like you,” my mom always said about my twin brother. “He functions differently because of his Autism. That’s why he can’t be in your classes; he just doesn’t understand.”

And growing up, that was what I believed. My brother was simply not normal, not able to be understood. He couldn’t communicate like we could, couldn’t learn in his classes. Of course, I never saw what his classes looked like until later.

Funny how your assumptions become self fulfilling.

When we were little me and my twin were inseparable. If one started crying the other joined. I used to copy his every move, from peeing on the pediatrician right after him when we were born to watching him learn to crawl and then imitating him so I didn’t have to learn all by myself. When I first went to a daycare without him, I bawled and bawled. Without my parents was fine, but without my brother? It wasn’t until we got older that things changed. We were placed in different classes, told different things about ourselves, given different labels. His was “Autistic”. Mine was just “awkward nerd”. At best.

As we got older I felt more and more pressured to be the normal, functioning person I was supposed to be. After all, *I* wasn’t the Autistic one. I was supposed to be smart, capable. Whenever my mom was around I started to treat my brother the same way she did, with that high voice you use for a child and the pointed questions about what he wanted, using your fingers as options: index for food, middle for water, ring for head squeezes for his headaches. Viewing him as other, as someone who had to be spoken to differently. It was much easier when we were alone. I usually didn’t speak at all. Neither of us did.

But even as I tried harder, I always felt like I didn’t quite fit to that standard of normal. I excelled in my classes (though to do so became more and more difficult once I reached high school), but I couldn’t make friends. Every time I tried it would start out normal and then I’d unknowingly say something weird or not say something when I should have or use the wrong amount of eye contact or regular contact and then it would end, horribly. It always came out of nowhere. So I learned to be alone. I stayed quiet in my classes, knowing the backlash I’d receive otherwise for being a nerd or being weird or whatever word they used that time. I was finding it so hard to focus in class I had headaches all the time. I could ace tests but couldn’t get my homework done - every assignment was either outstanding or unfinished.

One time when I was still in middle school I got to visit the classes my brother was in. I saw the special needs room and the aides and the occupational and speech therapist. I went into it with that “Autism family member” idea my mom had instilled in me, ready to volunteer and feel all those soft “I’m a good person look at these precious people” feelings. And I went, and it was terrible. I kept wanting to change things for my brother, kept getting bored along with him and wanting to take us somewhere else. The aides didn’t care, the teacher only gave them first grade level materials to learn from, the therapist was overworked. And all this time I’d been lied to. I was told my brother just didn’t understand things at the same level. But they didn’t even try to teach!

I started to miss those moments alone with my brother, started to seek them out again more. I felt safer. My mom wasn’t there, no teachers or classmates around. I could pace the house and sing and my twin would do the same. We would sit across from each other to do a puzzle. Even outside of the house, I saw more and more moments where I wanted to just take us away. Classes with aides who actively made things worse. ‘Special Olympics’ events and assemblies that were overstimulating for us both. People who asked you to focus on pointless, below-you tasks.

I asked my mom recently why I never got a diagnosis. Did I even get checked out for one? Did she even try? I’m neurodivergent, aren’t I? So why am I breaking down with limited energy and focus and unable to even reach out for accommodations? Why am I excluded from the only spaces that even pretend to be designed for people like me because I don’t have a label? And why wasn’t my brother in my classes, or homeschooled, anything better than what he got?

You don’t get it, do you, mom? And I don’t get you either. I’m not who you said I was, who I was made to believe I had to be. I’m safer here, with my twin brother and no one else. He never tried to make me into someone I’m not.

He’s not like you.
