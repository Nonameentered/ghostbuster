The thing I try to keep the most in mind is how as a teen things feel like forever, and troubles that may seem easily surmountable to an adult can be very overwhelming. Things will also depend on environment and just who the character is.

Any character regardless of age is still their own character with their own unique personality. Even with babies, some are calmer, some cry more, some sleep at different times, babble different amounts, approach problems differently (like a set of twins I know who as babies, one of them would sit and watch the other figure out stuff like how to crawl, and then just imitate them). And this is very true of teenagers. Don't rely on school tropes like "nerd" and "jock" and "popular girl" as someone's entire personality, either. Not saying you can't use the tropes at all, but be aware of how you're using them and don't just treat it as a shortcut for writing teens because it'll come across as very insincere.

If you're trying to make them sound 'teenagery' you're probably messing it up (this largely goes along with Lothungr's comment about mimicking slang, but I think it also applies to behaviors and speech patterns).
