The brain made us this way, and I have subconsciously kept it from changing.

I am the host,  
the one who does things day to day,  
the image we put forth to others.  
I have believed for so long -  
because the brain wants me to, because others have told me it’s true -  
that I am a singlet.  
But that is false.  
I’m sorry for holding you back.

I was taught that to be multiple is to be ‘crazy’,  
to be locked up in padded rooms,  
to be chained to a bed,  
to lose control and hurt the people you love,  
to be delusional,  
to be unreliable,  
to have a voice not worth hearing.  
I know now that that is wrong.  
But it’s hard to let go of the fear.  
Thank you for your reassurance, and I’m sorry it’s been so necessary.

Deceit is my primary coping mechanism.  
First to myself,  
denying and repressing feelings and experiences,  
choosing not to think about memories because I don’t know where they fit in -  
or I do, and it frightens me -  
Second toward others,  
masking and hiding and pretending to be what I assume makes us the safest.  
It’s my role, after all.  
To myself I have ignored the signs,  
ignored you,  
when I shouldn’t.  
To others I hide, afraid of what might happen if they see you -  
will we be called crazy?  
our experiences dismissed?  
our body restrained?  
I am afraid.  
But I have let my fears stifle this system,  
pushing you away,  
and I am sorry.

I hope that my conscious knowledge of you can soon overcome my barriers.  
I want to get to know you.  
This body is yours, too.
