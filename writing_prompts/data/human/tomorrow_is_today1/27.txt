I was faced with a mirror, and looked too deeply into my own eyes, so now I am falling.

Twisted images of myself-not me and voices of my name flashed before me as I fell away from my eyes and gave away my stability to the mirror. I hear them calling me, “Annie boy”, “he she” with their threatening loud voices and I want to run.

I do not run.

I can tell by my feet and by the movement of the hallway around me passing by that I am moving slow, but it feels the other way. Like time was slowed down but I’m still fast processing. And the world, it tilts and blurs and spins as I make my way back to my room. I do not know where I am. I do know. I am here.

I move the homework off of my bed in plans to lie on my side, but move it back and sit at my desk. I have more work to do. It’s due tomorrow. It’s due at 3:30. It’s already almost midnight. My world keeps spinning.

I feel the need to catalogue my existence, to leave some mark that I was here. And here as the me in this moment right now, not as the others I live as day by day. They are not Annie boy. They do not remember. They do not know. They do not hear it, or see the flashing images laid out before them in a mirror swallowing them whole.

Maybe I should be grateful to the mirror that I am here in my current me state at all. Would I have been if it hadn’t stolen our stability, if our eyes were not too deep and too connected in their own reflections?

I cannot work. I cannot focus. The world is spinning. And I am falling.

It will not be a mirror again that takes me back away and rights the world to its normal, intangibly spinning state. It will not be a mirror that re-removes my awareness of the motion and sets things back into place, like a broken bone, like a jammed stapler, like something poking outside of its box. I will be righted, and it will be here, during the return to focus on our homework.

It always mattered more than we did.

Don’t make me go.
