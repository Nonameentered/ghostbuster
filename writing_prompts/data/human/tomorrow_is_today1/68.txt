Can't focus. Occasionally I'll try the excuse of I don't have ideas, but I'm really good at countering that one so I know it doesn't work against myself lol. I'm trying to find more / better strategies for being able to focus on things, but yeah, it's a bit difficult right now. And then I'll have a hard time sometimes determining "can I really not focus right now or am I just using that as an excuse to be lazy because there are other times when I really can't focus", so it's a whole thing.

A couple things that can help, though, are purposeful breaks (as in, I actually treat it like a break and not like "well I should be working right now but I'm not"), and setting a short timer for myself when I actually do work. I also gotta start working real quickly and not give myself too much time to think about it so I don't overthink myself into not working.
