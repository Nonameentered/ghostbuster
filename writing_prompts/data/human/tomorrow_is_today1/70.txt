I have a similar problem. Right now I'm actually taking a break from all my larger stories because of it, so while every once in a while I'll have fun ideas that I add to the documents, right now I'm just sporadically writing short pieces unrelated to anything. I really like the features on this subreddit for that, especially TT and Poetry Corner. But I don't pressure myself to write for them every week. I just try to trust that I'll write when I want to and that it's best for me to do everything I can to avoid it being an extra source of stress.
