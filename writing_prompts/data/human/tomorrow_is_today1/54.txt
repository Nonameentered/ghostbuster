Plan out the story, plan out the individual scenes, storyboard, create drawings. When drawing pages it can be helpful to keep in mind margins. Figure out a style of art and storytelling specifically in regards to comics that works for you. I'd recommend looking more for advice given by people who actually do comics. I think ABD Illustrates on YouTube has a few videos with some advice, but I'm sure there's far more out there if you look for it.

Comics can take a long time to make so be patient with yourself. Good luck.
