Jack laid his back against the thick trunk, enjoying the tree’s shade and twirling a leaf between his fingers. The leaves here didn’t have nearly as many spider eggs on them as the ones back home. The sky was brighter here, too - must be less pollution.

A few yards away from Jack, Rain stood at the edge of where the hill’s top was still flat, staring out at the sky or the steep decline - it was hard to tell which from how his head was turned. His shirt ruffled slightly in the wind, pressing against his shoulder blades. He reached a hand up to push his long curls behind his ear and glanced back at Jack with a half smile.

He was the most beautiful man in the world.

Jack’s heart fluttered and he stared at the leaf in his hand. It shuddered. His hands were shuddering. Funny how you can feel so hot and shiver so much at the same time.

Rain walked over and sat beside him, staying close by to be within the shade of the tree. He plucked the leaf from Jack’s hands and turned it over, holding it up to his eyes. He had taken off his glasses, he said to better see the colors of the sky. Rain’s eyes were dark and beautiful, and he looked at everything with such care and thoughtfulness. Every time those eyes turned to him, Jack felt his heart swell.

“Hey J,” Rain said with a grin.

Jack smiled. “Hey.”

“What’s on your mind? Dear friend. Treasured companion of mine. You’ve got that same look on your face like when you told me you were trans.” As Rain spoke, he turned his posture to face Jack fully, leaning sideways against the oak’s trunk.

Jack blushed. “You know me too well. Rascal.”

Rain laughed and leaned back a bit. “If you gotta wait a bit more and hang out first, we can do that too.”

“Nah, probably better to rip the bandaid off. I’ll be nervous this whole time. I just.” Jack sigh-laughed. “Ah. Bad at communicating. Words hard.”

Rain giggled and waited, looking into Jack’s eyes.

Just one little sentence.

No worrying allowed. Too late now anyway.

“I,” Jack said. “Rain, I think I’m - no, I am - *ah*.” He turned to face Rain, looking him in the eye.

“Rain,” Jack said. “I love you.”
