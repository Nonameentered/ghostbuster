"Hello, my name is Sophia. What's yours?" 

I looked around and saw her there, smiling up at me, hands folded primly in front of her. She stood between a man and a woman -- her parents, presumably, though she didn't much resemble the couple flanking her, who appeared to be in late middle age. Grandparents, maybe?

I smiled back at the little girl. She was a cute kid, in her little blue dress , with a matching bow in her hair. 

"Well hello, Sophia. I'm Aaron." I said, returning her wholesomely precocious greeting.

I thought her parents would find the exchange as charming as I did. My parents had always liked it when *I* acted friendly and polite, as a kid. To my surprise, they were suddenly glowering -- not at their daughter, but at me.

"How did you know her name?" her mother asked, suspiciously.

"She introduced herself. Just now." I replied, more than a little confused. I thought they had to have heard the girl. They weren't *that* old.

Sophia just kept smiling, as her parents glanced at each other, something unspoken passing between them. Her father, grandpa, or whatever, then shot me a hard look.

"Very funny, buddy." he said, flatly. "She hasn't been able to speak since she was a baby."

I just stared at him in disbelief, until Sophia broke the silence again. "Oh no! I'm sorry."

I turned back to the girl. Her smile had vanished, and she now hung her head, sadly.

"Sorry for what, Sophia?" I asked. When she didn't reply, I started to turn back to her parents. 

"Listen I don't know what's--"

I didn't get the chance to finish my sentence. I felt a sharp jab at my neck, like a beesting, and suddenly the world seemed to slip out from under me, and I fell into  darkness. 

As the void swallowed me, time seemed to slow down, and I heard snatches of conversation.

*He has to be...we'll get a sample of...*

*...he received...broadcast from the subject...*

*...reporting in...found one in the wild...we used the sedative...*

*...we need immediate pick up at...*


I was vaguely aware of the feeling of Sophia's parents grabbing hold of me on either side, and lowering me to the ground.

Before I was submerged in darkness, I heard her voice again.

*"I'm so sorry..."*
