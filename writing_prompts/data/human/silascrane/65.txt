Lucius Fox stared at the request sitting on his desk, "You want Wayne Industries to build you an AI backpack with inventory management software..." 

He looked up at the Hispanic girl, bemused. "How did you even find my office?" 

Dora grinned as she placed a scroll on the desk.

"It's alright, Lucius." Bruce Wayne said, raising a hand in greeting, as he entered Fox's office. "She's with me."

"Look everyone! It's my friend Mr. Wayne, again! *Es mi amigo, Senor Wayne."* Dora said, animatedly, turning to face the billionaire as he entered.

Lucius raised an eyebrow. "Bruce...?"

"This is Dora Marquez. She came to my office earlier this morning, asking for help." Bruce said, placing a hand on the young girl's shoulder.

"Ayuda!" Dora agreed, cheerfully.

"She came *alone?"* Lucius asked, incredulously, peering at the child.

Bruce nodded. "Don't let her appearance fool you. She may be a little girl, but she's also a metahuman, possibly mystical in nature -- I'll have to check with Zatarra, or maybe Nassour. In any case, it looks like she has a mental connection to some sort of hive mind that constantly perceives her immediate surroundings, and provides her with information."

"Si, I have *muchos amigos."* Dora explained.

The billionaire frowned, thoughtfully. "She also seems to be fully bilingual in English and Spanish, but she frequently communicates in a creole of both -- weighted more towards English than Spanish, often repeating phrases. Almost like she's trying to *teach Spanish."*

"Learning is fun!" she said, with a nod.

"So, a little metahuman girl just decided to walk into Wayne Enterprises, and ask us to design an AI backpack with inventory management? Because this...*document* told her to?" Lucius asked. He picked up the scroll the girl had set on the table, and unrolled it.

"It's blank." he said, looking back up at his employer.

Bruce shook his head. "Not according to her."

"That's Map!" Dora said. "He helps me to find my way!"

"One way this hivemind seems to communicate with her is by altering her perception of inanimate objects." Bruce explained. He gestured to a blue monkey plush toy held under her arm. "She believes *that* walks upright under its own power, and speaks to her, for example."

"But she doesn't seem distressed by you pointing out it's not real?" Lucius observed.

"I noticed that. I suspect the hivemind filters what she sees and hears, censoring references to itself or its tampering with her senses -- though, thus far, its purpose for doing so appears to be benign, at least as far as Dora herself is concerned. Apparently, it decided that she needs more help than it can provide her on its own -- it was most likely the hivemind, not Dora herself, that formulated the idea that she should obtain high-tech equipment."

"But why come here?" said Lucius.

"That's why I want to help her, Lucius. We need to find out more about these invisible entities giving her instructions. They...know things."

"What kind of things?"

Bruce turned to Dora. "Dora, can you tell me again what you asked...*'Map,'* that caused him to lead you to my office?"

Dora looked up at Bruce, beaming innocently. "Well, I knew that I needed to get a cool new backpack for my adventures, because all my *amigos* said so! So, I thought about who had the coolest gear and gadgets around. Then, I asked Map:  ¿Dónde está *Batman?"*
