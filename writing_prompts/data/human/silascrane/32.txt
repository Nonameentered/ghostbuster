The DiPalma-Spencer Hyperdrive worked flawlessly --  50% of the time. What exactly happened *the other 50% of the time* was anyone's guess. Ships that left simply never arrived at their destination, nor were they seen or heard from again. There was no reason for this aberration to be found in the equations that made faster-than-light travel possible.

While it baffled scientists, it gradually came to be accepted as the toll exacted by the universe in exchange for cheating the laws of physics by leaping almost instantly between destinations that were light-years apart. On average, only one out of four ships came back from a round trip.

And the Montezuma had made *two* round trips, already.

As she sat among the multitude of other desperately hopeful would-be colonists aboard the vessel, Dina told herself that Montezuma's past hyperjumps didn't matter. She remembered what the orientation team had explained, when they told her group they'd been assigned to the Montezuma: the Hyperdrive anomaly was random -- almost exactly like a coin toss, statistically. Every time you toss a coin, there's a 50% chance of getting heads, and a 50% chance of getting tails. 

Counter-intuitively, however, the probability of the current coin toss getting "heads" isn't affected by the outcome of prior coin tosses -- it's *always* 50%, no matter what. So, statistically, it doesn't matter if you've gotten heads four times in a row on the same coin -- the fifth toss is still no less likely to come up heads than it was before. 

And, in the Montezuma's case, it didn't matter that she'd already had four successful runs -- her chance of having a *fifth* run arrive safely at Proxima Prime, the fertile, resource-rich exoplanet that her passengers were risking everything for a chance to colonize, was still the same 50% chance it had always been. 

Dina and the rest of her group had *not,* the colonization team assured her, been cheated of their 50% chance to survive by being put on a ship that was "due" to be lost to the hyperspace anomaly. There was no such thing as being "due" for the anomaly to happen, statistically speaking.

That was what Dina told herself, as she felt the slight vibration through the ship that she'd been told to expect, the faint shudder running through the Montezuma that preceded the Hyperdrive activation. That was what she told herself, as the stars outside turned into lines of white stretching out into infinity, as Montezuma and all aboard her boldly defied the natural order of the universe, twisting space around them in multiple dimensions to bring their destination closer to them, without ever actually transgressing the unattainable speed of light. 

She almost giggled, more out of manic nervousness than actual mirth, as it occurred to her that she was, in some sense, a passenger aboard *a technicality.* 

Dina's heart skipped a beat, as she felt another shudder run through the ship. This too, she'd been told to expect. This second vibration preceded the hyperdrive powering down, as the first had heralded its activation. And then, she exulted, as the line of fleeing stars outside her window became a vast blue orb, adorned with emerald green continents, and crowned with spiraling wisps of pure white cloud. *Proxima Prime.*

The Montezuma decelerated in moments -- which made sense, since she had never been going very fast, to begin with, as far Dina understood it. The universe had moved *around* her. Dina joined in the cheer erupting from her fellow colonists, as they crowded around the windows, gazing in wonder at their new home.

And then, nearby, an old woman screamed. Most of the passengers were too consumed with the view and the raucous sounds of their own excitement to notice, but Dina heard it, and turned to look. 

The old man beside the frantic old matron tried to calm her, but she seized his arm and forcibly turned him towards the window she was looking out of, now crying incoherently, and jabbing her finger at the space beyond. Dina followed her gestures, but all she saw was Proxima Prime -- that, and other colony ships like the Montezuma, orbiting the verdant world until they were ready to return. 

There were more of those than she'd expected. With half of all ships lost to the anomaly, and far more people willing to take the risk than there were ships to carry them, turnaround was usually quick, for those vessels that survived a hyperjump.  But she still couldn't understand what had caused the woman's breakdown. 

She drifted cautiously towards the elderly couple. The old man was now clutching his weeping wife to his chest, and tears were streaming down his own wrinkled cheeks as he gazed out the window at the ships beyond.

"What's wrong?" Dina asked, gently, looking between the ships and the man and his wife. To her surprise, when the man turned to look at her, a joyful smile split his wizened face, despite his freely flowing tears.

"Wrong?" he said, with a joyful, almost manic laugh. "N-no, it's...it's the *Perseus!* Our son and his family made the trip aboard her. They told us it was one of the ships that was lost! But look, there! It's *here!* The Perseus *made it!"*

Dina looked -- he was right. "CTS Perseus", she could see it on the hull. But there must have been some mistake -- the ships that were lost were never heard from again. Were they? She squinted at the small swarm of colony ships she could see out the windows. She couldn't make out every name, but she could see some.

The *Aristotle...*wasn't that one of the lost, too? That one, and the *Myanmar --* that ship was here, too, but she was sure she'd heard in named among the litany of ships lost trying to attain the jewel of Proxima Prime. In fact, *all* the ships she could see were among those that had been reported as lost. Dina placed her hand on the window, as though trying to reach out and touch the vast blue-green orb that dominated her view. Slowly, her hand trembling, she traced the outline of the continents on the planet's surface with a fingertip. Their shapes, she found, were unfamiliar, completely unlike the images of Proxima Prime she'd studied over and over, in preparation for her voyage.

All at once, Dina realized that she now knew what happened to hyperdrive vessels, exactly 50% of the time. 

What she *didn't know,* was where the hell she was.
