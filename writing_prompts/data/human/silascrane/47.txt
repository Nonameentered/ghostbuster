"Welcome to *Ericaceae Station!"* Lena said, cheerfully, as the Zolodai ambassador lumbered onto the main concourse of the large trading station in orbit around Luna. 

The Zolodai lowered his shaggy-furred head so it was level with Lena's. She reached up and gently scratched the sort fur on the sides of the sloth-like Zolodai's head, and the alien in turn ran one of his long hooked claws delicately through her own braided locks. Ritualized mutual grooming was as fundamental to polite social interaction among the Zolodai as handshakes were for humans.

This greeting ritual accomplished, Lena gestured the ambassador forward and walked beside him as he made his way onto the concourse in his ponderous way. His people, she knew, were minimalists, when it came to verbal communication, so she spared her hirsute guest the usual spiel explaining the layout of the station, and allowed him to experience it for himself. 

They passed down a row of fragrant bayberry shrubs, which he sniffed at curiously, and rows of hydroponically grown holly bushes, which didn't seem to interest him. When they reached the long, narrow cranberry pond, he placed his broad, flat face close to the water and glanced at her. Lena, recalling a gesture she'd learned in xeno-diplomatic training, hooked her fingers to resemble the shape of a Zolodai's claws, and lifted them to her open mouth -- indicating that the ambassador was welcome to sample the berries.

Without further prompting, the large alien slurped up a hefty mouthful of the berries from the water, chewed thoughtfully, and then gave a slight head bob -- mild approval, Lena believed. They continued to the next row of bushes, which the ambassador sniffed, and then slowly passed a claw through, revealing them as holograms. 

Lena smiled. That usually got a response, as all of the other plants on the concourse were, well, *plants.* She readied herself for the next step. 

"Why?" the ambassador asked, speaking for the first time.

"These holograms," Lena explained. "Are of *Vaccinium membranaceum* -- which we call the black mountain huckleberry. We have no actual specimens on-station."

"Extinct?" the ambassador inquired.

She shook her head. "Oh no, it's very much extant. It's just that huckleberries have resisted all attempts at domestication and artificial cultivation, even on our homeworld -- artificially grown plants simply don't bear fruit, for reasons we still don't understand. We've set aside large swathes of wilderness as natural huckleberry cultivation preserves, and done everything we can to encourage their growth, but even so it's very difficult to keep up with demand for the fruit of these little shrubs."

The ambassador blinked. "Why demand?"

Lena had been waiting for this. She reached into her pocket, and withdrew a handful of dried huckleberries, offering them to the ambassador. The hulking alien delicately scooped them up in his claws, and then into his mouth.

The Zolodai's eyes went wide as he tasted the tiny fruit. Though Lena was trained not to read human emotional responses into those of aliens, she was sure the tears brimming in the ambassador's eyes were a positive sign.

"We...will trade for these." the Zolodai said, hoarsely.

Lena grinned. "I'm sure we can work something out."
