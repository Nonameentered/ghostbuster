"I hate fancy food." Tom protested, glumly, glowering across the table at his uncle, Weatherby.

The old man chortled, puffing out his thick gray mustache, and waving a hand in dismissal of his nephew's complaint. "Nonsense, Tom! You just need to refine that coarse American palette of yours."

As they were speaking, the waiter arrived, and placed a plate in front of each of them. 

“Ah! Merci, Garçon!” Weatherby said, beaming.

"May I get you anything else, monsieur?" the man asked, in heavily accented English. The waiter was tall and thin, with a thin moustache to match. Based on that alone, Tom was immediately suspicious of the server, and the restaurant in general. In his opinion, people who worked around *good* food should be fat and jolly, not slender and solicitous.

"That's all for now, though I await the next course with great anticipation." Weatherby said. The waiter gave a slight bow, and withdrew.

As Weatherby tucked into the dish with relish, Tom thought wistfully of the previous day's lunch, which they'd taken in London, at chip shop near his uncle's flat. It had been a meal of crispy battered cod and deliciously salty chips, with malt vinegar to taste, and he'd relished every greasy crumb. It was a fine start to his tour of Europe with his eccentric English uncle, he had thought. He *had* been excited to arrive in France early this morning, as well, but seeing what evidently passed for food in this country, he was now much less sanguine about the current leg of his journey.

"Eat up boy," Weatherby encouraged him. "It's a seasonal specialty in these parts -- *Salade Lyonnaise."*

Tom frowned down at the soft poached egg leaking semi-congealed yolk onto a nest of green leaves on his plate. He poked at them cautiously, furrowing his brow as the leaves crunched softly beneath his fork. "What kind of lettuce is this?"

Weatherby chuckled again. "It's not any kind of lettuce. Those are *dandelion* greens."

Tom blinked in surprise, then narrowed his eyes at the salad. "So...the 'seasonal specialty' is *weeds with an egg on top?"*

Tom's uncle rolled his eyes. "Just try it, boy!"

Tom sighed, taking a forkful of the salad. His eyes widened in surprise. The dandelion greens were slightly bitter, but the vinaigrette had a pleasant tanginess that perfectly complimented the richness of the egg yolk and the bits of crisp of smoky bacon garnishing the salad.

"Huh," Tom said, through a mouthful of greens. "This is actually pretty good. Maybe fancy food isn't so bad, after all."

Weatherby smiled. "There's a good lad. And the following course is just as delectable."

"Yeah? What's coming up next?" Tom asked.

"A classic French delicacy -- *escargot!"* Weatherby replied, enthusiastically.

Tom nodded, amiably. He had no idea what that was, but he'd already eaten *weeds and warm eggs,* and found it surprisingly palatable. How bad could it be?
