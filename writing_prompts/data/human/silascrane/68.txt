I should probably start at the beginning.

The year was 1972. I'd been living at the Royal Hawaiian Resort in Waikiki since it opened in the 1920s. I was a silent partner in the original construction project, and all I asked for in return for my contribution of capital, was a perpetual, transferable right to occupy one modest suite -- which I have, in fact, *perpetually* occupied ever since.

You must think I'm pretty ancient, and I guess I am -- I was in my fifties when the Resort opened, though I didn't look it. The thing is, though, I don't get old, and as far as I know I can't die -- at least not permanently. I found that out  back in 1985, when I was in a fatal car accident on the Likelike Highway. I don't remember much, fortunately, but apparently my car caught fire in the crash, and I ended up with 3rd or 4th degree burns over my entire body. I was basically a charred skeleton, by the time they got me out of the wreckage.

And then, the next day, I just woke up naked and unharmed on the beach. With a little checking, I found out I had "died", but then my body had gone missing from the morgue. I knew my return would raise all kinds of questions, so I made up a story about getting drunk with someone from out of town, and finding my car keys missing the next day, passing it off as a case of mistaken identity -- and since I never get cavities, there were no dental records to contradict me. The body going missing was weird, and the police investigated, but it wasn't like there was any chance of them figuring out what *really* happened.

And for what exactly *did* really happen: your guess is as good as mine. Did I just regenerate my flesh and streak out of the morgue, before passing out on the beach? Did Cthulhu teleport my bones to his undersea realm, patch me up, and then spit me out on land until the time comes for me to herald his apocalyptic return? Could be -- no clue. In well over a century of life, I've only learned one concrete fact about how this immortality of mine works -- but we'll get to that later.

So anyway, back to the 70s. I met Lena during the summer of '72 -- on the beach, naturally. At first glance, she was a typical tourist, with a cheesy lei around her neck, and an  umbrella drink in her hand. But she had a musical laugh, a beautiful smile, and she *loved* to dance.

To make a long story short, we hit it off, and she came back with me to my suite at the Royal Hawaiian, where she spent a considerable amount of the remaining two weeks of her vacation. After that, Lena had a normal life to go back to, and we parted ways amicably, no promises made and none broken.

This was a pattern I'd repeated with dozens of different young ladies visiting paradise, for dozens of hot Hawaiian summers, ever since I started living at the Royal Hawaiian. Now, I might have broken a heart or two, but never intentionally, nor carelessly. For my part, I was always honest and forthcoming about what I was -- and *wasn't --* offering the women I entertained in my beachside abode.

It's not a lifestyle I'd recommend to anyone who *doesn't* literally have eternity stretching out in front of them, but I'd more or less decided it was as close as *I* was gonna get to having a decent moral framework for my dalliances.

It had always seemed to me that monogamy would only be a recipe for ever-increasing grief, as I watched lover after lover wither away and die. Or worse, I might be wounded by their death so badly that I could *never* love again, and would be left eternally carrying a torch for someone forever out of my reach in the great beyond. If, on the other hand, I always bid my lovers farewell while we were both as young and vibrant as our passion for each other, I would never have to know that bone-deep sorrow and loss, and could still enjoy some, if not all of the comforts love has to offer.

At least that's what I tell myself when I'm feeling poetic. It's also possible that I just *really* like having sex.

Anyway, as you can imagine, I never expected to see Lena again -- or if I did, it would be years later, and she'd be older, maybe married with kids, or even attending her *own* kids' Hawaiian wedding.

But, as you've probably guessed, I did see her again.  It was 50 years later, at a touristy Luau I attended. (Events like that hold little appeal for me, personally, but I've learned it's a great place to find my "type", if you will.) I looked up from my plate of overcooked barbecue pork, and there she was.

She hadn't aged a *day.*

All kinds of thoughts raced through my head, at the sight-- was I seeing things? Could this be Lena's granddaughter, perhaps? But then our eyes locked, and I saw her look of recognition. This wasn't a relative, or some other sort of improbable dead ringer. It was *Lena.*

Slowly, we closed the distance to each other. When we were only a foot apart, we just stopped and stared. Lena broke the silence first.

"It's really you..." she said, a note of awe in her voice. "We finally found you."

My heart twisted. Had she been looking for me all this time? I'd never met anyone like me, before. It was amazing to think I could have had a two week fling with another immortal, and not even realized it. Then, I suddenly processed part of her statement I'd glossed over, and blinked.

*"We?"* I asked.

Three other women stepped up beside her, similar expressions on their faces. Two of those faces were vaguely familiar, but one I definitely recognized -- Angela, a woman I'd spent a week or two with in the early 2000s. She'd been 21 then, and she still looked it, now.

Right at that moment, it dawned on me.  And that was the day that I learned the fact I alluded to earlier, the *one thing* I know about how my particular brand of eternal life works:

Immortality, it turns out, is an *STD.*
