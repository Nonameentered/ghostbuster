Moments later, Dale found himself being hurriedly escorted out of his office by a phalanx of aliens. Thoughts streamed into his mind, as they marched him down the hallway, towards a gaping hole in the wall, through which he could see an alien craft suspended in midair.

"We are being invaded." the alien projected, in answer to his question.

"Ironic." Dale replied, in kind.

"I can see why you might think so, but allow me to elaborate. I am afraid this will be...uncomfortable."

Dale's knees buckled. On the horizon of his unconscious mind, he suddenly perceived it: the true Invader. An implacable being like a vast storm, rumbling hungrily beyond the edges of his mind -- no, of everyone's mind, he realized. This Invader, this entity that even the technologically advanced aliens feared, existed in and as thought, not matter, and it was encroaching on the collective unconscious of humanity, probing for weaknesses.

"We are relatively few in number, and most of our technology is useless, in the realm of pure thought. We cannot hold the Invader at bay forever." the alien explained. "It soon will break through our defenses and devour our minds,  making our bodies and all our works mere appendages of its will. Your species will be next."

"What the hell am I supposed to do about that?" Dale demanded, incredulously.

"Your species has the innate potential to act in the realm of thought, as we do. There are only a few hundred thousand of us, but there are billions of you. Your minds, unfortunately, are still underdeveloped. Your potential is, as of yet, asleep." the alien explained. "You, however, are a rare exception -- your species cannot hear us, but with our help, they will be able to hear you. You must deliver our message. You must awaken them."
