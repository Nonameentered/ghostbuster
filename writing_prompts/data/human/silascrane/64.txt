As he strode down the road towards the caves where the precious trilumine crystals could be mined from the cavern walls, the world suddenly went dark, and Jatinder froze.  

At first he thought he'd somehow been stricken blind, but then he realized that not only was his vision of the world gone, the sound, smells, and even the gentle breeze he'd felt on his skin had vanished. 

Abruptly his senses came rushing back. He smelled sweat and hot, stale air. His vision was still dark, but he could see thin, almost imperceptible slits of light. Hearing returned last, and he heard a persistent chirping sound -- along with an angry voice.

"Jatinder! Jatinder! *Madarchoad,* wake up!" the voice snarled.

Suddenly, someone seized his head, and Jatinder yelped, flailing his limbs. He struck something -- or someone -- and heard more cursing, before he felt something get violently yanked off his head. Light blinded him. 

When his eyes adjusted, he saw a middle aged man seated next to him, holding a strange helmet in his hands adorned with a blinking light that flashed red in time with the chirping sound, and was wearing equally strange clothing. He had a name tag that read "Ravi - Immersion Team Leader", and was glowering furiously at Jatinder.

"What the hell are you doing, idiot? You're supposed to be playing that merchant NPC on US Server D until 04:30! You can't just wander off -- you'll get us *both* in trouble! I swear, if you weren't my cousin--" 

"W-where am I?" Jatinder interrupted, looking around wildly. "What...what strange magic is this?"

The man's eyes widened in surprise, and then he groaned, sagging in his chair. "Don't tell me...you side-loaded an automated method-acting module into your headset's neural interface?! There is a *reason* those things aren't allowed, bloody stupid bastard!"
