"Not comin' down." Tom slurred. "M'loud ta be here." 

Captain Phaeton sighed, folding his arms, and staring at the forlorn middle-aged man dressed in a dirty blue jumpsuit, seated on the edge of the roof of the modest 20-story office complex. Tom wasn't trespassing, true. He had prior written permission from the owners of this building to be on their premises -- as he did for most of the buildings on the West Side. 

Most were happy to grant him that privilege: after all, the more familiar that Tom -- or, as he was known to the public, *The Restorer --* was with a building, the better he could use his strange power of four-dimensional translocation to restore it, should it be destroyed in one of the titanic clashes between superheroes and villains that often devastated the city. 

He was, it occurred to Phaeton, technically drunk in public, but the hero was far more concerned that the Restorer had *chosen* to seat himself precariously on the edge of a building while intoxicated. His power of Restoration only worked on inanimate objects, effectively re-assembling them, no matter how badly damaged, by copying their temporal state from a timeline where they were still intact in the present. It was all very complex, but the important thing, at least to the Captain, was that the Restorer was just as likely to die if he fell off the roof as anyone else was.

And based on the fact that the Restorer had just told friends he was quitting hero work after 25 years, it seemed like that might just be his intention. 

"I'm not going to force you to go anywhere." Captain Phaeton said gently. "I'm just here because I'm concerned about you." 

Tom laughed, bitterly. "Whyzat, Cap? Lotsa...lotsa over-glorified *janitors* in the city, righ'? Wha's one less matter?"

Phaeton winced. He should have known: there had been an article about Tom in the *Village Clarion,* the paper of choice for much of the city's elite upper crust. It hadn't been flattering. Phaeton himself had always dismissed it as an ivory-tower rag. To him, it was just another  self-important newsletter for the elite that was less objective and reliable than the tabloids it presumed to be so far above in integrity. 

But Tom was from an older generation, one that had looked up to the journalistic institutions that, in the present day, only looked down on people like him. Phaeton should have known the man would take it hard.

"Restorer..." Phaeton began, then lowered his voice, floating closer to the dejected hero. "Tom. Listen. Who cares what they say? The people who matter, the friends you work with, we respect and value you. Me, Phantom, Justicia--"

"'Sticia!" Tom snapped, looking up and glaring at Phaeton with bleary eyes. "Yeah she...she really came to my defense, huh?"

"Tom..." Captain Phaeton sighed, but Restorer cut him off again.

"Mishojenny runsh deep in the City's so-called heroes!" Tom barked, holding up his hands in proclamation, as he quoted the Village Clarion's hit piece. *"Over-glor'fied janitor* shows how backwards and oppressive the supers really are! Read all 'bout it!"

"It was a hatchet job, Tom, and everyone knows it." Captain Phaeton said, holding up his hands placatingly.

"Yeah, everbuddy knowsh." Tom snapped. "How come 'everbuddy' didn't tell the lady buildin' superintendent here? She knowsh I got p'mission ta be here. Curshed me out an' slammed the door in my face anyhow. Had ta come up the fire escape."

"Tom..." Phaeton pleaded.

"They shed I shed wemman shoon't be superheroesh!" Tom spat, pausing to take another swig from his concealed bottle. "Never shed that! Never shed nuffing like that. I shed, 'There weren't so many wemman heroesh whens I was a kid', cause they asked. I didden mean nuffing by it. Same thing with what I says about 'Sticia -- an we been frens f'ever, me an her. I thought we was, anyways. So I shed to them, 'I know her, she's strong, and shmart, and she's real nysh lookin' too.' But they only quoted the lasht part, cept they made it sound sleazy. An thash all they needs...all they needs ta ruin yer life."

"Tom, we all get this kind of thing. Don't take it so seriously -- these people aren't journalists, they're demagogues and provocateurs." Captain Phaeton said, crossing his arms. "I get flak from them all the time, too! But so what if some journalist says I'm an 'interplanetary colonialist' or that I got my powers by 'falling into a vat of radioactive toxic masculinity'? It's annoying, but it's not really *that* bad. I mean, I don't like it, but it's not like bad press is the worst hazard of being a hero, right? We can take it."

"You can take it." Tom said, softly. "Mishter *page one."*

"Page one?" Captain Phaeton asked, cocking an eyebrow.

"What you do for the city," he explained, somewhat more soberly. "It's on page one of the papers, all the time. You can let 'em hit ya, cause they can't knock *you* down. Me? I'm page four -- maybe three, onna really good day. An thas' okay. I never was in it for the fame. But you know what? *This* was my first page one. My 15 minutes a' fame. All ta' tell the world what a no-good bum I am."

"Tom..." the Captain said softly. "I...didn't...."

"I'm not gon' off myself, Cap." Tom said, abruptly. He stared down at the ground. "That's why yer here, right? Thought I might do somethin' stupid?"

"I was worried about you, yes." he admitted.

"Well don' be. I'll be alright. And...I ain't really gonna quit, either. I know...I know what I do is important. Savin' peoples' homes, livelihoods...I'll...I'll be back at work tomorrow. Just like always." the man sighed, looking older and more tired than Captain Phaeton had ever seen him.

Phaeton didn't say any more. He just floated to the edge of the roof, and then sat beside the weary old hero in companionable silence, until Tom was ready to head back down.
