Her lips on mine were sweet and fever-hot as she clung to me, urging me towards her bedroom door. It had happened so fast -- faster than I would have thought possible. Faster than I thought I wanted, to be honest. We'd only just met, but I felt such a deep connection to Emily that that didn't seem to matter -- especially not in the face of the most overpowering physical attraction I'd ever felt for another human being.

And then, as passion overcame me and I swept her up in my arms to carry her the last few steps to her bed, I felt a presence in the room. Strange, and yet also familiar. My head snapped up just in time to see the tail end of a large, spectral segmented body skitter out of sight into her bedroom closet.

Her eyes followed mine, and then she giggled, craning her neck to kiss me again.

"It's okay..." she whispered, her voice husky and urgent, during the brief moments her lips left my skin.  "That's just Leggy...I told her...she can trust you, and she said she likes you. She won't disturb us..."

I groaned inwardly. I instantly knew what was happening. But I wanted *so badly* to pretend I didn't.

With a supreme effort, I set Emily down, and then, gritting my teeth, I took a single step back from her.

"Buzz!" I snarled. "Get out here, you little bastard!"

Emily looked around in confusion for a moment, but then she lost interest and reached out to me, trying to renew our embrace. I gently caught her hand and held her at bay -- she clearly hadn't realized yet. It wouldn't be right.

"I know you're there, Buzz," I hissed, looking around angrily. "If you don't--"

"H-hey Justin!" Buzz said, nervously, as the spirit of the ancient *meganeura* manifested in the room. He looked like a ghostly, faintly luminous dragonfly, with the wingspan of a large bird. He was -- ostensibly -- my animal spirit guide, who'd been with me since childhood

"Sorry, it, um, took me a second to get here -- I thought you told me to make myself scarce tonight? 'Cause of your date and all?"

Emily gaped at Buzz -- clearly, as I'd suspected, she could see spirits, too -- and I watched the realization dawn in her eyes, the languid warmth in them replaced by the heat of outrage.

"Leggy!" she practically screamed.

The ghost of the gigantic centipede skittered out of her closet, and reared up next to her. "Hey baby girl, what's up?" it said in a cheerful, almost maternal voice.

"Don't 'baby girl' me right now, Leggy!" Emily snapped, crossing her arms. She gestured to me and Buzz. "What the hell is *this?"*

"Hey!" Buzz said, with unconvincing surprise. "Look at that. *She's* a shaman with an ancient spirit guide from the carboniferous period, too. Small world, huh, J-dog?"

"You two set this up!" I accused.

"Whaaaaaaat?" Leggy said, innocently, touching her legs to her thorax, as though scandalized by the very suggestion.

Emily looked horrified, and a little hurt. "Have you been...been abusing your powers to make me *horny,* Leggy?"

Buzz interrupted. "Whoa, whoa, it's not like that!"

Leggy nodded, vigorously. "We only *amplified* what was already there, honey bear! Ya'll kids got some *real* chemistry!"

I grimaced as Leggy coiled loosely around me and gestured to me with her many legs, as though she was displaying me like a prize on a game show. "I mean, *look* at this guy! You can't tell me you weren't finna get you some of *that."* With my previous spirit-stoked ardor gone, my natural first-date shyness had returned, and I felt my cheeks flush hotly.

Buzz buzzed over by Emily, who looked as flustered as I felt. The spirit indicated her with his own legs. "And look at *her,* J-man! She's stunning, she's smart -- *you* sure as hell ain't gonna do better."

"But why?" I demanded. "Why did you do this?"

Leggy sighed. "Honey...there's..." She trailed off, awkwardly.

"There are fewer and fewer natural shamans being born, every year." Buzz said, sadly.

Leggy nodded, skittering back over to Emily, and said in a small voice. "So many of us are out in the cold already, with no free shamans to bond with. What happens when...when you pass on, if no one replaces you?"

"What if we're all just forgotten?" Buzz asked, somberly. "We don't 'go into the light' like you humans: we're *spirits of the land,* man.  We're bound to this world forever. We've...we've got nowhere else to go."

"Aw, Leggy..." Emily said, her expression softening for a moment. Then she paused, narrowing her eyes. "Wait a minute. So, when you told me I didn't need my birth control pills anymore because your spirit magic would stop me from getting pregnant..?"

"Yeah naw, you're like *super fertile* right now, girl." Leggy admitted.

"You bitch!" Emily cried.

"Come on!" Buzz whined. "Just make us *one* shaman baby!"

"Uh, excuse me? I helped set this up, too!" Leggy interjected. "They need to make at least *two* shaman babies!"

"Right, right. Two shaman babies." Buzz amended.

"No!" I snarled.

"Why? Come on, man -- when I was alive, I fertilized *dozens* of eggs! It's easy!" He gestured to Emily with his spindly legs. "Just put a baby in there."

"Two babies, if you can. Better to get 'em both done at once -- my girl's got classes and shit." Leggy added.

"No one's putting a baby in here!" Emily shouted, placing her hands over her abdomen, as though trying to shield her uterus from invading offspring.

"Especially not me!" I snapped. "I'm not ready to be a father!"

Buzz snorted derisively. "You seemed pretty 'ready' a minute ago..."

"And you were practically *throwing* your ovipositor at him." Leggy added to Emily, accusingly.

"Leggy, gross!" Emily protested. "And I don't even *have* one of those!"

The centipede threw up a dozen of her limbs in consternation. "Whatever! Tomato, vagina, it's the same shit. Just bang him already!"

I turned to Emily, determinedly ignoring the continued chattering of our spirit guides. "I had a good time, but this..."

"...this isn't how this should happen." Emily finished, likewise disregarding the spectral crosstalk and addressing only me.

"So I'm...I'm gonna go." I said, jerking a thumb over my shoulder towards the door.

She just nodded back at me.

As I turned to leave, Emily added. "But...maybe we could just...hang out again, sometime? I mean, I've never met someone else with an *asshole spirit guide,* before."

I turned back as I reached the door, and smiled at her. "I'd like that."

Once I left Emily's apartment, Buzz manifested at my side again.

"Don't EVER do that again!" I growled, without turning to face him. "I mean it!"

"Yeah, yeah. I promise I'll never, ever heighten your emotional and physical attraction to a female shaman again, okay?" Buzz agreed, drily.

Then the dragonfly spirit added, with a note of smug satisfaction, "Besides, I have a feeling I won't *have to."*

"Shut up." I grumbled.
