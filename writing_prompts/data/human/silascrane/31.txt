I live in a mobile home. A *very* mobile home. 

It's about the size of a garden shed, but that's to be expected, since it's only a few months old. It...well, it isn't exactly what I would have chosen for myself, but I kinda have to love it anyway. For one thing, it was a gift from my Grandma for graduation. I'm the first person in my whole extended family to get a college degree, and Grams was really proud -- she got all emotional when she saw me in the cap and gown, and everything.

And besides, I have to admit it's pretty cool, as "tiny homes" go. It's got a little combined toilet / shower stall thing, a bunch of  convenient compact appliances, fold-away furniture, a little loft platform where my bed is, and this funny way of waddling around on its awkward little chicken legs. 

That last part probably needs some background information, doesn't it?

My name's Alex Vedma, and as you may or may not have guessed, "Grams" is better known to the world by another name -- *Baba Yaga.* Now, a lot of stories make her out to be this murderous old fairy / witch figure from the darkest corners of Slavic mythology, but the truth is...well, actually that *is* more or less the truth. She's pretty bad. But she does love *me,* and she's my grandma, so I love her too. You ever watch that one mafia show, *The Sopranos?* I guess being part of my family's kind of like being part of *that* family. 

But anyway, back to the house. It's the son of Grams' house. Or maybe the daughter of her house? I don't know. I really don't want to think about whether my house has a dick or not, right now. The point is, like Baba Yaga's legendary house from all the stories, *my* house can stand up on two little chicken-like legs, and walk.

And it does walk. It actually follows me around.

And it *will not stop* following me around.

This is a major problem, because unlike a lot of less-fortunate recent graduates, I have a *job.* Of course, I tried tying my house to a tree, but as soon as I got too far away for its comfort, it snapped the rope like a thread and waddled after me. I thought about trying a chain or something, but I think it might just break that, too, or else hurt itself trying to pull it loose.

It's acting like a needy puppy, except if I had some tiny pupper-doggo that couldn't bear to leave my side, I could probably get away with bringing it to work for a while. If, on the other hand, my house were to smash through the wall of my company's office building like Kool-Aid Man, I feel like my boss would probably be less than understanding about it. He'd probably fire me, and then Grams would probably *eat him,* and it'd be a whole damn thing.

So, I decided I needed to bring out the big guns: I called my Uncle Red. He's in the stories too, so he knows a lot about this kind of weird Slavic magic fairy folklore crap. He showed up at my house around noon, because that's more or less the only time he shows up anywhere, which is a whole other story. He didn't even get out of his car -- a Dodge challenger that, like everything my uncle owns, is red. He just rolled down the window, and stared at me from behind red-rimmed sunglasses. Not a man for small talk, is my Uncle Red, so I got right to the point.

"The house won't stop following me."

Uncle Red stared at me.

"Like, everywhere I go, my house goes."

Uncle Red stared at me. 

"How do I make it stop doing that?"

Uncle Red stared at me. And then, finally, he spoke.

"Tell it to *stay."* 

Before I could reply, the tinted window of the red Challenger rolled up, and he sped away. 

Of course, I'd already done that. Maybe I hadn't been firm enough? Did it only speak Russian? I'd never learned my ancestral language. I guess I should have, but Spanish just seemed so much more useful, back when I was choosing electives. As I began to pace back and forth, pondering my predicament, I heard a loud crunching sound behind me.

The house was *pacing with me.* 

It was, I realized, going to be a long-ass day.
