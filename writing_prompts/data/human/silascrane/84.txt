Tanar Jann-Sun approached the ancient structure, half-embedded in the rock beneath Starfall Mountain. Raising his torch, he saw it, as the Tome had described, a flat diamond-shaped pane of flawless crystal, embedded in the metal, flush with its surface. 

The Eye of the Leviathan. 

He shrank bank in alarm, as the Eye began to glow with unsettling red light. But this, too, had been alluded to in the tome. The Leviathan of the buried labyrinth would slay those who lingered too long beneath its burning gaze, *unless* that gaze was met by the gaze of the mythic warrior who had mastered the beast, back in time immemorial.

He raised the crystal reliquary, passed down in his family for generations. Inside, immured in an alchemical tincture that prevented its decomposition, there floated an *eye,* so clear and crystal blue that it seemed almost alive. An eye much like Tanar's own, for it belonged to the legendary warrior who had been his distant ancestor. 

A ray of red light shone from the Leviathan's eye, and swept over the reliquary. Then the light of the beast's eye turned from red to green, and Tanar looked around in alarm, as a voice spoke to him in an unknown language, seemingly from out of nowhere.

He reached into his belt pouch, and withdrew a small scroll that he'd paid to have prepared for him by a hedge-wizard before beginning his journey. He read the words of power written on it, and felt a tingling surge of power, as the spell the wizard pre-cast into the roll of specially prepared parchment took effect. At the same time, it's power expended, the scroll crumbled to dust in his hand. Now, until the next dawn, he would be able to speak, read, and understand any language, no matter how ancient or esoteric. 

"...Leviathan?" Tanar said, hesitantly. "Did you speak to me?"

He jumped, involuntarily, as part of the stone wall suddenly crumbled, as a metal panel like a drawbridge broke free of a thin coating of stone. Beyond it, he saw what looked like a darkened cooridor. Was it...the *inside* of the Leviathan?

"Yes, I  did. I said 'Welcome back; Ship exiting standby mode.'" the Leviathan said, its words now intelligible to him, thanks to the power of the spell scroll. At the same time, the cooridor filled with light, though there were no lamps, torches, or braziers to be seen within. Instead, panels along the ceiling glowed with bright light, though they gave off no heat that he could feel. It was not unlike the magelights that adorned the hedge-wizard's hut, though these panels had a steady white glow similar to daylight, instead of the unearthly blue of the wizard's magical sconces.

"Please step inside so that I may reseal the hatchway, Acting-Captain Janssen. Since you have disabled my short-range and internal sensors -- apart from the security retinal scanner -- I cannot guarantee the integrity of the ship against any potential airborne pathogens, if you continue allowing the air to mingle with the outside atmosphere." The Leviathan said. 

He stepped cautiously into the corridor. He felt uneasy, as the strange drawbridge closed behind him, but he shoved the feeling down, trusting in the unblinking gaze of his long-dead forebear to tame the creature. Nearby, another set of doors opened, labeled "Bridge" and he slowly approached them.

"Stand upon the bridge at the heart of the Leviathan, where the living may seek counsel with the dead..." he muttered, remembering a line from the Tome that had brought him to Starfall Mountain, the labyrinth, and the Leviathan at its center.

"Captain Janssen..." The Leviathan said, as Tanar stepping into the chamber, looking around in awe. It didn't look like any sort of bridge the young man had ever seen. "Based on my internal chronometer, you have been absent for approximately 427 years. As gathering data about anomalous events encountered during our voyage is among my primary functions, perhaps you could provide an explanation of the rather large discrepancy between your current estimated age of 458,  and the projected upper limits of human longevity, both with and without medical intervention?"

Tanar blinked, trying to put together the meaning -- he understood the words, but the ideas expressed were strange. Finally, it dawned on him: the beast thought he was his ancestor! Best, he decided, not to disabuse it of that notion. Instead, he pulled another scroll from his pouch -- this one was non-magical, simply a roll of parchment on which he'd written notes from the tome. 

In the event the Leviathan became unsettled, he was supposed to put it into a temporary trance by saying "Leviathan, perform base-level self-diagnostic -- yes, yes, accept, begin now."

The Leviathan sounded as though it was going to interrupt him, but each word after 'diagnostic' seemed to cause the beast to start a new sentence, which he in turn interrupted with the next word of the strange spell from the tome. It was like his ancestor, or whoever had written the tome, had *known* what the Leviathan would say, and how to respond to it. Finally, after he said the final "begin now", the Leviathan was silent.

"Leviathan?" he asked, cautiously.

There was no response, and Tanar nodded, breathing a sigh of relief. Good. It was asleep. 

And then, a spirit appeared.

Tanar drew his sword and stepped back, eye widened. He knew what the Tome had said about seeking counsel with the dead, but he had expected a library, or some other record left by his forebears. Instead, a man stood before him, suspended in mid-air, his body slightly hazy and transparent. It's voice, however, far from being ghostly or sepulchral, was crystal clear.

"Hello. My name is Lieutenant Erik Janssen, acting Captain of the UWSS Leviathan." the ghost said.
