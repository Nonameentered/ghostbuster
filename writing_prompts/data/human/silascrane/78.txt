II:

I opened my eyes, and blinked them into focus. I was sitting on the floor with my back against the wall, in a drab, dimly lit corridor. It made me think of an old government building -- stark, utilitarian, and lifeless. 

As my vision cleared, the memory of my last few moments of consciousness snapped into focus, as well. I scrambled to my feet. Apparently, whatever drug that creepy old couple had used on me hadn't left me with a hangover, as I felt no pain or dizziness as I stood.

"Hi." a timid voice called, from behind me. I whirled around in alarm.

Sophia peeked at me from around a corner, cringing back slightly as I spun on her. She looked tired, but unharmed. Her blue dress had been replaced by a baggy gray shirt and pants, similar to hospital scrubs, along with gray fabric slippers. I glanced down at myself, and realized I was dressed the same.

"Sophia!" I demanded "Where are we? What did your parents do to me?"

She hung her head again. "They aren't my parents. And we're...we're *nowhere.*"

"What do you mean nowhere?" I snapped, and she cringed again. I winced, instantly feeling like an asshole. I sighed, collecting myself, and walked towards her, slowly this time, so as not to startle her. Whatever had happened, it clearly wasn't this little girl's doing. I held out my hands in a conciliatory gesture.

"I'm sorry, Sophia. I know this isn't your fault. But I don't understand. What do you mean we're nowhere?"

She shook her head. "I...don't really understand it either. It's like...like a bad dream." She looked up at me, somberly. "Except we don't get to wake up." Then she brightened, slightly. "Max could tell you more. He's been here forever."

Ideas swirled in my head. Sophia was here with me, and now this Max. What was this, some kind of black site prison? But what had I ever done to get on the radar of some shadowy alphabet soup organization? As I pondered this, Sophia timidly offered me her small, pale hand. I smiled, and took it, trying to look reassuring, even though I had even less idea what was going than she did.

She led me down the hallway. I paused by one of the doors. I thought I saw movement through the small, rectangular window of tinted glass, and I reached for the handle. 

"No!" Sophia cried, tugging on my hand, urgently. "Don't open the doors!"

I frowned. "Why not?"

"There are bad things on the other side. " she said, looking fearfully from me to the doors. Then she relaxed, slightly.  "But they're locked, anyway...most of the time."

Deciding I'd wait to delve into this mystery until we met up with this 'Max' person, I just nodded, and let Sophia continue leading me along. After a few turns, walking through what seemed to be identical hallways, we reached a hallway with a large opening in one side. 

Beyond the opening, there was what looked like a break room, its decor like something out of the 1980s. There were rows of tables and chairs, a coffee machine, and even a snack vending machine, although the latter had a yellowed sign stuck to it, with  "Out of Order" scrawled on it in faded marker. The only other adornment was "Room 36", painted on the walls in stark block letters.

At one of the tables, a gray-bearded old man sat by himself, huddled around a small styrofoam cup of coffee. He was dressed like Sophia and I, though he also had a small gray skull cap atop his head.

As we approached him, he raised his head, curiously. His face fell when he saw me. 

"Hello," he said, his expression gradually turning into a wry, suffering smile, as he added. "I'm very sorry to see you."
