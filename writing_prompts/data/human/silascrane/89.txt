Lady Jennifer held out her cupped hands to Sir Richard, beaming. She showed him an oblong, apple-sized object that looked like the husk of a nut or seed.

"What is it, my love?" he asked, curiously.

"This is it, beloved! An *elderfly cocoon!"*

Richard's face lit up. The cocoon had been the object of their quest. It was the one thing that could break the curse. 

They both started, suddenly. A ragged, bird-sized butterfly had appeared above them, out of thin air. It fluttered down unsteadily, and landed on Jennifer's palm by the cocoon. As they watched, frozen in amazement, it wriggled into the chrysalis, and then sealed itself up.

Jennifer looked up at him, uncertainly. "What does it mean?"

Before Richard could answer, the cocoon began to crack open again.

Richard groaned in pain, as the tank spat him out onto the floor amid a tidal wave of synthetic amniotic fluid.  A robotic voice crackled in his ears.

*SimuLand terminated. Neo-gestation cycle complete.*

Memories began to surface: Playing roleplaying games with Jennifer as a child, he a brave knight, she a clever sorceress. Her cheering him on at the swim meet that won him his scholarship. Presenting his doctorate thesis on mass-rejuvenation of cells in the human body by inducing them to revert to a pre-natal state, and begin growing again. Jennifer, creating SimuLand to keep memory and consciousness intact as brain neurons reverted to embryonic stem cells, and then back again. Both of them, growing old...and then deciding to gamble their last few years of life together on a daring experiment.

He opened his eyes. On the floor across from him, Jennifer lay motionless in her own puddle of fluid, at the foot of her empty tank. 

Then she opened her eyes, and smiled at him.
