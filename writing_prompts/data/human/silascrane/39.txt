I:

There really was no choice, Darren thought, as he walked towards the NMH rig dangling from the ceiling, two android guards behind him. The planet needed this. The leaders of the world had decided, and most people had agreed. As the android gently but implacably lifted him off his feet and into the harness, he tried to console himself.

*It's paradise. Heaven. Eternal life, without pain or suffering.*

That was the sales pitch for the Docker, the 5' spherical shell containing the quantum-computer powered simulated universe that would, soon, would replace Earth as mankind's homeworld.

No more, said its architects, would mankind be a plague on the planet of their birth. Their mortal shells discarded, the neurally mapped citizens of the Docker could instead live forever without want or hardship in a perfect universe, without harming their ravaged homeworld any further.

Darren had just turned 25, and as a lower-middle manager, he'd never dreamed he could enjoy such an early and leisurely retirement as what had been promised. But this was still cold comfort to him, for a few reasons. One was that his survival, and that of his entire, his entire species was now utterly dependent on one little ball of metal. This, he had to admit, was perhaps not a very rational fear.

The underground facility that maintained this electronic Eden could be cleanly powered virtually forever by the deep geothermal plants beneath it, and its systems could be maintained for just as long. There were enough stockpiled components and raw materials for the robots in charge of the facility to rebuild it a thousand times over, if necessary, though even the most fragile and consumable of its parts would last for eons.

While it was thought of as a singular unit, humanity's tiny new planet within a planet, even the Docker sphere itself was full of redundancies. It actually contained 24 much smaller spheres, the quantum-scale microcircuitry of each one capable of housing all of the neurally mapped human minds and their simulated universe all by itself. The odds of any one of them failing was astronomical to begin with, but even if one did, another sphere would immediately engage. The occupants would never even notice thier "universe" had collapsed. Even then, the robots in the facility would also replace the faulty sphere, so no level of redundancy would be permanently lost. It was perfect.

So, perhaps Darren could reassure himself, as far as the safety of the Docker was concerned. After all, when compared to the scale of the universe, or even just our own galaxy, what was the Earth itself, except a *slightly* less little ball?

But as the attending androids lowered the neural-link helmet onto his head, there was one fear he couldn't so easily dismiss, for it was far too ancient and primal a terror: he was afraid to die. No matter how the proponents of the Docker tried to spin it, the fact was that he was not being "put in" into the Docker. No, a *computer model* of his mind was being put into the Docker, and in the process, his "redundant" body would "deactivated".

So, a *model* of Darren's mind would live on, if the simulated interactions of digital neural maps inside the Docker could be called living. But Darren himself was about to die.  Once the android finished connecting him, the NMH rig hoisted him off his feet, as it and millions of other rigs connected to the Docker facility had done with billions of humans before, both willingly and unwillingly.

As one of the last, or for all he knew, *the very* last human to be collected, he had the "honor" of being mapped just a few yards away from the Docker itself. He could see it, his ostensible new home, aglow with gleaming diodes, as a tingling sensation crawled over his scalp, indicating that the mapping process had begun. He closed his eyes, and waited for the end to come. Death felt like a slow descent.

And then, his feet touched the floor.
