"The murderer of Deela DuVenture," Detective Robideaux announced, "Is none other than *Ariana Blau!"*

A chorus of startled exclamations rippled through the common room of the Seaside Inn, where the diminutive investigator had gathered the interested parties. All eyes turned to the glass-sided aquari-carriage that had been wheeled into the common room to allow the young marmid performer to attend the gathering of otherwise air-breathing persons of interest.

Ariana placed a slender hand to her mouth and tittered silently, before swimming up to the coral-encrusted microphone in her little tank, and pressing the button on its side so she could be heard outside her carriage.

"Really, detective? *I* killed Deela? Do remind us, how far from the nearest water was that little cottage where poor Deela was found?" Ariana asked, tapping a finger on her lower lip in mock thoughtfulness. 

Detective Robideaux smiled thinly, stroking his long, pointed white beard. "Ah! A salient point, Ms. Blau. Do refresh our memories, Inspector Eversong?"

The young -- or at least, young-appearing -- elvish constable consulted his notebook. "Ms. DuVenture's country cottage, where her body was found, is just over 2 kilometers from the nearest body of water, Detective."

 "Ah! Such a long way!" the little gnomish investigator cried, with feigned distress. "Perhaps I am wrong, after all? Ah, but wait, can you not hold your breath, Ms. Blau? You, after all, are a *legendary* singer. You are surely adept at making the most of the water in your gills, yes?"

The marmid smirked, lifting her chin proudly. "Of course! I can easily hold my breath for five minutes -- perhaps as many as seven, if I'm well prepared. But long enough to crawl *two kilometers* over land on my fins? Hardly!"

"Alas!" Robideaux said. Then, the little gnome snapped his fingers.  "Ah! But did we not earlier establish that the Northbound Express passes through the village of Carmarthen, at a little depot right next to where Ms. Duventure's cottage is located? Indeed, it made its usual half-hour stop there on the very night she was murdered. Perhaps Ms. Blau simply traveled on the train?"

"Detective," Inspector Eversong interrupted, "I must point out that while marmids do make use of rail services from time to time, they only do so by special engagement of aquari-carriage cars, which aren't otherwise in regular service. The Northbound Express was pulling no such car on the day of the murder, nor has it done so for a few weeks. Where could she possibly have ridden on the train?"

"Indeed." Ariana said, cooly. "Care to explain that, detective?"

"Oh my." Robideaux said, pacing back and forth. "That *is* a question, isn't it? My my my....how *could* a marmid ride a train without an aquari-carriage. And unnoticed, at that!"

"As you say." Ariana said, with a smirk. "It's impossible."

Robideaux continued, as though he hadn't heard her. "How could a marmid ride unseen on a train." The little gnome slowly turned towards her, a smile spreading across his face. "On a *steam train."*

Ariana's scowled, uncertainly. "What...what do you mean?"

"Though I am not an engineer, unlike many of my folk," Robideaux continued, crisply. "I am acquainted with the functioning of steam contraptions, including locomotives. I know, at least, that a steam locomotive like the Northbound Express does not merely require coal to run....it also requires *water."* 

Robideaux raised a finger in the air. "Which is why, at every depot along the line -- including the the harbor depot mere blocks away from this very room, where cargo is transfered from ships at anchor to the railway -- there is a *water tower! "*

Ariana's eyes widened.

Robideaux grinned. "In order to facilitate the quick transfer of water between the water tower and the train's water tank, the apertures of both are extremely wide -- easily wide enough for a slender marmid lady such as yourself to pass through when the tanks and tower are opened!"

The marmid glared down at the gnomish detective. "You...you have no proof! This is nothing but a pile of suppositions, a wild narrative designed to fit your inane theory that I killed Deela!"

"Oh, I don't know if I have *no* proof," Robideaux said casually. "For example, normally, a wire grate covers the outflow aperture of the water tower, so that if by chance some debris or sediment were to end up in the tower, it won't be transferred to the train. And yet, when I had some harbor workers examine the tower today, I was informed that this important grate had been removed from the aperture entirely."

"So?" she sneered. "Some...some *shoddy maintenance* at the harbor? That proves nothing."

"Of course not." Robideaux agreed. "And you knew very well that this small fact could not incriminate you, which is why you never even bothered to replace the grate when you returned to Seaside. But I wonder, Ms. Blau...did you know that, within the pipes leading from the train's water tank to the boiler, there is *another* filter? That's gnomish engineering for you -- always another redundancy, yes?"

"Are you *ever* going to come to any kind of point, detective, or are you just going to spend all day making unfounded accusation?" the marmid growled.

"Oh I am coming to the point, Ms. Blau, I assure you." the gnome replied, evenly. "Earlier today, I visited the trainyard, and obtained the assistance of the Northbound Express' engineer in removing and inspecting the water filter I just mentioned. And caught within the fine copper mesh of that filtration device...I discovered *this."*

Another stunned susurrus rolled over the crowd, as Robideaux held up a tiny, gleaming metallic object. To many, it might have looked like an inconsequential bit of metal, or an odd-shaped coin. But by the look of horror on her face, Ariana Blau clearly saw it for what it was, as did many of those assembled in the common room: 

It was a tiny, recently shed *marmid scale.*
