"You can't...you can't take my kids, Donny!" Della slurred, glaring at her older brother.

Donald snarled at her incoherently, and she replied with a derisive snort.

"L-look atchew! You say I got problems, but y-you can't even talk right." Della sneered. "What the hell're you even saying?"

"He *said* ye're nae going tae take those boys, Della." a hard voice said from behind her. "Donald may have a wee speech impediment, aye, but it's nae *him* who's the problem, here."

Turning around, her eyes widened as she saw her uncle, Scrooge McDuck striding down the dock, two dour looking vultures at his back, whom she recognized as members of the old mans high-priced legal team.

"U-uncle Scrooge!" she cried. "You...you can't be taking his side! They're *my* children!"

"They may be your blood, but ye're nae *mother.* I saw the bruises on Huey, girl!" Scrooge spat, shaking his cane at his niece. "Aye, and the black eye ye gave tae wee Dewey, when the lad tried tae help his brother."

"I told you," she protested. "They got hurt when--"

"Nae more lies!" He snapped, angrily. "I had me own doctor take a look at the lads -- it wasnae any damned *bicycle accident!*"

Donald, having regained control of his speech impediment, said, a hint of compassion audible under his anger, "You need help, Della. And the boys need to be safe."

Tears filled her eyes. "You can't do this."

"I think you'll find we can, ma'am." One of the vultures said. "Between the doctor's report and your brother's testimony, Mr. McDuck has all the evidence he needs. If this information were to find its way to the Duckburg District Attorney..."

The lawyer trailed off, as Scrooge broke in. "Let's make it simple: There's a Rehab facility near Cape Suzette, the best money can buy. The bloody place is damn near a *resort,* if ye ask me. Ye're going tae go there and ye arenae gonnae leave or try tae contact the boys until the doctors there tell me ye're free o' the drugs -- aye, and o' the drink, as well."

"And...and if I say no?" she challenged, lifting her bill defiantly, though her voice was beginning to waver.

Scrooge McDuck narrowed his eyes. He drew himself up to his full height, and stepped up to Della, his beak inches from hers. "Then me lawyers there send those files tae the DA, the boys get taken away from ye anyway, and ye can rot in jail and *be damned."* 

Della looked liked she'd been slapped. She opened her bill to respond, but then sagged in defeat, hanging her head.

"I never meant to hurt them." she whispered to the ground, hoarsely.

"Mr. McDuck has a car waiting for you, Ms. Duck." one of the lawyers said, calmly, gesturing for her to follow him. Scrooge lingered behind, as his attorneys led Della away.

"Are ye going to be okay, lad?" Scrooge asked.

Donald bowed his head. "I'll be okay. I'll...think of something to tell the boys."

Scrooge placed a hand on his nephew's shoulder. "If ye need anything, or if the lads do..."

Donald nodded, and Scrooge turned away, following his attorneys out. Donald went back inside, where he found the boys, still waiting up for him.

It broke his heart to see them, with  their little eyes wide, scared, and full of tears. He didn't know what to do. So he did what he always did, when his nephews were sad, or scared.

He told them a story.

He told them how their mother, Della, had gone off on an incredible adventure. She loved them, Donald explained, and that was why she'd had to leave them for a while, because the place she was in was just too dangerous for three little boys. She might have gotten lost at some point on her journey, he added, but he assured them that she'd find her way back.

When they asked why she'd gotten mad and hurt Huey, he hadn't known how to explain. So, he told them that wasn't really their mom who'd done that, it was just someone who looked like her. Louie piped up, asking if it had been some kind of witch, casting a spell to look their mother. Donald, smiling at his nephew's imagination, and said it was something like that, but then Dewey blindsided by asking him the witch's name.

In the moment, the best he could come up with, stammering through his response, had been:

 "Magic....uh...the...spell...er, *Magica DeSpell!"*

To Donald's relief, the boys had accepted this with solemn nods, vowing to keep an eye out for this wicked witch in the future. Huey, however, was scared the witch might come get him in the night, while everyone was asleep. Desperately, Donald fished in his shirt pocket, looking for something he could pass off as some kind of protective magic talisman.

He found that all he had at the moment was a dime, so he told Huey it was his great uncle Scrooge's *lucky dime,* and that if it was lucky enough to make Scrooge McDuck a billionaire, it would be surely be lucky enough to foil the witch's evil magic. This too, the kids accepted, and finally, he got them calmed down and put to bed.

Looking out the window of the houseboat where he lived with the boys, he thought of his years as a seaman, sometimes sailing through stormy weather.

No life-threatening squall on the open sea had ever been as hard as trying to be a father to his three precocious nephews. Out on the ocean, there might be the odd storm, sure. But here, in Duckburg?

Life was like a *hurricane.*
