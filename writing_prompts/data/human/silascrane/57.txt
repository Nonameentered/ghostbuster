Fin bellied up to the spectral bar with a weary groan, next to a glum-looking dark-skinned ghost wearing spectacles.

"Phineas." the spectacled man said, in a minimal greeting.

"Louis." Fin replied, with a nod.

The ghostly bartender, a slender Irishman with a ready smile, approached the somber pair.

"Evenin' gents." the cheerful barman greeted them, as he loudly crunched something between his teeth.

"Good evening, Michael." Louis mumbled, before letting out a heavy sigh of his own.

"Mike." Fin said. Then he frowned. "The hell you chawin' on? Sunflower seeds?"

Mike laughed. "Nah." He held out a can full of small, sharp objects. "Carpet tacks! Want some?"

Fin grimaced. "Hell no! Why in tarnation are *you* eating 'em?"

Mike shrugged. "Guess I developed a taste for 'em when I was alive. You know, putting carpet tacks in me sandwich was one o' the ways--"

Fin rolled his eyes. "Yeah, yeah. I ain't in the mood for 'nother story about one of the many fantastical ways the mob tried and failed to kill 'Iron Mike Malloy'. Don't see why you're always so smug about it. They got ya in the end, didn't they?"

Mike laughed again, jovially. "Sure an' it ain't whether ya win or lose, boyo -- it's how ya run the race! I gave every one o' those bastards an ulcer from the stress o' trying ta' do me in, an' failin' time after time. Besides, by the time the miserable sods finally *did* put me in the ground, I'd developed such a reputation for bein' indestructible that the coppers couldn't believe it had been an accident. They dug me up fer an autopsy, saw there'd been foul play, and all but one o' me killers got fried up like a mess o' praties an' onions in the 'lectric chair. The way I see it, that makes it 4-to-1 in my favor, if we're countin' corpses."

"Latimer, you know about shit, right?" Fin said, turning to Louis, and gesturing to the man's spectacles and business attire. "Bein' a man of letters and what-not -- sorta feller who always reads the papers?"

The man shrugged noncommittally. "I suppose."

"Well? Are these tall tales o' his even *true?"* Fin asked.

He sighed. "I can't say I remember reading about it, Phineas, but I don't know that something like this would have been *national* news..."

Mike snorted. "And when did you kick off, sir?"

Louis thought for a moment. "Nineteen...twenty-eight. Yes, it was '28." He groaned, leaning forward until his forehead rested on the bar. "I've been dead for almost a *century*, and I'm *still* not forgotten..."

Mike smirked. "Well, then ye *wouldn't* have heard o' me incredible exploits --  ya snuffed it *five whole years* too early, to bear witness to the adventures of Iron Mike Malloy."

Fin crossed his arms. "Story still sounds fishy to me."

Mike shrugged, picking up a glass to polish it. "Think what ya want, boyo, but if folks didn't still believe in me story, I wouldn't still be here, now would I? I'd be off to me final reward already, with all the other souls who lived quiet lives untouched by greatness."

"Just cause they *remember* yer legend, don't mean it's true." Fin retorted. "*I* know that much from personal experience."

Louis took a drink from his glass, and then set it down hard on the bar, scowling. "Doesn't it strike you gentlemen as *unfair?* That our reward in the hereafter for having memorable achievements is to have our eternal rest *forestalled?"*

Mike stroked his chin. "Can't say as I do -- I was raised Catholic meself. The priests *always* said I'd end up in purgatory fer a thousand years, if I didn't stop weighing down me soul with an overabundance of vices and venial sins. So far, I find the place to be *better* than advertised, if anything."

"Well *I* was a Unitarian." Louis said, crossly. "And I think this is ridiculous. Why should I be punished for *notoriety?* It isn't as though I asked for it."

Fin shot Louis a sidelong glance. "Really? Seems like you woulda had to know that you'd get yer name in all the papers. I mean, didn't you invent them electric lights everyone is usin' now-a-days?"

Louis slammed his hand down on the bar, and bellowed out an angry "NO!" Fin gaped at the normally reserved man, as Louis took a deep breath and calmed himself.

Mike shook his head. "Don't say that around Louis, Fin -- that's the sort o' talk that's keepin' him bound to the mortal world. See, he didn't invent the *bulb,* just the little squiggly bit inside that glows."

"No, that's *still* wrong!" Louis insisted, gritting his teeth. "I designed an *improvement* to the process of making carbon filaments for light bulbs! It was an achievement I was justifiably proud of, but *I* never claimed to be the 'real' inventor of the light bulb!"

"Well, you still did more'n I did to deserve this." Fin grumbled. "I was just mindin' my own business an' doing my job, when somebody called my name. I turned to look, and then BOOM! A three-foot long tamping iron got shot *right through my head* by a misfirin' blasting charge."

"Bloody hell." Mike exclaimed. "Don't know as even *I* woulda survived that. So that's why yer famous, for dyin' with a spike through yer face?"

"Naw, that's the hell of it: I didn't *die* from that, not right away, anyhow. I lived 12 more years.*"*

"The hell ya say!" Mike said, eyeing Fin skeptically.

"No, that I *can* corroborate." Louis said, tiredly. "I heard about it: Phineas Gage and the American Crowbar Case."

Fin snorted, derisively. "*Tamping iron,* not a crowbar -- folks never did get that part right. But yeah. Buncha smart-ass doctors got all excited about how having a yard of iron punch through my skull made all these 'changes' in my head, an' jumbled up my personality. They said it revealed all sorts of stuff about how brains worked."

Mike puffed out his cheeks. "Well, it may not have been your doin', but that *does* seem pretty bloody notable, Fin."

"It weren't even *true!"* Fin protested. "They said I was a completely diff'rent man after the accident, that it showed how scramblin' a feller's brain could make him into someone else. Only, that was cause it was *right after* the accident. Tarnation, I had a tamping iron shot through my head, then the wound went rotten, I was delirious with fever, an' I plumb near *died --*  hell if that ain't enough to change anybody's personality for a while. But the truth is, I went back to normal, once I healed up. I didn't turn into no *monster,* like what the stories say."

Louis raised an eyebrow. "Even so, I think you might be minimizing your own role in building your legend a *bit,* Phineas."

"How do you figure?" said Fin.

The other man chuckled, and took a sip from his glass. "When I was a boy, I used to work with my father in the evenings, hanging wallpaper. I remember one particular night, my father was contracted to paper the walls of an old theater that was being refurbished. We covered over a lot of old posters and flyers that were still glued to the walls, advertising various entertainments from the previous decade."

"So?" Fin asked.

"So," Louis continued, "One of them was for an unusual engagement from several years prior. As I recall, it was a double-billed touring act that had been travelling all over New England: 'The Two Wonders of the World'."

Fin's eyes widened, and then he groaned, placing his face in his hands.

Mike looked between the two men. "Care to let *me* in on the joke, fellas?"

Louis smirked. "The 'Two Wonders' named on the poster were 'The Dwarf Skeleton', a very small and thin dwarf gentleman who played the violin and sang...and the survivor of the so-called American Crowbar Case, one *Mr. Phineas Gage."*
