"For Love and Light! Kya!" Princess Celestia called out, boldly, as the Heart Corps formed up around her, their magical fuku-style battle uniforms materializing around them in a flurry of sparkling magical motes.

Across from them on the grassy plain, Queen Annihila threw back her head and laughed maniacally.

"Pathetic!" the alien monarch sneered, spreading her arms wide and levitating into the air amid a cluster of her monstrous minions, as forking bolts of dark magic crackled over her body. "You may have bested some of my lesser servants in the past, Heart Corps, but the Umbramorphs I've brought with me are among the strongest of their kind!"

Princess Celestia glowered determinedly at the evil queen, placing her hand to her forehead with the fingers boldly spread in a 'V' for victory. "Love will always triumph over hate, Annihila! Surrender now, or face the blazing fury of the stars!"

The Queen laughed again. "Nonsense!" She thrust her arm forward. "Umbramorphs -- devour these worthless interlopers!"

The monstrous black hulks of the Queen's servants  reared up, roaring and clawing at the earth, and then surged forward, trampling down the tall grass as they charged the magical heroines. The Heart Corps stood their ground, tiny points of magical light surrounding each of them like a nimbus of stardust.

Before the monsters had gone twenty feet, however, there was a loud "pop", and the head of the nearest one exploded in a spray of black blood and splintered bone.

"What?" the Queen cried, recoiling in surprise. "What magic is this?"

Celestia and the Heart Corps, however, looked equally confused.

The monsters skidded to a halt, eyes darting left and right, sniffing the air, seeking the source of their fellow's demise. Two more pops sounded, and two more misshapen heads exploded in impressive bursts of gore.

One of the Heart Corps covered her mouth, clearly fighting to keep her gorge from rising, and Princess Celestia watched with a mix of revulsion and confusion, as the rest of Annihila's minions were dispatched in short order by the invisible assassin. She jumped in surprise, as the radio given to her by the newest member of the Corps crackled softly at her waist.

"Secondary targets down, primary target in sight. I have the shot. HC-one, please advise." the voice on the radio said.

*"Brother Polaris!"* Celestia shouted, half panicked, as she clumsily pulled the radio free from where she'd clipped it to a broad silk ribbon around her waist. "Stop *shooting!* That isn't how the Heart Corps does things!"

"Copy that, HC-one, checking fire." the radio replied.

"What was *that?"* Queen Annihila demanded, fists planted on her hips.

Celestia placed a hand on the back of her neck, wincing awkwardly. "Sorry! We're, um....we're training someone new, this week. He thought he was joining some kind of mercenary company called *The Hard Corps,* but there was a mixup at the Heroic Employment Agency, and he ended up in the The Heart Corps. It's a long story."

Annihila made a disgusted sound, and smoothed her regal gown. "Whatever!" She landed back on the ground, and raised her hands, dark lightning crackling between them. "Even without my minions, you and your silly little band are still no match for me, *little girl!* Prepare to--"

Two large, calloused hands clamped down on the sides of her head, and jerked it sharply to one side. There was a sickening snap, the hands released the evil Queen, and Annihila collapsed to the ground like a puppet with its strings cut.

Celestia gaped in shock at the newest member of the Heart Corps looming over Annihila's corpse, clad in a ghillie suit that had made him all but invisible in the tall grass until this moment, a suppressed high-caliber sniper rifle slung across his back.

"Primary target neutralized with no shots fired, HC-one." Brother Polaris reported, calmly.

Celestia's mouth worked mutely, her face gone stark white. One of the other members of the Heart Corps vomited noisily into the grass.

"Oh, and uh, *for Love and Light.* Kee-yah.*"* Polaris added, belatedly throwing up a "V" sign across his forehead.
