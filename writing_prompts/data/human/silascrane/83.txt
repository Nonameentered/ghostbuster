"Why are we down here, Nike?" Kee asked, looking around as they descended the long staircase into the darkness, along with Jaa and Old Nike.

Old Nike sighed, glancing at his grand...child. What *was* the kid, anyway? Nothing about Kee's appearance gave Nike any context clues about their gender, and Kee was too young for their body shape to provide any clues. Everyone was supposed to be an individual, that was what the Netspeakers said, but the self-selected riot of colors and shapes in Kee's hair and clothes were just...visual *noise.* Purely superficial liberty and diversity to obscure the identical thinking the Netspeakers enforced. To be free, truly free, Nike knew, used to be a thing greater than that, truer than that, it used to be...the word escaped Nike.

"Would it kill you to call this one *Grandpa,* Kee?" Nike said, avoiding Kee's real question, and trying to keep the irritation out of his voice. 

Kee brightened. "Didja pick a new you-word? That's *great,* Nike -- er, this one should have said, Goo-ran-pa? Guran-paw? Wait, is it *Grand Paw?* Like, a really big doggo?"

He sighed again. Well, that was progress, sort of. 

"It's a *title,* Kee. Don't be *regressed."* Jaa said, rolling his eyes at his sibling. That one was a boy -- grand-*son,* Nike was pretty sure they'd been called. The definition was...son of his son? That definition had...the idea behind that word's definition *also* had a definition, but...but definition *extra. No,* that wasn't the word for what it had been to have a son, not "definition extra" but he couldn't have that word in his brain, not just yet. 

"Grand Paw isn't *content*, not like a vid or a song. That one is *people,* and people have you-words, not *titles."* Kee insisted.

"Enough." he chided, gently, as the reached the end of the stairs, their lowest point. "Kee, Jaa is right: once, people could have titles, too. And a title didn't cause people to be less, it caused people to be...greater than less...blast the language filters!  And you, Jaa, as for being 'regressed'...hopefully, that's what we're all about to be."

The children looked at each other, curiously, and then back at Nike, as the elder one opened the steel door, and ushered his charges inside, closing it afterward. For a few seconds, the group was plunged into darkness, but then the lights in the steel-walled place came on.

Mike sighed, deeply, a smile spreading across his deeply lined face. "Finally. Thank *God."*

Kee staggered, slightly. "Ow! What...this one feels...strange."

Jaa placed a hand to his head, and groaned. "This one does, too, Grand Paw."

*"I,* children." Mike corrected, gently.

"The...letter?" Jaa asked, confused.

"The *word.* Like 'A', 'I' can be a word by itself. It is the word you use to refer to yourself." Mike explained. He scowled. "Not 'this one' -- what cumbersome *nonsense* they've forced on us!"

Kee winced, covering her ears. "W-what was the sound you just did?"

Jaa did not react as strongly, be he, too, seemed disturbed. Realization dawned on Mike. Of course. *Cumbersome.* 

Mike motioned the children forward, and crouched down to their eye level. "Do you trust Grandpa?"

They looked at each other uncertainly, and then each gave a firm nod. He swelled with pride. These children were the children of his son, they were related to him by blood...and that fact had *meaning. That* had been the word he couldn't form in his mind outside this place: meaning, the thing that the Netspeakers, who promised to give the people who listened to their commands everything, *took* from all those who followed them. 

"Then listen carefully." Mike said. He pointed to his mouth. "Press your lips together -- tight, like this, see? Now, try to say the letter 'h'."

They hesitated, looking at one another.

"But, y-you can't say 'h' like that, Grand Paw." Jaa said, nervously. 

"I know, son." Mike said, gently. "But that's not why you're hesitating. That's not why it feels scary. It because they've conditioned you not to create this sound. They don't want you to have it. So you have to *try."*

Jaa took a deep breath. 

"Hhhhh-mmmmmmmmmm...." he said, furrowing his brow in concentration. Then he opened his eyes wide, touching his forehead. "It feels...different."

Mike nodded, and touched the spot on his own forehead. "It's the sound -- the particular resonance of it interferes with the device they put in your skull when you were born. Puts it into a feedback loop for a bit. They could never fix that flaw. It's why they banned this sound, and tried to erase it in brains and content alike, until no one could recall it."

Kee squeaked in fear, taking a step back. She looked ready to bolt. Mike started towards her, but to his suprise, Jaa intervened first.

Jaa reached out his hand to his younger sibling, confidently. "Kee...it's okay."

Kee swallowed hard, but then took their sibling's hand, squeezing it tightly.

"Hmmmmmmm" Mike hummed, demonstrating the sound again for Kee's benefit.

Kee closed their eyes.

"Haaaa...huuu..." Kee breathed, sweat forming on their brow. And then, finally, blessedly:

*"Hmmmmmmm..."*

Kee's face lit up, eyes wide. "This one...uh...*I* did it!"

Tears in the corners of his eyes, Mike embraced his grandchildren. "You did. You both did. Use this sound, and use it often -- that will keep the device in a feedback loop, and keep the Netspeakers from taking your brains...your *minds* again."

"Grand Paw," Jaa asked, after a moment, his arms still around his grandfather and sibling. "What you called...called *I* earlier...what does it mean? What is 'son?'"

Mike's voice caught in his throat. He felt pain, and more distantly anger. So much had been stolen from these children. **M**eaning. **M**ind. Fa**m**ily. In *Mike's* case, they'd taken part of his very identity. It seemed that eliminating that one letter had a gone a long way towards eliminating ideas and concepts that were a threat to the system. 

"Well," he said, voice hoarse with emotion. "In short, 'son' is...it's kind of...well, a title. Like..." he paused, chuckling at their rendering of the word, "Like 'Grand Paw' is a title. The definition...the *meaning,* is that...that you and I are *part of each other."* 

Jaa smiled softly. "I am...a son. I...I like that title."

"Me too." Mike said, clearing his throat.

"Grand Paw," Kee asked, hesitantly, pulling away. "Does this...does *I* have a title?"

Jaa looked at him questioningly, clearly worried that his sibling would be left out.

Mike hesitated. Kee *did,* he was sure, but there was no easy way to tell what it was -- the language had been mangled in such a way that it was hard to even *ask* questions like that. Then, suddenly, it struck him.

"Before I tell you your title, Kee, listen to this story," he said, conversationally, "I was walking out past the playing field, and someone kicked a friendship orb way up into the air. Well, I wasn't paying attention to where I was going, unfortunately, so the ball came down and hit Grand Paw *right between the legs."*

Jaa instinctively winced, "Oof!"

"Did it hurt a lot?" Kee asked, looking confused.

"Yes," Mike said, laughing, then pulled Kee into another hug. "But don't worry about that, I'm fine now. And *your* title, little one, is *daughter."*
