"Dad?" Ricky said, in surprise.

An older man with gray hair fell through the air beside him. He looked like Ricky's father, although his dad had never grown his hair or beard so long, as far as he remembered. Instead of being stretched out facing downward in preparation to knife into the surface of the pool, the old man sat upright with his legs crossed beneath him, as though he was meditating.

The man didn't respond. Ricky looked around frantically, in an attempt to orient himself. He was falling fast, such that his surroundings were just a blur of color. He might have been anywhere, for all that he could see.

"Hi!" said a cheerful voice from behind him.

He twisted around, and saw a small boy, swimming back and forth through the air easily. He wore a pair of bright yellow "floaties" on his arms, along with matching goggles, and a pair of baggy swimming trunks patterned after Spider-Man's costume. The boy waved to him, and Ricky suddenly recognized the child -- it was *him.*

"I was seventeen, the first time I realized what I was doing..." the old man said, suddenly. The boy continued his merry swimming, oblivious to the man, but Ricky turned back to the meditating man who so closely resembled his dad.

His eyes were still closed, but he continued speaking. He sounded hesitant, almost like he was reciting a story from memory. "It had happened once before, when I'd almost drowned as a child. But at that time, I thought it had just been a dream I'd had while I was unconscious."

The old man's eyes -- *Ricky's* eyes -- opened, and he looked directly at him. "Seventeen. That was when I learned that I...that we...could *dive through time."*
