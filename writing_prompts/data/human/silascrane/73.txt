I never forget how I've been treated by people. That, in itself, isn't so uncommon. What makes me different than most people, is the ability to do something to balance the scales -- quietly, and with impunity.

It was with just such a balancing of the scales in mind, that I admired my collection of hermetic poppets, little handmade dolls that each represented one of a score of friends, family and acquaintances. I kept every effigy in its own labeled cubby, laid out in a 20 x 20 clear acrylic grid, itself inside a locked display case made of tempered glass, and all of which was secreted away in the back of my bedroom closet. 

Most people would call my little friends "voodoo dolls", but that's rather misleading. The mystical principle by which my constructs function is far more ancient and universal than voodoo, which is a relatively recent iteration of West African folk religion practiced in Haiti, New Orleans, and elsewhere in the African diaspora.

Reaching into my shirt, I pulled out the small key I wore on a sturdy chain of tiny titanium links around my neck, and unlocked the cabinet. Tracing over the dolls with my index finger, I removed the poppet that represented my elderly landlady, Mrs. Ochmonek, and smiled fondly down at the tiny, frail effigy, before carefully carrying it over to my ritual altar. 

I set it inside the complex geometric seal etched into the wood of the altar, and lit four candles around it. 

Then, taking up a pair of sharp craft shears, I cut its legs off. 

This didn't dismember my landlady, of course. Even if the effigy had been powerful enough -- which, as I hadn't been able to obtain any of her blood for its construction, it probably wasn't -- the ritual circle contained its magic, and prevented changes to the doll from effecting her while the candles around the binding circle remained lit.

Using a razor knife, I carefully slit the seams along the back of the severed legs and discarded the stuffing, so I could lay the fabric flat. Then, using that as a pattern, I traced the shape of the legs onto a piece of new cloth I'd gotten from a local textile supplier. Though he'd been perplexed as to why I would want to know such a thing, the supplier assured me *this* particular coarse cotton knit was from a recent batch, woven in only the past few days. 

Once I'd cut the fabric to shape, I carefully stitched the halves of the cloth legs together, stuffed them with new cotton batting and then sewed them onto the effigy of Mrs. Ochmonek. This was all I had to do to complete the working, since the old upper half of the doll already contained the necessary personal effects -- strands of her hair, fibers from her clothing, and so forth -- that linked the effigy with the old woman it was modeled after. Having made these alterations, I blew out the candles, lifted the doll from the altar, and my magic was accomplished. 

You may be surprised that I completed this process without consorting with any capricious pagan gods, evil demons, or mysterious *loa,* in the course of my working, but I simply had no need to. The principle by which my magic works, as I said, is something universal, laid down with the very foundations of the cosmos: As above, so below. Microcosm and macrocosm. Bound on Earth, bound in Heaven.

The next day, I saw her in the hallway, on her way back to her own apartment. She was walking down the corridor with a bag of groceries in one arm. 

"Let me get that for you, Mrs. Ochmonek." I offered, walking up to her to relieve her of her burden while she unlocked her door.

She smiled warmly, as I took the bag from her. "Oh thank you , John. You're such a nice boy." Her gentle, sincere praise felt like a ray of sunshine, even about something so simple. 

"How are you feeling today -- knees still acting up?" I asked, casually, as she rummaged for her keys in her oversized pink purse.

"No, actually -- you know, I woke up this morning and my legs felt *brand new.* I think that 'turmeric' stuff Mrs. Henry told me to try must really be working." she said, cheerfully, as she fished out her keys and got her door open. 

"I'm sure that's it." I said, amiably, handing her groceries off to her, as she got inside. "And how's your grandson Benny?"

"Wonderful!" she said, proudly. "He just got the acceptance letter from the college. He and his parents are coming over tonight, and we're all going to celebrate."

"That's great to hear." I replied, with a smile. That had been a tricky working -- *getting accepted into college* is a hard thing to depict on a tiny cloth doll. But fortunately, Benny had already done a lot of the work himself; making a little hooded sweater with the college logo and adding it to the poppet I'd made of him had evidently been just enough to put him over the top.

Knowing she needed to get ready for her family dinner, I said my goodbyes and walked down the hall to my apartment, with a spring in my step. 

Like I said, I don't forget how I've been treated. But the slights and bad turns aren't what I choose to carry with me. Whether you have the means to avenge yourself or not, carrying things like that around inside you is corrosive to the soul. 

Instead, I don't forget the good turns, the favors done, or the sacrifices made on my behalf. Like the handful of times I'd been late on my rent, and kind old Mrs. Ochmonek had cut me some slack. After all, if you're going to hang on to something, why not cling to the good things, and by extension, to the people who brought them into your life? 

Every doll in my collection was such a person. Each one knew I was grateful for them, and for the things they'd done, of course. But as for what I did for them, in turn? 

That's just my little secret.
