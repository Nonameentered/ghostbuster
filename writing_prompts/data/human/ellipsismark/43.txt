Author note: Well that was nice. Liked writing that. Reddit almost didn't let it post because I don't know. Okay, so details

-ages: Mira and Enoch are in high school. So between 14 and 18. I don't know. Adulthood is 21 in my world anyways, so whatever

-Mutants: mutants are a type of "Demi human" in my r/worldofdemihumans which include a lot of different kinds. Mira and Nathan have strength. Enoch and Queen have ice. Diana is also a mutant, but I didn't make a power for her.

-Goons? Of what?: Enoch, Queen, and the goons are a part of The Brotherhood of Mutants. One part gang, one part civil rights group. They make for good heroes and villains for my world.

-Happy ever after: Umm... yeah sure. I know teen love isn't that... umm... believed in(?), but I like "Life long bonds" so I guess they stay together. Who knows. I certainly don't.

-Edits: I read through it and saw some mistakes. I swear, Reddit is impossible some times.
