Author note's: Oh yeah, short and sweat, insert dick joke.

I liked this one. Another chance to expand my expanding universe, and I managed  to keep in one comment. Greg Ranger will definitely come up again if I get the chance.

Okay, if anyone has been reading my stuff, doubt it but still, all my stories start with "Quotes" either from actual history, in world history, or fictional works with in this world. This one is completely made up and is suppose to be from the "For Tomorrow" series. What is it about? Don't know really. I'm think robot empire vs magical nature spirits.

Ask me anything about my work so far if you want.
