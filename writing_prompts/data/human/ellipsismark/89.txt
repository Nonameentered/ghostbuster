\[2/4\]

New World Academy of Magical Craft and Refinement stood over the back drop of the town of West Huntington, a town outside of the official American border but still valued their laws. It was founded by a wizard who brokered peace the native population and the migrating Europeans. A fair number of students were either natives are had native lineage. I didn't. I was a pure blooded mix of German and French.

The front gates were wide as students filed through under the watch of staff. My rock familiar was in my backpack but I hoping to just pass through undetected so I hiding a tree. As I hid I was reminded of an old saying that my grandfather apparently use to say. The only time someone is going to look at your shoes is when they have a hole in theirs. Well I definitely had a hole because I couldn't help but notice everyone else's familiars. Many were rather standard. Cats and owls and a few dogs. Some however had huge familiars of prestige. One boy had a whole gyphon. Another one a Great Eagle. There was apparently a girl with a horse familiar, who I made sure to annoy talking to at all cost. Then there was her. The princess of Virginia, which said a lot since Virginia was a democracy. Elizabeth Woodwock was obvious with her familiar. He looked like a normal man dressed in a fine suit, but he was well known. He was a dragon, and he was the familiar of the Woodwock family.

As he walked forward I saw my chance. The staff began to greet the royalty and students stared. No one was looking at the far right of the gate and so I made my move. I lightly jogged up the hill with no one the wiser. That damn showoff was distracting everyone. I was yards away when the staff walked Woodwock and her dragon through the gate. The mass students moved to and I was in middle. A nobody with nothing to say after a whole ass dragon strolled through. I was free.

"Not so fast young man!" a voice boomed at I was lifted into the air. A fit man with a teacher's suit and solid line of sliver in his black hair floated me over and set me down. "I saw you sulking in the woods for a whole hour, and now you're trying to enter these hollowed hall without a welcome. Young man you are not being slick or charming. I hope you understand that."

'I, I was..." I tried to think of something you get me out of this. I thought about lying, but that would only work for one question at a time. Apologizing might work, but then I might have to tell the whole truth. Running a bitch was looking tempting, but that ran the risk of them just zapping me. Or worse, me getting away and having to give up dreams. I would zap myself before doing that. So I guess I was going to have to take my licks.

"I'm sorry." I apologized, "I just didn't want to be noticed."

"Shy?" He cocked an eyebrow which was half silver at the end.

"No, not exactly." My voice shook as I told the truth, "Embarrassed."

"Embarrassed? Over what?" He looked me up and down, "Hand me downs?"

I was wearing the boys uniform I inherited. It have actually been through many generations of New World Academy student. Possibly the first generations in fact. It was very well made. "No. Not that. I'm okay with my uniform."

"Then what? Are you missing reading material? Well there's certainly no excuse for that. The freshmen basics have been the same and in print for over 300 years. But if you really couldn't find a book as rare as the bible then the school can-"

"No no," I cut him off, "I have books, but they are old." I removed my aged tomes from my back pack and he examined them. They were also well made.

"Indeed. This books are over 200 years old. Impressive." He looked over the pages, "They even notes on the notes. This is a treasure for a freshmen indeed."

"Yep," hope was whispering from its grave into my ear as I took the books back, "Well I'll be-"

"Young man, tell me, where is your familiar?" The man looked around and in the sky as my hope dug deeper into its six foot grave.

"Well, you see," I started but the man sighed before i could.

"Young man. A familiar is necessary for enrollment in New World Academy for everyone. I understand it can be a daunting task to find a suitable match, but it's required."

"I have a familiar." I said with no hope.

"You do? Then where is it?"

I pulled my bag forward and reached deep into my bag and pulled out Rockstar. He looked at Rockstar for a moment before pointing at him and saying, "That is a rock."

"Yes." I said dead inside.
