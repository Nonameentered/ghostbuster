"This is unprecedented." Said Mistress Owlbark, an old granny who held back firm, "But your sure this young man is familiar with the rock?"

"Yes, I did the detection spell three times." Said Master Luke, my silver striped interrogator, "The boy has a familiar link with the rock. How, I don't know."

"Young man, tell me again how you came across this stone?"

"I saw a ad in the newspaper. It said 'Good Familiar At Cheap. Ask Wood Fairies For Mad Micheal' so I did." I explained in what look like a teacher's office, "I didn't just go without cautious. I asked fairies that I knew and made sure I had an escape spell ready and also my mom where I was-"

"Yes Yes young man. We're sure you're not a total idiot." Master Luke cut in. "The with the stone he passes all the requirement for the entrance exam. I suggest we allow him to try his best. If he flunks then we have to worry about."

My stomach turned to stone denser than Rockstar, "Right. The exam."

I was taken back to the main group of student and was set into the tests. New World had a ranked system in which everyone was rank in different categories: Knowledge, Skill, and Power. Knowledge was basic know how of magic. The test was a writing one using multiple choice, true false, short answers, drawing diagrams, and even a few essay prompt across fifty page. With only two hours to work in the teachers were very clear they we were not suppose complete the exam in full, or even close to that. We were suppose to answer what we could. So it was dozens of student were flipping through the pages trying to find something they already knew.

The Skill Test was a combination of solving simple puzzles, performing not so simple tricks without physical no connect, and outlining a few complex spell. The first was to test out the student thinking skills, the second was to test direct control of our magic, and the third to test how well we come set a foundation for a casting. Everyone seemed to struggle with at least one of the test. Some could understand the how to jump a whole board of checkers, some kept drop the ball they were trying to loop through, and some just couldn't draw a circle right.

The Power Test was the easiest to understand and definitely everyone's favorite. It was casting spells. Simple, beginner level spells. As hard as you could. They have seven stations set up and were cycling everyone through them. Fireball, Lightening Bolt, Wind Gust, Plant Growth Enhancement, Light Shining, Darkness Cover, and finally Water Freezing. Explosions filled the courtyard as the Fireball and Lightening Bolt stations kept booming out thunder. The Wind Gust station were unimpressive as few seem to understand how to make the air move for them, and Darkness Cover was the least used as many had no idea how to even begin casting.

At the end of the exam everyone was at their limits and were sent to dining hall to receive their reward of a very large meal for sticking it through the whole way. The meal was basic foods like a stew and bread. It meant to be to mass produce for mass consumption. Magic was hard work, and the energy to shape the universe had to come from somewhere. Which is why it took two bowls of stew to get my stomach from rudely demanding food to politely requesting a third. I was on my way to fulfill this request when Mistress Owlbark came out on the upper ledge and got attention.

"Attention Students." She started. Her was loud enough to fill the room. "We have finished the ranking the of test and are please to announce all of you manage to pass the minimum requirement."

The room roared with cheers of joy and sighs of relief. "Furthermore, we have ranked all of you in the three categories. Here are the top 100 in each. You all have at least one spot on here." And with a wave of a wand she summon three blackboards. Each holding a numbered list of hundred names, and as I looked over them my blood became ice. My stomach was silent as I saw something that going to make my life almost impossible. I was on all three of the list, and I was the only student, expect one other, you have made it in the top 10 on all three. Number 8 in Knowledge, Number 7 in Skill, and Number 10 in Power. In my desperation I had stupidly applied all of my effort.

On the Knowledge Test rather than skim every page I skimmed every even numbered page as many questions covered subjects were also cover by nearby question. So I skipped half of the packet answer about a third of the question I looked over. In skill I easily solve the puzzles and floated the objects through they courses, and even showed my ambidextrous nature. In power I unleash my full power and held nothing back. Which was the reason my stomach had been so angry before, but now was wanting to return its tribute. Now being at the top was the problem. No. It wasn't that I was at the top of the three lists. It was that My Name was at the top of the list. In front of God and everybody my full legal name was in full display in the most looked at position. Danial Starfinder Weber II

The whisper started immediately and grew as more noticed. Others said variate, but the general vibe was the same. Concern, fear, and hatred.

"Starfinder? Like the guy who tried to end the world?"

But out of everyone one voice come over then.

"How dare!" Said Elizabeth Woodwock looking around with an anger glare, "How dare you?"

I was in completely despair and apparently it showed on my face because Elizabeth took one good at me and zeroed in.

"It's you! You're the son of the that traitor!" She approached with murder in her eyes, "And you dare disgrace these hollowed halls with you traitorous filth!"

I was terror struck. I have acted so foolish. I was so damn focused on my stupid 'Rock Familiar' that I forgot that everyone who knew who I was would hate me. I had not only did nothing you hide my identity like request an alias with the staff, but actually put in the effort to be more obvious by rank in the top 10 in all three list. Now everyone knew and would want to get their licks in, and it seemed like Woodwock would be the first.

"You're the spawn of a foul traitor! A tainted lineage! You don't deserved to be here." And on that last bit something snapped in me. All of my fear lifted and only anger remained.

"What! I don't deserve to be here? Check the list again, doll face. I'm one of the best here, and I'll be damned to hell before I just throw that away!" I shouted back, "Another thing, I won't claim pride of my father, but he's still my family, and I won't have you speak ill of him! No matter what!"

Her face was an hateful statue, "Fine. I declare a duel."

The crowd inhaled as did I. Duels were common enough among wizards. A challenge in which agreement could be stapled on to bind the loser. Many wars between spellcasters were avoided by having powerful casters duke it out rather than have armies bending the universe until it snapped.

"Now now children, let's remain calm." Master Luke had made his way down and over to me, "No one is dueling today. We need to setup housing and class schedules."

"No," Elizabeth said, "By the school's own rules I'm allowed to challenge any one within ten ranks of me, and it never says it has to be after even time set. Furthermore, those same rule say that the challenge can be declare to all three ranking in the form of a duel."

Master Luke clearly was not happy to be so boldly defied, "Lady Woodwock, I will not allow this to go through as such. We settle the schedule first."

"No," I chimed in, "She's right. She's allowed to declare a duel if we're with ten ranks in all three rankings, and there's no rule saying she can't do as soon as rankings are relieved. Also, I want this."

Master Luke went from anger to concern, "Are you sure?"

I stared down Elizabeth. I had been sent in exile with my mother and sister because of my father at only seven. I have to learn so much by myself using the resource he had left behind when he escaped. His books were the old tome I had brought with me, and it was his uniform that I wore just as he did, and his father before him and so forth the first Weber who went this school. We were once as rich as the Woodwock, but all I had now were his books, some tailored cloth, and a burning passion for magic. "Yes."
