Author note: Sweet Mercy. I hate Reddit. After spending more time than I should have I managed over 5k words on this racking up 30k characters. That wouldn't be so bad if reddit's text box weren't trash. Oh well. I liked it. Hopefully some others will also like, but I do think I'm past the prime time for this one.

-So just to note Pop Gun: 32 caliber with 30 rounds. Big Shot: 500 Magnum, yes I know how big that. You want that size bullet in this line of work. Also, the frame is screwed tight together to prevent malfunction to combat scenarios so you have manually turn the cylinder to reload each bullet. Trust me, they rather be reliably slow than quickly fucking up.

-what else, oh, when Danforth explode the web shot, he did than by hocking a loogie at it. It just wasn't revealed than Danforth was turning into fire. Which he was doing with the spit on the cigarettes and his own sweat. Yes, he can turn the water of his body into fire. Yes, he can do this with his urine. I was going to write in a joke about that, but cut it at the end because I'm tired.

-ask any question you may have.
