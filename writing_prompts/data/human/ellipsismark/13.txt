Quickie:

One young doctor sits among the army of doctors all trying to solve the problem at hand. Suddenly an idea. He speaks to the oldest man there, his teacher, "Hey, what if we just... treated everyone?"

The young doctor's teacher looked him directly in eye and asked, "I'm sorry, who are you?"
