Quickie. 

My sister wrapped bandages around my forearms, "So did you just sleep through the lesson on Catalyst Theory?"

"Shut up." I grumbled as I held my bloodied arm to my chest.

"You have to pull, shape, and send at the same time." She said like the know it all she was.

"I know." I said. Her lecture was worse than the pain, but her lecture won't kill him like bleeding out would.

"If stop pulling mid casting the spell falls apart and starting whipping around." She tied the bandages down and then sat with hands on hip. "You're welcome."

"Yeah yeah. Thanks." I said as stood and walked off to my bed room to wallow in my dumbass shame.

Fin.
