Part 2 of "The Nineties Kids"

Steven wasn't taking the lose of his wife well, and the edgelords didn't help. They mocked and belittled him and his late wife. One boy in particular. A 17 year old with no respect became the prime harasser, and nothing stopped him of harassing Steven. The FBI even stepped in told him to stop, or he could be arrested. Thing was, the boy's dad was rich, and lawyered up immediately. The boy, feeling no fear or concern went too far and sent a real doll to Steven Whitewood model after Diana. Two days after receiving the this final straw Steven shot the boy with a shotgun. Police fired on him after shooting into the sky, then turning the barrel on them. Sadly, like I said, things didn't better.

Only Paul was posting videos now, and they were only updates on what he was building. Cities, and statues, and amusement parks. Until recently, he post at least once a week and he never visited the graveyard they made, but of course news came through. Eventually Lindsey Chipton, Ben Mercedes, Dave Smith, and Rick Gaye were confirmed to pass.

So there I was. Riding a train to nowhere Kansas to find Paul Leave. Luckily i had searched around and found a hospital admittance with the name Paul Leave and decided to put all my chips on that.

The hospital was an older building, built in the 30's making it about 20 years older that me. I walked straight to the front desk and said, "Hello, I'm here to see Paul Leave. I'm his grandson." and prayed the women at the front desk bought it.

"One moment." and the women walked to the back. I took a sit.

Some time later a doctor came up to me and only said, "Paul Leave has no children. Who are you?"

"I... uhh... that is I... umm... never knew him," I clicked and ran with what I had, "That is my dad knew him, because his mom never told Paul Le- I mean Mr. Leave about him, but I wanted to him."

The doctor pitched the bridge of his nose, "Right, I don't care. Just me the truth."

"I'm fan. Of the The nineties that is, of Paul Leave. And I wanted to see him. Meet him." I told the truth.

"Okay." and the doctor guided me to the room where Paul Leave was and left me.

He sitting in bed watching some old cartoons on a "boomrang" stream. "Paul Leave?"

He turned his head and looked at me and his eyes widen in surprise, "Who are you?"

"A fan... sir," and I told about me. About how I grew watching him and The Nineties Kids as they roamed around The Cool Kids Table. How I've watched and rewatched best of video and how I've watched every video, at least had them in the background as a cleaned my room and apartment. I told everything I could think of, and told me so many thing. About his time in game development to how he met the other members of The Nineties Kids and how they decided to start the channel.

"Paul, why did you keep doing it?" asked after some time, "Why keep making videos? Even after everyone else..." I couldn't finish that one.

Paul shrugged, "Habit. I liked making the stuff I made and I was use to recording and posting it. That's it."

I nodded and he just smiled.

He grabbed notepad and pen started to write, "i want you to do something for me, kid." He pointed a box on a shelf, I grabbed, "I got no kin. No sibling, no cousins, no kids. I when I die the state will bury my real body, but-" he pulled a set of keys, "who no one will bury my minecraft body. Kid, I want you to do that for me. Make a grave like the others," and he handed my the keys along with the notepad containing his address and passwords, "Please."

I took them, trying not to cry, and said, "Yes sir."

A week later Paul Leave died in the middle of the finale of the old show "Gravity Falls". He just grabbed his chest and started to gasp. The nurse came in and tried to save him, but in the end the last Nineties Kid was gone.

The doctors and nurse thanked me for being with him and I thanked them. I left the hospital and went Paul Leave's house. A small house in a small neighbor. A walked in searched the house and found Paul Leave's set up. It was only a modest PC with one screen, but a capture card going a laptop. I booted up both the desktop and laptop and launched Minecraft 3. I enter under my own account, it didn't feel right playing under Paul Leave's account. I started a capture on the laptop schedule a live stream for later that evening. I was almost late, because a neigh called the police on me, but after explaining everything, showing the key, and calling the hospital they believed me. I apologized to the neighbors, and they apologized. Turns out they were fans too.

I started the stream. Over a million people, "Hello, you don't know me, but I am here to give... to give... to give remembrance and burial to Paul Leave, who has passed away." I gave a short speech and allow the chat to chat, banning those who made jokes at the expense of others. Then came time for burial. A stone, and chest. A single diamond pickaxe.
