"To be born of greatness is to inherit greatness. So it is we have a responsible to prepare our offspring just as parent does. Our immorality does not excuse us. Our moral children will never inherit our estates or our property or our wealth, but they will inherit our greatness."

\-Zeus, King of Olympic, at the International Peace Conversion.

"Ms. Venus, thank you for coming." Mr. Galacto stood and offered his hand to the goddess.

"Oh please. Call me Aphrodite." She told his hand and shook, "I desire such formalities in my everyday life."

"As you say, and I certainly hope I'm not taking too much time from you, but we need to discuss your son's classroom performance." Mr. Galacto gestured to a seat next to a teenage boy seating in front of his desk.

"Yes yes," Aphrodite sat, "What could my little Paris be struggling with? It's not history is it? Oh tell my boy is having problems with history of all things."

"Oh no, nothing like. In fact his academics are rather good. It's the other part of his education. The part he gets from you." Mr. Galacto explained.

"I don't understand." Aphrodite tilled head thinking, "The part he gets from me?"

"He's talking about how I don't belong here." The boy named Paris spoke up. "I don't have powers and abilities or anything. I'm only a demi-human in the literal sense. That why they put me in class J from all place."

"Nonsense. You're just a late bloomer." Aphrodite turned to her son, "You're only fourteen. It takes time for these things to start."

"I've read the puberty books mom, but there's different between body hair and crazy superpower. I got nothing in that department." Paris simply stared at the clock. "Sir, I have elective class soon. May I be excuse?"

"Yes Mr. Paris, I have some more things to discuss with your mother." Mr. Galacto excused the boy. After he walked out he turned his attention Aphrodite, "Do you see the issue?"

"Yes, and I'm not surprised. My lineage has always been of the most subtle." Aphrodite rubbed her temples, "But I ensure you I do not want to transfer out, and neither would his father, rest his soul."

"Aphrodite, That's not the issue." Mr. Galacto said, "He issue is that he can't recognize his own ability nor does he try to find something great about himself. See here," Mr. Galacto some papers from his desk and showed them Aphrodite, "Paris is by far the most creative of his class. I've asked all the other teachers and they agree that Paris constantly produces writing assignment that meet the requirements, shows understanding of the subject, while also being entertaining to read. He's also been showing an ability in other arts. Plus, there's something that had only recently developed."

Aphrodite looked over the papers and looked up, "What's that?"

Paris walked through walks and stopped at his locker. Quickly opening and getting his books he was surprised to find a sophomore girl there.

"Hey, you're that Paris guy, yeah?" she asked.

"Yeah, can I help you? I'm heading a class." replied Paris.

"Oh! Well, I was wondering if you had plan this weekend." 

"Not really. There's a gaming tournament at a game shop I go to."

"Oh, I like games, maybe we could go. Together." She seemed nervous at the idea.

"I don't really like to just watch others play, and I'm not good enough to really enter, but they give prizes. So you should enter if you think your go enough." And with that Paris continue to his class leaving the girl behind. As he waked through the halls he saw a group of girls that seem to looking at him whispering. Paris picked up his pace.

"So yeah, it remain passive on but he lack the confidences need to think about it in a way that would allow him to figure it out." explained Mr. Galacto, "But he's having a clear effect on the females of the school. Faculty have the mental discipline to resist it easily but it's causing wave in the students."

Paris entered his elective class and took. There were only a few other students. Latin wasn't the most popular subject. As the Paris set his book out a girl came up beside. 

"Can I sit here?" she asked, "I, umm... forgot my textbook."

Paris offer the spot and the two looked over their notes. "I'm Sofia, by the way. Sofia Erebus."

Paris looked over her Sofia. She was dressed in dark on dark clothes with grim designs. "Paris. Louis Paris." 

"You seem.. distraught." Sofia remarked.

"I'm just not doing well." Paris went over the lesson.

Sofia stared at him for a moment. "You know, life sucks, but talking about it can make it suck less."

Paris thought about it, "Umm... okay."

The end. I'm done here.
