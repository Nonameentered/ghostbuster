Author's note: meh, Forgot to add a few things between breaks. Like how the mole person was a warrior leader or how the mole people's body are stronger and tougher, but have a lower and slower recovery rate. But I feel like was already going into too much world building and too little story telling. They built their technology on no smoke oil usage and only used the light of manga when needed. I also wanted to have a fight scene, but I couldn't get a flow to it going, so I called it quits.

Also forgot to make a quote. Oh well.
