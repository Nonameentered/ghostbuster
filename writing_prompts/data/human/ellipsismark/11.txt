This is literally a theme in my r/worldofdemihumans

The elevator dinged and opened revealing Benjamin North the small army of armed men pointing their guns at him. With a smile, he stepped off the elevator and across the room to the reception desk and started dinging the bell. The gunmen kept their guns aimed at him, "Hello, I'm here to see the Demon Baron Tal'ka Noose. Hello."

He continued to ding the bell over and over and over. Eventually, a man in a full suit stepped into the room and strolled behind the reception desk. He stared at Benjamin who simply kept dinging the bell. The man shot a hand over the bell between Benjamin's dings and in a smooth push down flatten the bell. Returning to his dignified stance, "Name one reason I shouldn't have these fine men replace your blood and bones with lead."

"Because you can't." Was Benjamin's response.

The man nodded, "Very well. This way if you please."

The two men followed a path down a hall lined with art made for kings, and at the end, a door made of wood so fine that it likely costed more than a politician. They opened and enter a room that definitely cost more than a politician, and at the end behind a desk was the Tal'ka Noose, The Demon Baron of Jersey City.

"Good morning Mr. Noose. My name is Benjamin North. I'm here to fuck up your whole day." Benjamin introduced himself.

"I know who you are Mr. North. I also know that if I can reasonably believe that you are wasting my time, I can end yours." Baron Noose seemed at first glance like a mundane human, but it was the second glance that reveal the telltale sign of his true form. The red iris that glowed just that couldn't be sure if it was just a reflection. The jet-black hair that never seemed to be perfectly still. The fingernails that looked a little sharper than they should. And of course, the absolute vile look of hatred that drilled into everything they landed.

"Then I'll get to the point. The Moondust Family is suing for the death of their youngest member." Benjamin explained, "You took what they held most valuable. Now they want what you hold most valuable."

"The brat came into my territory and caused problems of his own will."

"Yes, but he was registered as a diplomat, and you killed him without warning."

"Registration was made after he enter my turf."

"But before you killed him. Ain't bureaucracy amazing."

"The death was made in response to a request to a human the fairy boy had in his possession."

"Yes, we know. She told us when she contacted us because you took her into your possession."

"We took her into our protection."

"Yeah. What a bitch. Am I right? Still, here we are. Now you going to pay, or am I going to have to file for a court date" Benjamin said. He stared the Baron in the eye when a small came from the back.

"Dad? Who is this man? Is he causing trouble?" A asked from the doorway off to the side of the door. He was barely ten at most and had the red eyes of a demon. He scowled at Benjamin, "You better not be threatening my dad! Because I don't take threats very well."

"Adrian! Get out of here! NOW!" Baron Noose yelled scaring the young boy. He gulped and gave one last dirty Benjamin before closing the door.

"Cute kid." Benjamin said.

"He's nothing. Don't you concern yourself with him."

"Ooh, sounds like you care. Is he what you value most?" Benjamin crossed his arms.

Tal'ka Noose stared at the man with a hatred that could kill. Literally. A lesser being would have burned away under it, this just stood there. "I don't understand. Our files said you hate fairies."

"Oh, I do. I hate all fairies. I have them crucified on I-beams if I could. And pour iron shaves on them just for fun, but I hate people like you far more."

"People like me?" Noose narrowed his eyes.

"People who think they do whatever they want just because no one can stop them." Benjamin explained, "Going around and shaping the world how they want just because they don't what to be inconvenienced. And I have the silver tongue of a fairy, so you know I'm telling the truth. Now pay up."

"I have nothing of value. All that I possess is nothing but a catch in my whims." Noose said, "What the fairies ask for does not exist. I have no obligation to amuse their demands."

"What about the kid? I bet he got a mom too." Benjamin said.

"I said he is nothing."

"You willing to say that under oath in a court of law?"

Baron Noose stared the man down. "Leave. Tell the fairies to make their schedule. They will get nothing."

"Alright then. Have a nice day." And with that Benjamin left. Leaving the Demon Baron alone.

Tal'ka Noose thought to himself for a moment. He ruled the city for decades and had gained a level of power that risked catching the irk of national powers. All of it was worthless to him. Just rocks stacked to the sky and more strength than he needed. He rose and went to the door the boy was at earlier and opened it. On the other side was a space that seemed as if it could be in a suburban home. Entering he looked around the home. Around a corner appear a woman.

Susan Priest stopped in her tracks. Frozen like a deer that caught a hint of a predator. She carried a one-year-old baby on her hip, "Ka. Is something wrong?"

Tal'ka walked up to Susan and their second son. Ambrose, they named him. Tal'ka put a hand over the babe's head. He was so small. Just like Adrian use to be. Just every being used to be. Even the stoppable monsters that ruled the underworld like himself. Tal'ka closed his eyes and turned his smile into a hateful scowl and looked Susan right in the eyes. "Leave."

"What?" Susan was shocked. "What do you mean?"

"I mean leave. You and your spawn are not welcome here, or anywhere else in my domain. You have until the last light of dawn. Take where ever you wish. Anything you leave behind will be destroyed." Baron Noose turned and walked away.

"Ka, you can't-"

"I can. And the fact I just did is evidence to that. Sundown. Or else." Baron Noose walked back into his office and closed the door behind him. With a wave he sealed the door shut and returned to his desk. He pushed a button and spoke, "Deacon."

In an instant, the suited man that had guided Benjamin was before the desk, "My lord."

"Deacon, be sure Susan and the boys are out of the city limit by dusk and a moment later." Deacon acknowledged the order and just as quickly was gone.

The Demon Baron Tal'ka Noose turned in his chair and looked over his city, and it was his city. He had worked to gain every square foot under his control and made sure no one would challenge him. The sun was just nearing the peak of its summer journey across the sky. He knew fairies were the sort to time thing in line with the important parts of the day. They made their demand official at the strike of dusk, and by then there would be nothing in the city of any value to The Demon Baron Tal'ka Noose.
