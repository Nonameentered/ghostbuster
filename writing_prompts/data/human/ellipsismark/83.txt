"Curse." The dry rasp seem to come from nowhere.

"Pardon?" I said looking around my empty condo. "Is someone there? Jerry?" 

No one replied so I return to wash the few artifacts I had yet to donate. The majority was long gone and around the world. Many sent in exchange for wealth to the native who lived in the area around the old temple. I was washing a strange mirror that was either mundane or still a mystery. The reflect was in a black stone that seem to only reflect living reflects, but further testing was needed. Thus the washing. I lifted the mirror and looked into it.

"Curse." Came another dry rasp.

I turned around, "Alright, I know you're there. Reveal yourself now."

The spirit started to turn shape. It's form was that of dried husk of flesh in human shape. Its eye sockets were empty. "Curse thee. Return my trophies, or be Ow!"

I swatted the ghost with a broom, "No. Go away. Go to the dead place."

"Was in dead place. Hall of Kings. Til you stole ow!" I swatted again.

"Go." I kept swatting at the ghost, "Be gone."

"Mine. All mine. Return or curse." The ghost between swats.

"What? No." I stopped and looked at the ghost, "Even if I could I wouldn't do that, and if I would I couldn't. The artifacts are already being shipped around the world to stored or used to the fullest potential."

"But... mine." The ghost rasped again.

"Dude, no. You're dead. You don't need this stuff in the land of the dead. Regardless of what you think." I explained, "Your stuff is being used to help people too. There's one item that can turn ocean water into pure fresh water. It's being used to relieve a drought in Asia right now."

"But," ghost seemed to be confused and even some what sad, "Mine."

"Dude, come on. You were a king right? So as a king are you going to subjugate millions to suffer just so can have a neat after life?"

The ghost thought for a moment, "Millions? What is millions?"

"A million is one thousand thousand. Imagine you have a thousand stacks of coins each stack having a thousand coins. Now imagine many of these hordes and that each coin is one person. That is how many people are being helped by just one artifact. Are you still wanting me to return it."

The ghost thought for another moment, "Many subjects had I. Not million. Million is many." He hovered for a minute. Long enough I wondered if he was still mentally there before he pointed behind me, "Return mirror. Please."

"That thing?" I also pointed, "What is it?"

"Door way to other side. Need it to return to Hall of Kings." The ghost explained in a matter of fact way.

I picked up the mirror and looked it over, "Can you return there from here? Or do I need to physically align to the hall in the living world."

"Align it, or great journey in land of dead."

I thought about it, "Well why not stay here?"

"What?" The rasp was filled with surprised.

"Stay here. I mean there can't be much for you back home since I emptied it. So why not make a new after home here? I certainly don't want you to be lonely in that temple."

The ghost continued to stare before it started to look around. My home was fairly modern with all the modern standards. Big tv and media devices, full kitchen, and wore furniture to clash with the million dollar view outside.

"Okay." The ghost rasped.

"Cool. Say, what's your name?"

"King."

"King what?"

"King." was all he rasped.

"Okay then King. My name is Johnson. Professor Johnson to my students."
