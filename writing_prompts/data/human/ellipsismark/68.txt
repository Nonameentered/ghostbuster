Author's note: Oh fuck that was terrible. I fumbled that down a flight of stairs. I knew where I wanted to go, but had no idea how to get there. I eventually just went from A to B and called it done.

Well the good new is that I think I was able to make another character for a core book. Louis Paris, son of Aphrodite. 20 of 28 done, I'll have to see. But please, just try to forget about this one. Please? For me? I'll give you an autograph if I ever meetcha.

Addition: Sofia Erebus is the conception of a moral mother and an eldritch horror made the concept of darkness. Kinda metal.
