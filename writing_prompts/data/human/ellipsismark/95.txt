Author's note:

Well I don't think that was very good. I mostly forced myself to write this. Just so yall know it is apart of my OC world. The characters are nameless, but the world has an alternative history. I had no idea where I was trying to go and I really tried to force an ending to happen. 4/10 from myself, to myself.
