"I can't believe this!" Heavy Loader stomped around the living room. He pulled off the mask becoming Nathan Thymelocke, "This is unbelievable."

"Well, you have ten minutes to convert dad." Mira Thymelocke flicked mascara on her lashes, "Because he's going to be here soon."

"He's a criminal!" Nathan yelled.

"Sweety," Diana Thymelocke stood up from the couch, "He's just boy. Give him a chance."

"I will. I'll make sure he has the best public lawyer at his trial." Nathen yelled in response.

"Sweet Mercy Dad." Mira finished her makeup, "You should be happy I'm dating a fellow mutant. I could be knocking boots with that demon boy in my class."

"You shouldn't be knocking with anyone!" Nathan boomed, "Especially a criminal."

"Oh, Sweet Mercy! He's not a criminal Dad!" Mira yelled back.

"Yet!" Nathan started into another rant but was cut off by the door bell.

"Sugar Bear!" Mira squealed and leaped to the door opening it and revealing a teenage boy.

"Evening Mint Bunny." The boy leaned over to kiss Mira's cheek. "I got lost, so I followed the shouting."

"Speaking us." Mira pulled him in, "Mom, Dad, this is Enoch Feudnord. Sugar Bear, my parents."

"Hello, I'm Diana." Mira's mother came up with a handshake. "The man storming off is my husband Nathan."

Nathan was indeed storming off up the stairs, grumbling the whole way. Enoch just shrugged, "Shame. I'm a big fan of Heavy Loader. He's done so much for us mutants."

"Oh, he'll warm up. If you let him that is." Diana laughed at her own joke before pulling the boy in close and nearly whispering, "Listen punk, I am giving you a chance, but if you break my baby's heart, my husband won't come after you. I will, and I will break you. Understand?"

Enoch saluted with his free hand, "Ma'am, yes ma'am."

"Mama!" Mira whined, "Please don't threaten my boyfriend on our first real date!"

"Of course." Diana's sweet attitude returned in full, "Now you have every you need, right? Spare cash? Phonefare? Bus pass?"

"Yes. Yes. Yes." Mira checked off as she and Enoch headed to the door.

"Condoms?" Diana added.

"Mom!" Mira blushed through her light makeup.

"I don't want to be grandmother until I'm forty-three young lady. Understand?"

"Yes, Mama. I'll see you tonight." Mira shut the door behind them.

The two teenagers walked along the street. They had planned a dinner and movie, with a possible stop by the arcade to win some plushies. Mira liked stuffed animals, and Enoch liked winning them. All and all it was a plan for a great night. Enoch leaned over to Mira, "So... you got rubbers on you?"

Mira laughed, "Don't get your hopes up boyo. I don't put out until the third date."

"A woman of class. Well, I hope I manage to fake my suave persona until then." Enoch ran his fingers through his hair.

"Suave? That's what you're going for?" Mira tensed, "I thought you were trying for pitiable beyond believe."

"If that works for you, I'll take it." Enoch wrapped his arm around her and pulled her closer. "So long as I get to be with you."

Mira blushed, "Oh stop it."

"Can't do that. I'm too head-over-heel for you." Enoch pulled her closer as they stopped at a crosswalk.

"Enoch, you're too much." Mira's face was growing brighter in her hands.

"Nah, babe. You're too much," Enoch tighten his grip as he lended over to kiss Mira, "but I promise you, on every star in the sky, I'll become man enough for you."

"Enoch please," Mira was at her limit. She shoved out a hand without gauging her strength. Enoch's body launched into the air and landed in a trash pile. Luckily the trash was hard cans and paper, and not something like rotting food. Mira cried out, "Are you okay Sugar Bear."

"Aces." Enoch stood up and made his way back, "I've taken hits much harder than that. Your lovetaps are softened by your sweetness."

Mira blushed again, "Okay, maybe you are suave."

They shared a kiss. It wasn't their first. Their first kiss had been passionate affair days ago at school. They had been fighting and flirting for months before then and when they finally tied the knot their classmates were rather annoyed that they had thrown the game, but when love blossoms everything falls into awe. Even a battlefield. They didn't care then, and they didn't care if their parents disagreed. They wanted to be together, and not even the winds of fate would have a say in their relationship. They swore this on every star in the sky and all the seas under them.

Soon they entered the city's urban limit where the building grew into towers. The streets were lit by lamp lights and storefronts along the way. Hand in hand they strolled down the street until they were cut off. Two large men stepped out of an alley. Before Enoch or Mira could react one of them called out, "Hey yo, it's little Enoch and his broad. Having a date night and whatnot?"

"Oh no." Enoch stopped and looked behind him. Two more goons were coming from behind. Scanning the street he recognized more goons among the passerbys. "This is bad."

"Enoch, my nephew, no, my brother, it ain't like that." The first goon said with raised hands, "We just want a chat."

"Is that so?" Enoch said. Fog came out of his as he gathered his power within him.

"I don't believe them one bit." Mira stepped up cracking her knuckles, "Let's show them whatfor."

"Alright alright, you got me." The goons backedoff, "We don't want to talk. Just her."

He pointed down the ally where a figure stood in the shadow. Enoch scowled, "Well, I guess this had to happen at some point. Come on Mira. Let me introduce you to my mom."

They walked down the ally to the figure. Enoch's mother was well known. A supervillain in her own right. She was dressed in plain clothes instead of the dark blue dress that marked her as Queen. Mira kept her nerve walking up for a handshake, "Hello. Mira. Mira Thymelocke."

"I know," Queen said without moving. "I am very aware of you, and how you managed to seduce my son."

Enoch shouted in protest, "She did not-"

"Quiet Boy!" Queen snapped her eyes to him, freezing him in place, "Your mother is talking. Now, what exactly is your plan? Little girl."

"Dinner and a show." Mira said without missing a beat, "But it seems like the show is coming first."

"Are you threatening me?" Queen narrowed her eyes at Mira.

"Are you threatening me?" Mira said lifting a fist, "Because I don't take threats well. Ask your son."

The air grew colder. Everyone's breath puffed out fog. Everyone except Queen and Enoch. "If you think you can stand against me, I welcome you to try."

"Oh, we accept!" Enoch stepped up summoning ice around his hand, "Just you and us."

"You would raise a hand against your own mother?" Queen asked with distrain.

"You bet I would. You wouldn't respect me if I didn't." Enoch took a stance ready to fight.

"And I doubt you can handle both of us. Not here at least." Mira gestured to the street full of people, "So bring it if you want."

Queen sneered, "Fine. I'll let you be. For now."

With a snap of her fingers, the goons parted and she turned to walk away. Enoch sighed with relief and Mira hugged him. She chuckled, "You think I made a good impression?"

"I think so actually." Enoch hugged her back, "But I don't really care."

As they exited the ally a good grabbed Enoch's head and noogied him, "Little brother Enoch. Gonna be a man soon at this rate."

"Get off me." Enoch pushed him away, "We're going to be late."

Mira took Enoch's arm, "Yeah, and just so you know, he's already a man to me."

The goons hoot-n-hollered as they walked on. They didn't care. Let others think and say whatever. They were going to stand together. Through everything and anything. They had sworn to both the stars and sea after all.
