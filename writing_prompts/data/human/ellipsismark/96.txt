"There's no such thing as a war hero."  
\-General Patrick, US Army

The International Conflict was fought around the world over dozens of individual wars. The one I fought in was between the British and Chinese. I was an American from New York sent out to fight the Chinese as an ally to England. This was before the peace between US and Russia broke, but that doesn't now. Not here. Not at this stone slab covered in names I either don't remember or never learned in the middle of Nowhereistan. Not with him standing.

He was clearly old enough to have been in the fighting and was clearly Chinese from his face as well as his clothing. "Hello." was all he said. He looked over the stone. I think he looking for a name. Didn't know. Couldn't tell. I was acting the same as him, but I didn't know anyone.

"Who did you fight for?" He asked me looking over name as he adjusted his glasses. His body was fragile like my own. Healthy living and good genes get beat time eventually.

"What it matter? Too old to fight anyone now." I said not answering.

He sighed "American then. I can tell by your speaking." He grinned, "That's good. Because if you were British I would have to beat you to death."

"Oh, you got some kong gu mu shin skill up your sleeve?" I chuckled

"I have strong cane." He said holding a solid oak stick. "And also gun." He said showing a peashooter in his vest robe thing. "You packing?"

"Airport took them. Said they'll return them on my return."

"Bastards. Taking a hero war's weapon."

I was turned cold by that. "There's no such as a war hero. You're either defending a home or you're a bad guy."

"General Patrick. Tenth memorial peace day. I remember hearing that over radio. Family didn't like that. Thought it insulted my honor. Thought they should worry they own honor. But Chinese proud of family like that." 

I looked over the names for once. The stone was made years after all the fighting was done, and I forget by who, but on it was 107 American name, 53 British, and well over three thousand Chinese in they own writing. 

"The were cowards that day." The Chinese man said, "Couldn't accept a lose. So they firebomb whole mountain. Destroy entire villages around area. Damn England." He started ranting in Chinese i think after that. Couldn't tell.

"I was in second reinforcement wave." he continued, "We was coming up to the mountain and were just at the base when the bombs started. Thought hell was coming up out the ground before I planes. Damn British were importing hell from the sky. Screams came from mountain. Mostly soldiers, not all though. Still dream about it." He just stared at the rock that meant nothing. There were rocks, metal sheets, and entire books with names couldn't save a single life around the world. Yet they are made.

I had enough and designed to leave. As I turned the Chinese man asked, "How did you survive it?"

"First wave retreat. Was scared too you know. Chinese are tough bastards."

"Ha. Yes, Must be to scare an American. Hear you all fight like demons."

I thought about that, "You know, while the British were the ones who did the bomb, is was an American who called it in."

"How you know that?"

"Just do."
