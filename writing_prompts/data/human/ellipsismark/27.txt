Quickie:

"Well I didn't mean to. The drunk bastard was threatening to curse my daughter, which was strange since my wife gave me seven boys, but I was still right scared. So i threw my pitchfork at em and it got em it neck. You gotta believe me Shieff, you gotta."

"Calm down Farmer Haymen. I believe you. The detective mages confirmed that the poor soul was drunker than morning piss. You'll have to host a dinner for his family as an apologize. Magic law and all, but you wouldn't be changed with a crime. Have a good."

And so The Haymen Family made a grand feast. In total the drunk mage had two brothers, a cousin, and their grandmother showup. All of them were sad about the death of their kin, but held no ill will to the farmers since they all knew that he was, in fact, a drunk bastard.
