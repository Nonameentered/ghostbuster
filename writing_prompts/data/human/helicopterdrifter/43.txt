##Guardian Toys

Upon hearing the glass break, the homeowner is startled awake. He quickly grabs his trusty Golf Club of Confidence, then opens his bedroom door. He knows every creaking board in his home, so it's of no consequence to make his way down the hall. His back presses against the wall, then he peers around a corner into his living room.

Three intruders are looking around with flashlights as one of them reaches to turn on a table lamp. The sudden light startles one of the other intruders and he spins on the lamp with a gun raised. The sudden movement causes the first intruder to knock over the lamp which then shines a rounded light on the opposite wall as it leaves the top of the lamp shade.

"Idiot," chides the scared leader in a hushed whisper. "Leave the lights alone."

After seeing the gun, the homeowner looks back at his Golf Club of Inadequacy and moves to hide in the storage space beneath the stairs. As he's pulling the door closed, he hears his daughter laugh in the next room. "Aubrey," he whispers to himself.

"What was that?" the leader asks. "Go check it out."

A flashlight wielder walks past the stairs to scout the dining room on the other side. There he finds a little girl with short dark hair, pulling a red wagon as a carriage for her stuffed animals--a brown bear and an alternating, green-striped snake.

The little girl squints into the flashlight as the scout looks back to report. "It's just some kid." He turns back to find the girl and snake gone but the bear is now wearing a black body suit and is climbing out of the wagon. The flashlight holder freezes, his eyes growing wide within the narrow slit of his ski mask.

"Keep her quiet," calls the leader from the living room.

"Bu--but..." the scout starts, frozen and staring. The bear's face is distorted by shadows that form wicked eyes and a crooked smile. The bear is leaning on the wagon's tire, then winks and pats wheel.

The backend of the wagon pitches up as huge tires form. The front tires grow as well but maintains a downward slant from back to front. The red becomes concealed by black as only the words Radio Flyer remains to identify the former wagon. Several cylinders rise up from the back like the pipes on an organ, but then slant backwards and begin to vibrate as smoke rolls out of them.

The scout screams, turning to run as the wagon barrels forward. It hits him below the knee of his hind leg and causes him to fall forward, slamming his head into a wall.

The homeowner quickly pulls the storage door back shut as the wagon comes to rest on top of the scout. The other two intruders round the corner to see a red wagon sitting on top of their unconscious partner.

"What the hell?" the gun wielding leader asks, looking over the wagon. He turns to his partner and gives him a head gesture to go check out the dining room.

The partner bypasses the stairs and shines his flashlight into the dining room to find a bear standing with his arms crossed while tapping his foot. The partner's light begins to shake as he pulls out a knife. The bear's distorted expression grows larger, and its eyes start to dance as if they were the shadow of a fire. Its bodysuit begins expanding, making the bear larger. The exposed head remains the same size, but the body quickly ascends until the small head is looking down from over six-feet of height.

"What is it?" the leader calls over, not being able to see and only watching as his partners head continues to track something as it moves upward.

The bear runs forward as the partner starts to backpedal with his knife out. The outside of the bear's arm is swung out and upward, striking the intruder and sending him sailing back into the living room as the leader quickly steps out of the way.

The leader's sleeve is tugged on from the opposite side, and he spins with the side of the gun, catching the little girl across the face and causing her to tumble away. The stuffed snake is knocked from her grip and falls into the round spotlight shining across the floor and onto the wall. The leader is looking at the girl's prone form, flashlight in one hand and gun in the other.

He notices movement and quickly turns to the spotlight on the wall. The snake's shadow just raised its head and turns to look towards the leader. A tongue flicks out of the shadow's mouth as the leader looks back and forth between the stuffed toy and the shadow.

His eyes go wide as the shadow grows and spreads over the ceiling. "Stay back," he yells, firing two shots into the opposite wall. The shadow becomes a separate form and continues to move closer while looking down at him. The leader squeals as he fires more rounds through the figure and into the ceiling as a gaping mouth opens and bites down on his upper body. His disembodied kicking legs raise into the air as the snake turns its head upward, then they disappear as well.

The dazed homeowner is leaning against the door of a police car with a blanket over his shoulders. The red and blue strobes are passing over the scene of emergency personnel coming and going from the residence. The man is staring at his daughter as she sits in the back of the ambulance, continuing to be checked over by the medics. She's giggling as her bear is held in a headlock under her arm.

"Ugh, sir," says a police officer with an open notebook.

The homeowner turns back to him, having forgotten he was there. "I'm sorry, what?"

"You said there were three intruders, but we only found the two. Are you certain there was another present?"

The homeowner shakes his head. "I really don't know," he says waggling his fingers towards his temple. "It's all a bit fuzzy. Maybe it was just the two of them."

"Do you know which one of them was firing the gun or why they were shooting into the ceiling?"

The homeowner grows distant again as the police officer continues to ask questions without answers.
