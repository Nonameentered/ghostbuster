"You know how golems are, Tammy," Linda begins, "they do exactly what you tell them and to the best of their ability."

"Relax," Tammy replies. "I just sent him up the road to get my delicates from the laundromat. He'll be back in a jiffy, just wait 'n see."

"But what if it does something terribly unexpected in the process? It could grab the wrong laundry, mistakenly draw Excalibur, or even step on the mail man!"

Suddenly, the front door swings open and a 6 ft golem walks in with a wicker basket. Tammy walks over, sifts through the basket, then turns back. "Drats. Looks like it managed to get the proper clothes and the past 25 minutes must not have been enough time to make the 8,400 mile round trip to England.

Tammy pauses, then leans back to look at the golem's feet, finding a dark discoloration compared to the monotone gray stone that makes up the rest of its body. She moves her head from side to side as if weighing something once she sees the unopened envelope stuck to the bottom of its foot. "I suppose the jury's still out on the mailman. Best we lay low for the next few days. You up for takeout?"

Linda's panicked expression shifts from worry into glee as she claps and nods vigorously.

"Alright," Tammy says, turning back to the golem. "Now run up to that Asian spot and grab us something to eat. You know the one."

The golem trots off, slamming the door to dislodge a picture from the wall.

"Tammy!" Linda exclaims. 

"What?" she replies. "It's not like it'll step on the mailman again."
