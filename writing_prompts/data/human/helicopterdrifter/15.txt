Oh yeah, I've been trying to do more fun, lighthearted, wholesome and humorous pieces because all of October was nothing but horror type writing. Several of my November things have been Dream or Dreaming related.

As for the Hypnos thing, that will be up to you. I didn't correlate any other gods and viewed Hymnessa as someone that was written out of her own story by means of historians omitting her. If she were actually the final sibling and Zeus took credit for what she was responsible for, maybe hypnos was a god that was written into the narrative to overlap the vacancy that Hymnessa would have left behind?

If you think about a seashell being pulled out of the sand on the beach, just because the shell is gone, doesn't mean you won't be able to tell it was there at some point. Maybe something similar to this happened with Hymnessa and the actually "history" was somewhat embellished and twisted to cover the empty space she left behind.

With her statue and presence, she's giving a firsthand account but there's two things that should be considered: 1) is she remembering correctly and 2) does Hymnessa actually exist?

If you notice Kyle's closing thoughts, this conversation **undermined** his previous beliefs and Hymnessa claims that Hades has a personality that **undermines**. It could also be twisted around with this just being a case of Hades plotting something by creating a false narrative.

I considered the Hades route but again, I was burned out on October stories lol So ultimately, you can take it whichever way you think best. It would be your story, not mine.  üòÅ
