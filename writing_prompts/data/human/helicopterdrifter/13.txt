**Magical Theory**

*Old school, actual chalk and actual chalk board*, you think. *Wow, this guy is really into the classics.* The room's amphitheater seating is well lit, and you sit somewhere in the middle as each end curves back around to the instructor. You didn't want to seem too eager by sitting up front, but you didn't want to sit in the back and seem like a layabout either.

When the lecture begins and the *Mr. Langley* starts into his introduction on magic theory, your eyes immediately glaze over, and you even elicit a few nearby chuckles when you feign falling asleep.

*Come on guy, we're tenth years. While most of the expectant mothers of the magic-void children were getting Mozart, we were getting magic theory. This stuff isn't news to any of us.*

Fortunately, the classic loving instructor doesn't check to see if any of his illustrious magic pupils are still breathing, much less following along with his lesson. *Maybe he knows it sucks and is just trying to get through it? Gotta love the old 'checking the box' lesson plans.*

You shake your head. *Whatever.* And bend down to access your completely non-magical bookbag. You gain access to retrieve your headphones; the same ones that have ear cups so large that they obscure your peripheral vision. But it's fine. It's not like you're walking alongside traffic and from the way this is going, the less you can see, the better.

Your bag might not be magical, but these headphones sure make up for that. As they encroach on your vision, you checkout of class. The headphones seem like nearby walls and a lot of times you picture yourself in a recording booth. 

You get carried away while listening to your song of choice. The chorus comes back around, and you open your mouth to sing within your recording booth but suddenly stop, opening your eyes and remembering that you're still in the middle of lecture.

While you stare at the back of the professor's black vest and see his chalk wielding hand move furiously across the board, you imagine hearing the tic, tic, tic the chalk is making each time it's moved away and then set back against the board as he continues writing.

You lift your index finger into the air while swaying to your song. You trace out the shape of a flame and when you lift your finger away from the "air board", the flame starts to flicker. *Fire, water, earth,* you think as you trace out each of the magical elements and they gain motion.

A cute blond is sitting one row down from you, but the curved seating allows her to see your hand gestures and turn her attention your way without much effort. She looks to you with a slight smile and a curious expression.

No one else can see your air drawings of course, but that doesn't stop you from doing them. Your eyes flick over to her, and you return a smile but continue your doodle.

With the fire, water, and earth elements all drawn and now animated, you roll out your upright palm as if presenting them as a present. *Wind*, you think as you blow across the top of your palm and send the three elemental drawings towards the girl as if you were blowing her a kiss.

She blushes and shakes her head before looking back to the chalk board. The elements might not have been visible for her but that doesn't stop her from recognizing the symbolic kiss that was sent her way.

But such is the power of dreams. No one else can see them but they're just as magical. One day, your power will be strong enough for others to interact with. Until then, let the others play with their party favors, because your magic is in playing the long game.
