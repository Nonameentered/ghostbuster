Awesome! I hope you find some others that you like. Here's yesterday's that I think you might like because it's a positive story.

There was another writing prompt that I really liked, which I actually turned into a series. The prompt was about Little Red Riding Hood and the undead. My version became a violent, action story but it's been a really fun story so far. I already have a plan for the plot and how it will end. It's going to be a very dramatic story. You may see that prompt on my profile but know that particular scene became the second scene of the story. I wrote another one before it that makes the story feel more established!

Anywho, happy reading!
