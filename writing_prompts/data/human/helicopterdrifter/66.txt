Not-Steve's Close Encounter


The human ascends through a round opening in the floor,  his arms and legs apart and shifting as he attempts to balance on some invisible mechanism. 

The opening closes, allowing the human to step down into the floor. He looks around to find a control room filled with busy bodies. They all seemed to have important work and continued on with their tasks while not sparring a glance for the dumbfounded human.

"Hello Steve," comes a voice from over his shoulder.

The human turns back to the alien and shakes his head. "It's Dave. Steve's my twin brother."

The alien's head looks like an upside-down egg with human-like facial features that all sit towards the bottom of its head. It looks at the human, perplexed.

"I always knew you guys were real," says Not-Steve. 

The alien watches as Not-Steve looks around the control room with glee. 

"Steve," the alien repeates.

"Nope. Like I said, that's my brother."

"Do you realize you're standing in an alien spaceship and surrounded by aliens?"

"Yeah. I always knew you were real though."

"Well do you think it's possible that we have more sophisticated technology than you?"

"Absolutely! You guys are light-years ahead of us. I just hope we never end up on opposite sides."

"Quite. Well could you also believe that speaking may not be our primary means of communication?" It gestures to its enlarged head. "And that it would be reasonable to assume that telepathy was possible for us, allowing us to see into the mind of others to glimpse their true name?"

Not-Steve turns his palms up and gestures around the room. "Well of course! Just look at all this stuff in here?"

"Well, if you can accept all of that, why is it so hard for you to understand that your parents named you and then got you mixed up before properly labeling you,  Steve?"

"Nope. I told you already. I'm Dave."

"Alright, now you're just being a Richard."

"Nope--" Not-Steve's eyes narrow. "Hey...I see what you did there."

The faerie is shaking its fist at the space craft as the ship hovers in the sky. A light begins shinning on the ground next to the faerie and moments later, a human lands on the ground in a heap. The faerie looks back up, confused, then sees one of the aliens looking down through the opening. 

"He's all yours faerie!" Calls the voice. The door closes and the ship flies away.
