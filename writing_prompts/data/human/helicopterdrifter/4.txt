Chad walked into the house that he didn't have time to appreciate and threw his cache case onto the bed that he never got to sleep in. He noticed the intricate pattern applied to the double doors of his closet and he immediately drew out the pistol that was holstered in the shoulder harness beneath his gray work jacket.

Chad moved through the house, checked corners and hiding spaces as he cleared each room in turn. He was no stranger to *conflict resolution*. When he initially signed up with his freelance mercenary company, it was supposed to be a boring day job of varying local security details. Unfortunately, it was quickly determined that his skillset was overqualified for his station; his day job started involving nights and his local security bit started involving international travel.

Chad went through his home security feeds and checked the backlog for the alarm system. Nothing seemed out of order or gave an indication that someone had broken into his house while he was away on *business*. After reaching a dead-end, he turned to online searches and looked for break-ins that involved graffiti.

'The Puzzle Magus strikes again,' Chad read. Apparently, something like the Jigsaw killer had emerged, but magic was involved instead of the machinations of a guy that spent entirely too much time staring at a Lowe's catalogue. *Improving Home Improvement*, he thought as he read the reference to Jigsaw. 

This new Magus dirtbag seemed to use magical traps with hidden instructions. They were applied to a person's possessions so even when a different person tried to trigger the trap, the effects still applied to the owner of whatever had been tagged.

Chad closed his laptop and went back to his bedroom. He approached and looked over the intricate pattern on his doors. At first, it didn't look like anything more than intermixing colors of green, red, and yellow, but it gave him the sense of those old optical illusion photos that had hidden 3D images.

Chad adjusted his vision, and sure enough, there it was. 'If you open this door, you will die.' From what he read online, it really didn't matter if he opened it or not. If this door gets opened, he dies. It didn't matter who did it or when.

*It doesn't say when or how,* he thinks. *I'm going to die at some point, so if I open it, then die when I'm eighty, that doesn't make it wrong. So what would be the point? If he's some sort of Jigsaw copycat, there would have to be a point...is the point magical in nature? What if the door never gets opened?"*

Chad immediately retrieved an industrial strength adhesive he kept for *work purposes* and applied a coat around the doorknobs so that they couldn't be turned. He screwed boards into place that overlapped the door's frame. A roundtrip to the local home improvement store followed, then he donned goggles and hearing protection before applying further methods of keeping the door closed.

Chad stepped away from the amalgamation of chains, fastened wood, locking bars and welding beads to give a satisfied nod of approval. Next, he broke open the wall and pried the door's frame out of the wall. It finally broke free, and he lifted it and turned, moving it out of the way. Air compression cylinders began firring behind him in rapid succession as high-powered nail guns sent metallic projectiles into his back and peppered the area around him.

Chad looked down at the door in his possession, the red of his anatomy having created a splash art across the white of the door. His profession had instilled an ever-present sense of calm so even as he stared at his body painting and the prickly door that was riddled with the metallic nail-projectiles that had just passed through his body, he didn't panic.

Chad's shadow was cast onto the door, and he clearly saw that it was full of holes from the attack. But shock and death hadn't followed so he calmly looked over his seal. The door hadn't moved from within its frame and soon he watched as the gaps in his shadow shrunk, then disappeared.

Chad further sealed the backside of the door, then rented a backhoe and cement mixer before encasing the door within a cement tomb and building a shop on the new foundation.

From then on, Chad became an actual Chad. He strolled into the middle of his indoor business meeting, jacket open, sunglasses on, and a shotgun draped over his shoulder. His company's competitor didn't seem too thrilled about the hostile takeover. A series of personnel with black jackets readied the submachine guns that were dangled from shoulder straps beneath their business attire.

Chad looked around. "Well, ladies and gentlemen," he said, "it seems I'm all out of bubble gum, so we know what that means." His shotgun comes off his shoulder, he actions the pump, then starts in on the day's agenda.
