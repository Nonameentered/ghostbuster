Nothing is Forever

A substance like mercury drifts through humanity's solar system. It collides with various forms of space debris and its contact acts something like a hot instrument through butter. Everything is peeled away as it's consumed, causing it to grow and sending a sheen shifting across its reflective surface. The contact causes no friction with the substance and doesn't alter its course or speed.

As it passes Saturn and Jupiter, it passes through several moons, growing drastically and taking an elongated shape. It then collides with the debris of a human satellite, consuming it and incorporating it into its ever-shifting nature.

A ripple reverberates through the substance like a stone hitting water. Its intent begins reaching through various wave forms as it searches for more to consume. It eventually comes in contact with sound waves and shifts along the spectrum as various sounds sync with the ripples shifting across its form. It stops on a particular song and the ripples grow still. Words and concepts stream across the soundwaves and suddenly the evolving creature taps into the internet to absorb context for the playing song.

Encountering a squid reference online, its shape mimics a squid as its appendages start to squirm in sync with the song's tune. A green sheen starts to shift up and down the creature's body and it begins to waggle as if it were doing The Worm through space.

"All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right,all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right."

The squid mimic becomes more animated, popping and locking to the song as it sails towards Earth. It lifts its appendages towards its head and waves them while continuing to sway.

"Shake it, Sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it."

The squid's body develops swaying shoulders, then four sets of eyes, each having a multi-faceted nature like a fly. The song's video begins playing on all of the reflective surfaces as the band plays and dances on stage. Suspenders then start forming over its shoulders, its appendages merge and become a pair of legs with a flannel pattern.

The head shifts again and its proportions change as its head becomes an appropriate size to its body. The head takes on a humanoid shape, having eyes, ears, nose and facial features that shift to mimic the lead singer. Its torso adopts a solid green color as its human form finishes, and it nods vigorously to the beat.

The song's chorus is coming up and it loses control, getting pumped to join in. It opens its mouth--then dies.
