I've only been doing WPs for about two weeks, but I have several little stories that I found enjoyable to write. I'm not sure if you're looking for certain kinds of stories to read or what but I wouldn't worry too much about people not writing on your post. There are many things here that people just don't see. I've posted a lot of stories already but very few see them. It's just the nature of the sheer volume of WPs that get posted.

If you are just wanting to find stories that match your tastes, there may be others that you'll enjoy within my WP history. Feel free to look through my profile comments to see if anything catches your eye. I wrote one with a doom reference and some playground bullies over the weekend which I thought was pretty fun. Here's that one:

There are a few more stories with deities/superpowers too. If you are looking for something specific, just let me know and I can shoot you a links for any of them I think might be what you're trying to find!
