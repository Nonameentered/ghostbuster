You are a waterboy. The midday sun is blazing with no cloud or reprieve in sight. The offensive and defensive coordinators stand out among the football players giving guidance as their team continues to practice on a day of record breaking heat.


The sides reset, then start another play. The quarterback pump-fakes to a receiver and then hands it off to the running back.


The runner drives into the back of the offensive line as the hole didn't open as it should've. He keeps driving with both sides pushing back and forth until he is brought down. 


A whistle blows and the running back is walking back to the huddle with his hands on his hips. He then reaches up, unsnaps his helmet, and takes a knee in place while leaning on his helmet. When prompted the running back says he's feeling dizzy so they call for water. 


You hear them call, so you snatch up the bottle carrier and hustle over. You see the team huddled around Markus, the running back, who's also a bully that's constantly messing up your hair or knocking your books out of your hands. 


He sees you and extends a beckoning hand. "Give it here, dweeb," he tells you. 


You open your mouth to reply when two poofs sound next to your ears as two mini-yous appear on each of your shoulders. One is in white with a halo and the other is in red with a pitchfork.


They both look down at the bully and then the white one leans forward to look around your face to your other shoulder. "Hey, Red, you can take this one," he says before looking back to you with a nod and a wink.


You look down to the you with the pitchfork. "Alright, he says to you. "I'm not here because you *want* me here, I'm here because you *need* me here."
