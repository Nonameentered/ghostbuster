*Oh gosh,* Aubrey thinks. *Is this what DMV lines are going to be like?* Ahead of her are eight rows of fifteen-year-olds that look like they are trying to get through an airport security checkpoint. There are metal detector type archways that each has to walk through, beyond which is a desk and a representative to record and report results.

*This is new to me*, Shades replies in her mind. *But your people are always coming up with new ways to inhibit yourselves."

The line is moving painfully slow. Aubrey keeps scratching at her neck and rubbing her eyebrow.

*You're going to rub that thing off, if you keep playing with it.*

*I can't help it. What if I get something bad like a kitty litter replacement specialist or a gum scrapper and have to clean under desks? Do you have any idea how much gum that's gotten there by me alone?*

*Oh, I have some inclination of your bubbilicious tendencies.*

The lights begin to flicker and dim, one of the representatives standing to tap on their desk lamp as it dims, whines and almost seems to wink out like a dying candle.

*But, I can't do those things, Shades. That's what I'd be stuck with forever.*

*Uh, Aubrey, I think it's best you calm down.*

*And then there's everyone's sweaty jerseys from practice. They could say that I have to wash all of them, always, all the time even.*  Aubrey begins to wring the sleeves of her black hoodie, pushing and pulling as she kneads her hands. *They could have me emptying all the ash trays. You know how sensitive I am to that smell. Or what about the trash, there could be spit bottles inside it or cans! What if they're open and it spills on me?*

The whining lights intensify, and a bulb explodes on one of the desks, startling the personnel, other kids, and snapping Aubrey out of her stupor. Aubrey's eyes grow wide, and she begins looking around as the other kids start to murmur around her.

*You need to settle down, Aubs. You're about to cause all the lights to go out.*

Aubrey gets to her archway as two representatives are standing at the desk. "Some sort of power surge or interference," one tells the other.

"Next," says the woman sitting at the desk beyond Aubrey's arch.

The other representative walks away as Aubrey steps through the device. She passes through as blue light sweeps over her. The representative inputs a few keyboard commands, then pauses, pushing her glasses back up her nose as she scrutinizes Aubrey. "That's new," she mumbles to no one in particular.

"Ev...erything alright?" Aubrey asks.

"Yeah, it's just my machine must be busted." She picks up a phone and calls for someone to bring out the alternate scanner. "Just hang on. We'll have that other scanner out here soon."

Aubrey starts to pull at her sleeves again and makes the mistake of looking behind her. She finds a lot of upset expressions behind her for causing a hold up. *Sorry*, she mimes to them.

Another representative comes out with something that looks like a radar gun for check highway speeds. He approaches Aubrey and holds the device up to her forehead like he's checking her temperature. The device emits two tones, low then high and the representative pulls the device away to look at its screen. "Huh," he says, confused.

He turns it around to show the lady behind the desk and she nods. "Yeah, that's what I got too."

*I'm not sure I like where this is going*, Shades says.

"Hey," Aubrey says, speaking up. "Let me have a look at that."

"Ok, but we're not really supposed to," the man replies. He spins the device around and points to the word 'god' on the screen.

*That's not good,* Shades says. *I didn't expect this device to detect me.*

Aubrey's face scrunches in confusion. "I'm not seeing what the problem is. It says that I'm an *advisor*, right?"

The man turns the screen back around and narrows his eyes. "Huh...I'm not really sure how I missed that before."

Aubrey walks behind the woman's desk as she raises an arm in protest. "No mam, authoriz--"

"It's alright," Aubrey tells her. "You asked me to double check what your result was, remember? So, let's see here. Where was it again?"

The woman points to the 'god' on her computer screen.

"Yeah, yours says the same thing. It says, *advisor*." Aubrey's finger traces under the word 'god' as she says 'advisor' slowly.

The woman squints at her screen and alternates looking at it with her bare eyes and through her glasses. "That is the darndest thing," the woman says. "I can see it now, but I'm not sure why it wasn't clear earlier."

"It's alright," Aubrey says, waving it off. "Happy I could help."

The woman prints off some paperwork as the man departs with the other scanner. She sets the papers down in front of Aubrey and points to some places to sign. "What kind of advisor do you think you'll be," the woman asks.

"I haven't decided yet. But maybe I can give some advice on these darn lines here."

The woman laughs. "You work me a pay raise into that, and you've got my vote." Aubrey smiles as she passes back the signed papers. "Thank you, sweetheart. Next," she yells, looking back towards the line of kids.

Aubrey takes her papers and then begins walking away faster than she would like to.

*Whistle noise,* Shade says.

Aubrey's face scrunches. *Did you really just say whistle noise?*

*Well, yeah. I felt like that deserved a whistle of appreciation, but you know...no lips here so...whistle noise.*

Aubrey shakes her head and smiles. *I can't believe that just worked.*

*Yep. The power of suggestion. One of my shadow powers. You really made it your own bath there though, Aubs. You weren't even the same person. You just acted and let the powers guide you. Imagine what you could do when you actually practice with them."

*Oh no. I'm still not doing that, but at least I don't have to go scrap off all my gum so yay!*
