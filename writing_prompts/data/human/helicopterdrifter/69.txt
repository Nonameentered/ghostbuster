Knowledge of animal mannerisms will go a long way! I previously had a Siberian Husky, and I got more involved in learning about pack animals. Wolves have a very interesting dynamic which I found fascinating, so I enjoyed learning more about them.

I'm currently writing a story that involves a wolf. While portraying him, I did not intend to focus so much on his expressions and mannerisms, but as a product of having my husky and looking into pack animals, my character took on a lot of expressions.

For example, my husky loved to hang his head out the window but would always sneeze as he stared into the wind. Similarly, when my character got put into a situation on top of a moving train, the character began sneezing repeatedly until he could bury his nose well enough to avoid the onslaught of air.

Whatever scenes this character finds himself in, various forms of expression fall into place on their own and it's all because of my previous experiences. So if you want to get a better feel for a particular animal, research them and watch their behavior. Pay attention to how they behave in various situations. A lot of great writing material can be obtained from them when they aren't paying attention to you.
