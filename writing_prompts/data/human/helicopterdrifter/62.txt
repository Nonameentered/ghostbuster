I was onboard with a story about mind research üòÅ But then you had to go and try to indoctrinate me with your collective subconscious. Really, Rainbow...I thought we were friends!

I liked your story. I think seeing the emotional colors is an interesting idea. When the scientist first starts seeing these colors, I wonder what that first experiencing of it was like. He's frustrated during the research and then notices his red glow. His noticing the red changes the color to confusion and then to alarm...or maybe to fascination/intrigue?

That's not an adjustment recommendation. I just think that moment sounds interesting.

I also liked how the story became the journal and then you ended with what you opened with. I think the most unsettling part about this is how it could be true!

Thanks for the story, Rainbow! I enjoyed it.
