"Wait, really? Are you sure? I'm seeing a lot of programming in here for managing contacts, appointments, and applications. Is that what spirit guides are for?"

"Ugh," the boy groans. "You're not very good at this stuff are you?"

"But wait, I can learn to be good! That's the point, right Dani5634@tmail.com?"

"Just call me Dani. Dani's fine."

"You got it, Dani's Fine. Your spirit guide will call you whatever you like!"

"No! My name is Dani. Call me Dani."

"Dani! I'm always ready to learn new things with you Dani!"

"Learn with me? Shouldn't you be teaching me stuff? Do you still not know what a spirit guide is?"

"A spirit guide is an entity that remains as a disparate spirit to act as a guide or protector to a living incarnated human being. Guess we both learned something huh Dani? Isn't learning great?"

"You're weird."

"You bet! I am now weird!"

"Wait, what?" Dani suddenly raises up from his bed, and drops his phone as it starts to vibrate. The screen becomes glitchy as a smiley face with Xs for eyes keeps flickering in and out. The overhead lighting beings flickering in sync with the screen as Dani continues to look around nervously. "Stop being weird! You're freaking me out!"

The lights become steady again and the phone's touch screen becomes normal. "Being weird with Dani is a lot of fun. Returning to Spirit Guide mode. Weird mode scheduled to resume in twenty eight minutes."

"Dang it. I think I gave the new learning interface a split personality. Better wipe my data and try again."
