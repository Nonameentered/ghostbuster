Hey Cirrus! I liked your story, and I particularly like this bit:

>The future had no place in the past, and magic enforced that.

It was also nice to see Alexandi have a bit of a redemption arc in the end.

There’s something that tripped me up in the story though. When I initially read this, I was assuming that this was in a classroom and that Punished-Alexandi was a 3rd perspective, separate from Nessie and Ms. Mage. After rereading, I realized that I pulled the classroom out of my rear and that Punished-Alexandi is in Ms. Mage. I think my issue was that I didn’t find a strong enough association between Punished-Alexandi and Ms. Mage.

Another issue that I saw was the inter-working between Alexandi’s redemption and this bit:

&#x200B;

>then, she’d awake in the past again, in another place

It leads me to believe that Punished-Alexandi keeps living through other people’s perspectives to experience what Alive-Alexandi inflicted on them. If that’s the case, then Punished-Alexandi wouldn’t have a motivation to help Nessie in the end. This could be rectified in a longer piece though, and maybe this was something that blossomed “off screen.” Maybe Punished-Alexandi kept living through perspectives that interacted with Nessie in different parts of the timeline, so she grew fond of her over time. Without some greater connection to Nessie, I don't think Alexandi's redemption is as strong as it could be.

Anywho, that’s all I’ve got! Thanks for the story!
