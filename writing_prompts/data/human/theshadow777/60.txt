It's a world of insane color, unimaginable sensations rocketing against my skin. And my companion? Perhaps the only semblance of the reality I understand. My refrigerator, still with the nearly expired milk, and ham that I'm ninety percent sure has been in there for three years. 

"It's an entirely different world, filled with wonders!"

"Look, even if it isn't real, I'm still intent upon enjoying it, so would you Please shut up," 

The refrigerator did not at all look like he was going to stop rambling. I'll admit, whilst I've never hallucinated, or taken any drugs that would make me hallucinate, I'm at least sixty five percent sure that most people's hallucinations don't have sentient refrigerators doing their absolute best to convince themselves that it's all real. 

But none of that really matters. What mattress is the world before me, so entirely beautiful that it almost eludes explanation. Well that, and the fact that someone probably drugged me back on Earth. But so long as I'm here, I'm intent upon enjoying my time.

"So are there like... Other living things here besides us?"
