I used to be the best, beyond any other human being. When they managed to replicate the serum that made me, I saw what that meant. The desert is a lonely place for a bleeding man. 

After days of travel, I managed to stumble my way into an old gas station. With the lights off, and no traffic in sight, I broke protocol. Chips were shoved into my mouth as I grabbed whatever water I could. It took me what felt like hours to move on. 

The heat of the sun failed to loosen, and at least half of my water ended up poured onto my head. I stumbled along the only road I could see. Nobody would appear to save me; that was never how this sort of operation worked. 

Days passed,  before I made it to the nearest city. My patrol had managed to get there before me,  army cars spread across the vast expanse. The town was in ruins, bodies strewn in every direction. 

"Am I glad to see you," My commanding officer whistled,  "The Supersoldier Initiative went awry, we need you to clean up the mess,"

All I could do was stare towards him blankly. The wound in my side, from the shot he had fired was barely patched. 

"You're on your own," I replied with the smallest of smiles.
