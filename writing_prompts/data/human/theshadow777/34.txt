None but I understand the deep crawl of infinity. Stars are born, and die just as easily. Each microcosm is made of an impossible balance, aeons of time creating complex patterns of life. I, was nothing, the end all of everything. For centuries I sat with myself as naught more but a construct.

Until one fateful day, I encountered a philosopher, upon a lonely and wretched planet. He was talking amongst his people, and he decried my very existence.

"There can be no such thing as Nothing. For even the very concept belies the existence of a Something,"

His words were like a planet breaker. To hear such a casual sentence, it gave me a meaning incomprehensible. Surely I could be something, beyond simply the ending of infinity.

Years passed in solitude, the endless void splitting thought after thought. It wasn't until yet another fateful day, that my entire world was to change.

My hands were sculpted of the infinite dark, and I felt them reaching into the very root of existence, taking pieces I hardly comprehended, and jamming all of them together. In moments, I had formed a rock, about as small as that desolate planet.

Time passed in uncertain patterns, yet from my work I would not be swayed. Piece after piece was formed together, until I had something more, something beyond even myself. I had taken the fragments of accidents, and created Life.

In that Infinity, I became Creation.
