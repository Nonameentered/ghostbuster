Humanity didn't achieve faster than light travel when it first took to the stars. Nor did it happen when they made for Mars, or the moons of Jupiter. Within that time, they focused upon something else, something they felt to be of greater import. For it simply could not be ignored that humanity was not suited for space.

So instead, they applied changes to certain people, creating an entirely new Race. They were to be known foremost as Space Marines, the great Colonists of impossible strength and intellect, superhuman within all of their Qualities.

It was only as the Marines reached the outer edges, and made contact with the planet Pluto, that travel faster than light was speculated. For there exists a barrier outside the rim of the Galaxy, an ever growing void that they would certainly be trapped within, if they could not fly faster than it's expansion.

So came the day, when a small legion went beyond the reaches of the Milky Way. They were four hundred strong, and prepared for any obstacle. Oh, and what an obstacle they would encounter.

They called themselves the Orn, from what primitive translation technology could figure out. They were six feet tall, only one foot smaller than the Marines. Six tentacle-esque arms floated alongside their body, each moving in vastly different tasks; until they attacked. They were like snakes with moving Vertical bodies, and would've certainly posed a threat in different circumstances. You must understand, however, that the Marines were built for Space, and any task therein that might need to be performed.

The Marines learned along the way about a Federation of thousands of different species within this galaxy. According to the files that they found, this Federation would immediately capture any species that ascended to Faster than Light travel, and enslave them for exactly one thousand years. They would burn the history of the species, and then Indoctrinate the children into the Federation.

Humans, at this point in history, had grown beyond the ties of prejudice, but the old scars were still very real to the men and women of the Marines. They refused adamantly to be ruled by any species, and thus began a war like any other, spanning thousands of planets, and an insistent tribe of men and women that refused to die within the unforgiving void.
