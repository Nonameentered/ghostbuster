"Yeah sure, I know magic at birth!" My brother loudly exclaimed, "But you... You can do things with magic I never could! I wouldn't ever even Think of shooting an illusion of fire, then teleporting behind an asshole, only to set up a trap in the fucking Past so that he'd trip over a wire and then be unable to defend against the fucking slashing hex you put inside the damn fire illusion," He calmed himself down as he put a hand in his face, the coffee he'd only taken a sip of long forgotten, "I-...I mean. I had it all since I was born, yeah, but dude... You've Always been a fucking genius, and no matter what I do, I just can't help but feel like you're always somewhere above me, using what should just be parlor tricks with real, horrifying techniques,"

I sat there quietly, taking a sip from my coffee. It had been quite awhile since I'd had a conversation like this with my twin. The last had ended with both of us yelling loudly at one another, and me spending a year on my own. Slowly breathing, I spoke.

"When we were six... I got yelled at for even daring to use magic. Do you remember that? I got to the paddle because mom and dad were 'scared' that I'd hurt them or anyone else, all because of what I could do. Any genius I do have with my art is because I didn't have a Choice," 

As my brother tried to find a reply, I very carefully uttered the syllables for the heating charm on my coffee. After a moment, I judged that it was enough, and carefully made sure to end the spell. My brother was still thinking of what to say, and I sighed in relief. My coffee had not blown up this time.
