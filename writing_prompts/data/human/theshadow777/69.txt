Long ago, in some ancient time, I made a deal. Upon the earth was a man dressed in a cloak of thousands of colors. To me he came with the most simple of requests. In exchange for a soul, he would give me whatever I desired. So within that ancient time, I presented an interesting question.

"What if I could give you a multitude of souls? Sell to you all things that you would need for your ascension?"

"Well how could this be done?" Asked that weary existences.

"Make a bet with me. If I might daresay, in a thousand years, if I'm allowed to live for such a long time, I will swear to have a million souls sold to you. If such a thing is done? Then I will gain from it a power above all others. Mayhaps even enough to make me the ruler above the seven seas,"

And this man of so many colors said onto me, "Well you certainly provide an interesting offer. Yet, might I reply, what is there for me to gain, in such an interesting endeavor?"

A smile fell gently through my lips, *Well, if such a failure is meant to endure itself upon me, than I promise to be that sacrifice of necessity. A living subject provides more potency, no?"

So upon that day, our deal was struck. The years after have stretched themselves into forever. I have learned the objects of common men, and things that they perceived as holy. I have walked the water, I have turned water into wine. Here in this passage I have set the beginnings. Yet, in much that same way, I have grown uncertain.

Studying the human existence has allowed me to understand their frailties. Here, in the days before they set me to the Cross, I ponder how far and wide these teachings might go. If I see that these first trials shall fail, than mayhaps I will have to forge others.
