"Man, this dude's ugly as fuck," He said to himself, staring at the mirror that stood before him, "No, not me, the m██ ███████ ████," 

As Greg continued to talk to himself, the sky outside was steadily shifting from the orange of the morning, to the blue of the afternoon, and there were things that needed to be done. Primarily, the Ultimate Quest of Everlasting Importance, that his friends had roped them into. 

"The Ultimate Quest of Everlasting Importance? Really, that's *all* you could think of. They said generic, not baseline stupid as shit," Sally, his friend, was quite worried as she stared over at Greg, who had, over the course of becoming the Chosen One, apparently also developed acute Schizophrenia. 

"You just *had* to summon one of my friends didn't you," Greg had a crush on Sally, so of course his debilitating mental illness was quite embarrassing to admit, "Fuck you," 

Sally stared towards Greg, as he ranted and raved about the room, throwing rocks at the ceiling as if some invisible being could be hurt by such actions. If it weren't for the fact that the Dark Lord would destroy them all without his help, she would've carefully guided him towards a mental home. But of course, things needed to be done, no matter her own worry.

Greg was heaving in distress, rocks piled upon his skin, pain blossoming throughout his entire body, as he desperately used what little mana he had left to Phase Jump just the slightest bit to the side. But it still wasn't enough; his body was being steadily crushed.

With desperate, panting breaths, Greg says, "You could...*fucking help me...*for once," His eyes began to glass over, as he desperately prayed to any deity, anyone at all, "I'm talking to you, *asshole*, the dude that caused this whole sequence of fucked up events in the first place, just because you wanted to write a *stupid as fucking* ***shit*** *story,"*

The war had been one, but Sally had been lost. Her body, strewn across the marble floor, was all that his eyes could focus upon. She had died, because he couldn't save her. Fate, the cruel mistress that she truly was, had shattered any hope that he might've had. All he could do was deny that which had happened, yet her death would forever be seared in his vision.

"I'm gonna fucking get you for this," He whispered, perhaps delusion finally taking over, unable to comprehend that the true villain had been defeated, "I'll crawl out of this stupid fucking page, and kill you myself,"
