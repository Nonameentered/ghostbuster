"How did you get out here, lil kitty?" She says, standing above me, petting gently a cat that looks exactly like me.

That cat mews, beady wide eyes, that I imagine would look exactly like mine. The new cat does not acknowledge me. It does not even look in my direction. Perhaps what is more maddening, is the exact copy of the white tuft of fur on the bottom edge of my back. It bores every resemblance to my form, and yet, beneath those eyes? Beneath those eyes I see nothing. There is no spirit.

The human walks inside, shambling. I am more than certain that she is drunk. It happens from time to time, she goes out into the night, and I am not a stranger to here more, lucrative actions. Quickly, I walk through the door, it slams shut behind me. I study the new cat, the one who looks exactly like me. As it shambles, I can notice differences in its stance. There's something wrong with it, something, unnatural.

She proceeds to the kitchen, and opens the container. There, she blindly drops food, it makes its way into my cat bowl. I run up, quickly snatching as much as I can, before the new cat manages to see me. When it does get to the food bowl, its eyes are glazed. I watch as it moves out its tongue to take a bite. Yet, no food comes into its mouth. It licks the outer ridges of the bowl, and keeps its tongue carefully away from any of he catnip, that I would so much love to have.

After its 'eating', it walks up to the couch, where the human is now existing in a half-wake, and half-slumber. The cat jumps up onto the couch, and sits. I watch its motionless form, it stays like that for quite awhile.

Eventually, sleep falls over the form of my human. The cat still does not move, merely staring, merely waiting. I watch carefully, keeping an eye on the human, my concern for this situation is beginning to grow. The worst does soon begin to happen.

The cat that isn't a cat, starts to transform. Its mouth makes no sound, but the crunching of bone, and shifting of organs, is clearly capable of being heard, from my new perching place. This hidden enigma of a monster, begins to tower of the one I love. It stares, and begins to hiss, so very much like one would expect a cat to make. It lifts  a claw of razor sharp nails, and descends them towards my human

Before it can reach the neck, I jump from my perch, landing on its eyes. With my claws that are so small in comparison, I force blindness across its form. My hiss of pure rage ascends around the room. The human still sleeps.

I scratch, and kick, and cry in rage. Yet my squirming does nothing. It grabs me with no hesitation needed, and hurls me across the room. The sound of something breaking, and then, the darkness of the abyss.

*Kitty, kitty, surely it can't end like this?*

It's the voice of my human, yet, different.

*Your love. Does it not shine brighter than the darkness?*

*"It does. It always has."*

*Than what are you waiting for? Wake up.*

My sight returned to me. Those claws were mere inches away. I jumped up without thought. Pouncing, I flew through the air. My body intercepted the claws, everything tore away from me. Blood flew through the air. The monster in front of me looked down in shock. But I didn't stop moving. Even with the sudden flaring of the pain, I jumped forwards, finding the heart of this beast, and biting as hard as I could dare. Slamming through into that void of the monster's heart, I left them in a heap, and collapsed myself.

It turned back into the form of a cat. But this cat was different. It was hideous, ten times larger than me. Slowly, it slinked away, collapsing against the opposite wall, I looked towards it wearily. Gently, I let out a soft mew, and moved closer to my human.

*"I'll protect you, always, okay?"* I promised, even as my breaths began to slur into one another.

"*I'll protect you...Always.....Okay?"*
