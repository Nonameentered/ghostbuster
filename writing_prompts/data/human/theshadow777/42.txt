He was the one above all, and his Mark was the cross. The earliest of vampires all watched when he was once upon the Earth. When he had a son, the Romans saw him for what he was, and yet they did not strike; they waited. Years passed in that biding time, when the son took up the Mark of the father. 

Some believed him to be the father of all vampires, our powered blood coming from his veins. Others believed him to merely be a powerful vampire, with powers beyond our own. Even more sought to covet the abilities that he had learned. Yet none of that matters. All that truly matters, is that no vampire touches the cross.

The cross was their Mark, before the Son himself died. After His death, the Father disappeared, as if he had never existed in the first place. The blight of fear that kept the human's at bay had now disappeared. They began to walk freely upon the Earth, inventing technologies unprecedented, whilst Vampires began to flounder in darkness.

We were once able to walk amongst the light of the sun, freely feeding whenever it is that we pleased. We were your esteemed nobles, men of great power and greed. But then the Father disappeared, and with it, the slightest portion of our power. We became weak, even when we are strong; stuck within the meager lights of the moon.

One truth, is that vampires do not have night vision. We have the same vision as everyone else, only from need do we exist within the land of the dark, only by need are we better with our reactions. Such is the common shape upon which our world takes. A sad truth, but one nonetheless.

But now, within the depths of the night, there are whispers of the Father, and of his return. Hopeful reassurances have made themselves known by those deep into the alleyways. None can know for sure, but we all hope...We all hope for the Father's return.
