Her room was cluttered with Magical Objects in the making, one being a gigantic gun that she could somehow wield with one hand. She was currently sitting in a room filled with explosives, and her mother stood in the doorway, trying her best to think of a way to tell her to clean all of that up, and not start another one of her famous rants. 

Then there was her son. Somehow, her son thought she didn't know about his budding abilities. Yet it was obvious, with the fact that he knew what anyone around him was about to say. He had been the bane of her love life, unnerving every person she tried to bring home by answering their questions before they could say a thing. It bewildered her that he never knew what he was doing. 

That was the mess that she was now trying to sort. Her daughter would inevitably set off an explosion at the dinner table, and her son would answer every imaginable question five minutes before someone got the nerve to ask it. Too many of her dates had been scared off by the two, but she hoped the next one would be able to stand it.

In the end, it had been a purple-eyed katana wielding lady that had stolen her heart. Someone who, at one point, had probably been a main character themselves. She was desperately hoping that she would manage to stand up against the constant energy that exuded themselves from her two overpowered children.
