I think it was about a week into testing things that I realized the true horror of it. You see, everything I'm 'finished with' automatically closes itself off. When I say everything, I mean Everything.

As that week went on, I became more and more frantic. A thought was pulling itself into my head, one I couldn't ignore. So I did the only thing I could. I walked through the house that me and my parents used to live in, staring silently towards the drawer that still sat in my room. In there sat a number, a number I was certain the individual would still have.

"Hey, um, is Jake still around?"

"Jake died thirteen years ago," The voice on the other end began to shake, "I-it was right after your fight, and then you moved and got a new number..."

But I wasn't listening, I Couldn't listen. How many other people had I killed? Just how far could an ability like this go?
