Internally, he was panicking. Why had they brought him to a clinic with *humans*, he'd trained to work with Pokemon, not people, what did they think was going to happen? Of course, the last thing he'd learned was the Cloning Initiative, and the fact that nobody other than the interconnected hivemind of *Joys* could work on Pokemon, and if he wanted to work with them, he'd need to be synthetically transformed into *joy*. Which, he liked keeping his man bits, and not being functionally brain dead, so no thank you. 

The man that had once been stared at him accusingly. Admittedly slowly intermingling the man's DNA with that of a Pikachu probably wasn't the smartest idea...But what else was he to do? It was one of the first things they'd taught in Training, you 'healed' a Pokemon by intersplicing their DNA with that of a fresh one, giving whatever person was stupid enough to get their pokemon killed, the impression that they'd only fainted. So of course, it was really outside his paygrade to work with human subjects.

"Pika Pika!" The pikachu squabbled indignantly. 

Maybe he really should've become a *joy*, that probably would've been easier than handling this. Then again, it was the hospital's fault for shoving him in here.
