I will admit, that the day I saw the being standing over my bed, I did something rather foolish. It was action that I am in no way proud of. But what is someone expected to do? When they find a dude with a Skull Face standing over them, just prepared to absolutely demolish everything they've worked for, of course they're gonna run!

I guess, when I got off of my bed, and just slammed onto the floor in a dead sprint, I got Death off-guard. Not something I really thought I was going to do; surely something that too many people in the past have tried to do. But I got quite far, I think. At least I made it out of my bedroom, and onto the street. Then Death appeared in-front of me; quite calmly, honestly. 

As for your question, I don't believe that I deserve to go to Hell for that. Would you put a person in Hell for running away from a Serial Killer? That's just like, it's like putting someone in Hell because they didn't want to eat a Hotdog on Tuesday.

What do you mean it's a completely different thing? How was I supposed to know that running away from Death is an Intergalactic Offense? It's not like we get Rulebooks on Earth, on things we're supposed to follow...It's ingrained into the human psyche before birth? That's bullshit, because it quite obviously wasn't ingrained in mine. Not to mention disobeying subconscious inclinations isn't exactly something that you can base an entire human existence on. 

You're willing to reduce my sentence in hell to five years? Five years in damnation, burning and having my organs ripped to shreds by maggots? Yeah, no. Do I get like, I don't know, a lawyer or something? Oh I don't, y-you just don't have those? Great.
