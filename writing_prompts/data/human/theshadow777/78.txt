The alley was splattered with a thick, gory overcoating. No one else had been willing to get as close as I had, as I stared at the lit phone the used-to-be-human was holding. It had been set to happen, in fact, the convergence had gotten dangerously close to occurring. 

As I stared at the man, I noted the number he'd been dialing. He'd understood what was happening the instant it started, I could see as much. The world over had heard about the Convergence, and how people of particularly.... Vile internet personalities were being taken over by their darker counterparts. And this man had known, and his desperation had led him to this. I could hardly think about what kind of person the man had been, for him to call the police... And then shoot himself shortly after.

Carefully, with both gloves and a bag, I pocketed the murder weapon. There was no need to investigate the crime, and I would tell the others that. With time, the world would forget about this man. And if I was lucky? No one would be asking questions, and this would all just be a 'suicide case'.
