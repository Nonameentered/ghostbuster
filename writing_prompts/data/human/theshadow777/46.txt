The Prophets had proclaimed that whoever pulled the sword from the stone was the rightful ruler. I had been the ruler of the lands for the last five years, and they had then convened to dethrone me, clearly. So I did what any man does (if they have a semblance of honor), when their right to rule is challenged, I met the challenge head-on. 

People were gathered around the stone, pulling and yanking at it in desperation. I watched with amusement in my eyes, as not even one of the many people around managed to get even a budge from the sword. It would seem that destiny well and truly held the blade within its grasp. Yet still, I held no worry within my veins, as I walked myself into the line.

Those that had gathered around the sword attempted to part when I appeared. I raised a hand and stopped them in their tracks.

"If any shall raise the sword from the stone before I myself do, then I shall lay down my crown to them. So please, take your chances now, or forever hold your tongues," And so they did, rushing forwards in an attempt to steal my throne; and I waited my turn, as respectfully as any King should.

Then, as my turn came, I calmly placed my hands upon the hilt, and stared towards the blade itself. I could almost taste the magic that welded it into place. Such a strong and ancient magic it was, that kept the blade where it was. I nodded, before pulling at the sword.

For a moment, there was no budge whatsoever, as there had been for none other. Then, all at once, it pulled outwards, and shined within the light of the setting sun. I stared towards the sword with a calm and easy smile. 

That night, I was ushered in to the private tent of the Prophets. All of them were staring towards me in confusion, and some in shame. I smiled kindly towards the lot of them. They would not be disbanded, but I was certain they would never hear the end of their mistake upon this day.

"We...Apologize," The Head Prophet said eventually, "For ever doubting the authenticity of your rule over these lands," 

"It is quite alright. If anything, you helped me cement my status as the True King upon this day. For that, I am thankful,"

"So you will not disband us?" He looked towards me hopefully.

"Disband the Prophets? How utterly foolish such a thing would be!" I proclaimed, "That would be like attempting to annihilate the Centaurs, or hunting the Phoenix for Sport! No, you will not be disbanded. If anything, I shall offer the protection of my Royal Army, as should've been done before,"
