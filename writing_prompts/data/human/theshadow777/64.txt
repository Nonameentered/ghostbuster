I swear it was just a normal game of golf. Okay fine, we were using human heads as our balls. Yes, yes, it's a human foot too, but all of it was just on a dare! What kind of dare includes severing heads? Well I don't know, I wasn't exactly thinking about the fact that they were severed heads, okay.

How could I not be thinking about that? Okay fine, I'll be honest about it! I was at a Halloween party, right? And there was this book, and the pages were red. Some dude made a dare and...

That's the most cliche story you've ever heard? Okay, tell ya what, why don't I go ahead and put Your head on the golf course, ya bastard.
