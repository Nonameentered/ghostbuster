I stared towards the man across the street, the man with the scythe and the black eyes. Nobody else could see him but me. It had been a long time since I'd encountered one of their kind. It was the night that my best friend had died, the night I'd accidentally killed him. We'd been playing on the playground, when I decided it would be a fun idea to trip him. His body went cascading straight into the metal bars of the jungle gym.

My hands were shaking, as I stared down the thing across the street, praying and hoping that I wouldn't die tonight, or I wouldn't have to take a life. He merely stared, patient and content to wait things out. It didn't matter to him, of that I have no doubt. He would stand there until the deed was done. 

"Hey, stop it, get the hell off of me!" The voice echoed into my ears, and it felt like the world came to a complete halt. 

My heart was beating outside of my chest, as I stared down an alley to my right. A man and a woman in a desperate struggle, there was a knife in his hand, and her purse had clattered to the floor. Within her purse sat a revolver. Everything inside of my chest ran numb, and my thoughts stopped at a dead halt. Movement, outside of myself, and a sudden understanding.

Footsteps echoing like a jackhammer, as I moved into that alleyway. The puzzle pieces slotted, chess pieces all in accordance. My hand reached out, and latched at the revolver. A cold taint in my hands, I could almost smell the blood. 

As my arm lifted up, I stared dead straight towards the man. So consumed was he within such a horrid emotion, that he hardly noticed my finger wrapping around the trigger. When he looked over at me, it was far too late. An echoing bullet, slamming straight through his skull.

I watched on in an almost passive state as the *thing* moved forwards, reaping his soul. It stared towards me for a moment, before a strange, hollow smile lifted onto its face.

"Arbiter of Justice, I bid thee farewell. May we meet again," 

As it disappeared, memories suddenly flooded through my consciousness. It hadn't been an accident, that night. I had tripped him for a reason. He'd been doing...Things, and I couldn't abide by it. So I'd lifted my foot, tripped him, made it seem like an accident, all so he could get the justice he deserved. 

My mind shook as even more memories rushed into my skull. For the first time in my life, I *understood* what I was. I was an Omen, an Omen of Justice. Just as quickly as the realization entered, it left. Justice was never truly meant to know what it was, for such power would corrupt any mind inevitably.
