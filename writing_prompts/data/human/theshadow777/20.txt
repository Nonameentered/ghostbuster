It was startling, impossible even, to stare at the strange creation. It mirrored everything that I had ever made, in such a way that made it even more frightening. This thing...Was not mine, yet it sat upon my rock. Millenia and Centuries had been dedicated to the crafting of life, carefully leading events to where they now stood. Everything upon this planet was something that I had made; yet this one was *not*.

My form was that of a man, when I descended onto green pastures, carefully crafted under what I assumed would interest the individual before me. Strangely enough, whilst I existed within the thoughts of all others, I could not peek behind the veils of this particular individual. This left me deeply disturbed, as despite being human, this individual felt entirely alien. 

"Do you mind if I walk with you?" My voice was soft, carefully curated, as I stared into hazel brown eyes.

The man looked towards me, a furrow in his brow, "I don't not mind. But what might your purpose be?" 

"Why must you assume me to have a purpose?" The question was philosophical, not quite meant to have an answer, but an answer this individual indeed gave. 

"All things have purpose," He replied with a small smile, "I made them that way," 

It was then that a great unease settled in the middle of my gut, one such as a human might even describe it as fear, "You made it that way, you say? What exactly might you mean, good sir,"

"Well, it started with the fire," He described, "A great infernal engine, that sits in the middle of the eternal cosmos; it is what began the universe that I created, the one we stand within," 

All I could do was stare towards...Not the man, but rather the supposed *god* that stood before me. Surely such a thing would not be possible? I remembered quite clearly the process that brought the world into fruition. It was with my own words that the entirety of the universe came into fruition, not with a fire.

"Say, I don't quite recognize you. What might your name be," 

"My name...It's ███ ██████████ ███████ █████. What is yours?" 

"████ ██████ ███ ██████ ████ █████ ███ █████. It's quite nice to meet you," 

Before I could generate a reply, the being before me had disappeared, leaving a trace of impossible light and darkness behind it. 

All I could manage to comprehend from that conversation, was the fact that I was not alone. Something deep within my very being whispered to me, telling me that I should never have known this fact, that such a thing could erase my existence. Taking a deep breath, I scrubbed the memory from my being.
