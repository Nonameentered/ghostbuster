What most people don't understand, is that sometimes, all that's really necessary is a dog in the right place, and the right time. That dog had now ended up in a completely different world, in the most random of places. It walked around for a bit, sniffing at its strange surroundings, and that weird smell of smoke and industrialism that it hadn't been around for quite awhile.

Then came the most peculiar man, he was wearing black clothing, with a crown of such deep red that the man allowed him to sniff at. With that, the weird Shadowed Man gave him a smile.

"Who's a good boy?" The Dark Lord asked, extending a hand.

He wagged his tail, and moved closer. 

Sometimes, it only takes one dog in the right place, to change the course of history entirely.
