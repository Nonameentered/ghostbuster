It's not all that easy. A token of the business is the fact that you can't look at what you sell. See, everything's kept under bandages, careful wrapped to make sure you don't know. A lot of my fellow business partners, they lose their minds...Quite quickly. I, however, I managed to hold onto the ledge, riding cosmic waves in utter ignorance. How? If a person wants a book, I don't retrieve it for them, I teach 'em how to get it themselves. There's rituals, and so long as you stay out of the nasty bits, you keep your mind quite free from all of those soaring mind-birds and impossible colors. So I give them the instructions, and send them on their merrily damned day. 

Now, sometimes I get a tricky customer. These are the sorts that might drive you mad yourselves. They start asking all these questions that I don't have the answer too, and they do real well at trying to make you seek answers for yourself. Luckily, I've never been that curious of a fellow. So I just grab the right book off of my shelves, out of the many of my books that I don't read, and I hand it over, business as usual.

What do I do when I've got one of them entities in my office? Good question; typically I get a warning. When dealing with an entity, I put myself in a blindfold and get some of those noise cancelling headphones. Oh they typically want something from *you* in particular, like some insight into the human consciousness, or your blood. I don't take them blood fellows, because they have a nasty habit of draining a man dry, and then leaving him to experience the imminent death of the cosmos on a multiplied scale. There's a reason they don't call 'em vampires anymore.
