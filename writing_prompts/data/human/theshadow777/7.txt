It was a day like any other. Reading stories and writing my own becomes boring eventually. So, like any other person in the fits and throes of desperate boredom, I found myself scrolling. An endless series of prompts that all look exactly the same; those were what met my eyes. If they looked even remotely different, the misspellings were so atrocious that you could hardly even understand what they're trying to say.

So of course, I found a few, replied to them with a couple of stories. Those went nicely, I believe. But more and more, I found that same disquiet, disappointment, perhaps even dismay. There was nothing more than lazy attempts at saying the same things. Nobody bothered to consider something different; like robots they replied an incessant ramble of the same things.

There is a theory, of course, that the internet is slowly being taken over by bots. A perfect place to try something like that would be on a Writing Prompt platform, wouldn't it? I mean, who would notice a difference if they're all similar. 'Oh it's just the unoriginality of the internet' despite the fact that people come up with plenty of good ideas normally. But not, it's probably just lazy people, right? Unless, of course, you consider that all of the failures and misspellings *are* the faults of a bot, some company testing out an AI software and seeing how well people respond to it. Almost like all of the ad posts on Reddit, where every question is just a generated bot that responds to companies and companies alone.

But who am I to claim such things. Just scrolling, looking for something interesting. Maybe the true hell is the disappearance of humanity, where we can look at some rando person on the internet and just decide to say  'oh, they're not real, no way'.
