One of his eyes was covered by an eyepatch, an entire arm was missing, replaced with a prosthetic. But within his one remaining eye, was an anger unlike any other. His body had been twisted, broken, and reborn, more times than he could ever count. The sheer amount of deaths he'd suffered because of the negligence of superheroes...It was enough to make any person curl into a ball, and just hope that they were left alone.

But he didn't want that. He didn't want to curl into a ball, he didn't want to let himself fall to waste. No, something needed to be done, something that could teach these 'heroes' to treat their sidekicks with respect. So he did the only thing he could think of, he unionized.

It was like a wave slammed into the sidekick populace, dominoes falling across the entire board. Sidekick after sidekick unionized alongside him. They went on strikes, showing the heroes just how much they mattered, and how decrepit the cities could become without them at their side. They were the hope, the positivity that shined alongside the desperate and deranged. 

When it came to an end, laws were passed; heroes were no longer allowed to have twelve year-olds as sidekicks, certain stipulations were put into place, and a Sidekick Protection Act was officially set as a law. Superheroes across the entire board were put under regulation, to make sure they had things up-to-code for any sidekick they might have.

A smile drew over his face, as he watched the changes sweep over the entire board. No longer would sidekicks be treated as meat-bags and defensive shields.
