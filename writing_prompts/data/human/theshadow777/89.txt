My parents called me a 'latent genius'. It got kinda old after the sixteenth thousand run, and yet now I was even later into all of it. Once you explore every avenue you can take, that being murder, solving all of the world's problems, etcetera, etectera, there isn't really much to do. 

I started trying to think of something else. I was already making investments into the marketing trends of this certain time period, gaining money whilst only really being ten years old. Sometimes I would use it to buy a video game that I hadn't already explored, other times I would use the money to help the financial situation my parents are in, and other times I would invest in more, lucrative areas. 

You know, once you've talked to someone about five thousand times over, had them as a love interest in high school, or done something else with them, they start to become extremely boring. But, I knew a couple of uses for some. You see, in one timeline, I employed one of my friends to help me with a murder, in another, I set them up to become a crime lord. In this one, I knew that if I played my cards right, I could make them part of a certain gang, that would eventually grow to control the underworld of the city. If I had them in my debt, and somehow made them the leader of the group, than maybe I could end up as the shadow-boss of this specific organization, giving me enough money to do what I wanted to do.

My intention is simple, the objective, not so easy: Become Immortal.

If I can do that, I'll never have to go through the same old scenario, time repeating at an infinite loop.

All it needs to start with, is a small little ball, one cog in the machine.

He was sitting right in front of me, drinking hot chocolate, and if in the future, he knew what was best for him, he could become far more powerful than most individuals get to be. Who knew? He might be part of the cocaine epidemic that happens with a couple of celebrities in the future. That, and we could even get into some serious business.

In the end, he won't matter. He's only part of the plan. 

I've already tested this before, ten million times. I think I've figured out my problems from last time.
