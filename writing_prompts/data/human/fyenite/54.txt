Hey makita,

So, I pretty much want to mirror what Xack said in terms of praise. It was a very adorable story and a really nice wholesome twist. Though I'm not too familiar with DM speak myself, I will say you really did nail a pretty good mood for Fiona at the start. That whole introduction was pretty great in general.

As critique, I'll pretty much echo what's already been said just so you have a place to read it.

I think there's a misconception here that the gang messing around within the campaign was a new thing. I think I assumed this was a regular occurrence and this was just the moment Fiona decided to put her foot down.

The only other thing was with the introduction of the "beach resort". We kind of started off in the middle of that argument which was a bit confusing.

But again, we've already discussed this in a lot of detail in Cafe.
