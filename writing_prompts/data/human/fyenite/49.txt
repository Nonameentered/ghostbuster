Sirens blared throughout the city as the first Trio bank went under lockdown. Bars came down over windows, searchlights came to life in the middle of the day and the good people of Fairyfail city went into a mass panic.

Fifer pig, however, giggled to himself mirthlessly as his pigs wiggled with excitement. “Yes, finally time!.” And thus, Fifer charged into the bank, pellet gun raised just as the doors locked shut.

“Now listen ye insufferable do-gooders. I ain’t here t’ hurt anyone, just want the money is al–”

And right on cue, The Big Bad Wolf leapt from a broken window in front of Fifer. “What seems to be going on here then?” he asked the cowering crowd. But Fifer had other plans. Dodging to the side, he fired a pellet square at The Wolf’s head, hitting his mark perfectly…

And the pellet bounced off.

“Darn!” Fifer squealed, his tail coiling out of anxiety. “Deep web guys said it’d work!”

As Fifer fiddled with the gun, The Big Bad Wolf huffed and puffed and blew Fifer into a conveniently placed prison cell.

Fiddler had heard of the embarrassment that was Fifer’s heist earlier that day. And he planned on something a bit more spectacular.

The sirens blared in the city of FairyFail once again as the second Trio bank went under lockdown. Much like with the first, bars came down over windows, searchlights spontaneously rose from the roof and people ran about in a panic.

But this time, another flickering light accompanied the white searchlights. And the citizens of Fairyfail weren’t panicking for no reason. For the second Trio bank was in the middle of a raging inferno.

Debris fell as bars melted, windows shattered in the heat and Fiddler cackled. “Oh, it’s glorious most glorious. Soon, the bank will burn down and I’ll be able to walk in and take the gold!” he wheezed as his tail wobbled excitedly.

He was so distracted, that he didn’t notice The Big Bad Wolf jump down behind him and begin to huff and puff...

“Oh heck,” were his last words before the wolf breathed and blew the fire out. But not before Fiddler was thrown into the raging inferno. And suffice it to say, the scent of crisp bacon wafted throughout the city.

It was a week later and all was peaceful. No siren blared from the third Trio bank and yet that’s where The Big Bad Wolf appeared to confront Practical; the third little pig.

“What seems to be going on here then?” he demanded in his booming voice.

“Oh nothing,” Practical replied. “Just cashing in an insurance check.”

“...You know I nabbed your brothers for attempted thievery?”

Practical blinked innocently

“Seems suspicious. What’s the insurance for?”

“Oh, my poor brick home was burnt down last week when a mysterious wind–”

“Err, never mind then. Be good.” And he left.

Practical oinked as his tail wiggled excitedly. "Why rob a bank when you can commit insurance fraud?”

Sidenote: Apparently the fable of the three little pigs is a fairytale according to google, so I'll assume it is then? I hope it is.
