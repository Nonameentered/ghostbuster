Hey Alex,

This was a bizarre and wonderful take on the theme, I must say. I very much enjoyed the characterisation as bantam has already pointed out. The little details about what year they were in were also a great touch to add to the setting of this whole thing.

I just have a few bits and bobs for you,

> liked they did most nights when they weren't out busy looking for food.

I believe you want "liked" to be "likely".

> In a blink of an eye, he spotted his worst nightmare - the robo-police.

So here, I wasn't sure if he spotted the robo-police in the wall or in real life. We get the answer later but maybe clarifying by placing them may help? Say, you could say something like "he spotted something emerge from behind a car. His worst nightmare - the robo-police." could work. Although, I recommend trying out your own thing as you'll almost definitely be able to come up with something better.

There was also a fair bit of repetition in here I think. Perhaps cutting down on it may help?

I hope this helps.

Good words!
