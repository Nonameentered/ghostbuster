Hey Astro,

I loved this take on the theme. You do a wonderful job of showing how just bored Fred is during the whole encounter. But then at the end, we learn that he actually does want someone but he's just terrible at it. Very nicely done.

I quite liked the continued metaphor and similarity between this and fishing. I think you reference them right at the right moments. Nice touch!

I just have a few bits and bobs for you,

> Fred goes to the urban watering hole by his apartment every night. When he steps into the bar,

Hmm, so you have this metaphor of a watering hole and fishing which is great. But then you immediately break that by mentioning the bar right afterwards. Perhaps you could be more subtle with it? I can't think of much else right now but I think this could be improved a bit.

> Fred makes his way through them to bar.

I think you're just missing a "the" before "bar"?

> Fred places the money on the table, and a bottle is placed before him.

Just a bit of repetition of "place) here. Maybe you could have the bartender "slide" the bottle to him?

> So I don't come this bar often,

Just missing a "to" before "this" here I think.

> Her hook is sending vibrations in the water.

So a really nice comparison to the fishing metaphor here. But I think it reads a bit weirdly. Maybe something like "Her hook sends ripples through the water." might work better? Just a thought.

> but patience was instilled into him over the years.

So this was an odd line to end on. I feel like you really delve into Fred's sorrow about being alone which is great, but then you pull it right back here. I almost wonder if you reworded the whole paragraph to start with this line, and then have him slowly admit to himself that she's right could work better.

I hope this helps.

Good words!
