Hey words,

I really liked this. I think you used the theme words quite well. Lol, better than I did at least.

> "You always talked about sailing across the universe through your telescope."

I especially liked this line here. Such an awesome use and metaphor. So really well done.

> Rao might have pointed out the haze of toxic smoke that was omnipresent in the air now, but he didn't want to vindicate her defeatism.

Oh, and a great ending here too. I really liked the humour you used right here at the end.

Hmm, as for crit, I'd say a few lines did read a bit weird. Bits like ""Where's your sense of spontaneity?" Mel was asking her now." did feel a bit odd with the tense. I don't know why you have to specify that she's saying this now. But that could just be me.
