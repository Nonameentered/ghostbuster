Part 1

The forest came to life as Eddy crashed through the treeline, stray vines and branches snapping at his face and exposed arms as he weaved between trees. His legs beat furiously beneath him with distress as the forest lurched out of its previous still state.

A bang rang out through the trees as a dark blur whizzed past Eddy’s head. He jumped in alarm and redoubled his speed as the old farmer raised his rifle again, a foul curse on his lips. Just as Eddy rounded the final tree and disappeared out of sight, another shot rang out and ripped through the tree right behind him. He was showered in wood chips and dust as his legs gave up beneath him and he tumbled down a hidden hill.

The sun dipped below the horizon, stray beams still making their way through the branches as Eddy stirred awake. A river gushed lazily by beneath him, bathing his legs and feet in its cold waters. Eddy groaned in pain and exhaustion as he sat up, blood running down from a fresh gash in his leg and into the water. Numbly, Eddy watched the crimson drops produce clouds in the water, and then flow lazily by. They were at the mercy of the currents it seemed.

Cringing at the sting, Eddy raised his head to look at his surroundings. They were unfamiliar, cold, plain and all the same. He rubbed his stomach; the familiar famelicose gnawing at his gut. But that was no trouble, he could just eat some of the bread and cheese he had stolen from the farmer.

A sense of panic filled Eddy, making the ache of hunger all the more pronounced as he searched in vain for the little pouch of food he’d taken. Dejectedly, he watched the currents flow by once more; they must have taken that too.

Cold, hungry and injured, Eddy tested his leg before leaning on a tree on the banks of the river. The rough bark scratched his back reminding him just how much he hated nature. If all had gone to plan, he’d be at home enjoying his winnings right now. But no, he just had to wake up that darn rooster, calling the farmer to the barn door. He’d had to break through a layer of rotting planks just to make it out unscathed before taking off into the forest.

A slight hiss alongside a smooth thing slithering on his hand made him jump back and collapse to the ground again. Raising his eyes, Eddy watched a snake hiss angrily before wrapping itself around another branch and slithering away.

Oh, how he hated nature.

Gritting his teeth, he reached for a nearby branch and tested its strength before using it to stand up again. He’d get out of here. Maybe he’d even be able to find the sack of food before he even left? Come on Eddy, Don’t part with your illusions now, he thought as his own doubts began to settle in.

With a grunt of determination tinged with pain, he hobbled away from the river and deeper into the now-silent forest.
