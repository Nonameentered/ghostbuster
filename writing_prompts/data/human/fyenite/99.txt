Hey Hedge,

Heh, what an amusing story. I really liked the over-the-top instructions given here. The exaggerations of what to expect and what you'll have to do and such are pretty hilarious. And the stuff about Chef Paul is just icing on the already amusing cake, heh.

I also quite liked the little bits of exclamation you have too. The all caps at times just adds that extra bit of characterisation to our nameless mentor.

I just have a few bits and bobs for you,

> We put the hades-heat close to you because the sear is EVERYTHING. We want you to focus on the sear above all.

Just a bit of unnecessary repetition of "sear" here. You make a point of doing it on purpose later but because it's spread out more there, it works. Here though, you might want to get rid of the second one.

> go down the street and, fucking, work at Dorsia

You can get rid of the commas here I think. The pause doesn't make much sense and it flows better without, in my opinion.

>  Seriously! Itâ€™s a firable offense.

You also repeat "seriously" a good few times. Just felt a tad unnecessary but that might just be me.

I hope this helps.

Good words!
