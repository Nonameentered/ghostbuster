Part 3

'I am a camera with its shutter open, quite passive, recording, not thinking.' Those were the words going through Jordane's mind as he plugged in the drive and booted it up. His brief sojourn by the computer lab would go unnoticed seeing as he was in charge here and all of his regiment were loyal to him.

Even so, he couldn't help but feel goosebumps crawling up his arm and quick glances towards the sundial through the window. He laughed to himself mirthlessly as his eyes fell on the old timekeeping device's shadow. "What are they going to do to us," Jordane mumbled to himself, "replace our greatly outdated equipment with stuff that's even more outdated? Are there even such things older?"

Simply put, Jordane felt left behind here. As if he were lost. He was homesick for everywhere but here.

Jordaneâ€™s breathing hitched and his arm began to shiver as it usually did in moments of stress as the page finally loaded. His eyes bulged as he looked through the dozens upon dozens of data tables. At first, he didn't understand, but then his old research mind kicked in and he began to make sense of the mass of numbers.

And he trembled evermore.

'Everything that has happened to me has been amazing and surprising,' he thought to himself as the reality of what was coming began to dawn on him. The pain, the suffering. The end.

Suddenly the emergency lights above began to glare and the sirens began to blare. He hastily plucked out the data stick whilst cursing his curiosity and dashed through the door.

He'd post the drive as he was supposed to then find out what was going on. The sinking in his stomach told him that he already knew though. The old cameras in this place still worked and that damned mainland officer had been watching. Well, he'd just act like he'd seen and done nothing. Like he was innocent. Like the break at the computer lab was just that, a break. 'My post was his home and that's where he ought to be,' Jordane thought to himself as he hurried down the grimy corridor.

'I turned away from the flashing red lights and hurried to my house.'
