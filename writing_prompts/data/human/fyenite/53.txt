Hey Rest,

Huh, I could have sworn I had already left feedback for you. Maybe I forgot to hit send? Or perhaps Reddit is bugging and you can see it. Either way, let me give you some more in case I'm dumb and it didn't send.

>Word games, number games, board games. Talk about bored.

I really liked this line. I think it injected a bit of much-needed light-heartedness into the story. I also quite liked how this led to our character complaining a bit more.

>Now I could get down to the business of enjoying my last day and forestall a year without summer.

Minor nitpick, but this line felt a bit flat. Vague? I wanted something along the lines of "Now I could get back to the business of drinking way too much..." That isn't to say you need this line in particular, but rather, I think I wanted one final line really showing the difference between Robert and our main character. Robert's a nerd who likes board games and such whilst our character seems to find them boring

Also, good luck with your project, Rest! I'll admit, I'll miss your fabulous TTs. But alas, if I have to forgo a few weeks/months of Rest TTs for an entire psych thriller novel by them then I guess I can make that sacrifice, haha.

Good luck my friend.
