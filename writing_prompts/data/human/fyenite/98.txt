Hey Astro,

Heh, nothing like an evil villain taking over the city planning department to make a truly frustrating process even more frustrating.

I really liked this story, it was really well done. The bits where Alin is shown to get angrier and angrier are great and the way Maria just builds it up more too. Very well done.

I just have a few bits and bobs for you,

> Why are there bylaws?" Alin says.

Perhaps "Alin asks." or "Alin demands." may work better here?

> Maria laughs, and the other two join with tears pouring from their eyes.

Hmm, Maria seems like a calm and uninterested person. So laughing kind of broke her character for me a bit. Maybe having her be silent whilst the others chuckle with tears in their eyes could work better?

> "If you suggest that again, I'll cut out your vocal chords."

So, this was when I thought a plot to turn everyone over to Grioras was going to be revealed. But there was nothing? The story ends with a mystery which I think takes away from it. Maybe adding something to the end may help?

I hope this helps.

Good words!
