"I..." Liv repeated disbelievingly.

But it seemed the suited man had stopped paying attention to her, now leafing through a stack of papers in his briefcase. Liv started at that, only now noticing the luxurious leather case. "Ah, here we are." He produced a rather thick folder and looked it over. "Now, you won't be expected to read all of this, don't worry. All I need is your signature and then I'll be off." He held out the folder complete with a fine fountain pen expectantly.

"Well hold on just a second," Liv muttered, her confidence growing now that she had a few moments to process the suited man's sudden appearance. "I'm not signing a damn thing." She crossed her arms and narrowed her eyes to seem more intimidating, "and if you don't get out of my lab right now, I'll call security."

The man just stared at her, eyes drooping and unfazed. "You don't believe me?" His question was more of a statement, and yet he still paused for an answer.

"Well of course not!" Liv replied dismissively.

"Well then, I guess you might find what you're looking for behind you."

Liv was halfway through realising the meaning of what the man had said before a loud wet squelch emanated from right behind her. Not pausing to think, she immediately jumped to the side as she sensed a giant mass of liquid flesh crash right beside her. "What the Fuâ€“"

The man approached LIv as she scrambled back up. He didn't even bother to glance at the giant slime monster before pressing a strange-looking gun at it and firing. Immediately, it sizzled and steamed, flesh burning up and shrinking until the mass was no more than a puddle on the ground.

"Believe me now, Oliviana? he said, pen outstretched.
