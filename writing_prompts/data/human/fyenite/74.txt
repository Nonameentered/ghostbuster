Hey courage,

Woo! I hecking loved this. So much detail, so much hope and fear and everything. I really liked how this whole story revolved around this one questionable fish and how our character went about preparing it. You've got the desperation down really well here. The sniff and then whiff, followed by the methodical cutting was all excellent detail.

And then the organs and the eyeballs! You know, I think that comment about never having felt under is very much true, in my case at least, haha.

And you know, I quite liked how you left the ending open. Did he get sick? Was the fish good? No idea but also not really important as the story very quickly turns into this tale about enjoying a fish.

I just have a few bits and bobs for you,

> This trout would mean just a little more survival, a little more time.

Hmm, I think "survival" is a bit clunky here. Doesn't fit too well. Perhaps "sustenance" could work better? It also fits quite well with the next bit about time.

> It stank for certain, but only in the way fish ordinarily smell, well, like fish.

Okay, so I think the first bit, "It stank for certain," and the last bit, "well, like fish." kind of repeat one another. I think you only want one of them and honestly, the first one sounds the best.

> Slippery and cold to the touch I pinned it against a clean smooth rock with my left hand and deftly began to clean my meal, the edge of my knife audibly scraping against bone, as I cut long strips of pink meat from the carcass, discarding the digestive track, stomach and intestines.

First, a rather long singular sentence here. It just kept on going and going where I think full stops could go in place of commas.

Second, I believe "digestive track," should be "digestive tract,".

> You've never experienced hunger until you gleefully suck the eyeballs out of a fish head and squish them between your teeth, swallowing them down happily.

I believe you have a bit of a tense issue here. The first bit implies the past tense, so I think you want the rest of it to be like that too. So "you've gleefully sucked the eyeballs out..." and so on. Alternatively, you could make the first line present tense and match it up that way. So, "You'll never experience hunger..." Either way works I think.

I hope this helps.

Good words!
