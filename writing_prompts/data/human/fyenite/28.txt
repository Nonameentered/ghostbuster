Now that was pure brilliance. I just have one question for you5 So when are you thinking to release the novel? I mean I can wait a year or two, but honestly, I think you're already on the gold.

I'm kidding, it was brilliant. And absolutely not where I was going. At first, I actually thought it was based in a courtroom, lol.

Also, loved the basic human names too. Added a strange comedic effect.

Good words!
