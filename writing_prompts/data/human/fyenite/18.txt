Part 4

Sometimes you need to scorch everything to the ground and start over. It was two months after Jordane had posted the drive and he felt the weight of those words on his shoulders now. Something important had happened and Jordane didn’t know what. All he knew was that the politicians from the cities were coming to his outpost for something and they were coming fast.

The drive came back to Jordane’s mind as he ran through his early morning duties. Were they here for that? Did they know he had peeked at its contents before shipping it off? A chill ran down his spine as he pondered his next fear—the solid piece of metal in his pocket feeling unbearably heavy against his thigh. Did they know he had copied its contents before sending it off?

He swallowed hard, the decision in his mind finally clicking into place. He was going to leave. He had to. There really wasn’t much another choice. He was the underdog here in these buildings of rust. The stone spun around the shaker of their games. And so, he had no other choice.

He had come up with a plan before, a method of escape even before he had decided that he wanted to leave. No, not wanted, he had to remind himself of that. He had to leave.

He would slip through the gate at night and make his way back home. He’d immigrate back because this was now his home. Every time you find something that doesn't work, you're a step closer to what does work. Those were the words he lived by now. Coming up with an escape was difficult and led to dead ends often. Leaving wasn’t the hard bit but staying hidden afterwards was.

‘I have an interest in the outsider,’ he thought to himself. He’ll have to if he wants to survive the deserts.

And so that night he did. It was easy of course, no one expected the captain to leave his post so no one thought to question him. He took some rations, a bedroll and other supplies. And of course, he’d take the copy.

He’d strike out west, a friend from his childhood had called to lend him aid, shelter and a job. Jordane sighed with contentment, his journey to Vorn already planned out.

As the searchlights flickered past and left him in darkness, one final thought swam through his mind, ‘I am haunted by humans.’
