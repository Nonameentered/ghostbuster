Hey Bay,

Ooh, another chilling one for us I see. I loved how the murderer here wanted to help the police and the families but just couldn't recall. I liked how he felt guilty about it all, how he both couldn't believe that he'd done all of those things and yet admits to himself that there was something within him that might have driven him to do it.

I also think you did a wonderful job of keeping all the voices organised. You gave us details about a few, their appearance and such that added so much to the story as well.

That said I do just have a few bits and bobs for you,

> I slide the photos away.

I think you could use something like "push" here. I think it would show a bit more revulsion and disgust towards what he thinks he's done. Though, this is a nitpick that could be preference based so feel free to ignore.

> Sure, the police get it wrong all the time. But I don’t think they’re wrong about me.

So there's just a little bit of repetition of "wrong" here. Nothing too big. I think rewording the second sentence could help here.

> She snaps and I awake in my hospital room.

I'm not too sure what "She snaps" means in this context. Did she physically snap? Or do you mean it as the way she spoke? Because before this, we had some dialogue from her, so does the "She snaps" belong at the end of that paragraph?

One final thing: Why was our character suffering amnesia? You mentioned a head injury but nothing else. Why was he injured? What happened to him? I feel like, without an explanation, it just feels a bit too coincidental that our character forgot the details. Like it was forced for the story, if that makes sense.

I hope this helps.

Good words!
