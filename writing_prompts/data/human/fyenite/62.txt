#Resurface

For legal and privacy reasons, the names and intimate details in what you’re about to read have been changed and or removed. This is already bad enough without the damn government breathing down our asses.

Jeremy was a recruit in our little group back in the early eighties. A scrawny long-faced kid straight out of New York, he was probably the dictionary definition of cannon fodder. Well, except that he wasn’t much wide enough to effectively shield you from a shell. Though he claimed to be eighteen, he had the look and shyness of a freshmen and once you got to knew him, the sense of humour of a kindergartener.

So let me tell you it was a surprise to all of us when he picked up that M21 sniper rifle and proceeded to disintegrate every target in a half-mile radius. Heh, should have seen that stupid wide grin on his face when he came up to me after. I had already talked to him on the bus coming up to the training ground, so we were already acquainted. And after that, well, let’s just say being picked up into special ops soon after was not our greatest achievement.

Anyway, we’re all retired now, old veterans relaxing at home as we slowly waste away. Or, at least I was that late Winter night when a call came up on my phone. His voice was muffled and yet cracked at times too. He was beyond scared. Scared in a way he hadn’t been since that first day on the bus all those years ago. He kept on talking about someone coming after him, for vengeance or something. He rambled about a hotel and bodies and past sins.

Now, you’ve got to understand that we’ve been a part of some truly fucked up stuff in the name of the great US of A. Like, helped stage coups against sovereign nations levels of shit. So “past sins” isn’t exactly small beans.

So, I did what all sergeants would do, retired or otherwise, and got my soldier to calm down. After some coaxing and breathing exercises, I was able to get him to be quiet. I could hear the occasional voice on the other side alongside his laboured breathing and assumed he was at some bar or something.

Anyway, once he could speak more clearly, he seemed much more like the old sniper-wielding mad man we had all gotten used to. And after some more coaxing, he finally got to the point of his sudden late-night call and very soon, he was telling me about how he had made it into his current fucked up situation.

I’ll try and recount what he said in as much detail as I can muster,

***

It all started in Fall. There was a brief chill in the air and golden leaves blew down the road in great torrents as I dragged my favourite armchair down the sidewalk to the moving van. Denise stood by the front door giving me her usual giant ever-loving grin as she cradled a cup of cocoa with one hand and massaged her swollen stomach with the other.

Despite the cold, the slippery leaves and the fact that I had to move all the god damn furniture myself, I couldn’t help but smile at what awaited us in the Midwest. We had a secluded farmhouse all ready and waiting for us. I had everything ready and prepared to finally become a beet farmer. And most importantly, I had Denise, my loving wife, who was carrying our beautiful daughter.

Everything was set. I was finally going to escape all the nightmares and therapy and medication.

But then that thrice-damned invitation came in. All wrapped up in a stainless white envelope and smelling of luxury ink, I knew it was bad news when I first saw it.

‘We at Marvers hotel would like to show all of our heroic fighters just how much their pain and sacrifice means to us this veterans day. If you’re reading this then congratulations, you have been deemed worthy of the status of veteran and are invited to come down to your nearest Marvers hotel and enjoy our “hero package” for two. This includes three days of nonstop relaxation with our world class spa, two-acre golf course and giant play areas for your little heroes. So please, come on down and let yourself be admired.’

I still remember the look of sheer relief on my wife’s face as she handed me the letter and coupon. “This is exactly what we need before the big move, Jeremy.”

At my clear look of hesitation, she wobbled her mouth the way that she knew would convince me and persisted. “Look, we’ll be moving at the end of the week but we’ll have no furniture until then. So would you rather sleep on the floor or on a comfy king-sized bed?”

You can probably imagine my answer to that.

It was that very night that we drove our beaten-down old pickup to the specified address in the middle of nowhere in search of a relaxing retreat. The building, whilst I’m sure would have looked okay in the day’s light merely looked like a colossal silhouetted beast by moonlight. I recalled having this acidic drip in my stomach which burned my abdomen and made it hard to breathe. That feeling only got heavier as we made it inside and waited for service in the lobby.

Ah, the lobby. Now that was a sight for wild eyes. Giant, absolutely giant. Looked to cover at least the entire bottom floor. And it was empty too. A few seats and tables here and there but mostly just empty space, white walls and yellow halogen bulbs. We stood there for a few minutes just taking in the emptiness when this tall creepy dude snuck up to the desk and practically scared us shitless when he cleared his throat.

“Yes?” the guy asked in the raspiest fucking voice you can imagine.

“Err,” Denise replied, a little unsure. “We have this coupon…”

After a bit of referencing and comparing, the man looked up with a wide smile and a thumbs up. “Ah, good to have you, soldier Jeremy,” he growled. “I say on behalf of all of Marvers, thank you for your service.” His yellow teeth peeked from between his lips and his sunken eyes pierced my face.

“Um, thanks…”
