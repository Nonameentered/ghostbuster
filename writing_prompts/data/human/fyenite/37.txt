#Sacrificial Transportation

Part 3

***

The rest of the journey passed in silence as Samuel focused on the sheet before him and tried to make heads or tales of what might have been happening. Stanton keeps his attention fixed on the outside, the cool breeze blowing through his open window.

Eventually, the vehicle began to slow down though and Stanton forced himself back up from a deep doze as he sat up and blinked blearily at the rising sun and the bright cloudless blue skies behind it.

“We’re here,” is all I hear as the words somehow escape my lips. Samuel pokes his head out and, with much difficulty, he raises himself onto his own two legs.

Before us, the earth bears the fruits of many hours of manicuring and specific feeding. Gardens of all shapes and sizes pepper the area. Though they don’t all look man-made, the sheer perfect symmetry they held and the traditional orderly way they looked proved their illegitimate origins.

Stanton walked forward, not quite sure where they were headed but following the path nonetheless. Before them stood a wooden building of simple intricate design. Wood joined and curved and carved around to give the whole Shoin_Zukuri-themed building a deep beauty.

Stanton shook his head, looking past the architecture and simply entered the building. Samuel however was stuck mesmerised for a few minutes longer before realising he was stood frozen and promptly pushing himself onward.

The floor plan inside was simple and traditional. Long halls and large rooms were the norms and yet they never felt too large. It was a simple plan, perfectly executed. The place was tranquil, and after such a long journey, Stanton was happy about that.

He walked through doorway after doorway until finally coming to that last one. And as he endured the heavy swing of the final door, the face he’d least expected to see turned to him in greeting.

Stanton’s brother.
