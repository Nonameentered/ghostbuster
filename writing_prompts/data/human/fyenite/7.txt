Hey Xack,

All I have to say is To Jerry! The little rat who had a dream and achieved it.

Seriously though, I really liked this one. You did a wonderful job of making the speech feel real and interactive if that makes sense. It's Dr. Layter giving a final goodbye to the rat with only applause at the end as proof that the crowd was real. You kept the crowd alive with interruptions, laughs and chanting. You made the whole thing feel really real. So very well done on that.

Also, loved the twist at the end. Honestly, Jerry sacrificing himself to help the team out in such an unorthodox way sounds perfectly right from the little I've heard of the little guy.

I do just have a few bits and bobs for you though,

> The assorted lab techs and officer workers called out with a scattering of 'Yes' and 'Hear hear.'

I think you meant "**office** workers" here?

> Okay, he had a tendency to run off and steal someone's lunch,

So I think with the previous anecdote about Marge's lunch, mentioning "lunch" here again is a bit repetitive. Honestly, just a simple "snacks" could work well here too.

> It was Jerry who crawled through three stories of ventilations shafts to the server room.

Minor error here I think but did you mean "**ventilation** shafts"?

> "Crazy, wonderful little rat."

So one final thing that isn't really a critique. So this being Spooky month and all the spooky themes for TT, I fully expected the twist at the end to be that Jerry was in fact a human. The implication is that he's some sort of a test animal: a rabbit or a hamster or a mouse or, as you have here, a lab rat. So I was gearing myself up for the horrific twist of Jerry actually ending up being human. Just a minor thought I had whilst reading this.

I hope this helps.

Good words!
