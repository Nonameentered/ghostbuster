#A Succulent Journey

Part 2

It only took a day and a half more of riding in the train car until the squadron reached their destination. The rain had already come down in light torrents from the great grey sky as the train slowed to an agonisingly slow stop. Brightly coloured wildflowers had already begun to wilt, their rich colours fading to browns and blacks.

“Right!” Alpha called to her assembled squadron and cargo. We don’t have much time to get to the rendezvous and deliver Mr. Vorn to his expected location. So let’s move! And remember, night is about to fall and we can’t risk getting caught. They come out when the sun sleeps so we need to make sure we don’t alert the beasts. Understood?”

After a mix of nods and groans of ascent, the party began making their way through the great grasslands towards their destination.

An hour of wading through a sea of chest-high grass and then stop for a five-minute break. An hour of wading through chest-high grass and then stop for a five-minute break. And so on and so forth, the process was repeated.

In reality, they were trained to carry all the equipment they had for far longer distances but it was the environment that forced them to stop regularly. A combination of a metre-deep sucking mud beneath them and the literal sea of grass blades they had to push through tired out even Gamma, the largest and strongest of the core, which slowed down their journey incredibly. Those breaks, however, well, it kept them going.

And any issue they faced during the day, was increased tenfold at night. Low visibility and the occasional unintelligible groans of the Lost kept everyone on high alert.

It was a couple of days into the journey on foot during a rare bright cloudless day when Delta stomped up beside Alpha. Mr. Vorn plodded through the muck quietly a few steps ahead of them and Alpha was forced to lower her gaze from his back when Delta sidles up.

“So,” he said nonchalantly, his mouth filled with a bite of apple. “How long’d y’ think ‘t’ll be?” He swallowed the bite after a few chews and then raised his hand once more to take another.

Alpha glanced at him, an eyebrow arched and a slight frown plastered on her face.

“What?” he asked innocently, his accent suddenly disappearing in order to seem even more blameless. “Guy’s gotta eat, right?” He looked down at the bright red apple in his hand and gave the fruit a scrutinising look before turning back to Alpha. “Never quite liked these things, anyway. You know, I had a delicious stew premade and ready to be cooked up but no, can’t have that thanks to your rules.”

“Delta, you know we can’t have a fire out here. We’re literally surrounded by grass nearly as tall as we are for miles. We could burn ourselves alive in minutes if we aren’t careful.”

“Have you seen the mud around here,” he retorted, still examining his half-eaten apple with a displeased eye. “Mud so deep you could probably drown in it below us and the grass is almost perpetually wet. No way a fire could spread here.”

“Okay,” Alpha said in a tone that brooked no argument. “And the Lost? What of them? What do we do when they’re drawn to the flames and surround us. Sure, we could burn them but how well do you think that would go, hmm? And all for your stupid stew.”

“… Hey. Ndolé’s hard to make you know. And really hard to keep fresh enough to eat,” he tittered halfheartedly.

“Hmm, that doesn’t sound French,” Alpha pointed out, trying to sound out the word in her head.

“It’s from Cameroon. Or the old Cameroon anyway. Delicious food too, one of the great exotic foods from the old world. Too bad it’s gone off now though…”

The pair lapsed into silence as the bright yellow sun in the clear sky beat down its burning rays upon the squad. Alpha found herself being drawn to Mr. Vorn constantly as she continued to walk in silence. She felt Delta shift beside her and his eyes drawn to her.

“You know, you’re such an old fart, why don’t you just retire already?”

“What?” he replied, a little nonplussed.

“Why do you continue to be a part of the squad, when you’ve more than earnt your freedom to stay back at base?”

In response, he simply took a final bite of his apple and reached behind himself to make sure the sniper rifle was still strapped to his back. “I belong out here. As a sniper I mean. Doesn’t matter how old I am or how much I annoy people, I belong out here.”

And then he stomped off.
