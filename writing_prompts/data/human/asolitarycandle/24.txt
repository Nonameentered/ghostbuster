“Hello?” Barb asked to the nothingness before her as she sat sitting, shaking and unsettled, inside a poorly light fifteen by fifteen square room with no door. The air was minty, which she mistook for cold even though she felt the warmth of something radiate from the ceiling. Barb couldn’t remember how she got here. She also couldn’t figure out how she got in here. 

Testing the edges of the wall, Barb couldn’t seem to find any seam or give to whatever the room was made of. It felt rough. The white, speckled surface was easy to grip but hard as stone. It didn’t feel like stone though. Maybe it was a coating on top of something like stone.

“What!” Barb yelled out as a white glob floated down from the ceiling and parked itself in the dead center of the room. Letters appeared around it and a two-dimensional window formed to capture the floating font.

*Congratulations! You have died.*

“That’s… not,” Bard tried her best to argue but couldn’t think of anything coherent to say before the letters rearranged themselves.

*The information about your death may be traumatic to you but it is accurate.*

“Is this Hell?” Barb asked quietly as she shuffled her way to the corner of the room. Though in her late thirties, Barb felt worse than a child in this room. 

*Only if you want it to be.*

Barb stared at those words until they disappeared and then watched the orb without a word until something else happened. 

*Do you want to create Hell?*

“No, I was a good person,” Bard argued in a sudden deep panic from her corner, “I prayed. I went to church. I made food. You can’t do this. Please. Please, don’t do this?”

*Your universe. If you want to make it a “Hell” that is up to you.*

“What?” Barb asked with a frown. Sitting up she tried to see if she had read it wrong but opened her mouth wordlessly when she decided she hadn’t.

*Together we shall create your universe.*

“Together?” Barb asked.

*Oh, yes, I am your guide. I translate the output of universe’s metrics into a method you can consume.*

“Are you a person?” Barb asked.

*No*

“Are you God?” Barb tried again.

*No. You are that.*

“What?” Barb asked but more out of shock than curiosity.

*You are God here.*

“I need a drink,” Barb groaned at the screen and stood up. Deciding that she wasn’t in immediate danger from this odd glowing orb thing, Barb tried her best to understand the room. Every wall, every corner, and what looked like every part of the ceiling was exactly the same as she had experienced on the floor. Looking back at the screen it had changed but had rotated as she had walked around.

*Ethyl Alcohol has not been unlocked. *

“Well, how do I unlock it?” Barb muttered, “There's a bar somewhere in here?”

*Please finish the tutorial to start unlocking advancements.*

*Consumerism has not been unlocked.*

“Tutorial?” Barb asked, “Is that you?”

*Yes and no.*

“You made by the elves?” Barb asked with a chuckle.

*Yes and no.*

“I sort of deserve that,” Barb muttered to herself and nodded heavily. She swallowed hard before asking, “How did I die? I can’t seem to remember.”

*Car accident.*

“I drove a Volvo though!” Barb argued, “Those things are supposed to be the safest cars out there!

*You turned your airbag into a claymore by glueing crystals to your steering wheel*

“They were to correct my,” Barb tried to explain but a video of the event popped up and the moment of impact was played back to her in a solitary bang, “OH! Oh Good Lord! Why? What?”

*Good news is it was instant death. Bad news though was we had to revert your memory back fifteen minutes.*

“That’s,” Barb almost let herself drool over as she stared at where the video of her death had been.

*Do you wish your memory to be reverted back to before the playback showed*

“No,” Barb muttered and then groaned eventually. She shook herself hard at the feeling. She didn’t know what to think other than to ask, “My family, umm… my friends, are they okay?”

*Your family considers your death tragic. Your friends feel like your death is tragic. Both will remember you fondly.*

“That’s nice,” Barb muttered with a sigh but bit her tongue. Her family had always been a bit distant but she wasn’t sure if she wanted to know what ‘considers’ actually meant when it was clear that her friends would actually miss her. Looking back up at the screen, she asked, “Umm, okay, machine elf thing. What am I supposed to do?”

Thousands of different numbers, graphs, and panels filled the room, the walls and the floor as information flooded in. Barb looked around in a panic at everything and tried not to touch or step on anything that looked important as she backed herself back into her corner.

“What! NO!” Barb yelled out as more and more of her room got filled with information, “Please! Stop. I can barely use my iPad!”

*Running “iPad” configuration mode*

Quicker than the data had flowed into the room, it all disappeared. In front of the orb now floated a solitary metal-ish tablet like the one that Barb had before she had violently had her energy corrected. Getting up and staring at the screen, Barb grimaced at the number of flowing strips and windows that were open.

“What’s all of this?” Barb asked cautiously.

*Your budding universe*

“I meant like the numbers and colours,” Barb asked a little frustrated.

*It’s metrics on your budding universe and options on how to change them*

“Fantastic, look,” Barb argued, “I worked in advertising and design. If you want me to use your computer thing, that’s fantastic, but I’m better at pencil and paper. Possibly something from Adobe if you can get Charlie to set it up.”

*Running “Charlie” configuration mode*

A slimmed-down version of pastel borders and folders appear in front of her with a larger screen and a stylus in her hand. Barb was impressed. This was a lot more like work than she cared to admit. It was comforting. Not that work wasn’t in some way comforting but it wasn’t like Barb could admit that she would miss her boss.

“Can I just create a happy universe?” Barb asked.

*In time. Right now we have to go through the importance of physics and what universal constants you want.*

“Kill me,” Barb blurted out before she could think better of it and slapped her hand to her mouth. Groaning to herself, she asked, “How long until I unlock alcohol?”

*It’s unlocked as part of chemistry, which is part of this tutorial.*

“Good,” Barb muttered, nodding to herself and already needing it.
