“Oh wow,” Martin muttered, winded, as he turned himself over to try and stand.

He was dizzy but the adrenaline from the car that had almost hit him was more disorienting than that little fall. It had felt like forever but he figured that that was what most falls would feel like. Martin was careful. Even when he was a teenager, with peer pressure and hormones, he never attempted anything dangerous enough to get hurt. 

Dusting himself off he tried to figure out where he had landed. He was next to a small creek, sharp rocks and a thistle bush were beside him but that couldn’t have been right. Martin looked up at the ridge and saw the sharp corner sign he had been standing next to just a couple of seconds ago. Nothing seemed out of place, there was no path down here that he could see, and very little seemed to be disturbed. Worse, there was a rather sheer face that he wasn’t sure how he rolled down.

Martin looked down at his torn clothes and suddenly started to panic.

“Am I dead?” Martin asked the cliff face as he started to shake.

Nothing answered him. Martin, thinking this was a bit of a test, tried to look for some sort of sign even though he had never been really religious. The little bit of running water in the creek was clear enough to see through but it was the only thing that moved. His bag was by the bush and in rough shape. Martin realised he couldn’t hear any birds or wildlife and there wasn’t any sound of traffic from above. 

“Is this hell?” Martin whispered to himself. He shook off that idea quickly though and muttered, “No, there’s judgment before hell.”

Going over to the water, Martin looked into it the best he could but only saw river stones and a candy wrapper along the bank. The Coffee Crisp didn’t seem to scream anything obvious to him but he picked it up anyway and put it in his pocket. Some people couldn’t care less for how they treated this world and in Martin’s opinion, their judgement would be seeing the mess they created.

“Is this my mess?” Martin asked himself as he quickly took the wrapper out of his pocket to study it. It was new, the expiration date was still a month away but Martin had never eaten a Coffee Crisp in his life. He tried to figure out if he had ever been in contact with a wrapper like this. Nope, nothing.

Nothing continued to happen for what Martin guessed was half an hour as he tried to look for any signs or clues as to why he was here or what had happened. The stream and the thistle plant resulted in more questions than answers but Martin admitted to himself later that he could have tried a little harder with the thistle bush. He didn’t really want to get scratched by it and he decided on following the creek instead. 

The winding little thing met up with a river not long after Martin had started off and his opinion had made for a far better walk than the road had been. His camera and phone were completed destroyed but he still had his life and his food so he figured he’d last a least a little bit. The town he had been walking to, Miller Point, was on a river so, at least to Martin’s mind, he should be there sometime soon.

Martin started to get worried when that wasn’t the case. The walk from his campsite to Miller Point was only a couple of hours and he had been walking for just under two when he jumped out of the way of the car. Even if the river went around a ways, Martin figured that he would have arrived within an hour. The sun was getting far closer to the horizon than he liked considering he had started out around noon.

The sound of birds never reappeared either. When he was on the highway there were always little chirps from above and rustling from below but down here there were only the noises he made and the river. There wasn’t even much wind. Martin could feel a bit of humidity in the air from the river but that was all.

“Martin?” a voice asked from behind him but when he turned to look, Martin couldn’t see anything. He quickly looked around at the bushes and then up into the trees but came up empty.

“Yes?” Martin answered quietly but after not getting an answer he loudly asked, “What do you want?”

Standing as still as he could, Martin tried to see if he could see anything moving. The voice had been a man's voice, deeper than his, and he figured that the man had to probably be older. Something about the calmness of it got to him though. 

Taking a deep breath in, Martin could smell the river, the trees, and maybe some of the dirt but there wasn’t anything of other people. Some hikers smell like onions when they walk past while others have sort of a fishy scent to them. Martin couldn’t seem to sense anything. 

“Hello?” Martin the trees quietly, “Am I dead?”

Silence was all that returned to him. The trees didn’t answer him nor did the stream or any of the little plants that grew between them. Martin wondered if he had heard anything at all or if it had just been in his mind. Why would someone out here ask him by his name anyway? He hoped he would find the town soon. He needed a drink.

“We all think that,” a thin man in his late fifties said as Martin turned around and flinched hard enough to trip. 

Landing on his back, Martin shuddered at the sight of the guy. Resting on a crude-looking spear, the man was wearing something out of medieval fare or some such nonsense. Leather hide, carefully stitched together forming a tight vest with some sort of symbol on his left breast. More were fitted for shorts and a set of boots but they weren’t as carefully done.

“Hey,” Martin said, trying to crawl backwards a bit to put a bit of distance between them, “I don’t want any trouble.”

“Then don’t make any,” the thin man responded and gave Martin a rather unimpressed smirk, “You look rough.”

“I fell?” Martin said he quickly tried to see if there was anyone else with this man. 

A knot in his chest formed when he realised it was just them. Worse when he turned back and the man was gone. Martin’s head twisted and turned as he tried to find the man again but all his effort was wasted. He was once again alone. 

Standing up, he noticed that his shirt sleeve was ripped further now because of a rather sharp looking rock that Martin had just missed. He was thankful. With some crazy dude in the woods, it wouldn’t be good to get injured out here. Martin dusted himself off and started walking again.

“He was real,” Martin muttered to himself as he continued to follow the river, “Right? No, he had to be real.”

“I’m real,” the man said, now walking beside Martin. Martin yelled but at least he didn’t fall this time.

“Would you stop that,” Martin groaned as he took a couple of deep breaths.

“Can’t help it,” the man said, watching Martin carefully, “Not here.”

“What does that mean?” Martin asked, suddenly worried about what that meant, “What’s here?”

“Nothing,” the man stated and glanced around before asking, “Haven’t you felt it?”

“Felt what?” Martin purposely avoid saying that he had.

“No birds,” the man said, gesturing to the trees, “No bugs, no critters, no fish, not even a bloody bear.”

“Yeah, so?” Martin asked.

“What are you going to eat?” the man asked curiously.

“A burger,” Martin scoffed, “When I get to town I’m getting myself a burger.”

“TJ’s?” the man asked before thinking for a second and correcting himself, “or no. Tim said it shut down. It’s Big Bob’s now?”

“Big Bob’s shut down when I was a kid,” Martin muttered unintentionally.

“That’s a shame,” the man acknowledged, “Not that I’d know. Tim will be sad to hear.”

“Who’s Tim?” Martin asked.

“He showed up a week or two ago,” the man explained absently, “Him and Marge are nice. They find things. Marge told me to come to find you.”

“How long have you been here?” Martin asked.

“A year?” the man answered but didn’t sound sure, “Time’s real weird here.”

“Oh?” Martin asked, “In what way?”

“Well, you were going to Miller Point right?” the man asked.

“Yeah,” Martin answered, “Where are you going?”

“Same place,” the man said, “I have been told. I’m Fredrick Miller, my son’s and I cleared that space.”

“Oh, that must of been a lot of work,” Martin said, trying his best not to voice the alarms going off in his brain.

“It was,” Fredrick agreed, “We had four good horses so it could have been worse. You probably have stories of how it could have been better.”

“That is the story,” Martin agreed, “you forgot the wagon though. Fredrick Martin had four good horses and a wagon when he settled here.”

“Why would I include the wagon?” Fredrick asked.

“Because if you want to make it believable,” Martin scoffed, “You have to at least be accurate. Now, if you don’t mind. Is this the river that goes to town?”

“No idea,” Fredrick stated.

“Well do you know how to get to town?” Martin asked, not really sure if he would believe the man if he said he did.

“I have been hunting and tracking most of my life,” Fredrick proudly said and pointed a bit off of the river, “Miller Point should be about five minutes west southwest of here.”

“Thank you,” Martin replied. He wasn’t going to take the advice but if the town was so close then this was the correct river.

“You won’t ever get to it,” Fredrick explained, “What should be isn’t here.”

“That’s okay,” Martin said as he turned, sort of hoping the man wouldn’t follow him, and started to walk alongside the river again, “Thanks for the help.”

Martin didn’t hear the man respond and against his own better judgment, Martin glanced behind him to see if he was being followed. The man wasn’t there, only the small river and the trees. Martin was suddenly very aware that seeing the man anymore and not knowing where he was was a very different sense of danger. That spear looked incredibly sharp for someone who said there was nothing here.

Five minutes dragged on into ten and as the sun started to set, Martin felt himself grow cold as the river flowed on.
