“What are you doing here?” a quiet growl left Veloth’s scaled lips the second he snaked his head around the corner. “You cannot be here. Please ride as fast-“

“Veloth!” an exceedingly loud voice bellowed from inside the cave, cutting him off.

“Please-Go-Please-Go,” Veloth whispered quickly but shut his eyes and gave off a tiny whimper as pounding footsteps started.

“What are you doing?!” the voice asked, “We are not done.”

“I’m!” Veloth yelled in a panic, holding the ‘m’ as he thought, and looked around before turning and explaining, “Relieving myself!” he whispered a curse though before pathetically adding, “I don’t think that dear was healthy.”

“Why are you lying to me?” the other dragon demanded as she left the cave only to turn her focus on the three women at the entrance. Sternly, she asked quickly, “Veloth, who are these? Why are they here?”

“Oh no,” Veloth quietly whimpered to himself before looking up and explaining, “Mother, this is Princess Elizabeth.” He glanced back at the other two and then added, “and probably servants. I’m sorry, honestly, I don’t know.”

“Three humans dare to stand outside your cave and you apologize for not knowing their names?” the large dragon seethed, “I was disappointed before Veloth. This,” she continued to seethe and looked at the three women petrified to move, “this is pathetic. Are you at least here to die?”

“Not intentionally,” Elizabeth felt herself say as she looked up at the furious angry dragon in front of her.

“Is this why you haven’t had hatchlings?” the large angry dragon suddenly grew darker, “I swear by the Fire, Veloth! Your great uncle made that mistake and it nearly destroyed our clan.”

“Mother!” Veloth pleaded, “I swear to you, the royal family and I have an agreement. Elizabeth stays over every couple of years and I get to do what I want. We aren’t doing that. I’d never.”

“You are of age, Veloth,” the large dragon yelled at him, “You have missed three cycles and now I find you with these iron doodle things and human women at your entrance.”

“By the Fire,” Veloth whimpered, “phrasing mother.”

Elizabeth watched, petrified, as the larger dragon's eyes went wide and the strongest creature she had ever known cowered like a child. Nothing was said and no one moved. A long, growl like breath left the large dragon's muzzle as she glared at her hatchling. When she sucked in her breath, she bared her rows of fang-like teeth at the smaller dragon and stood over him.

“What did you say?” the dragon demanded.

“I’m sorry!” Veloth whimpered.

“What. Did. You. Say. To. Me?” the large dragon demanded, standing directly over her small son.

“You-talked-about-me-being-with-Elizabeth-and-then-said-she-was-a-my-entrance,” Veloth blathered out in an instant.

Growling at him, the larger dragon stepped back and turned toward the cliff. Without a word, she was off and, in flight, away into the mountains. The four of them watched the large dragon fly for a bit and then unleash a torrent of flame somewhere a ways from them. Elizabeth didn’t know what to say. She had never seen fire like that and hoped it didn’t spread.

“So,” Elizabeth dragged out the word as she turned back to the cowering dragon on the edge of the cliff, “That was your mother?”

“I’m going to die,” Veloth whimpered, not taking his eyes away from the path his mother had taken.

“Right you should,” Marabelle scoffed, “talking to her like that! How dare you!”
