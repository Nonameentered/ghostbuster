“I rose to this. I fought for this,” my Master argued to herself as she sat back on her throne of stone before muttering, “I did everything right.”

“Sounds hard,” I said, empathetically as I could. Hard to be when your town sacrifices you, on your birthday, after lying to you about being important. New month though, I am trying to make the best of it. My Master didn’t really have anyone who she could talk to other than me. Her wolf, really her only other companion, listened but didn’t respond all that much. Terrifying thing it was though and was usually covered in blood. I don’t want to know whose. I kept quiet most of the time when the two talked about work.

Master was pale and thin but was beautiful. If you ignored the half of her face that was paler and thinner that is. I’d seen this condition on someone before but never to this extent. Her hair was mostly platinum blonde with a portion of just pure silver. I got to braid it a couple times. Felt like silk. She cared deeply about her health. Always tried to wash and brush her wolfs fur but the thing never stayed clean long.

“It is,” she said eventually, “not the actual work but the isolation and almost hatred I get for this position. Probably should stop blabbing on about it.”

“No, it’s nice to hear you talk,” I said quickly, it literally was nice. Growing up she always seemed alien. An emotionless, moralless witch that was spawned from the ice up north. Here she was complaining like any of the other Jarls. “Are you able to, I don’t know, talk to anyone about an image change?”

“Goddess of Death, but only those who died in unbecoming ways,” she scoffed, “hard to have a good image attached to that. Look around, I have the cold halls of stone. Not the golden halls nor the meadow.”

“Well, we have those glowing mushrooms,” I tried to offer, “could plant some more of them and make this place a little brighter. Bet the golden halls or meadows don’t have mushrooms like we do.”

“Your adorable,” my master almost laughed, loud enough even to have the wolf look up at her, “I don’t think I have ever met anyone who actually wanted to make this place better.”

“Grass is alway’s greener crowd?” I asked, “problem with them is it’s usually their own issues turning their grass yellow.”

“Yes!” Master said and clapped, the wolf actually looking startled at that, “I’m not like them. Not like that. No grass here but, you're right, let's breed some of those mushrooms. Worst case, they can also be used as a sensitiser.”

“Alright, little dark but,” I said. I had been here long enough I shouldn’t be surprised, “How can I help?”

“Keep saying ideas like that,” she told me with a smile. Probably the first time in a while for this reason, “maybe next time we get visitors they’ll actually like being here.”

“Make it a home,” I muttered to myself.

“No,” Master snapped, “not like home. I can’t go back to those halls of ice.”

“Not like that,” I argued, waving it off, “Our home. We have to make this our home. I would never go back home either. It’s not worth it. They aren’t worth it.”

“They aren’t,” Master agreed, “I wish we would have met sooner. I don’t meet very many good people and most of my kind aren’t that great to me either. How was your upbringing?”

We picked mushrooms for a while. The wolf came and watched us; it eventually carried the basket my master was using though. I talked about life in the town, about how it was fine for a while but then the crops started dying and the river started tasting off. Everything got dark after that. People arguing more, my parents fighting, and then my grandparents passing.

“That’s awful,” Master said, “I can’t imagine She did not take an interest in the crop or rivers. Even He should have.”

“Well they didn’t,” I said simply, “now I’m here. Did you do anything?”

“Sort of,” Master said hesitantly, “River’s gone now so no more pollution.”

“You didn’t!” I almost yelled but burst into tears laughing so hard.

“It was my niece's idea,” Master explained, gesturing to the wolf. The wolf is her niece? She smiled at me though, teeth out in a really threatening way, “Dad once talked about meeting someone that was really good at fulfilling the truth in terrible ways. Uncivil obedience? Something?”

“Your niece?” I muttered and picked another mushroom.

“Oh, yeah,” Master said, stumbling over her words, “My brothers like her. Chained up though somewhere for pissing the boss off or something.”

“I’m sorry to hear that,” I said quietly.

“Oh no worries,” Master said and gave me a hug. A tight squeeze from such a small woman was fairly surprising but popping out of my body was terrifying. I could see myself go pale and limp! It wasn’t until the wolf almost warbled before my Master looked up and grabbed my spirit and tied me back into this body.

“NO!” Master yelled as she snatched my soul back, “sorry about that. Forgot that happens. I haven’t hugged anyone in a good while. Thank you.”
