“I just want to exist without fearing for my life,” I muttered.
  

  
“You can do that here now that the Cult of As’tovel is decimated,” Elliot said quietly.
  

  
“Who’s the next demon we have to face though?” I asked, “How long until they start a new war? How long until someone comes calling for my head?”
  

  
“War doesn’t happen where you live?” Elliot asked.
  

  
“Not by deities!” I yelled but again had to correct, “Well not by fire and actual brimstone creatures.”
  

  
“Must be simple wars if you don’t have magic,” Elliot scoffed, “You all running around with your swords and horses as the peasants do?”
  

  
“No we have guns and intercontinental missiles,” I grumbled, “And nukes, there’s always seems to be the threat of nuclear winter every decade?”
  

  
“What’s that?” Elliot asked.
  

  
“Large explosion torches the sky and sends the world back into the dark ages with a touch of a button,” I explained.
  

  
“That sounds like magic,” Elliot muttered.
  

  
“You have healing magic though,’ I countered, “We make things explode, weaponize viruses, and use computers to make ever-increasing levels of chaos. We can’t heal people with a wave of a wand.”
  

  
“It’s a Stirg,” Elliot stated, “Peasants have wands.”
  

  
“We still don’t have anything like a Stirg,” I explained, “But we also don’t have zombies and without all the crazy we went to the moon. Without magic.”
  

  
“How did you get around the moon giants?” Elliot asked curiously.
  

  
“That’s the thing about my world,” I had to chuckle at his question, “No… What in the world are moon giants?”
  

  
“Floating giants made of rock,” Elliot explained before digging through a couple of scrolls to pull out one and show me a crude drawing of what I assumed was a moon giant, “If you thought As’tovel was big you should get a sight of these things.”
  

  
“Don’t want to,” I scoffed, “I want to go back to a place where there isn’t giant moon creatures probably waiting and planning on killing me.”
  

  
“The moon giants won’t attack us,” Elliot said and waved a hand at me but hesitated and started to make a note, “You know, just to be sure we should probably look into that.”
  

  
“I want to live without having to look into the threat of moon giants,” I muttered.
  

  
“We have Spellstories though?” Elliot offered.
  

  
“We have video games,” I explained, “and virtual reality is becoming more of a thing.”
  

  
“You were still poor where you lived,” Elliot argued, “No amount of technology can make up for that.”
  

  
“No, I wasn’t rich,” I said, “I had enough for what I wanted. I just don’t have enough to afford a table like this.”
  

  
“How is that not poor?” Elliot asked.
  

  
“Even if it is,” I argued, “Why would I need a table like this?”
  

  
“For working on,” Elliot stated, rather dumbfounded by the question, “Where are you going to write.”
  

  
“On my computer,” I answered, “You know, the light picture you keep telling me is stupid.”
  

  
“It is stupid,” Elliot yelled at me, “How do you work on a fragile light picture. If you write something and want it gone how do you not break it without magic?”
  

  
“The delete button,” I stated, “I write with light. I delete it with light. I have said this like a thousand times.”
  

  
“And for the thousandth time, it’s stupid,” Elliot said lifting his pen and writing the same on his piece of linen and handing it to me, “That is writing. That takes thought. What you describe is reckless augmentation.”
  

  
“We aren’t going back into the internet,” I said with a sigh. That had always turned ugly.
  

  
“Library tubes filled with cats and sin,” Elliot muttered to himself before looking at me and asking, “Is that what you want, cats and sin? We have a brothel in town but you refuse to use it.”
  

  
“Again, I not using the brothel Elliot,” I said with a shudder.
  

  
“Well we have lots of cats,” Elliot argued, “Do you want more cats?”
  

  
“No, I don’t want a cat,” I said gesturing to the three large tabbys Elliot kept with him before turning to the Calico in the corner and saying, “No offence, Silas.”
  

  
“None taken,” Silas responded with his terrifyingly deep voice while he lazily stretched in his makeshift cave of pillows.
  

  
“If I wanted a cat I could have gotten one by now,” I explained.
  

  
“If one of my kind would accept something as pitiful as you,” Silas noted.
  

  
“Right,” I muttered and leaned into the table to whisper to Elliot, “I miss only being insulted by people.”
  

  
“Me too,” Elliot whispered back and shot his familiar a rather dark look. 
  

  
“So I’m going back,” I said quietly, “I just need to go back.”
  

  
“Well,” Elliot said with a nod, “I don’t get it but if you need to you absolutely have earned the right to.”
  

  
“Thank you,” I said, looking up at the odd friend I had made in this messed up place.
  

  
“Quick question?” Elliot hesitantly asked, “If I send you problems would you mind taking a look at them for me?”
  

  
“Do you think we could do that?” I asked.
  

  
“Dimensional doors are complicated to send living beings through but linen or slate shouldn’t be all that problematic,” Elliot explained.
  

  
“What about gold?” I asked.
  

  
“Gold shouldn’t be a problem either,” Elliot said with a smile, “I swear you are more a merchant than a scholar.”
  

  
“Everyone is a merchant first in my world,” I muttered back, “Not that that’s something I looking forward going back to though.”
  

  
“I can’t imagine,” Elliot admitted with a nod.
