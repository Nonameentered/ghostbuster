They called him Hiss. He knew why but it didn’t take the sting out of something so mundane being associated with the greatness that was Besmothern, the once Black Death of Vilna. Cursed now to live as the Black Death of scraps in St. Arther’s Reclamation Center. They were thieves. They had stolen him after he had gotten free from that wretched wizard that had cursed him. Hiss tried his best to make them fear him regardless.

“Oi! The bugger bit me!” a lithe, ginger man yelled out after a string of curses like touching this idiot was a desire Hiss had. He tastes like fish. Hiss wasn’t sure he wanted to know why he tasted like fish but he would bite the man again if he tried to get near Hiss’ coin.

The little Black Dragon had found it, stuck in the side of the wood along the edge of the kitchen, and had waited to see if the owner would come back to calm it. Hiss may have pushed it further into the wood so that it was harder to see but he had waited the three days Dragon’s deemed reasonable for a horde to be considered abandoned. By rights, it was now his and he would keep it safe.

“You try ‘n steal a Dragon’s treasure and you’ll feel more than his teeth,” a larger, heavier set man explained after the laughter had died down, “it gave you more than enough warning.”

“But it’s my coin!” the lithe man yelled back like it was a fact. Hiss knew it was his coin and he would keep it.

“You shouldn’t have left it where Hiss could take it then, Dalton,” the larger man said with a shake of his head.

Was that Dalton? Hiss could never remember these people's names. They all looked similar. Some were bigger, some were smaller, and some of them had different coloured hair but it was nothing to what his kin were like. Dragons came in more shades, colours, and sizes than the earth itself. Not that Hiss’ size was a natural testament to that.

Hiss’ head snapped to the larger man as he approached his from the side and got shown the same, now blood-stained teeth that had just been in Dalton. Trying his best to growl, Hiss sank his once-mighty talons into the wood of the table and switched to his trademark hiss. The large man only chuckled at the threat.

“Come now, I’m not going to take it,” the large man reassured as he put on a pair of thick leather gloves Hiss knew they had only for handling him, “But we do need you out from underfoot.”

Underfoot! Hiss wasn’t underfoot and he had never been. If these fools would let him be then he could take his treasure back to his cave as he had been before Dalton had started making reckless calms to the treasure he did not own.

A hand came at him again and Hiss took the opportunity to sink his teeth into the gloved hand of this would-be thief. Hiss earned a groan of pain for his trouble but the other hand came around his back and started to push Hiss forward. With his teeth sank deep into the glove and his talons locked into the wood, Hiss wasn’t about to move.

“Save this for the mice,” the man Hiss was attached to said quietly, “Come on, grab your coin.”

Hiss frowned around this idiot's finger at the insult. He wasn’t about to take orders like some pathetic runt. This man may be more than twice his size, by Hiss’ calculations, but Hiss had gone up against worse in his youth and had come out victorious.

Lifting Hiss off the ground wasn’t the task Hiss had assumed it would be though and when he felt the wood under him gave way he let out a panicked yelp. Turning his head, he tried his best to see if he could grab his treasure with his back legs to no avail. He was pathetically close to losing it.

“It would probably be easier if you let me go,” the man offered and waited for Hiss to make up his mind.

Hiss was less happy that he had to trust this man now than he was trusting of this man ever. He had seen what he was capable of with his servants, assuming these lesser men were this large one's servants. Not that Hiss had treated his own any better. Regardless, Hiss let go just enough to turn and with his wings, grab the coin and hold it close to himself. For good measure, though he sank his teeth back into the gloved finger.

“Little bugger,” the large man groaned as he lifted Hiss off the ground and carried him away and out of the common room, “How does something your size bite like that?”

Hiss’ only answer was to put even more force into his jaw.

“I know you can understand me you little lizard,” the man whispered as he entered the sleeping chamber that Hiss had made his cave in.

The old adage of ‘keep your enemies close’ had always been one of Hiss’ favourites and after finding himself in this ruin of a building he had taken it to heart. He watched this man sleep peacefully as his enemy towered over him.

Putting Hiss on the ledge above the dresser, the man tried his best to make Hiss detach his teeth but Hiss just stared at him. If he let go, who knew what the man would do to either him or his treasure now that they were alone. Hiss wasn’t going to let the oaf overpower him.

“Look, you want your coin in yer little hidey-hole then let go,” the man said exhaustedly, “If I knew you were going to work so hard for it I’d give you a job to earn more.”

At the prospect of getting more treasure, Hiss lifted up his head curiously but still held his coin tightly to his body. It was not a dignified position. With the diameter of the coin being just smaller than his torso, Hiss would have had problems moving it regardless of the fact that it was gold.

“You like that?” the man asked, rubbing his now ungloved hand, “You like the idea of getting more. I have these nice glass ear studs for you if you are actually able to get the mice problem under control. They may not be worth much but they do sparkle.”

Hiss narrowed his eyes menacingly at the man at the prospect of working for glass. He was a Dragon of value and glass was of no value to him. Not that Hiss wasn’t going to go after the mice in the building. The only thing about being this size was it was spectacular to go after pray larger than he was. As a Dragon of standing, he would have to feed on multiple deer a day in order to be fed. Now, one mouse both provided challenge and fulfilment.

Two days later, with his treasure safely hidden away from that fool Dalton and a fresh kill in his maw, the large man presented him with the stud that Hiss assumed he was talking about. Not that Hiss had done anything remotely near what the man had asked. He had just wanted to eat. Nevertheless, the stud was very large compared to Hiss’ size and sparkled as the man had promised. He let his lifeless prey go in order to inspect his new treasure with renewed vigour. It didn’t look like glass upon inspection.

“You fool, this is quartz,” Hiss declared triumphantly in besting the man, a thief, in appraisal skill.

“I knew it,” the man whispered, giddy with excitement, “I knew you could talk.”

Hiss only hissed back and scampered away to his cave in shame. His ego had gotten the best of him again and this man now knew it.

“Hey, no,” the man whispered to himself as he chased after the Dragon, “Wait, how would you like to earn something worth more than your coin?”

It took a couple of seconds but Hiss did stick his once-massive head out of his hole to glare at the offer the man had given him. Would he devalue himself to work for a human? Hiss had seen some of the things to come through this building that he had wanted. Maybe.

“Ah!” the man chuckled when he saw the amber of Hiss’ eye’s watching him, “You want a horde? I have more than a couple of jobs that would be right up your alley.”

Hiss only hissed at that.

“Good, we are in agreement,” the man stated as he went to his desk to pull out some papers that Hiss had already read. He had read them all.
