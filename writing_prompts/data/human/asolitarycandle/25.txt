—Red Alert!—

Vidi’s loud drone echoed through the halls as I made my way to my station. Black grease coated my hands and hung in the very air I breathed. It seems the air filtration system was acting up again. This shouldn’t have been a distasteful day. I should be happy.

The first clank my boots made on Vici, a C-Class freighter that was heavily modified to combat, was scripted and set. I was making the worlds under the Collective Association of Planets a better place to live. Better systems, better planning, and better people. That’s what I fought for and what I believed to the point where I bore every secret I had to a faceless monitor for the privilege of serving. 

Aaron, my contact, had given me little to no instruction on what to do or what my goals ever were other than blend in, fit in, and serve the crew as I would if Command had given the order. I did well. I had always served well but the grease and grind of the ship's engine was my childhood and these beings were my friends. It was a shame they chose the wrong side of this but my job, my mission, and my life was to correct the mistakes of their superiors. 

“This is Axel,” Disc, a scared but thick man introduced that day. Axel was as thin as a rail but I had found over the years that his will made up for his physic. That and Bear, the man standing beside Axel. Bear was like Disc but with much more hair. There was so much hair in the grease when Bear was working it became a challenge not to gag at the feel of it. I shook both their hands firmly only to find Axel the strongest out of the three of us.

Disc was in a way the true Captain of the ship even though Adrian was the true Captain. While Disc managed the crew, the ship, and the supplies, Adrian was the contact. I never saw him. In a crew of over fifty on a ship that was basically a high rise rotated ninety degrees, it wasn’t unexpected. Disc did most of the heavy lifting and made up for the dead weight. That was when he wasn’t the reason for it. 

Rough, callous-ridden hands and shoulders, filled my days with a hindrance and help that I was not expecting. Turnover wasn’t large but these men lived and died based on their use. Airlocks opened up new positions in the dead of space when missions went poorly and the hold held parties filled with shine and song. Don’t step up if you can’t keep up was something I heard regularly. Don’t step up if you can’t stand being stepped on was what I was warned. 

“To the Arseholes above us!” a memory flashed back into my mind, “for paying us to clean up their shit!”

—- Red Alert!—-

I thought they were talking about Adrian. If not that then it had to have been Disc. Someone told me though that the shit we cleaned was entirely the Collectives making. We cleaned the toilets in the Utopia that everyone else was sold. Unseen janitors.

Nothing, of course, broke through my belief of the marvel that was the Collective nor in the righteousness of Command. There was a dent after that night though. Rust started to form on armour that I didn’t know I had for the shit we were cleaning up was declared human trafficking but looked too close to refugee smuggling for my stomach to bear. Bear was fine with it. He said his family was once one of those that Vici had saved. That’s why he was here. 

Polishing my armour became less important as the years passed on and the blood of those I served with seeped into the cracks. I recited Commands and orders less and less. I celebrated the Collective's victors over the Outerrim with less enthusiasm than I had. I learned of the sacrifices that were made and mourned with those who had lost their families. Ash mixed with blood alongside the grease I had smeared into my armour.

Why were cities destroyed from orbit? Why were companies absorbed by the Collectives governance only to be gutted and rebuilt? Freedom from tyranny and injustice seemed to come with so much death. Why had I not known? 

Aaron must have known. Had he known? Did he know what I was doing meant for the people I was doing it against? I had to pull the latch that sent a couple of targets out into the void myself. The betrayal that etched their face into my mind still lingered like slivers of doubt that itched at my soul. I had given that up long ago though. 

“It’s okay to cry in your cabin,” Bear told me once after I had ejected a man I had trained and instructed for eight months for something I had done. Bear’s concern was real but my guilt would have to be snaked out of me if I was lucky to be granted relief at all. Bear's small, kind smile broke something when he told me, “We have to be strong in public to make the verse a better place. Your cabin is yours alone.”

“A better place?” I asked. Wasn’t that what I was doing? Why was he telling me that?

“For everyone,” Bear explained with a nod, “Not just for those deemed worthy to pay for the privilege.”

“What about Lenny?” I asked.

“He paid the Collectives price,” Bear said with a shrug before walking off to his duty, “Get some sleep Petie! Lenny is no colder now than he was before.”

— Red Alert! —- 

Was I cold? Yes. There was no doubt in my mind that I had done some heartless things for my mission. Lenny wasn’t though. It was hard for me to believe that I would let the memory of a man that I helped shape would forever be known for the actions, well, more mistakes that I had made. 

Why had I tripped the sensors on the observation panel? They shouldn’t have been on, or even functioning, in the first place. For a ship so full of holes and broken tech, it was shocking that we moved at all sometimes. We could see everything in front of us even though we were in the engine room. 

Questions. I had been told once in a different life that questions were the enemy of faith. One has to believe first and then seek the answers that the world is willing to provide. This, though, is not to be done by the common man. That duty lies on the shoulders of those deemed worthy enough to seek it. 

— Red Alert! —-

Ash, blood, and question though now lined my rusted armour as I stood facing the holopanel showing an armada. Onboard Vici we had three dozen families from the Collective’s glorious concurring of the Moon of Albernan. I did not agree with the freedom fighters, their leadership, or their values but I was proud to salvage those that were only trying to survive where the pain was a constant. 

— Red Alert! —-

“Pete!” Bear roared from above the bulkhead supports that wedged the engine away from the fuel lines, “Get your head out of the fumes and get up here.”

“We’re going to lose this one,” I stated, staring at the screens in front of me. One had proximity sensors, one had a live feed from the hold, and the last was coming in from the bridge.

“No! Not Now!” Bear growled at me, “You go squirrely on me and!”

“Don’t hate me!” I yelled as I punched in my badge number with a secure surrender code and sent them. 

“What are you doing?” Bear asked climbing down the ladder as I spammed the bridge for recognition. Bear watched as the Collectives ships powered down in a moment of disbelief before giving me a hard look and asking again, “What have you done?”

“Engine Room!” a voice screeched out of the console, “Engine Room! Respond! What happened?”

“You have one chance,” I explained, “Move up to the starboard bow of the lead at twenty percent capacity. At half a sect away go full throttle. They won’t catch us.”

“Engine Room!” another shriek came through, “Who is this? Respond!”

“It’s Pete,” I said quietly before saying sternly, “This is to redeem Leonard Pattern. I sent a code that’s a failsafe for an agent of the Collective.”

“You sure?” Disc’s calmer voice took over.

“Yes,” I confirmed, “Our war with the Collective doesn’t end here.”

The relentless hum behind me quieted down without confirmation. The engines behind me were brought down to cruising speed as the bridge manoeuvred us into position. Bear gave me a look that would curdle the grease around us but it didn’t matter. I was too numb to it all to care. 

My war with the Collective, against Command, at that moment, was beginning. There was ash, and blood, and questions to be answered. There were families that needed a home and a Utopia that needed janitors. If nothing else, I needed to stop collecting the demons that my faith had brought me.
