“System!” Zeel yelled as he tried to figure out if one of the blaring sirens going off around him was the life support. Ultraviolet, it was supposed to be the ultraviolet one. The walls weren’t glowing, right? Should be fine. “System?”

*Main Hull Breach! Engine Breach! Containment Breach! Navigation Offline!*

“System!” Zeel looked around for his family and let out a long hard breath at the sight of them encapsulated. The captain's chair, his chair, was the only one not to be locked down as he still needed to fly. With a nod, Zeel licked his lips and checked himself.

Emerald green scales seemed good, his tail was still intact, and his head felt okay. His headache wasn’t anything to celebrate, probably had a concussion with what just happened but he was alive. The system screaming at him wasn’t helping either. It wasn’t responding at all. 

“System silence alarms!” Zeel yelled over the noise. 

Nothing changed. Well, nothing that he had wanted. A small hissing started up behind him as hopefully, the life support was venting air back into the cockpit. Not that he’d know at this point. It could be fuel for the sublight engines but it could also have been the coolant for the hyperdrive. 

Unbuckling himself, Zeel found the floor far faster than he had wanted. The titanium floor was cold but at least it smelt like the oceans on Tallis with chemicals added for good measure. Life support. The scent was Ulra’s, Zeel’s daughter, choice. They had only ever had the credits to travel locally and the beach was her favourite. 

Zeel had been promoted the last cycle and with his wife Ulsa’s permission, he had saved for what felt like an eternity to surprise the family with one good vacation. What a disaster. Picking himself up, Zeel dragged himself to the Override panel and pried the cover off. Buttons, switches, and sliders, Zeel read them all before he touched them. First up was the alarms.

The air didn’t get better but without the knife-like noise digging into his head, Zeel felt a lot better about the situation. Nothing was good but at least the sound wasn’t hurting him. With a bit clearer head, he shut the engines down and isolated life support to the cockpit. He almost smiled when he heard the clamps lock behind the doors.

Ulsa’s panicked face emerged first from the pods and Zeel was ready for a noise worse than the alarms. The fury he worried about never left her lips though. No words at all left her as she quickly moved to his side and put her small hand on the side of his head. Zeel almost snorted when he saw how much blood she came back with. Made sense why his head hurt now.

Ulra’s screech was hard to hear but Ulsa went into what she liked to call mother mode. Their nephew and niece stayed quiet but Zerl, Zeel’s son, unbuckled himself and moved them all to the back. He was strong. Zeel had worried about having a son so small as Zerl had been but the young lizard had become one with the way of the wind. Zeel was so proud.

He felt cold. Not uncomfortable like the chill of winter but a slow drain of essence out of his soul. Zeel felt tired. Maybe the alarms were better to be on? At least then he had been easier to stay awake.

“Zeel,” Ulsa demanded, sounding close to breaking down herself, as she looked for sealant or bandages. Zeel was having a hard time understanding what she was doing. He wasn’t like the system. He did respond though. He was supposed to at least. Why wasn’t he?

“Dad?” Zerl asked from the back before glancing at Ulsa and asking, “Mom is he going to be alright.”

“I don’t know,” Ulsa whispered. She wasn’t supposed to say that. Zeel knew that. Ulsa was so strong, why would she say something like that? Shaking her head, Ulsa turned and pointed at the captain's seat and told Zerl, “Figure out where we are. We need help.”

“Earth,” Zerl stated hesitantly as he pushed the younger lizards back. Glancing at Zeel, Zerl’s eyes met his for only a moment but then looked away. Zeel was sad he couldn’t look at his son longer.

“We crashed on a red planet,” Ulsa closed her eyes and whispered. 

“I’m sorry,” Zeel whispered the best he could.

“No. No Zeel, it’s okay, we are alive,” Ulsa quickly backtracked, “We are alive because of you.”

“I was aiming for the one with rings,” Zeel chuckled.

“Well, you never were a great shot,” Ulsa chuckled back, “You need to practice more. We’ll get you lessons when this is over.”

“I’m sorry I’ll miss that,” Zeel whispered as lights flashed around him. 

“Don’t you dare,” Ulsa seethed quickly, panicking as Zeel lost more blood, “This was your trip. This was your celebration. You aren’t leaving it early.”

“The air here is breathable,” Zerl stated as he whipped through the computer logs on earth, “The red designation is because of the inhabitant's violence and weapons. Their isolation makes them unstable.”

“How does that help?” Ulsa wrath came out in a horse whisper.

“They may be able to help,” Zerl explained, turning around in the chair and pointing to the door that lead to the med bay. Well, what use to be the med bay. It was just an empty space now. At least what was on the other side of it wasn’t just empty space.

“We open that door,” Ulsa said, becoming as cold as Zeel felt as she put the pieces together, “We don’t know what they will do. Your father,” Ulsa broke her calm for a second to whisper, “damn your shell,” and then grunted to regain control before saying, “Your father needs help but if we open that door we may all need help.”

Zerl didn’t hesitate to get up and came close to the two of them. His boy. Zeel was so proud of his boy, the adult he was becoming and the adult he had already become. Zeel’s mind etched every scale on Zerl’s body into his memory so that if he was granted just one wish, that image would remain with him as he passed on.

“Not all of us,” Zerl whispered to his parents, “Just us.”

“I can’t lose both of you,” Ulsa whispered.

“If the humans don’t help I’ll run,” Zerl explained, “I’ll hide.”

“Let me go,” Zeel whispered.

“No, Dad,” Zerl whispered back, “Humans do care about some things. They may help. Worst case, I’m fast and they still have basic firearms.”

“I can’t,” Ulsa whispered.

“I can,” Zerl said as he shifted his father's weight to his small shoulders, “I can outrun anyone.”

“My boy,” Zeel whispered.

“Daddy?” Ulra cried.

“It’s okay,” Zerl answered for him, “We’ll be back soon.”

Zerl basically had to drag Zeel’s body to the hatch. Zeel was having a hard time now feeling his legs or his tail. The realization made his already cold scales grow crisp. It was a hardening experience but one that Zeel felt he would never forget. Not that he figured he had much longer to remember it for.

For some reason, the hatch opened with its own sort of hiss as the cockpit depressurised. Zeel felt his ears pop and a screaming pain rushed back into him. Holding his head was now almost impossible but the right side of his head felt wrong. Something was hanging off of him that went squish when he pressed it into him. His hand came away with so much blood. His green scales were now nicely warm but a sticky crimson mess.

“That’s not good,” Zeel stated to his hand as Zerl seemed to drag him forward. 

There were so many things in front of him now. It looked like one of the ancient pictures of days long passed when all the buildings were so thin and tall. There were things around them. They were big. Humans? They had a lot of lights.

“Please,” Zerl said into his translator and it echoed out some gibberish at the creatures in front of them, “Please help!”

Little noise was heard before but after Zerl had made his plea everything seemed to stop. The little pinpricks of light that kept flashing into Zeel’s eyes had focused on his son as the door behind the two of them closed. This was it. Voices started chirping something and the creatures started moving toward them.

“Get,” the translator on Zerl’s wrist echoed back to them, “Doctor.”

“That’s nice of them,” Zeel whispered before the darkness took him away from the pain he was feeling.

His son had emerald green scales like he had.

His daughter liked the smell of the ocean.

His wife loved the way he had proposed on the beach they had always gone to.
