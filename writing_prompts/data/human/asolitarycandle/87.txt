Isabel woke in her small, one-bedroom flat with light streaming in from her window. The city below was quiet for now but would be getting on in an hour or two. A short hiss of a bus could be heard occasionally as she looked around. 

In her bed, like every other day of her life, she found a small owl feather stuck in her quilt. It was a quant brown flecked beige feather that was no bigger than a finger. Sometimes there were a couple but more often than not it was just one. Growing up it always seemed odd. Unlike every other night though, Isabel had broken her parent’s rule and had her friends watch over her. 

That was weird too though. Shouldn’t they be here? They said that they would make sure nothing happened but something in the back of Isabel's mind worried that she may have done something. What if they were hurt? What if she hurt them?

Quickly jumping up and out of bed, she grabbed her clothes and checked her living room. Thankfully, there on the couch was Jess sleeping quietly and on the cot in the corner was Charlotte. Both looked like they were sleeping deeply but both looked okay. Isabel breathed a sigh of relief and went about her morning.

About twenty minutes later her hair was brushed, her morning clothes were on, and she had started on breakfast. She had promised them a set of waffles and her mother’s good syrup if they helped her and that’s what they’d get. Both her friends woke up slowly during Isabel's puttering but all she could get out of them were giggles. A little irksome but whatever.

Eventually, breakfast was served. The girls ate their first few bites slowly and complemented both the waffles and the syrup. It was a saskatoon or juneberry or serviceberry syrup depending on where you are from. Had a bit of a sweet but tart flavour.

“Okay!” Isabel yelled, slamming down her fists into the table, “What’s going on? Why do you keep smiling at me?”

Both Jess and Charlotte lost it and burst out laughing at that. Sometimes they would try and half explain why but continued almost dry heaving through their amusement. 

“You two suck,” Isabel muttered.

“No, sorry Izzy,” Charlotte choked out but snorted and panickly added, “I don’t do that, I’ll spill your secret if you do.”

“What secret?” Isabel asked.

“You’re a Wereowl Izzy,” Jess laughed. Isabel frowned; she did not feel like that was something to laugh at. The Werewolf curse had killed hundreds, if not thousands over the years in this city alone. A Wereowl could fly, had sharper claws, and a beak!

“Not a Were curse Jess, she fully transformed,” Charlotte said through gasps, “you were so small.”

“Oh lord,” Jess added, “and your eyebrows. They are so cute.”

“This isn’t funny!” Isabel yelled again. It did have a noticeable effect until Jess pointed at her face and they both descended back into hysterics.

“We took a video,” Charlotte tried to say as she continued to laugh. Eventually finding her phone she pulled up multiple pictures and eventually the video. 

Isabel's eyes went wide seeing her form until both of her friends started laughing harder. In the pictures stood a large, yellow-eyed, aggressive-looking owl. Just like the feathers she always found she was mostly a beige colour with spots of brown. Her eyebrows though were quite pronounced and curved into a very obvious frown.

“Did I hurt you?” Isabel asked quickly, as she saw a scratch on Charlotte’s hand. The weird thing was she could almost half-remember it, “I didn’t give you the curse did I?”

“No Izzy,” Charlotte reassured quickly, “You have to be descended from someone that could transform. The Were curse keeps proportions and weight. Here just watch.”

Isabel picked Charlotte's phone up and saw, mostly to her horror, an incredibly perturbed-looking owl. A full owl though. She wasn’t a half woman half owl creature, which was good because then she wasn’t as dangerous. However, she let out the longest “aw “noise she could when Charlotte had moved the camera back.

Turns out most of the pictures and the beginning of the video were shot very close to her. She was a Whet Owl and stood less than a foot tall. Her form was mostly fluff, with large, perfectly round, yellow eyes. At least they were round when they weren’t frowning at the camera. 

In the video, Isabel had curled up into her pillow and was trying her best to rest as Jess and Charlotte whispered to each other. They kept bugging her though and Isabel gave this small but piercing screech at them. Charlotte tried to touch her. Isabel returned with a peck, scratching her hand, and a frown. They left her be after that.

“So whooo am I then?” Isabel asked as Charlotte took back her phone.

“Definitely not a Wereowl,” Charlotte said with a smile.

“So she’s an unaware owl?”
