Halls of carved stone, iron gates, silver sconces, and the jewelled-eyed statues only ever had the warmth of those around them. Empty the castle was frigid. With the Barrons of the outer kingdom here to celebrate the ratification of the peace treaty, the castle was as tepid as their forgotten water goblets to Princess Brianna. Short dirty blonde hair, once rarely brushed was now neatly styled and swayed as she marched away from the grand hall. 

Behind her jewelled, long light blue dress was her Knight. Noble born but as reckless as the Princess had been, Sir Malcolm tried his best to care about his new profession. He had led her through the war and returned as scarred as she was. Malcolm was one of the few who could remember the beauty before cold nights and swords took it from her. 

“Sir Malcolm?” Her Royal Highness asked softly after the two entered her quarters. Malcolm never called it a bedroom as it was about the size of the ship they had sailed on. “Why don’t they look at me like they do my mother?” 

Malcolm wished he could answer that question with the same unrefined, blunt honesty that the commoners loved her father for. The King, glory to him, had been one of the people. He was proudly uneducated, purposely extravagant, and, what some whispered, a willing pawn. Malcolm had worried his daughter would be the same.

War had done away with the poor, the unlucky, and those wanting change. The rich stayed rich. Those with true power made their deals and moved under the cover of masterfully crafted carriages into the country. All the while the cities were pillaged and burned. 

“Because you remind them of their future,” Malcolm answered carefully. He was her protector after all. Malcolm had seen the best and worst of her. With a reverend sigh, he explained, “You are the strength of this nation.”

“Isn’t that a good thing?” Princess Brianna's cold iron soul swung hard.

“It is,” Malcolm acknowledged.

“Then what’s wrong with me?” she seethed.

“Commoners, the people,” Malcolm quickly rephrased, then quietly added, “the courts.”

“I don’t care about the courts,” she snapped, “They wanted a war they didn’t understand, wouldn’t pay for, and couldn’t be bothered with went it turned. Now they don’t want to be responsible for the outcome. Why should I care about the courts?”

“I know Your Highness,” Malcolm said and swallowed hard at the memories they shared, “I wish I could tell you that you shouldn’t.”

“Don’t,” Brianna whispered, a sudden softness in her voice, “Don’t do that.”

Malcolm only nodded. The armour that he wore now was little more than decoration. Gold and silver to match the halls, emeralds to match the colours, and little floral etchings to match the gardens of the kingdom. He missed the comfort of his old uniform but he still wore his mask at times. 

“I’m sorry,” Malcolm whispered with a nod, “Look, Brianna, I knew you as the girl before you ran away. I knew the soldier, the spy, and the prisoner. They, the people, your people, know you sacrificed.”

“Isn’t that a good thing?” Brianna whispered as she stared out her window.

“They are scared you’ll want them to make the same sacrifice,” Malcolm explained.

“Shouldn’t they?” Brianna scoffed, giving Malcolm and his wisdom a sidelong glance before frowning at the city below her. Malcolm worried about her thoughts these last couple of weeks however much she played up her serenity. 

“Would you want to?” Malcolm asked.

Brianna looked up at the edge of the carved stone window sill and ran a hand across the scars that raked her sharp face. Malcolm could still hear her scream from when it happened in the quiet parts of the night. One would have hoped after a couple of years the memory would fade but it came in like an old friend searching for company. Malcolm could lock the door, drown his mind and it would still play for him, clear as day.

“You sacrificed your childhood to fight in a war that you had no business being in,” Malcolm continued, “You came back out of the shadows that had claimed men deemed gifted by the gods. I watched you march through the streets. You only saw the palace. The people saw that too and that purpose scares them.”

“So what?” Brianna scoffed, “I should drink like my father and flatter those fools like my mother? Merry some inbred prince? Is that how to be a good princess?”

“That’s how to be a populist,” Malcolm explained, shaking his head, “Idiots and cowards don’t like to be reminded of what they are. My suggestion is don’t be around either.”

“May have to find a new knight then,” Brianna teased.

“I swore an oath to protect you,” Malcolm argued, “I’d fire the man who let me get away with such a simple job out of a cannon.”

“Ah, you protect me from me,” Brianna chuckled and dismissively waved at Malcolm.

“Says the girl that put a dagger through a hole in my chainmail,” Malcolm said, shaking his head, “I can’t even protect myself from you.”

“Those were good times,” Brianna agreed.

“Not that I said that,” Malcolm explained, “I have faith you’ll build those times again,” 

“We’ll build them,” Brianna corrected, squinting at the city below she added, “Those idiots and cowards are going to help though.”

“Good girl,” Malcolm muttered with a mischievous smile. If anything, it was nice to hear her sound like she had found something of a purpose and he would kindle that flame as often as he could.
