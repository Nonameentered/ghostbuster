“You will never decode my masterpiece!” the booming voice yelled through the evil lairs intercom system. Lava, booby traps, and mind games abound this wicked hellscape. Computer screens followed me wherever I went. Blinding laser, tripwire, and pressure sensors littered the floor.

Weirdly enough, very few actual cameras though. The screens also sort of looked like those old square LCDs you would have seen in an office block ten or so years ago. Probably got them cheap. I’m not sure why this Baltharoanaxis was so high on himself if this was all he had. It was not like he knows where I am. I got out of his trap almost five minutes ago and he’s still going on and on about how cryptic it is.

The hallway in front of me, my path, potentially blocked by the swinging ceiling axes as the evil mastermind continued, “I have so many toys for you to die on.” By toys, he meant radical and dangerous instruments of death and destruction. All with one purpose; they were there to end my life.

None of them, and I really do mean none of them, were bolted to the ceiling properly. Fifteen years as a home inspector and you start to notice a lot of the shoddy work “brilliant” people do. One of the axes wasn’t even bolted to a supporting beam. It was honestly just there in the plaster. A light kick and it came crumbling down.

“Oh, hoho!” the voice boomed, the panels changing to a blood red colour, “You are a crafty one. No matter. The axes were merely a distraction. Better watch your step!”

He was of course referring to the horrendously installed pressure plates on the floor some ways back. They didn’t work. They weren’t actually given enough space to be recessed into the floor properly so the trap can’t be set off. Also, the blood red colour was cartoon blood red not dark crimson. Probably just got a RGB hex off some for the design site but missed it was for children's shows.

“You still alive my pretty little,” he was cackling into the mic as I walked into his control room. Door was just a push button and the code was 666. It was painted on all the walls. “Hey, how did you-”

I shot him in the face before he could continue.

“I have three teenage daughters!” I yelled at the corpse, “figuring out what they want for dinner is harder than the mysteries of this place.”
