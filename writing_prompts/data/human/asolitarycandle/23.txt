Three years of scrubbing floors, to scrubbing pots, to scrubbing armour, Vos finally was allowed to tag along on an adventure. Time and again he had proven himself faithful but time and again his green scales left a shadow of doubt in the minds of men and mer alike. From friends to fae, Vos wasn’t allowed a sliver of faith without first being nearly assaulted for fear that he would find the dragon within himself.

As a porter, he felt he was finally making headway. Men would give him swords to sharpen, leather to stitch, and food to cook. Vos stayed safe behind the action and the fighting with his claws at the ready but never sharpened enough to scare his companions. He was happy. He thought he was happy. The small steps forward into a larger that Vos was taking would hopefully turn his matte finish into an emerald shine.

Cook camps, bandit raids, and a rather uncomfortable necromancer push Vos forward. Zombies were scary to the tiny, three-foot, forty-pound bipedal lizard but the smell of them would haunt his memories forever. Well, there was a guy in the back alley he met much later but we’ll get to that. 

The dark wizard at the end of that journey had turned out to be a feeble little thing. A jagged crystal on a pillar of cracked and broken black glass pulsated with shivering waves of energy. Vos felt its evil before they entered. The man though, the man was barely a skeleton himself spouting tales of cloud-touch castles, music boxes, and horseless carriages. Vos could smell fragrant fungi in the room and tried his best to ignore the wild tails of the city of light and sound.

No matter what he did, it stayed with him regardless of how he tried. Day by day, Vos thought more and more of the endless path of taverns, the smell of acrid smoke, and towers that touched the clouds. What a world that would be. Peaceful, for no building that tall would ever hold up in a time of war. Vos thought to himself that he could make it if he was there among so many. 

Time came and hope bestowed a gift to the little lizard that he dared not dream of. He was to be the porter that went with the scouts as he had served fast and faithfully enough to keep up and keep out of sight. Vos beamed and hugged himself in the closet after he was told so that he could stay out of eyesight. 

Boss wasn’t a nice man to Vos. In the closet, Vos had heard him quietly confide that Vos had been the best choice to his right-hand man. That made him smile. Boss said if Vos was successful, he’d be easy to pay and if he wasn’t, well nothing of value would have been lost. That was less nice in Vos’ mind. No worse for wear as a job’s a job’s a job to Vos. Always had been.

“Vos!” a spikey, multicoloured-haired man yelled in the packed, stone-like building that Vos now found himself in, “I need a Dragon Special!”

“On it!” Vos happily yelled back and got to work on the screaming tubes that he now worked. They never sounded happy but even when Vos tried his best to polish them up they always howled like a branded fowl. 

Stares of wonder and curiosity covered the grey stone behind them as Vos worked. He couldn’t help but smile. He lived now with an interest in creatures that used to mistrust him. Music like he never could have afforded in his long life now flooded every waking moment he had. Spices that he never knew existed wafted through his senses, medicine he’d never believed would work relieved his aches, and home, his own actual home, had a lock so intricate he felt like a king. 

He was now worth protecting.

Before all of that, before the little white Aspiring tablets and the king's orchestras in the ceiling, Vos got ready in a wooden room he shared with the mutts that the boss called dogs. The smell had bothered Vos before he had met Gale, the necromancer in his crumbling castle, but liked he wasn’t bothered often. By often he meant more than a few times a day or only a couple of times at night.

“Vosh!” Boss yelled from the armoury, “Where yeur at?”

“Just getting suited up!” Vos yelled back, “I’ll be there!”

Vos quickly got his leather on, mostly to distribute the weight correctly across his tiny body better than the straps of the packs he was going to carry. Jumping up and out of the room, a large, stained sac hit the floor just in front of him without a word. Boss didn’t stay to see Vos pick it up nor did he say anything to instruct or encourage. Good old Boss, Vos thought that Boss didn’t need to tell him any of that. 

Vos was strong, in his own mind, maybe not in body but in soul and spirit. He would rise without wings or fire to sit on a throne of his own making. His gold was his achievement. Most of them were paid in silver sadly but it was what it was. Nothing would keep Vos from the story that crazy, smelly man had told. Even if it wasn’t true, it was something Vos needed to see for himself.
