Thank you so much. I'm finding writing these shorter pieces quite difficult so it's nice to know that people are enjoying them. A lot of what I'm doing is writing my idea out fully first, then trimming it way down, and then expanding it out again until I can get the word count.

The full line was, "With the cold glass in my hands, the floor suddenly felt like I was walking on eggshells under his gaze. The shame of it made me wish for razor blades. I didn't want to make this worse but I knew I couldn't make it better. At that moment, I doubt I'd know the difference." 

I probably should have just cut the entire thing but there was something about the walking on eggshells and walking on razor blade comparison that hit home for me. 

Looking at the word count now and the misspelling of eggshells, I could have also had, "Walking on eggshells or razor blades," and still have been good.
