“Your Highness,” Marabelle squicked as the three women rode through the nearly untouched mountain wilderness. The scent of the pine trees had filled them for the last two days of travel as it got ever-increasingly present. Nothing wanted to be here. Nothing wanted to live here but one creature. Looking around at the undisturbed wilderness, Marabelle whispered, “Your Highness, it’s not my place but are we sure we should be so close to Veloth’s liar?”

“Well, we are going there,” Princess Elizabeth, fourth of her name, explained plainly now that they were away from the common rabble and peasants.

“Wait, what? No, your Highness? What was that?” Marabelle blurted out in a panic, “You didn’t mean. I don’t believe I heard you quite right. Did you? Are we?”

Turning her horse around and giving a stern look to the slightly overweight woman in front of her, Princess Elizabeth tried her best to have patience. The older, thinner woman beside her, Fran, was a lot more level headed but then again Fran had always known the kingdom's agreement with Veloth. Marabelle was flighty but well-read and educated. She was a proper lady to the court. 

“May my mother never hear such a jumble or she will question you teaching me my letters,” Elizabeth almost chuckled as she shook her head, “My Marabelle, it’s okay. Veloth isn’t what he seems.”

“A dragon?” Marabelle more stated than asked.

“Well, no, he is that,” Elizabeth acknowledged, “but he’s not the dragon everyone thinks he is.”

“Princess, I have seen him murder and burn our kingdom,” Marabelle argued loudly, “What in the Light's name are you doing here. You of all people should not be here. He will capture you again as he has before.”

“Most likely,” Elizabeth scoffed and shook her head, “and my father will pay him his wage disguised as a ransom payment once again.”

“Your Highness,” Marabelle coughed out in outrage, “How dare you say such things. The King would not say such a thing. If he hears about this you will be disowned.”

“Blame Fran,” Elizabeth said as she turned her horse around, “It was her idea back when it was my mother.”

“She lies so easily,” Elizabeth heard Marabelle mutter behind her.

“I ‘old yah, we aughten have brought ‘er,” Fran called from the back, “too much excitement.”

“DeLanny said it would look suspicious if we didn’t bring her,” Elizabeth called back, now ignoring the muttering old maid in the middle.

“‘ow much further?” Fran asked.

“Hour or two up the mountain,” Elizabeth explained as she moved her horse around a fairly dense part of the bush. Last time, this route had been a lot less cluttered but then again that had been two years ago now. With a sigh, she tried to remember how far the river was from here. It wasn’t as direct a route but it would be easier riding on the stony shores. Pointing west, she added, “It might be easier if we cut directly to White Water than go through this.”

“Easier to get to the dragon,” Marabelle quickly mocked, “I’m going to be eaten without a thought or a care.”

“You’ll be fine,” Elizabeth argued, “We had planned an attack two months ago. I was going to stay with him to continue my study on Bilsbed in peace for a while.”

“That beast isn’t tutoring you is he?” Marabelle asked quietly.

“No,” Elizabeth answered on instinct but hedged with, “Well we talk, he’s quite old so it’s interesting to hear what he’s lived through.”

“He’s corrupting you,” Marabelle whispered to herself, “A beast would do that.”

“Please stop calling him a beast,” Elizabeth sighed as she rounded another dense pack of trees, “Veloth has a hard time hearing that word.”

“I’ll call him what he is,” Marabelle argued, “And what he is, is a-“

A loud crash and a thunderous roar cut her off as the three turned in panic to look up at the mountain. Something had hit the bare rock of the mountain hard. A wave less than a second later shook them and their horses as a push of dust swept passed them. Elizabeth couldn’t see where it had come from or why. 

The three women looked at each other hesitantly after they calmed their horses down. Fran offered a couple of rather descriptive possibilities of what could have happened but Elizabeth explained that Veloth didn’t have anything necessary in his horde. If he had been a human, Elizabeth could easily have called him an ironworker. The dragon loved making sculptures and his cave was filled with all his little creations.

From Elizabeth’s time with the dragon when she was eleven and then again when she was sixteen, Veloth kept most of his works to the size of a table. This crash shook them. It would have been something like a house or larger in Elizabeth’s mind to make that sort of effect.

They continued after a couple of minutes when nothing else seemed to disturb the forest. Much to Marabelle horror and against all of her protests. Nothing was heard though. A soft, forlorn cry to Elizabeth’s ears went out about an hour later but again, after stopping and Marabelle complaining, the three continued on. 

The White Water River was a blessed sight as the three pushed out of the brush and into the open riverbank of stone and sand. Taking a small break, the three filled their waterskins in the icy cold river but didn’t talk. Elizabeth worried that Marabelle would do something stupid but her nurse had her orders. Marabelle had been told by the Queen herself that she was to follow Elizabeth on her journey. Hopefully, that would be enough.

When they finally reached the cliffside that Veloth had his cave on, Elizabeth recognized what could have caused the crash. The path was broad, easily allowing three horses to ride side by side regardless of whether anyone actually would do such a thing. Falling off the edge was not something anyone would want to contemplate but the access was easy enough that if Veloth needed a wagon brought to him, it would easily be done. The only problem had been the boulder at his entrance, now suspiciously missing, that Veloth had used to keep out the evening sun.

“Your Highness,” Marabelle hissed as Elizabeth got off her horse and tied to the edge of the mountain, “You can’t be serious. Get back on your horse!”

Ignoring her, Elizabeth walked to the entrance way to take a look at the hole that the boulder had left. Why had he gotten rid of it? Taking a glance off the cliff she could see the remains of the now exploded boulder littering the forest below. Shards had taken out more than a couple of trees.

Sighing to herself, she turned around to peer inside the cave only to quickly jump back out the sight of the entrance. Two dragons loomed inside. One, obviously Veloth. His large amber scales and black horns were not hard to miss but the other was a significantly larger dragon of the same colouration. Veloth had this hollow look in his eyes as the other went through his sculptures. 

Waving the other two women back and away, Elizabeth pocked her head back into the entrance to see if she could see more. Veloth saw her though, his eyes going wide and glanced at the other dragon in panic. Elizabeth moved back and waited, not sure if this was an intruder or what. She had never really asked anything about how he dealt with other members of his kind and human stories were utterly worthless.
