Hello everyone, I’m not new but I am fairly quiet. Been on and off Reddit and WritingPrompts for the last few years and in that time I have read, written, and deleted a lot. I love reading stories but actually posting has been difficult. Back in January though, I decided to just start submitting, usually while holding my breath, and letting my anxiety be what it is. It has been a terrifying but positive experience and I am deeply grateful for it.

I give myself at least fifteen minutes to think about the prompt and up to an hour. In that time, I usually research names and a bit of lore around the elements that I want to use. If the prompt touches on something I like it’s usually easier to think about and what a basic structure could look like. With that being said, I have written multiple prompts on a break at work and I know they are ultra-troped and basic because of it.
