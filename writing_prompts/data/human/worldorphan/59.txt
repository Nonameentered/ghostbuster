“If I must use the last of my strength, I will defeat you!” Bradoc declared. The old man stared, slightly winded, at his adversary, and massaged his sore hands. The pickle jar sat impassively on the table, its lid stuck as tightly as ever.

Someone knocked on his door. He opened it to find four people, a tall woman in armor, her tabard bearing the design of the Lady of Green Fields, a short man in dark robes with an impressive array of pouches and oddments hanging from his belt, a thin woman in tight gray leathers with a surprising number of knives strapped to various parts of her body, and a woman with a violin and brightly colored clothing. Bradoc recognized an adventuring party when he saw one. That had been his life, once upon a time.

“What do you want?”

“Are you Bradoc the Valiant?” the priestess asked him.

He nodded slowly. “It's been a long time since anyone called me that.” He showed them into his home.

“I'm Lorelei,” the priestess introduced herself. “This is Natsuko, Zaharis, and Tasmyne,” she indicated the thief, the wizard, and the bard, in that order. She pulled a long bundle wrapped in cloth from her back, laid it on the table. “Sir, do you recognize this?” She pulled aside the fabric to reveal a sword.

Bradoc stared at the golden cross-guard made to look like feathered wings, the white jewel on the pommel, and the magic runes inscribed on the blade. “The Vigilant Angel Sword,” he whispered. “Yes, I know this blade. But where did you get it? And why are you bringing it to me now?”

“The Lady of Green Fields showed me a vision of this sword,” Lorelei explained. “And once we found the sword, in a tomb in Southaven, she showed me a vision of you.”

“That can't be right,” Bradoc protested. “I wielded that blade once, but that was a long time ago. I'm retired now.”

“Please,” said Tasmyne, the bard. “We know the legends. This sword was forged for the purpose of slaying the Demon Lord Vezroloth. If the blade is awakening, that must mean that the Demon Lord has returned. And it looks like you are called once again to fight him.”

Bradoc glanced at the pickle jar. He shook his head. “I can't help you,” he said, bitterly. “I fought the Demon Lord once. I lost my right eye in that fight.” He traced the scar on his face with a finger. “I lost my best friend, too. No. I did my part against him. I've done enough. It's someone else's turn.”

“You're just scared that you're too old to fight him,” Natsuko, the thief, quipped.

“Damn right I'm too old! Look . . .”

Tasmyne picked up the sword by the cloth it had been wrapped in, and thrust it toward him. Instinctively, he grasped the handle before it could thump into his chest. A rush of tingling warmth spread from his hands to the rest of his body. The aches and pains of forty years of life suddenly faded. His shoulders straightened with newfound strength. He stared in wonder at the sword. Then, stepping back, he brandished it in a wide swing. His arms still remembered how to wield it, and his hands, no longer arthritic, gripped it firmly.

“How?” he gasped.

“Master Bradoc,” Zaharis said respectfully, “the Southlands abound with rumors of monsters terrorizing the countryside, and a wicked lord taking up residence in the Tower of Fangs. Surely, this is the rebirth of Vezroloth, that was prophesied years ago. If Lorelei has interpreted her goddess's will correctly, you have been chosen to fight him one more time.”

“And we would be proud to fight at your side,” Tasmyne added.

Bradoc nodded. “Yes. Yes, of course I'll fight.” Sword still in hand, he started toward his bedroom to gather his old adventuring gear. Then, he looked back at the kitchen table. He was going on an epic quest. He would prove that he still had what it took to be a hero, to defend the innocent and stand against evil and tyranny.

But first, he thought, flexing his once-again strong fingers, he was going to have a pickle.
