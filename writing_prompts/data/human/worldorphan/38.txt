**The Chester Inn Hustle**
  

  
One fine spring afternoon in Jonesborough, Tennessee, Betsy Cox was serving the patrons of the Chester Inn. She'd been working there to support her family ever since her brothers died in the war, one buried wearing Union blue, the other wearing Confederate gray.
  

  
The newcomer, Dr. Leonidas Burke, was a tall, handsome fellow of distinguished age. Originally from Rhode Island, he'd just arrived on the train, and was cheerfully telling the locals how much he admired their beautiful mountain town.
  

  
The only guests not engaging the gregarious Dr. Burke were also visitors to Jonesborough. One was Douglas Moody, who'd arrived a week ago. He was the most infirm man Betsy had ever seen up and walking around. His face was pale and drawn, his hair lank and stringy. He wasn't old, but he walked with a cane, and had a nasty cough. Betsy, though, suspected some of his illness was a sham, just like his phony Kentucky accent. His disinterest in Dr. Burke was a sham as well, she was certain.
  

  
Then there was Jim Weaver, a solitary fellow from parts unknown. He sat in a corner and glowered at  Burke and Moody when they weren't looking.
  
The next day, Dr. Burke erected a tent on the lawn beside the inn. “Burke's Salubrious Elixir!” he proclaimed to the crowd. “A cure for any and every ailment! Headaches, toothaches, and backaches; rheumatism, gout, and lumbago. Maladies of the liver, kidneys, and bowels.  If taken daily, it prevents diphtheria, cholera, and whooping cough. The world is shrinking, ladies and gentlemen! The elixir's secret formula combines the latest medical innovations of Europe with mystic ingredients from the Chinese Empire!”
  

  
He went on, expounding the virtues of Burke's Salubrious Elixir. Finally he asked the crowd, who would buy a bottle? There was silence; then Douglas Moody stepped forward.
  

  
“Right you are, my good man!” encouraged Dr. Burke as money changed hands. “Take some now, at supper, and at bedtime. Then come back tomorrow and tell everyone how you're getting on.”
  

  
The following morning, Mr. Moody was indeed looking much improved. He'd foregone his cane, and his face had lost its pallor and pained expression. Even his hair was sleeker, although Betsy wondered if that was because she'd spied him washing it.
  

  
At the doctor's tent, Moody rapturously ascribed his recovery to Burke's Salubrious Elixir. Upon seeing this transformation, other townsfolk eagerly purchased the nostrum. Dr. Burke performed medical examinations for his audience, then sold bottles of elixir to cure the ills he revealed. Betsy's own mother was diagnosed with exhaustion, chlorosis, and dropsy of the ankles. A daily dose of elixir was guaranteed to set her right.
  

  
Later that afternoon, the celebrated doctor was approached by a man Betsy didn't recognize.  “Doc,” he begged, “you gotta help me! I've a fever so terrible I could scarce get out of bed.” His hands shook as he shoved sweaty hair from his face. “I got a rash, too, look!”
  

  
Dr. Burke made a show of looking the man over, then declared, “Sir, you have a serious case of typhus fever! Without treatment, you could be dead by tomorrow. Here sir, have a bottle of my elixir, at half price. Take three swallows, then stay in bed for the rest of the day. I promise you'll be cured by morning.”
  

  
“Hmm,” said the stranger. “Dr. Cunningham?”
  

  
The crowd gasped as the town physician came forward to examined the stranger. “This man has no fever whatsoever. His sweat is just water. As for his rash, it appears something has dyed his skin.”
  

  
“It's pokeberry juice,” supplied the stranger. 
  

  
“Ah. Well, sir, anyone with an ounce of medical training could tell there's not a thing wrong with you.”
  

  
“Dr. Burke!” the man shouted, “I declare you to be a fraud!” With a tug, he removed a wig and a fake mustache, and there stood Jim Weaver. “After Dr. Leonidas Burke came to my hometown in Pennsylvania,” he told the crowd, “several people nearly died of poisoning from too much of his elixir. Our clash was inevitable.”
  

  
“Now see here,” protested Dr. Burke, but Jim went on.
  

  
“Burke's Elixir contains nothing but alcohol, opium, and a little ginseng. It can't cure a thing, although it's quite habit-forming. As for the miraculous healing of Mr. Moody? He's from Rhode Island, not Kentucky, and he's Burke's brother-in-law. I have proof!” He produced a tintype, a family portrait with Burke and Moody together. “They've been swindling their way along the Appalachians for nearly a year.”
  

  
The good people of Jonesborough surrounded the two rapscallions before they could absquatulate, and the next morning found them tarred, feathered, and run out on a rail. Betsy watched them go from the porch of the Chester Inn, train smoke mingling with the sweet scent of dogwood blossoms.
