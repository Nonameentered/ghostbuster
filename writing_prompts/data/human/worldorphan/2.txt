I'm not doing NaNoWriMo exactly. My goal is to edit my whole novel by the end of the month. This will be my third-ish draft. I've gone through the entire thing and made notes of all the things I want to fix or add. It should then be ready to send to a second round of test readers and based on their feedback, maybe query it to the publishers. Fingers crossed.
