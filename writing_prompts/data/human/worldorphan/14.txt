Just thought I'd mention I got to use my Reddit skills at work the other day. We have a new web app for incident reporting, and the "event description" box only accepts 1,000 characters. Of course my response was longer than that. So here I am at work, cutting out words like its SEUS and my story's too long again, and Cody's gonna get me if I go over the word count. 

You guys are the best!
