**Love and Donkeys (Disney's Encanto, from a different POV)**
  

  
“Senor Lopez, the donkeys got out again,” Juan said at breakfast.
  

  
My father nodded. “I'll ask Luisa to bring them back.”
  

  
Luisa Madrigal and her family were the glue that held our town together. They'd been blessed by a miracle, years ago, when Pedro Madrigal had sacrificed himself to save his town from soldiers. Each of the Madrigals possessed a magical gift. Luisa's was superhuman strength.
  

  
My heart fluttered. While most young men in the village were smitten with the graceful and perfect Isabella Madrigal, my crush was on her older sister Luisa. Tall and brawny, with rippling muscles, solid curves, and a nice, tight . . .
  

  
“You know, Dad,” I said, shaking myself, “Luisa has so much work to do, lifting, carrying, building. I heard the Sanchez family asked her to re-route the river today. Why don't Juan and I round up the donkeys?”
  

  
“Nonsense, Oscar. I need you to oversee the planting in the west field. You're going to run this farm yourself one day.”
  

  
“At least let me repair that gate . . .”
  

  
“I'd think you'd want the donkeys getting out as often as possible, Oscar,” my sister teased.
  

  
Blushing furiously, I was suddenly in a hurry to get to the west field.
  

  
Luisa arrived around noon, carrying six donkeys on her back. I could tell something was wrong. Her smile seemed forced, and her left eye twitched.
  

  
"Are you all right?"
  

  
"I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be fine?" She said, a little too fast. She effortlessly tossed a donkey into the pen. It gave her a reproving look.
  

  
I held the gate open for her. "You don't have to work so hard, you know."
  

  
"That's what my little sister said. So I tried to do less, but I'm getting behind!" As she set down the last two donkeys, she staggered, as if they were actually heavy. A horrified look crossed her face, and she bolted without another word.




That night, disaster struck. The Guzmans fled a dinner party at the Madrigal house amidst cracking walls and a torrential indoor rain storm. They told everyone how the Madrigals' magical gifts were out of control. My father and some others went to talk to Alma Madrigal, the family matriarch, about the magic, but she insisted everything was fine.
  

  
It was not fine. The wind howled and the earth shook. The Madrigal house was reduced to rubble. The magic that had protected our town for three generations had failed.
  

  
The next morning, I wasn't surprised to discover that the donkeys had gotten out again. I went to round them up, but instead found Luisa, bawling her eyes out. I sat down beside her, my usual shyness evaporating in the face of her misery.
  

  
“What am I going to do?” she said. “My powers are gone. My house is destroyed. My little sister ran off. I was supposed to hold everything together, and I failed!”
  

  
I put my hand on hers. “Even without your powers, Luisa, you're still the strongest woman I know. And you have the biggest heart. Things will turn around,” I said. “And until they do, your family will need your strength, your real strength, more than ever.”
  

  
She sniffed and dried her eyes. Then she left to keep searching for her missing sister.
  

  
I felt a twinge of guilt watching her go. Poor Luisa. But what could I do? I was just one person, and I certainly didn't have any magic powers. 
  

  
Then it hit me.
  

  
It took less than half an hour to gather most of the town in front of the remains of the Madrigal's house. Working together, we rebuilt it, better than before. I watched Luisa from a distance. I wanted to talk with her again, but with her whole family there, I couldn't see a way.
  

  
It seemed that the whole town coming together was a sort of miracle itself, because as soon as the house was rebuilt, the Madrigal family got their gifts back. There was an impromptu celebration, with music and dancing. I wanted to dance with Luisa, but I was too shy to ask her.
  

  
Feeling let down, I was heading home, when I heard amused swearing behind me. I looked back, and there was one of my renegade donkeys. It had Luisa's skirt in its teeth and was pulling her in my direction. Something large and soft nudged me from behind. A second donkey pushed me toward Luisa. Someone giggled. Hiding in the bushes were Luisa's two sisters, as well as her cousin Dolores, that gossip-girl with the superhuman hearing, and her cousin Antonio, who could talk to animals.
  

  
Luisa and I looked at them, at the donkeys, and at each other. Then we burst out laughing. Maybe it was time for a new story.
