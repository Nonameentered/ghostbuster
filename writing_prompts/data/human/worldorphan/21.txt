**Abandoned Mall**

"I can't believe my parents took away my TV, computer, video games, *and* canceled the data plan on my phone!" Livy lamented.
  

  
"My mom must've talked to your mom," Jacob said, "because she did the exact same thing, and she would never have thought of the data plan thing on her own."
  

  
"I don't know why they're freaking out so much. We only cheated on *one* test. It's not like we were doing drugs or something."
  

  
"Hey, here we are."
  

  
"Duh. It's kinda hard to miss, giant abandoned shopping mall and all that."
  

  
“When did it close?” Jacob asked. “Do you remember?”
  

  
“Eight years ago, maybe? There's a picture of me with Santa Claus that was taken here. From before Dad left us. How about you? Did you ever come here when you were little?”
  

  
“Yeah we used to go to the movie theater. It was weird because most of the other stores were empty.”  

  
"Hey," Livy said. "You were right. The lock's broken."
  

  
"Whoa. It's creepy in here."
  

  
"Watch out. There's water on the floor."
  

  
"Gross. Don't touch the walls, either. There's mold."
  

  
“Look at this tree. It's so dry. Like it's gonna turn to dust if I touch it.”
  

  
"Huh. What's that over there?" Jacob asked.
  

  
"It's a fountain. It looks so weird without any water in it."
  

  
"Check out these mannequins!"
  

  
"Ugh. I hate the ones that don't have faces!"
  

  
"Do you think any of these stores still have stuff in them?"
  

  
"Nah. Anything worth taking is long gone by now."
  

  
"Dude! Are these pay-phones?"
  

  
"Yeah. They're so, like, *antiquated*." Livy giggled.
  

  
"It's so dark. It's like the darkness is looming over everything. With all these skylights you'd think it would be brighter. They must be really filthy on the outside."
  

  
"Hey Jacob? I, uh, I know it's none of my business, but we could hear your parents fighting last night. I think the whole street heard."
  

  
Jacob sighed heavily. "My dad lost his job."
  

  
"Oh no!"  

  
"He says the company's losing money and laying off workers at random, but Mom said it's because he goes into work hung-over all the time."
  

  
"Does he?"
  

  
"Probably. He's usually hammered by the time I go to bed. He's totally an alcoholic, just like Grandpa after the steel plant closed. At least he doesn't beat the crap out of me and Mom like Grandpa used to do to Dad and Grandma. Geez, can we talk about something else?"
  
“Um . . . Oh! Look over there! It's all green.”
  

  
“The tree's dead, but all these weeds have taken over the planter. How are they alive?”
  

  
“The skylight's broken. There's actually some sunshine.”
  

  
“Cool.”
  

  
“Wanna check out the theater?”
  

  
“Sure.”
  

  
Livy gagged as the door creaked open. “Oh, gross! It smells like something died in here!” 
  
“The seats are all decayed. Yuck. Let's look upstairs. We passed an escalator. Think it's safe?”
  

  
“Rusted and crumbly. I don't know.”
  

  
“I'll go first.”
  

  
“Be careful, Jacob.”
  

  
“It's okay. Come on,”
  

  
“Somebody really went to town with the graffiti up here.”
  

  
“Check out this one. *A serious house on serious earth*. What's that supposed to mean?”
  

  
“How should I know?”
  

  
“What was that?” Jacob's voice suddenly pitched a little too high.
  

  
“What?”
  

  
“Did you see that shadow? The way it moved -”
  

  
“Stop it, Jacob. You're scaring me.”
  

  
“I'm not . . . Oh hey, more mannequins.”
  

  
“Now you really *are* trying to scare me. Yeesh! Look at them all, lying there.” 
  

  
“Like somebody murdered a bunch of Barbie and Ken dolls.”
  

  
Livy shuddered. “Creepy faceless Barbie and Ken dolls. Ugh! They're all *dismembered*. I've gotta get out of here.”
  

  
“Let's check out the elevator. The doors are open on this floor.”
  

  
“Whoa. You can see down the shaft. It looks so deep. But it can't be. There's only two floors.”
  

  
“Do you feel that? Like something breathing.”
  

  
“It's like something's alive down there. What's the word? *Dwelling*. Something's *dwelling* in there.” 
  

  
“W-what's that? Do you hear that moaning? Tell me it's the wind or something.”
  

  
“How could there be any wind down there?” Livy choked. “What's that smell?”
  

  
“Oh, god . . . Let's go!”
  

  
“Jacob. The mannequins -”
  

  
“Have they moved? They seem closer.” 
  

  
“I can't stay up here.”
  

  
“Nope.”
  

  
“Jacob? Wasn't the fountain empty before?”
  

  
“The water – it's so dark.”
  

  
“It's bubbling. Oh, gross! What is that?”
  

  
“Maybe we should leave.”
  

  
Livy screamed. “Oh god! A mannequin arm! Where'd it come from?”
  

  
“I don't wanna know. Come on!” 
  

  
“The exit! It's stuck!”
  

  
“The mannequins! They're -”
  

  
“Run!”
  

  
“This way! The door by the broken skylight!”
  

  
“It's open. Jacob hurry!”
  

  
“Livy! Look out! The sign!”
  

  
“Well, nobody's getting in or out that door again.” 
  

  
“We're lucky we weren't crushed!”
  

  
“It's getting late. See you tomorrow?”
  

  
“Yeah. But no more adventures.”
