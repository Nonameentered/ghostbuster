**Reversal**
  

  

  
“Ooh, look! An antique store!” Paige pointed out the car window. The weathered building sat just off the side of the back road we were taking through the Appalachian Mountains.
  

  
“We're going camping, not shopping,” I teased.
  

  
“We can do both.”
  

  
I pulled into the gravel parking lot. Inside, the place was a disorganized clutter of furniture and collectibles, from the exquisite to the cheap. Paige examined a diaphanous wedding dress, while I admired a shelf of  glassware.
  

  
“Anna, come look at this,” Paige called. She'd found a freestanding full-length mirror with an ornately carved frame. “It's beautiful.”
  

  
“It's three hundred dollars,” I pointed out. The mirror was in rough shape, the frame nicked and dented. “Also, the glass is cracked.” 
  

  
Paige, bold as brass, went up to the counter and addressed the proprietor. “Hey, this mirror is broken. You don't expect us to pay full price for something like that, do you?”
  

  
The old man smirked at the college girl trying to haggle. “What's your offer, then?”
  

  
“Um, two hundred?”
  

  
“Sold.”
  

  
We drove for another forty-five minutes through the forest to our campsite. There wasn't another soul around for miles. We set up our tent, then unloaded the rest of our gear. 
  

  
“Ouch!” I sliced my finger on the cracked mirror, which we'd laid flat in the bed of the SUV. Blood dripped onto the glass and the frame. I thought I would have to deterge it pretty hard to get the stain out, but when I returned after bandaging my finger, there was no trace of blood. Weird. 
  

  
Paige and I grilled hotdogs and marshmallows over the campfire, then stayed up late telling spooky stories. At last, we crawled happily into our tent.
  

  
That night, I had a vivid dream that Paige and I were looking into the antique mirror. The whorled designs I'd taken for flowers now resembled demonic faces. We could only see one person reflected in it, and it was neither of us.
  

  
I awoke the next morning with a touch of vertigo. I attributed it to a poor night's sleep on the ground. But as the day went on, I couldn't shake an unsettling feeling. 
  

  
We went for a long morning hike. Paige took the lead. We'd done this hike many times on previous trips, but every time we came to a fork in the trail, she took the opposite direction from what I was expecting. Yet somehow the hike took the same amount of time as always. It just didn't line up.
  

  
I couldn't stop thinking that something was off about Paige. She had a small scar on her cheek, from falling off her bike when we were nine. I was sure it had been the left cheek. But now the scar was on the right. Her hair, too, was parted on the wrong side. Wasn't it? 
  

  
I remembered all the movies I'd seen where a person got replaced by an alien or monstrous copy. Then I told myself not to be absurd. Still, all afternoon I kept testing Paige, asking her about things that both of us knew. It turned into a fun jaunt down memory lane, and after a while, I stopped feeling suspicious. 
  

  
After supper, Paige got out her journal.
  

  
A chill ran down my spine. “Since when are you left-handed?”
  

  
“What?”
  

  
“Paige, you're writing with the wrong hand.”
  

  
“What? This is the hand I always write with. Anna, are you feeling okay?”
  

  
My heart stopped as she shifted and I saw what she'd been writing. All of the words, all of the letters, were backwards.
  

  
I had to get away from her. From it. From the thing that had replaced my best friend. I bolted for the SUV, dove into the driver's seat, and fumbled to get the key into the ignition. Impossibly, the steering wheel was on the wrong side, like a British car.
  

  
Then Paige was banging on the window. “Anna! What's wrong?”
  

  
I tried to lock the door, but was too slow. She opened it, and reached for me. I punched her. She grabbed my arm and pulled me from the vehicle. I fell, striking the ground face first. 
  

  
I raised my head. Something was wrong with my vision. A not-quite-vertical line ran down the right side of it. I tried to brush whatever it was out of my eye. My fingers encountered a sharp edge.
  

  
Paige stared, eyes wide. Then she screamed.
  

  
I threw open the back of the SUV so I could see myself in Paige's mirror. A spiderweb of cracks marred the right side of my forehead, with a long fracture running through my eye and down my cheek. Like broken glass. There was no blood, only a faint glow underneath. 
  

  
I reached up to pull the pieces apart . . .
