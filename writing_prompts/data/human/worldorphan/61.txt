They moved slowly through the mad city, leaving a trail of order in their wake. Melinda checked her tablet every few feet, trying to triangulate Hathaway's position based on some magical energy detected by her gadgets. Of the people around them, half were panicking, and half were stubbornly trying to go about their business despite the insanity around them. A man coming out of a shop and cursing about something or other bumped into Kendall and dropped his change. All the coins landed on heads.
  

  
Orville noticed. “The pattern anomaly around you is getting stronger. That's a good sign, I think.”
  

  
They reached an outdoor cafe, and Orville signaled for them to halt. A man in his late twenties, heavy-set and rumpled-looking, sat at a table, his head in his hands.
  

  
Orville called out, “Gabe Hathaway, you are under arrest by order of the Magical Protections Division!”
  

  
Gabe (after seeing him, Kendall could only think of him as Gabe; he radiated too much loser to be a Mr. Hathaway) laughed bitterly. “You order me? Order? There is no order here, only chaos.” To prove his point, a bird crashed into a window above them and splatted on the ground beside him. 
  

  
Orville took a step forward and raised his hands in a strange gesture. Light began to form between his fingers. Gabe shot to his feet and made a gesture of his own. Green energy leapt from his hands and struck Orville. A blue light surrounded him, absorbing most of Gabe's spell, but he was still thrown backwards to crash into a table.
  

  
“My life doesn't make any sense,” Gabe moaned. “Why should anything at all make sense?”
  

  
Orville untangled himself from the chairs he's knocked over and sent a bolt of energy, like yellow lightning, back at Gabe. The slovenly wizard deflected it with a spell, and sent it into a parked car, which exploded. It's stereo landed in the middle of the patio, and started playing country music. Kendall took a step toward it, and it stopped.
  

  
“She lied to me! She said she was too busy with work to go out with me. But I followed her, and what was she doing? Going on vacation in New York! With him!” He stamped, rather petulantly, on the ground, and the earth buckled, making them all stagger. A pipe burst somewhere below them, sending a fountain of water shooting up through the pavement.
  

  
“Wait a minute,” Kendall said. “This is about a girl?”
  

  
Gabe seemed to notice her for the first time. “Not just any girl. The girl. My girl. She knew how I felt about her. But she . . .”
  

  
“So you're telling us,” Kendall said, “that this, all this, is because you couldn't get a date?”
  

  
“She left my heart in chaos! She ruined my world! Now she knows how it feels! Wherever she goes, I'll be there, cursing her!”
  

  
“Oh, for Pete's sake! If all you want is for a girl to go out with you, hell, I'll go out with you! Just make this stop!”
  

  
“Wait, what?” The flickering neon sign above his head suddenly turned off. “But don't you think I'm lame? Or ugly? Or . . .”
  

  
Kendall shrugged. “Well, you're a bit of a psycho. But you're kind of cute, in a dorky way. And you can do magic. That's pretty cool.”
  

  
Across the Square, the LED billboards all went dark, then began displaying advertisements like they were supposed to. The traffic lights started turning from green to yellow to red in an orderly fashion.
  

  
“One date. That's all I'm promising. And don't expect anything to get physical. You take me out to dinner and a movie, nothing else. And if it goes badly, or even if it goes well, and you try something funny, I'm gonna have these fine folks from the government on speed dial, got it?” She stepped up next to him, and put a hand on his shoulder.
  

  
“Orville,” Melinda said, “readings show the chaos magic dying down. At the rate it's going, in an hour or so, it will be completely dissipated. It's over.”
  

  
Orville brushed off his clothes and straightened his tie. “Well done, all,” he said stiffly. He turned to Gabe. “You're still under arrest, you know. But I'm sure we can make arrangements for that date.”
