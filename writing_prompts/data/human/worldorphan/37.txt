I sat in the exact center of shrine surrounding the World Portal, meditating. Waiting. I could hear him climbing the stairs that spiraled up to the top of the mountain. He would be here soon.
  

  
When the warrior finally reached the top, he did not bow, or make any show of respect like he was supposed to. He simply stared at me. Finally he asked, “Who are you? You're not the Sage. You're just a child!”
  

  
I got to my feet, holding my staff at my side. “Even sages don't live forever,” I told him. I was the sage's assistant. When he passed on to the next life, last winter, he gave all of his Words to me. I am the Sage, now.”
  

  
“How old are you? Six?”
  

  
“Nine.”
  

  
“Well, kid, are you going to let me though the portal?”
  

  
“You must challenge me in order to gain entrance to the World Portal.”
  

  
“I'm not fighting a child,” the warrior sneered.
  

  
“They you shall not go through the World Portal.”
  

  
“Have it your way.” He drew his sword and rushed at me.
  

  
The first time his sword struck my gilded staff, its magic showed me his past. I saw the youngest son of a noble, struggling to perform as well as his older brothers, always doing his best to make his father proud.
  

  
The second time his sword struck my staff, I saw his present. His kingdom was under attack from an evil wizard. His eldest brother, now ruler of his lands, directed the armies. His second brother rode at the vanguard of those armies, his sword red with the blood of the monsters the wizard summoned. The man who stood before me desired to go through the portal to a World where he could find a magical weapon, talisman, or spell, something to make him powerful enough to defeat the evil wizard and save his people.
  

  
But the third time his sword struck my staff, I saw his future. Once the wizard was dead and his kingdom free from danger, he would use the artifact to become a renowned general, to conquer more lands and expand his holdings. He would fight human armies, not just summoned creatures. Then he would challenge his brothers for the right to rule. He might even slay them. His need for power would never be satisfied.
  

  
I slammed my staff against the ground and said one of my Words, activating the protective powers of the shrine. The flagstones hummed with energy and began to glow.
  

  
“What is this?” the warrior demanded. Then his knees buckled as the power of the shrine hit him and began sapping his strength.
  

  
“You are not worthy to pass through the World Portal,” I informed him. “You will leave now. Go in peace, and meditate upon the darkness in your soul.”
  

  
The warrior tried to raise his sword against me, but it fell from his numb fingers. I said nothing. With a snarl of impotent rage, he turned and stomped back down the mountain stairs.
  

  
Days passed. I waited. I tended the shrine. I swept the flagstones and pruned the cherry trees and trimmed the bonsai. At night, I descended the stairs to my hut, where I slept. I fed my chickens and tended my small garden and broke my fast with a simple meal of eggs and vegetables. Then I ascended the stairs to wait at the shrine once more.
  

  
In time, I again heard footsteps on the stairs. The warrior who arrived at the peak looked much like the last. But this one bowed to me.
  

  
“I have come to challenge the Sage for entry into the World Portal,” he said.
  

  
“I am the Sage. I accept your challenge.”
  

  
He came at me with his swords. Upon his first blow, I saw a child raised in poverty, but loved. He quarreled and fought with his peers and his parents and the authorities of his village. But he was quick to come to the aid of others, should they need it.
  

  
At his first blow, I saw a kingdom beset by a curse, its people suffering and dying. I saw him vow to find some magic in the Worlds beyond his own that would save them.
  

  
With his third blow, I saw him holding his magical talisman, overlooking a kingdom returned to prosperity. I saw him hide it away in a secret place, so that its magic would not be squandered, but saved until it was needed again. Then I saw him return home with the gold the king gave him as a reward, and use it to give his family and the rest of his village a better life.
  

  
I struck my staff upon the ground and took a step back from my opponent. He recognized the signal that the fight was over, bowed, and sheathed his sword.
  

  
“You have been found worthy. You may pass through the World Portal.” I said one of my Words, and the portal filled with light.
  

  
The warrior bowed again, then stepped past me, disappearing into the Worlds Beyond. I hoped I would see him again.
  

  
Days passed. I went about my duties. I waited.
  

  
A lighter set of footsteps ascended the stairs. A girl, not quite grown to womanhood, arrived at the top and bowed to me. She smiled at me, and I smiled back.
  

  
“I want to go through the World Portal,” she said.
  

  
“You must challenge me first,” I replied.
  

  
“I'm not a fighter.”
  

  
“Then touch the staff.”
  

  
At her touch, the staff showed me the daughter of a shopkeeper, staring jealously after her brothers as they left home every day to go to school. I saw her sneaking out of bed at night to read her brothers' schoolbooks by moonlight. In her kingdom, women were not permitted an education. They had few rights and were given away in marriage by their families with litter consideration for their own desires.
  

  
The staff then showed me her longing for knowledge, and her desire to use that knowledge for something important. She wanted to be a healer, or an inventor, or an alchemist, perhaps. She wanted accomplish something great. I saw her future. It was blurred, as it always was, but I knew she would get her fondest wish. And I knew she would use her knowledge to help others.
  

  
“You are worthy,” I told her. “You may pass.” I began to speak a Word.
  

  
“Wait,” she interrupted me. “I'd heard from others that you were a child, and I've been thinking about it. Don't you get terribly lonely?”
  

  
I didn't answer. I didn't need to. She knew.
  

  
The girl went thought the World Portal, and I thought I would never see her again. But a month later, the World Portal opened from the other side, and she came through, carrying something in a covered basket.
  

  
“I'm only here for a minute,” she said. “I hope that's all right, and you'll let me go right back. I found the most wonderful library!” The basket moved on its own, and a strange sound came from it. She removed the cover and pulled out an animal. It looked like a large lemur, with a long, fluffy tail, and very intelligent eyes. As I stared at it, its fur slowly changed from gray to maroon to gold. “I brought you a friend,” she said.
  

  
I took it from her. It's fur was as soft as a cloud. “A friend,” I repeated, a smile spreading unbidden across my face. “Thank you. I needed one of those.”
