Magic, like all things, is a delicate balance of risks and rewards.
  

  
I leaned over the rail of the xebec as it glided across the dark sea. "Tell me again why we're doing this?" I asked the strange woman who'd appeared in the portal circle of the wizards' college and offered me an even stranger proposition.
  

  
Imelda ran her fingers through her long fiery hair and shot me an impish grin. "You're doing this, Magus Kazem, because I'm paying you handsomely in magical reagents that are almost impossible to acquire in your world, or any of the worlds your portals connect to."
  

  
"Right," I said. "Shameless greed and the desire to one-up my colleagues. But why are *you* doing this?"
  

  
“I've had some disagreements with the establishment . . . in a couple of worlds . . . I was detained for a while . . .”
  

  
“So you're a criminal, and you got arrested,” I said.
  

  
She shrugged. “I'm on probation. I'm not allowed to travel to other worlds. They've put a magic tracker on me. Luckily, corruption is alive and thriving. There's a sorcerer on the Worlds Governance Council who will dispel the tracker if I bind a minor eldritch being and deliver it to him.”
  

  
“Oh,” I said. “Well at least you're not going to use it for evil.”
  

  
Finally we arrived at the island. It was just a lump of rock in the middle of the ocean, but it sat on a massive convergence of ley lines. The crew of the xebec wisely moored it a few hundred yards away, and we came ashore in a rowboat.
  

  
While I prepared the binding vessel, a stone jar inlaid with silver sigils, Imelda drew the containment circle, carefully following the instructions she'd copied from my spellbook step by step. 
  

  
“Ready,” Imelda said.
  

  
Imelda and I cut our palms and shed several drops of blood onto the summoning runes I'd drawn around the vessel. Then we retreated to safety outside the containment circle and began to chant. The ley lines glowed as the spell drew upon their magic.
  

  
Inside the circle, a fissure appeared in the air. Shadow drifted out of it and began to solidify. The shape it formed was hard to look at, tentacles and eyes shifting in an impossible configuration. The thing howled, then threw itself at Imelda's circle. A dome of silver energy flared up, preventing its escape. At least, that's how it should have worked. Instead, the dome flashed red, then shattered like glass. The eldritch being soared up into the clouds.
  

  
“What just happened?” Imelda shouted.
  

  
“You tell me!”
  

  
“But I followed the directions exactly!”
  

  
I studied the circle, trying to assess the pathology that caused its failure. Encircling ring, quartz dust for energy, obsidian dust for reflection, time runes, joining runes . . .
  

  
“Where are the sealing runes?”
  

  
“What? I drew all the runes it said . . .” She looked at the scrap of paper. “Oops. I left out a line when I transcribed this. It goes from step eighteen to twenty with no nineteen.”
  

  
“Oh, great. This is the last time I trust an ex-con to help me summon a monster!”
  

  
“Yeah, well, you should never take advice from a rodeo clown, either!”
  

  
“What?”
  

  
“Forget it!”
  

  
I stared into the sky, and the sky stared back. The eldritch horror hung in the clouds, menace filling its eyes. Was it sticking around to kill us? Or was it unable to leave? I realized my part of the ritual had tethered it to the vessel, at least for now. We could still salvage this.
  

  
“We have to lure it back into the circle!” I cried. “This is your fault, so you be the bait!” Without waiting for her response, I frantically started drawing sealing runes.
  

  
Imelda shouted up at the monster. “Hey, fugly! Did your momma screw an octopus, or did she just eat one and shit you out?” With a rumble, the thing turned its eyes toward her. She pulled out a wand and sent a gout of fire directly at it. It snarled in rage. Then she bent over, pulled down her trousers and *mooned* it.
  

  
“Hey, Mister Wizard! Eyes on the symbols, not on my ass!”
  

  
I snapped my attention back to my work. Two runes to go.
  

  
The eldritch creature howled again, a nimbus of soul-destroying energy surrounding it, and rushed at Imelda. At the last moment, she dove out of the circle. I completed the final rune and slapped the circle with my still-bleeding hand. A silvery barrier sprung up, trapping the horror inside. Imelda and I  resumed our chant, forcing the eldritch thing into the vessel. I rushed in and slammed the cork into place, sealing it inside.
  

  
Magic, like all things, is a delicate balance of risks and rewards.
