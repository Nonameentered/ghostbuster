**The Jinn in the White Desert**

“Breakfast time!” Chavi called, as she stirred a pot of rice and lentils. Her children, Ganika and Bhaven, tumbled out of bed and snatched up their bowls. Early morning light crept into their one-room shack. They ate quickly. Once breakfast was finished, Chavi and Ganika went to work, and Bhaven stayed behind with the other small children and the old women.

The salt harvest happened every year at the end of the rainy season.  They dug wide, shallow pans in the soil and filled them with them with salt water pumped from the marsh before it dried out. Chavi scraped the slowly evaporating pool with her rake, breaking up the salt crust so it would form crystals of marketable size.

Clunk.

Her rake struck something hard, probably a stone. Chavi waded into the pool to remove it. But what she extracted from beneath the salt wasn't a stone. It was a box, a beautiful box made from tortoise shell. She could sell this for a lot of money. She tucked it into her skirt before anyone else saw.

Chavi excused herself, went behind a storage building, and pulled out the box to get a better look. It wasn't very big, but it felt oddly heavy, and she thought something might be inside it. She flipped the catch, but the lid had been sealed with wax. She forced it open with her pen knife.

A cloud of smoke erupted from the box. It swirled and condensed into a towering creature with a muscular upper body and a head like a snake. It was, unmistakably, impossibly, a Jinn, just like in the stories Chavi's father had told when she was a little girl.

The Jinn gave a booming laugh. “I see you cowering in fear and wonder, and rightly so! Why is that? Because I am a being of immense power. I've been trapped in that box for a thousand years, and now I'm finally free!”

“So,” Chavi asked, “Are you going to reward me for freeing you? Do I get three wishes?”

“Wishes? An ungrateful sorcerer locked me in that box. In a millennium, no one cared to let me out.  Selfish human, you'll wish for a quick death before I'm done with you!” Then he vanished.

The next morning, Chavi woke to a terrible sound. Rain. It would dissolve the salt, negating much of their hard work. Two days after that, several barrels of the expensive diesel fuel for their pumps caught fire. Chavi thought of the box. Surely all this misfortune was the work of the Jinn.

The day after that, as the sun was setting and Chavi was finishing the last of her work, Ganika came running up to her. “Mama! Bhaven's gone!”

“What?”

“All the little ones are gone! The old ladies fell asleep! They  don't know what happened to them!”

Chavi and the other parents searched the area, and found footprints leading off into the desert. The children might be miles away by now.

Chavi called to her neighbor, “I'm borrowing your truck!” Without waiting for help or permission, she drove off after the children.

The desolate expanse of white salt sand glowed with reflected moonlight. People weren't meant to be here. She needed to find the children before they collapsed from thirst and exposure.

At last she saw them, walking silently as though under a spell. Leading them was the Jinn.

“Let them go! They've done nothing to you!”

“Never!” the Jinn retorted. “Why won't I let them go? Because humans never change! They'll grow up to be just like all the others. Selfish, entitled, greedy. I shall spend the next thousand years punishing humanity!”

Chavi remembered how, in her father's stories, people had tricked malevolent Jinn.

“I don't see how you got trapped in that box in the first place. How did you even fit inside it? Maybe you're lying, and you weren't in the box at all!”

“How dare you call me a liar! I'll prove it!” He dissolved into smoke, which flowed into the box. As soon as all the smoke was inside, Chavi slammed the box shut and flipped the catch, then wrapped the box tightly in a scarf.

From inside it the Jinn wailed. “Let me out! If you release me, I'll reward you handsomely!”

“I don't trust you.”

“You have my promise! I'll even grant you three wishes!”

“I'm good, thanks. I know how you feel about humans. Any wishes you grant would probably turn out badly.”

Once the little ones were all safely home in their beds, she drove back into the desert and buried the Jinn's box under the salt and sand. Hopefully it would be another thousand years before he harmed anyone else.
