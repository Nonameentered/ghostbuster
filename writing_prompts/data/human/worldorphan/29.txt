The Wheeler Ranch wasn't a grand affair, the folks in town had told Silas Hardy when he'd inquired, but Widow Wheeler was fair and honest and likely to be hiring. Silas scanned the buildings and spotted her near the barn. He nudged his horse and trotted up to her.
  

  
“Howdy!” he called out. “I'm looking for work.”
  

  
She rose from where she'd been cleaning out the chicken coop. She was young and quite fetching, with long tousled brown hair and sun-roughened skin, not at all what he'd imagined at hearing the word 'widow'. She stuck out her hand.
  

  
“Miranda.”
  

  
He shook it. “Silas.
  

  
“Well, I've got plenty for you to do. Don't know how well I can pay you, though. Times have been hard since my husband passed on. There's some folks that think . . .”
  

  
She frowned as what had been a dusty blur in the distance resolved itself into half a dozen men on horseback. They galloped up to the barn, surrounding Miranda and Silas.
  

  
“Good afternoon Ms. Wheeler.”
  

  
“Afternoon, Clifton. Bill. Gentlemen. State your business.”
  

  
“Come to see whether you'd considered our offer.”
  

  
“I told you, I'm not selling you my land, or my herd. The price you're offering is way too low. And I wouldn't sell to you lot anyway.”
  

  
“Come on, now, Miranda. Runnin' a ranch is men's work.”
  

  
“Tell me, if I sell everything to you, how am I going to make a living?”
  

  
“You could go work in the saloon. Pretty thing like you, I'm sure the men would pay extra for your company.”
  

  
“Get the hell off my land.”
  

  
With a chorus of mocking laughter, the men rode away.
  

  
“They wanna buy your ranch?” Silas asked.
  

  
“Clifton and Bill Becker are greedy bastards. My Charley never did get on with them. They're known to get drunk and tear up the town, have their way with the saloon girls. They steal cattle, too. Burn their brands over the original owner's brands. They're getting this ranch over my dead body.”
  

  
“Mind if I ask what happened to your husband?”
  

  
“Thrown from a horse. Wasn't anybody's fault but God's.”
  

  
“So you're gonna keep running the ranch yourself?”
  

  
“We moved out West to make a new start after the war. The untamed wilderness held endless possibility, you know? This place was Charley's dream. He'd want me to keep it going.”
  

  
“And what do you want for yourself?”
  

  
She answered him only with silence.
  

  
Silas helped Miranda with the chickens, mended a fence, and did a few other chores. She offered him a bed in the bunk house, but he didn't feel right sleeping there with the long-term hands. He opted to sleep in the barn instead.
  

  
Silas woke to raucous laughter, and the smell of smoke.
  

  
“That bitch!” he heard one of the Becker brothers say. “This'll teach her to tell us no.”
  

  
Silas smelled firewater, too. They were pouring it on the hay to spread the blaze faster. In minutes, the barn would be an inferno. He rolled out of the loft, pistol in hand. The Beckers jumped as he burst in on them, and drew their own irons.
  

  
“You some kinda gunslinger now, drifter?” Clifton chuckled. Beside him, Bill grinned nervously. “You don't owe her nothin'. Why don't you git on outa here?”
  

  
“The West has got a million rattlesnakes like you,” Silas told him, cocking his gun. “There's not many like her. You're gonna leave her alone now.”
  

  
“Yeah? Who's gonna make me?”
  

  
A shot rang out. Clifton was knocked back into the hay. He stared up in confusion, clutching his bleeding shoulder.
  

  
“I am,” said Miranda. Smoke drifted lazily from the rifle in her hands.
  

  
Nearby, a bell started ringing. The ranch hands were rousing, rallying to fight the fire.
  

  
Miranda thumbed another bullet into the rifle. “Get off my land. I ain't gonna tell you again.”
  

  
Bill hefted his brother under the arm, and shoved him up onto his horse. They galloped away into the night.
  

  
After the fire was out, Miranda and Silas stood side by side. She looked back at the barn, then up at the star-filled sky.
  

  
“It's like there's a big ol' hole in the ground that all my dreams are pouring into,” she told him. “Charley wanted to settle down, build a life out here. But me, I wanted to see the other side of the Rocky Mountains. Go all the way to California and see the ocean.”
  

  
“Why don't you?”
  

  
“What about the ranch?”
  

  
“Surely you've got somebody you trust to run it for you?”
  

  
She considered this. “Fred Dalton. I was going to make him trail boss for the next roundup anyway. The men respect him, and the townsfolk like him, too.” She grinned, and Silas could see the plans forming behind her eyes. “I'll ride with the next cattle drive to Abilene. From there I can take a train to Denver. Cross the mountains. Head west.”
  
"I'd love to go with you."
  

  
She looked back up at the sky, starlight reflected in her eyes.
