**Cinderella's Eggs**

“Charlotte! Gabrielle!” my stepmother called from the front parlor. “Are you almost ready? Our guests will be here any minute!”

“Hurry up, Ella!” Charlotte snapped. “You're making us late!”

I threaded the last of the laces on her bodice, tugging a little too hard and making her yelp.  I wanted to tell her she could just lace up her own dress next time. But I didn't. If I talked back to my stepsisters, they'd tell my stepmother, and then I'd be in for it.

Charlotte primped in front of the mirror while I helped Gabrielle with her dress, then they both scuttled downstairs. I trailed after them in no particular hurry. It wasn't like *I* was invited to this afternoon's gathering. I tried to tell myself I wasn't bitter about it. My stepmother saw me and shooed me into the kitchen to help the cook. The doorbell rang, and I lingered out of sight in the hallway to eavesdrop.

“Monsieur Perrault, it's so lovely to see you. Please do make yourself at home.” My stepmother's warm  greeting was edged with a slight simper. Monsieur Perrault was wealthy and very influential. No doubt she was trying to flatter him so that he would give her money. Perhaps she was even considering him as a potential third husband. I wondered if my father would roll over in his grave if he knew. Maybe he wouldn't be that surprised.

“Yes, well, thank you for the invitation.” M. Perrault's voice was deep and silky, and he spoke with a refined Parisian accent that would put the people of our sleepy country town to shame. “May I introduce my son, Charles.” Charlotte and Gabrielle giggled, and I peeked out a little further. Charles was a handsome young man, close in age to myself and my stepsisters. Marrying age.

I retreated to the kitchen before my stepmother caught me spying. “Ah, there you are, Mademoiselle Ella,” the cook exclaimed as she pulled ingredients from shelves. “Madame has requested Salade Lyonnaise for lunch, and she wants it by noon. Let me see. We have lettuce, dandelion greens, bacon, bread, vinegar, mustard . . . Oh dear. We have no eggs!”

“I haven't been to the hen house yet today. I'll go at once.” I snatched up a basket and scurried out the back door. In the dim light of the hen house, I searched each nest, and then picked carefully through the straw on the floor. I didn't find a single egg. Looking around, I didn't see any chickens, either. I examined the wire fencing around the coop, and discovered a hole just large enough for a hen to slip through. Not again!

“Here chick-chick-chick!” I called. I hefted a sack of grain down from the rafters and poured it into their feed dish, kernels clinking loudly against the metal pan. Five fat brown hens trotted into the pen and began eagerly pecking at their meal. Where was the sixth one? And where were all the eggs? Our hens might be the best escape artists in France, but they were reliable layers.

I began searching the yard. I found a speckled egg in the tall grass beside the stoop. It was a fine start, but I needed five. Dry leaves crunched under my feet as I checked under the hedges. Three more eggs. I hoped none of the hens had wandered into the woods beyond the yard. Our neighbors sometimes poached small game on our property, and I'd found traps out there before.

“Bonjour!” a voice called cheerfully from behind me. Charles grinned as he strode across the lawn.

“Monsieur! What are you doing out here?”

“My father and Madame were talking about finance, and the young ladies – well, I got bored. They wanted to join me out here, but they had to change their shoes so they wouldn't be ruined.” He laughed. “Imagine, living in the country and owning shoes that can't be worn outdoors. What are their shoes made of? Glass?” I couldn't help but be charmed by his casual nature.

“You haven't seen a chicken around here, have you? Or any eggs?”

“In fact, I did. Under the lavender bush by the front door.”

I hurried around the house and found the last hen scratching in the dirt by the walk. And under the lavender bush was an egg. I popped it in my basket. “You're a life saver,” I told Charles.

“So, are you a servant here?”

I felt myself flush. “I've got to get back to the kitchen. If lunch isn't ready when the clock strikes twelve, Madame will stuff me in a pumpkin or something.” I dashed off to deliver the eggs to the cook. But I glanced over my shoulder and thought I saw him watching me go.
