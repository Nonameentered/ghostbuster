**Fairies in Gold** 
  

  
The church was rather plain on the outside, it's walls carved from rosy granite, with only modest ornamentation around the lintels. But when Father Bertram pushed open the heavy oak doors, Lucas staggered at the sight. Pillars of pale marble soared upwards, supporting arched ceilings decorated with murals of angels and saints ascending into glowing clouds. Gilded carvings of vines and flowers, animals and cherubs flowed down the pastel-accented walls like glittering waterfalls. The excess of it all made him dizzy.
  

  
“You're lucky, you know,” the priest told the boy. “When a family sends a son into the service of the Church, the Bishop can assign him anywhere. A pilgrimage church like this one is a fine appointment.”
  

  
Lucas nodded dumbly. He tried to listen as Father Bertram listed off his new duties as an acolyte, but everywhere he looked, something new and exciting caught his eye. The priest scolded him repeatedly for his inattention. Eventually, he gave up on instruction and put the boy to work. Lucas swept and dusted and scrubbed and straightened. His new chores, it seemed, were never-ending.
  

  
That night, Lucas couldn't sleep. He'd never been away from home before his hard bed in his tiny cell was nothing like what he was used to. He got up and cracked open his door. Light from the sanctuary drifted down the hallway. He crept towards it.
  

  
In the light of dozens of candles surrounding the altar, Father Bertram knelt in solemn prayer. Lucas marveled at his perfect stillness, and the piety and intense focus on the Lord that it surely demonstrated. Then a faint snoring rose from the old priest's throat.
  

  
Moving as silently as he could, Lucas slunk between the pews until he was just a few rows behind Father Bertram. Now, with no one to rush him on to his next task, he had time to study the wondrous decorations, taking in every miraculous detail. During the day, sunlight from the high windows made the room bright and airy, as if the ceiling and walls were made of clouds with golden edges. But in the dark of night, lit only by flickering candlelight from below, the gilded figures seemed to writhe like living things.
  
Then, one of the figures *did* move. It was no trick of the light. A leaf lifted off the wall and flattened again, an inch ahead of its original position. Three more leaves near it did the same, dragging a cluster of leaves and vines forward. It scuttled along the wall like a lizard, all the way to the ceiling, crawling onto a mural and breaking the forced-perspective illusion of the sky. On the opposite wall, a pair of large flower petals flapped lazily, like the wings of a butterfly. But when it rose gracefully from the wall, the curls that pulled away with it formed a tiny human figure.
  

  
The sacred became secular as the wings of a cherub fluttered to life. As it extracted itself from the ornamental trumpets and harps surrounding it, it stretched its body, becoming another fairy, one with feathered wings. The two fairies cavorted around the sanctuary as yet more creatures crawled free of the decorations and frisked along the walls. Lucas clapped his hand over his mouth to suppress his delighted laughter. He glanced at Father Bertram, but the old priest remained oblivious and still.
  

  
The fairies chased each other around the columns and over the balconies. As they swooped down over the altar, one of them upset a candle. It toppled over, spilling wax onto an embroidered altar-cloth, which burst into flames, flooding the space with warm light. The fire spread across the altar, until it reached a bowl of sacramental oil. There was a bright explosion, before a return to darkness as Lucas pulled off his cassock and used it to smother the flames. In his haste, the bumped into Father Bertram, who came awake with a snort.
  

  
“What in the name of – ” He looked at the scattered candles and charred altar-cloth. “What have you done, boy?”
  

  
Lucas's eyes darted around the room, but all of the golden creatures had returned to their places among the decorations. “I – I couldn't sleep, and came to – to pray. A draft blew over one of the candles, but you were so deep in prayer that you didn't see. And – ”
  

  
“And you extinguished the fire and saved the church. Not bad for your first night.” The old priest smiled. “Now back to bed with you, boy.”
  

  
“Yes, sir.” Lucas scurried down the hall to his cell, shut the door, and flopped down on the bed. He thought he'd be too excited to sleep, but as his eyes closed he was carried away into dreams of glittering golden fairies.
