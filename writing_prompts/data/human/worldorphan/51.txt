The portal opened into a moonlit jumble of concrete and metal. It was eerily silent as the two worldwalkers stepped through.
  

  
“Where are we?” Imelda asked.
  

  
“Not sure,” Ishumi replied. “The Rivers Between the Worlds are always shifting. That portal led somewhere else the last time I went through it.”
  

  
Ishumi twisted her hands in complicated gestures, until her fingertips glowed. She extended one hand and spun in a slow circle. “I can feel the pull of another portal not far from here. This way.”
  

  
Imelda would have preferred to spend another moment taking in her surroundings. Buildings rose, some intact and bizarre in design, with clockwork and crystals and weirdly angled walls. Others were collapsed and crumbling. Ishumi jerked on the chain attached to Imelda's manacles, and dragged her along.
  

  
Ishumi moved with catlike grace, her dark skin and black leather outfit making her just one more shadow. Imelda stumbled over the broken ground, awkward without the use of her hands. She had to stop occasionally to free the skirt of her frock-coat from a corner of broken masonry or untangle her long red hair from a piece of rebar.
  

  
“You could take these cuffs off, you know,” Imelda told her captor. “I won't run.”
  

  
“You're wanted for theft, vandalism, and crimes of general mayhem in a dozen worlds,” Ishumi scoffed. “So forgive me if I don't believe you.”
  

  
“You really think I'm that dastardly? After all the adventures we've had together? We're practically buddies!”
  

  
“By adventures, you mean me trying to arrest you, and you getting away?”
  

  
“Fun times, right? I feel like we really bonded.”
  

  
“Quiet.”
  

  
“Come on, Ishumi . . .”
  

  
“No, listen.”
  

  
All around them, they heard a metallic clattering sound. As it got closer, it was accompanied by the whirring of gears and the hiss and clank of pistons.
  

  
“AAIIYEEE!”
  

  
From behind a half-broken wall pounced a giant mechanical spider. It's rider was short, green, and ugly, with pointed ears and too many teeth. It screeched again, and twenty of its brethren skittered out of the side streets on their own robotic bug mounts.
  

  
“Goblins?” cried Imelda. “You brought us to a goblin world?” The nastiness and voraciousness of goblins transcended all the worlds. And humans were definitely on their menu.
  

  
“Look, I never expected to end up here. We didn't have a lot of choices,” Ishumi argued. She drew a pair of curved blades and parried the spear the goblin thrust at her. “You were the one who got us stuck in the Gray City in the first place.”
  

  
“That wasn't my fault!” Imelda protested. Another goblin skittered up behind them. She ducked its sword and drove her boot through its bug-bot's face. Electricity arced out of it, then smoke. She rolled away as it exploded. 
  

  
The blast sent Ishumi staggering. She cursed, but regained her footing in time to slice through another spear. She followed up with a slash across the goblin's face. It toppled from its spider and crawled away, hissing.
  

  
Ishumi yelled, “There are too many! Run!”
  

  
They raced through the twisted streets, goblins in close pursuit. The city had been razed at some point, and Imelda wondered whether the upheaval leading to its destruction had been political or geological. The goblins had built new structures on top of the ruins of the old ones without bothering to clear away the debris.
  

  
Ishumi's guidance spell led them at last to a courtyard of kexy dead grass, and then into a massive building. It felt like a concrete cathedral. Its vaulted ceiling disappeared into the shadows. Ishumi sealed the doors with more magic.
  

  
"The portal is nearby," Ishumi said. The far end of the room held stone benches and an altar, and beyond these, a door. But before they could reach it, the windows exploded inward, and a horde of goblins leaped through. 
  

  
The goblins rushed them in a manic wave of teeth, claws, and blades. Ishumi parried and sliced, but even she couldn't keep up with that many opponents. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a goblin flying at her with a knife. Then Imelda skewered it with her rapier. Her manacles dangled from one wrist.
  

  
“Could you get out of those this entire time?”
  

  
Imelda smirked.
  

  
Back to back, they fought off the goblins, until the floor was littered with bodies. Some were dead, but most were twitching or crawling away. Goblins didn't die easily. Outside, the mechanical bugs scrabbled at the walls, trying to squeeze in through the narrow windows. They would get in eventually.
  

  
The two worldwalkers dashed through the door beyond the altar. The room beyond it held a magic circle etched into the floor. The portal.
  

  
“Where do you think it leads?” Imelda asked Ishumi.
  

  
“Hopefully somewhere without goblins.”
