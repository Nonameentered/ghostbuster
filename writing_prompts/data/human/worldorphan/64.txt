**The King, the Princess, and the Bison**

Once upon a time in Poland, there lived a king. His prowess in battle was great, and his holdings grew larger every year. One of the lands he conquered contained an immense forest, abounding with life. He sent men to cut down trees and build a mighty hunting lodge, painted all in white. It dwelled on the border of field and forest, and he visited it often. 
  

  
One day, the king, whose name was Jagiello, went hunting in the forest. Presently, he saw an old woman sitting on a log. She was a hideous old crone, so he pretended not to see her.
  

  
Later, the king stopped for a midday meal. As he was eating, the old woman from before sat down bedside him.
  

  
"Good day to you, fine sir. Might you spare some food for an old woman?"
  

  
King Jagiello looked down his nose at her. "Certainly not! It would be unfitting for a king to sup in such low company. Be gone with you!"
  

  
By mid afternoon, King Jagiello had killed two bucks, a hare, and a fox. He was considering returning to his lodge, when he spied a bison. He drew his bow and felled the proud beast with one shot. But when he went to his kill, he found the same old woman sitting beside it.
  

  
"My husband will be displeased,” she said. “He is a leshy, a powerful guardian spirit of this forest. All of its plants and creatures are in his custody, and the bison are his most prized possessions. He is as big as a tree, and could easily tear you in half. Had you shown me kindness, I might have convinced him to spare you. Still, you are king of these lands, and I don't wish him to kill you."
  

  
All around them, the primeval forest whispered. The leshy's wife said, "the forest has watched as you cut down its trees. The forest has watched as you ignored those in need. The forest has watched as you killed its creatures. And the forest shall give you what you deserve."
  

  
With a swirl of leaves, she transformed him into a bison. Then she vanished. King Jagiello tried to return home, but seeing through bison eyes, he no longer recognized the way.
  

  
For a year, Jagiello the bison lived in the forest. He drank from streams and grazed in sunlit clearings. He fled from wolves, and the bows of invasive hunters. His hide grew tough and scarred. In the winter he found a herd of other bison and huddled with them for warmth. In the spring he witnessed the birth of their calves. He came to admire the towering trees. There was a stillness about them, a kind of reverence.
  

  
One day, King Jagiello's daughter, Kaja, set out in search of her father. With a royal huntsman escorting her, she rode into the forest. Presently, the princess saw an old woman. Unbeknownst to her, it was the leshy's wife, who had transformed Jagiello. Kaja called out a cheerful greeting.
  

  
"Good day, young miss," the woman replied. "Might you do a favor for an old woman?" She held out a handful of acorns. "I wish to plant these, but my hands are too frail."
  

  
Kaja took the acorns, and planted them in the soil. The woman thanked her, and disappeared.
  

  
When Kaja stopped for her midday meal, the old woman sat down beside her. “Might you spare some food for an old woman?” she asked. Kaja happily gave her half of what she had. The old woman ate it, thanked her, and slipped away between the trees.
  

  
Late in the afternoon, as Kaja was considering heading back to the lodge, the huntsman stopped her. In the clearing ahead stood a magnificent bison. The huntsman drew his bow. Some sound must have revealed them, for the bison turned its head. In its gaze, Kaja saw nobility. Surely this bison was the leader of a herd, and would be sorely missed. Kaja stayed the huntsman's hand.
  

  
“Well done, gently lady,” a voice said. It was the leshy's wife again. “The forest has watched you as you helped it grow. The forest has watched you as you showed kindness to others. The forest has watched you as you spared its creatures. And now, the forest shall give you what you desire.” With a swirl of leaves, the bison was transformed back into King Jagiello. 
  

  
The old woman turned to the king. “Because of the goodness of your daughter, and because you have grown wise from your time under my spell, all has been forgiven.”
  

  
King Jagiello thanked her, and swore that from that day forward, the kings of Poland would protect the forest. And he and his descendants kept this promise to the end of their days.
