**The Statue Thief**
  

  
“This is the third one to go missing in the past two weeks,” Tracy from the City Parks Commission told us, gesturing toward the empty bench. Yesterday, a metal statue of a little girl had occupied its center. 
  

  
I examined it, puzzled. The bench seat was perfectly smooth, showing no marks from where the statue had been cut free. How had that been accomplished? “And you said there weren't any leads?”  
  

  
Tracy shook her head. “We don't have security cameras in this part of the park, Detective Russell. It must have happened at night, or someone would have seen something. Who would steal a statue, anyway?”
  

  
“It's a prank, obviously,” my partner, Todd Mills, said.
  

  
“The statues beautify the park,” Tracy explained. “but also it's to prevent crime.”
  

  
I glanced over to where a woman was struggling to change her toddler's diaper, hampered by armrests that split her bench into thirds. “Is it such a crime to be comfortable on a bench? It stands in opposition to the original intent, don't you think?”
  

  
“Well, it's to dissuade . . . *the homeless*.” Tracy whispered the last part, as if naming society's undesirables out loud might attract them.
  

  
“Maybe the thief is protesting defensive architecture,” I suggested. Of the other two stolen statues, one was of a boy from the middle of another bench, and the other was of a dog sleeping on a wide, low wall. In the whole park, there wasn't a single spot large enough for a person to lie down that wasn't occupied by a statue, or concrete flowers, or some other raised ornamentation.
  

  
“We'll do some surveillance tonight,” I told Tracy, “and see if we can catch the thief in action.”

After sundown, we parked our car on the street beside the park and waited. A trio of teenagers came to mess around on their skateboards, but quickly got bored without any smooth rails or walls to do tricks on. A woman with a shopping cart stopped to eat a sandwich before moving on. We witnessed what might have been a drug deal. Todd wanted to interrupt it, but settled for notifying the Vice Division. 
  

  
We took turns napping. At last, around three in the morning, I nudged Todd awake.
  

  
“Ugh, Nora, it better not be another bag lady.” He squinted into the darkness. “Is that a kid?”
  

  
A small figure came skipping across the playground, followed by two others, and dog. I didn't see any adults nearby. They hopped onto the swings, while the dog ran in circles around them. Cautiously, I climbed out of the car and approached. 
  

  
As we got close, they all stopped and stared at us.
  

  
Todd swore softly in confusion.
  

  
The two smaller children, a boy and a girl, and the dog, were all one color. Their skin, hair, clothing, and even their eyes, were a uniform bronze, and glinted in the sparse light.
  

  
The third child was . . . different. Her frilly yellow dress was tattered. Her hair was a wild mess, and  huge pointed ears stuck out beneath it. Her skin was an odd green-gray. She grinned at me, and her teeth were pointed.
  

  
“Wanna play?” she asked. 
  

  
“Um, sure?” 
  

  
“What are you doing, Nora?” Todd hissed, but I shushed him. This wasn't my first time encountering something . . . unusual.
  

  
She bounced over to a wall decorated with bronze flowers. Somehow, she lifted a few off the wall and wrap them around my wrist like bracelet. They were cold and heavy like metal, but they felt soft, like real flowers. I looked from the flowers to the other two children and the dog, and I understood.
  

  
“What are you?” I asked her. “How are you doing this?”
  

  
The little creature shrugged. “You people have lots of funny names for me. Fairy, elf, goblin. I like to play in this park. But I was lonely. I saw these three, and they looked lonely, too. So I made friends with them.”
  

  
“They're . . . alive?”
  

  
“They say every piece of art has a soul,” she answered. “I didn't think it was fair for them to have to be still all the time.”
  

  
I nodded, slowly. “Okay, well, the city authorities don't like statues disappearing from their park, so don't animate any more of them, please.” I handed her my flowers. “And put these back.”
  

  
She looked sad, but did what I asked.
  

  
“What? That's it?” Todd protested. “We're just going to disregard the laws she's broken?”
  

  
I looked at him. “Seriously? Are you planning to take them to the station for processing?”
  

  
“Um . . .”
  

  
“Some crimes never get solved.” I turned away from the goblin girl and her metal friends, and dragged Todd back to the car. “There's just no way to control everything.”
