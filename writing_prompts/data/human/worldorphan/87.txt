Aratiri crept along the wall that surrounded the mission town, his bow drawn and taut. The hare he had been trailing hopped beneath the gate, denying him a clean shot. Suddenly it bolted as the gate swung open and two men emerged. Aratiri dropped prone, hoping they would pass him by. Then he yelped as one of the men hauled him up by the ear.
  

  
"Stealing from the garden again, boy?" Brother Tomas sneered.
  

  
"No. I was hunting.” As he squirmed, round green fruits spilled from his sack.
  

  
Brother Tomas snatched one up. "Liar! And these tomatoes aren't even ripe!"
  

  
"It's called a wolf apple. It's not a tomato." Aratiri tried to grab it back. Someone cuffed the side of his head.
  

  
"Do not correct your elders and betters," Marangatu admonished. Marangatu had once been a prestigious man in Aratiri's village, but he had given all that way. When the Jesuits came from Spain and built their mission, Marangatu, among others, had gone to live with them and their new god. 
  

  
Marangatu took the fruit. "It's true, though. This isn't from our garden. The village has no wantage of food. They don't need to steal. Aratiri, you mustn't hunt so close to the mission."
  

  
"I was sent to find you, Marangatu. Luison has been seen prowling around the village, but we don't know who he's come for. Mama Jeruti wants you to come home."
  

  
Brother Tomas grimaced. "Luison? The wolf-man?"
  

  
"He's not a wolf, or a man. He's a monster." Marangatu gave Aratiri another smack, but he continued. "Luison haunts graveyards, and comes when someone's about to die. And he punishes the unworthy."
  

  
"Good Christian men needn't fear such myths," Brother Tomas chastised.
  

  
"No matter," Marangatu said. "If Jeruti wants me, I will come. I owe her my respect even if I no longer share her beliefs."
  

  
"Do as you must. And boy, if you do see a wolf, kill it. We've lost three chickens."
  

  
"The maned wolf doesn't eat chickens. A weasel took them." Marangatu tried to box Aratiri's ears, but he ducked.
  

  
It was late afternoon. As they set out through the Cerrado, crepuscular animals were beginning to peek out of their hiding places in anticipation of dusk. The easiest route to the village was following the stream, or the gallery forest that shrouded it. Aratiri kept his bow ready. Maned wolves might not harm chickens or humans, but other predators stalked the grasslands and lurked in the trees. 
  

  
Marangatu grabbed Aratiri's arm. A maned wolf crouched nearby, unawares. Obediently, Aratiri aimed his bow. It seemed unfair. The animal was being blamed for something it hadn't done. Aratiri knew how that felt. He shot, missed on purpose, and the wolf bounded out of sight. Marangatu was angry, but Aratiri said nothing.
  

  
They resumed their trek. Aratiri pointed into the trees, where he had seen a pair of yellow eyes. Marangatu ignored him. Had he not seen? Aratiri remained vigilant. They would be safe as long as they stayed in the open. Ahead of them, however, the stream branched, a wide stretch of forest surrounding the fork. They had no choice but to go through. 
  

  
Marangatu noticed Aratiri's trepidation. "I trust in our Savior to protect us. At least, He will protect me."
  

  
Aratiri felt those yellow eyes still upon him as they moved beneath the canopy. He said a prayer to Tupa, god of his people. A shadow slunk through the trees beside them, closing in.
  

  
Marangatu saw it too. He was also praying. He caught Aratiri's eye. "Where is your god now?"
  

  
"I was going to ask you the same thing."
  

  
The jaguar pounced. Aratiri loosed an arrow at it, striking its shoulder. Marangatu screamed and fled. Aratiri raced after him, the limping jaguar on his heels. 
  

  
They burst out of the trees and tore through the grasses. Suddenly a dark, hulking shape appeared in front of them.
  

  
Marangatu stumbled, fell to his knees. “Luison! No! I haven't forsaken the old ways, not really! Please, have mercy!”
  

  
Aratiri ducked, determined to be a survivor. The jaguar pounced again, and the dark shape launched itself, colliding with it mid-air. It was not Luison. It was an enormous maned wolf. They hit the ground and rolled, biting and snarling. But a maned wolf, even one so large, was no match for a jaguar. Was this creature going to give away it's life to save them? 
  

  
Aratiri drew his bow, waited for his opportunity, and fired. The arrow struck the jaguar through the eye, and it went limp. The maned wolf struggled free. It stared for a moment at Aratiri. Then it disappeared into the growing dark.
  

  
Marangatu hoisted the body of the jaguar over his shoulders. “I told you my God would save us,” he smirked. Aratiri knew better.
