Papa always said that good cookin' was made with *loooove.* He'd say it just like that, too. Like he was swoonin' jus' from thinkin' about it. 

And I always laughed, but that's jus' how he taught me to do. We spent so much of my childhood cookin' together. He taught me jus' about everythin' about food. It was thanks to him I got into cookin' school. What a blast that was for me! My fellow classmates couldn't understand how some *simpleton* from smalltown-nowheresville in Georgia could cook them right under the table.

There was this one gent that always caught my eye, *and* my nose, but he wouldn't dare speak to me due to me bein' so hated an' all. But I watched that man and he was dang good, even I could admit that. I could smell his dishes from my cookin' station across the kitchen and it would jus' make me salivate. And on Jambalaya day, I couldn't help myself. I *had* to taste it. It smelled *divine* like sun shinin' on Sunday Feast and I had no more power over my own feet than anyone else's. I forgot that I was the curse of the classroom and the shock on that man's face just about broke my heart. But I swallowed my pride with a side of brazen nerve and I said, "Sweetheart that smells wonderful, could I try some?"

And like all the corny romance movies say, *that was that.* Instead of gettin' glares of burnin' hatred, I started gettin' glances of existence, which I supposed was jus' fine with me. It made school tolerable again and when we finally made it out, Jason and I planned to open our own restaurant. 

Of course, life likes to remind us that we ain't livin' in one of them corny romance movies. Jason left me for a french baker he met while scoutin' for vendors abroad. It was dreadful timin', too, since the space was already rented and work already started, an' I tell you what, I had somethin' of a *panic*. I made calls to any family I could reach beggin' for someone to help me out, 'least til I was able to get the kitchen up an' runnin'. But no one could help me, an' if I'm bein' honest, I wouldn't have had anyone but Papa in that kitchen with me anyway. 

So, what could I do? I had to beg banks for loans to cover Jason's half of the costs til at least the grand opening. Turned out my family was in pretty good standing and I was at least able to get some loans with their help. Bless 'em. 

Anyway, so I was on my way back to bein' happy doin' what I loved. When the kitchen opened, I christened it with a feast for everyone I had in my contacts list. The professionals had some official name for an event like it, but to me, it was a family reunion. There was nothin' else in my way of honoring Papa and the legacy of his cookin'. The event decorator had the dining room lookin' flawless and stunnin' like a Elizabethan ball. My servers were dressed in tidy whites with purple bow ties for the occasion, though the final uniform was meant to be much more formal - still, it was like a dream come to life. 

Chatter was lively! Dishes were served in courses, each nibbled and picked at til the next course arrived. But chatter died down and I could hear mere murmurs between aunties and cousins and saw wary glances drift my way before I noticed. They looked away like I ain't jus' caught 'em at it. Finally, I had *enough.* I said, "Now what in the heck is goin' on with y'all?" and they had the gall to look around at each other 'steada me. I looked each of 'em in the eye seein' if one of 'em would fess up. When I circled the entire table, makin' sure to stare extra hard at everyone, I decided who I was gonna interrogate.

"Auntie Mary. Papa was your brother, so you know how much this would mean to him. If I done somethin' wrong, you gotta tell me." 

"Oh, baby. You ain't done nothin' wrong. The food is *fine.* But, I guess that's just the problem. It's jus' fine." 

The other bodies in the room went as still as I did while I tried to understand jus' what was goin' on. But, I couldn't. So, I plopped on down in my chair and just stared at my plate. I stared good an' hard an' I thought I could just about break it with my thoughts, but I didn't. Auntie Mary came up behind me and gave my shoulders a comfortin' squeeze. It jus' didn't help things. All it did was make me cry my eyes out like I was the Niagara Falls. But when I was done, I told my story.

My family was *outraged* an' that's to say the least. There was shoutin' an' hootin' an' hollerin' that I couldn't help but join in on. Boy, I was *mad* as heck, I tell ya. Now I done lost my cookin' mojo an' I got a major restaurant openin' in a week's time. It wasn't enough an' I was losin' hope real fast.

I spent the next five days cookin' my specialties over an' over until I ran outta ingredients. Still, could not get it right and my frustration was startin' to get the better of me. My jaw clenched tight and my knuckles turned white on the grip of my pans and spatulas and the madder I got, it turned out, the better the food got. So, I let myself remember Jason's promises and I gave in to the taboo urge to call that man a *scumbag* - *out loud!* and I tell you what, my cookin' never tasted better by that fifth day. By grand opening, I was so enraged an' ready to cook up a storm. 

Of course, I had to leave plating to others so I didn't accidentally smash any dishes. I sure as heck did smash that openin' though. My family came back for that grand openin' and they were so happy for me that we all hugged and cried before they left. Auntie Mary stayed back though. She helped me clean up in the kitchen and we gabbed and joked like we always used to. But she seemed to have somethin' burnin' a hole in her cheek, so I said, "What's on your mind, Auntie Mary?" 

"It's jus'. I don't get how you did it."

"You know how Papa always taught me to cook with *loooove?*" An' I said it jus' like that. Jus' like Papa swoonin' jus' thinkin' about it. "Well 'steada that, I cooked with the feelin' that *love* ended up givin' me. *Hate.*"
