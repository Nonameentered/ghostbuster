Atop the bluff overlooking the beach, broken shutters creaked and clanged with the wind. Set against acres of wild wood, the inn’s layers of paint flaked off the siding in varying shades of whites and blues. Within, there was nothing but the bones of a forgotten haven, or at least that’s how it appeared.

Leonard, the sole resident of the inn, made it his life’s work to look after the place. He dwelled in a shed near the driveway entrance, far enough from the structure to feel safe, but near enough to keep watch. The signs were worn clean by wind and rain, erasing the name but not the story of the old building. No one remembers when it started, but Leonard was determined to ensure the legend would not be lost to the passing of time.

He was never fazed by the stories that were retold year after year at nearby campsites by fires that blazed under sticks dripping with melted marshmallow. Hell, some of the stories were even about him. He was honored to be the hook-handed serial killer of the beach. At least it kept the pesky kids away – most of the time. He tried so hard to protect those lovesick dummies.

The signs he erected surrounding the property were meant to warn even the daftest of the school-aged, yet over and over he witnessed doomed pairs that hadn’t heeded his warnings. He never understood what was so ambiguous about a sign that read “Do not enter, you will die!” Even the chains on the gates weren’t secure enough to keep them out. 

The night before Halloween, Leonard overheard a couple lurking about the shadows outside of his maintenance shed.

A young woman stage-whispered to her paramour, “Are you sure it’s safe here? All the signs-”

“They were put up by that crazy-ass innkeeper. I’m sure it’s fine. Let’s go, you can hop on my shoulders.”

*Alone in death,* Leonard thought. He supposed he better get up to try to scare off the morons. After whipping off his blanket, he leaned on his cane and shuffled to the coatrack to put on a hat to keep away the chill, not even bothering to change from his pajamas.

The couple looking for a place to neck in private was arranged like a totem pole, with the young woman on the shoulders of the young man in a blue and white letterman jacket. Her skirt was removed to place over the barbed wire Leonard meticulously wove to keep people out. 

No one could say he didn’t try. The kids all just shrugged off his warnings, thinking *who cares if it’s true or not* and just wandering their naive butts straight into their own violent ends, despite even the highly publicized deaths of their own neighbors. Such a waste.

“Hey! You kids!” He shouted as loudly as he could since they were so far still, and he shook his cane over his head at them, then continued to hobble in their direction to warn them. “And put your clothes back on!”

The young man jumped and lost his hold on his girlfriend and fell back into the dirt, leaving her dangling from the fence, propped over thinly covered barbed wire. That was going to leave a mark. 

“Jimmy!!!” the young woman screamed and flailed. She was darting glances between Leonard and her boyfriend as if the old guy was going to rush her and do harm.

“Young lady, get down from there. Just let go, you are going to hurt yourself!” 

She screamed some more, drowning out the rest of what Leonard had to say, which was such a shame. 

Jimmy got his feet back under him, scooped his girlfriend back up and then over the fence, and quickly followed behind. They both ran screaming from Leonard… 

Right into the dilapidated inn. 

The sign holder snapped off the awning and blocked the door where they entered. Leonard sighed and waddled his way back to the shed.

The ringing phone masked the curses Leonard muttered under his breath as he called 9-1-1 for the umpteenth time.

The man on the other end of the line grumbled about how it wasn’t Halloween or a full moon yet, and they’d almost made it a year since the last deaths. Nevertheless, the man assured Leonard they’d be on their way immediately. The poor man was forced to listen to the gurgling and squelching screams while he waited for their arrival. 

To this day no one knows what lives in the inn, but Leonard knows no one ever will again.
