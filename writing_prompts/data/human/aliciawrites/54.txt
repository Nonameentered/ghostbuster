Hey Kat and geese! 

I've been working on two long-term projects recently. One, I've already started "publishing" as a serial over on /r/shortstories and the other is just question marks. 

I know that I will probably want to self-publish my serial if I ever finish it and polish it up, but the other one is just question marks.

So, that leads to my questions: How do I know what to aim for with a longform project as far as word counts or content? Should I be thinking this early about publication? If so, how do I go about finding information?
