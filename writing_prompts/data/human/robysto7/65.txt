*Man this sucks! Look how much fun everybody else is having. Four spidermen pointing at each other and laughing. Batman is slapping Robin yelling about his dead parents. Grumpy cat is running away from long cat while ceiling cat just watches from above.*

*They had to have karaoke didn't they? A Tay Zonday and Rebecca Black duet of "Never Gonna Give You Up" brings tears to my eyes. I can't stop crying. Not even Nyancat zipping around the party cheers me up.*

*Scumbag Steve is laughing at the Star Wars kid, he's a jackass. At least Techno Viking looks like he's having fun, he's digging the vibe. I tried talking to the blonde woman but she was too busy yelling at the cat across the table. The girl in pigtails kept rambling about gersberms. My eyes hurt from crying so much.*

*I need some fresh air. The only place to sit outside was next to Keanu, he looked sad too. I didn't say anything to him. He let me have a bite of his sandwich, it wasn't good. This was the wrong year to attend the reddit old meme costume party. Feels bad man.*
