"Alright maggots listen up! Don't have time to pussyfoot around on this one so I'm only going to go over the operation once! Clean the shit out of your ears and pay attention! Smoke em if you got em." Captain Zaras addressed the eight members of Z-team that assembled in the field command center. Every member already geared up and kitted out with enough firepower to level a small city. Zaras chomped on the end of his cigar while tracing his laser pointer across a large map of the operational zone.

"Four teams of two. North, south, east, west. All the cardinal directions. Fast rappel from the choppers to street level, clear it out block by block. Push towards main street. Eliminate anything that moves, no exceptions. We got a big mess to clean up tonight ladies and gentlemen. Tag any salvageable equipment or gear you stumble across while clearing. Do not pick it up.

Comms with HQ are gonna be spotty at best, infrastructure has already crumbled in the city, if omega team's mobile command unit is toast we're gonna have to hunt in the dark, good thing we're the best at that. Too bad those things are as well.

Do not. I repeat. Do not remove your mask for any reason, if you or your partner's mask sustains any damage or becomes compromised in any way, put em down. That's an order. This operation comes from the tippy top. No screw ups, we're the last line of defense ladies and gentlemen. We trained for this, I believe we will succeed. Any questions?"

First Lieutenant Graham raised her hand. "No jabs for this mission?" she asked.

Zaras shook his head. "No antidote for this one, they gave up trying after Q-squad failed. Let's not have the same fate befall us. Dismissed. Call your loved ones and pray to whatever deity you believe in. Roll out in thirty minutes."
