***New Traditions***

Huddled masses packed the streets of Star City tooting their party horns and popping their party poppers waiting for the crystal ball to drop and wipe the slate clean for another year. High above their heads floated Dr. Neutron's war zeppelin. The people small as ants when looked down upon. Dr. Neutron sat alone in the small banquet hall on the zeppelin's third floor, decorated to resemble the speakeasies of old. He sipped champagne by candlelight, he adjusted his tuxedo, wanted to look good.

Echoing footsteps crept in the dimly lit banquet hall, sounded like heels. A soft orange glow broke through the shadows. "Ah, so you did receive my invitation. I was starting to worry." Dr. Neutron looked the super up and down. She was radiant. Pale orange hair fell around her shoulders, she curled it tonight. Her delicate face contrasted against the green nuclear fire that burned behind orange irises. The doctor was right, she was wearing heels, tall black strapless ones, tight leather pants with an equally tight white halter top completed her outfit. Dr. N felt overdressed.

"You seem pretty calm for someone who's threatening to release a mind control gas at midnight. Where you hiding it? I already peaked around, didn't find a thing." Fuzion's lilting voice made it difficult to convey the menace she wanted.

"My reach exceeded my grasp on that one. I couldn't get access to the big ball, that's how I wanted to disperse it. Without that there's no showmanship to it, no pizzazz. No point. My apologies if I wasted your time. Looks like you're on the way to a party. Don't let me stop you. Nice to see you."

Fuzion strolled over and sat across from the doctor. She sighed. "Was gonna head over to my sister's place but she had to cancel, said something came up at work, something always comes up on new year's eve with her. I expected it to take about five minutes to dismantle your scheme then I would go enjoy my night. Maybe go downtown to watch the ball drop."

Dr. Neutron rose from his seat. "Why would you lower yourself to being down there with them? You get a much better view from up here, better soundtrack too." With a snap of his fingers the house lights rose while the curtain peeled back on the small stage, a string quartet softly filled the air with classical music. A small aerial drone waiter brought over a fresh bottle of champagne on ice with two glasses.

Fuzion groaned. Another one of Dr. N's over the top "Romance Traps." what a dork, had to give him credit, he spared no expense. He spent more time devising these than any evil plan to strike fear into the heart of Star City. Only a select few people in the world knew that Dr. Neutron was the real power behind the schmucks, he pulled all the strings, made his puppets dance to the beat of his war drum. He and Fuzion were two sides of the same coin, so they fought on the edge. A perfect stalemate.

Dr. Neutron popped the cork of the new bottle of champagne and filled their glasses. The clink of crystal pierced the music in the air. "Would you like to make a toast or shall I?" Neutron asked.

"Cheers to one drink than I'm leaving. You do look nice all put together like that. Normally your hair looks like a crappy bird's nest." Fuzion smiled.

"I'll drink to that. You're welcome to stay for dinner if you'd like. It's cold out there, a nice home cooked meal will warm you up. Belinda the Butcheress is downstairs in the galley preparing chicken cordon bleu with garlic butter rice, red velvet cake for desert. All your favorites."

"How'd you get Belinda to do that?"

"She owed me a favor, have you ever had her cooking? It's exquisite."

Almost on cue dinner was served. A royal feast. Wonderful dinner conversation, stories of old capers mixed with some insider gossip about the supers and the schmucks. After dinner Dr. Neutron extended his hand and bowed.

"Would you care to dance?" he asked. The classical compositions of the quartet changed tempo, a slow melody played out.

"I can't dance." Fuzion smirked.

"I'll lead. I won't step on your toes if you don't step on mine."

Fuzion begrudgingly agreed. The two twirled slowly around the dance floor.

"May I propose something to you?" Dr. N asked quietly.

"No, I will not marry you." Fuzion laughed.

"That wasn't what I was going to ask. Something more pressing and important than that." Dr. N stopped the dance, he pulled Fuzion in a little closer.

"Shoot" Fuzion whispered.

"A yearly detente between the two sides. Pack away our prejudices and presumptions to begin the year anew, a fresh start. Super and schmuck joining hands, not clashing fists. I can't do that alone, I need a partner. I can think of no more capable partner than you, nor one as lovely."

Before an answer could escape Fuzion's lips the house lights shut off, a piercing klaxon rang from Dr. Neutron's breast pocket. "Quickly now, this is the best part." Dr. Neutron grasped Fuzion's hand and dashed over to the window. Splashes of color exploded in the sky underneath the zeppelin, the fireworks flooding the hall with every color of the rainbow. The quartet played 'Auld Lang Syne' to accompany the light show.

Sparks flew from the passionate kiss Fuzion planted on the Doc's lips. "Happy new year. Let me sleep on it, here's my number. Call me tomorrow. Thanks for dinner."

As silently as she arrived Fuzion departed. Having a bird's eye view of the world comes in handy sometimes. You never know where you'll find the most unlikely of allies, or the most unlikely of lovers. Flip a coin long enough and eventually, it will land on its side.
