"Drop me off right here. I'll walk the rest of the way." Detective Falcona had the rookie pull the squad car over at the entrance to the gated community of cookie cutter houses. "Have a good night officer, drive safe in this weather."

Falcona pulled her pork pie hat down to shield her face from the swirling snow. She flashed her badge at the security guard. She lit a smoke as she strolled through the silent neighborhood, Christmas lights twinkled in the cold December air. Falcona's phone vibrated.

'ARE YOU ALMOST HERE!? :( :( :('

Falcona picked up the pace. She was gathering her thoughts, she was walking into a minefield, wanted to be ready for anything. She flicked her smoke into the street as she trudged up the driveway. She knocked loudly out of habit.

"Thank the gods you're here Falco!" Dr. Neutron could barely be heard over the shrieking cry that shook the walls. Doc looked tired, his terrycloth robe drooped around his shoulders, a pair of boxers the only thing underneath. His normally wacky hairstyle even more outrageous, salt and pepper hair exploded from his skull.

Falco removed her trench coat and hat revealing her soft plaid red and green pajamas. "What's up doc? Sounds like you've got a situation on your hands. Cavalry has arrived." Falcona pointed upstairs where the crying was coming from. "My sis upstairs?"

Dr. Neutron nodded. "Sarah's been having a tantrum for two hours now, hard to reason with a four year old. When it rains it pours."

Falcona ascended the steps, shrieking cries growing louder closer to the summit. She popped into her niece's bedroom, children's drawings of dinosaurs plastered the walls. Glow in the dark stars dotted the ceiling. In the blink of an eye tiny arms wrapped around Falcona's legs. She bent down and tussled her niece Atomic Girl's pale orange hair.

Falcona shot her gaze across the room to her sister Fuzion. She looked distraught. Her eyes pleaded for help. Not even the most powerful super in the city could control an angry little girl who could rearrange atoms at will. Falcona bent down and hugged her niece.

"What seems to be the problem here young lady?" She asked.

"Mom and Dad are making me go to bed! I want to see santy claws!" The young girl crossed her arms defiantly.

Falcona took a seat on her niece's bed, it was covered with dinosaur plushes. She patted the free space between her and Fuzion. Sarah plopped down between the two. Falcona softly tilted her pouting niece's chin up.

"I used to do the same thing when I was your age sweetie. Fight off the sandman while listening for those reindeer hooves on the roof, see if I can catch the fat man coming down the chimney. I needed to ask him a question."

Sarah cocked her head quizzically. "What did you want to ask santy claws?"

"How come I didn't get what I asked for? I was always a good little girl. I ate my vegetables, got good grades, and always listened to my ma and pa. Why was he holding out on me?" Falcona threw her hands in the air in confusion.

"What did you want santy claws to bring you?"

Falcona smiled, she tapped the play button on her phone, a smooth jazz melody wafted into the air. Falcona sang sometimes at Paul's piano bar, she had a sultry singing voice.

*I want a hippopotamus for Christmas*

*Only a hippopotamus will do*

*I don't want a doll, no dinky Tinkertoy*

*I want a hippopotamus to play with and enjoy*

Fuzion softly sang along.

*I want a hippopotamus for Christmas*

*I don't think Santa Claus will mind, do you?*

*He won't have to use our chimney flue*

*Just bring him thorugh the front door*

*That's the easy thing to do*

The carol calmed the air. Sarah went out like a light. The two sisters tucked her in and quietly crept downstairs. Dr. Neutron was waiting in the kitchen, a fresh pot of coffee brewing. The three stood in silence, not a creature was stirring. The three breathed a sigh of relief. They clinked their mugs in celebration.

"Who would ever believe the city's most hardboiled detective is secretly the world's greatest tamer of tantruming toddlers." Dr. Neutron chuckled. That gave Falcona her opening to test out her theory. With a flick of her wrist she popped the neon green pacifier into his open lips and squeezed his mouth shut. Soft snoring ensued. She laid Dr. Neutron's head down softly on the kitchen table.

Fuzion stifled a laugh, she almost choked on her coffee. "Where did you get that?"

"Little sleeping aid I *borrowed* from Will O' The Wisp. Heard it through the grapevine she and Nighthawk are into some kinky stuff that perverts the very nature of childlike innocence. Swear every year the supers and the schmucks get weirder. No offense." Falcona kicked her slipper covered feet up on the table.

"None taken. Funny that a kid who's been surrounded by people more than human believes in Santa Claus. Teleporting across the entire world visiting every house via reindeer, that's a hell of a power to have." Fuzion yawned, she didn't need any sleep aids.

"Says the human particle accelerator. You and Doc doing good? Been a while since we've had some time to talk privately." Falcona spoke softly, only loud enough to be heard over the snoring.

"It's tough keeping it a secret but we manage. He thinks the world of Sarah, and I think he likes me too." Fuzion giggled. "Sooner or later it will all make sense, all fall into place. Then we can get together like a normal family for the holidays. No more cloak and dagger shit."

"We ain't never been or gonna be a normal family sis. That's what makes it so special. My work here is done, I'm gonna head back home, gotta feed Bastet. Love you. Merry Christmas."

Falcona retrieved the pacifier from the sound asleep doctor. She donned her coat and hat, stepping back out into the swirling snowstorm. She radioed in for a squad car to pick her up. The supers and schmucks of Star City were as unique as the snowflakes that fell to Earth, Falcona learned many years ago how to be flexible, no battle is unwinnable, one only needs to know when to use a soft touch and some grace. When dancing on the razor's edge, be careful where you step.
