War's battlefields take place not only on shelled ground under burning skies but the entirety of one's being. Ancient berserkers fought in the nude, used their enemies blood as war paint as they slaughtered them to satiate their bloodlust. To open the doors of Valhalla. The Aztec quaquachictin never retreated despite taking up the most dangerous positions. All so they could dance with the courtesans after the battle. Suicide bombers of the past killed for martyrdom. For seventy two virgins. They all fought for something. Everything I fought for is dead right before my very eyes.

The drones bombing run annihilated our defenses. My brothers in arms became nothing but scattered body parts and charred corpses floating in muddy blood. Somehow I had survived, but not for much longer. I kept the piece of metal shrapnel in my gut as I ripped open all the pill packs I could scavenge from my fallen family. I chewed the pills like candy as I strapped anything that could explode onto my fatigues. 

I could hear the heavy tank treads coming to clean up any survivors. One final charge, take some of those bastards down with me, it wouldn't come close to matching how many of my family they had killed. Didn't matter. I had nothing left to fight for, history would not remember me sixty seconds from now.
