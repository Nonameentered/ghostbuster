KA! ME! HA! ME! HAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!! Dust swirled as the massive ki blast streaked across the desert sands. A direct hit to the ki condenser Walter and Jessie had constructed in the capsule corp. van model four. Their power levels were low, Goku couldn't use instant transmission. He flew over to join in the celebration.

"Wow Mr. White you might be almost as smart as Bulma!" Goku cheerily said.

"Yo she is one smart milf but she's got nothin on Mr. White!" Jesse fistbumped Goku.

"Quiet you two. Don't start celebrating yet." Walter retrieved the processed product from the ki condenser. A brilliant blue marble sized orb glowed in the sunlight. Success, ninety nine percent pure ki.

Walter held the power of the saiyans in his hand, Frieza would no longer be a problem for him.
