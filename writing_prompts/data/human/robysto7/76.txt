Bryan Harper was next in line for a chance at redemption. Sixty seven years old when he perished from the mortal coil. Suicide. Bit the barrel of a gun. No known relatives in the afterlife, his entire lineage caught in the cycle of reincarnation.

The administrator laid out the ground rules for Mr. Harper, his was a new soul that had never entered the spiral of reincarnation.

"Here's how this works. Before you can move forward on the journey into the great beyond you must take on one final task on the mortal coil. You'll want to think hard about this. You will be returned to an exact moment of your life prior to your demise. You then make a choice to set right your biggest wrong. If you are successful you move on in the great journey. If not, you have to live all over again on the mortal coil. Do you have any questions?" The administrator inquired.

"What do you mean by successful?" Bryan asked.

"That's the tricky thing about that word, it can mean a lot of things. This isn't meant to be easy, the great beyond only accepts certain souls."

Bryan shook his head, his mind was swirling. Asking him to find the biggest mistake of his life is like asking him to find the biggest grain of sand on the beach. Much less fix it. The question of 'where did it all go wrong?' was a common one in his mind before he blew his brains out. One moment started to crawl back into his mind. Before he could give an answer a brilliant flash of white exploded into a dark, stormy night.

Bryan's eyes were drooping. His head felt heavy. A small amount of vomit came up when he burped, he spit it out the window of his old Chevy muscle car. The car was trying to warm up while being pelted with freezing rain, get the cigarette lighter hot enough. A searing pain coursed through Bryan's throat. He'd lit the wrong end, the stench of burning cotton filled the air.  He tossed the cigarette and lit another.

Bryan was only ten minutes from home, just needed to take it slow in the rain. No cabs were running this late. Not in this weather. Bryan tried to focus on the road; his vision impaired by the worn out wiper blades struggling to sweep the rain away. Being fifteen beers deep didn't help either.

A few minutes from Bryan's apartment was a sharp right turn where he'd almost wrecked multiple times. His lead foot was pushing the pedal down almost on it's own accord. As the Chevy sped towards the turn bright high beams blinded Bryan. Horns blared, brakes squealed, a thunderous crash came not from the sky, but from the twisted metal of the crash. A warm bright white light enveloped all creation, Bryan's soul returned to where it had been just moments ago.

The next step of the great journey was now open to him. It was unlike anything Bryan had ever experienced on the mortal coil. He got to watch the lives of the two people in the other car who perished because of Bryan's first try at life, they lived because of his second try.

Their lives told stories of love, happiness, sorrow, pain, and redemption. Full lives unknowingly gifted to them, all because of a choice they had no control over. Another "successful" ascension.
