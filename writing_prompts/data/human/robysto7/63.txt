Dr. Shelling's fingers flew across the keys inputting the new settings for the room. He and his team were so close, he was dying to get it right. His partner Dr. Franks peered over his shoulder. She tapped the monitor.

"I really think we should boost the quantum fluxuation stabilizer by at least eight percent."

"That's too risky, we've never overclocked it before." Dr. Shelling knew she was right but didn't want to risk any of the billion dollar equipment on scientific curiosity without a proper test first.

"I know it's a risk but we need the extra resolution."

Dr. Shelling boosted the quantum fluxuation stabilizer. He leaned back in his chair as the computer ran a virtual simulation. "Hope that doesn't bring any unforeseen consequences. This has to work this time, right?" Dr. Shelling asked.

"We're almost there, it's wriggled off the hook every time we've snagged it. I think we've built a better hook now."

*Bing bong! Bing Bong!*

Virtual simulation results returned an eighty-eight percent success rate with the new settings. Most systems in the green, quantum field actuator would perform sub-optimal under these conditions. The two ran with it. Dr. Franks made the call.

"Bring in subject fifty four."

Three cross wielding priests led the test subject into the pitch black testing room. Once the priests were sequestered Dr. Shelling flipped the switch to open the roof. The timer started. The frail malnourished vampire clawed at the steel walls while it's fleshed smoked from the searing heat. Room sensors remained stable.

The tapping of Dr. Frank's foot kept time with the tapping of Dr. Shelling's fingers. As the test subject thrashed alarm bells rang out in the control room. Four minutes left on the timer.

"Seal it up!" Dr. Frank yelled.

The blast shield lowered over the control room window, the roof shuttered. Monitor after monitor came online. Infrared. Ultraviolet. Night Vision. Fluctuation readings spiked. The control room shook violently. It was slamming against the blast shield.

Infrared eyes stared into the camera, chilling the two Drs. to the bone. Equipment was holding up, they'd done it. Whatever it was had taken control of the test subject. Scorched vocal chords rasped demands.

"Releasssse me."

"What are you?" Dr Franks asked through the PA system. She was frantically adjusting the plank distributor values.

"Eternal. Beyond the veil of your comprehenssssion, your very reality. Releasssse me."

Breakers popped, red emergency lights flooded the control room a crimson red. The quantum entrapment cage took a lot of power to work. The backup camera still worked. Dr. Shelling laughed in triumph. Dr. Franks was already on the phone.

"Anomaly captured. Recovery team alpha and bravo please."

The two doctors were awarded the nobel prize in physics. They revolutionized humanity's ability to understand how the very fabric of the universe is weaved. Humanity's grasp exceeds its reach. The cosmic doorway now lay open, and something wicked this way comes.
