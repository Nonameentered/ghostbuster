Detective Falcona loudly burst through the door of the small cozy waiting room of Star City's rapidly rising therapist to the supers and the schmucks; Dr. Druef. Her trench coat billowed behind her revealing her impeccably tailored grey three piece suit. Raindrops dripped from the brim of her pork pie hat. She produced a rolled up stack of papers from her breast pocket. She cleared her throat to get the receptionist's attention, she hadn't looked up from her phone during Falcona's dramatic entrance.

Tight little blond broad. Cute face to welcome the doctor's patients. Her ice blue eyes shot up from the phone.

"Can I help you? Doctor isn't taking on any more patients at this time. I can put you on the waiting list, it's long." She said flatly.

Detective Falcona waved the papers in the air. "Gotta talk to the doc. Judge's orders. He with someone right now?" She asked.

"Yes." She replied curtly.

"I'll wait. I got time." Falcona hung her coat and hat up, long raven hair with a few streaks of grey cascaded past her shoulders. She lit up a smoke and held the softpack out to the receptionist. "You want one doll face?" She asked.

She accepted the offer, Detective Falcona lit it for her so she could get a better look at her. She was in good shape, looked like she could hold her own. Falcona leaned against the desk.

"Bet you see a lot of interesting faces walk through those doors. Doc paying you enough to keep those kind of secrets?"

"Pays the bills. All I see are normal people struggling to make sense of it all, nothin else."

"Who's in there right now?" Falcona asked offhandedly.

"Why would I tell you that?" The broad was sharp.

"Already had a little peek at the doc's client list. I already know who's in there, just wanted to see if you would crack that easy. He check in under Nathan West? Or he is indulging his ego checking in as Nighthawk?" Smoke swirled from Falcona's lips as she spoke.

"The former."

"Wanna know what they're talking about?" Falcona smirked.

"You really are connected to everybody is this city aren't you?" Smart broad too.

"It's complicated, innocent dame like you wouldn't understand. I've known Nathan quite a while. He thinks he's in love with Will O' The Wisp, couldn't be farther from the truth. She's been playing with his heart through synthetic pheromones harvested from genetically modified flowers for years now. Residual effects from long term dosing. Kissing him is her preferred transfer vector, can't blame Nathan for wanting to kiss those lips, she's a good kisser. I'll bet ya a sawbuck he's in there crying about being in love with the woman that killed his brother."

Falcona dropped a few more nuggets of insider information for the dame. She seemed to be interested in it. Falcona was right, after twenty minutes Nathan 'Nighthawk' West emerged from the office. His eyes bloodshot, veins bulging against the whites. Falcona strode past without acknowledging him into the doctor's office, loudly slamming the door behind her.

Dr. Druef was still seated in his large burgundy leather chair opposite the matching chaise lounge. A friendly air surrounded him, he dressed like Mr. Rogers, shared his friendly demeanor with him too. That's what the public saw, Falcona knew the truth. Dr. Druef seemed unfazed by this intrusion. He waved Falcona over to the chaise lounge.

"Hello Detective, make yourself comfortable."

Falcona leaned up against the leather lounge and scribbled down a message on the blank pieces of paper in her breast pocket.

'TURN OFF ANY RECORDING DEVICES'

A hidden panel slid open from the doctor's chair. A series of button presses deactivated the cameras, microphones, and the sensors hidden in the chaise lounge. Detective Falcona turned off her hidden dictophone. She sat on the chaise lounge and crossed her legs.

The doc opened his notebook, pen at the ready. "How can I help you Falco?"

"My friends call me Falco, so don't call me that. This is a courtesy visit, not official so listen closely to what I have to tell you. Keep your hand out of the fucking cookie jar, you're gonna ruin your appetite. This is the only warning. Don't let me catch you again. Stay in your lane, do your fucking job, no more extracurricular activities. We clear?" Falcona growled out. She lit another smoke, making sure the plume wafted directly into the doc's nostrils.

"I'm helping these people Detective. Super beings can't be out there struggling with mental illness, that would be catastrophic! The human mind is unprepared for the consequences that come with being more than human, I'm blazing a path for them towards stable, healthy mental states. You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs." Dr. Druef replied.

Detective Falcona rolled her eyes and shrugged her slender shoulders. "You don't get it doc. Vigilantism ain't gonna solve the problems we got in this city. The supers and the schmucks are pieces on a board playing a game we can only watch. Don't interfere with it. Most people don't see the reality of this city, it's covered in a fine gossamer web. Intricate and delicate, each thread branches out and slowly spreads to catch its prey.

Them threads are load bearing. You cut one without knowing where it goes, something else collapses. I've spent decades learning where each thread goes, just like my father did before me. Don't rock the boat doc or we're all gonna fall in the ocean. Do your fucking job and help the supers and the schmucks come to terms with their problems in this office and this office alone. Leave my streets to me, I don't need help to do my job of cleaning up the real mess. The murderers, the pimps, the human traffickers, and the rest of the trash that litters the streets. While they're busy peering over their shoulder looking for a supe, I'm cuffing their hands behind their backs." Detective Falcona rose from the lounge slowly. She narrowed her smoky hazel eyes at the doctor.

His head bobbed slowly, deep in thought. "What are you gonna do to stop me? I've got a squadron of heroes and villains under my thumb. You wouldn't stand a chance." A sinister laugh seeped from sneered lips.

Detective Falcona pulled her trump card from the other breast pocket of her suit jacket. "I serve this RICO warrant and toss your quack ass into federal prison for thirty years. No outside communication, not even a window to look out of. I know from a reliable source that's it is not a pleasant place to be. Stay in your fucking lane from now on, don't make me come back here with backup. Fuzion says you're a good shrink, thanks for helping her, she's a good gal."

Without waiting for objection Detective Falcona returned to the lobby. That pretentious little prick Magnetron was flirting with the dame behind the desk. He must have just gotten into town, he usually spent his summers in the kingdom of Wanovia. Falcona interrupted the two.

"Hey Magnet boy, long time no see." Falcona slapped the young schmuck on the back causing his liquid metal armor to ripple. Cool effect.

"Ah! The lovely Detective! You look more ravishing each time our paths cross, didn't know cougars prowled in autumn." Magnetron's metal mask morphed into a kissy face.

Detective Falcona ignored his poor attempt at flirting to retrieve her coat and hat. She pointed her hat at the receptionist. "Boss says you can clock out early today doll. I'm going over to Paul's Piano Bar for an early happy hour. Wanna come?" She asked.

Raindrops dripped from the gossamer net that kept the lid on the powderkeg, the burning wick extinguished for another day. Heroes flew above the storm clouds, normal gumshoes get pelted with the liquid arrows on the battlefield against a never ending threat, Falcona wouldn't have it any other way.
