Big band music swelled in the dance hall; all eyes were on the happy couple sharing their first dance. Never thought the Don would invite me to his daughter's wedding, much less cater the whole affair. I was enjoying a nice scotch and cigar with Frankie. We took bets on how long it would be before the Don had the groom whacked. I gave him six months, Frankie gave him two years. Easiest bet I ever took.

Jimmy Boglia walked over to us, the rules really were different now. The consigliere don't talk to mooks like us.

"Don wants to see ya. Come with me kid." Jimmy was stern and direct. We went to the back office of the dance hall. A dark smoky room. Don Gracino was counting out a large stack of money to stuff into envelopes. Party favors for the guests. He didn't say a word to me, only pointed at the chair across the desk. He poured me another glass of scotch, the kind he drank, real expensive.

I lit a cigar for the Don, he was much more imposing up close. A brick shithouse of a human being, you had to be to take on the wackos in this city. The Don held his glass up high.

"Salute." He downed the drink quickly.

I sipped mine. Wanted to savor the high quality booze.

Don cleared his throat. "Wanted to thank you personally for all you've done for the family these past two years. I knew you always made one hell of a good sandwich and top notch cannolis, didn't know you was so smart to boot. Genius idea bribing the fire chief and city officials to get them wackos little playhouse condemned. That building ain't never getting back up to code, we're making sure of that. Is it true what you told Paulie?"

Paulie was my go-between with the higher ups. Fed him information about the supers and the schmucks. People tend to let their guard down in a friendly neighborhood deli, especially after a nice meal.

"I tell Paulie a lot of stuff, anything specific you want to know about?"

"Is Captain Liberty really afraid of mayonnaise?"

"Terrified of it."

Don Gracino almost coughed up a lung from laughing so hard, maybe he was human. "You keep this up kid and you'll be a made man in no time. The more information you provide, the more we can exploit those idiot heroes and delusional villains. Take control of this city again. Consider this a bonus for your hard work slingin sandwiches."

Don gave me a bottle of scotch and a large envelope full of money. Keep playing my cards right and this whole town will be mine one day. The way to a person's heart is through their stomach and I always cooked with love.
