Paul's Piano Bar in the heart of Star City was famous for good music, great drinks, big laughs, and a place to spot your favorite super or schmuck, it was the only neutral ground in the city. Detective Falcona sat in her usual back booth, you couldn't miss her bright red three piece suit and long raven hair. She sipped her scotch chatting with the bartender Victoria before her shift started. Detective Falcona tied the bow tie of her tuxedo uniform for her. Victoria tussled her long red hair, she looked good, she made good tips.

"How do I look?" Victoria asked.

"Gorgeous as always Vic. Can you do me a favor?" Falcona lit up a smoke and finished her drink.

"Can do. Another round?" Vic flashed a warm smile.

"Yes please but something more important. Bout twenty minutes from now the new super on the block will be coming through the side door. Send him my way please. He drinks rum and coke. Thanks doll."

Detective Falcona had done some digging on the newcomer, she wasn't happy with what she found. She needed to have a chat with him. Right on cue Victoria escorted him to the back booth with a fresh round of drinks. Falcona shook his icy hand.

"Have a seat kid. Do you go by 'The Frozen Shadow' or do your friends call you Klaxorn?" She asked.

The Frozen Shadow's crystalline exoskeleton was covered head to toe by a long trench coat and wide brimmed fedora hat. Frosty eyes fogged from behind a black domino mask. A deep voice bellowed from behind the flaps of the coat.

"You really are a good detective. Pleasure to meet you."

Falcona clinked her glass against the super's. "Right back at ya. Now that we've dispensed with the pleasantries let me get right to business. Stay in your fucking lane kid! This is the only warning I'm gonna give you. Are we clear?" A plume of smoke masked her face while she spoke.

"Pardon me? Where do you get off telling me that? Know your place detective." Frozen shadow shot back.

"Listen here you fucking twat, you're getting in my way. Why did you hang Jimmy Barino upside down from the roof of Neutron technologies?" She asked.

"He was part of an alien tech smuggling ring, I squeezed him for information. I suspected my nemesis Quizzler was behind it." Frozen Shadow said proudly.

"Jimmy Barino was one of my CI's you fucking moron! That wasn't alien tech, it was old designs from a raid on one of Neutron's old labs. We were following them to see who they would contact to fix it! Entire organization went underground, they had a lot of fingers in a lot of pies. Narcotics, human trafficking, money laundering, a whole laundry list. Was gonna bring em all up on RICO charges, forty to life.

You understand what kind of power vacuum that creates? Every schmuck in this fucking town is looking to move in. Will O' The Wisp is taking over the east side, Vinny Venom is expanding south, city center is gonna be a warzone in few weeks because you didn't use your fucking brain. Think with that, not your damn powers. I gotta clean up your mess now.

I've been around the block a lot kid, I got friends in incredible high and depressingly low places. Stay. In. Your. Lane. The schmucks make a doomsday device, you supers swoop in and save the city. They kidnap the mayor's daughter and you get to save a princess. Stay off the streets, those belong to me. I need the creeps looking over their shoulders for supers while I pounce from behind.

Before I let you get out of here I want you to listen closely. Don't underestimate me kid, I'm a tough broad. I choose to clean up the streets to allow people like you to patrol the clouds. Only clouds in Star City are stormclouds, so stay above em. Best of luck out there kiddo."

Detective Falcona finished her drink and slunk out of the booth. She tossed a stack of bills on the table. "Drinks are on me. In the spirit of our new found agreement I'll let ya in on something. Quizzler is out in the suburbs running a pyramid scheme scamming soccer moms. The product they push is stored in a warehouse out on 7th, might be worth a look."

Falcona stopped at the bar to say goodbye to Vic. Vic kissed her on the cheek. "I would hate to be on the other end of one of your dressing downs."

"Pecking order, some learn it sooner than others." Detective Falcona hoped she never had to stop giving her little speech to the supers and schmucks that didn't know their place in the delicate balance of Star City.
