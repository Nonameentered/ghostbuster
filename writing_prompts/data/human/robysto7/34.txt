The savage pounding of fists against thick glass echoed in the dark hull of the repurposed oil tanker that silently floated in Star City harbor. The flash of an overhead spotlight broke the darkness, a halo of light in an empty void. Starlight's tight yellow catsuit and flowing red cape brilliantly stood out against the spiderweb cracked glass containment cell. 

Metal against metal scratched from the shadows. As the shadowy figure sat crossed legged on the metal folding chair the spotlight grew in intensity, casting a soft light on Connor Chao's red lab coat and thick black boots. He removed his smoky tinted safety goggles, bright blue eyes twinkled back. He rubbed the quaffed blonde hair atop his chiseled face. 

"You're making an awful lot of noise in here. It's distracting me from my work. Is there a problem darling?" Connor Chao's voice was gently firm.

"Let me out of here! This isn't funny anymore! You're starting to scare me honey." Starlight's emerald eyes cried from behind her sequined domino mask.

"Sweetheart we need to talk. I want a divorce. You've become far too powerful to be left alive. Over these past fifteen years you've provided invaluable data for my magnum opus." Connor produced a cigar from his coat pocket, lighting it for a dramatic pause.

"You're bluffing. You have a shitty poker face." Starlight growled. 

"You always did interrupt my monologues, it's quite rude. Always hated that about you. We both knew this was a marriage of convenience, give the little people in the audience a good show. Ever changing alliances of good and evil struggling for all eternity to dazzle the eye and tickle the brain. 

Merely a means to an end. Should be proud of yourself dear, you're going to be their Eve in the new world I create. I am sorry you won't be able to see it, it's going to be beautiful. A paradise of survival of the fittest." Smoke swirled on Connor's words. 

"Don't say it........" Starlight's heart sank into her stomach, she fell to her knees.

"Operation evo three went into effect two nights ago. Have to wait a few months to see any results, I think I told you that."

"Why? Just why?" Starlight whispered.

"I cracked the code as to what makes us, well, us. Who am I to deny others the opportunity to be more than human? What will they do? How will they control it? Can they control it? Just think of me as Santa Clause giving gifts to all the kiddies, good and bad. If my calculations are correct after I absorb your powers I will be far and away more powerful than any of our "children" will be. I can keep an eye on them, make sure nobody can challenge their creator. 

Unfortunately I never found a way to keep you alive during the process, I ran countless simulations, crunched terabytes of data, sacrifice is the only avenue. I designed it to be painless when it happens. I'm sorry Starry, I did love you once." Connor's chiseled face drooped.

"Me too." Starlight choked out.

With the press of a button the glass cell collapsed inwards, engulfing Starlight. Her scream abruptly halted as it condensed into a glass orb no bigger than a marble. Connor plucked it from the floor, gently tossing it in the air. He slipped it into his coat pocket, wanted to run a few more tests on the condensed form of what makes one more human than human. 

Connor whistled a happy tune as he walked with a pepped up step back to the control deck of the ship, he needed to set a course for the brave new world on the horizon.
