***Promises***

Smooth jazz swirled with the smoke in the air at Paul's Piano Bar, most of it emanating from the cozy back booth, Detective Falcona's home away from home. She sat with her twin sister, Fuzion, Star City's most well regarded and heralded hero, for their yearly birthday gift exchange. While twins at birth, the two were now vastly different on account of Connor Chaos' devious experiments done to them during their youth. Fuzion's dull orange skin tone matched her hair and eyes, a stark contrast to the detective's pale skin against raven black and grey hair shrouding ice blue eyes.

Fuzion gave her gift first, a small package wrapped in old christmas wrapping paper. The green nuclear fire in her pupils roared as she handed the present over. Detective Falcona immediately started to unwrap it. Fuzion scoffed. "Not even going to take a guess? Come on. Let's see if my sis is still the world's greatest detective and villain to every schmuck in Star City."

Falcona sipped her scotch, gently shaking the present. "Based on its weight, size, and that it don't rattle when I shake it, this is a hard drive, probably the one I asked you to retrieve from Vicky Venom's animal testing lab." She said matter of factly. The fire behind Fuzion's eyes dimmed, her sister was right, as always. "Thanks sis. This should help me track down her suppliers, get a better picture of the whole operation she's part of. Another home run on the present front. Let's hope mine is half as good."

Falcona retrieved a ring box from the inside breast pocket of her all black three piece suit, gently placing it on the table. Hopefully good things really do come in small packages. Fuzion opened the box to retrieve the ring, a simple white gold band adorned with a dull green emerald. She held up her left hand to compare, it was an exact match of her engagement ring. She held her hand close to her sister's face.

"Did that fucker give me a fake engagement ring?" Fuzion asked, it wouldn't be out of character for her husband, Dr. Neutron, to do such a thing.

Falcona laughed. "Your ring is very much the real deal, Neut spent a fortune on it, I helped him pick it out. This one has a special surprise built in. Put it on and twist the jewel on top." Falcona popped a cigarette in her lips but didn't light it. She intently watched Fuzion slip the ring on. "Small warning, it might sting."

With a small twist of the emerald, Fuzion's world changed. The dull orange glow that surrounded her faded away, returning her back to the woman she once was, her hair and eyes returning to their natural black and blue. A wave of helplessness ran through Fuzion's soul, her muscles felt weak, her vision clouded with tears. She peered through the watery haze at the identical face staring back at her. Falcona leaned in. "Can you light this for me?" She asked while bobbing the smoke in her lips.

Fuzion snapped her fingers. Normally this would produce a small green flame, now, nothing. Not even a spark. Fuzion tried again. And again. And again. Nothing, her powers were gone. Her hands quaked violently, she was scared. Her sister's warm hands enveloped hers, calming them. With the speed of a pickpocket Falcona slipped the ring off her finger onto hers. Fuzion's eyes screamed with confusion.

"What the hell?" Was all she could muster.

Falcona lit her cigarette. "I made a couple promises to pa a long time ago. One, that I would always protect this city once he couldn't any longer. Two, that I would always protect you. Little did I know you would end up fulfilling both of those promises for me. I know you don't want to do it forever sis, so my gift to you is the gift of choice." A small stream of smoke escaped Falcona's lips, ominously hanging in the air.

"Thanks sis. I can't accept this though. The city still needs me, needs us." Fuzion sighed. She studied her face in the small makeup mirror she procured from her purse.

Falcona shut her eyes tightly, taking a deep breath, she expected this to hurt. She turned the jewel back to its original position. A searing wave of fire burned through her veins, the explosion of atoms boomed in her synapses. Power beyond description pulsed through every quark of her being, a flash of light popped as Falcona's skin, hair, and eyes changed. She snapped her fingers, a ball of green flames danced in her palm.

"So that's what it's like." Falcona chuckled. The clang of the makeup mirror against the table echoed in the air. Fuzion's jaw dropped, tears fell from her eyes. Nothing made sense to her, she couldn't remember the last time she felt....normal. She stared silently, watching Falcona toy around with her powers. After a few minutes Falcona returned to normal, she was out of breath and sweating profusely. Takes an enormous amount of effort to control such powerful forces. Falcona slipped the ring off, placing it in the center of the table.

"So if you ever want to stop doing the super thing, I can take it off your hands. Well, with a little practice that is. Shit's potent." Falcona smiled.

Fuzion plucked the ring from the table, studying it in the palm of her hand. "For so many years after I changed all I wanted was to be normal again. Time to time I still wish that. But I know that's not really what I want. Made a promise to my daughter on the day she was born, that I would build a better world for her, for everyone, I can only do that as Fuzion." She placed the ring back on her finger, har hand slowly hovering over the emerald.

An uncomfortable silence fell, it was soon broken by Falcona's shrill text notification. "Aw shit. Duty calls. Gotta run sis, happy birthday." Falcona grasped her trench coat lying next to her and rose from the booth.

"Trouble afoot?" Fuzion asked.

"CI just checked in. Got eyes on a new super in town, gonna go stake out her hangout, got a hunch she was responsible for putting a low level drug gang in the hospital, one that I needed for a bigger operation." Falcona put her coat and hat on, completing the pulp detective look.

"I'll tag along." Fuzion stated flatly, rising from the booth.

"You don't need to do that. Stakeouts can be pretty boring."

"It'll give me an excuse to spend some time with my sister again, like we used to. If it goes south, I'll watch your back." Fuzion waved the ring at her sister.

The two drove off into the night, Fuzion happy with the ability to return to normal on command. Detective Falcona excited that the contraption Fuzion's daughter built worked, the holidays were coming up. Falcona's christmas list was filled with supers and schmucks who might like a nice piece of jewelry.
