My best piece of advice for this story is to figure out who the protagonist is and how you want to convey the story to a reader. Is the female lead or the psychologist the protagonist? What do you mean by "where reality is"? Does being a divine figure give the psychologist divine powers? Or is this meant to be more grounded in reality and deal with psychological trauma?

There's a good idea here but it needs a lot of work. I don't understand what theme you're trying to convey to the reader or what emotional response you're looking for. It's a little murky, needs some filtering. Here's what popped into my head after reading it.

Dr. Morgan tapped his pen against the large oak desk, the monotonous tapping droned like a metronome. After a few moments of reflection he opened up the case file in front of him and began writing.

*Session eight with Amanda, no progress made. She is lagging behind my other patients by quite a large margin, most of them succumbed to the reality I was creating within four sessions. Yet she fights it, her mind rejects it, her fractured psyche is a minefield. The memoirs she brings to each session tell a different tale from the reality she inhabits.*

*Today's memoirs were from a young Nazi soldier stationed at Auschwitz. They told a gruesome tale of man's inhumanity to man in horrifying detail. The pages of the diary wept and wailed. Their death throes scrawled in blue ink on a deathly tome.*

*Each memoir she brings me tells similar stories. All the worst that humanity had to offer, desperate tales of desperate people. Sometimes the killer, sometimes the killed. Her mind an infinite hallway of doors, each one leading somewhere cruel.*

*I fear that I may to be too late in saving her. Maybe she also yields the power to shape her own world, maybe she understands the downtrodden and discarded members of her species. But why torture yourself if you didn't have to?*

*The other patients create utopias, places of great beauty and warmth. Why is she so different? What is she looking for?*

Keep on writing, the more you write the clearer the story becomes. Hope this helps.
