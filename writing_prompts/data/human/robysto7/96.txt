"Okay I think I got everything we need to get through this wall." I laid out the rented power tools next to the giant fresco mural that dominated the cathedral walls. A heavenly scene of angels and their creators. Me and my wife Caroline were gonna tear that damn thing down, see what was on the other side. Couple pickaxes, some chainsaws, a jackhammer, and a few sledgehammers should do the trick.

"I think you went a little overboard honey. Why don't we just smash the giant stained glass window? That would be easier."

"I like the window. This will be more fun to tear down I promise. If it's not then we can break the window."

"Deal." We shook on it and began the demolition. Smashing up a wall is a great stress reliever, we made good progress. The wall was getting weaker with each blow of the hammers, a pale green light shone through the cracks. With a mighty blow I cracked through the wall to the other side.

The monochrome world on the other side was familiar looking. A 1950's style kitchen, that future yet retro look to it. Two otherworldly creatures sat at a small kitchen table. Humanoid in shape and dressed like a businessman and housewife. Their heads were misshapen, their eyeballs were gripped by tiny hands that protruded from their skulls. Enormous mouths dominated noseless faces.

The one in the business suit walked over to me. "Did you just tear a fuckin hole in my wall?" The creature asked in a thick brooklyn accent. Its mouth was filled with razor sharp sharky teeth, its four arms flailed angrily.

"Sorry about that." I hoped whatever this thing was didn't eat human flesh.

"What are you even doin?"

"Me and my wife were curious as to what was on the other side of the mural. Our place is really roomy already but you'd never know it from the outside."

"Didn't you read the lease?" The creature barked out.

"I skimmed it."

"Rule eighty four a! No messin with the walls! These are load bearing walls. The load they bear is the weight of all space and time. Now you come along and rip a new tear in that fabric. Does your species know how to fix shit like this?" The creature was combative.

"Me personally? No. I can't really speak for everybody else though. Can you fix it?" It never hurt to ask.

The hands that manipulated the creature's eyeballs reached through the rip in space time and surveyed around. "Yes I can, do you know how long that is gonna take me though?" It asked.

"Nope, not a clue."

"Wow you really are behind the times on this side of the dimension. It'll take the blink of an eye, it's space time it can be wonky. Are you some kind of friggin moron? Don't they teach you that kind of stuff in preschool?"

This guy was an asshole. "I promise not to screw with space and time anymore. I'll be a better neighbor." Maybe that would get him to go away.

"Apology accepted. No more screwin with the walls, I don't spy on you, don't spy on me. Goodbye." The world seemed to wobble and shift. The fresco mural was back, completely restored.

Caroline was already heading over the stained glass window with a ladder under her arm. "Bring over a sledgehammer, now I really gotta see what's behind that window."
