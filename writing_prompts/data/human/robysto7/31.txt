I made sure the coffee was hot and the doughnuts laid out nicely before making sure each chair was spaced equidistant from one another in the circle of the community room of St. Paul's. I run the Wednesday night support group here, the color is purple, but any shade is welcome to attend.

I sipped my coffee and greeted the people as they trickled in. Lot of regulars tonight, couple new faces, seemed like word was getting around about the group. Everyone got settled in, the rain lightly pounded on the windows. I cleared my throat.

"Hope everybody had a happy hump day. Welcome back to those who have been here before, welcome to those who haven't. Any of the new faces like to introduce themselves? Don't be shy, we don't bite."

A young woman wrapped up in a yellow hoodie meekly raised her hand. "Hi. I'm Jenny, my skin turned purple about a month ago, my hair turned bright green soon after. I don't know what to do."

"Hi Jenny!" The crowd said in unison. She was the only new face to volunteer.

"Welcome aboard Jenny. Everyone is this room knows that feeling, you're not alone. I've been light purple going on six years now after being treated for my rainbow bacterial infection. You don't have to answer if you feel uncomfortable, what's the worst thing you've been called?" I asked this question to every newcomer sooner or later. Never ceases to amaze me how cruelly creative people are.

Jenny sniffled. "Dino. I'm just a big dumb purple dinosaur to them."

"That's a deep cut. I didn't think people still remembered the Flintstones. People call me something old school too. I'm the Count, ha! ha! ha!" I dramatically mimed fluttering a cape, brought a small smile to her face.

Tony laughed. "Try being a big fat hairy Italian purple guy. "Ey Grimace where's the Hamburgler?" Been hearing that one for almost twenty years."

Betty laughed along. "Oh please Tone, that's no worse than being a plus sized purple girl. I'm Ursula the sea witch to people."

Jeremy laughed so hard coffee spewed from his nose. "I'd trade for that in an instant. Be lucky you didn't have the mutation that gave you green spots. Being Barney is way more annoying. I feel for the chick."

I put a lid on the conversation. "We could be here all night discussing that topic. Let's get back on track. Susan do you want to continue where you left off last week? We were discussing your newfound anxiety about grape jelly, how that's what you think your blood looks like now?" I captained the ship carefully on stormy waters with my faithful crew of purple pirates; navigating the brave new world.
