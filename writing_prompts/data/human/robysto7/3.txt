***Tools of the Trade***

"Honey, why is our child building a death ray?" Fuzion asked while brushing her teeth. Her husband, Dr. Neutron rapidly shook his head swishing his mouthwash, his unkempt grey hair a blur. A torrent of spit plopped into the sink, Dr Neutron smiled and gave his wife a peck on the cheek.

"Death ray is a bit of a misnomer. It's merely a tool, a long range delivery system of Sarah's powers. Any tool in less scrupulous hands can be deadly. You can use a hammer to build a shelter, or smash it against a skull, all about how you use it." Neutron replied cockily. 

"She's twelve, have you ever been a twelve year old girl, honey?" Fuzion replied still brushing her teeth.

"Can't say that I have, wouldn't want to be." Neutron replied.

"We still don't know how powerful she really is. What's gonna happen when hormones really kick in? I don't think we need to add to her arsenal." Fuzion kissed her husband as the two tucked into bed. "Back to my original question, why is she building this thing?"

Neturon sighed, turning to gaze into his wife's eyes. Dim green nuclear flames glowed behind orange irises in the dark bedroom. "I suggested we build it. She's not gonna be my little girl forever, its like fixing up an old car with your dad over summer vacation. A memory that lasts a lifetime." 

"You fix up an old beater with your pa, doc?" Fuzion giggled.

"Something better. Me and the old man fixed up the war zeppelin, really got that girl humming. Scientific curiosity is the only thing Sarah and I share, at least that's what I feel." Neutron said listfully.

"That's not true, you know that." Fuzion lightly bopped her husband's nose. It didn't elicit a reaction.

"The only thing I know is that I know nothing. Leave that to the philosophers. She's a kind, loving, generous person. Just like her mother. The only reason this device could be considered a tool of destruction is because that is what most people would use it for. Not her, never even crosses her mind." Neutron said proudly.

"What exactly does this thing do then?" Fuzion inquired.

"What doesn't it do would be a more pertinent question. Using your particle acceleration powers as a fuels source the device manipulates matter on a sub-atomic level using my quantum manipulation powers from a distance. No need to be up close anymore. A handheld way to control matter at its fundamental level. Want to know the first idea she had for it?" 

"Fire away." Fuzion cuddled up closer.

"Use it on desolate farmland, rearrange the composition of the soil to make it suitable for growing crops. Help fight world hunger. After that she wants to expand it's capabilities to tackle climate change. Not what I would do with it." Neutron chuckled.

"What would the good doctor use it for?" Fuzion asked sleepily.

"Turn lead into gold. Become a real life alchemist. Glad she's in charge of the device. Apple didn't fall far from the tree, glad she takes after you." 

"And I'm glad the rotten apple didn't spoil the bunch. Just have her build a fail safe please, I'm glad you two are having fun on your project. Night honey." Fuzion said with a kiss.

"Night, darling." 

The two drifted off to slumber, Neutron dreamed of the ways he would utilize the growing amount of advanced technology his daughter was inventing. Fuzion dreamed of puppies.
