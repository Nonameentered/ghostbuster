I bobbed my head to the smooth jazz, I liked this convenient store's track. It made standing in line more tolerable. I swear I'm always stuck behind somebody with no plan on what else they need when they checkout. How many scratch off tickets does one person need? The music was about to start looping this was taking so long. 

Except today it didn't loop, thunderous drums banged and crashed. Sinister strings screeched. An ominous buildup to a roaring crescendo! The choir's voice booming from beyond the clouds, they sang a warning in a foreign tongue. I recognized one word. A name.

SEPH-I-ROTH! SEPH-I-ROTH!

I snatched a bag of doritos and bolted outside, the clouds parted, the sky darkened. A fallen god descended from the heavens. Grotesquely beautiful in form, truly worthy of such a foreboding sonic herald. I snacked on a chip. Things were about to get interesting.
