The trial of Star City vs Doctor Dark Matter was coming to a close. Closing arguments were finished, all that was left was the jury's decision.

"How has the jury found the defendant?" Judge Collins asked.

"We find the defendant not guilty of all charges."

Leonard Lawrence, esq, had done it again. Another appeal freed another criminal unjustly imprisoned because of a legal system that was in love with the heroes. Leonard quickly exited the courtroom, nature called. He studied himself in the mirror while he washed his hands. Checked his teeth, fixed his tie, wanted to look good for the media, they were swarming outside.

Dr. Dark Matter was waiting for Leonard at the elevator. The Dr. had never felt so relieved. He was beaming. "Thanks for getting me off of that bogus charge. You need anything, and I mean anything. I'm your man. Doomsday weapons, henchmen, emotional support. Whatever you want I can deliver." Dr. Dark Matter's offer was very generous.

Leonard shrugged it off. "I'm not in that business anymore. I fight for justice now. Justice for people like us. The legal system has failed us for far too long. I'm going to change that."

"Never would have imagined hearing those words from Horus the Hypnotist."

"Please don't call me that, that was a lifetime ago. Smile for the media. Just let me do all the talking." Leonard confidently strode through the lobby of the courthouse out through the large glass front doors. Cameras and microphones immediately violated any semblance of personal space. Questions smashed into one another, a hideous cacophony. Leonard looked over the mass of reporters, his steely gaze caused them to fall silent.

"Let me say to all the good people of Star City that justice has once again triumphed! My client will once again breathe free after suffering years of mistreatment from not only the courts, but the prison system, and the so called "heroes" that blatantly flaunt the law! Everyone is due their day in court. Speaking of which if anyone watching needs a good lawyer visit my website at [lollaw.com](https://lollaw.com)! Once again that's [lollaw.com](https://lollaw.com)! No further questions." Leonard pushed his way down the steps and confidently strolled to the parking garage.

Leonard ascended the steps up to the roof of the garage, he needed to get some exercise. Sitting in a courtroom all day didn't really burn calories well. Leonard had a surprise waiting for him on the roof, somebody had removed all the cars except for his. He tossed his leather briefcase in the trunk and got in the driver's seat. He adjusted the rear-view mirror to look in the backseat. Piercing emerald eyes behind a black domino mask stared back. Her flowing red hair cascading into her red cape, the black spandex suit hugged her curves.

Leonard chuckled. "How nice to see you Samantha, or are you on the clock right now? Should I address you as Scarlet Shadow?"

"What's your endgame Horus?" Scarlet Shadow growled.

"Do you want to come sit up front? I'd rather have this conversation face to face. Better yet, I'm going to get some fresh air, join me." The two leaned against the railing of the roof looking over the city.

"Spit it out, what are you after? I'm not buying this "Justice is blind" lawyer shit." Scarlet Shadow couldn't accept her nemesis doing anything altruistically.

Leonard lit a smoke and offered one to her, she declined. Leonard watched the smoke dance with the skyscrapers. "Sometimes you have make a change. It gets a little frustrating losing over and over again, so I found something I could win at. Haven't lost a trial yet, it pays well too. Sure beats being in a padded cell in that second rate mental institution you always threw me into. You should be happy, crime is down all over the city." Leonard spoke the truth, he blackmailed every client into going legitimate after their trial.

"I know you're hypnotizing the judge and jury, that's why you always win." Scarlet Shadow continued to press.

"Any proof of that?" Leonard asked smugly. He only used hypnosis on the reporters to get them to be quiet.

"No." Scarlet responded flatly.

"That's because I don't do that. It would contradict the point I'm trying to make."

Scarlet Shadow grasped Leonard around the neck and dangled him over the edge. Leonard kept smoking.

"That you "heroes" are anything but. You're jack booted thugs who believe they are above the law. Judge and Jury rolled into one. Newsflash Sam, we already have those. I've never seen you with a signed warrant in your hand. You used to just smash through the wall of my hideout, usually pummeling one of my associates. All the evidence you have ever gathered is useless. Almost every one of your nemeses walks the streets free now. Put me down please."

Scarlet Shadow lightly placed Leonard back on solid ground on her own accord. She was the one person that Leonard couldn't hypnotize, that's what made them enemies. She was the only one who could stop him and she was the best at it. "Very clever Leo, take away all the supervillains and make me obsolete."

"You always were a clever girl, your intelligence is very attractive. Courtroom is open to the public, I can always save you a front row seat if you want to watch me work. Maybe after your thuggery is no longer useful you could be my paralegal. We would make a good team. Speaking of which." Leonard reached into his wallet and handed Scarlet two hundred dollars.

She crushed the bills in her hand. "Trying to bribe me?"

Leonard shook his head. "Not at all. Buy some nice flowers for the White Shinobi's grave from me. I don't remember where you buried him. I'm sure you do."

The Scarlet Shadow's fist cocked back ready to knock Leonard's block off. He pulled out his cellphone. "Let me get this assault on camera."

Scarlet Shadow dropped her fist, she tucked the money into her boot and flew off into the sky. Her time as the "protector" of Star City quickly coming to an end.
