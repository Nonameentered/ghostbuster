Happy Hallow Home for the Criminally Insane defied expectations. Sunlight peeked through the iron barred windows of the modern hospital. Felt like walking into a nice hotel. Soft muzak played in the lobby. Patient's milled about the halls, the lights were on, but nobody was home. Happy Hallow employed world class pharmacists. Some call it a madhouse, Detective Falcona called it a safehouse. She adjusted her blue tie, really popped against her snow white suit, no coat or jacket today, summer was in full swing.

She flashed her badge at the receptionist, Falcona didn't recognize her. She must be new. Well built dame wearing powder blue scrubs that looked almost painted on. Bright blonde hair pulled back in a tight bun, hard to grab in a fight. Looked like this dame had been in a fight or too. Her crooked nose stood out on her round face. Falcona liked her already.

"Need to speak with Patient 18. He cognizant?" Falcona asked.

The receptionist buzzed the detective through. She pointed down the hallway, no ring on her finger. "I'll have him brought to visiting room six, down the hall to the left."

"Thanks doll, I'll catch ya on way back." Falcona reached her hand up to tip her hat out of habit. She felt silly.

Visiting room six had an unnerving calmness to it. Decorated to resemble a quaint french bistro. Felt off, felt too sterile. Falcona quickly scanned the room to find any hidden cameras or microphones. Every angle was covered. Good thing she updated Dr. Neutron's "patented" electro scrambler's firmware, shorted out the cameras for some privacy.

Falcona kicked her feet up and waited for her guest. An enormously muscular orderly brought him in. Orderly could double as Meteor Man, make more cash as a decoy body double. Falcona waved him out and waved Snowy Shinobi over.

His white hospital gown was too big for him, it hung loosely around his lean frame. Shin's normally stoic expression was gone, replaced by a look of emptiness, little fear mixed in. Falcona had never seen him like this, didn't know that was possible. Snowy Shinobi bowed and sat down.

Falcona lit a smoke and offered one to him, he declined. "How ya holdin up Shin? Making any friends?" She asked.

Shin didn't talk too much, he was more the strong silent type. Emphasis on the silent. Even wearing a bright white ninja outfit he could sneak up on anyone in the dark. Wrote the book on modern assassination. Valuable asset.

Shin's dark brown eyes narrowed, shooting arrows at Falcona with his gaze. "You have to get me out of this abominable asylum." He pleaded quietly and honorably. "This is not what we agreed on, you lied to me."

Smoke swirled from Falcona's lips, she winked at Shin. "We agreed that in exchange for you taking care of my little clone problem, I would let you have five minutes alone with the goon that got "too friendly" with your little sister. I told you that you would need to lay low after that. This is the safest place for you right now, you're a tough cookie Shin, you can handle this right? Only a couple more months than you can get back to playing dress-up."

"It's a madhouse here." Shin barked.

"Or so they say." Falcona sang.

"That's not funny Falco. Can you pull some strings and get me transferred somewhere else? Solitary in a supermax? Anywhere but here."

"No can do. We throw you in the real slammer, that becomes public record, everything about your exploits is sealed because you're here. I'm hiding you right under the noses of the schmucks that want your head on a platter. Dr. Dark Matter is real pissed at you. Those anti-positron clones from dimension z were key components of his operation. We snagged the doohickey he was usin to open dimensional rifts. We rattled a lot of cages with this one, drove a lot of rats out. Sorry I haven't visited more, been busy being the pied piper." Falcona smirked.

"None of that matters to me. Do you know how hard it is to walk the path of zen here?" Shinobi snatched the smoke from Falcona's lips and took a drag, caught Falcona off-guard. She he let him keep that one and lit another.

"Enlighten me. Better be good though."

"The patient across the hall from me screams night and day. Not a pained scream, not a sorrowful cry, they stand upon a soapbox vehemently preaching about the end of days. Hellfire will not rain from the sky they say, but rather an incoherent babbling portending great doom none of which makes any sense to me." Shin's voice trembled as he spoke.

"Huh, how do they think this crazy world is coming to an end?" Falcona inquired.

"Fictional characters shall become reality, inhabiting the same space we do. Now the ramblings are unclear and venture into strange tangents often, but one thing is constant. They truly believe that they will become the messiah for these fictional characters, mostly ponies and some odd abomination of pokemon and sonic the hedgehog.

Crudely drawn scenes of this apocalypse are painted with fecal matter, they show them off during the therapy circle. The stench is unbearable. The truly maddening thing, is that they might be the most sane person here besides myself."

"In the land of the blind the one eyed man is king." Falcona interjected.

"I would rather be a slave on my knees than be king of this wretched lot. Do you want to know why my hallmate is here?"

Falcona nodded.

"They got "too friendly" with their own mother. Claimed it healed her soul so that she would be strong enough to survive the end of days. Get me out of here Falco, I beg of you."

Falcona shut her eyes tight, her stomach turned, she rubbed her forehead. She looked into Shin's eyes, they pleaded for help, he looked broken. She whipped out her cellphone. "Give me a minute. Let me make a call."

Falcona rose from her bistro chair and strutted over to the barred window. A lone tree stood in the middle of the enclosed exercise yard. Finally the call went through.

"Hey Double S it's me, did I call at a bad time? Sorry to interrupt but this shouldn't take long. I'm good. I need a small favor from you. Can you babysit the other Double S for two months? Let him crash at your place, I know you two get along well.

No.....no......no I am not trying to set you up with him, he did me a favor, I need you to do him a favor, then I'll owe you a favor. Would mean a lot to me. Your're the best doll. Drinks are on me next time I see you. Okay talk later, get back to saving the day."

Falcona strode over to the door of the visiting room. "Come on Shin we're getting you out of here."

Shin sprinted to the door, he bowed deeply. Tears streamed down his face. "Thank you Falco! Thank you so much."

"Don't thank me kid thank Scarlet Shadow when you see her. You'll be safe and secure in her quiet safehouse. Now listen, and listen good. Continue to keep your head down and your nose clean. I catch one syllable that you suited up, I'm gonna toss you right back in here, maybe get you a roommate when I do. Clear?"

"Yes Ma'am."

"You always were a polite kid. Go get your stuff, I'll give you a ride over."

Falcona leaned up against her jet black vintage chevy muscle car, sunning her face and enjoying the warm breeze in her hair. Another super broken by seeing how dark the depths of Star City really are, and how easy it is to get lost in those catacombs.
