"So," the man in the frilly coat said with a wide smile, "did my summon perform adequately?"

The man in front of him jumped a little; he had no idea anyone had approached him. As soon as the shock wore off, he went right back to catching his breath. The battle was only just won, his armour still dripping with the blood of the vile monster.

"It... it is done," the man breathed out.

"Sure looks it," the summoner noted.

"Your... *friend*, as you call it," the man cautiously said, "it... I've never seen anything fight like that. Perhaps it has something to do with the number of arms it has."

The summoner looked at the creature he had called upon for the task. It resembled an automaton more than a living being, a creature the shape of a vase practically entirely covered in brass armour, razor-sharp sword in each of its 6 arms. He sometimes lovingly referred to it with the nickname 'Meat Grinder'. He gave the abomination a friendly wave and it disappeared into thin air.

"How do you keep that... *thing* on a leash? I was almost certain it would turn on me the second the job was one."

"What, Frithruna? She's not a thing, good sir," the summoner frowned. He picked up a piece of the dead monster, inspecting it closely with the bored eye of someone who was greatly unimpressed. "No, she's just a friend I'd helped a long time ago. Not... not from around here, you could say."

"How did you bind it, then?" the man asked. He finally caught his breath and stood up straight, now towering a good half meter above the summoner.

"Ah, funny story. See, this inventor, they needed help with-" he stopped suddenly and tapped his head. "Here I go blabbering again! Perhaps we could talk about it over, say, a nice cup of mead? Somewhere less... bloody?"

"And I suppose you'll be wanting your payment?" the man asked.

"See," the summoner rubbed his chin, "I must say, I'm quite impressed with your martial prowess. Not many could keep up with Frithruna like that. So, how about we keep this one on the house? A favour from a friend," he chuckled heartily.

The man frowned - he expected to pay a pouch full of gems. For the summoner to leave that money like that... it seemed off.

"I can see your confusion," the summoner noted. "Not to worry - I'm not taking your soul or anything. See, unlike other summoners, I don't drag anyone through rifts in space and force them to do anything. Everyone helps of their free will. You could call me more of a... facilitator. Someone who 'knows a guy'."

He tapped him on his back - or at least as high as he could.

"And now," he smiled even wider, "I know you."
