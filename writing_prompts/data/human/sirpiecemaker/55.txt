"I just... I still don't quite understand," Captain Jefferson repeated as he sat across from the colourfully dressed man. This was to be a day of triumph - not just for him, but all of humanity. The warp drive! Travel lightyears in seconds! And, of course, at last contact with other intelligent life!

And he did. He was found by an alien ship which promptly ushered him into a megastructure orbiting a nearby - relatively speaking, of course - star that served as a meeting centre for the Galactic Community. A centre where he saw more aliens than he could ever imagine. A centre where he found another human.

"It's not as bad as it sounds," the fellow human nodded. "I mean people don't really think about it, but when you get abducted, you don't just disappear. Most of us end up here."

"But... there's thousands of you! You've made an entire country just out of abductees!" Jefferson cried out.

"We have an excellent source of income from tourism. You'd be shocked how many aliens find human culture utterly fascinating," the man laughed. Jefferson was less entertained.

"Look," the man continued, "I can imagine this is tough. You expected to be the first human on the galactic scene. It's not your fault! We've been around for centuries, you couldn't have-"

"Did you say centuries?" Jefferson interrupted.

"Oh. *Right*. This has been going on for a *while*. That and there's some, uh... excellent healthcare on the galactic market. I'm actually 307," the man said casually. Jefferson eyed him up and down. He looked barely 40.

"This is insane," Jefferson continued. "Don't you miss Earth? Your families?"

"They're dead by now," the man said dryly. His tone was casual, but the way he lowered his eyes betrayed proved he wasn't as callous about it as he wanted to seem.

"And do you not hold a grudge against those who took you?"

"That's... a peculiar matter. See, abducting sentient species is strictly against Galactic Code. On Earth, it's mostly done by the sh'keen - I always pronounce it wrong, mind you - who are heavily scrutinised by the Lawbringers. That's, uh, sort of like Galactic police. Still, it does happen. Basically, those who abduct us aren't a part of the Community."

"Huh," Jefferson said half-heartedly.

"You alright?" the man said with a warm smile.

"Processing."

"Understandable."

The two sat silently as the man quietly sipped a beverage Jefferson had never seen but looked oddly appetizing.

"Did any of you ever try going back?" Jefferson asked.

"Some. Never ends well."

"How so?"

"Well," the man adjusted himself in his seat, "few of us - those abducted more recently, mind you - can attest that claiming to have been abducted by aliens don't fare too well. And some of those were likely those who chose to return," he said and motioned a circle around his temple.

"But you could show the technology you used to get back, surely! That-"

"Would be extremely against the Code. Lawbringers wouldn't let you get 10 light years from a non-space-faring civilization with current tech. You have to go in covertly with an official escort. Tons of paperwork."

"But we've been space-faring since, like... 1960's," Jefferson protested.

"Right, the Moon, right?" the man noted. "Yeah, one of the recent arrivals told me about that. Let's be honest though... that's like comparing driving on a highway to sticking a finger out of your window."

Jefferson opened his mouth to protest but found no words. The man was ultimately right, painful as it might have felt.

"Now what?" Jefferson asked. He felt silly for asking that - he was the first man to travel in the warp, he was supposed to be making those calls, but in the face of this colossal revelation, he felt totally helpless.

"Well, Earth has officially become advanced enough to be welcomed into the Community. Still - there's a lot of paperwork to be done and committees to be assembled before we can officially get to that. Best you stay a while until that is all done, meet the locals," the man smiled.

Jefferson nodded, though he wasn't wholly convinced by his own agreement. The man reached into his waistcoat and pulled out an old pocket watch with an engraved lid. Unlike the man himself, the watch actually seemed its age, though it was excellently maintained.

"Now then," the man stood up with a wide smile. "Lunch?"
