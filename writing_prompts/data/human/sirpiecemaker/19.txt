"The lad died of speaking too hard!" Thor bellowed, Mjollnir still pointed towards the young man standing before them. "I don't care what Loki says, he's **not** getting into Valhalla!"

"Brother, please, *you'll hurt my feelings*," Loki smirked with sarcasm so sharp it could double as one of his daggers. "You should know that not all battles are fought with muscles."

"I must agree with Lord Loki, Lord Thor," the young man pitched in. "The tongue is a weapon more powerful-"

"I'll show you power," Thor growled.

"Brother," Loki stepped in, "must you *really*\-"

"Enough! Both of you!" another voice boomed as the doors of the Great Hall of Valhalla swung open, revealing Odin, the All-Father in all his glory. "Blast, if I have to listen to you bicker any longer I'll go feed myself to Fenrir voluntarily."

The two sons exchanged rather nasty looks but stepped aside for their father.

"So," Odin said as he sized the young man up and down, "you're to enter Valhalla?"

"It is what I have been told, All-Father," the man said and bowed his head. Despite not being of any faith - certainly not of the Norse kind - he saw it fit to show proper respect to the gods he considered myths mere hours ago when he still drew breath.

"And you died in battle?" Odin asked.

"A debate."

Odin tilted his head curiously.

"You see," the man continued, "I was in a rather heated exchange of ideas in my debate class and, well, I suppose some vein in my brain just... gave out. One second I was presenting my argument, the other..." he said and waved his hand.

"A *battle of wits*, father! Certainly it is worthy-" Loki started but Odin shushed him with a mere motion of his hand.

Another man walked from the hall and Odin turned to him.

"Týr - what would your wisdom advise?"

"If he arrived here, the Norns dictated so. They do not make mistakes," Týr calmly stated.

"Hel take me if they don't!" Thor protested. "They have an agenda and you know it, the lot of you - you most of all, Father! I won't let *them* dictate who's worthy!"

"I must say," the young man suddenly said, "I share Lord Thor's sentiment. I am not of your faith and yet here I stand - could I truly be worthy? Is it fate or is it a *trial*, perhaps? Maybe this is not about me - perhaps the Norns themselves are testing you, toying with you."

The assorted gods gave the man various looks.

"*Now* he speaks some sense!" Thor nodded.

"Young man," Odin said, "do you not wish to enter Valhalla? Why would you agree with Thor, who wishes to deny you entry?"

"Valhalla, Heaven, Hell, Tartarus... who cares?" the man smiled widely. "I'm just a human. I doubt I can decide where I go, but this? *This*?!" he said and excitedly pointed towards the gods, "I get to not just watch but *participate* in a debate of gods! The greatest debate I could *ever* be a part of! No matter where I go after this, the memory of this exchange of ideas will forever remain with me. It's its own reward."

Odin turned back to Týr who gave him a subtle, sly smile.

"So you care not for the outcome of this... *battle of wits*, only for the battle itself?"

"Of course!" the man nodded happily. "I have no preconceived goal in sight - one must be willing to change their stance if a debate is to be had; if you sternly refuse to change your standpoint, you are not debating - you are arguing, desperately clinging to your original idea. There's no fun in that. No matter the outcome, I wish to enjoy it. Win or lose, it is still... *glorious*! "

Loki smiled widely, clearly pleased. Týr nodded contently. Even Thor's frown softened somewhat. Odin stepped towards the man and patted him on the shoulder.

"I believe you'll fit right in, lad," he smiled.
