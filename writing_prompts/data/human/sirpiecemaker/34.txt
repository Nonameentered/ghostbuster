It's empty.

All of it. No matter how many stars we observed, how many planets we searched, how much we dug into the dirt, there's *no one* out there. We've... seen things one could not imagine. Oceans of liquid diamonds, planets teetering on the edge of a supermassive black hole, frozen in time, the death throes of a neutron star destroying entire star systems. But we never found any life out there. Not once. We're all truly alone out here.

Well, for now.

We didn't search the cosmos by using wooden paddles to wade through the void. No, we're long past that. We've mastered the laws of physics a long time ago, bent them to our will. Once, we thought faster-than-light travel was impossible. Now, we find it impossible to think we assumed that, once.

Us being alone in the universe is no longer a fact. It is a choice. And we choose not to.

Finding a suitable planet will be easy enough; exoplanets are more common than we thought. We'll seed life of all kinds, ensuring biodiversity. We'll start the gravitational fields and compress time to our liking, allowing millennia to happen on the planet while mere years do for us.

Eventually, a species will dominate the planet and we will observe. We will nurture them and nudge them in the right directions. Subtly, from the shadows. It must ultimately be their will, their choice. We'll... make sure they don't do the same mistakes as we did. Wars, famines, plagues... a species marred by greed, bloodlust and hatred. Our history is broken beyond repair, haunted by the untold lives we have wronged. Like all good parents, we want them to be good. Better than us. They *must* be.

And if they're not?

We'll do what we as a species do best. And when it is done, we'll try again.

Our history is already soaked in the blood of billions. What's a little more?
