"*All of you?*" the newly initiated vampire hunter hissed as he looked around at his fellow slayers.

"We didn't ask to be vampires," the... *vampire* vampire hunter before him said. "*None* of us. It is a curse, a blight upon our hearts."

"But why do you hunt your own kind?" the human continued, hand on the hilt of his sword.

"They're *not* our kind, Rhodri," the vampire protested. "No more than the worst human criminals are your kind. And... we think that we can kill the Elder - the progenitor of vampirekind - that our curse might be broken. That we might turn... normal again." He looked down at his pale hands with palpable disgust, the black veins visible through his skin a constant reminder of his bleak situation.

"We just want to return to our lives. Our families," the vampire said gently.

"You're still vampires. You drink human blood. "

"Only as much as we need! Only from the willing, for money! And we never, *ever*, kill!" the vampire yelled.

The human relaxed his posture, finally releasing his sword. "Good," he said. "The Elder vampire is... he must be stopped. And if you're with me, that is more than enough for me."

"Why do *you* hunt him? We all share a reason, but you, a human, unspoiled by the blight - why do you?" the vampire tilted his head. The human looked down.

"My sister. Glynis. He... he bit my sister."

"I'm sorry."

The human extended his hand towards the vampire. The two nodded slightly as they shook hands.

"Good hunting," Rhodri said. "And when this is done, when he is dead, burned, his ashes scattered to the wind... if you're still vampires..."

The vampire looked up at the human.

"I won't hesitate for a *second* to drive a stake through every single one of you, drop you where you stand," Rhodri smiled. "Same way I did Glynis. Because *you are monsters*."
