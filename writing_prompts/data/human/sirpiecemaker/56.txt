Cybernetics... scared me. And could you blame me? Imagine a piece of metal, something utterly alien to you, not only being shoved into your body but completely replacing one of its functions. As someone who went through several defective coffee machines, the idea petrified me.

Then I lost my eye.

A stupid accident and now I was short one dimension and my job was on the line. Employer was beyond convinced that I can't do my job with only one eye so I was given an ultimatum - get a cybernetic one or get out. I... I couldn't find another job. Not in this city. So I accepted.

It was the best decision of my life.

I could see! Not just 'see' like I could before, I could *truly* see all I wanted! Spectrums of light, details on a minuscule level, sharpness you couldn't imagine. The eye was... it was *so much* more than the organic one. I had to get the other one replaced too - I couldn't enjoy such divinity in only half my sight. And I didn't regret it a single iota.

But... I looked down at my hands, wrinkled and weak, riddled with carpal tunnel, and wondered; could the same level of improvement be made? I was hesitant, I'll admit, but seeing the reviews on-line, the offers from ripper clinics, I... had to try. And it changed my life just as much as the eyes did. I've never experienced such dexterity, such ease of movement, such grip strength! The blueprints I can draw now are nothing short of mechanically precise. The other hand naturally had to go.

I looked into new cyberware more and more. My boss said I was perhaps taking it too far - how ironic given he pushed me to take the first step, something I am infinitely grateful for. Even my friends said, if jokingly, that I was becoming more machine than man, but how short-sighted is that?! Are men now permitted to perfection machinery can provide? What does it truly mean to be a man anyway? Is this not, dare I say, the next step in our evolution?

I'm lucky to have found others who share this vision of bodily perfection. Some call them radicals and extremists, but what can you expect from the mainstream media-consuming masses who are yet to experience what we do, to understand what we stand for? 

We will become perfect. It is our destiny. When we shed the weakness of our flesh, we will be whole.

I lost an eye, back then.

I gained transcendence.
