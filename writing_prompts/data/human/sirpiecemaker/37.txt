"I just... like, look, I know *what* you're saying, I understand the *words*, but I still just..."

"That's alright," I smiled. "Perhaps I can demonstrate it better?" They looked at me with expectation then meekly nodded.

"So, uhh..." I mumbled and looked around before finally setting my eyes on a bowl of apples. I took one in my hand.

"I've got an apple, right?" I started gently. They nodded.

"One apple, right?"

"Right," they said.

I reached over to the bowl again and picked up another.

"Now I've got two, right?"

"Yep," they nodded.

"Now, what would happen if I put them together and combined all theoretical apples into one?"

"You'd still get... two ap- THE FUCK?" they yelled as I put my hands together and the two apples combined, flowing into one another and creating a red pulsating mass in the shape of an apple that constantly flowed inwards and outwards, representing the infinite apples between the first and the second. The infinite stem on top of the apple twitched slightly.

"There! Infinite apples!"

"My- holy shit my eyes hurt looking at that! What the fuc-"

"Hey now, language," I frowned. I reached over for a third apple and added it to the apple singularity.

"Now we have three apples, still the same infinite apple. Does that help?" They stared at me blankly.

"How in the FUCK ARE YOU EVEN DOING THAT? I MEAN-"

"Hmm..." I interrupted. "I suppose I should have... not created a singularity to demonstrate. Let's start over," I said and split the singularity back into 4 apples.

"Wait, now there's 4, we started with 3!" they cried out.

"Oh! Right! Sorry," I laughed and pushed the fourth apple into the third.

"Ok, so-"

"Are we just gonna ignore the fact you just did some wizard-tier shit?" they asked.

"Better to ignore it, yeah."

"...alright."

"Ok, I think I know what the issue here is," I smiled again.

"That is?"

"You say the infinity between one and zero is smaller than infinity between one and two, right? Like 10 is smaller than 20?"

"Exactly! So why isn't it?"

"Simple. **Infinity is not a number**. Normal rules don't apply to it. There *is no* greater or lesser, no divison of multiplication, no plus or minus. Infinity is infinity, no matter where it is. It just *is*."

"I mean..." they slowly said, "I suppose...?"

"Excellent!" I clapped my hands happily. "Now onto quantum entanglement."

"Oh FUCK NO!" they yelled.
