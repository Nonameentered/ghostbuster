"Hey."

"Hey."

"Whatcha got there?"

"An M1 Abrams. Wished for it."

"No, no, not that. *That*!"

"Oh. A sandwich."

"Really? What kind?"

"Rye bread, shallots, chicken, butter, chives, mayo, hint of chilli."

"Where the hell do you get a sandwich like that?"

"Found this here Clown's Nose. Kinda like a Monkey's Paw, I reckon."

"And you wished for a *sandwich*?"

"And the tank."

"Right, sure, but the sandwich?"

"Was hungry."

"So what's the drawback? There's always a drawback."

"Well, I don't think it will kill me being a clown nose and all. I think it will try to twist my wish in a humorous way. The tank only fires a white flag with the word 'Bang' on it."

"Huh. And the sandwich?"

"Think the chicken was a bit old. Tastes... funny."
