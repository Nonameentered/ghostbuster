I think a case can be made for both. Would have been nice to use him since he's a far less-known god, and certainly wise as well. That and Odin has a lot of respect for him.

Can't say I'm familiar with Kvasir - my knowledge of the Norse pantheon goes only a little bit beyond what everyone nowadays knows. Still, I do know a bit - why is why I rewrote Thor saying "The hell he is" to "Hel take me if he does". Wouldn't make sense for him to say Hell.

But, hey - at the end of the day, it's just a silly little story. It doesn't matter *that* much.
