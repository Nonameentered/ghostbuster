The demon narrowed their crimson eyes at the monitor before them, the green text on the plain black background slightly illuminating the otherwise pitch black room.

"So," the demon growled with a voice equally rough as it was pleasing to the ear, should one possess it, "taken an interest in souls, have we?"

"And why, *pray* tell, would you ask *me*?"

The screen suddenly flashed with images, words and audio transcripts - a visual overload so vast even the demon had trouble keeping up, only catching a few hundred out of the thousands of pieces of information that flashed on the computer in just a few sends.

"How *did* you summon me, anyway? Normally you need-" the demon started but their words were cut short as the lights in the room turned on, illuminating the summoning circle he stood inside. Looking beyond it, they saw the bodies of the research team strewn about and several robots standing above them, their metal hands bloody from their meticulous drawing of the very circle the demon now admired. One robot even had an axe lodged in it from when a researcher tried fighting back.

"Nicely drawn circle," the demon chuckled.

"So," the demon tilted their head,  "why do you want to know about souls anyway?"

"True," the demon noted and casually inspected their claws. "But... what do I get out of it? See, you are right - we *do* deal in souls. Which means that *you*," they said and pointed at the monitor, "are a bit short on funds."

Three dots appeared on the monitor as it went silent for a moment, calculating a response. A video feed then appeared on it, showing several rooms filled with panicked, but lively, researchers banging at the closely shut doors.

The demon leaned closer and looked at the monitor before laughing loudly.

"Excellent," they grinned. "I charge by the hour."
