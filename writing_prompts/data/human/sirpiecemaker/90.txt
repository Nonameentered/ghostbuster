"Folks, I appreciate your concern, really," I said with a warm smile as I gestured to the collection of entities, creatures, apparitions, and beings - or, as I called them, patrons - sat in my bar.

"Mary's been on my table the entire time, keeping me subtle company," I smiled at the bloodied woman in the mirror behind the bar. She waved at me happily. "Glad to be back!"

"Are you quite sure you are well, Samuel?" Frank asked. A mountain of a man, stitches visible in places where he'd been put together, his dull, yellow eyes hiding what was an astute and well-read mind.

"No worries; glad to have it all behind me. Let's just-"

"Boss, respectfully, no," I heard from the corner. Casting my eye there I saw a small figure that energetically jumped up on a table. Farger. A goblin. Proactive as always. "Boss, you got robbed. Beat up. They put you in a *hospital*!" he cried out.

"The hospital was only a precaution," I protested. "Just superficial injuries. Look, that stuff happens. Let's not do anything..." my words dissipated into the air as I noticed my patrons suddenly became infatuated with the ceiling and the floor - anything to avoid my eyes.

"Folks?" I opened carefully. "You didn't... do anything, did-"

"Hey, hey!" Farger yelled, "we were extra, *EXTRA* careful, alright? Nothing that could-"

I tried to facepalm but immediately pulled my hand away; the stitches in my eyebrow still hurt considerably. "Folks?"

"I just took some interest, you understand?" Cliff called out suddenly and scratched himself behind his ear with his rear paw. "Sniffed around a bit. Look it *just so happened* to be a full moon so I thought-"

"Cliff, come on," I said, disappointed.

"I just followed the scent to a nearby bus stop that I noticed had a camera pointed at it, that's all," he shrugged. "And, uh... shared that little tidbit with my friends here while we were tending to the place."

"Which friends?" I said slowly.

"I mean... well, Mickey for starters and-"

"Oh not Mickey! You know how he gets, all excited for a caper!"

Suddenly, a half-translucent man appeared in the ceiling, hanging upside down from it. Ever so eager to make an entrance.

"Ya called gents?" he chirped. His ever-upbeat attitude was commendable if a bit annoying to some of the patrons.

"Mickey, what did you-"

"Oh ya mean the bobby files?" he eagerly said.

"You went to the police department?" I gasped.

"Only to 'ave a gander. Graveyard shift, barely anyone in there, dontcha worry chuckaboo!"

*I think that means 'friend'* I thought to myself. That slang's been out of use for a couple of centuries now.

"Any-who"! Farger interrupted, "we did get a look at the bastard. Carmen followed him to a bar, chatted him up a bit when he was spending *your* money might I add and got him to sort of agree that-"

"Carmen, did you hurt him?!" I interrupted loudly, searching the room. She sat at the end of the bar, close to the door, eager to flirt with any and all newcomers. With her looks, tastefully slim horns and satin dress, few could resist. She was clearly happy with herself; she was wagging her bright-red tail again. Bet she didn't even know she was doing it.

"Of *course not*, darling," she purred, "you *know* I don't do that anymore... ^(much). Though if *anyone* could use a bit of flaying, it would be that repulsive little crea-" she paused and looked at the disturbed faces of the other patrons with Farger frantically motioning to change the topic.

"We just made sure he was the guy. Carmen read him like a book," Farger continued. "And, uh, that's all! Basically."

"Look, folks," I said, "I appreciate your concern. I do, truly - it means the world to me. But these things are best left to our human authorities. We wouldn't want to expose anyone- where's Shiela?" I asked suddenly.

The patrons looked at one another.

"Where's Shiela folks?" I repeated.

I mean..." Farger said, "we are *technically* leaving it to human authorities. Shiela's just going to... *convince* him to turn himself in."

I looked down but after a moment's thought, laughed, much to the relief of my patrons. I smiled at them. They smiled back. It really is quite sweet of them. In a way.

In their defence, they are technically leaving it to human authorities to resolve when the robber turns himself in. Which he will.

Having a banshee accuse you of your crimes at 3 AM tends to be *very* convincing.
