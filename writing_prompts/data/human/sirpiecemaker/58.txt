"I'm... tired. Not physically, not even mentally. Does that make any sense? You know what I mean?"

"..."

"Yeah. Guess you don't. It's just... I think I've seen too much. Done too much. I'm empty, too empty to be tired *normally*. I think it's all catching up to me."

"..."

"Truth be told, I didn't think it'd end like this. Ignoble as far as ends go. A lifetime of combat excellence and what do I get? Abandoned, thrown away. Left to die."

"..."

"Stop giving me that look."

"..."

"I know. I'm sorry. I didn't- I didn't mean it like that."

"..."

"At least you got lucky. Died in your sleep, more or less. Me? I hear them coming, the steady rumble of their steps getting closer. I won't win. It won't be pretty. But I can't just give up. Hey, maybe I'll take a few with me."

"..."

"Yeah. Agree. I think... I think it's time for me to finally rest soon, one way or the other. I *will* rest. Even if I have no time for sleep."
