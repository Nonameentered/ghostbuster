I see! That's frankly a theme in my stories, one I get commented on quite often. I suppose I just take the "short story" rather literally. with the few longer stories being an exception where I had a *longer story to tell*. I've always felt, in all media, that it's good to leave off on a strong point than to drag it out beyond your own skill and imagination. Not to mention that my writing style is rather concise overall - I do not have the patience or skill for verbose descriptions.

Plus, leaves you with an active and engaged imagination!

Not to say it's not a far criticism/feedback - just my 2 cents.

*Oh and just as a small teaser, The Door stars a character by the name of Brigitte LaCroix, someone I've created years ago, have grown greatly attached to and actually thought about making a book about. Still do.*
