"Oh, here comes the sanctimony squad!" the man in the purple suit cried out as the Protectors arrived. It's not like he hadn't expected them; an extinction-level threat like this meteor did warrant the presence of all the heroes, but he still couldn't help but feel disgust.

"Villain!" the hero in the front yelled towards the gaggle of ill-meaning individuals as he landed, "Stand aside, scoundrels! You are fortunate the meteor requires our undivided attention! Should you attempt to stop us, let it be known-"

"Stop you?" the villain yelled back, "We're here to stop it, you moron! Last time I checked, we live on this planet too!"

The hero was taken aback as his bravado left him. "You *what*?"

"Oh, what, did you think that we'd sit by with a drink in our hands while the planet burned? Then what? Any idea how boring it would be?" the villain said.

"But... you've threatened to destroy the world yourself!" the hero protested and pulled out a small notebook, listing through it. "...on at least 5 different occasions!"

"Do you not understand the concept of showmanship?" the villain grinned. "You have *no* sense setting the stage for a proper drama. Say my demands weren't met and I did blow up the world. What would I do then, exactly?"

"Then why did you threaten it at all?" the hero asked, confused.

"Thrill of the perfect performance," the villain said, a glint in his eye.

"Hey, uh, lads?" another villain - a silver-haired woman in the back - called out, "Getting rather distracted here I reckon. World-ending threat and all, you catch?"

The leading hero and chief villain stared at each other in a moment of utmost tension. Both the heroes and the villains subtly prepared themselves for a fight, should the need arise. Neither wanted it. The pressure was palpable in the air-

"Narrator, man, could you cut it out?" the hero yelled towards one of his colleagues, "Seriously, not helping!"

Sorry.

"This doesn't change anything," the hero said. "You're still the villains. You're still wanted. You're-"

"Spare me," the villain scoffed. "I'll need Megamer to help me out with moving some equipment," he said and pointed towards a hero in the back, a woman of pure muscle.

"You dare think this uneasy ceasefire will allow you to command my allies?!"

"I have a plan, Ultra. I have gear ready. I know what I need to do. What do *you* have?" the villain said and looked the hero straight in his eyes. Despite being a good deal shorter, his confidence more than made up for it.

The hero relaxed his fist and conceded, nodding towards Megamer who set out towards the villain.

"Oh, and," the villain said, turning around, "Narrator- I could use some feedback on some blueprints, finishing touches and all. Do you mind?"

Not at all, said the Narrator and stepped forward- ok this is getting a little trippy.
