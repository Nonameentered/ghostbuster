Thank you!

Not sure I could pick one - I like jumping from setting to setting to make the story more interesting; a noire fantasy, a sci-fi romance, it's fun to play around. Heck, I've even written a sci-fi fantasy story.

So, yeah. Probably couldn't pick just one give- it's Warhammer 40K.

Probably.

It's both so detailed and deep as well as completely over-the-top ridiculous that it's always a blast to write for.
