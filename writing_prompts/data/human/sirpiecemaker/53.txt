Of all the joints in town, he had to walk into mine.

It was a cold autumn evening, the rain outside pouring for what seemed like forever now. The dim, orange light of the rusted street lights shone into the doorway of my dusty old bar, reminding you of your age, the fact you're not the man you used to be. A lifetime of cigarettes, cheap bourbon and failed romanced will do that to you.

I'd have barely noticed his presence had the ancient wooden boards not creaked the moment he set foot inside. I cast my glance at him; a weary eye of an old detective was rusty, but astute enough to know who he was. It was him.

I was warned to stay away from him. I knew the stories from my time in the precinct; the sort the old guard tells the greenhorns to scare them straight. Except there always was a nugget of truth to them, this one especially. I knew I should run the moment I saw him, but... there was something about him, something I didn't expect to see. I was entranced. I couldn't turn away, not now.

I put down the glass I had been unsuccessfully polishing and walked towards him, cautious of every step, aware of every noise. He stared at me the entire time, prepared to attack should I move a muscle the wrong way. There was this uneasy tension in the air; both of us measured the other.

Finally, I arrived within arm's length.

I bent over.

"You lost?" I said in a gruff voice; the only voice I had left.

He chortled, like so many Pitbulls do.

Carefully, I extended my hand - it was a risk, the exact sort of risk that got me kicked off of the force, the recklessness I could never shake. I knew petting him could end up in blood, but with my hand scarred as it was from a history of back alley fights, a few extra wouldn't hurt.

He sniffed it carefully and licked it. The tongue was warm but betrayed friendship he'd longed for. Almost without hesitation, he laid down and exposed his gruff belly. I petted him contently. 

No collar; no owner - my gut told me as much. Until now, that is. *So this is how you get a dog*, I thought. A mutt off the street for a mutt from the force. Fitting.

"Who's a good boy?" I grinned. "Yes, you are!"
