One that I think about fairly often - [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/rzxvyh/wp_a_bloodied_up_child_knocks_on_your_door_in_the/).

It's not that it's *especially* unique, but I loved seeing how many completely different stories it spawned. It had classic monster ones, subversive monster ones, secret society, evil superpowers, the variety was fantastic and I still remember them even after all this time.

It was also *very* early in my writing here, making it stick out in my mind a tad more.
