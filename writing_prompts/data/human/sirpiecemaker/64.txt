"Aaand... there's... done!" the dwarf yelled and, with a final strike with his pinky-sized chisel, the stone broke, shattering into 4 even pieces. Rumbling filled the cave as the boulder crashed onto the floor, followed by a metallic clang of the sword bouncing lightly.

The human stared at him, awestruck.

"I- I just-" the human stammered, unable to find the words.

"Och, is nothing laddie. Really though, ye all tried pulling this poker out of a stone? Why'dae think that's possible? Just mine it is what I say," the dwarf said and wiped his bushy brow.

"Now then!" the dwarf said and clasped his hands together, "I believe it's time to collect!"

Rubbing his hands for warmth, the dwarf bent over, reaching for the sword but stopped when he realized the human was not only staring daggers at him, but in fact holding a dagger at him.

"I'm sorry, master dwarf, but that wasn't the deal," he said slowly.

"Ye hired me to break this 'ere boulder, lad. I did," the dwarf grumbled.

"Yes. But we never agreed that you'd be *collecting* this treasure," the human said and pointed down. "You've got your fee as we agreed."

"Commission?" the dwarf scoffed. "Laddie, the commission is gravel compared to this 'ere treasure. Had I known..." he said, tightening the grip on his pickaxe.

"Master dwarf, I urge you, let this one go. This sword is my *rightful* heritage and-"

"Sword?" the dwarf said. "Whaddya mean sword, laddie? This boulder - pure thaumic granite. My folks in Iron Mountains will-"

"Wait, what?" the human replied, lowering his daggers. "You- I'm after the sword. What do you-"

"You mean this toothpick? Whatd' I care about it? Fine sword, aye, good craftsmanship, nice engraving in some... leaf-lover language looks, but the stone..."

The two stared at each other quietly, the dwarf curiously inspecting the sword while the human cautiously looked at the rocks.

"So... if I let you take the rocks..." the human said, "you don't mind if I take the sword?"

"Why would you- ya know what? Human matters. Dinnae care. Take the poker," the dwarf said and waved his hand before starting to collect the rocks in his cart. The two then shook hands, carefully - in case the other changed their mind - and went their separate ways.

*What a dumb dwarf*, the human thought. *To leave behind the Sword of the King, bearing the crown to a kingdom? Unthinkable.*

*What a dumb human,* the dwarf thought. *To leave behind Pure thaumic granite, worth all of the Iron Mountain? Unthinkable.*
