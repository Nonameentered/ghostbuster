Let the story flow, for sure. I look at a prompt and go "I can work with this, there is a story here."

If I don't, there's a good chance I won't write anything at all, even if I like the prompt; don't want to force it. So it's definitely a spur-of-the-moment inspiration thing.

Hope you have fun writing here!
