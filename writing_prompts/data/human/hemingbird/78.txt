The bearded professor walked back into the conference room along with Whitmer, wearing a somber expression. It was obvious to the rest of the audience that Whitmer had succeeded in convincing him. With that their last shred of doubt had been eliminated, which meant that they were prepared to hear the rest.

"What did he say?" a woman asked the professor. He made no reply. Tears trickled down his cheek but he didn't bother to wipe them off.

While they had been gone, Amber and Grok each told their stories. Grok hadn't quite mastered human language, but he was able to communicate via carefully-chosen words. However, they hadn't told them everything. Not yet.

Once again, Jonah Whitmer walked up on stage and tapped the microphone. "Thank you, Amber and Grok, for keeping the microphone warm for me. I will now explain why I couldn't share the details on how I brought my wife back to life."

Amber fidgeted with her arms. A flash of trepidation appeared in her eyes.

"After her accident, most of her was incinerated. Almost all traces of DNA burnt. Destroyed. But at our home I found fingernail clippings and hair. And from the junk DNA contained in their cells I was able to regenerate her. It was the most important discovery in human history. But while studying her genome, I learned a disturbing truth: Amber was not a human."

Some of those in the audience had wanted to share news of the conference online, but there was no signal available. Now they understood why. Whitmer had made sure they wouldn't spill this incredible secret that he had kept under lock and key for so long.

"But she doesn't look like a Neanderthal," objected the woman in the ponytail. "She is clearly human."

Whitmer laughed. "She is not a Neanderthal. And she is not a human. She is not even an earthling."

The chatter got intense for a moment. Not only had he resurrected his wife and a Neanderthal, but he had discovered evidence of extraterrestrial life? If true, it really was the greatest scientific breakthrough in the history of mankind.

"If I brought my wife back, only for her to be kidnapped and studied by secret military organization, what would be the point? So I decided that I couldn't show anyone the evidence of her alien origin."

"But ... Why are you telling us all now? You can't expect us to keep this a secret?"

As soon as the audience member said this, the mood shifted in the room. It occurred to them that they were all potentially in great danger. The bearded professor, however, laughed.

"You don't get it?" he asked. "Life and death has already lost all its meaning. Aliens? Neanderthals? It doesn't matter. Tell them, Whitmer. Tell them what they are."

All heads turned towards Whitmer and a for moment he just stared at them in silence. "Soon. But first I want everyone to take a good look at Amber and Grok."

It now occurred to the scientists that Grok kept his distance from Amber and that he watched her with caution. He seemed to be afraid of her.

"While teaching Grok English, I showed him a bunch of images and demonstrated the names of various objects. He's a quick learner. Syntax proved too much of a challenge, but he could form intelligible words and produce morphemes. One day, I showed him a picture of a stereotypical alien. It was just a random image. At least that was what I thought. Grok shrieked and tore it apart. Then he repeated three words: It. Kill. Friends. He said it over and over."

Grok's eyes went wide, as if reliving the horror.

"After discussing the matter with him, it became apparent that a species of extraterrestrials--Greys--roamed the planet a hundred thousand years ago. I believed him, but there was a problem: where had they all gone?"

Right on cue, Amber stepped forward.

A sense of panic overtook the conference room. Some of the audience members had tried to leave, but the doors were now all locked.

"Don't worry. I'm not a Grey. I'm a scientist. On the behalf of my species, I have been studying humanity for a long, long time. I did lose my life in the accident, and Jonah did bring me back. It's all true. The Greys wiped out the Neanderthals, and they almost erased humanity as well. That was when we decided that we had to intervene. We destroyed them all and we kept observing you. Now the time has come to make our existence known."

Cries of outrage erupted from the audience. They oscillated between total conviction and complete disbelief. Everything they knew and took for granted had been upturned. How could they ever recover from this?

"Fortunately, your reaction is much better than the first time," said Whitmer.

"First time?" a man said.

Whitmer shrugged. "You're soon going to have to learn how to deal with the existential consequences of teleportation technology. Think of this as a test."

He held out a hand towards the bearded professor. "If you won't mind leading the way, let's show them the truth."

As the doors were unlocked and the audience streamed out the doors, Grok breathed a deep sigh. He had been brought back to life in a strange world, and it seemed it was about to get even stranger.

Jonah grabbed hold of Amber's hand and smiled. Her eyes glittered.

From a distance they could the confused screams and cries, but they ignored it all.

There would soon be an echo of that sound spreading across the globe. Humanity would finally learn the truth. And Amber's compatriots would be able to make their presence known.

How would they respond? Hopefully they would be able to deal with the changes. And if not ...

Whitmer looked over at Grok. "You are certain that you know the location of the mass graves? We need more of your kind around. Just in case."

With a hesitant nod, Grok confirmed it.

"Good," said Whitmer. "In order to accomplish our goals, we might have to go back in time and start afresh."
