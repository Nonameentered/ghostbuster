I am a highly-skilled wizard in one of the most elite guilds of the realm: Moth Emperor.

Dhortazaar - A fire mage in our guild with a hot temper.

Arthur - Whiny kid who keeps failing upwards. Member of our rivals, Happy Lobster.

Marah - Arthur's little sister.

So me and Dhortazaar were hanging out after just having finished a dungeon. We cleared out the whole thing. You know what it's like. Plowing through the low-level defenders before reaching the lair where there's a treasure guarded by the boss. Basic stuff.

This was a dungeon with insect-like monsters. Spiders, basically. I don't like them myself but Dhortazaar thinks it's hilarious to roast them and watch their little legs curl up. I have to admit, it's a blast. A fire blast!

We were walking out of the dungeon, happy and exhausted, when Arthur and Marah walked up, making a big fuss over nothing.

There's a system in place for assigning available dungeons to guilds and in this particular case a fair mix of nepotism and corruption had resulted in the dungeon being handed over to Happy Lobster even though it was ours by rights. We were not happy. Our guild leader, Kharanz Ogren, said we should just suck it up. "It's just a third-rate dungeon anyways. No big loss."

Personally, I have a deep-seated sense of justice. I've just always been a decent guy, I guess. So this didn't sit right with me and I knew I had to do something about it. And when Dhortazaar flashed me a knowing grin, the case was already settled: this was our dungeon, and we were going to claim it.

It took hours. Blood and sweat and tears, right? We paid our price for it. Well, not the commission fee. Happy Lobster paid that one. And a fat bribe in addition, probably. The important thing is that we did the work fair and square and the damn dungeon was supposed to be ours anyhow!

Arthur starts screaming like a chipmunk with the runs about how he was going to do the dungeon with his little sister because it was the anniversary of their mother's death or something. Honestly, I didn't listen all that carefully.

The little shit wanted to fight us over it. Fight us! We had busted our asses scorching spiders left and right and this little runt wanted to steal our treasure? Too far, man. Too far.

Here's where this story comes into AITA territory. You see, I didn't know that his sister had a disability. I thought she was just being quirky or maybe just sort of dense like her brother. But no, Arthur had paperwork and everything. Only found out about that later though.

So in this dungeon we found a treasure spell. The boss had a whole bunch of legs and every time we cut one off, it grew a new one. When we finally defeated it, we got the Legs-a-Plenty spell. It does what it says on the tin, pretty much: you can use it to grow extra legs. Now I thought it would be funny to use it on this guy's sister.

"You don't have a leg to stand on!" I cried. "Oh wait. You *do*."

I thought with the name 'Happy Lobster' it would be funny to give her legs like a lobster. And honestly, it was hilarious. She cried and scurried around while Arthur shouted in a panic. "Marah! Stay still! I'll fix this! Don't be afraid! I'll fix it!"

Spoiler alert: he couldn't fix it.

But, uh, we couldn't either. Turns out, there was no reverse button on the thing.

I offered to cut them off. The extra legs, I mean. I thought it was a decent offer. Didn't want to have her spasming around like a lobster and all. But no. Arthur wouldn't have it. He started calling us names, saying we were monsters.

And that's when we realized that something was off with Marah. "Uh oh," said Dhortazaar. "Looks like she's [REDACTED]."

Let me tell you, Arthur *snapped*. "How dare you call my sister by that name! I will report you to the authorities!"

All the while, his sister kept running around in circles. I know it's bad but I couldn't help laughing. Dhortazaar couldn't either, though he tried.

We left them to fend for themselves, thinking everything would work out in the end. I mean, you'd think someone would be able to find a way to reverse the spell, right?

When we got back to Moth Emperor we told the story, expecting big laughs, but the office just fell into silence. "That's awful," said Kharanz. "You used a spell like that on a [REDACTED]?"

Now we've got a letter from magistrate and it looks like Arthur and Happy Lobster is trying to stir things up. I sent one back saying that Marah could maybe be their new mascot or something. I haven't heard back.

AITA for turning Arthur's disabled sister into a lobster girl?
