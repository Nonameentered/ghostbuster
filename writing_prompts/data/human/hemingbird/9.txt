"Oh, he kept saying things like dragon-shit, dragon-jerk and oh um, well, *dragon-bastard*."

"Lies! Slander! You damn dragon*-fu*—"

"Quiet in the court!"

Old man Balsafar banged his bone gavel til it nearly broke and his face had gone whiter than his instrument of justice for it had been already a long and weary session. Sam Breakheart brought a dragon to trial and they'd had to refit the room so that the scaly beast would be able to give testimony, it'd cost a fortune, and now chaos and disruption reigned.

"Sire Breakheart of Stone Co—" said the judge before pausing. Breakheart hailed from a village with an obscene name and he did not wish to disgrace himself by uttering it. "Sire Breakheart. Hold your silence as Philiem Carnage speaks his truth of the events as he knows them."

"... Knows bugger all," Sam muttered.

"As I was saying," the great dragon Carnage continued, "I was only minding my business working out riddles in my head. Oh, perhaps the court wishes to hear one?"

Judge Balsafar sighed. "I don't think that will be—"

"I carry a greater load dead than alive. While I lie, serving many men; if I were to stand, I should serve a few. If my entrails are torn out to lie open out of doors, I bring life to all, and I give sustenance to many. A lifeless creature which bites nothing, when loaded down I run on my way yet never show my feet. What am I?"

It was a shameless attempt at gaining the favor of the jury. Who could resist the allure of a dragon's riddle?

"A shoe!" Sam Breakheart cried out. "No! A sock. Gloves. Wait, no. Don't tell me. It's the wind!"

Philiem Carnage snorted with laughter. At the sound of the tittering of the beast, Sam's cheeks turned read.

"You ... You dragon-scoundrel!"

Balfasar banged his gavel with a fury. "Sire Breakheart of Stone Coc—Oh you! Quiet! Quiet in the court!"

"I do apologize on the behalf of my client," said the slick-haired attorney Sam had dragged along, clearly unwilling. "Men of humble origin have a particular fondness for riddles, as you well know, and those of a dragon? A riddle is the poet's udders, as I like to say, and when the poet starts milking—"

"Please. Quiet. No more."

"Goat!" cried Sam. "Cow. No, the answer is: a farmer's daughter. She is a lifeless creature which bites nothing. Except Matilda Bountibrow. We grew up together and she bit me once. Twice, actually. Back in Stoneco—"

This time, judge Balsafar's gavel broke. "In the name of ..."

"Name!" shouted Sam. "The name of a great man, like Sam Breakheart, carries more weight dead than alive."

"I do beg your pardon," Sam's attorney interjected. "My client is a first-borne son and as I like to say, the first-born is the family's udd—"

"A ship."

The sonorous baritone voice of the dragon covered all who were presented as if with molasses; for a few moments all were silent. Breakheart, of course, was the first to break it.

"Holy hell."

"Quiet in the court," said the judge, but his words had little effect while banging the pencil-like remains of his gavel. He had more the look of a conductor guiding the orchestra towards a majestic zenith.

"Holy *hell*," Sam repeated. "That was a fine riddle. A ship. Did you really think that up while stomping on my orchids?"

"Oh," said the great beast. "Indeed. I found my mind wandering to sea, to its bounty and dark allure, when I chanced upon an oaken wonder."

Sam's eyes went wide. "The oak tree in my backyard? My tree helped you think of that riddle?"

"... Indeed!"

A glimmer of a tear appeared in the corner of Sam's leftmost eye and he clapped his hands together with passion. "My tree! It's a fine one. I used to climb up there, when I was younger. Me and Matilda, we would howl like wolves at the sun! She'd bite me but I'd let her because we were playing a game of pretend, you see. She loved her riddles, she did. After she caught the cold of the night I'd entertain her with riddles of my own, at least on the days when her fever broke enough for her mind to make sense of my words ... Under that oak she lies now, and one day I expect to join her there for my everslumber. Truth be told, those orchids weren't rightfully mine. They were hers. Matilda's."

The great beast sniffled. "I'm sorry. All that treasure I hoard and I can't even recognize one planted before my clumsy feet."

"It's alright," said Sam. "That was a good riddle. You magnificent dragon bi—"
