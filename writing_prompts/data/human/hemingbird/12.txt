# Part 3

"We're not calling him John France."

"Why not?"

"First of all, it's not a name. Are you sure your cocktail guy isn't called John *Francis*?"

Paul scoffed. "Just check the certificate, Caro. John France DuMaine signed it."

She had checked the certificate, when she hung it on the refrigerator. But it had been photocopied so many times that the signature, which didn't look to have been legible at any time in the past either, could not be read by any mortal.

"Right," she said. "It's just that I don't like France. It makes me think of snails."

"Baby ... Why didn't you tell me sooner?"

Caroline shrugged. Paul leaned in for a hug.

The doorbell rang and it was their landlord, Henry. After collecting their rent, he gave them a helpful warning. "Watch out. There's a seagull out there, and it's *angry*." His face was pale and he looked frazzled. He hadn't even ironed his sweater vest.

After Henry left, Paul sighed. "Money's going to be tight from now on. We've got to feed John France."

Caroline frowned.

"John ... Germany?"

"Johngermany. If it's all in one word it sounds sort of classy and European."

"I guess so," said Paul. He smiled. "And if it's a girl, how about Sarahgermany?"

"I like it." Caroline was happy they were able to find a compromise.

That night, the egg hatched. To celebrate, Paul made margaritas. He served them in pilsner glasses. Caroline, however, was not in the mood.

"What's wrong?"

"It's just ..." Caroline stared at the child. Johngermany. It was a boy. Or at least so they thought. With all the tentacles, it wasn't all that easy to tell.

"What?"

"I'm just worried. What if he gets bullied?"

"Bullied? Why would he get bullied?"

"Well ... There's the tentacles. The horns. The claws. Andâ€”"

Paul embraced Caroline in a warm hug. "Sweetie. We can't be worrying over hypothetical bullies. Let's live in the present. Let's celebrate."

Caroline was amazed. Paul was perfectly happy with the situation. His attitude towards fatherhood was world-class, even if he didn't have the certificate to prove it. Maybe she'd make him one? And a World's Best Dad mug?

"Johngermany, this movie is called *In Bruges*. It's my favorite one."

"He's not old enough to watch a movie like that!"

"Eh, it's fine. It's not like he's going to remember."
