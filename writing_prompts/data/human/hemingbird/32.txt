Detresia is staring at herself in a pocket mirror, quietly sobbing. "There's smoke coming off of me ..."

"I told you I was sorry. It was an accident."

"It's my first time meeting a folder in person, and she scorches me. That's just my luck ..."

"I didn't even know I could do a thing like that. I'm totally disoriented."

She looks up at me, pouting. "As if. Of course you must know about folding. You're old."

I'm baffled. "Old? I'm only 30."

She arches her eyebrows while staring into her mirror. "Oh. Right. That's totally not old. Not at all."

"Hey. Easy with the sarcasm, missy."

I have decided this must be one of those dreams you have before dying. This is still Kuyakosho Street. It is a fantasy land produced by my brain. It must have been bored doing all those chores all these years, and it has come up with this place to entertain itself.

"Can you tell me more about folders?"

Detresia shrugs. "Do you promise not to set me on fire again?"

I put a hand to my heart. "I will try."

She frowns. "Well ... It feels weird explaining it to a fire folder, but I guess I'll do it anyways. So, folding is the art of magic manipulation. Asia Deathlace is a necromancer--a death folder. Elemental folders are the standard kind. No offense. Fire folders, water folders. That sort of thing. It's rare having magical abilities in the first place. I don't have them. You're the first I've met who can fold."

"Yes. That's what I always do when I play poker."

"What?"

"I *fold*."

Detresia shakes her head. "Do people lose their sense of humor when they turn 30?"

"Hey!"

We are interrupted by the sound of an explosion. The trees around us shake and birds flap their wings to escape.

"Wow! What was that? Detresia??"

She is sitting perfectly still, her eyes open wide. Is she shaking?

"Detresia? I think something just blew up. We should run."

"B-Barnacle beast," she says softly.

"Huh? Barnacles?"

She looks up at me. "I hope you're a good fire folder. Because if not ..."

There are loud footsteps, like a giant thumping a batting ram into the ground. Did she say ... barnacle beast?

I yank her dress, but she doesn't budge. "Let's run, Detresia. What are you waiting for?"

"They're too fast. And there's nowhere to run."

I look around, and she's right. There's the sea, but that sounds like the sort of place a barnacle beast might enjoy. "We should at least try. Maybe we can--"

Just then, the beast presents itself. It's a giant. Its body is all rock, covered in barnacles. It grunts.

"D-Detresia? W-What is that thing?"

"I told you," she says. "That's a barnacle beast."
