"Causal determinism is a lie! We are all connected through a morphic field! To fathom Hell or soar angelic, just take a pinch of psychedelic!"

Alessandro honked with the fury of an angered goose. My date Alissa, moved my hand off her zipper. "No. Just no. I know you warned me but this is just too weird. Sorry."

The tide-pulling giant in the skies was reflected in Alissa's eyes. They were dark like the water of a lake at dusk. "He's going to tire himself out soon. I promise."

"I have gazed into the mosaic soul of God!"

With a soft sigh Alissa stepped out of my half-fleshed sedan and walked off into the night. "At least let us drive you home," I pleaded.

"I'll take my chances," she said and that was that.

I slammed the steering wheel. "Dammit, Alessandro! You ruined my date. Again!"

There was a slight silence, then Alessandro revved the engine. The doors locked and the radio turned at maximum volume. It was Norman Greenbaum's 1969 one-hit-wonder Spirit in the Sky.

"W-What are you doing, Alessandro?"

"I'm a rebel. A rebel without causal determinism."

We soared angelic off the cliff, a red streak of a were-philosopher bitten by an acidhead crashing through the morphic field, enraged. The full moon, lacquered across Alessandro's hood, shone dispassionately.

I choked out a scream through Alessandro's death-defying honks.

And that was that.
