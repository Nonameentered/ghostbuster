I had my phone battery charged to 100%, weapons concealed in my every orifice, and int he trunk of my fully-fueled van was a back-up generator. This cabin out in the woods could just suck it; I'd come prepared for anything. That was when Gary, the token stoner of our group, pulled out his fursuit.

"What the hell is that, Gary?"

He looked up at me, blinking his long-lashed eyes. "You forgot to bring yours? Don't worry. I brought a spare."

Molly and Jack, the high-school sweethearts, stood holding theirs. Even Kathy, the slut, purred with excitement as she revealed a highly-revealing pink fursuit of her own.

"What's going on?" I said.

"You didn't get the memo?" Jack looked bedazzled. "I thought it was clear from the e-vite that this was going to be one heck of a steamy weekend."

Molly put her hands out towards me as if they were paws and scratched at plain air. "Me-ow," she said. "This weekend's gonna be purr-fect."

"No!" I cried out. "Nooooooooo!"
