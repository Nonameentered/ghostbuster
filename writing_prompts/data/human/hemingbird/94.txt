Sobek's nostrils flared with excitement, causing a moth that had been resting on its snout to flutter off in a hurry. "I like him," said Sobek, splashing up from the waters of the Nile. "I like him a lot."

Behind Anubis stood a red-haired man and the man's glasses clattered on his nose as he bit his fingernails. "Steve Irwin was a great friend of the crocodiles. He starred in moving pictures with them."

"Huh?" said Sobek. "Moving pictures? Pictures don't move. Pictures stand perfectly still."

"That's why they are called *moving* pictures," said Anubis with a snarl. In the realm of the living they are so popular that the humans just call them 'movies'. They don't have the time to say the whole thing, because they would rather spend it watching more moving pictures."

Sobek slapped the sides of his face. "Anubis!" he said. "The things you know! I am in awe."

Meanwhile, the human behind Anubis had squatted down and stared at his boots. "I suppose I have learned a thing or two from dealing with humans," said Anubis, letting out a slight yawn. He stretched out his arms, then took a step to the side to reveal the one hiding behind him. "Go on. Introduce yourself."

"Well. Uhm. Uhh ... Blimey! B-Bloody nice meeting you, uh, Mr. Alligator."

The human scratched his temples as sweat dripped from his brows. In shock, Sobek drew his eyeballs into their sockets and bellowed softly.

"Uh," said the human, looking up at Anubis. "D-Did I say something wrong?"

"Up, you scoundrel," said Anubis. "You are insulting Steve Irwin."

Sobek turned his head away from the pair. "I am not an alligator," he said and blew hot air from his nose.

"Ah, yes," said Anubis, turning to the human. "Sobek is only half alligator. The other half is human."

"No!" cried Sobek. "I am not half alligator! I am half crocodile!"

Anubis looked at Sobek, then at the human. "Steve Irwin is famous among the humans. I think he would know the difference."

"Look at my snout! Look at my great size! Am I dark green in color? No! Any fool could see that I am no alligator!"

"Well," said Anubis. "Isn't it also so that alligators are known for their aggression?"

"Aggression!" cried Sobek. "I am not aggressive! Say that again and I will bite your head off!"

Anubis stroked his chin and whelped. "Mr. Irwin?" he said.

The human, now pale as the dunes of the White Desert, adjusted his glasses. "B-Blimey," he said. "I see it now. I had the sun in my eyes so I couldn't tell properly. You are, uh, you are definitely a crocodile."

"The sun was in your eyes!" said Sobek. "Of course! You couldn't see." He turned around and shook a fist at the sun. "Damn you, Ra! You ruined my first meeting with a new friend!" Then he said, "Huh? The sun isn't there? Did I scare Ra off already?"

The three of them turned around to see the sun up high behind Anubis and the human. The two divine figures then stared at the red-haired man gulping in Duat as he partly hid his face behind his hands.

"... I'm sorry," said the human. "I can't hide it any longer. I'm not Steve Irwin. My name is Steve Irving and someone misheard it and suddenly people were clapping my shoulders and making a big fuzz about it. I wanted to correct them but one thing led to another and then it was all too late. I don't even look like him!"

A breeze passed between them. "Steve Irving. It does sound like Steve Irwin." Anubis folded his hands and nodded slowly.

Sobek sank back into the waters of the Nile and morosely blew some bubbles.

"Well, I am sorry for the mix-up, Sobek," said Anubis. "I'll leave you to do, uh, what you do."

As they turned to leave, Steve said, "I'm really sorry. Those people back there are real jerks. When I reveal I'm not actually Steve Irwin they'll go right back to treating me as a weirdo. Goodbye, Sobek."

"Weirdo?" said Sobek.

"Uh, yeah," said Steve. "I don't really get along with most people. I died choking on sushi in my office cubicle and I could hear my coworkers whisper to each other to 'just let it happen'."

"Sushi?" said Sobek, staring up at Anubis.

"Raw fish," said Anubis. "Eaten in large quantities with awkward utensils so that they won't eat it too fast in their excitement."

Sobek leapt back up from the water. "Raw fish?" he said. "I love raw fish! If you stayed here, we could have 'sushi' all the time! And if you choke on it you're already dead so it's fine!"

"Huh?" said Steve. "You'd want me here even if I'm not Steve Irwin?"

"Of course!" Sobek beamed. "A new friend!"

Steve smiled. Carefully, he waded down into the waters of the Nile while Anubis stood on the banks scratching his ear. "You're sure about this, Sobek?" he asked.

Sobek blew hot air from his nostrils. "Yes! I like him. I like him a lot."

Anubis stared at the unlikely duo splashing each other with water and thought to himself that it was quite a moving picture, and that he could see now why humans would be so infatuated with scenes such as the one before him.

From up high, Ra smiled as a moth passed in front of him.
