"Hiya Fred! We've got some sunshine on our hands, huh? That's good for the petunias."

As I watched my neighbor Steve's pasty face curl up in a disgusting smile I imagined worms feasting on it while he was buried alive. "If you don't shut up, Steve, I'll shove those petunias up where the sun don't shine."

"That would be a pleasure! Their oils make for a great lubricant, and me and Betty have been experimenting lately—"

Soon, he would be gone. Banished from the earth. Or at least Palmspring Avenue. I had planted a seed. A seed of destruction.

My alter ego is Papillon. For you illiterate blowhards out there, that means "butterfly." It's French. Like onion soup. After I accidentally ate 16 butterflies, I was blessed (and cursed) with the power of the butterfly effect: I can launch chain reactions resulting in any outcome I please.

"—the Ancient Greeks pegged each other all the time. Ever hear about the Eleusian Mysteries? That was their traditional pegging festival. Betty showed me a video about it. Plato? That was just his nickname, 'The Broad', referring to the girth of his—"

"Shut up, Steve. Shut up."

Steve did a little wave and sauntered off to tend to his precious petunias. He made me sick. Only the thought of his imminent fall kept me from snipping him into pieces with his own flower shears.

The days passed. An entire week went by. But no sign of ... anything.

Usually it happened instantaneously, like a well-oiled Rube Goldberg machine. I'd snap my fingers and the butterfly's wings would flap flap flap all the way to the ultimate prize. Like a cup of coffee falling into my hands because an amateur pilot got scared by a balloon dropped by a kid who stepped on a turd dropped by a dog who had just eaten some bad tuna discarded by an entrepreneurial chef whose wife just left him because she ate a fortune cookie with a message crafted by--you get it. That's the way it goes. That's the way it always goes. So why ...

I could see the two of them doing zumba in their living room. It was like watching jelly on a set of speakers blasting dubstep, shaking in seeming contempt of life itself. Were they mocking me? Or were they just trying to have a good time?

It was too much. This butterfly was going to have to spread some extra butter over these pesky flies.

My string trimmer eliminated their precious petunias in a matter of seconds. As the sun shone down on me I could feel the sweat of brilliance trickle down my forehead.

Later that day, I saw Steve on his knees in his garden, staring at the wreckage of his passion project. He sat like that for a good fifteen minutes.

When he got up, he approached me like a calm cow towards a plain patch of grass. "You deflowered me, Fred," he said, his voice thick with grief. "You snuck up into my backyard, you got out your massive tool, and you deflowered me."

"Don't say it like that, you slimy creep."

"And to think that we were going to ask you to join our weekend pegging circle. That's off the table, Fred."

"It was never on the table to begin with! Why on earth would you even think I'd want to be part of that ungodly abomination?"

Steve shook his head. "Do you know what petunias symbolize, Fred?"

"Perversion?"

"No, Fred. They symbolize passionate relationships. To me, they represent the best humanity has to offer. Friendship. Love. The joy of gaping into the glorious hole that is other people."

As he returned to his house I could hear music. It was ... somber piano zumba?

Whatever. I felt certain he wouldn't be bothering me anytime soon. So what if my Papillon powers failed me for the very first time? The true Papillon was my genius for revenge all along. I let out a long laugh and smiled as the wind carried off the scattered petals of my neighbor's petunias. Everything was just fine.

I took a nap and I dozed off. When I woke up, something was off. It was all dark. As I tried to get up to see what time it was, I discovered that I couldn't. I was trapped inside some sort of box.

"Hey! What's going on? Help!"

There was a deafening silence intermingled with my screams. Where was I? What had happened?

As I examined the box, I found a piece of paper and a cylindrical object. Oh no. That reeked of Steve. What on earth had he done to me?

Oh. It turned out to be a flashlight. I flicked it on, and saw that the piece of paper was a note.

> Dear Fred,
> 
> You are currently locked inside a box in our garden under the flower bed you destroyed. The sun will never shine on you again.

> We have decided to move far away. To Greece. We are confident our new neighbors there will have a better understanding and respect for our lifestyle.

> As for you, there is no hope.

> We drilled small holes in the box, and whatever you do the worms will find their way inside. Any sound you make will fail to escape. You don't have much oxygen, so you might as well stay quiet. But if you do want some sound for entertainment, we left you with a device loaded up with our favorite zumba tunes.

> Enjoy the last moments of your life.

> Pretty soon you will turn into beautiful petunias. Just like our last neighbors.

My desperate attempt to escape using my Papillon powers failed. Because this was part of the chain reaction resulting in Steve and Betty moving away. And the chain cannot be broken, even with other chains.

If only I had eaten 17 butterflies instead of 16 that day ... Perhaps then things would be different.

I cursed the wings of the butterfly with its flaps of torment. Without knowing it, I had dug my own grave. Become hoisted with my own petard.

A worm crawled up my cheek. In my head I heard my neighbor's disgusting voice ring out.

"Shut up, Steve!" I cried as the worm feasted. "Shut up Steve!"
