I've heard about local news establishments hiring ghost writers, but this is just nuts.

A legion of Caspers, fielding calls and tapping away at keyboards, haunted the scene before me. I'd been sent to slash them down. Jonah Buster, that's my name. But I'm not that kind of Buster. I've busted plenty of unions, but no ghosts.

"Our exposé on the refried beans that were actually only fried once got us a Pulitzer nomination." The apparition before me tugged at his bow-tie, beaming with pride.

"That's quite the Monster Mash," I said.

The news office went quiet. "What did you say?"

"Mash, as in mashed beans. And you know ... you're m—"

Office supplies poltergeisted through the air and one of the ghost journalists rattled a chain enraged. "We're not monsters! We're professionals! Do you even know how we all died?"

I hadn't thought about that part. "Overwork?"

"No! We were fried. Like beans. Then our corpses got fried again! That's right; we got refried. Maybe think twice before you open your mouth."

"B-By the bean company?"

The ghosts erupted into a séance of laughter. "You mere mortal fool. Journalism is a dead profession, you know, so it suits us just right."

"Just *wraith*, more like."

A huge printer flew through the air and crashed straight into me. I felt a warm liquid surrounding me. "I-Ink!? Phew, no ... It's just blood."

"Are you a guy sitting alone at a restaurant on a Friday night with an empty bottle of wine and a cold quiche? Because I think you just got ghosted."

I looked at my hands. I could see right through them. Never before had I been so transparent. "This can't be happening. This must be some kind of printer error."

The reporters started chanting, "Ghost! Ghost! Ghost!" and I realized that I was no longer Jonah. I was Ghost. Ghost Buster.

"Ghost!" I cried. "Ghost!"

I was done slashing budgets and busting unions. It was time to get spooky. And I had just the--"Uh, wait." A strange pull dragged me away from the news office and before I knew it I found myself outside some gates decorated with various pearls.

"Mr. Jonah Buster?"

A bearded dude with a clipboard eyed me with disinterest.

"That's me. But I, uh, I go by Ghost Buster now."

"Might as well change it to Angel Buster, buddy. You're in. Congrats."

"Wait, really? But what about all those reporters? They all became ghosts instead of angels."

"Oh, yeah. They tried to form a union. The big guy doesn't approve of that stuff. You, on the other hand, boy! You busted so many unions you made the big guy blush. Some angels have been talking about getting organized so ..."

"Oh. I'm here for ... work?"

The bearded guy shrugged. "That's how it is."

As I stepped inside, the Holy Ghost appeared before me. "Welcome, Buster. Care for a snack?" He tore open a can of refried beans.

It smelled like heaven.
