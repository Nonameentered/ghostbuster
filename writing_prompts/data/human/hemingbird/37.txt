Throughout the Milky Way, there's a human expression known to instill fear and anxiety in any being that hears it. It is an expression that sums up the strangeness of the humans, the almost psychotic attitude permeating their culture. No matter the technological innovation you can be sure that when, presented to the humans, they will say, "There's an app for that."

Flonk Flonk Flonk³ wandered the deck of his father's galaxy yacht in a nervous circle. They had picked up a human, as a prank, and just as they adjusted the probe they noticed there was an object already wedged inside the human's ... cavern.

"What's that?" asked second-in-command Blarn Blarn².

"Oh," said the human. "That's my remote-controlled vibrator. I control it with this app right here." The human pressed a button and immediately he began salivating.

Flonk Flonk Flonk³ stepped back, alarmed. "Blarn Blarn², what's the meaning of this? What is the human doing?"

"Oh," said Blarn Blarn², "you haven't heard? That's a smartphone. It can do pretty much anything, apparently."

The human lay there, apparently quite unconcerned with the general situation, as Blarn Blarn² explained. The smartphone was a dictionary, a calculator, a reservoir of art and music and literature, a communication device, a map, a GPS, and just about anything you could imagine.

"How could all of that fit inside a little rectangle?" Flonk Flonk Flonk³ couldn't believe it.

Blarn Blarn² shrugged. "They put their entire civilization inside them. Everyone of them has access to everything."

"Aren't you going to probe me?" the human said suddenly, sounding quite offended.

"You ... *want* to be probed?"

"I don't know," said the human, angrily. "It's sort of weird that you're just standing there. Didn't you bring me up here for some good, old probing?"

It was just supposed to be a prank. Flonk Flonk Flonk³ remembered huffing nebula gas with his bros earlier, when one of them suggested the idea of kidnapping a human. "They have these holes, right? And you can put stuff in them. It's pretty sick, bro."

The human sighed and loaded up a game on his smartphone. "Guess my first Wordle guess will be PROBE."

"Wordle?"

"Alright! Two greens! Beep beep! That's two hits of dopamine for me hehehe."

Flonk Flonk Flonk³ stared at his second-in-command. "Can we just beam him back down?"

"You don't want to do some light probing, just to get it over with?"

"No ... I don't feel like it anymore."

"FROTH! I got it on my third attempt let's go!"

They beamed the human back to their planet and for a long time Flonk Flonk Flonk³ stared out at the strange, blue marble filled with humans and magic rectangles.

This feeling inside him, this sense of emptiness he felt when reflecting on the brilliance and sheer stupidity of these beings ... was there a cure for it?

In his mind he heard an echo, a voice ringing throughout eternity itself, "There's an app for that."
