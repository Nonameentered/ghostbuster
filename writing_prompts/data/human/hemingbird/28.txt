The Saint Sava Temple, with its bottom-of-the-pool turquoise domes, stood encumbered by tourists with their smartphones and kitschy t-shirts. It was deserted.

"A vengeful spirit has made it its home," said a bread-necked barkeep who sold rakija, slivovitz, and little girls run away from their mothers. He grumbled about the lack of patronage and Borjan recognized in his eyes the attempt to suppress the feeling of drowning, the feeling that the breath of life had left one's side after years of intimate friendship. Such was the effect Borjan had on people.

It has been said that the Belgrade University Library, named after the great Svetozar Marković, would flood its halls with carbon dioxide were a fire to break out, suffocating flames and readers alike. Borjan assumed this to be a myth though the idea had occurred to him that he might play a prank, that he might enter the library with a lit candle and release a deathly scream. The visitors would no doubt take their sense of primal fear to be an effect produced by gas and it would take hardly any time at all for mass hysteria to grip every single person inside; even the librarians who ought to know better.

"It's an aždaja," said Borjan.

"A dragon?" The barkeep clearly wanted to laugh, but something inside him prevented it. Borjan produced a tension that could not be relieved by laughter. "Why do you say it's a dragon? Surely it's an atheist who lived a life of sin. It must be a shock, to a godless man, to see that he has been mistaken. So he haunts the Sava out of bitterness. That's my guess."

Even while subduing his presence to the best of his abilities, the faint traces that escaped Borjan were enough to render the face of the barkeep pale and laced with dread. "No," said Borjan. "It is an aždaja. It has come for you."

The barkeep squinted at Borjan, his fish-like eyes almost retracting into their sockets. "For me? And just why would a dragon come for me?"

"Perhaps," said Borjan, "the aždaja enjoys the taste of sinners." With this, Borjan let go of the blanket he had wrapped himself in, let go of the dam that kept his sinister aura from overflowing, and he let it all wash over the man before him.

With a shrill cry, clutching his off-white shirt as if it were a lifejacket, the barkeep leapt into the air. He crashed into the shelves of bottles behind him and awash in rakija he fell shivering to the dirty floor. From the immediate smell it was apparent that though he was now frozen with fear, the barkeep's bowels had evacuated. "Ohhhh," he moaned, clutching at his lonely strands of hair. "Ohhhhh ..."

"What's the matter?" said Borjan. "Has the aždaja come for you?"

In a quiet tone almost inaudible, the barkeep said, "Help me. You were right. It's here for me."

"You can feel it?"

"I can feel it."

"Good," said Borjan. "That means that the dragon has begun its feast."

A catatonic wailing ensued and Borjan helped himself to a bottle of slivovitz. When he was little, Borjan's mother had read him and his sister stories of aždajas such as the many-headed Chudo-Yudo. During one reading session he had asked his mother if dragons were real and she had grown quiet, taking her time to find an appropriate reply, and in the end she said simply, "Yes."

Borjan had spent weeks in the Saint Sava Temple, the favorite place of his sister. It was where she wanted to get married. Her childhood sketches littered her old bedroom, now tear-stained. One day, he had heard a rumor in the temple. About a barkeep with various ... proclivities.

"Help me ..."

"Oh, help is coming. Death is of great help to a sinner."

The barkeep clutched his chest as his face shifted blue, blue like the unrelenting skies above. Then he was silent. Borjan struck a match and thought about the library, about suffocating flames. And with that he set fire to the man.

Back in the Saint Sava Temple Borjan sat down on an old wooden bench and concentrated on regaining control over his overpowering presence.

"Can you feel that?"

"W-What's going on?"

The tourists and churchgoers who had arrived during a moment of peace and quiet again sensed the remains of Borjan's aura.

"Haven't you heard? It's a vengeful spirit."

Borjan turned his head. "It's an aždaja," he said.

They stared at him, clearly puzzled.

"Leave him," said one of them. "Can't you smell the alcohol on him? Clearly he's a drunkard."

Borjan closed his eyes, and he smiled. His mother had been right. Dragons were, in fact, real.
