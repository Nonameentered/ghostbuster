"I'm going into the water and you can't stop me. Eh!"

Tobias had always yearned for the ocean. Its seductive allure. Its splashy waves. It was as if it were designed to draw him closer. Which was why his upbringing had been torture; the sea was forbidden. For a hundred years and a fifty more it had been abandoned though no one could remember why. All they knew was that it was to be avoided and that was the end of it. Until Tobias came along.

"Nooo, Tobias don't go into the water. We're not supposed to. Eh!"

The ocean throbbed before him. The smell of salt permeated the air and seagulls squawked brilliantly above. "Ocean!" cried Tobias. "I have come for thee!"

And that was when the Lord appeared before him, rising from the froth of the waves, saying, "Hi there, Tobias! Come on in. The water is great."

As Tobias looked up at the Lord, he paused. "What are you wearing? Eh! Is that ... Is that a fursuit?"

The Lord guffawed. "In the ocean, I adopt the form of my fursona Terry Taffler. Come on in, Tobias. Come on in."

"I ... I don't feel like it anymore. Eh."

From that day forth humanity abandoned the ocean for good.
