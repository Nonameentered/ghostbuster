The long corridors, endless snakes eating all ambition, all thick in the bowel of the beast preying on the Narcissus lurking within humanity: they made me wretch.

Cubicles and walls and chairs and pillows all white and blue, white and blue, like a cloud passing through the atmosphere on a quiet day: all white and blue. Like the eyes and skin of my son when the sick got him: all white and blue. Like Ahab's white whale, that leviathan of hubris; all white and blue.

A few heads turn. Security officers. I don't show up on their cameras, and they can't understand why. Don't worry. It's not your necks I'm after.

Glowing screens moth-bulbing my prey with their loops of deprivation and satisfaction. It all hinges on making them feel empty, that there is some need unfulfilled, and they provide temporary relief allthewhile furthering their deprivation with every click and swipe and fumbling over glass.

And there he is: Burt Mackerberg. The human incarnation of the uncanny valley with the stoicism of an unrepenting serial killer. The man responsible for poisoning my prey, driving them away, giving them all devices that when pointed in my direction reveals it all.

He stands still, a clockwork of flesh, and I charge with the fury and rage innate to my kind.

A whelp escapes the the skin-covered automaton and before he can blink, if he were capable of such, I tear up his neck with my teeth.

And it's all white and blue, white and blue. And red.

Red cubicles and walls and pillows. Red screens glowing red.

That cloud passing through the atmosphere has, in its impermanence, diffused into nothingness.

On rectangular glass Burt Mackerberg inexplicably bursts into blood.

My satisfaction is great, though I know it to be temporary. There will always be another Burt Mackerberg. But wherever those like him surface, I will rise and break the tension and swallow them whole.

Burt Mackerberg gurgles off to his journey to infinity and the security officers stand, mouths agape, clutching spray bottles. Pepper, lads? You are only seasoning my meal.

And so I leave behind the long corridors, having slain the beast, and its disgusting white and blue.

I only hope that when humanity gazes into their rectangles to witness this event that they make like glass and reflect.
