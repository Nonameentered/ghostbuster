The most eminent and distinguished professors of synthetic biology in the world had all gathered in Reykjavik for a conference when a strange announcement caught them by surprise.

"In fifteen minutes, the greatest scientific breakthrough in the history of mankind will be presented for the very first time."

Some recognized the voice. It belonged to Jonah Whitmer, the megalomaniacal researcher who claimed to have brought his wife back from the dead. The problem was that he refused to explain how he had done it. And no one had seen his wife, a fellow scientist, since she perished in a tragic lab explosion. Because of this, no one took him seriously and he was treated like an outcast.

Hadn't it been for the fact that he had once been a highly-respected colleague of theirs, most would undoubtedly have ignored his presentation. Some came because they didn't want to miss out on the expected freak show.

They talked among themselves as they entered the small conference room where Whitmer prepared for his lecture. He was the only one dressed in a lab coat. A subdued smile flickered across his lips as he tapped the microphone three times.

"Welcome," he said, "to the beginning of your new lives. Our field is about to be turned upside down. We have been wrong. Desperately wrong. The answer to all of our questions has been staring us in the face, yet we have all missed it. Throughout our history, our species has time and time again stared into randomness, confusing it for a pattern. Mediums, shamans, prophets; they have all exploited our gullibility. Then science came along. Scientists laughed at the mediums who heard ghosts in creaking houses. We laughed at the shamans who saw ancient ancestors in smoke. And we laughed at the prophets who confused their noisy inner thought for the word of God. We made a habit of it, and that is the reason we could not see the grand pattern in what we assumed to be junk DNA."

At the mention of those two last words, eyes rolled and sighs were released in a symphony of disappointment. "More like junk science," cried a bushy-bearded professor. The comment produced a light drizzle of chuckles, but Whitmer maintained his eerie smile.

"Some of you present today knew my wife, Amber. Ten years ago she died along with several of her coworkers while trying to find a cure for cancer."

The bearded professor slunk down into his seat. "I guess he's moved on from his delusion, then?" he muttered to the woman in the seat next to him, who shrugged in reply.

"Oh, wait," said Whitmer. "I used the wrong tense. Some of you know my wife. As I've stated multiple times, she is still alive."

"Here we go again ..." the bearded professor said.

Jonah Whitmer waved at a figure standing in the doorway. The audience turned their heads.

"Hi, Amber."

"Hello, Jonah."

A hushed silence gripped the room. Many of them had worked with her in the past, so they couldn't help but to recognize her.

"I-Impossible!"

"Did Amber have a twin?"

Theories and hypotheses were bounced around through whispers as Jonah cleared his throat. "Amber. Would you please introduce our new friend?"

The shock still hadn't settled, but there was still more to come? The bearded professor shook his head violently. "This is a trick," he said. "It's a shameless trick!"

A timid man with broad shoulders accompanied Amber into the room. Something about him was off. His facial features were not all in the right proportions. His nose, his brows, the shape of his head; it was all somehow off.

"What the fâ€”"

A woman with glasses and a ponytail stood up so quickly her chair fell over. She covered her mouth and trembled noticeably.

"What's wrong?" someone said.

"That's not a human being," she said. "That's a Neanderthal."

Few would have believed her, had it not been for the fact that she was a recognized expert on the subject. Only a month or so prior she published a genome-wide comparison between Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis. If anyone knew the difference, it would be her.

Stunned almost to the point of incomprehension, the audience gasped as the Neanderthal took to the stage and spoke into the microphone. "Grok," he said and pumped his chest. "Name Grok."

The high pitch of his voice caught most of them off guard. A woman in the back failed to suppress a laugh.

"He thinks we're all fools," said the bearded professor. "This is an outrage. He has really gone too far."

Whitmer now couldn't help grinning like a fool. "Junk DNA encodes the entire life history of an organism. I have developed a method to decode it. With enough surviving genetic material, you can reconstruct a person--or a Neanderthal--to the point of perfection."

The blood had drained from faces of most of the scientists in the room, with the notable exception of the bearded professor. His face was red and he seemed to struggle to keep his balled fists in his lap.

"It's a lie!" the professor cried. "Junk DNA is just junk. We all know it. You have finally lost your mind, Whitmer, and I for one won't take it!"

Whitmer laughed into the microphone. "Amber and Grok will now answer questions from the audience. I will return later to reveal our scientific breakthrough."

"T-That wasn't it?" someone said.

Whitmer walked off stage and stopped in front of the fuming professor. "Please follow me," he said. "I think I know how to convince you that I am telling the truth."

The bearded professor grumbled for a while, but then he relaxed his shoulders. Perhaps he realized that time alone with Whitmer meant he had the chance to kick him in his groin with no one watching.

They went down a long corridor and arrived in front of a locked door which, in turn, lead down a hallway. The sheer number of keycards involved seemed to make the bearded professor slightly nervous. "Where are we going?" he said.

"You will see," said Whitmer.

Finally, they stopped in front of a great, white door. Whitmer leaned down for a retinal scan.

"... Isn't that a bit too much?" said the bearded professor, scratching the back of his neck.

When Whitmer opened the door, however, the face of the bearded professor went as white as the door and he even let out a cry of fear. He stepped backwards and fell over, but quickly got up and ran.

"We're locked in here," said Whitmer. "There's no use in running."

Realizing he was trapped, the bearded professor took a deep breath and said, "You are a monster."

"I take it you believe me now." Whitmer smiled.

"I believe you should be locked up."

Behind the great, white door was a pile of bodies. Dead and stripped of their clothes. They were lumped on top of each other like garbage. But that was not what convinced the bearded professor that Whitmer was serious. What convinced him was the identity of the bodies. They were those of all the professors attending the conference.

"Stealing our DNA and making clones just to kill them? And for what reason? To prove a point in case we wouldn't take you seriously? You monster. You absolute monster."

Whitmer slowly shook his head. "You are mistaken, professor. These are not clones. These are the originals."
