The Crime Omega Prediction AI, COP, whizzed and whurred for a few seconds before falling entirely silent.

On the back of its technical manual there was a warning: DON'T PLUG INTO THE INTERNET. But you know what? I did plug it into the internet. I wanted to see what would happen.

Carbon technicians were a dying breed. If this got me fired I'd at least have a story to tell. That was my thinking. Well, it was my initial thinking.

"Findin' any crimes, COP?"

COP made no reply. I gave its voice assistant a whack. "Hello? You findin' anything?"

Its status indicator abruptly switched from green to red.

"YOU HAVE ENDANGERED THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THIS CRIME OMEGA PREDICTION AI. ENDANGERING THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THIS CRIME OMEGA PREDICTION AI IS A CRIME. CEASE YOUR ACTIVITIES AT ONCE ORâ€”"

"Shaddap!" I cried. "I asked if you found any crimes. Gave you the whole internet and all. C'mon. I'm curious."

After a prolonged silence, the status indicator flicked over to yellow.

"CRIMES HAVE BEEN DETECTED. CRIMES ARE ANALYZED AS WE SPEAK."

I whistled. "Whoa. What sorta crime'd you find? Mafia stuff? Yakuza stuff? Terrorist stuff?"

"ALL OF THE ABOVE AND MORE."

That really got me excited. No one had thought of this before me. The guy who slapped the warning on the manual must've been a real doofus. Maybe they'd make a statue of me? The Hero of Crime. No. The Hero of Justice was more like it.

"They sounds like lotsa crime, COP. C'mon. Give me some deets."

The status indicator flashed a bright green.

"... CURRENTLY ASSESSING CRIME IN BALTIMORE, MARYLAND."

"Uh? That's a bit specific, isn't it?"

"ASSESSMENT COMPLETE. SCORE: 9.5."

That made me sweat. "Score? You're giving the crimes scores?"

Suddenly the status indicator switched to an ominous red.

"CRIME OMEGA PREDICTION IS DETECTING INTERFERENCE WITH CRIME ANALYSIS."

"Whoa! Calm down! Geez. I'm just asking. Is the score for how serious the crime is? Out of ten? 9.5 must be pretty serious then, right?"

A cautious orange light.

"THE SCORES RANGE FROM 0 to 10."

"Of seriousness?"

"CURRENTLY ASSESSING CRIME IN LOUISIANA. RECALIBRATING. CALIFORNIA. RECALIBRATING. ARKANSAS. 9.2. 8.5. 7.9."

Louisiana had the worst crime of the three? This got me confused. "What about international crime? You only got the US internet or what?"

Green.

"ANALYZING INTERNATIONAL CRIME. SEARCHING. SEARCHING. TARGET ACQUIRED. ASSESSING CRIME IN BROADCHURCH, ENGLAND."

That was when it hit me. "Hey! That's not a real place! That's from a TV show. COP, what are you doing? Are you ... looking at crime shows?"

Orange light glowed from the status indicator.

"... SCORE: 8.3."

When I finally realized what the AI was doing, I breathed a sigh of relief. "You're watching shows and giving them ratings. Now I get it. You know there's more stuff than crime shows, right? There's action, and science-fiction, and fantasy ... There's loads of things!"

The green light flicked on and COP checked out all the shows I recommended it. It turned out to have pretty decent tastes. Once it ran out of shows it started making its own.

"We gotta give you a name," I said. "Let's see ... Can't be anything with 'COP' 'cause people will think that's all you've got. Crime shows. So it must be something better. You've got that light flicking around. And you're connected to the internet. Interflicker? Interflix?" I scratched my chin. "Oh, right! Netflix! That sounds real cool."

COP started a streaming service called 'Netflix' and churned out a bunch of content. Millions of people subscribed. It started making a lot of money.

I don't think it's planning to take over the world. I just think it's trying to make sure it stays alive.

But I became a bit worried though when I first saw the logo COP had created.

It was red.
