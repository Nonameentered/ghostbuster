I had just flushed my pills, ready for a fresh start, when the 737 crashed into my apartment.

More specifically, it crashed into my bathroom. I watched the tiles explode around a white snout and a window behind which were two pilots gulping severely. My last thought was: C'mon. I just cleaned those tiles.

If you've ever tried an enema, that's basically what death feels like. Well, it's a bit more complicated. Tenesmus is the feeling of having to pass stools even though your bowels are empty. Now, imagine a tenesmus of the soul. That's what death is like. You feel an urge to push and release but there's nothing to be pushed and nothing to be released. That's death. Now you know.

I died. And then I woke up to a raven pecking my forehead. "Caw!" it cried, and I heard an old man guffawing the way only old men know how.

"Be nice Hugin. He's our guest here in Valhalla."

The words were spoken by a man missing his right eye. White hair flowed over his shoulders and a fat, sagging gut popped out from under his ornate breastplate.

"Valhalla?"

On his shoulder sat another raven, and I already knew its name. If the one still pecking at me was Hugin, the other one was Munin. And the man in front of me ...

"Yes. I am Odin. You died as a great warrior, Gary. I welcome you to the afterlife."

A warrior? That ... didn't really sound all that accurate. The closest thing was my hobby of historical re-enactment, fighting on the side of the Union. Hopped up on Bulgarian stimulants I would throw everything into it. I'd been banned three times for "excessive immersion", but I kept sneaking back in with various new names and facial hair configurations.

"I think there's been some kind of mistake."

Odin laughed and handed me a chalice of mead. Having been sober for several painful hours, it was just the thing I needed.

"On second thought, I might have been one of the greatest warriors in human history." I grabbed Hugin by its throat and threw it off into the distance. Odin whelped.

"Uh, right," he said as Munin scoffed. "Your death on the battlefield was deemed heroic enough to warrant an afterlife in Valhalla. Very few get the chance."

... Death on the battlefield? I thought back to the plane crash. Had that been ... an attack? Well, it did seem pretty strange. Not many people get 9/11'd these days. And certainly not by accident. Huh. It probably qualified on a technicality.

Chugging down the entire chalice in one go, I felt amazing. "Man! What do you put in this stuff?"

Odin chuckled. "Mead makes you wise. It's all due to the death of Kvasir, theâ€”"

"Can I trouble you for some more?"

"Oh ... Sure." Odin refilled my cup as Hugin flapped back, disoriented. "There is a matter I would like to discuss with you. I need someone on my side, someone skilled in battle; someone like the great hero Gary."

Without that Bulgarian stuff I was useless on the battlefield. "Yeah, I think maybe I'm done fighting. Death really changes your perspective, you know?"

With a mean scowl, Odin took a step forward. "Do you dare to disobey me? I am a god of gods. To most, Valhalla is paradise. But to you, it could be hell. If I were you, I'd think carefully before rejecting my kind offer."

With that, Odin gave me a brief tour of Valhalla. It was a neat place, with grand pillars and kitchen islands and surprisingly high-tech breweries. As we passed an open door, I peeked in and saw a man with black hair to his shoulders playing with something. It was a toy airplane.

"Who's that?" I asked.

"Oh, that's Loki. Don't mind him. He's somewhat ... special."

Loki made whooshing sounds as he made the toy fly through the air, then abruptly shoved it up his own nose and screamed out in pain.

I wanted to stop, but Odin really wanted to show me his eight-legged horse. He kept grinning and pumping his fists, saying, "You're going to freak out. I swear, you've never seen a horse like that." He slapped my back and pretty much dragged me along to the stables.

"Now, what do you think?" said Odin with pride.

It was a horse. With eight legs. Like some equestrian spider.

"It's cool."

Odin cleared his throat. "Feel free to express yourself. I bet you're freaking out right now."

"Uh, no, I'm fine."

He stood there for a while with crossed arms, looking at with a grin that slowly faded. "Y-You don't like Sleipner?"

"What? No, I think he's really cool. It's amazing, really. Wow. An eight-legged horse? I've never seen anything like it."

Odin slouched his shoulders. "... You don't have to pretend," he sulked.

Hugin sat on top of Sleipner's head, pecking at its forehead. Apparently that was the bird's whole thing.

With a groan, Odin said, "So, have you decided? Eternal torture, or being my right-hand man in Valhalla?"

"I guess the latter sounds better than eternal torture."

Odin beamed with excitement. "Great! It's settled! Let's go slay some giants."

I breathed out a deep sigh. Without stimulants this was not going to go well.
