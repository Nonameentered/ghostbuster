"Welcome to Gigastore!"

Teriyaki Williams flashed his warmest grin to all the customers arriving, and it almost made him feel as life *wasn't* a bitter illusion bereft of meaning and it nearly made him think that the earth was no insignificant marble stranded in an uncaring universe; it was his home, and Gigastore was his home within a home.

"Thank you for shopping at Gigastore!"

An elderly man in a flannel shirt scoffed and grunted as he left with his groceries. Teriyaki let out a brief sigh. He had applied for 200 jobs before finally getting hired as a greeter. After people found out he was a mere decoy, no one wanted anything to do with him. They were afraid he'd tarnish their reputation. What kind of place would hire a decoy? But Gigastore was different. Well. At least the one run by his uncle.

"You doing alright, Pete?"

Teriyaki cleared his throat.

"Oh. Right. Sorry. You doing alright, *Teriyaki*?"

The Hero Company used a random name generator for its heroes, and Pete had gotten one that was a Japanese cooking technique. There was no deeper meaning. Still, he had been happy. He could shorten it to Teri, and that sounded alright. And at least it was better than GROB.

"Absolutely. I'm fine. I'm loving this. This isn't demeaning at all."

Uncle Ron rubbed the back of his neck. "Good," he said. "It isn't meant to be. It's honest work. People come here, and they want to see a friendly face. Everyone is lonely these days. Some slight feeling of belonging can be just the thing they need, you know?"

Just a year earlier, Teriyaki thought his future had been settled. He would become the legendary hero in charge of saving mankind. He would defeat the Stronglobsters and he would win the hearts and minds of everyone on planet Earth. Then it was all taken away. And he was told it had all been a mirage anyhow.

"Of course! I like it. I really do. I feel fulfilled."

"That's, uh, that's the spirit," said uncle Ron. He gave a thumbs up and went on his way, leaving Teriyaki alone in front of the revolving door where strangers entered and left and mostly ignored the guy hired to make them feel special and cherished.

Then the revolving door revolved, and the most terrifying being Teriyaki could imagine stepped inside Gigastore: GROB. GROB had entered the shop.

"Fuck," said Teriyaki.

"Excuse me?" GROB's feather-suit bristled in the light breeze from the doors and his aura of purple magic surrounded him like a swarm of butterflies.

"Eh! I mean, welcome ... to Gigastore."

"Wait, there's something familiar about you ..."

Teriyaki wanted to crawl under the floor tiles. What was GROB doing here? What did he even need? Did he want to buy a shovel he could use to pummel the heads of the Stronglobsters? Or perhaps a set of seafood forks?

"I'm Pete! You've probably just seen me here before."

"No," said GROB. "This is my first time here. Usually, my handlers do my shopping. I wandered in because of curiosity. It's interesting to see how commoners live, you know?"

"Super interesting! Well, I hope you have a nice time!"

"Wait! Now I remember. You're that guy. Mr. Soy Sauce. No. Srirachi. Wait, don't tell me. Oh, yes! You're Teriyaki! The decoy!"

Teriyaki responded with five seconds of jazz hands. It was too long, it seemed, for GROB looked deeply uncomfortable. "Are you here on a stealth mission?" he asked.

"No," said Teriyaki. "I just work here. My uncle runs the place. So. Yeah."

GROB blinked furiously. "What? But I thought you had really high-class magic skills."

"Well, being a hero is mostly about image," said Teriyaki, shrugging. "Once people stop caring about you, it doesn't matter what you can do. Besides, my powers would be more suited to villain than a hero. I can teleport bones. Even if I teleported a villain's bones all the way to Kathmandu, people wouldn't see me as a real hero, would they? The poor guy would turn into jelly. It would be terrifying."

"Oh," said GROB. "What about chickens?"

"Chickens?"

"Yeah. Boneless chickens. That's a thing, right? You could zap their bones away. And fish. I'm sure there's a market for it."

For some reason, the thought of working in a factory zapping off animal bones was the last straw for Teriyaki. "Or I could just lean into the villain thing. I've even got a nice catchphrase: I've got a bone to pick with you!"

GROB winced. Then Teriyaki sent his bones to Kathmandu.

Descended into a feathery, skin-floppy mess, GROB tried to scream but couldn't. The nearby Gigastore shoppers, however, could. And they did.

"Pete! What have you done?"

"Uncle!" cried Teriyaki. "I have a bone to pick with you too! And you! And you!"

All over the store, bones were teleported to various far-off places. "Welcome to Gigastore!" he screamed. "I'm a bona fide villain!"

Suddenly, he found himself surrounded by boneless shoppers slopping around. They lay in skin pools all around, and they all wore expressions of intense horror. "What have I done?" said Teriyaki. He stared at the revolving door in front of him. His future had been robbed of him. Did that give him the right to rob these people of their bones? And with GROB incapacitated, who would fight the Stronglobsters?

His bone teleportation magic only worked one way. Soon, these human pools would dry up and the world would come to know Teriyaki as a villain. Was that truly what he wanted?

"... I'm such a bonehead," Teriyaki said, softly. No one laughed. Instead, they flopped.

GROB slowly turned blue. It appeared he was suffering greatly. "I'll throw you a bone," said Teriyaki and stepped on him. He splashed into a wet mess. It was the last bone joke Teriyaki had prepared.

A heavyset man rode through the revolving doors on a mobility scooter. He stopped abruptly once he saw the horrifying scene before him.

"Welcome to Gigastore," said Teriyaki. A flash of divine inspiration struck him. "Allow me to tickle your funny bone. You'll find that I'm quite humerus."

Teriyaki decided then and there. He would build an empire of bones. Gigabone island. And the world would feel sorry for having tossed him aside as a decoy.

The heavyset man fell off his scooter as he tried to flee. "You're not laughing?" said Teriyaki. "Just you wait. I'll make you crack up."
