"You look quite sinister today, Finklebob!"

Finklebob turned toward me in a rage. "I told you never to use that name again! Since I made my pact with Gh'roan I have been reborn and my name is now Veath the Tormentor."

A sparrow flew past us, singing cheerfully.

"I'm sorry, Fin—I mean *Veath*. Kinda sounds like 'wet', doesn't it? Like 'wet the bed'."

Veath the Tormentor placed his face less than an inch from mine and he stared into my eyes, his eyebrows shaking. "Where did you hear that rumor?"

I didn't understand. "What rumor?"

Veath groaned. "All my life I have been running from that rumor, the despicable lie that I on occasion wet myself in bed. I made a vow to kill any man or woman or even chicken who dared mention it to me again."

I twiddled my fingers. "I think that bird that flew past us maybe heard it."

With a dramatic flair, Veath lifted his cape and stretched out his arm. A bolt of light-green lightning flashed from his hand and toward the bird. It burst into flames and fell from the skies.

"G-Good murdering," I said.

"Yes," said Veath the Tormentor. "The dark power surges through me. I can feel it. I think I am ready to face the Council."

The Council of Elite Wizards controlled everything like the supposedly-benevolent cabal they were. There had always been stories of heroes duking it out with dark lords and this narrative of good versus evil had kept the dim-witted populace relatively satisfied for a long, long time. People didn't rise up against a dark lord. It was too scary. People didn't complain when a great hero raised taxes. He's a hero, he probably knows what he's doing. That's what people would say.

Together with Veath the Conqueror, I felt strangely calm. I don't think he suspected anything. In my heart I knew precisely what he was, but I don't think he knew this for himself.

We made it to the Council intact, after defeating legions of evil minions. Though the realm seemed to oscillate between Hero and Dark Lord, it was really all the same, really just a bunch of arrogant wizards deciding things behind the scenes. Even the minions changed roles with the times. One day they're evil minions, the other they're noble guards. It's all the same.

When Veath blew open the doors, the wizards were in the middle of some sort of fight club. They punched each other in their long, bearded faces, and they stood in circles cheering each other on. That is, until they saw us standing amid thunder and smoke. "Guards!" cried a wizard. "I mean, uh, minions! Come at once!"

"I'm afraid your hired protection is not available at the moment. Also: what are you guys doing?"

They sort of stared at each other, as if caught fondling fruit at the market. "It's a wizard thing. You wouldn't get it."

"Ahem," said the wizard with the longest beard of them all. "I see that you're a thunder mage. Pretty embarrassing. That's like, what, tier 4 magic? What a joke. A little crackling and static electricity? You probably spent it all blowing the door off its hinges. Me, I'm a fire mage. Tier 2, you know. Yup. Powerful stuff. So. Maybe you should take your little elf-boy with you and beat it, huh? Maybe you should get lost, you little piece of—"

Only his boots remained after Veath shocked him to dust. The rest of the Council stood there, dumbfounded. "H-He was the most powerful one of us," said one of them. "His back was even all crooked because he had to lean over to stroke his beard, that was how long it was!"

"Who's next?" said Veath and the room fell into silence, sans the light sizzling of the boots.

"Wait, isn't that ..."

A thin-bearded wizard in an intensely-yellow robe stepped forward, his eyes big and round with wonder. "Finklebob, is that you? I haven't seen you since our days of youth."

"Y-You have mistaken me for someone else!"

"No, I know that mean old scowl! You're Finklebob! Hey, do you still wet the bed every night? Your mama used to complain to everyone in the village, said you pissed the way your old man drank: unburdened by mortal limitations. She said your stream was like the hiss of a snake, maybe even a dragon! Dragon-pisser! That's what we used to call you! Hahahaha it's Finklebob the Dragon Pisser!"

Oh, how they laughed. I couldn't help but smile. This small moment of laughter, there was something precious in it. Like a look of fragile hope in a man's eyes before he's sent to the gallows. I smiled as the air grew heavy with the taste of copper and smoke. I smiled as the wizards boiled before me in their robes, a sanguine sous-wide with their own skin as bags. They burst and crackled and went limp. It took seconds. It took only seconds before Veath the Tormentor had turned their little fight club into a massacre.

Veath sat on the floor for a long time, panting like a fragile bird. "I'm the dark lord now," he said. I could see the conflict in his eyes. "It is time for my evil reign to commence."

I shook my head. "No," I said.

He turned his head toward me. It was filled with confusion. "What do you mean? I have reborn. I have been granted powers by the great Gh'roan. It is my time to rule."

"Yes," I said. "You have been granted powers, and it is indeed your turn to rule."

"Then why did you shake your head? Do you not believe I have what it takes?"

I stared at the massacred cabal before me, a bath of bubbling blood and catatonic wizards. "I believe you have what it takes, but not as a dark lord."

"Then what?"

"I think it is time for this realm to have its first true reign of a hero."

The word seemed to bounce around his mind. He stood up and he furrowed his brows gravely. "A hero? Look at what I've done. Is this the act of a hero?"

"The wizards have been killing innocents left and right. That's how they maintain the Dark Lord period of their rule. They commit unspeakable evil. And you stopped them. You have brought peace to the realm. Is that the act of a dark lord?"

"I am Veath the Tormentor."

"No," I said, and I placed a hand on his shoulder. "You are Veath the Tormented."

The face that stared up at me was the face of Finklebob. "But what about the sparrow?"

"Do you feel bad for having killed it?"

Finklebob shrugged. "I don't know. Maybe."

"Then give meaning to its sacrifice. Give the sparrows of the realm a reason to sing."

And so it was. Finklebob the Friend of Dragons made it a crime to disrupt the singing of birds and he ended the Dark Lord period that had been slowly suffocating the realm. He instituted policies meant to help the weak and the poor and he used his powers to restore justice.

After a long and peaceful rule, Finklebob passed quietly from the realm of the loving. His funeral was attended by a great crowd of mourners whose lives had been bettered by their kind king. A lone sparrow flew in and perched atop his casket. It sang a cheerful song.
