"It's nice watching the boats pass by, isn't it?"

Todd sat besides Eleanor, his brows gently furrowed, and he took a sip from his glass of pickle juice while nodding his head. Eleanor hadn't complained when he tugged at her sleeve, asking if it was fine that he brought along the pickle jar for their walk. She was so surprised he'd agreed to come along that it didn't even occur to her that Todd had always hated pickles. When she spotted a newspaper headline reading, "PHLAMPTOWN BODY SNATCHER ON THE LOOSE," she put two and two together and weighed her options in her head. Sure, having a body snatcher as your boyfriend might not be ideal. It doesn't adhere to typical standards. But in this crazy world, what sort of couples did? Doesn't a duo of normal people acting all normal in an absurd world bring to mind images of robots and automatons and 60s Hollywood stereotypical communists? It's dystopian. Crazy people in a crazy world aren't the ones going against the grain, so why judge them? Why not accept the fact that Eleanor now had a body snatcher for a boyfriend and get over it already?

"You sure like your pickles," said Eleanor. A seagull flew overhead. It attracted Todd's attention. He dropped his pickle jar and it shattered on ground, its contents rolling and dripping, and passersby turned their heads towards the strange couple seated on a dock bench. As Todd stretching his arms out, trying to catch the seagull mid-flight, Eleanor wondered whether this situation was really all above board.

"It's flying," said Todd, with a look of scornful anger. He hissed and jumped, but the seagull seemed to find it amusing to tease him by diving just close enough that he thought he could reach it before soaring back up into the skies.

"Maybe it's time to head home. I'll pick up the broken pieces," said Eleanor. As she said it, a strange feeling twisted inside her. That was what she had told herself when she and Todd first met: she'd pick up the broken pieces. She'd put them together. She'd treat him like a renovation project, a fixer-upper, and everything would work out just fine. Like most renovation project you don't see on TV, it had been a humbling disaster. Todd was fine, she was horrified to learn, being Todd. He was fine with flying into a rage when she asked him to spend some time with her. He was fine with giving her the silence treatment for no discernible reason. He was fine with being rude to her friends, flirting with waitresses, and he was fine with her being miserable. She had gone into the relationship thinking she would pick up Todd's broken pieces, sure, but in the end she only found herself holding more shards than she could carry. Some of them were even her own.

"I'm going to eat it," said Todd. His eyes glimmered with determination and as he displayed an extraterrestrial level of athleticism, leaping much higher than a poor seagull might expect from what it assumed to be a human, he locked his jaws around the poor bird. It let out a meek squawk of defeat.

"Don't eat it!" Eleanor begged. Instinctively, her body tightened. Years of experience had taught her that if you give Todd an order, you will soon come to regret it. But to her surprise, Todd unclenched his jaws and let the seagull fly off as feathers rained in front of them.

"Okay," said Todd.

An old woman held her husband tight as they walked past. The old man balled his fists and squinted at them with more than a trace of menace. To her surprise, Todd seemed frightened by the man's aggressive stance. He hid behind her and stared at the old couple with wide eyes. Eleanor rose to the challenge. "I'm the body snatcher!" she shrieked. "I love taking the bodies of senior citizens and turning them into TikTok dance sensations." The old couple walked faster and they both let out timid cries as she raced after them for a few moments.

"It's nice," said Todd.

"What?" Eleanor turned back to her body-snatching boyfriend who stared out at the sea with a look of awe.

"Watching the boats pass by. It's nice."

As they sat, head to head, on the dock bench, people passed them by without knowing what a strange pair they were. A man reading a newspaper stopped in front of them and said, "You kids better be careful. The body snatcher is on the loose."

"Okay," said Todd, and a feather flew out from his mouth. The man hesitated for a moment before he moved on, holding his newspaper tight.

"Let's head home. We'll pick up some pickles on the way."

Todd pumped his fists to celebrate. Eleanor followed suit.

They walked off hand in hand, two crazy people in a crazy world, as a seagull squealed at them from above.
