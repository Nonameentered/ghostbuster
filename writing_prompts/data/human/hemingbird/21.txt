**35th Encounter With the Deity Who Lives in the Glass Palace**

"*Spider* venom. Come on. Be reasonable."

"Venom. We have talked about this."

"Venom! Do you know how many different types of venom there are? There are spiders, scorpions, jellyfish, ants, vipers—you can't just lump them all together. That's not fair."

"Venom."

"Platypuses! Or platipi. Whatever they're called in plural. You can't have a category cohabited by spiders and platy-somethings."

"*Venom*."

"Ugh. Fine. Miraculously bring me back to life again then, whatever."

**62nd Encounter With the Deity Who Lives in the Glass Palace**

"I found a new one. At least I think I did? What do you call it, this death I just had?"

"Vacuum of Space."

"Is that right? It's not choking, radiation, or anything like that?"

"It's the Vacuum of Space."

"Alright. That's a fun one, right? I'm sure you slapped your knees before I got here."

"Do you wish to continue?"

"Well ... Let me think. My original plan, you know, was to just drift throughout space like some immortal being until some aliens picked me up and made me their god. That would be something new. A new experience. Then I died. I was shocked. Here I am, floating in space, not a single care in the world. The guys at the ISS banged on the glass, you know? I saw them screaming. Didn't hear it, but I saw it. I acted like I suddenly realized I'd become untethered and made a face of horror and I just waved at them while gaping. It was a riot. A riot in space. Then I *died*. Because you, in your impenetrable wisdom, decided that the Vacuum of Space is its own special little cause of death."

"... Do you wish to continue?"

"Sure. Give me another ride. Our conversation will be brilliant next time around, you best believe it."

**63rd Encounter With the Deity Who Lives in the Glass Palace**

"Now I think you're just messing with me."

"Platypodes. That was your idea."

"PlatyPODES? What are you smoking? I remember our little conversation. Platypuses. Platypi. Have your pick. But platypodes? That's a disgrace. And you call yourself the Deity Who Lives in the Glass Palace? Have you no decency?"

"Platypodes. Do you wish to continue?"

"I'm actually pretty grateful to you, I have to admit. The pain! The pain was unbearable. I kept eating their crural glands and it was all over a period of months because it's hard to get hold of the stuff, ethically, unless it's roadkill. Ever heard about hyperalgesia? Platypus venom hurts like hell, then it lowers your threshold for feeling pain! Everything hurt and opioids did nothing. The doctor, or I mean the guy in the back alley, he was stunned when he saw me chug the bottle. But that's our little secret. What was it, the 18th time?"

"Opioids was the 17th."

"Is that right? Man. But I have to tell you, I thought I was going to have to live with that pain forever. Like forever forever. Being close to immortal and all. But you sneaky SOB, you had it all planned out. It all worked out in the end. Platypuses."

"Platypodes."

"Oh, don't be like that. Don't be pedantic. Don't be podantic, heh. You know, immortality isn't all too bad with these Easter eggs you've been hiding."

"Hiding?"

"Yeah. Obscure causes of death. Vacuum of Space. Platypi. I like it."

"I am not hiding them. You are simply weeding them out one by one."

"Yeah, but that's what evolution is like as well, isn't it? I've heard it said that natural selection might as well be called non-random elimination. Was that your idea? Evolution? And thanks for not correcting me again, by the way."

"Evolution is a natural process. It was not invented in the Glass Palace."

"No one invented it? No prime mover or anything like that?"

"I did not say no one invented it. Evolution was invented by Phirley And."

"Phirley and who?"

"That is his name. Phirley And."

"... Abbott and Costello aren't the ultimate gods of this universe, right?"

"I have no knowledge of any guardian deities bearing those names."

"Whew! That's a relief. Let's go! I'll see if I can't find another one of those Easter eggs you've been hiding."

**64th Encounter With the Deity Who Lives in the Glass Palace**

"You monster. You demon. How could you do that to me?"

"Black Hole. Do you wish to continue?"

"Uh, NO. No, I don't wish to continue. I tried drifting around in space again because I thought Alien would be a really fun and cool way to die. But I didn't see a single alien! Not one! Is that the answer to the Fermi paradox? We're all alone? But what's up with you, then? How can there be deities but no aliens?"

"There are no sentient species on any planet in the Milky Way except on Earth."

"I *know*. I didn't see anything. Do you know how long it took me to drift towards the black hole at the center of this dead, boring galaxy? Because I don't. Because at some point, the concept of 'time' ceased to exist. It must have been a million years. At the very least."

"6 million years, approximately."

"Jesus Christ. How am I still able to think? How can I still talk?"

"Your neurons are immortal. Ever since—"

"Yeah yeah. The sixth time. I remember. I remember everything. That's what kills me. Well it doesn't. Because nothing does. Except, you know, BLACK HOLES. Jesus. You could at least have called it Spaghettification. Wouldn't that have been cooler?"

"You said that you do not wish to continue. I will now grant you True Death."

"Wait. Hold on. Just tell me: are Aliens still on the table? Like, if I make it out of the Milky Way? Might I run into some freaky extraterrestrials? And more importantly: do they count as a separate cause of death?"

"There are aliens."

"Holy ssssssss—alright then! That's something!"

"They do not count as a separate cause of death."

"... You've got to be kidding me."

"The only ones you would be physically able to interact with, at least, do not count."

"Huh? And why is that?"

"Encounter 47."

"Uhm. Which one was that again?"

"Crabs."

"... Crabs?"

"The only aliens you could hypothetically interact with are technically crabs. You are immortal to crabs."

"... Fine. Let's get it over with."

"I shall now grant you True Death."

"Okay, thanks."
