The sky was a lovely blue with small white puffs of cloud scattered as if by a prize-winning chef with his finishing touch of salt. Larks were singing, crows were coughing, and somewhere off in the distance I could hear the labored breathing of a fair maiden who had just at this moment, somehow, registered a newfound agony of my absence. I could picture her, sitting there. Twirling her hair. Singing la la la la—

"Hold on now—what's that thing?"

The toll inspector had a hamster of a mustache and he scratched it—petted it?—while staring in the general direction of my presence. On the wooden table lay my belongings. A stern-looking woman searched through them for contraband and items that might make my journey Too Much Fun; TMF. Getting caught with such items meant a ticket or worse, depending on the seriousness of the matter. A WTMF meant imprisonment.

It was with this fear in mind and in heart that I gulped in panic because I did have a flask of a little something something in a pouch, tied to my breeches. "W-What thing?"

"That thing you're holding. It's a boulder, isn't it? Let's see ... Yes: General Minerals. That's form 46C, section 19."

"Oh. Right. That. This is the Divine Sword."

Hamster-stache stopped for a second and he gave me a mean glare. He gestured at the woman and, as if on cue, she gave me a matching glare as well. There they were. Glaring at me. "Swords belong under General Weaponry. That's 12F."

"Section two," added the woman.

The man nodded. It was clear that these guys were professionals.

"I'm sorry," I said. "So I just fill out the form?"

"Well, the thing is ... There's a form for General Minerals and there's a form for General Weaponry. That's a sword stuck inside a boulder, isn't it? That counts as one item. That's the law. But the problem—"

"We don't have a form for that," said the woman.

The man demonstratively cleared his throat. "We don't have a form for that."

"Oh."

"Yeah."

"Can't I just fill out both?"

The toll inspector took a deep breath. "Well, I suppose that could be arranged. If you would just be so kind and pry the two of them apart ..."

"I can't."

"Why?"

"They're stuck together. It's the Divine Sword in the Divine Stone. Haven't you heard the legend? Well, actually it's a Holy Sword. But the boulder's still the Divine Stone. Some ancient wizard messed up, I guess." I shrugged. "But if I just fill out them both—"

"That's a felony."

"What?"

"Forging documents. We can't have any of that."

I tried to see if he were joking. I couldn't see any sign of it. Somewhere off into the distance, my fair maiden sighed.

"We're not forging anything, are we? Here's the sword, here's the rock. They're stuck together, sure, but they're separate items."

"Separate them, then."

"I can't."

"You won't."

"No. I *can't*.

The woman suddenly piped up. "I do remember hearing about a legend like that, actually."

Finally, some progress. "You hear that? I'm the strongest warrior in the kingdom, chosen by the Temple itself as its representative—well, the Templars not the building itself nor the abstract notion of the 'Temple'. The Templars chose me. Here I am."

She folded her arms and arched a brow. "According to what I heard, the strongest warrior of the realm would free the sword from the stone and prosperity and love and blessings of all sorts would be bestowed upon us all."

The man nodded. "I could do with some prosperity. Wouldn't mind no blessings either."

"That warrior would be the rightful owner of the sword. Do you get what I'm saying, Philbert?"

"Uh, I'm not sure I do, Clara."

"That man!" she said and she pointed at me very rudely. "He's carrying the sword but it's still stuck in the stone. What does that mean?"

Mr Stache laughed. "He's not as strong as he thinks he is."

"And he's not the sword's rightful owner," she added.

A crow passing by gasped.

"Now, wait a minute ... Didn't you hear what I said? Someone messed up. A wizard. He put the Holy Sword into the Divine Stone. It doesn't add up. No one can wrestle something Holy from something Divine. It doesn't make sense, does it?"

The toll inspector scratched his beard. "If it belongs to no one ..."

"It belongs to the State," the woman finished.

The man's eyes widened. "Oh! You're right. I was about to say that if it doesn't belong to anyone, then meh. Why don't he just take it and move on? But if it belongs to the State, and we're employees of said State ... That means ... Well ... Help me here, Clara."

Clara smacked the table with both hands. "That means we're going to have to confiscate your sword-in-the-stone, mister."

"Fine."

"R-Really? Just like that?"

I let go of the boulder and it thumped into the ground, blocking the toll road.

"Hey. Don't just put it there. Move it."

I shrugged. "It's not mine."

"Philbert, move it."

"Me? I can't lift that thing. It's a *boulder*."

"It's government property. Don't forget your sworn duty."

Philbert gave it a solid effort, but the boulder wouldn't budge. Travelers were lining up behind me, shouting complaints.

"Hey! What's the big idea? I've got a wedding to attend."

"A wedding? Well I'm meeting with the magistrate."

"You guys think those things are important? My cat is home, all alone, and I bet she's hungry!"

They shouted and shook their fists at the toll inspectors. "What's taking you so long?" asked Clara. "It's just a rock. Move it. They're getting impatient over here."

"Hnnnngh ... hnnnghggghg!"

"Philbert!"

"I ... caaaaan't ..."

"Do you want some help?" I asked. He nodded, shamefully.

They quickly arrived at the conclusion that a sword-in-a-stone was not explicitly listed as an item of importance on any of their forms and that this meant that as far as the State was concerned, it didn't exist.

I was about to go on my way when Philbert, wheezing, pointed at my hip. "Hold on now—what's that thing?"

A mean scowl spread across Clara's face. "It appears to be a flask ... It wouldn't happen to be a TMF, would it?"

I smiled. "This is the Divine Flask. Inside, you will find the Holy Water. Is there a form I need to fill?"

"Oh," said the woman. "Well ..."

"For the love of god," said Philbert.

The woman scratched her head. "I suppose that, uh, well I suppose it's fine."

"I can go?"

"Yeah. Just go. Move along sir. People are waiting."

I waited until the toll inspectors were out of sight and I uncorked the bottle and took a decent swig. Ah. That was the stuff.

Somewhere, out there, my fair maiden nervously awaited the arrival of the strongest warrior of the kingdom.
