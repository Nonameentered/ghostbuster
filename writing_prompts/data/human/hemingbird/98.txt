I was in that state of mind where you want to jump off a bridge, but your dog needs you so you can't, when I applied for a job at the local police station.

Crawnlough is a small town, and when I fantasized about my own undoing it occurred to me that either Steve, Mary-Ann, or Dakota Philip would have to deal with its consequences. I felt bad. Our three-cop town didn't see much in the ways of tragedy, as far as I was aware, but that trio had to deal with all of it. They were probably tired. So I figured I might help them out and Flaky, my Jack Russell Terrier, arf'ed with encouragement, so I decided the matter was settled and two weeks later I received a letter in the post.

Little did I know that a mysterious gang known only to the officers as the Vicodin boys were supplying Crawnloughers with illicit pain-relieving, boredom-disrupting, highly-addictive substances and that they had been racking their three brains trying to figure out how to take them down. The problem: Steve, Mary-Ann, and Dakota Philip were a quinquagenarian bunch and there was not a chance in the world any of them would be able to infiltrate the Vicodin boys. Then I came along.

It wasn't really a job. It was more like an assignment more-commonly given to people busted for low-level crimes in return for having their charges reduced or dropped altogether.

"You'd be really doing us a solid," Steve said when I came down for an interview. "We've just been overwhelmed, really. You see the people out there? The people all walking around like zombies?" He opened a window and stared out at the empty Crawnlough street, looking around for a while, then said, "Usually, there's people out there. And they're all spaced out. There's not any right now, but you can imagine."

"I can imagine," I said, and this seemed to make Steve pleased.

Mary-Ann brought me a cup of hot chocolate and said 'hun' a lot. "Look at you, hun. You really know how to fill out a résumé, hun. Can I get you anything, hun, we have all sorts of snacks down here so just say the word."

Something in their eyes told me that I had become a symbol of hope already, and I thought that wasn't too bad for a first day of work. Dakota Philip walked up mid-interview and grabbed a chair, spun it around, and sat down the wrong way. "You think you're pretty hip, dontcha? Well, I have to tell ya: these Vicodin boys have an impeccable sense of style. That's the word on the street. If you want to fit in, you're gonna have to look fly AF. On fleek. You really think you have what it takes?"

Steve and Mary-Ann stared at Dakota Philip with what appeared to be awe. Not only did he have an interesting name, he also knew how to converse with young people. At least he thought he did, and Steve and Mary-Ann seemed to think so too. They looked over at me, with nervous looks, and I cleared my throat before saying, "I guess?"

Dakota Philip slipped me a bottle of maze before I left the station, smirking. "You know what's popping," he said, but I didn't really.

Back home I told Flaky that I'd become an undercover agent. He didn't seem all that impressed.

At first I didn't really know how I'd even find the Vicodin boys. My now-colleagues had barely made any progress whatsoever in months. Following a hunch, I headed down to the local Bingo hall, thinking I'd ask around. I donned what I thought might pass as fashionable. Not trying too hard, but not looking like I'm trying not to look like I'm trying too hard neither. It was a precarious balance, yet I felt like I'd sort of nailed it. Walking in, I was overcome by the smell of urine and ointments. There were about a dozen old people, in various states of decay, and two guys in baggy jeans sitting all the way at the back. I sat down next to them.

"You selling?" I asked the one closest to me. Most of the color had disappeared from his Tupac tee but the neon-green of his Monster Energy cap more than made up for it.

"Who's asking?" he said.

"A gal with a bad knee," I said.

Mr Neon nodded his head and looked over at his friend as if to confirm. The friend, in a Shrek 2 tee, shrugged his shoulders. Mr Shrek 2 seemed more interested in the bingo than in dealing. He looked up at the organizer spinning the bingo machine and down at his cards repeatedly, breathing heavily, and I could see he was only an 'I' away from victory. "Sure, we can hook you up," said Mr Neon.

We met later, in the parking lot, and Mr Shrek 2, fresh off the high of a win, offered me a job. "We don't really know these people," he said. "They don't trust us. You look, uh, you look like you might get along with them." I had never been so insulted in my life. But they weren't wrong. I got along great with old people.

Soon, I became an integral part of their operation. I told my colleagues down at the station what I'd learned, but they told me to go along with it for a while. They wanted a big bust. Something big enough to take them down for good. Dakota Philip put his hand on my shoulder and told me, "Hang in there, 'cus it's gonna be *lit*." He could never have expected how true his words would turn out to be.
