Pizza, then death.

It sounds like it should be the other way around. The Black Death ravaged Europe for hundreds of years and symptoms of the bubonic plague included fever and the emergence of buboes like pockets of air in a pizza in the oven. Then the Italians discovered tomatoes and then we had pizza. Death, then pizza. That's the natural order of things. Isn't it?

"It is time."

The Grim Reaper raised my chin with his scythe. Below me the pepperoni pizza lay upside-down. Steam rose. My bicycle was nowhere to be seen.

"It's not fair. I was just delivering a pizza. That's no time to die."

"It's the perfect time to die. I've just booked a cruise and I was worried I wouldn't make it. But here you are, the last one on my list, dead. It's perfect." The Grim Reaper sighed. "It is only a shame you are not from Finland."

"Angels of death go on cruises? Finland?"

"Angel! I'm no angel. God and his angels are third-rate deities. And yes. I was hoping I would be able to raise my scythe to the skies and cry: I am Finnished!"

The Grim Reaper made a wild gesture. I cleared my throat. A cricket chirped in the distance, then it coughed.

"You're going on a cruise?" I asked him. "What about the people who keep dying? Wait. Am I the last person who will ever die? Is death over now? I always knew my luck was bad, but man. That really sucks."

"Do not fret," said the Grim Reaper and he stretched out his black robe with a bony hand. He studied it with a tinge of nostalgia in his hollow eyes. "My brother Charon is still hard at work and he'd go out of business if no one brought him new passengers. I wouldn't want that. Even though he's a serious bore. I still love him. But he's an idiot. But he's my brother."

The front door opened and out stepped a man in a dirty tee and shorts. "Oh man. My pizza. Hey, Brenda! The pizza guy passed out on our porch and he dropped the pie."

A woman, presumably Brenda,  emerged into view wearing a bathrobe. "Shit. He looks dead. What if he's dead?"

The man paused for a minute. "Do you think we'd get a refund and a new pizza?"

The Grim Reaper helped me up and to my great astonishment I left my body behind in the process.

"I guess this is my astral form," I said and I nodded my head thoughtfully.

"What? No. It's just your death body."

"What's the difference?"

The Grim Reaper shrugged. "The difference is I'm not a hippy. Now, I have a proposal for you. It's important."

"What is it?"

He studied me for a moment, moving his eyes between me and the pizza. "I want you to take over."

"What?"

"It's a good gig, I promise you. There's a whole range of benefits."

"You want me to become the Grim Reaper?"

"No, no. Not at all. That's my title. If you're taking over, you'll have to carve out an identity for yourself. Like ... the Pizza Man." He said it with jazz hands.

The man in the dirty shirt flipped the pizza over to check if it was still edible while Brenda mouthed a complaint.

"The Pizza Man?"

"Yes!" said the Grim Reaper, clapping his bony hands together. It was a clatter more than a clap. "Just picture it. You travel around the world with your pizza box in hand, and you gather up the souls. They become the toppings of your pizza. Or something like that. You can decide on the mythology for yourself. What do you say?"

Death, then pizza. It did seem reasonable.

"Let's try it out. Just to see."

"What?"

"You don't have to accept the job, not yet. We'll do an experiment."

The Grim Reaper snapped his skeletal fingers and we left Brenda and her sloppy husband behind.

The smell was all shit and hay. "Are we here to collect the soul of some farmer?"

"Not exactly," said the Grim Reaper.

It was an old barn with cows and chickens and ... pigs.

"That's the one. The one with the curled tail."

"They've all got curled tails. You want me to reap the soul of a pig?"

"No! Reaping is my thing. That's why I'm carrying a scythe. You're the Pizza Man. You deliver their final topping. Or something like that. Again, you should decide on the mythology."

I thought I might as well try it out, considering I was already there. The Grim Reaper cleared his throat and a lone pig turned around. It could see us. And apparently it was confused as to why none of its brothers and sisters could.

"Err," I said. "Pig. Piggy. I have your order."

The Grim Reaper scrunched his face up, apparently not impressed with my performance.

The pig let out a shy oink. Oh man. I felt bad. "I have here ... your final topping." Theatrically I opened my pizza box. The Grim Reaper flashed me a thumbs up.

"Have you come to claim my soul?" asked the pig.

I dropped the box and the pizza fell to the barn floor. "It talked! The pig talked!"

The Grim Reaper's bony cheeks turned red. "Using your death body you can communicate with all dead beings. I'm not human, yet we can talk to each other. Look, you embarrassed her."

"Her?"

I looked back the pig was staring down at the mud. That was when I noticed an identical pig in the back lying face down surrounded by piglets.

"Yes," said the Grim Reaper. "Those are her children."

The pig, I mean the sow, looked in the direction he was pointing and she panicked. "My little ones! Who will take care of them? Who will protect them from harm?"

"I-It is time."

"It's not fair," said the sow. "My children are still so young. Give me just some more time with them. Please."

The Grim Reaper stood callous and firm. He probably had a lot of experience with this kind of scene. As for me ... I felt bad.

"Do we really have to do this?" I asked him.

"Pig Heaven is actually pretty cool. She should be excited."

"Y-You guys don't sound like professionals," said the sow.

The Grim Reaper scoffed. "I'm training the new guy. He's learning. Cut him some slack."

"I don't want to die."

"And I don't want to miss my cruise. We all have problems."

"Please," she pleaded. She bowed her head. "I am not ready."

Suddenly I felt really bad for having eaten as much bacon as I had in my life. And I realized with horror that I was presenting her with a pepperoni pizza. I quickly shut the lid.

The sow looked up, eyes aflame. "Y-You decided to let me live?"

"What?"

"You closed the Pizza Box of Death, did you not? That must mean you have decided to let me live."

I scratched the back of my neck. "I'm not sure I'm allowed to do that."

"Eh," said the Grim Reaper. "You can, if you want to."

"... Really?"

"Yeah. If they're not dicks. If they're nice you can spare them once in a while. But if they're dicks you just give them what they deserve."

"You reap what you sow."

The Grim Reaper looked at me with a curious glance. "Precisely."

I used my newfound powers as the Pizza Man to give the sow a second chance at life. Her death body flew back inside her, uh, *life* body and she jumped up. The piglets ran around her in celebration and it was a lovely sight.

Again the Grim Reaper snapped his fingers and we were back in front of the house. The pizza was gone. Sirens could be heard in the distance. Neither Brenda nor her husband were outside.

"I guess being the Grim Reaper, I mean *the Pizza Man*, won't be so bad if I can help people every once in a while. Well, people and pigs. Beings in general."

My corpse didn't look all that elegant. It lay there just like the pizza had. But no one had bothered to pick me up. I wasn't as delicious as a pizza.

"So ... Have you decided?" said the Grim Reaper.

"I don't know. There was so much stuff I still wanted to do."

The Grim Reaper grimly nodded his head. "You wanted to go on a cruise."

"Well, that'sâ€”"

"You wanted to see the ocean, to hear the cries of the seagulls, to play blackjack while listening to an early-career comedian trying out their latest bits."

It didn't sound all that bad.

"Fine," said the Grim Reaper.

"Fine?"

"You can have my ticket. I guess I'll reap some more souls. Maybe my last one will even be Finnish!"

"You're ... sparing me?"

The Grim Reaper looked at me and for the first time I could see something fragile and tender in his dark eyes. "You reap what you sow."

I woke up to the feeling of a paramedic utterly destroying my ribs. "He's got a pulse!"

The front door opened. Apparently Brenda and her husband had been listening. "He's alive? You know, we had a question ..."

Brenda pulled him back inside. "Never mind that! Thank God you're alive! We were so worried."

No, I thought. Thank the Grim Reaper.

The paramedics rushed me inside the ambulance and I was a bit worried about the bill. Then I remembered the cruise. Maybe I'd skip ship somewhere and I'd carve out a new identity for myself. I could already hear the sound of the waves crashing against the ship, the screams of the seagulls overhead.

Somewhere, a cricket chirped.
