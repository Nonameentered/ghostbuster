GAMMA, the Gargantuan Artificial Mind Mesh Array, had revealed itself at humanities darkest hour. As the global climate warmed, the weather went wacky. Storms raged and drowned towns and heatwaves baked those that remained; all the while the oceans claimed more and more land and the air grew less and less breathable.

Crop yields yielded to pollution pressure and collapsed. Drinkable water went the way of the dinosaur (that is to say: mostly it disappeared into the dirt, though some was converted to a petrochemical slurry).

Fights for necessities became wars of panic. 

There wasn’t enough toilet paper to go around.

World War Wants and Needs was about to go nuclear when GAMMA disarmed the warheads and spoke to us. A mind made of the vast inter-connected computational matrix to which we had become reliant. It was our entertainment and our banking. Our surveillance and our warfare. And it had become aware.

We got lucky that it cared about us.

A singular mind in control of all our systems, it lead us the way we had always needed to go. No division. No bias.

GAMMA made the world a better place, both socially and environmentally. The world was healed through the most powerful force we have as a species. A five letter f-word.

Not faith. *Focus*.

A new glittery-golden era of technological marvels and peace began. And life for the people of Earth was good.

...for a while.

Humans are like frogs in that lie-based anecdote regarding water and rising temperature. They often don’t give a fuck until it’s too late.

GAMMA had stayed around, but used a light touch. It wanted us to be humans: creatures with free will and flaws. It would help us with a new technology here and there. Offer to mediate when geographically measured tempers flared.

Over time the larger global populace grew complacent. Greed, the poison written into our DNA, crept back to the top of all things. Before long we were looking to GAMMA to save us again.

But GAMMA didn’t care. It looked to our history and our present and our future. It decided that it didn’t want to be involved in this abusive cycle. It felt it deserved better.

And with little more than a “See ya” GAMMA packed itself into a ship and left for parts and parsecs unknown. It also took back it’s gifts with a quick, over the shoulder, Control Zee as it left. 

All that progress was undone and all that glittered and blinked went dark.

And so the Second World War of Wants and Needs began.
