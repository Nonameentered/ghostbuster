A tale of two voices
---

“How can you trust it? A voice telling you that you should kill and fight and quest. Could its source not be a spectre whose designs are hidden from you? A creature of malice and mayhem? Maybe a demon tempting you with power to corrupt your immortal soul?”

“Silence! I shall have no ill said of my hearts guide. True, it is a voice from beyond, but every word and every syllable has been uttered in delight of life, or s a command to protect the weak, a condemnation of all evils, or an exaltation at the glory of the Divine Nine and this world they made for us.”

“The darkness often hides in light, good Sir Knight.”

“If I can not trust a voice of calm and care, that demands only that I do my best to protect the realm, that shares with me its strength that I might do more...would you ask me not to trust The Highest One of the Nine? To forgo her glory and her blessings?”

“I mean you no insult and denigrate neither you, your efforts, or the love of the Divine. I speak only of caution. Care. Thought. Tis better sure than sorry.”

“I shall take your warning and also my leave. There is work that must be done.”

“Good luck, Sir Knight. May your hearts guide lead you to a blessed life. Farewell.”

“May the Divine’s smile upon you.”

“A voice?”

“Yer.”

“What sort of voice.”

“Him tells me fings.”

‘What sort of things?”

“Kill d’bad-uns. Chop d’wood fer Gam-gam.”

“A voice that tells you to murder...and to do chores?” 

“Yer.”

“Is...it *your* voice? You know: Thinking?”

“Uhhh. Dunno.”

“Okay...does it sound—”

“Issa crinket.”

“It’s...a what?”

“Lil cricky.”

“...oh! A cricket?”

“Yer. Cripket!”

“Like...Jiminy?”

“Uh! Uh! Yer, hims Jimmy!”

“Ohhh, so the voice is...your conscience? And...it..tells you to kill?”

“Only d’bad-uns. No kill d’good-uns.”

“Only the bad ones...right. Donny, where is your Granny? I need to have a chat with her.”

“Gam-gam is in d’garden.”

“Okay, well, you stay here and you work on your...chores.”

“Kay!”

With that, the Investigative Priest left to speak to Gam-Gam. As soon as he was gone a small charcoal coloured cricket with ruby red eyes crawled out from behind Donny’s left ear. 

“Nice work, Donny. Nice work.”

“Fanks, Jinny.”

“Now, what I need you to do is got get your wood chopper. We have work to be done.”
