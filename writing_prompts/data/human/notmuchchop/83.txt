“Well done!” Said the Sage from Melissa’s left hand. The girl held the severed piece in a tight grip. The Sage continued: “Now then: take me over to yonder rosemary. You’ll be needing some of that, too.”

“Does...does it talk as well?”

“Oh, heavens no.”

“Oh...oh good. One talking herb was-”

“She took a vow of silence years ago.”

Melissa gulped. Had she gone mad? Yes. Evidently so. Or this was one of those head trauma dreams. It would make sense.

Nana’s hidden herb garden was tucked away in the woods. *Maybe,* thought the teen, *I tripped on a rock, or fell off a cliff, or...maybe a bear got me. Either way this isn’t happening. This. Can’t be happening, right?*

The other side of the garden was now before her and the once yonder Rosemary was now a great deal more hither. Melissa blinked. She had been lost in thought, but her legs had stayed on target.

“Um. Ummm.”

“Hello, Rosemary dear, how’s things?” Said Sage. “Got a fresh one here, needs a hand. Mavis’ daughter’s girl. Not Patty. Rebecca. Remember Bec? The wee one? Well, this is Melissa, *her* daughter. Seems she’s to be the new garden Witch.”

“The new what!?” Said Melissa in a rather loud, screamy, and unwitch-like manner. She’d figure it out, Sage knew.
