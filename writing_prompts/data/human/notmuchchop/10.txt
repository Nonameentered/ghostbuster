“You was always a ‘appy baby, you was.”

“Shh.” I fluffed her pillow and gave her a small smooch on her grey-fringed forehead. “Try and rest up. Big day tomorrow.”

“When you was born, you—” Of course, she’d ignore me. “You dint cry. Not e’en a little whimper! You came out and you was laughin’, you was.”

“Really? Doesn’t sound like me.” I was sat on the edge of the hospital bed, careful not to sit on any of her many tubes and wires. Medicine was in a fight with her frailty...and it was losing. I held her hand in mine. Who knew how many more moments we had. Time flew by and my wonder woman mother had somehow...gotten old.

“You was gigglin’ and guffawin’, you was. Like a musketeer. Mangey-lilac...many-ally. Many—oh ‘eck! Was the word?”

“Maniacally?”

“*Man-eye-ack-lee*! Thaz the one.” She leaned her head back, closed her eyes and smiled. “My lil laughy bub-bub. Cute as a bug.”

I chuckled. “All babies are cute.”

“Nah they ain’t.” She opened one eye and smiled wider. As she spoke her voice grew quieter. More tired. “You was...was proper cute. Mm.”

I held her hand and waited for her to drift off to sleep. Only sleep. Still life in the old girl yet.

“Cute. E’en with ya lil ‘orns.”

I chuckled and wondered where her sleepy mind was headed.

“And the wings. ‘ooves, too.”

What was she on about?

“Yer lil tail I liked. Lil pointy fing.”

“Wonder what show you got that from.” I had whispered without thinking and was startled when she stirred and fixed me with a stare.

A stern and present stare, not one lost in the fog of medicine or tainted by nostalgia, age, or illness. “You looked like ya pa when you was born.”

“What?”

“Then he did a little spell and made ya all...normal.” She shook her head at the word normal. “Shame you couldn’t be yerself. If ya pa was about he coulda shown you how to be...well...*you*. The real you.”

She had lost lucidity before. Been confused. Thought for a moment that the events on the mid-day soap operas were her life. But now...her eyes. 

That stare.

Clarity.

“Shoulda said sooner...I shoulda.” She lay her head back, though did not close her eyes. “Yer Pa said it’d be best to keep it ‘ush and buried. Till ‘e was back, y’see.”

“Mum, I’m going to get the doctor, okay?”

She grabbed my hand and held with a grip I didn’t think she could muster anymore. “Yer Pa. ‘e’ll come when I go. ‘e’ll Teach ya what you is.”

“Mum, I think you’re conf—”

“I ain’ted *confused*. I feel ‘im. It’ll be good to see ‘im, it will. I’m still ‘is. Always was. Always will be.”

She laid her head back, her face calm and creased with an easy smile. Her grip loosened.

“I love you.” She said in a weak breath.

“Mum?”

“She was always a warm woman.” Said a voice behind me.

I turned and saw a slightly older version of myself, suit-clad and grey at the temples, dark sunglasses on indoors and at night. His posture suggested a certain carelessness, and yet his eyebrows were furroughed and a tear ran down his cheek.

A tear that steamed and boiled away.
