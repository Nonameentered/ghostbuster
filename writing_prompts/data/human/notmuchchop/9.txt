All in all, the plan went fairly smoothly...as smoothly as a bloody global coup can go, at least. Can’t deny that there was loss of land, life, and liberties. You know what they say about eggs and omelettes and the need to use brutal warfare to seize control and make a peaceful utopia. Just how things need to go, you know?

The lands lost were taken from nations *for* the people.

The people lost were necessary sacrifices to the foundation of the new World Nation.

The so called “liberties” that were lost were actually poisons that robbed our peoples and our World Nation of direction. Better to be fed and warm and content whilst on a leash than living wild, hungry and diseased, waiting for a sad and inevitable death.

See! I can spin it. I *did* spin it.

Many have joined our efforts of unification in joyous song. Some have stiffly acquiesced...and others — small factions — are enemies of our nation who will be stomped out and hung in the streets to be beaten to death. 

Smooth sailing.

Save, maybe, for one teensy, tiny, little catch. One tiny itty-bitty grain of sand that adds only the most minuscule dot of roughness to the silky smooth operation of the Psy-Op Government Propaganda machine that I have carefully devised. Our dear leader — the genius architect of our utopia, the fist that fought the false leaders and their lies — he...well. He has an idea that he clings to, one that is brilliant in its own way, but one that I believe can be improved upon.

He wants to be called...something other than what we chose. We avoided King and Emperor, and never considered Supreme Leader. He, for now, is Prime Generalissimo de Excellence. 

But...

He *wants* to be called: The Great Shadow Lord...

Of Dread and Tears...

Harbinger of the Age of Darkness.

Regent — Yes, still going — of the Night and Godking of the Damned and Wicked and...

It goes on a bit more (a page and a half), but you get the gist. It’s very...*gothic*. Paints a macabre air about him and, for me, as someone who views him as the light of our world...I just don’t think his desired title quite matches with who and what he is and how he should be seen and spoken about. 

It’s a *lovely* title — well crafted, really — just...you know. Not quite the tone that I think best fits him.

Anyway. I have a meeting with him shortly and I know he will make the best decision.

It is important to note that good liars will even lie to themselves. If you live in a fascist world, you best act, work as, and *think* like a fascist. Otherwise...you slip up. You become the enemy.

So, our wonderful leader is right to want that name. And he’ll be even more right to keep the one he has. He’ll know what to do.

I really hope he’ll do the smart thing, even though everything he does is smart. I can spin just about anything, but a page and a half of moody teen titles...hoo boy.
