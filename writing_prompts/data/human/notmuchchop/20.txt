“Do we know what happened?”

“We have an idea. The transporter managed to get us some preliminary scans of the destination universe. Wasn’t great.”

“Well...the pilot died, so I figured that much out. Do we know *why* it went pear-shaped?”

“Hubris.”

“Are you going to give me the details or just waste my time?”

“He went and sent himself to a known volatile layer of possibilities, places where the fundamental laws of physics are different to our own. According to what we got from the Transporter before the containment failed...he ended up in a universe where the weak nuclear force was a great deal weaker.”

“So...no chance of recovery?”

“None. He ain’t coming back and we’d be lucky to get a quark let alone a screw from our equipment. Whole thing would have dissipated like ice in a hot tub.”

“Shame.”

“Yeah Inter-D Transporters don’t grow on trees. I keep telling these cowboys—”

“*Also*...”

“Hm?”

“Also a man died.”

“Well...those I can get for a heck of a lot cheaper than a new Inter-D.”

“You’re a giant ass.”

“You are what you e—”

“Stop it. Actually, wait...if the weak nuclear force is weaker, is there a chance—”

“That our friend is still alive but made of atoms that are much roomier?”

“Y—”

“No. Absolutely not. The readings indicated weakness enough for atomic structure to fall apart. That universe is a mist of subatomic particles. You don’t have laws of physics that lax and make anything as massive as a proton let alone an atom. No. No chance. He dead. Just more static on a dead channel.”
