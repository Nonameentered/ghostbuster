“Excuse me, Lady Lavender.” Said a calm voice from the air above and behind her.

Lady Lavender kept her eyes locked on the bald goon in a domino mask. She held him above her by his collar, despite being half his size.

The henchman’s face was wet with sweat, he didn’t dare to move too much, but looked up at the figure that had addressed Lady Lavender.

“I, I think, she — ah — was, well, talking to-to-to—”

“She was talking to me, yes, Barry. I *know*. But *I* asked *you* a question.”

“Lavender.”

“I’m *working*, Miss Midnight. Where is the hide-out, Barry?”

“Lavender.”

“What!?” Lavender dropped the Goon, who toppled and stayed put — he wasn’t dumb enough to try and run. She turned and looked up at the black clad figure that was hanging in the air of the alleyway. “What do you want.”

“I thought we said *I* get the Doctor Hypnopotamus cases.”

Lady Lavender, a short woman with purple everything threw her hands in the air. “Are you *kidding* me? No! Why would *you* get a villain that works on *my* part of town?”

“We wrote all this down for a re—”

“Oh don’t you play it all cool and calm in front of the goon, Midnight! You were having a hissy fit—”

“Hissy fit!?” Midnight landed and it shook the ground around them. “I do *not* have hissy fits, like a child. You’re the one who—”

“Oh, so *I’m* the tantrum thrower then, right? Always projecting, aren’t you!”

“My villain! *My* goon!” Midnight stepped passed Lavender, pointed a finger at Barry “Where is Dr Hypnopot—” 

“Eck-fucking-*scuse* you, bitch. *My* part of town. *My* goon.”

At the drop of the B-word, Midnight had turned, put her gloved hands on her black-leotarded hips and fixed Lavender with a wide-eyed, Domino-masked stare. “Bitch. *Me*? The bitch here?”

Lavender leaned in. “Hhhhye-puh!”

The black clad super wiped a glob of spit off her cheek. Her ex had officially crossed the fucking line.
