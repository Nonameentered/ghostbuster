As my father tells it...

The local crone knew I was Aether-touched when I was but a few months in my Mother’s womb.

The old witch arrived in the dead of a mid-winter night — barefoot, but bodily clad in a gown of black rags. The skin of her face, arms, legs, hands and feet were cluttered with sigils and geometries painted in a mixture of blood and soot. Her eyes were concealed by a veil of dark lace that held in it’s knots the singed bones of a raven.

My father says she knocked once and once only.

Our small home had almost toppled and he had run to the door and stopped. He knew without knowing that beyond was the crone. The axe he had snatched up in defense of his house and wife was rested away from the door — lest she get the wrong idea — and after a brief breath he opened the door with the best smile he could muster.

One does not scowl, no matter the hour, at a Witch.

She stood as a statue, unfazed by the winter gusts, and spoke in a whispered monotone that filled the shack and nearly rendered him unconscious.

“The seed you’ve sown, 
the life that grows, 
is one of Aether’s own.”

And with that, she left.

My mother, a practical woman, who was not as superstitious as my father and had not been so thoroughly...culturally indoctrinated?

...*stupid*. She wasn’t as stupid as Dad. She tells the story quite differently. 

It was winter and cold when Nana Nitsy came by, but night had only just defeated the day. My mother and father were sat by the fire to feel her growing belly and talk of the many things the future would bring.

And then the door rattled under a flurry of blows and cussing about cold winds, old bones, and why haven’t you opened this damn-ed door Jeremiah Filkson!

My father rushed to let the Old Witch in and my Mother filled a cup of tea for her Great Aunt Nitsy.

Nana Nitsy, as I came to know her, had figured there would be a good chance I would be of the Aether-touched. A magic user. It is, after all, in the family blood. It had skipped my Mother, as it sometimes does...but that night Nanny had been sitting at home, reading a book and tending a malformed crow-chick when a wall of Aether had knocked her rocking chair (and thus her) straight over.

Almost into the fire at her back.

The chair survived after having a teapot poured on it and she herself had gotten a bit sooty in the process of slapping and stomping out the embers of her less flame retardant book and dressing gown.

By the direction it had come from, the colour of its form, and the message at its core; Nana had deduced the source.

“Whatever you bloody-well ate for your supper: the bub was not a fan!”

My father had bowed his head and averted his eyes when Nitsy had stormed past him, and when the old witch asked what “that” was for, he realised he had his axe in his hands and had gripped it tightly to his chest. He dropped the chopper immediately. 

When he went to apologise he was stopped. A small black beak had poked out from the grey-black hair at her shoulder.

The beak had then said: corr.

After that he was fairly quiet for the rest of the night.

Nanny and Mum talked about what had happened and how the pregnancy was going. Dad didn’t notice (or rather couldn’t comprehend) that they were talking in codes. There were lots of references to a Mildred — whose name was always given after a brief pause and in that certain air that suggested deference, respect...and a deep and quiet fear.

“That lil one is going to be something special, Jess.”

“Of course.” Said Mum, hand on her belly and a smile on her face. “Aether or not, she’ll be the most important baby in my world.”

Nanny Nitsy looked to the adult male who was stood not far away: pale as a ghost, hands in his pockets, feet shuffling in the dust. 

Poor big baby.

I shall not bore you further with my early origins. I did have a few more pre-natal pre-magical misgivings, but nothing too major.

When my mother had taken me to the city at age three, so as to be Sighted by The Council, they wondered how they hadn’t sensed me until the ceremony. Then they learned of my lineage and who the local Forest Crone was.

“Ah.” said The Councilhead “That’d do it. Protection and concealment were always her strength. We’ll best keep an eye on this young lady. Coochie-Choochie-”

“Corr.”

“Uh? Is that a bird in her shirt?”

At age seven I was apprenticed to Nanny Nitsy. (Officially, anyway. I had been watching, wide-eyed and interested as soon as I could move my head of my own accord). Then, on my tenth summer I was sent to the Academy at Leadgate.

A few years passed and...

Now there’s this predicament.

\*  *  *

Aether. The form and fuel of magic. 

A veil that lets us draw energy from other planes of existence in order to bend this world to our will.

Few can do so. And for those that can: most rely on magical focuses, rituals, spells, potions...and sacrifice. Of those that can tap into this power, very few can see it in it’s true and raw form — instead they know only it’s feel and the view of it’s outcomes. 

They see the flame, but not the candle, and must endure the wax that rolls down their arm without knowing what it is.

I can see the Aether.

It takes many forms. And because I can wield it — without need of wand or incantation — it gathers around me. Pools. Aether wants to be used. The worlds beyond search always for a gate.

With focus and training, I have learned to peer *into* the Aether. I have learned that what once we called Auras...are spectres. Ghosts. 

Demons.

They cling and nestle in the Aether that we magic users gather. It is comfort, not sustenance to them. A promise of potential. They do not seem conscious of us as individuals.

Mostly.

I had stared long and hard into the Aether as part of my academic exploration into magic as a University Researcher...when...

She spoke.

A pair of eyes from beyond the veil met mine and they opened wide, curved at the movement of an unseen smile...and she spoke.

“That which has been seen, sees you, *girl*.”

My Aether was most often black and speckled, a facsimile of the night sky. Now it gathered into a boiling, churning, crimson filled with eyes. 

And then she was before me. An eight foot tall, slender silhouette of blood and irises. A shade. A *hint* of some being from beyond that was using my focus to...

“So much worry. So much *fear*. No need, girl. No need.”

I stood, frozen. She placed a hand on my shoulder and walked about my form, inspecting me as one would inspect a mare. 

“Such a *tiny* thing.” Said the Aether Cloaked beast. “I could make you bigger, you know. Stronger.”

“Who are you?”

She was behind me. She draped her red arms loosely over my shoulders and placed her chin atop my head. “Well. Given your stature, the drive in your heart, the thirst in your head, and the Aether in your blood...I could guess. *But*...I suppose I could make myself certain.”

Still behind me, she lifted a long hand to my face and reached into and through my forehead with a finger. Into my mind. There was a pain like fire behind my eyes, like a million red-hot needles had been shoved beneath the fingernails of my consciousness. Thoughts and memories were whisked by in the torrent of pain.

“Ah.” The pain stopped the moment she withdrew the finger from my forehead. “Nitsy taught you. Then, you would know me...as Mildred. An ancestor. And a very good friend to have.”
