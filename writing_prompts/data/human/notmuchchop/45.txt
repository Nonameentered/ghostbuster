Adrian steepled his hands — the tips of his fingers touched their opposite counterparts, his palms were apart, and atop this grabby pyramid, playing the part of an all seeing eye, was the greasy tip of his nose. A knowing eyebrow raise was matched with a lop-sided Cheshire grin.

“David, David, David.” Adrian said as he spread his hands. “Luck? Luck is what the unprepared blame when they fail. What I have...is skill.”

David looked at the boardgame on the table between them. Coloured snakes slithered among ladders on a grid. In *his* hands he held a beer and his phone. According to the chat, the others were almost there. For now, though, David and Adrian had about another twenty minutes to burn. 

David wasn’t sure why Adrian was doing a bad impression of an emotionally distant 90’s anime dad, all he knew was he wanted the smugness to stop.

“You see, David. I have plans. Contingencies. Why, the game I am playing is so far beyond your-”

“You have loaded die, don’t you.”

“...no.”

“Then why did you just snatch them up?”

“The time for snakes and ladders has ended. Let us play-”

“I’m not playing yahtzee with a guy with loaded die.”

“...craps?”

“No.”

“Ffffine.”
