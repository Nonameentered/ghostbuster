“Mr Deliver! Rain, hail, or shine: Your package delivered, intact and on time.”

The voice crackled from a speaker in the robots jaw as it sped down the highway. It dodged the bigger cracks and potholes, the tufts of grass, and the burned out cars. It was a domestic delivery drone. When new, Mr Deliver was a bright white and secure cube, with flush hidden doors, postal insignia, side-walk ready tires...and the upper half of a blue-uniformed postal worker sticking out the front. Once it had seemed a fellow from the lands of the Uncanny Valley — a face far too symmetrical, with untextured-skin, and movement enough to unsettle but not instil a sense of life.

Now? Now the whole thing was much more dilapidated. A world war and the end of days will do that. The bright white was gone, with grey-brown muck and red-brown rust in its stead. The doors were made of chicken wire, the tires built for off-roading. The human-esque front still wore the blue hat, but the rest of the uniform and the eerily pure skin was long gone. As was one of the arms.

Mr Deliver now lived as a sort of post-apocalyptic techno-centaur: where the back half is Mad Max’s golf cart and the front half is a discarded, near-dismantled animatronic mailman...one made of bare steel, exposed wiring, and sparks.

“Rain, hail, or shuh-shuh-shuh-shuh-” The voice gave way to a shrill squeak, a crackle, and then...silence. Mr Deliver’s electric motors pushed on.

The highway would take the drone into a city once called Delivery Sector FB Two One Twelve. The signs said something city, but that was people nonsense. All he knew was that the forwarding address he had found on the other coast had pointed to this Delivery Sector.

He’d just need to access the local system directory, find the forward address, and from there he could do his job and deliver. And then he could stop. One last package and then he could enjoy a nice long break and...and...

Anyways, in his central cube — his Package Core — there was one last box. A shoe box. He often wondered what wonders t held. Letters? A teddy? Hopefully nothing perishable, like a puppy.

Currently, Mr Delivers guess was a feather boa.

Likely it was shoes.

Either way, the package was kept safe from thieves by high grade wire doors, his politeness protocols, and a modified top-mounted, rapid-fire, waste-metal, railgun-turret. Any old bits and bobs of ferrous nature could be used to curtly cut down any would be cutpurses. 

The elements were kept at bay by means of a plastic bag — those things were still everywhere. He wondered, sometimes, where all the plastic had come from. Handy stuff to have.

As he travelled down the off-ramp he searched his memory banks and found the local Mr Deliver Hub. Surely — surely — this can’t be another forwarded address.

A summer shower of acid began to drizzle and sizzle on the asphalt.

“Mr Deliver! Rain, hail, or shine!”
