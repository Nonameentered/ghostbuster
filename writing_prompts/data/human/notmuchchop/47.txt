Our story begins as many others before have and as many after shall. It is a story of people and of places — a tale of the merry dance of choice and chance.

(Psst!)

The characters...(wait...too late now). The characters you shall meet are of that peculiar ilk — they are individuals free of common archetypes and yet in each we can find an aspect of ourselves. Their relationships and their lives will allow us to escape our world and yet explore its faults.

(Hey! Psst!)

But what...of setting?

(What’re we doing? Oy!)

The places, oh, the places you shall see in this most...*brilliant* of tales.

(Can you at least give me a genre?)

Why, the places shall become characters onto themselves — with history and depth. Be it a small area or a broad space; you shall come to know these locations as though they were your own homes and towns and countries...and contents. And planet...

(I can’t keep vamping without giving misinformation. What. Are. We. *Doing*?)

Come, let us not waste a moment more with mere promises and pontification*. It is time at last...to begin.

\*A Quick note: Pontificate, used here as a Verb\*\*, means to pompously\*\*\* or dogmatically\*\*\*\* express an opinion. And — I must admit — my language has, thus far, leaned quite sharply towards a certain over-wrought and somewhat archaic\*\*\*\*\* pretension\*\*\*\*\*\*. Do not worry, this habit shall likely be calmed as the story progresses and I am less needed as a directly interactive element.

\*\*Verbs are words that are used to express and action or—oh, for crying out loud!

Look. The damn authors missed the deadline again, alright. Just. Just go. There’s nothing here, I don’t even know what this was going to be about. There might not have even been characters.

It could have been a meandering exploration of a setting as a means to discuss humanities affects on a landscape. 

It could have been a love story set in a seamless endless void!

I. Don’t. Know.

So, bugger off!

Wasting my time...damn authors...and readers. Bastards. The lot of them.
