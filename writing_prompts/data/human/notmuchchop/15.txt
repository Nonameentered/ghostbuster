“Try not to blink.”

The Detector had changed shape over the years, it had grown smaller and more portable. More available too, what with the ever growing population.

“Don’t blink, please.”

No longer was the device a series of balanced stones, an obsidian altar, brass mirrors, and crystals and sigils. Now it was a metallic bongo-drum looking thing with a gun grip. Lasers from one end, results on the other. No need for heavy tomes to interpret results. Point and click and zap and here’s your career, kid!

“Okay, lets try again. Don’t. Blink.”

Things had changed a great deal, but the same crystals and sigils were at play within the Detectors core. Refined magic. Technomancy!

“You blinked.”

“Dint!”

“Look, you did. I need a clear scan of your eyes or the detector won’t—”

“Guh! Just scan me, jeez.”

“Look! I’m...trying to.” The Assessor was tapping his fingers on the Detector. Not a nervous habit, more a rage release. It had been a long day. He took a deep breath and lifted the device.

On the end closest to him he could see a pair of digitally magnified peepers. “Now. I’m going to pull the trigger on three. Keep your eyes closed and open them when I say two. Okay.”

“Jeez, man, I’m not stupid.”

“Sure you’re not. Now...One.”

The kid was a portly teen coated in a greasy film of poor hygiene, who called a local orphanage home. He was likely about to be sent out into the world with a career.

“Two.”

The world is filled with opportunities, and as a busy Assessor, the technician had had a hand in several big success stories. Some were even orphans as well! He did not have high hopes for this kid...especially as he had ignored the plan and stared into the detector, blinking at random intervals.

“Three!”

A flash! A beep...and ping! He had done it.

“Okie dokie,” Said the Assessor. “It’s processing now, just needs to load.”

“So what am I? A samurai? A chef?”

“Its loading.” He’s be something he could handle. Something society needs him to be. “You’ll be whatever the fates decide that you...would be...best...at? What!”

“Jeez, stress out much?”

“No. No that can’t...is that even an option?”

“Whazzit say?”

“I. I have to get someone, one moment, wait here, just...don’t go anywhere.

Half an hour later and an Assistant found the Assessor in the archives, flicking through books and unrolling scrolls.

“Um. Your three o’clock is still waiting. What’s going on?”

“Look.” The Assessor tapped the display of the Detector, the device was currently a paper weight, but the last results were still on the screen. “See that?”

The Assistant picked it up. Tapped through the scan results and shrugged. “Yeah. And?”

“Did you *read* it!?”

“Yeah—”

“Did you meet that kid? No way! No way! Something has gone *wrong*.”

“That’s a bit harsh, boss.”

“What!? What is wrong with you.”

“I reckon he could do it, with some practice.”

“Pract—wha-what!? Are you *insane*. I mean how do you practice *that*? How?”

“You...take lessons? Oh! Oh, you big idiot—um...sir. Sorry. You thought it said GOD.”

“Yeah it—”

“Was zoomed in. You must have tapped the increase text size button somehow.”

“...maybe. But, then...what is he?”

The Assistant handed the now re-calibrated Detector to the Assessor. He read the result and frowned.

“Gogodancer?”

“Hyep.”

“As in...with the...”

“Uh-huh.”

The Assessor sighed and rubbed his eyes. “I’m going to go tell him and then...I’m on break for an hour.”
