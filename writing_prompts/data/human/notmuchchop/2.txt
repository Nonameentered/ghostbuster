Blood and pacts go together like chainsaws and hockey masks, or sand and eyeballs, or little toes and coffee table legs, or spending a weekend with your in-laws and your partner won’t let you drink yourself into a stupor of inner escapism, or pixar movies where the two main characters are opposites that come to appreciate and love their differences.

That is to say, Blood and Pacts — when wedged together — are: scary, painful, shocking, saddening, and...a boring cliche. It’s done to death! Lots of history and, sure, it evokes a certain air but...meh!

Used to be you’d stay the signers quill-gripped hand and you’d say: “Why no, Sir. Not in ink. You must sign...in blood.”

Then the human would get all shaky and it would hit them — hit them *hard* that they were doing it! They wee making a deal with a devil. Now-a-days it’s: Where do I sign, not a problem, got a vial of my own red-stuff here and a fountain pen ready. Scribble scribble, whoopty doo. I’ll see you at the ironic consequences.

If it weren’t for the need of human fluid (that’s what our contracts need, the signature doesn’t matter), I’d let ‘em use ink. Then, as I was helping this soggy sorrowful lass with a bit of vengeance in exchange for a soul, she surprised me.

She wiped her hand across her tear streaked, mascara stained cheeks (and under her snotty nose), and then dabbed the quill in that! Signed in sadness, she did.

Across these past few millenia, blood had been the ink of choice. The symbol of life. A part of yourself. Ritual and nature clotted together in a vein born soup.

And then, bam! She changes the game. Tears. Pain and sorrow and loss. Blood is people. Tears are feelings. What a rush! To know that there is more yet to see.

Anyways, I’ve got to go and break a ladies heart — my clients ex-girlfriend. A horrific, demon-based, overkill tit for tat kind of deal. Tears. What a day.

I’m shaking! You know what?

“Hey, lady.”

“..yeah..what?” She was rugged up, arms crossed, fresh streaks of unhappiness slid down her cheeks.

“I’m gonna do this for free.”

“What?”

“You pulled me outta a rut! I can do a mortal a nicety every now and then.”

“Oh?”

“Does mean less magic, though. Contracts give me rights to work in this realm.”

“Oh.”

“Wanna go mess up your cheating bitch of an ex together?” I held out a red hand. She looked down and blinked, snorted back some running nose juice...and nodded.

“Yeah. Fuck it.” She took my hand in her snot and tear coated mitt and shook it.

“Atta girl!”
