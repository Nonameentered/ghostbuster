“I think he’s really lost it this time. Something is up with his head. His brain. Something’s snapped.”

Rissa didn’t look up from her tablet-borne crossword. “His brain is too gooey to snap.”

“Brains are supposed to be gooey-” 

“Yes, but his is gooey because it’s pudding instead of brains.”

“Rissa,” Said Herb. “I’m serious. He thinks the birds are talking to him.”

“Did he finally encounter a parrot?”

“Riss! Can you *please* put down your puzzles for a second? We *need* to talk. I think Manny needs *actual* help.”

There had been something in Herb’s tone. An earnest quality that was like chalk to his usual cheesy sarcasm. She finished the crossword and then put the device down. There was a streak to maintain, Manny mental state emergency be damned.

“Okay, okay. So what’s up? He thinks songbirds are singing secret messages to him?”

“Not singing. Tapping.”

“Tapping?”

“Tapping. In Morse code.”

“Who taught the idiot Morse code?”

“I mean, if a bird knows Morse code can you really call it an id-”

“Manny! Who taught *Manny* Morse code.” Rissa rubbed her eyes “*Idiot*.”

“Oh. Um. He said he taught himself.”

“So, the idiot had an idiot for a teacher? And now he thinks birds are pecking out missives addressed to him?”

“Well, apparently it's just a sentence.”

“Is it: more seeds in the feeder, please, and keep the cat inside?”

“No-”

“Herb, if it’s just the letter E over and over again, I’m going to be very upset.”

“He says they keep saying: it’s coming.”

“Huh.” Rissa’s eyebrows had raised at that. 

Manny was a well known and accurately labelled moron, but he wasn’t the paranoid sort. Usually. That sort of thing takes an understanding of things like threats and danger. Rissa stood, snatched up her tablet, and looked in the store for a Morse code app as she walked past Herb. He followed her down the hall towards the bird-brained, bird-bothered Manny.

They’d get to the bottom of this.

“See! See! You get the same answer!” Manny thrust his phone at Rissa’s face and then at Herb’s back. “See!”

Rissa blinked long and slow. Herb was silent — he wanted to laugh, but this was cancelled out by the fact Rissa would be mocking him for the foreseeable future.

“The birds." Said Manny to the window. "They’re trying to warn us!”

Rissa had her tablet held outwards. Screen pointed at the manic moronic Manny. His answer was there, if he would just stop and read it. On Rissa’s device, there was an app: MorseCoderer. The same one on Manny’s phone. 

Just load the app, press the button to record Morse code, and then the app would tell you what the message was in plain old English. And the pair had, indeed, got the same answer from the birds and their secret tap-tap-taps.

The only difference was that the *entire* message could fit on Rissa’s screen.

It’s coming soon! App under development.

“What does it mean, Rissa! What’s coming?”

Herb walked away. Rissa tapped her tablet and stared at Manny. He looked at where her finger was...and slowly lifted his phone to the secret Morse code message she was sending.

“Idiot!”
