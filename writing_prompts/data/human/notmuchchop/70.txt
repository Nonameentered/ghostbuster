Dr Velocifrost was crouched, his icy, serpentine eyes on his latest victim: another would-be hero who had decided they were worthy of taking a shot at him. Him! The greatest villain the city had ever known. 

“Do you get it now? Compared to you, with your...what was it? Slightly above average physical traits and the ability to fly? Well, either way...compared to you I am like a God. No. I *am* God.”

“Duuuude,” Said a voice from above them “You’re, like, not even close to me.”

The velociraptor-headed man closed his blue eyes, slouched his black armor-clad shoulders, and let his not-up-to-current-science-scaley-instead-of-feathery-dino-head slump forward — all the while a foggy, ice-glittered sigh poured from his mouth and nose. A slow deflation of deep annoyance. 

“Oh for crying out loud.” He said, to himself. “I’ll be right back with you in a moment, hero. Stay frozen, would you?”

Dr Velocifrost stood and stared to the heavens. By which one means the ceiling.

“*You* are *not* God.”

“Then why’s my voice all over the place?” Said the up-for-debate possible Deity.

“We’ve been over this! *You* are a disembodied electromagnetic-*telepath* that I killed a few months ago. You’re stuck in my P.A. System.”

On the ground the young hero seized the distraction and squirmed. The ice that bound him creaked. If he could just —the sky-blue blast from Dr Velocifrost’s palm added a thick layer of hard-water entrapment to the hero. Who then remained still.

Very still.

“Waddya mean *we’ve been over it*?” Said the speakers in the Secret Lair’s Lunchroom Ceiling. “Not ringing any bells to little old me — you know: All knowing God.”

“You haven’t got much memory storage in this form, is my guess.” Said the Villain. “And I keep resetting the electronics to clear you out. Going to have to try and power the whole place down, next. Hmm. That might do it, actually.”

A blue-scaled claw scratched a blue-scaled jaw. *That really might work. Make sure there’s no residual electricity.*

“Soooo.” Said the P.A. Poltergeist “You wanna play some discgolf or something?”

“No.” Said Dr Velocifrost as he marched towards the fusebox.
