The sky is blue. Not a cloud in sight. Not a bird, plane, or a Superman up there  — as far as I could see, anyway.

And yet...

In my hand is my wallet. A wallet that had been produced, just a moment ago, by that same uncluttered and unpopulated azure star tarp. The lime green and electric purple, velcro sealed, FunZone wallet that I’d had for years and continue to use ironically. 

Sky born. 

It fell out of my pocket and then out of the sky to land at my feet in front of me. What. In. The. How?

Fuck?

A few moments ago...

Cool! Tables fairly neat, I’ll get this cleaned up real quick. Bloody heck, these outdoor tables are popular. Hm? What’s that? Oh, a child’s wallet. Maybe there’s a name inside and if not? Probably some free Arcade Tickets. 

Oh. A child who has a drivers license?

That was the guy who was sitting here—there he is! Nuts. Pretty far down the street.

I can make that.

Hup!

Huh? What? No I didn’t. I did not just throw a wallet at a cust—nailed it! At his feet! Where’s the catch!?
