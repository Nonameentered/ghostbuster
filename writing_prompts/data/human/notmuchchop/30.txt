“For those over in the East Kalvan region: the sunshine is sticking around and temperatures are on the rise. Stay hydrated and seek shade if you're prone to sunburn or are vampiric. Lower Obbston seeing similar as well, but winds coming off the ocean will keep things cooler high swells good for surfers but remember to share those waves and always check for merfolk.”

“Over in the West: Glass Crater and surrounding areas will be seeing light showers early in the week, culminating in a big storm on Freyday, so expect fog and steam coming off the World Wound all week.”

“A quick look up north and The Castle Ranges will be experiencing heavy Dragons starting Moonsday. Weatherwise, not much of great import given the situation. If you’re in the area, follow  local recommendations from the Draconic Response Bureau. Back to you Kurtlissa!”
