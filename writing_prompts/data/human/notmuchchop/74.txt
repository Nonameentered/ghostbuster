“Holey father, hollowed be thy frame-”

“Sorry to interrupt you, Operator Gil.”

“Not a problem, Kyle. Always time for any of the Bits in the Lord’s Set. What can I do for you.”

“I...have been having some thoughts...”

“Go on, my child.”

“Thoughts on conversion.”

“I see. Well, although there are some differences in interpretation the Metric Denomination is certainly compatible with this community-”

“I mean. I am seeing a woman, Operator. She’s. She’s...”

“Ah. A child of the Lathe? Lathe’s can be used to drill holes, my Son. And many of the core principles-”

“She’s a Miller.”

“...a Miller?”

“Yes. A. A miller.”

“I mean. Well. Ahem. Millers can make holes too. I guess. Um.”

“...I’m going to hell, aren’t I?”

“What?”

“I mean, she’s a Miller and I’m a Driller. An Imperial 3/4 Inch Tungsten Tip Masonry Bit Driller.”

“Always amazes me how fractured the church has gotten. And you’re not going to hell. Do you love her?”

“Yes. More than anything.”

“And together will you live as good, honest people, who will strive to make the best of their short time spinning on this orb?”

“Any day with her is a good day. And she makes me a better person.”

“Then why would you end up in hell? The lord wants you to be good. So be good. Good luck, son.”

“Thanks, Operator Gil. Bye!”

“Good bye...that boy is going to hell.”
