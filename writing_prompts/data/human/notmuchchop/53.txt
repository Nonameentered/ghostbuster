Two AM on an empty highway. The car, more undead scrapheap, rattles as we go. No speeding, though. Can’t risk it. The shitbox of a vehicle smells vaguely of fuel, mildly of bin juice, and strongly of cigarettes. They had taken the trash out of the passenger side footwell and the back seats when I bought it earlier today.

An absolute junker. But, hey, it was cheap and they accepted cash. It runs well enough. No radio. That’d been stolen, oh, three years ago by the previous owners guess. I have no phone to play music with, either (pawned it). 

I don’t mind. At the right speed or in the right breeze the back left window whistles. So, you know, there’s that to keep me company.

What a piece of shit.

My co-pilot is a duffle-bag. Contents of said bag? A smaller satchel. A toiletry bag with one toothbrush, the associated paste, a comb, nail clippers, a razor with three cartridges, sensitive-skin aloe shaving foam, B.O Basher (deodorant), and an emergency roll of T.P.

The toiletry bag is swaddled in the duffle in a nest of wads. Cash wads. The kind with paper bands from banks to tell you what each wad is worth.

How much, total?

Fifty fucking kay.

Fifty *thousand* dollars.

So, what’s a guy in an ancient, near-death Toyota Camry doing with that much scratch? 

Wish I could tell you it was heist. 

Wish I could tell you I earned it.

What actually happened is...I found it. None-to-soon, either. Things weren’t going well for your old friend. I had a few hundred left in my bank and had taken it out to invest in my habits. A one last hurrah kinda deal.

I had been in an alley off an alley — taking a tinkle — when an SUV screeched to a halt, a fella jumped out, and chucked the bag in a dumpster. As they zipped out, I zipped up and investigated and...

Pay dirt!

If you keep this sort of thing in the scene — in the same town — well...you get found and then quickly lost. Usually as several neat packages stored across the city dump.

So, I snatched the sack and ran. Bought a car with the last of my own cash, grabbed what I needed from my place and...boosted.

What’s the worst that can go wrong?

A marimba began to play on the non-existent radio. Wait. No. It’s the bag.

The phone I hadn’t known about rang.

Phone?

Fffffuck.
