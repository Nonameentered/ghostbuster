“So. Just to be sure I heard you correctly: you had been busy at work, translating a previously unprocessed manuscript...”

“Yes, Dean.”

“And, through the application of your continued diligence and considerable expertise, you were able to decipher this...unrecognised, uncategorised, and untranslated text...”

“...yes, Dean.”

“And, through the aloud enunciation of this text — through the simple act of sounding out a language that, up until this afternoon had not been said in who knows how long — you-wait. Wait. Did you read the untranslated or translated text out loud?”

“...um. Translated, Dean.”

“Ah. Details, you see, I do like details. Through reading aloud the *translated* text: your will was made manifest and-”

“I mean. I-Oh, sorry to interrupt, Dean.”

“No, no. Do go on. Details details.”

“I meant to say that, uh, it wasn’t my...my will. I didn’t. I didn’t want *this*.”

“Oh. You didn’t want this? You didn’t want the Colleges Library to be a smoldering pile of moistened embers with firefighters traipsing atop the remains?”

“Uh. No.”

“Well, then. That *is* good. Had you wanted this I would be *very* upset. But! You didn’t want this and it was the fault of some heretofore unencountered magic.”

“...yes, Dean.”

“...definitely not someone having a sneaky smoke in the parchment room again because it was cold outside.”

“No, Dean.”

“Good. That’s good. What was the magic word, anyway?”

"Uh....um...Go-Go fireball?"

It took eight fire-fighters to pull the Dean off of the thoroughly beaten supposedly magical bastard.
