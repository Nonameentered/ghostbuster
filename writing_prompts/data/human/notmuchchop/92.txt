“And what of my planet?”

“Which one is that. Any idea, Flermin?”

“Zatz, they are from the one with the monkey people that keep making new ways to either: A, blow each other up; B, get fatter; or C, get...*tender* with their nethers.”

“That describes a number of planets, Flermin.”

“Earth. I am from Earth.”

“Again, in the vastness of spacetime, that is the name of a number of planets. Flermin, do you have the co-ordinates.”

“Yes, Zats. Here.”

“Hmm. Ah, *that* place.”

“*That* place. Why the disgust?”

“Well. Your planet has a singular peculiarity. Or rather the people of your planet do. Right, Flermin?”

“Right, Zats.”

“What is it?”

“Of any intelligent species on any planet in the vast and infinite cosmos, your people are the most...”

“...most what?”

“I was tempted to say: just the *most*. You are a lot to take, really. But, it is because you are the most self-centered, self-obsessed, wankers we have ever met. Right, Flermin?”

“No offence, People Person of Earth. Zats is right. Your race has so very many tales of being the greatest for some asinine reason or other.”

“You are what we call a ‘Main Character’ species. Kind of annoying, really.”

“No we-”

“Have you read your science fiction?”

“...well.”
