"Oh Ancient One, hear my plea!"

Thr air before the young man crackled, a torrent of power rushing through it. With a terrible rip a tear formed, maddeningly deep depths behind. A figure moved within, gigantic fingers reaching through the break in reality. It strained, pulling the tear open further, revealing its head.

It was smooth, near featureless grey skin. A series of bumps ran around the entirety of its skull, in regular spaces. As one they opened, revealing multicoloured eyes looking in all directions. One looked down at the would-be warlock, and it spoke without a mouth.

"Who risks their mind to summon me?"

The young man shivered, feeling monumentally small before the thing in front of him. Both in terms of physical size and strength. This was a being that saw reality in a way that was incomprehensible to him. It saw the laws of nature, and chose to ignore them. And he had called it.

"Oh Ancient One, I come before you as a humble servant. Grant me a shred of your power, and I shall grant you a soul."

It slowly blinked, before vibrating the air once more with a sourceless voice.

"I have had many offer their souls to me. I tire of such things."

The young man bowed, lowering his head.

"I would not seek to bore you. Rather, I offer you an unwilling soul, that of a monster."

The thing focused a second eye on the bowing form, seeing into the depths of his mind. It watched for a moment, watching the life of the one before it.

"Your father I see. The one who hurts you and your mother."

The young man shivered again. Its mental reading felt like thorns scratching his thoughts. A bearable pain, but unlike any he had felt before.

"That is true, Ancient One. I offer you to take his soul as payment."

The thing was silent, it's mind slowly anticipating what it might find. Finally it reached out with a previously hidden hand, clutching into the air.

"Very well. The deal is struck."

It was followed by an echoing cry, as a spectral form on the young man's father appeared in its grasp. He looked around in anger, focusing on the young man.

"What did you do? You moron! I'm going to kick your ass again, once you have fixed this!"

The being pulled back, drawing the soul outside of reality. The father turned to it in horror, screaming as he was drawn away. The rift began to close, before a small bead of white shot out. It impacted the young man's chest, filling him with its blessing. His world was rocked, as a new understanding came to him, and new visions of its connections appeared.

All it had cost him was the soul of a monster.
