Before the ink on the Supernatural Treaty had dried, I had the job. It had been unofficial before, helping Yelgra manage her flashbacks. I helped ground her, knowing the right areas to scratch, or the correct artifacts to bring to her attention to distract her from the past.

There had been a long time when humans were at the mercy of supernatural beings. We weren't the only mortals to suffer their wrath, but we were the only ones to truly persevere. The elves had lived in their forests, believing in the magic of nature. Until the forest spirits took umbrage at them, and levelled their homes. The dwarves hid underground, until the earth swallowed them up in the form of wyrms.

Orcs, gnomes, and avions all fell, their civilisations collapsing. The only reason us humans survived was dumb luck. We would rapidly return to ruined cities. We had constantly roving nomads. And the patronage of a few nice monsters. Some of the other races survived with us, but we are by far the majority.

It all changed when we discovered gunpowder, using it to fire bullets at shocking speeds. They were easy to make, and easy to enchant to break through resistances. We turned from the hunted into the hunters. Monsters fell in droves to us. They came forward to ask for peace. They approached us.

We accepted of course. With their numbers culled, we could easily survive. There would be some rogues of course, but as a whole it would prove beneficial.

Thats what I heard anyway. I had spent much of the Decade of Slaughter helping Yelgra. She had looked out for us, protecting us from the others of her kind who would see our villages as snacks. But whilst she was a beacon of kindness, her children unfortunately were not. She was there when they were killed, the memories scarring her mind.

I chose to help. I could break her out of them, keeping her happy. Sort of as payment for what she had done for us, but also because I hated to see her hurting. I essentially became her emotional support human. As she was the first to have one, naturally others wanted to see what it was like.

"So Yelgra, does he really help?"

The speaker was a Garrozam, an oversized centipede like creature, one that oozed a sticky substance that could burn like acid at will. It had noticeable burn scarring along it's back, and was missing quite a few of its legs.

Yelgra glanced at me, as I leaned into her side.

"He is invaluable. With him I can go out and not worry about having an episode. You would be surprised how comforting a human can be Tzzazz."

Tzzazz leaned down to me.

"And you human, do you really think your sort help us?"

I looked at it coolly.

"I believe so. We hurt you, I won't deny. But we are trying to make reparations. It will take time, but we learn what makes you happy, or distracted, and what episodes start with. And having a voice of reason can help you express yourself. We can't undo what's been done. But we can help you live again."
