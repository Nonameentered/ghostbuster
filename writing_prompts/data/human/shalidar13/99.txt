When you court Death, she changes you in return. Most only experience it once, maybe twice if they are lucky enough to be raised. The void leaves its mark all the same. Those who have returned bear this in their darkest thoughts, and deep recesses of their heart.

I am much more different. Death does not want me. She refuses to claim me, letting Life come for me again and again. But Life cannot wipe away the void in its entirety. It clings to me. It saps my skin, and haunts my breath. It shows me the shadows of people, their souls encased in prisons of flesh.

But in return, it's power feeds into me. When chosen by oblivion, tiredness has no meaning. It gives me the strength of those who succumb to it, the lucky ones who Death accepts. And I hold a dark hunger, one I have always suppressed.

I awoke again, my last wound fading. A lucky arrow had struck my head whilst I focused on defending against the invading Astral Monks. I expected the other heros to have driven them back by my return. Sure enough, as I opened my eyes the kaleidoscopic tear was gone, replaced by dull grey skies.

A cry drew my attention. Seerea started at me, horrified. A glowing bolt of blue light appeared in her hand, lashing out at me. But the shadow that followed me ate it up, as she continued to shout.

"It's here! Help!"

I went to frown, feeling nothing move. If I could feel cold I would have, as I looked around for something reflective. A window drew my attention, and I slowly stepped over. Another bolt came and was devoured as before, my mind barely noticing. I stared at the face that looked back, different yet familiar.

I was left with a skull, my eye sockets an empty black mass. The lurking shadow coiled around me, the fabric of the void in the material world. I could understand why she thought I was a monster. I looked like one, with my face now gone.

Another bolt flew at me, and I swatted at it, annoyed.

"Will you stop that?!"

It was followed by a haunting *shunk* and her eyes widened. I froze, as a shard of black pierced her chest. The mage prodigy looked down at herself, weakly grasping it. She collapsed as a group of heroes I didn't know rounded the corner. The black shard returned to me, and I felt the hunger inside less, her essence drawn into me.

"It got Seerea! Die monster!"

The one at the head yelled out, beginning to run in their heavy plate armour. A mace glowed with light as they raised it, preparing to smite me. Another drew their bow, sending arrows at me. The last began to summon a ball of fire.

I wanted to get them to stop. But I knew they wouldn't now. Not after what they had seen. No-one would try and help me now. I was on my own. And I knew now, I was a monster.

I turned to run, feeling the void agree with my statement, as though it had always known what I was. Other adventuring heroes appeared, throwing rock and arrow and spell at my back. I let myself be chased off, fleeing from those I had once called my family.

Deep within me, the dark hunger began to grow again, barely satiated with Seerea's life. It would want more. I would want more soon enough. And I doubted I would have the strength to resist any more.
