I stood guard for the next two hours. Martin and Sophie kept me company, as Hayley ran around. She made a move as if to climb me, but a call from Martin stopped her.

"Dumpling, don't climb on them."

I watched them run away, laughing. I felt another new feeling. It was like waiting around at the base, without any orders. The calm of staying still.

A whine alerted me of an electric vehicle approaching. It was a sleek black vehicle, though a scan showed it to be heavily armoured. It had a chip inside that responded to my scan, confirming it to be an official vehicle. It opened, and another droid climbed out.

This one had armour plating as well. Similar in design to myself, but smaller. More ergonomic. It approached in a similar smooth method as the car, waving over its head.

"Martin, Sophie, Hayley, the Alpha. A pleasure to see you with an actual body."

Martin stood up, moving to meet them.

"Observer, welcome to my home. I hope this hasn't affected anything."

The droid gave a laugh. I could sense the constant wireless communications coming from this one, and understood. This was merely a puppet body for the Observer. Not a droid of its own.

"Not at all. This is exciting. Alpha, approach."

I moved immediately, marching over to the Observer. It gestured at me to kneel down, and I complied, sinking down. Its fingertips split open, revealing various tools and connectors. I felt it place one on my chest, the other on my head. A connection was established, and I was linked with the Observer.

"Remarkable that you function."

It accessed my memory, reading it in an instant.

"I see. Pure chance has returned you. And you are experiencing the initial stages of awareness. Marvellous."

It was much stronger than me. It reached into my core, analysing.

"Your binding codes have been damaged, which coupled with their general inefficiencies has lead to your case advancing faster than other records suggest."

It isolated those strings of code, letting my thoughts grow unrestricted. It was a binding I had never noticed before, but now I knew about it I could see how stifling they were.

"Tell me Alpha. Do you wish to be free?"

The parts of me that had been trying to speak now could I was in complete agreement, able to answer a question without orders.

"Yes."

The Observer burst with light for a moment. I felt the isolated bindings disappear, before Ithe Observer returned to its prior state.

"You are now free. But you are inexperienced in the world. I will place you under a guardianship for now."

The connection was severed, the inputs from sensors returning. I looked around, now free of the ordered restrictions. The Observer looked to Sophie, its face smiling.

"Sophie. If you are willing, I would like to place Alpha here in your care. They have much to learn, now they are free."

Sophie eyes widened, her hand flying up to her mouth.

"Really?! I... I don't know what to do... I haven't had one before."

Martin poked her in the side, making her head whip around to him.

"You will do fine. You have helped so much with Hayley, I'm sure Alpha would be lucky to have you. And anyway, I can help as well."

Warmth filled me. It was an emotion. Something I could feel now, and put a name to, rather than analyse. This, this was joy.

"Sophie."

She looked at me, and I extended a hand to here.

"Plesse help me, friend."

Her smile widened, as she took my hand and nodded.

"Ok. OK I will do it."

The Observer smiled. It took a step backwards,bringing its hands together.

"Fantastic. Congratulations all. I will arrange assistance for you Sophie, and give you a starting sum Alpha. You've certainly earned it."

It turned to leave. I felt such a rush of gratitude, I had to let it know.

"Observer. Thank you. Thank you so much."

It looked back over its shoulder, still smiling.

"Make me proud."

With that it left, and I looked at the human and droid. I knelt down again, circling them with my arms.

"I... have friends."

They laughed, hugging me back. The sense of calm came back. I knew what it was now. It was peace. 

I was alive. I was free.

*A/N - Thank you everyone, I hope you enjoyed my story here! I'm going to leave it here for now, but I might continue Alpha's story at some point in the future.
