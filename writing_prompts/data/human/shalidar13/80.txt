I started small, as all necromancers did. A few insects, a mouse, the pigeon I retrieved from one of the village cats. They followed me unquestioningly, as I rose them from the dead. Their existence was tied to me, their intelligence still that of a living equivalent.

Each one was hard to bring back. The pigeon was the hardest, costing me much of my days supply of mana. But each was useful. I could understand the process, make it easier for the next time. I could limit the loss of power, as my kind of mage always attempted.

It was common to work together, as we each grappled with the same problem. How to raise more efficiently. There were tales of the First Raiser, and how they brought back armies. They had found a fallen dragon, and made even that return from the beyond. It was assumed to be exaggeration of course. But we all had the tiny question, of if it was possible.

After learning from the few nearby necromancers, I took to travelling. Barely into my adulthood, I threw myself into trying to improve myself. I would wander for days, resurrecting anything I could find. Each time trying to improve. It got to the point I had a small army of insects and forest creatures following my every move. I could keep them from fully rotting, allowing me to build up a decent force.

As I travelled, I struck gold. Or rather, it struck me, in the form of a mage bane. Four leathery wings around a fanged mouth, it was a nightmare for full mages. It would latch on, draining mana. This thing attached itself to my arm as I slept, weakening me. But when I woke up, I commanded my followers to kill it.

I lost many of them that day, but in turn gained the body of a mage bane. I carried it with me into the next day, after I had restored what it had drained. There, I set about bringing it back under my control. It exhausted me, more than I expected. But I had one all the same. And from that, an idea formed.

I told it to lead me to its nest. Once I found it, I had my followers kill the other two inside. This time most of my force was lost, their bodies breaking from the strain. But in the end, I had another two bodies. Bodies I raised over the next couple of days, to give me three of the nightmares.

I took them to a town, with a much larger population. During the day I worked as a barman in a pub in exchange for food, lodgings and a small amount of coin. In the night, I had them seek out mages, and drain a portion as they slept. Not enough for them to be weakened the next day, and spread pit over many. They returned to me, and passed the mana into a storage crystal I had managed to buy.

It steadily grew, a battery for my work. I didn't know how the First Raiser did it, but I assumed they had a monstrous well of mana. Or they did something like this, having mana donated or taken.

I measured it compared to my daily rate, that which I too passed into the crystal. Within a week it was nearly a hundred fold stronger than mine. It grew quicker as I found the strongest mages, bidding my banes to drain from them first.

After a full season passed, the crystal was dangerously full. I counted my coin, just able to stretch it far enough to buy a second crystal. I began to fill that, and researched the nearby area. After a week of studying, I found a promising site. A dragon had fallen nearby, a few decades back. Its body had been left there, with its skull supposedly still above ground.

I decided to make a trip out there. I had my full crystal with me, and my mage banes to back me up. Either I would be triumphant, or have a better understanding of just how realistic the old tales were.
