"Really, it doesn't work for you? You really don't want to rule with me?"

The Deep King frowned. He had expected the hero to be angry at the thought. Maybe the offer could entice them to change. But not to brush it off almost, wearily?

"How much thought have you put into ruling? You make your people obey through fear of punishment. You keep them under pressure, mental chains in place of the physical."

The hero casually spoke of it. She had a tired air, as though discussions of ruling bored her.

"Indeed I do. And it works, don't you see? They bow and scrape in the hopes they survive until the next day. Their meager lives are at my very whim. To them I'm a god, why do you not want that?"

She sighed again.

"And that's exactly why you can't succeed. You think yourself above the people. But if you are, you need to work for them. You keep them fed, clothed and homed. You give them entertainment. You fight for them, not for you."

She sighed again, gesturing to herself.

"Through ruling by fear, you create people like me. You may catch the first few. You might kill the first hundred. But in the end, one will get you. The fear you rule with will rule you as well."

The Deep King laughed.

"Oh really? You would have me rule through love? How weak."

The hero sighed again.

"It's the only way to really rule, and survive at it. Though I wouldn't expect you to change, having seen your actions."

She casually drew her sword, pointing it at the Deep King.

"I guess we should get started then?"
