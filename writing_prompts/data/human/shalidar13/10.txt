"They'll find me beast, and you will be slain."

I looked up at the monster that took me. Blue scales glinted in the life, as a fanged maw opened. I felt got breath wash over me, tinged with the scent of smoke.

"Beast? I'm offended princess."

It's voice was deep, enough to shake my bones. I glared up at death made flesh, hating its entire existence.

"I merely sought one who had a refined enough palate to give feedback on my dishes. It I'd hard to find in my kind, and harder still for a volunteer from your kingdom's."

I glared at it still, distrust in every corner of my being.

"You kidnapped me for a taster? What lies. You monsters are all the same, you want me for ransom."

It grumbled, pulling me further into its lair. I missed the open sky already, but had hope in Father's knights. They were strong and fair, surely not far behind.

"Ransom? I am not like the wyrms you know. I am older than even your kingdom little princess. I have my fill of gold and gems. No, now I seek only experiences."

It brought me into a large chamber, putting me in a clearly worn chair. Before it sat an equally worn large table, with crockery placed atop it. I sprung up to turn, as it closed the doors of the chamber. The thud as they closed told me how heavy they were. I wouldn't be able to open them.

"Wait here."

It's hot breath came over again, blowing my hair. I glowered at it, crossing my arms. I was outclassed, that I knew. I just had to stay alive until my rescue came. It stomped away, closing another large door behind it. I fumed as I sat, powerless in this place.

I didn't have to wait long, as it came back in with a steaming pot. The pot itself was larger than me, but it handled it as though it was little more than a mug.

"This is my first dish. Venison and root vegetable stew."

I could smell it, and felt my stomach rumble. Of course the beast had to snatch me before my evening meal with Father. I didn't want to eat its offering, but my stomach told me otherwise. I glared in its direction, spooning out a small amount. I blew on it to cool it down, before eating.

I expected it to be bad. But this wasn't anything like I thought. The meat was tender, the piece of potato well cooked. It was over spiced, the taste all most dominating the dish. But I was shocked. It was actually not back.

The dragon bared its teeth, gesturing to the pot.

"How is it?"

I still hated it. But it was clearly trying. I guess if I played its little game, I would survive until my rescue.

"The meat is perfectly done, just the right level of tenderness. But those potatoes are far too over cooked. You need to work on your spices as well, you out in far too much, it's dominating."

It nodded, cradling the pot.

"Thank you for your honesty. Its hard to know the right spice levels for such small beings. I will return soon with the next dish."

It left, and I sighed. This was going to be painful.
