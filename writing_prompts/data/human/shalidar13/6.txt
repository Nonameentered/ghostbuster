"Get him."

The last words I heard before a cloth bag was shoved over my head. It was followed by a couple of punches to my chest, knocking the wind from my lungs. Cold metal clicked around my wrists, as I dropped the bag I had been waiting with.

It was fast. Before I could really understand what was happening, I was being carried away. It blurred into one as they took me away, and my thoughts marred by fear. What was going to happen to me? What did they want? And what would my clients think?

These thoughts consumed me, as I withdrew from the outside world. Feeling weak and powerless wasn't an odd experience for me. But being kidnapped was.

The hood was torn from my head, as I was thrown bodily to a hard floor. The thud of my impact was soon followed by a door closing, with a lock being turned. I blinked around, taking in the squalid cell. The walls were damp, mold and mushrooms growing in the corners. A pile of wet straw was set to one side, with a bucket next to it. It was lit by a torch on the otherside if the bars, deliberately out of reach.

"Enjoy your stay. Hopefully for you someone will pay nice and quickly."

My eyes fell on the speaker, a hulking man with face in shadow. But I didn't need to see it to know he was grinning at me. I began to sweat. Ransom? Who were they ransoming me to?

"P-please... let me go."

My voice shook, elicting a laugh from the brute.

"Awww, poor pampered baby. We'll let you go, once we know someone's good for it. If not... well, there are other ways to make money from you."

He made a whip cracking sound, before laughing as he wandered off. That mere sound filled me with dread. I knew of places that sold men like cattle. I really, really didn't want to end up like that.

My arm began to burn, and I looked at it. I saw an image appear on my skin, an eye surrounded by scales. It looked around, before vanishing, the burn going with it. I rubbed it, the eye bothering me. I was sure I had seen it. The slit pupil and scales were obviously draconic. But it was too small to tell.

I huddled down on the straw, shaking. I didn't know what the future held. But I hoped someone would help me. I drifting into a fitful sleep, fear shivers turning to warming ones, as stone leeched the heat from my body.

\-----

I awoke to screams, and a earth shaking roar. The roar was echoed by another, the sounds of battle coming to me. I looked around in fear and confusion, trying to come to my senses. A roar came again, and my eyes widened. I knew exactly who that was.

I saw the entrance to my cell area brighten, light dancing. I was followed a moment later by horrific screams, and a figure wreathed in flames ran past. The ground shook, as something forced its way further in. I summoned my voice, hoping it wouldn't shake.

"Terronant, I'm in here!"

It was more of a scream than a shout. Still, it worked, as a large claw pulled its was around the corner. Stone cracked, as the dragon pulled its head into view. The same eye I saw on my arm looked at me, as Terronant looked me over.

"There you are. You're late for our appointment!"

I spluttered a laugh, shocked by his nonchalance. He grinned, before concentrating. I knew it took a lot of effort to do what he was doing, shrinking down to fit. Even as I watched his form drew smaller, making him easier to fit.

"Thats... better... let's... get... you... out..."

I stayed quiet, as the now horse-sized dragon crept in. With a dismissive swipe of his claws the door to my cell was torn open, freeing me. I ran forwards, unable to stop myself from hugging him.

"We.. will... have... time.. later... go... find... Politaz... she... get... you... out..."

He was clencheming tight, his size definitely uncomfortable. I backed away, nodding as I looked back the way he had come. I saw a broken tunnel, grooves carved into it. Patches of black painted the walls, around smouldering corpses. I shuddered, keeping my eyes ahead as I left.

I liked my clients. The fact the had come to help me was touching. But it would be a long time before I forget just how monstrous they could be.
