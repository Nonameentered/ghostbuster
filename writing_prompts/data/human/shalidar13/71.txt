I woke to the sounds of the city rising with me. All around I could hear faint closing doors and low voices. Below it was a perpetual low rumble of moans and groans. A year ago that would have been unthinkable. But that was before the Unquiet Dead came.

I thought back to how it started. A plague, spoken of from travellers from one of the frontier towns. They said how the town was not what it once was. Fields grew untended, flocks uncared for. Streets were dirty and filled with debris. But most disturbing of all they claimed were the people. They wandered with empty eyes, performing weak, repetitive actions.

Of course such claims were dismissed. It was ludicrous, a flight of fancy. Our benevolent leaders though humoured such rumours. They sent out a pair to investigate the town, letting us focus on work.

But it was too late. The travellers bore the plague, though they did not know of it. One by one they lost themselves, bodies turning as grey as their minds. Their voices, once boisterous and loud, became useless, words becoming moans. But they did not attack, as many feared the dead would. They merely wandered aimlessly, acting out old repeated actions.

It spread slowly. It was not spread by wind, bite or blood, but by simple touch. Those kind enough to help those who became ill fell to its creeping spread. They were the barest shades of their old selves, but still acted on their base selves. They tried to help, even if they could do little more than brush wounds.

If you showed them kindness, they would respond in kind. Their intelligence may be mostly gone, but they understood simple ideas. If asked to move away they would, with no fuss. Our kind rulers had tried to round them up, but it spread too easily, with a long incubation period.

Instead, the Unquiet Dead were carefully put in completely sealed overalls. Once put in they were left to roam, and help in simple tasks. With someone acting to corral them, they were useful for general help. Given brushes, they swept the streets. In cases of fire, they would form bucket chains, a constant stream of water.

So now we lived amongst them. It did hurt, seeing friends and family lost to it. But it helped, seeing them still around, with the faintest of recognition appearing on otherwise blank faces. It was hoped that one day, the glorious leaders would find a cure, and return them to us.
