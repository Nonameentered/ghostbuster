"Leave him."

The words were cold and cruel. I looked up at the speaker, a thin man with a sneer. His face was gaunt, a wiry black moustache the only semblance of colour. I wrinkled my nose, recognising this one.

"I'm not abandoning him Finas. Just because you failed to become a medic doesn't mean you are exempt from our rules."

Finas gave a laugh, his voice empty of compassion, instead flicked with rage.

"No? I believe it does, pacifist. He's mine, like it or not. If you don't give him over, I will take you with me as well."

I shook my head, glancing at the man I was saving. I had seen many before, their faces blurring into one. Maybe I had saved him before, maybe I hadn't. But my oath was strong, to save from harm.

"I will not let you take him, nor will you take me."

His laugh came again, this time oozing with anticipation. He was a failed medic. I knew he took it hard, declaring an outright hatred of us. But he had never interfered before now, abiding by the agreed rules of combat. This change was concerning.

"I hoped you would say that. Come, pathetic medic. Let us fight. Though your oath doesn't allow you does it?"

I gave a smirk. He didn't know the full depths of the oath, having only ever taken the basic version. The one that when he broke had stripped much of his vitality.

"You are right. The oath you know prevents a medic from fighting."

I laid the hero down gently, standing up straight. As I did I felt a gust of wind from behind, a pair of glowing yellow wings rising out from my spine.

"But I am a full combat medic. My oath allows me to fight those who would seek to prevent me from carrying out my work, so long as I provide treatment to those I fight."

Finas's eyes widened, as I let the power of the oath fill me. It highlighted the plates on my chest, the armour becoming thicker. My fists felt heavier, my fingers somehow more nimble. I blinked, seeing points of his body marked. Nerve clusters.

I fell into a fighting stance, one unfamiliar to me. But I didn't need to know it. The oath told me how to fight. Its spirit filled me, giving me the strength and experience to win. Finas shook, before anger crossed his face again. He summoned a blade of ice, holding it up.

"Fine then! Have it your way!"

He swung at me, and I effortlessly dodged. I placed a punch on his arm, raising a knuckle to drive deep into the muscles. The effect was instant, as it dropped to the side. He hissed in pain, turning back to me.

"You'll die for that!"

I shook my head again, the spirit speaking with me in a echo of my voice.

"No I won't."
