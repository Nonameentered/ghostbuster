It is said the first sword forged was no mere weapon. The first of its kind, it boasted an alien intelligence. Whoever wielded it gained strength and instinctive experience, making them near undefeatable in combat. In return it had them move, something it could not do itself.

But over the years since its creation, the sword's bloodlust faded. Battle was too easy for it, being near guaranteed to be in the hands of the victor. It looked to the future, to understand what would come its way. It peered through the flow of fate, to see two paths beyond.

The first was the one of war and death, the path it had been following already. It could live under the constant flow of battle and blood, until one day it would finally be broken. It would leave behind nothing but destruction and a mountain of corpses.

The second was one of purpose. In place of seeking out battle, it would let battle come to it. Those who had to fight, they would find it. With it in hand, they would follow their own destiny, with the sword lending its strength to their own. Once it was done, the sword would be placed in a secure place, for the next aspiring champion to find it.

The sword chose the less easy path. It commanded its bearer to finish their battle, then leave. It had them take it into the heart of a forest, into an open cavern. In its centre the rocks reached up towards the heavens, a fitting resting spot. There its bearer thrust it into the stone, leaving it alone.

It waited there for years, vaguely aware of the world around it. It saw the strings of fate reach out, as the first of its new bearers was born. It felt them grow, silently watching as it did so. When their path changed, and they needed a weapon, only then did it call out. It guided them to its resting spot, feeling them seize its handle and pull it free.

"Who would leave this here?"

The boy spoke, in absolute wonder. The first sword gave a voiceless laugh, finding joy in being held again.

"My last wielder. I am the Sword of Fates, the First sword forged. By taking me up, you are my first true Bearer."
