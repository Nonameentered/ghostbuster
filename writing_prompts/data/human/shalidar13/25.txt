"So, let me get this straight, you can't die."

I gave a small nod to my companion, before resuming my efforts. We had been tasked with removing a Vine Stalker from the forest, after it had been attacking local villages. Its name came from its bizarre body, made of hundreds of intertwined vines. They were dumb, vicious beasts who acted on instinct.

Of course, hunting one in its lair was suicide. It could meld through plants with ease, letting it strike from all directions. So we had to bait it out, and kill it then. With my... condition, i made the perfect bait. Not that she believed me of course. No-one did at first.

"There, that should do it."

I stood back up, looking at my result. It was a simple tripwire, leading to a net hanging up above. This was one I had acquired years before, during my misspent century of attempted self termination. It was designed to not let anything escape, binding them in place. Once it fell on the beast, I could stab it from the front, whilst Ginra applied one of her many poisons.

"It should, but I'm still having a hard time believing what you say."

I shrugged.

"Listen, it's not my place to make you believe it beforehand. Trust me, this will show you."

She shook her head.

"Whatever, just make sure it gets in the trap."

I grinned at her.

"Oh I will."

She rolled her eyes, scrambling into the treeline. I left her get in position, listening for her whistle. It came in a sharp burst, and I rolled my shoulders.

"Lets do this."

I casually cut my arm, the pain bearly registering. I had died so many times I had grown pretty numb to this sort of thing. I squeezed my blood out, flicking it around. I needed to smell good for it.

It took a few minutes for my scent to fill the air. But soon enough I felt the rumble as something charged towards me. Something big and hungry. It burst into the clearing, snarling. I got my first good look at this beasty, sizing it up.

It was roughly the size of a bear, though wolf in shape. Seven additional vines rose from its back like tentacles, waving through the air. As it got sight of me four came flying down. As I jerked back each wrapped around a limb. I paused, realising what was about to happen.

"This will be new."

Sure enough it pulled. My body strained, bone and muscle locking together. But mere meat could not withstand the power of magical vines. I felt my body tear asunder, legs split individually along with my right arm. My left was dangling from its grasp, holding up the rest of my torso. I felt organs slip out from my new hole, an odd feeling I had to admit.

It hurt. I was surprised at how bad it was, but still not the worst I had felt. That went to the time I decided to jump in front of dragons breath. That sucked. I swung from its grip, wondering what sort of adaptation I would get this time.

It roared, stepping into the clearing. The vine holding my right arm dropped it, wrapping around my torso instead. I assumed it was now going to eat me, when I realised what had changed. I was in pieces, but I could still feel each part. I grinned, pulling my right arm across to the tripwire. I put pressure on it, until it finally released and the net fell.

Ginra appeared, her face pale. But she was still a professional, aiming her arrow at the centre mass. The net enveloped us, and she fired into its core. The beast roared again, sounding almost like a scream and writhing in agony. Unfortunately it pushed me down, running my face into the dirt. Still I yelled, even as dirt hit my tongue.

"Good shot!"

"What?!"

I sighed. She definitely hadn't believed me. But as its movements slowed, I was able to move my detached arm over.

"I said I can't die. This was definitely an interesting experience though."

I managed to remove the crumbling vine from my upper body, picking up my detached limb. I let iut a sharp breath as it reattached, feeling dust and small pebbles slowly forced out.

"I don't suppose you could help me get the rest of my body? I appear to have lost it."

She came into view, wide eyed. I smiled at her, waving at the sudden end to my body.

"I could really use your help. I'm not half the man I used to be."

She blinked, before a slightly hysterical laugh came out. I winced at it. I hoped I hadn't scarred another person. It was getting harder to find people willing to work with me.
