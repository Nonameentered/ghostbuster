"What are you doing, human?"

I froze at the voice. It carried with it the wind in the trees, the fall of blossoms from a tree. I slowly turned to see a figure standing behind me, their body made of millions of petals. They looked through me, and I shivered as I felt their gaze pierce my soul.

"I... I..."

Their body rippled, each petal carried individually by the wind, yet remaining in a cohesive whole. I was immobile as they stopped infront of me, gazing at me with those fathomless eyes.

"You destroy that which is sacred, and I see this was no mere accident."

Behind me stood an ancient tree, which once held a ring of mushrooms growing from it. Now those mushrooms lay in pieces around it, damage I had caused. I found my voice, bowing my head.

"I'm sorry, I had no other idea."

A finger curled beneath my chin, tugging upwards. I gazed into the Fey's face, its expression unreadable.

"No idea? What drives you to incur our anger? Does you mortal mind fail to register the danger you are in?"

I shook, regretting every single one of my choices. I had a gamble to make, one I hoped would pay off.

"I do. I'm sorry but I do. I, I made a deal."

The Fey released me, glancing at the mess I made. I couldn't read what it was feeling, but I could still feel the ever present danger around me. It hissed at me, looking at what I had done.

"Who? Who had you do this?"

I swallowed awkwardly.

"Technically it didn't, but it failed to uphold a bargain... I didn't know how to get it back."

The Fey turned slowly towards me.

"So you sought to anger us? Your thoughts do not track straight."

I gave a nod.

"I thought to repay you by giving you the demons true name."

It stared at me, once again looking through me. A smile crept over its face.

"I see. What is this demons name?"

I swallowed again.

"If I tell you, will you let me go unharmed?"

The Fey nodded.

"I will."

I gave a grateful smile.

"The name is Fekrio Dr'zat-ogl Vewol."

The Fey's smile widened. It took a sinister edge, and I felt my body compress. I was stuck in horror as I felt my body change, becoming smaller and fur covered. A tail formed behind me, exceedingly bushy. I chittered, and the Fey laughed.

"I said unharmed, not unchanged."
