The Beast had fallen, and risen again. Each time it grew stronger, as did the four that stood in its way. They hailed from the four tribes, wielding powers that would be unholy in the wrong hands. But in theirs, they proved potent.

From the humans came the sickly looking one. She seemed to be withered, yet had a strength within few could match. She could cause wounds to seal, or spread with hideous diseases. With her bow she was a force to be reckoned with. Her name was spoken with both hope and fear, the hero Pestilence.

From the orcs came the strongest of their kind. As strong as the others were, he alone was unbeatable in close combat. He would inspire all who fought with him, giving them boosted abilities. His name was chanted when combat came, the simple.name of War.

The dwarves gave the third hero. She was oddly thin, despite her voracious appetite. But she would be generous, ensuring those who fought with her had the energy to continue. She held no weapon, save a set of scales. Yet those they fought have her a wide berth, as she sapped their strength. They name she had was one that was spoke with joy, being Famine.

The elves have the final hero. He was old, but with the spirit of youth. He brought with him spells thay were forgotten as they were cast, boasting terrible power. He needed no weapon nor equipment, being an army in a single body. Despite his power and actions, his name was spoken in fear. The name of Death.

The Beast came again, reborn after its latest defeat. It knew no rest, no joy or peace. It craved death, just for rest. But it was never a permanent resident. It came with the demons that followed it, vile beings of chaos and destruction. They swarmed from the rift that formed as its body reformed.

But once again it stepped from from its home, to see the four before it. It snarled at them, the ones that had temporarily killed it. They were strong, but not strong enough to give it the rest it so desperately craved.

They prepared to fight again, and it roared in anger. The Beast would one day defeat them, and another would take their place. The demons that followed echoed its roar, leaping before it. They would gladly die for it, for outside the negative plane they would not be truly lost. But if they weakened its foes enough, the Beast would be free to wreak the havoc they desired.
