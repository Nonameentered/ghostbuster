"My liege, are you sure this is the wisest course of action?"

I glanced at the monster beside me. Its insectoid features were creased in worry, venom dripping from its maw. Ten legs supported a carapace covered body, beaded with water from the mists.

"I told you before Xecczzzix, this is the only way to ensure our survival."

It hissed, scittering around. I rolled my eyes, looking at the baby in my arms. The small thing was shivering, mouth agap. I was grateful for the spell I had cast earlier, stealing its voice to keep it quiet. After my work was done I would give it back, but until then I could do without its cries.

"So you have said. But we are many, why does our fate rest in the hands of a tiny, delicious child?"

I rolled my eyes.

"That is part of the reason. You think of humans as prey, besides myself of course. But that will lead to your undoing. Try as I might, I will kot be around forever. If I am lost, so too are you.

Beyond that, I know I am strong. As you well know. But I only began my journey when I was already a full grown woman. I lost on the potential of youth, and the surge of strength that comes with it. Imagine how powerful I would be had I been able to start that much younger."

I heard branches creaking, as a furred beast came swinging over. Its arms stretched and squashed as it swung, bending in ways that prevented it from having bones.

"My liege, the defenses hold. But I beg you, move faster, else we are overrun and you are lost. Their men fight with vigour, and they have the power of gods on their side."

I gave it a nod.

"I understand Gogoo, but this cannot be rushed. You must hold the line. Tell the minions it's time to let loose, no holding back."

It roared, pounding its chest and the ground.

"Your will be done."

It swung away, roars echoing in the mist. In the distance I heard a thousand others repeat it. My monsters served me well. I looked to the baby now. It was growing pale. Good. That was what I needed.

"Almost there. Just a few minutes longer."

It's shivers were growing weaker. It's energy was being lost. I could practically see the reaper standing over, waiting. But it would be denied this day.

With care I knelt, placing it on the ground. It would quicken its freezing, but that's what I needed. With arms now free I formed symbols in the air. From my left hand came runes made of light, shining like beacons. From my right came runes of darkness, devouring gazes as you looked on them.

They started to spin, orbiting the baby. I grew lost in the flow, adding more and more power to this ritual. I could feel the divine gazes on me, as I prepared to break the laws of nature once more. But they could not act beyond their warriors, a fact I was relying on.

At the peak, the baby grew still. My ritual activated, wrapping the escaping soul in gains of gold and shadow, drawing it back into the flesh. The sounds around me grew dim, a roaring taking over. I wove the stream, wrapping it in intricate lines through the body. I gave the baby power I could only dream of.

The roaring quietened, air falling still. I felt a crack in my mind, and the silence spell I had cast earlier broke. That stillness was soon lost, as cries rang out. I grinned, picking up the cold baby, cuddling them close.

"It's OK. You did it. You are my daughter now."
