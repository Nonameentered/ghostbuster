It had been a long time since I had been given a vessel. It had to be very specifically selected and prepared, for few could withstand the ground work that preceded my possession. Runes and glyphs had to be carved in flesh, bone and organ.

Even then, if they survived, I would not be held for long. Mortal bodies were not designed to hold a divine form within. I would soon burned through them, leaving them empty husks by the end. I liked being in such a form, but I hated the cost.

Still, some people tried to summon me. I was a god of chaos, something which people craved. Don't get me wrong, I loved chaos. I loved breaking down the walls of order. But it had to serve a purpose. Chaos for chaos sake was madness. Chaos for helping others, that's what I liked. I liked people who asked me to help, or who helped me when I asked for it.

I found myself drawn down, a new vessel prepared. I knew a cult of mine had been preparing one, but I paid it little mind. I was more focused on the protests against the arrest of some political figures. They were trying to do the right thing, and had been seen as dangerous. A few thugs later and they were imprisoned. I wanted the protests to grow, become chaotic, and break down the corrupt lawmakers who took them in.

As I was drawn down, I let the flow take over. As I filled it, I could tell this body was stronger than the others. Even as its delicate nerves began to burn, they regrew. I smiled with my new mouth, reading what this was. This was a body with power, one of those atypical humans. Presumably with rapid regeneration, a perfect host.

"Oh Chaos Bringer, we submit ourselves to you, and grant you this body to use as you see fit."

I laughed, feeling its muscles move. It was a strange feeling, having flesh where once was mere mist. A solidity that I often lacked. I pulled myself off of the table, and listened to the voice of its previous owner in my head.

*Bringer? This... this is your doing?*

I knew this well. This was someone I had dealt with before. Someone I trusted, and respected. With a thought I summoned a broken mirror, my stolen face peering out from a dozen shards.

Regen looked back at me. The same dark brown skin, with runes carved into it. Even his regrowth couldn't beat runes carved with my blessed knives. My joy was wiped away, replaced with anger.

*Regen, I am sorry. I didn't know they had used you as a vessel.*

His thoughts echoed in our shared brain, truth the only thing allowed.

*I understand Bringer. This isn't your sort of thing. But I want you out. I want my body back.*

I nodded his head, letting the mirror vanish. Rage filled eyes sought out the cultist leader, who stumbled back at my gaze.

"M-my master. Do-do you dislike this vessel?"

"No."

The single word shook the room. I heard the panicked squeaks of rats as they fled. With a snap of my wrist the leader was held aloft, arms twisted behind his back.

"This vessel belongs to a friend. AND YOU THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO FORCE HIM INTO THIS?!"

My anger extinguished every light, replaced instead by an ominous red glow from below. I had never been so angry, even back when I experienced my first betrayal.

"YOU ARE LUCKY THAT I DO NOT REMOVE EVERY SPECK OF YOUR EXISTENCE! No, that wouldn't do at all."

I dropped him to the ground, cracking Regen's neck. I felt his mind wince, as he felt the razors edge of my thoughts.

"No. Instead you are going to assist me in undoing what you have done. You, I, and everyone in the room will figure out how to make me leave, **without** killing him. That, or you will see just what pure chaos feels like."
