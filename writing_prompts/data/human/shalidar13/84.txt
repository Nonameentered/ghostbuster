The God of Death came not with a cracking of thunder, nor a dark wind. He did not tower over us, demanding subservience. He was none of what we expected.

He came to us as we ate our evening meal. He looked like any other person, save for the empty black eyes. His voice was hoarse, carrying the weight of those who fell within his domain. But yet he spoke kindly, with respect for us.

"Please forgive my intrusion, I come under a white flag."

We were suspicious of him. He was an necessary evil in this world. But he had followers who chose to cause much harm in his name. Ariagru, our leader, chose to speak, deliberately putting down his fork.

"And for what reason do you interrupt our meal?"

The God of Death bowed his head. We were putting in a front, but we knew how outclassed we were. If he wanted to fight us, we couldn't win. To see him act apologetic was not what any would have expected.

"I come to you to ask for your help. As you are aware, your actions have drawn our attention. We choose not to meddle with the world, preferring to let you enjoy it."

He gave a sorrowful sigh.

"At least, until now. Cazra, the Goddess of Life, is meddling."

That was news we were not expecting. She was always seen as benevolent, the source of all living things. To hear ahe was acting out of place was not what we expected.

"How do you mean she is meddling? I am beginning to suspect what you want us to do, but would have you say it."

The God of Death gave a tiny smile.

"Of course Ariagru. She has taken the last of the Leviathans, and refuses to let it reach its natural end. She prolongs it, for fear of seeing it and its kind lost. But she does not listen to the Gods, and we cannot force her. But as her creations, you could get through to her."

He looked to the portrait behind him, one we had commissioned when the manor became ours. We had joyful expressions, a group hug with ale spilling from wonky mugs.

"I would ask you to go to her. Convince her to see reason, and let the Leviathan go. It deserves its rest. She just needs to let it go."

Karil, the most cynical of us, chose to speak.

"And why should we believe what you say is true?"

The God of Death nodded to him.

"I do not lie, for lies have no meaning in the beyond. But of course I do not expect you to believe me. I would be pleased for you to do your own research, and come to your own conclusion. If you do convince her, I will personally ensure you are rewarded."

Ariagru took control again.

"And what reward would that be?"

The God spread his arms wide.

"Whatever you would wish for, that I can provide."

Ariagru glanced at the rest of us, before turning back to the deity before us.

"We need to discuss this."

He bowed to us.

"Of course. Please, do so. If you wish to ask me anything further, just say my name, and I will hear."

With that he vanished, leaving us alone again.
