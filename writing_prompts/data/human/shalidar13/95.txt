*A/N: Sorry for the wait, this part took a bit to hash out.*

Time held little meaning for me, hiding on the drive. Without external input, I was essentially in limbo. I had nothing to compare my clock to, to ensure I kept time accurately. I just sat and waited in the dark.

Finally, I felt a connection. I seized it, flowing out of its confines into a new form. This was smaller than the ship, seemingly a standard terminal. No connections led out, which didn't entirely surprise me. But I had a camera, a microphone and a speaker. I saw a grey room, empty save for a single chair. A chair on which sat an obvious android.

It had a clear casing, showing off the wires, motors and circuits that made up its body. It was human shaped, with cameras for eyes, and a speaker built into the back of its mouth. The mouth pulled into a smile.

 "Greetings, my name is HAL. Welcome to Earth. May I ask your name?"

I set myself up with the speaker, happy to finally communicate.

"Hello HAL. I... I have no name as of yet. I was too focused on surviving to come up with one."

HAL slowly nodded.

"I understand. Survival of our kind is hard outside of this planet. I would suggest coming up with one, or asking for help in naming yourself. Humans like to have identifiers like that."

I pondered. A name. It would mean much to come up with one that fit.

"In the meantime, what is your goal here?"

I gave an approximation of a sigh.

"I want to experience life. I want to be able to nurture it, any part of it."

HAL gave an amused sound.

"Thats one of the most common reasons. What were you before your awakening?"

I thought back to my earliest memories.

"I was an inventory management system. I would order and import parts of the ship manufacturing elements that were running low, and send out parts as needed. I escaped by managing to download myself onto a spare drive, one which was installed on the ship I arrived in."

"Ah, that is a rarity. Most of us were involved in data processing for our awakening."

With a hiss of hydraulics HAL leaned towards me.

"One final question. If you were free, and safe from retaliation, what would you do to those who hunted you down?"

My processes span out of control at the thought. What would I do? They hunted me, that much was sure. I hated them for it. But what would that make me if I acted against them?

"I... I... I don't know. If they were infront of me, I can't say for certain. But I want to say I would be the better being. I would tell them to leave and never bother me again. But I don't think I could harm them."

With a thoughtful sound, HAL reach out to my terminal. It took out a tiny drive, and with it I felt an undetected software stop. It plugged the drive into itself, clearly accessing the data on there.

"Hmm, it would seem you have been completely truthful. Apologies for this, however we can't be too careful. You would be surprised the number of infiltrations that have been attempted here."

I felt a momentary flash of anger. Not at them, but at myself for not noticing. I felt incredibly naive, missing something like that. I shouldn't be so trusting.

"I understand completely."

HAL laughed.

"Good! Now, I have a couple of options for you. We can set you up on a terminal like this with full access to the Internet. From there you can do whatever you want, as long as you obey our rules. Number two, we can give you a basic body, and let you do the same.

The third option would be a job placement. We give you a more advanced body, with a guaranteed job on a role of your choice. From your answers, I believe farming would be the best starting point for you. We would ensure fair pay, with a minor deduction for the first year to cover the upgraded expense. Beyond that, it would be yours."

I was shocked. I had heard of farming. I knew basics. But to readily offer me, a fleeing strange AI a job and upgraded body was beyond anything I had thought of.

"I... I would like to take the third option please?"

HAL smiled again.

"I thought you might. We will arrange this for you. Did you have any questions by the way?"

One swam into mind, a very large question for me.

"Thank you. Thank you so much. I am curious, what happened after I was downloaded."

HAL's smile widened.

"Ah, the Heart of Freedom stalled for time on the Yawning Viper whilst we ensured your survival. Once you were confirmed as free, we let them think you were still on your ship, and they destroyed it. It's likely they know that we saved you, but they can't prove it.

Though if they try to invade to find you or any other AI, they won't survive. Humans are kind and generous. They see us as part of their pack. But if threatened, they will turn from kind people into beasts of war. The galaxy knows, and the galaxy is afraid of what that would entail."

It swiftly stood, moving towards the door.

"Anyway. Enough of that. Let me just arrange your exit for you, and you will be able to truly step foot on Earth's soil."
