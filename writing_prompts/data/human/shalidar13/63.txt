Yet another day, yet another mission. I sat in the back of the carrier, fiddling with one of the tubes on my flamethrower. I knew it well, having used it hundreds of times before. The last time I felt the stream had just a little less pressure. Still enough to work, but not good enough for me.

"Alright everyone, listen up."

I looked up from my work, as Cap drew our attention. He was the leader, one we trusted with our lives. He glanced over everyone to make sure we were paying attention, before continuing.

"You've all read the briefing, but in case you forgot, or didn't bother to pay attention, let me go over it again. We are deploying to a newly formed camp of the Restless. Initial scans show no civilian population in the area, but it is close to a leyline nexus. Numbers are estimated to be nearing one hundred, but their tents are large, so it could be out by a significant factor.

This is a standard kill and cleanse operation. But no relaxing alright? Just one slip up could cost you your kind, if they get close enough to convert. Hawk, Knife, Red-eye, Sneaks, Zoom and myself are Kill. Flash, Oops and Jolly are cleansing. You know your usual pair up, so stick to it."

I nodded, seeing everyone else copying. A glance showed my pair, Sneaks and Red-eye, preparing themselves. Another one told me Flash and Jolly had checked over their equipment, and were ready. I stopped fiddling with mine, knowing that it had been given a full check over after our last mission.

Cap moved over to the rear of the carrier, thumping it. It opened up to reveal the rocky valley below, where the latest camp had appeared. He held up three fingers, swiftly counting down before jumping. We quickly followed, leaping into the air. Below us was a ramshackle camp, with faded, worn tents.

We fell fast. Phase one was always the shock entrance. They probably expected us to follow civilian directions, using parachutes, or maybe a slowfall token. But that wasn't how we worked.

Seconds before I hit the ground, I spun in the air, pointing my feet down. They hit the ground, and their enchantments activated, taking the energy from my fall. I didn't even need to bend my knees, hoisting my flamethrower. The air suddenly filled with cracks as the Kill pairs moved in.

I jogged to catch up, turning on my pilot flame. Already I saw a pile of three bodies, faces caught in surprise. Holes in their chests and head told me they had been on the end of one of the Kill pairs. Still, I kept my distance, pointing the end of my flamethrower at them. I depressed the trigger, feeling the familiar rush and hearing the roar, as orange and blue flames vomited over them.

They didn't move, as cleansing fire consumed their bodies. I knew they weren't necessarily dead, being one of the more persistent form of undead. But those shots would keep them bound until either removed or they were destroyed. I kept my eye out, following behind Sneaks and Red-eye.

They were seamless, moving from cover to cover, sweeping everything as they moved. If they saw a Restless they took it out, leaving the body for me. I heard the other teams move as well, as we moved towards the centre in a three pronged assault.

It was a familiar scene for us. Panicked Restless coming out of tents, only to be shot down. I would cover them in flames, letting it burn them clean. Then we would move again.

It didn't take long to clean the camp out. I watched Sneaks and Red-eye open up tents, sweeping them. Once it was clear I was waved forwards, giving it a brief walk over with fire. Once it was burning merrily, we moved onto the next. Methodically we removed every trace of them, meeting back up at the centre.

Cap gave a grim smile, surrounded by smoke and burning bodies.

"Good job everyone. Pickup is on its way."
