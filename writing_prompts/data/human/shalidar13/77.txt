The End had always existed. It was a dark presence over all of the Versal kind, as they created infinitely large places. It would strike with no rhyme or reason, manifesting itself in their creations. It would twist and break them, bending their laws until the infinite collapsed, and their creation was lost.

But it was no mindless destroyer. The End loved its work. It would taunt the Versal it had chosen, as it ruined what they had made. It would appear within, talking in any language it chose. Sometimes it lay in wait, spreading its agenda like a virus until the inhabitants did its work for it. Other times it just came through as a ruinous form, laying waste to whatever lay in its path.

Sometimes the Versal would try to scheme against it. They made traps, trying to contain it. It would laugh, and rip through its prison. They tried to destroy the prison with it inside. That would work, until The End pulled its way out of whoever destroyed it, laughing all the same.

They sometimes spoke to their creations. They hoped life they made could fight back against it. They gave them power and strength to do so. The End would love the fight, slaughtering them without effort, before ending their home.

It was an endless cycle of destruction and rebirth. Life was cultivated like plants, pushed into interesting shapes and choices. Until it was lain to waste, and new life borne from.the ashes of a destroyed infinite.

The End chose another one. This time just a single infinite. It slid in as it had done countless times before, and would do countless times again. This one was full of individual points of light, with life supporting rocks floating around them. It laughed, addressing the mournful Versal.

"What a quaint little universe! I can't wait to wreck it!"

It flowed across the universe like a dark wave. But this time it did not want to destroy it immediately. It wanted to see the life fight itself. It sought out minds, ones to poison and turn to darker emotions. It would create a universal war first, and enjoy the show.
