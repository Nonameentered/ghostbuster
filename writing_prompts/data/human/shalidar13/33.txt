Since time immemorial have there been three levels of existence. The first is the formation of all that is good. Its denizens were born from light, their will the mightiest of all. In their presence, deceit is revealed, truth stands strong, and bonds are strengthened.

Their counterpart came from the darkest depths of evil. Its land is twisted and burned. Vile creatures stalk it, terrorising any who venture near. Their bodies are the strongest of all that live. They delight in pain and chaos, twisting words to break relationships apart.

In between these two extremes lies a midground. It grew from the essence of both, influenced by their differing values. In this was birthed the first soul, the first truly free being. It gave rise to others, those who would live and die. Their actions, and those of the world around them linked them close to one or other of the levels. When their bodies passed, so too would they pass to the level that resonated with them most of all.

These souls empowered each other level. The heavens grew brighter, as its denizens threw lavish attention to the souls. The hells craved the feeling of control over them. They twisted and broke those cursed to their realm, birthing more monstrous beings.

The first soul noticed this. In its unique position, it could move between the other realms freely. It saw the lush fields of the heavens, with ever singing birds and eternal fruit bearing trees. It experienced the savage landscape of hell, with rivers of molten rock and metal. And it saw both as places worth conquering.

It made an army of souls, ones to wage war on both. With its unique position it could simply grow new soldiers, its level unable to sustain any other beings for a long time. In turn, the campaigns harmed both heaven and hell, brutally cutting them down whilst it's power grew. It tore the light and dark, using shreds to empower itself further.

In a desperate ploy, heaven and hell set aside their eternal feud. They formed a united front, catching the First Soul off guard. Its armies were routed, itself captured. But in its uniqueness it could not be killed.

A prison was made for it. Hell formed an infinitly large shifting labyrinth, filled with traps to contain it. Heaven created an impenetrable barrier, one that nothing but pure good could ever cross. The entrance was forgotten, all traces of the First Soul removed from existence. With its army lost, the truce fell, hell and heaven warring again.

Millennia later, a newly formed devil explored the deepest recesses of reality. It came across an ancient door, a clear impossibility in its view. All of history was recorded, branded into its brain upon creation. And yet there was nothing about a clearly crafted door.

A young angel came upon the devil in its own exploration. But in place of battle, they chose to examine the door together. To their surprise, they found the lock required both an infernal and a celestial touch. Together they opened it, curiosity outweighing caution.

As it opened, the barrier blazed before them. The angel touched it, feeling its power. It could tell it was containing something. But it was archaic, and easily dispelled with the changes since its creation. Beyond it, they saw the ever shifting labyrinth.

As the devil approached it, the labyrinth reacted. It formed a straight line, a figure appearing at its end. It walked towards them, smiling almost kindly. They let it approach, burning with questions. It came into arms reach, moving with a flash and grasping their throats.

They struggled against the First Soul's grasp, its smile turning into a mocking sneer.

"Finally, free after so long. Thank you. I will be sure to pass on your regards."

It slowly crushed their essence out, feeding on the shreds that remained. It had failed in its misson once before. It would not do so again. All would fall under its rule.
