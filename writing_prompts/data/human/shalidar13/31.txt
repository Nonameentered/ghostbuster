I felt the clouds part above me as my prayer finished. A wave of warmth filled my body, the touch of a god on me. I smiled, pride and awe bubbling up inside. It was a rarity for a prayer to be granted directly. The warmth made me one of the Answered, a champion of the gods.

I hefted my sword, my heart calmed. With this blessing I would not die today, I was sure. I would become a terror on the battlefield. I was sure I would help rout them, with a supernaturally sharp blade and untiring muscles. My armour would be impenetrable.

I joined my comrades, the core of our military strength. We wore chainmail, a few having saved enough to buy some plate on top. But as strong as we were, we weren't an army. I looked beyond to the wider camp, where I saw the main infantry. Commoners the lot of them, scared of what was to come. We had tried to train them before hand, but we didn't have nearly enough time.

Beyond was an expanse of open land, with the plumes of smoke from our enemy's camp rising into the air. I knew they would be much the same, a large number of commoners with a core few knights. There would be a lot of death of untrained soldiers on either side. But there were always more to recruit.

With a salute I marched off, ready to begin the battle. As I moved, the commoners assigned to me noticed my movement. I could see their faces paling, eyes tightening in determination. They rushed to prepare, forming up around me. I smiled at them, giving them a salute in equal to my comrades. Whilst untrained, they had the hearts of warriors, something I could respect.

Cries filled the air, as our force collided with theirs. Almost immediately screams rang out, the first blood spilled in seconds. I gave my own cry, leading my commoners behind me. I swung my sword, feeling it effortlessly pass through the torso of the poor sap infront of me. But they did not fall. They did not bleed. They looked as shocked as I did.

I swung again to the same result. Something was horribly wrong. I had been Answered. Why couldn't I fight? Fear rose in me, it bitter taste something I hadn't truly felt in a long time. My commoners didn't notice, stabbing with thier cheap spears. I kicked my foe away, getting space as I stepped back.

A closer scream drew my attention. One of my people staggered back, blood pouring from their chest. I moved infront of them, letting my armour block spear thrusts whilst I focused on the man. His eyes were glazed, and he thrashed around.

"Hold still!"

I gave him a hard slap, trying to make him focus. He gave a gasp, looking down at a sudden glow on his chest. It was matched with an orange glow on my hands, as I felt a rush from me. To our amazement his wound sealed, body unmarred by even a scar.

I made the connection instantly, having spent much time reading about Answered when training. The reason I couldn't harm anyone properly. I hadn't been blessed by Hadro, the god of war, but instead by Hodra, god of healing. I nodded to myself, giving a tiny smile at the now healed man. He returned it, as I looked up and bellowed out.

"Ebra Unit! Fall back!"

To my relief the obeyed, stepping back with me. I knew like this I was no good on the front line. But just behind it I would make a hell of a difference. I waited for them to pull back to me, as one of my comrades teams filled the gap. They trusted me implicitly, as I trusted them. If I were pulling my guys back so quickly, I had to have a good reason.

"Change of plan. Guard me, we are going on the move. If you see someone hurt, point them out to me. If you see a pile of our soldiers fallen, point them out."

I raised my sword, noticing how blue waves ran along it's length.

"I have been Answered by Hodra. I cannot harm, but I can heal. If you fall, I will bring you back. If you are hurt, I shall undo it."

They cheered, relief on their faces pushing past the terror of death. I wasn't a terror on the battlefield as I suspected I would be. But I would still be a key player.
