The sun was bright, and I merrily trudged along my way. The many pots on my back rattled and banged, a parade for me. I grinned to myself, thoughts of food compelling me. The little plants that made meat taste strange but good. The bigger plants that cooked like meat.

I saw someone ahead, one who glittered in the sun. I wiped my chest, making sure no remnants of my morning meal remained. The small people liked to be neat, that much I knew. Strange custom, that. Surely it was better to show you liked food by letting it run down, so you could taste again later?

I shook my head. No matter. I must make good impression. A flash shot up in my mind, the gift my last stranger had given me. It was a small hat, made for their heads. It was tall and round, like a trunk. But it was white, and folded weird. It would make me seem different to my non-cooking family. I hoped it would be enough. I hated fighting.

I struggled to get it place on my head. The wind tried to blow it off, so I kept a hand on it. I needed something to hold it on. Maybe this small person could help me with that. I hoped so. So many started off mean, but they changed their tune after a while.

"I don't want to fight you ogre. Please return home."

They shouted at me, keeping a hand on their sharp stick. I held up one hand, remembering it was a sign of peace for them. I grumbled out my words, focusing hard to make them understandable.

"Grumbo no wish to fight. Grumbo going to Capy-tul to cook. Grumbo heard of cooking competition."

The person stood there, looking up at me. Their voice came again, disbelief evident.

"Cooking? Are you saying you're a chef?"

I nodded happily. That is what they had called me before. Chef!

"Yes! Grumbo good chef. Make boar taste good with little plants."

Their small hand reached up to scratch their head. I grinned at them, carefully moving my hand away from the tiny hat. I kept it nearby for when the wind came, to catch it.

"An ogre chef? That's... OK. Fine. Listen I hate to break the bad news to you but they aren't going to just let you in."

I frowned. The others had been encouraging when they left. Why was this one not?

"Why not? Grumbo no hurt people. Grumbo feed people. Make people strong like Grumbo."

The person sighed. They squeezed the front on their face.

"Listen... you're an ogre. Ogres terrify people. They hear of how you like to eat us. You go in, you are just going to get slaughtered."

I pouted.

"But... Grumbo promise to no hurt."

They sighed again.

"I can see that. But they won't... unless..."

Their eyes went vague. I shifted nervously. Something about this person gave me pause. I wasn't a good fighter, I knew that. But this person was completely out of my league.

"Ok. I have actually been trying to prove for a while beings like ogres and goblins aren't all evil. Some of you are genuinely nice. So, I can help you get in. You just have to promise to be on your best behaviour ok?"

I nodded, before wincing as my hat fell. I tried to catch it, but the cloth was too small for me. My heart sank as it fell to the dirt. I had tried so hard to keep it clean. But before it touched the person darted forwards, catching it. I grinned at them.

"Grumbo thanks you."

"You're welcome I guess. My names Reolia by the way."

Reolia held up my hat, smiling.

"But first I think we need to make this fit you better."
