I didn't know anything beyond violence and death. From the second I was born, I was trained and perfected. My fate was sealed before I had even taken my first breath.it was all down to something beyond my control, being my parents.

My mother was a fallen angel, one who had held the most divine power, but left it all to wall the world of mortals. She had joined a group of peacekeepers, with an oath to ensure their civilisation of mixed races survived. It was there She met my father, one even rarer than my mother. He was a risen demon, who had left the infernal flames to see life for himself.

They did not have access to their full powers, but they still had the potential. That was passed onto me in equal parts, giving me an impossible pool of power to draw from. It gave me strength of both body and mind beyond any other, making me perfectly suited for moulding.

I was trained alongside the other firstborns, those given up to protect the realm. But where they just learned, I was changed. Every part of my body was analysed, with weakness cut out and replaced. I knew no different, my body changed by others choices. I had no say, and no reference to understand.

By the time I was ten, I could easily beat grown men. When puberty struck, I had killed dozens of monsters. At my naming ceremony on my seventeenth birthday, I was an army contained in a single body. I was exactly who they wanted me to be.

I spent my days stalking the world. I heard when monsters attacked, and hunted them down. Each one was killed, and I delivered their bodies back to my home. They would see if anything could be used to help me further. If there was, I would undergo surgery to be upgraded. It was simple and effective.

I was on the trail of a Skeletal Hydra when I found something I didn't expect. I had been given a degree of foresight, allowing surprise to be lost on me. But I did not see the hut in it, only when I stumbled upon it. Curiosity got the better of me, letting me approach.

The door opened before I arrived, and a woman stepped out. I felt her mind brush mine, but the upgrades kept me secure. Her smile was bewitching, though it could not charm me to lose my mind.

"Welcome, Son of the Opposites."

She spoke with authority. I narrowed my eyes, mildly disturbed at how I couldn't see what she would do. It was a crutch I had grown dependent on, and I now realised my mistake.

"Who are you?"

She smiled wider.

"I am known by many names. But you can call me Eva."

I could tell she was strong. I suspected I was stronger. They would want me to bring her back, and apply her strength to my own. But doubt crept into my mind. It made sense. But she was different. She knew what I was.

"Eva. Why can't I See you?"

She gave a laugh.

"The power of foresight. A formidable strength you have there. But I'm afraid it's not all powerful. I just ensured my path was hidden from such things."

I kept my hand out, ready to summon my Formless Weapon.

"Why? And how do you know who I am?"

Her smile dimmed a little.

"I was once like you. Forced down a path in life. But whilst yours is the path of blood and violence, mine was the path of deceit and prediction. I saw you, another soul bound by chains that could not be broken before they were in place. I was lucky enough to realise and escape mine, but you are clearly not so lucky.

If you want, I can help you break free, and make your own choices. Be the man you want to be, bot the one you are told to be. Do you always want to be a killer, or do you want to see what life is truly like?"
