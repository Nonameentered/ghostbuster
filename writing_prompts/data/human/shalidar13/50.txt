"-team has requested vast amounts of basic materials for genetic growth. We have been lenient thus far, but you have not yet provided any results. In fact, according to your own records, you have only had one subject!"

I yawned as a voice disturbed me. Glancing at a wall clock, I saw it was gone two o'clock. The surprise cut through my drowsiness, as I realised I had overslept again. It was probably the most aggravating side effect of my treatment, a constant need for sleep.

I sprang up, heading into my bathroom. I didn't have time to shower, but I I could at least freshen myself up. My business was quick, even with my changed body. I gave myself a once over, pleased that I still looked fabulous. I rushed out, snapping up the pair of apples I had left out before. With a couple of bites I devoured them, going into the next room.

This was a large space, filled with all sorts of wonderful machines. I had been on most of them multiple times, as we monitored my vitals throughout this process. Of course, some were now useless, not designed to handle my new form.

I looked at the blacked out windows. I could hear the voices in there, the ones that had disturbed me.

"Where is your subject? You promised us results, yet here you are, making excuses! Do you have any idea the issues you are giving us?! This is a privilege you have, to work in this area of research. I'm beginning to feel like we need to look at revoking it."

I cleared my throat, leaning over a desk on the side. The smaller buttons were hard to see in the dark, but we wanted to make a grand reveal. I tapped one, muttering as it just woke up the screen. It was locked. Of course. And it would obviously be very easy to unlock.

I was saved from frustration by a nudge. Looking up I saw Dr Javes smiling. Her eyes were bright with excitement, and a little jealousy at my body.

"Hey sleepy head. Ready for the show?"

I grinned, hissing back.

"Of course. Let's blow their socks off."

She grinned, the jealousy fading. We had a bit of a rivalry, but I considered her one of my best friends. She took her spot, unlocking the device. She hit a button, a faint buzz telling me the intercom was active.

"Apologies for the delay, our test subject had a bit of a rough start."

The cheeky cow. I poked my tongue out at her, before schooling my expression and standing tall in the dead centre of the room.

"We are ready when you are."

I heard the lead over the comm as well, relief evident in his voice.

"Thank you Yasmin. Mr Welton, you wish to see our results? Well then, let me introduce you to Dr Nicole Pire, our volunteer."

The shutters over the windows open. I could see our lead, Dr Firell, standing with a serious looking man in a suit. He glowered at me, before I twitched, and shock blossomed over his features.

"We chose to look beyond simple modification. Granting the human body increased strength and speed. Toughening skin, and improving internal processes. All noble pursuits. But we wanted more. Dr Pire came up with the idea on a complete species change. And as you can see, the results speak for themselves."

I loomed up, letting my black scales glint in the light. My tail was curved to one side, the tip twitching. I stretched new muscles, great wings extending out from either side. I stood there, as the first human turned dragon, and grinned. Firell turned to the suited man, a satisfied smirk on his face.

"So, do you think the board will still revoke our privilege?"
