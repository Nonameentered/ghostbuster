"I know you are hiding there."

Angrus shook in fear. The last time he had heard that voice was in agony, with a knife in their back. A cowards way to take down the greatest of them all, as they could not beat him in a straight fight.

"Angrus, I know it's you. You are still as sneaky as ever, but I can still recognise your life force."

He swallowed, before stepping out from behind the tree. Sure enough, before him was a familiar figure. He was of average size, with defined muscles. His black hair was in a messy ponytail, and he wore simple, mudstained working clothes. His brown ryes flickered, irises turning gold.

"F-Faulil... I... I thought you were dead."

Faulil gave a grim smile.

"Don't beat around the bush. You thought you had killed me."

Angrus's face drained of colour. But even as he stepped away, he felt a cold shiver run down his spine. A new figure stepped up to Faulil, lightly resting her hand on his shoulder. Her dark skin was an opposite to his, though her body had a similar level of muscle. The Dark Elf gave a small smirk at their guests reaction.

"I didn't think we were expecting visitors. Dear, did you?"

Faulil shook his head.

"Nor me Sila. Still, I think we had better take this back home. Follow me Angrus."

There was an edge to his voice, one that allowed no argument. Like a fly in a web, Angrus felt trapped. For a moment he wanted to run, but a look from Sila stopped those thoughts.

They led him through the woods, clearly unconcerned at exposing their backs to him. He was fantastic at sneaking, and attacking when people least expected. But he was well aware of the gap between him and them. If he attacked first, they would wipe the floor with him. If they chose to attack, he could only give up and hope for a quick death.

After a few long minutes, they came to a small hut against the base of a cliff. He could hear water running nearby, and a few wolves lounged around.

"Welcome to our home. Sila, could you entertain him a moment whilst I fetch some chairs."

She smiled at him, giving a quick peck on his cheek.

"Of course not."

Faulil smiled back as he entered the hut. As the door closed, Sila turned on Angrus.

"Let me be quite clear. If you dare attack, or do anything to think you mean to cause us harm, I will make you suffer."

He knew she wasn't lying. He had seen first hand what she was capable of. On some dark nights, the memories of what he had seen still haunted him. He swallowed awkwardly, stammering in his response.

"I-I swear I m-mean no h-harm."

"Good."

She fell silent, staring at him like a hawk. The rising tension was disturbed as Faulil came out, holding three chairs. He carefully set them down, two beside each other with the third directly opposite.

"Now, let's talk."
