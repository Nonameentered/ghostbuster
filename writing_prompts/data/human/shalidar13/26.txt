I had a lonely childhood. Sure, I had a roof over my head, and food on the table. But I was given mere scraps of affection from my own mother. She did her best for my brothers and sister, but for me I was more of an afterthought.

I understood it a bit more as I grew up. I was the result of a fling. The others were intended by mum and my step 
dad. He did his best, stepping up for me and mum when they got together. He never demanded I call him dad or force me to obey him. But his love for me was vastly different to his related children. But mum always seemed to regret having me.

I looked out for my siblings, being the older sister they needed. If they had night terrors I would try to calm them. When mum needed a break I played with them. I loved them, and they did love me. I didn't have to help, it was made abundantly clear. But I felt the need to make sure they felt the love I never really did.

It was the night of my seventeenth birthday. We had had a small meal to celebrate my coming of age. I was considered an adult now in the eyes of the law. With it I had my first glass of wine, finally tasting alcohol for the first time. It wasn't bad, but I didn't get why people raved about it.

I went up to my room, feeling quite happy. Gemma had been telling me a story about how her friend was fed up with bullies, and took maters into her own hands. I had tried to act disapprovingly, but could help but laugh at her sheer audacity.

I frowned as I looked at my bed. I hadn't made it, but that wasn't anything new. Instead I saw a small envelope resting on it. It was made of thick white paper, with a single word on the front.

>Donna

I picked it up, curious. I didn't recognise the handwriting, and didn't know how it had gotten in here. But I paid that little mind, choosing instead to open it.

Inside I found a card, made of good quality card. The front had an image of a dozen black roses, set on a soft green background. I breathed in, surprised to find that it had the smell of roses with it. I opened it up, reading the short message inside.

>Happy Birthday!

>Love Dad

I smiled, before blinking and freezing. After blinking the letters changed, becoming strange glyphs. They has been inked in red liquid, something I couldn't help but think of as blood. But even though it had changed, I knew exactly what it said. The message hadn't changed, just the language. A language I somehow knew.

I looked it over, seeing no other markings. I was worried now. Changing letters written in blood. A card that had been snuck into my room. A language I had never learned but understood. It didn't make sense.

My first thought was to hide it. Mum would probably push it under the rug, and my stepdad wouldn't know what to do. He would try, but he was a simple man, as he liked to call himself. This was something like magic, the sort of thing that didn't happen to an ordinary city girl like me.

But my gut said otherwise. It said to take it to mum. This would be something she would know about. She could help me. I decided to trust it, looking for her. I found her in the garden, sitting on her old chair and looking into the distance.

"Mum."

She tore her eyes away from it with difficulty, looking up at me.

"What is it Donna?"

I held out the card. She glanced at it, before frowning. Her hand reached out, and I passed it over. She looked at the inside, before sighing.

"I knew this would happen."

I crouched down next to her.

"What do you mean?"

She gave another sigh, passing it back.

"I guess you should know now. The short story is that I met your dad when I was going through some bad times. He helped me out, but in return I had to give him something. He wanted a child."

I felt a lump in my throat.

"He... wanted you to have me? Why?"

Mum sighed again, handing the card back to me.

"Infernal creatures aren't everlasting. They need heirs to take up their power. He needed one, and I was in a position to give him what he wanted."

I looked at her, seeing the shame on her face.

"I'm... the daughter of a demon?"

She gave a small nod.

"Yes. And now he wants you."
