With a determined heart I marched towards my challenge. I had passed all previous tests set before me, giving both heart and soul to become a member of the Noble Order. All I had dreamed of was becoming a knight, a goal that was now in my grasp.

All I had to do was find the dragon that lurked at the borders of our fair nation. I had been told to challenge it, and that how I faired would decide if I could join the Order or not. All I had been told about the challenge was to expect the unexpected, and not seek to destroy the dragon itself.

I searched high and low for it, for this beast was clever. It moved often, a seemingly random pattern. But it was always on the outskirts, going no further away nor further inwards. I spent days searching for any sign of it, talking with any who might have seen it.

Finally, I found a merry gentleman who had clearly been on the mead. He slurred as he placed a heavy hand on my shoulder, grinning.

"You'sh, you'sh want the dragon? He'sh... that way."

The drunk pointed behind him, before staggering away. I wished him well, following his directions. There were enough people following his path that I felt comfortable letting him wander. Besides, my challenge was near.

By continuing to track his path, I found a strange building. It's edges were worn, but nit from weathering. It was more like it had been carried and placed multiple times, a bizarre idea. Nothing could lift a building like that. I glanced at the sign, and felt my heart sink. It showed a wall, with the snout of a dragon peeking round. Below it was the name, The Lurking Dragon.

The drunk probably had no idea what was looking for. He probably only heard dragon, and thought I wanted a tavern. I sighed, before steeling myself. The dragon wasn't here, but maybe there would be a rumor. At very least, I could get a warm bed for the night.

I opened the door, feeling warm air rush out. It carried with it the smell of roasting meats, fine wine and ale, and a hint of smoke. I breathed it in with a smile, looking around the interior. It was a large, open room, with at least two dozen tables and booths around the main area. At the back a pair of staircases rose up either side of the bar, reaching a balcony set with yet more chairs. Many were filled, with merry laughter and conversation filling the sound.

But to me it faded away, as my eyes settled on the bar. It was a wide, long counter, with an abundance of space behind it. This space was filled with a single, giant creature. Its body was thick and scaled, a ridge of horns running down its back. Its nostrils flared with embers, snout split to reveal a large set of teeth. I stared at a dragon. Not just any dragon. As it turned its head I saw the defining feature, it's missing left eye.

"Ah, the squire finally arrives."

It's voice was at a normal volume. But yet I could hear it clearly over the hubbub, and it grinned at me.

"Welcome to the Lurking Dragon. Are you here for your challenge?"

I nodded, slowly walking towards it. As I did I noted the faint daze over everyone's face, even as they talked animatedly. An almost ghostly figure moved past, carrying a tray of drinks to one table. The figure was hauntingly familiar, and without flaw.

"Ah, sorry, one moment."

It huffed out a low word, and the room seemed to spin for a moment. But it solidified, with it seemingly unchanged.

"Forgive me, the help is a deliberately disconcerting."

I glanced back at the ghostly figure. It looked the same, bit this time I didn't think of it as perfect.

"What is this place?"

The dragon laughed, stroking the counter.

"A home away from home if you will. But good, you have curiosity. So, are you ready for your challenge?"

I focused on the dragon, now up against the bar.

"I'm ready for anything, what is this challenge?"

The dragon reached below the counter, pulling out three things. A pair of mugs, and a bright red bottle. One mug was significantly larger, which it took for itself.

"It's is simple. A drinking contest."

It pulled off the bottles cork, pouring us both a healthy amount.

"This is a vintage bottle of Firebrandy. Good stuff, and strong."

I sniffed the offered mug, wincing at the burning sensation in my nose. The dragon grinned wider, before taking a gulp from its. I frowned, taking a swig of my own. Instantly I felt my eyes water, as I forced myself to swallow. The alcohol burned its way down, my throat feeling as though it was burning.

"Good. That's just the beginning."

It shook the bottle, still disturbingly full.

"We are going to try and finish this together."

I let out a small whimper, glancing between the mug and the bottle. I expected a fight, or a battle of wits. Not something like this. It leaned towards me, smoky breath washing over my face.

"Unless you give up?"

It's words made me focus. I glared at it, forcing myself to take another burning swig.

"Never."

It laughed, topping up our mugs.

"Thats the spirit!"
