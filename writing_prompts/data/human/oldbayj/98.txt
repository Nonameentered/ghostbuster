Hey Katherine! Nice to see you on TT. I like where you went with the theme and I just love a good demon story! I particularly liked how you twisted his image, having him not conform with the typical demon image. I really enjoyed his character and voice. (Also love that comment about not needing a soul in politics lol.)   


A small thing I noticed is you to use interrupted dialogue quite a bit, which can be effective and natural, but when overused, it kind of loses that effect. In some places where we would naturally draw our words out, you can use ellipses, or even just a period. The reader can do the rest as they read.   


But I absolutely enjoyed this!
