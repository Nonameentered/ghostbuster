###To Be Chosen Is to be Cursed

***

Lavender, it’s always lavender. The aroma fills the room, moving in gentle wisps until it completely envelops me. It’s my anchor to this world. Sweet and soft; it’s one of those things that instantly takes me back. 


* * *
 

*A gentle breeze blows as I walk with Mama through the purple fields. The stalks tickle my legs and I laugh.* 

*She laughs too, tells me it’s because I'm special, part of the Chosen. “Only special girls feel the tickle of lavender.* 

*“I’m a special girl?” I ask, eyes bright with that sparkle kids have.*

*She smiles and squeezes my hand.*

I sit on the edge of the bed, running my fingers over the quilt’s yellow-stitched flowers. 

The room is in disrepair. Peeling paint, missing floorboards, dirt-caked windows. My eyes wander to a dusty photo on the dresser. Daddy’s dressed in a perfectly-pressed suit, Mama beside him, and me, with a wide-eyed smile. 

Back when I thought being special was a good thing.

*A black bird cries in the distance and I run ahead.*

*“Jade!” Mama calls after me, but I can’t stop.* 

*The bird trembles. Blood pools beneath his tiny body. His ribbon sways, threatening to yank him back and forth.* 

*Holding him in my hand, I feel his life fading with every movement. “Mama, can I cut it?”* 

*“The bird?”* 

*“No, his string.” I know I have to, the same way I know I have to breathe.* 

*She watches me clip a ribbon she can’t see. The little bird releases a final cry and falls still in my palm.*

Mama lies still on the bed tucked beneath the quilt. Course, grey hair spills out, her skin cracked and dry. Wrinkles cover her body, their lines like a map of her life. 

Anger bubbles in my chest. Why did I have to be the chosen one? Why me? 

I frown at myself in the mirror on the wall, trying to picture my seven year-old self. But only darkness stares back at me.

*“Sit still.” Mama scrunches her nose. “If you don’t let me brush it, it’ll all fall out.”*

*I gasp, thinking of myself with a shiny, bald head like Mr. Decker at the market.*

*Clumps of tangled hair decorate the floor. I try to fight against the pull of the comb, but it hurts.*

*“Why do we have to dye it? The colors are so pretty.” I say.*

*“Yes. But then people would know about you being special.”*

*I know…” More hair hits the floor. “I just don’t like hiding it.”*

Mama’s breaths grow shallow. It’s hard to look at her so old and weathered. My stomach twists into knots.  

I scoot closer and place her hand in mine. Despite her body, her spirit is as vibrant as it ever was. I wish, for just a moment, that she was more like me. Then she wouldn’t have to die. Or look like a dried-up piece of fruit.

She could be special, too. That thought hits me like a punch to the gut. 

Darkness is taking over more and more of my mind these days. What a cruel thing to wish for. 


*** 

*The sky has grown darker. Clouds hang low over the purple fields as we walk. I’m tired, and I think Mama is, too.* 

*She stops when we get to the oak tree. She opens her purse and hands me a snack. We sit together, munching beneath the shade.* 

*“You’re a very special girl, Jade. Don’t ever forget that.”*

*I smile. “How special?”*

*“So special that if anyone knew how much, they’d try to take you away...”*

*“Why?”*

*“Because they’re afraid of what they don’t understand.”*

*“Is that why we keep it a secret? And why we dye my hair?”*

*“Yes. You’re a Chosen, but you must always keep it a secret. Never let them take that from you.”*

*“I won’t Mama, promise!”* 

*As we get to the edge of the lavender field, angry voices fill the air. The guards are tearing through the village, searching houses, followed by men in weird suits. Maybe they’re astraunauts, or aliens. I’d ask, but Mama looks really scared.*

A breeze from the window brings me back to the room with Mama dying in the bed. I’d rather be anywhere else. If only I’d been a different kind of special, one who transcends time or changes fate, or sees prophecy. Anything, really. 

Just not this. 

Would it have been different if Mama let those guards find me? Could they have stopped this thing that grows within me, cut out the darkness? I’ll never know. 

“Goodbye, Mama,” I whisper. I clip the ribbon tethering her to this human world, her lifeline. Lavender fills the room as her spirit fades away. 

And for that one moment, everything is different. For one moment, I’m not special at all.
