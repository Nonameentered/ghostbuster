###You Can't Run

***

*Just smile, happiness will follow.* The therapist's words echo in my mind like a bad earworm as I descend into the subway station and make my way to the platform. I smile as a man passes by, one of only a few straggling passengers waiting for the last train. He doesn’t smile back—they never do. But he watches me closely as I move along the platform.

I lean against a pillar, surveying the area. Traveling is always a risk after sundown. The city has a way of coming alive in the darkness, when you least expect it.

My heart beats steadily against my chest, gaining speed as the minutes tick by. 

*The world’s not out to get you. You just have to believe it.* More of the therapist’s bullshit rolls through my mind. I should have gone into psychology. Then I, too, could charge a fortune to sit in my Fendi Casa chair and recite googled quotes to my clients and call it ‘medicine’. 

The ground vibrates as the train's lights come into view on the opposite track. A cold breeze rushes towards me, sending the smell of garbage and creosote into the air. Passengers flock to their destinations and I’m left standing in the empty subway station, alone. 

The overhead lights flicker. My heart pounds. Nausea warms my throat and goosebumps line my arms. 

I close my eyes and run a hand over my face. “There’s nothing out there,” I whisper.

A rustling echoes through the station; footsteps shuffle along the platform. 

“You’re in my head,” I say, a little louder this time. Removing my hand, I prepare to laugh at myself in the empty subway station. *My therapist is right, it’s all in my head. I’m madder than an outhouse rat.*

A dozen smiling faces stare back at me. Their smiles are wide, mouths extending ear-to-ear. Teeth sharp, and as white as the hooded robes that hang from their bodies. One waves. 

“No, no, no.” I stumble backwards, squeezing my eyes shut. “This isn’t real.”

The ground rumbles. I could stand here with my eyes closed until the other passengers flood the station. Step on and disappear into the night. 

But what if they are in on it, too? The passengers, the conductor, transportation security. You can’t trust anyone. Maybe they are all watching me, taking notes. Reporting back to their leader.  

The cold wind of the train approaches and I open my eyes. 

An empty platform greets me. No hoods. No sharp-toothed smiles. 

I exhale; the knot in my stomach releases. 

*Just smile.* The therapist’s words trickle in again as I board the train. *No one’s out to get you.* As the train doors close, I peek out the window, looking towards the empty station.

But it isn’t empty. 

The wide-smiling faces are back. Laughing. They charge toward the train as it pulls off. 

*We’re watching you,* one mouths. 

I shrink in my seat, trembling. There’s nowhere I can go. Not when the monster lives in my head.
