###The Root of the Problem

***
She would’ve ripped the heart right out of my chest if I let her. Raven was merciless that way. I imagine her standing there, head tilted, smiling, as she watches the blood drip between her fingers. Shreds of my sad, lifeless organ hanging from her palm as the beating slows to a stop. 

Maybe I should have let her. 

We met at a hole-in-the-wall bar on the East Side. A stunning beauty she was, with deep green eyes, a soft pointed nose, and long, white curls that cascaded down her back. She was the kinda woman that could get a man to do anything, no questions asked. You’d do anything just to be near her, to be enveloped by those sweet floral wisps.

When you were with Raven, you were *with* her, entirely. Your everything belonged to her: your mind, your body, your soul. She’d claim it all. And you’d gladly give it to her. 

Because there’s no way of knowing the truth, until it’s too late.

I pull my gaze back inside the room as Detective Tracey clears her throat. She’s been visiting once a week since I arrived. Her visits provide a welcome break to the monotonous routine of the hospital. But she can be relentless with how far she’ll push. One day, it’ll be her downfall.

“Where did you go just now?” she asks.

“Back to the beginning, I suppose.”

She nods. “Tell me about that.”

“I don’t like going there.”

“Why’s that?”

I exhale slowly, the memories’ weight pressing against my chest. “It feels like I never had a choice with Raven, like I was never in control. From the moment I saw her, I was at her mercy.”

Tracey pushes pen to paper, periodically nodding and glancing up to meet my gaze. 

“Sometimes I do wish I could go back to the day we met, so that I could turn around and run like hell.” I pull at a loose thread on my sleeve, watching the seams slowly unravel. “You know,” I sigh, “other times, I’m not sure I would do anything different. I loved her, and that part felt good.” 

“What about her death?” 

I stand and walk to the window, pausing to watch the raindrops stream down the glass between the metal bars. 

“Would you do that differently, Felix?” she asks.

“I can’t.”

“But let’s say you could. Would you?”

“I… don’t know.”

“Do you regret having taken her life?”

“I don’t know.” 

“I think you do. But maybe you feel like your truths are worse than your lies.”

“What does that even mean?”

She closes her notebook. “Well, I think you do know how you feel about it. But I also think maybe you’re afraid of the answer.” 

I turn around to face her, leaning against the window pane. She looks so small and helpless sitting in that chair, and not at all like someone to be feared. Not at all like Raven.  

“Tell me about the day of the murder.”

“She was going to kill me.”

“You’ve said that before, but there’s no evidence to support that.”

“So why do you keep asking?”

“Because I want the truth, Felix.”

“That is the truth.”

“I’ve a hard time believing that tiny woman could’ve gotten the upper hand.”

“That’s where you’re wrong. Raven wasn’t… *really* a woman.”

“What does that mean?”

“She wasn’t…” 

My mind slips back to that day—an otherwise ordinary Saturday. 

Until I asked about our future.

The aroma of damp earth filled our apartment as her bones snapped like twigs. Her caramel flesh hardened into thick bark branches, her white hair became a tangled bush of leaves and vines. Horns grew from the sides of her face.

“I thought we’d have more time, Felix. Why’d you have to ask that?” 

“What the fuck!” Those were the only words I could muster, with fear overflowing from every orifice I had. 

“I’m gonna miss you the most, I think. But you’ll forever be a part of me. Your bones will nourish me, your blood will fuel me, your skin will keep me warm.”

Everything after that is a blur.

“That’s quite the tale,” Tracey says.

My eyes widen, not realizing I’d been recounting the details aloud. 

“She would’ve ripped the heart right out of my chest if I let her.” 

“Felix, that’s not what happened.”

“You weren’t there!”

“No, but I know it didn’t happen. And I know they found a very dead *human* woman in your apartment that day.” 

“I can’t explain that.” I turn away.

The smell of damp earth and sound of twigs snapping forces me to turn back. 

Raven glares back at me, licking Tracey’s blood from her lips. She smiles, placing a clawed hand on my face. “That’s okay honey, we all go a little mad sometimes.”
