This is an interesting setting and I like the way you incorporated the theme into the piece. My biggest crit would be that you switch from past to present within the piece, and it is a bit confusing. I'd suggest choosing one of those and sticking to it. I also didn't find myself incredibly connected to the main character, or invested in things going well for him. There's a lot of procedural discussion, which is great for the setting, but I would have loved to get a more intimate picture of him. I want a reason to root for him.
