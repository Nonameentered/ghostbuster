I see their faces in my dreams; beaten, bloody, terrified. I mourn for them, for their families. But I don’t know who they are. And I don’t know why I killed them. 

The detective—who I’ve been calling ‘Shiny Shoes’—scoffs and points at the crime scene photos in front of me. “You can give this woman’s family closure. Save them and yourself from going through a long trial. We can arrange a deal.”

“How many times can I tell you the same thing? I don’t remember this woman.” I push the photos away. “I don’t remember any of them.”

“Nobody is buying that bullshit.” 

I sigh, glancing around the hospital room. Shiny Shoes isn’t entirely wrong; it sounds like bullshit. I wouldn’t believe me, either. But it’s the truth. My memories are locked behind a wall of grey haze. The doctor already told him that amnesia was common—and extremely likely—given my head injury. He didn’t buy it. 

At half past eight, the nurse arrives with my next dose of Morphine. My body screams in pain, but I’m afraid to take the medication. Afraid of what I’ll dream. 

I don’t want to see their mangled faces. Hear their desperate pleas. I don’t want to feel their icy fingers on my throat as I sleep. 

It’s hard to believe I’m that guy. The guy Shiny Shoes tells me about. A monster who killed for sport, then dumped the bodies in the river like garbage. 

Sure, the police get it wrong all the time. But I don’t think they’re wrong about me. Not this time. I may not remember any of it, but I feel a darkness swirling around inside of me, weighing me down. Whispering in my ear.

Warmth radiates through my veins as the Morphine drips in, and the room goes dark. 

*You’re a murderer,* one voice whispers. *A cold-blooded killer.*

*Please don’t kill me,* a second voice pleads. 

*You’re scum,* spits a third.

Their faces come into focus. They surround me, inching closer and closer. 

*We’re gonna burn you alive and send your ashes to Hell.* They all laugh in unison. 

I can’t tell who is saying what; there are more faces than I can count. They close in on me, growling and hungry, like a pack of wolves. They scream and cry and beg for mercy. 

“Stop it!” I yell. My head is scrambled, my heart torn. But I still can’t remember. “I’m so sorry for what I did, you gotta know that.”

“You aren’t.” A red-haired woman emerges from the darkness, her face dripping with blood. “But you will be.” 

She snaps her fingers and I awake in my hospital room. I remember everything. Each face. Each word they uttered. And every terrible thing I ever did. 

They were right. I am a monster. A cold-blooded killer.

I buzz the nurse in and ask if she can call Mr. Shiny Shoes for me. “Tell him I remember. And I’m ready to confess.” 

Hell can’t come soon enough.
