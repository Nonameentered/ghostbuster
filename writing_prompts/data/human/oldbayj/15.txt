#I am Not Me When I Dream

***

The smell of damp earth. The all-consuming darkness. The suffocating heat. 

Then, the panic.

I breathe deeply, over and over, gasping for air so desperately that my lungs burn. Thrashing between these unmovable walls. This prison that grows smaller with every breath.

*Why can’t I move?* 

Sweat coats my trembling body. It’s as if I’m slowly falling into the bowels of Hell itself. My thoughts are jumbled. Partial images of faces and fragments of voices bleed together as I try to unscramble them. But they fracture right down the middle, like the pieces of an old mirror.

I punch and kick the ceiling, but my muscles tire. It doesn’t budge. 

The smell of earth intensifies. It envelops me, the way nature does. 

Then it hits me. I try to scream but there isn’t enough air. I claw at the box; my fingernails snap. The pain reverberates through me and blood drips down my hands. I’m swallowed by the darkness. 

And all I can hear is her voice, pleading. Begging for Mama to help. 

In this place, I realize I am not me. I am her. 

I awake in my own bed, safe and free. Sweat still coats my skin; the nightgown I’m wearing clings to my skin like plastic wrap. I yank it from my body and leave it crumpled on the carpet. 

For a few moments, I sit, motionless. I know I need to call for help, but my mind fights to remain in this limbo. 

I imagine, for a moment, that she could be sleeping soundly in the next room, dreaming of perfect pirouettes. Her silky hair fanned across the pillow, toes peeking out from bunched blankets, as they once did. Before she disappeared.

I pick up the telephone with trembling hands and dial. 

A groggy voice whispers, “Sheriff Billins.” 

“Sheriff, it’s Anne.”

“Goddamnit, Anne. It’s three in the morning.”

“Yes, but listen.” 

He grunts. 

“I know where she is! You’ve gotta help, please. Someone’s buried her.. alive!” 

“Anne, just stop.”

“W-why won’t you help her, Sheriff? She’ll die!” 

He pauses, then exhales. “We did everything we could. *Everything.*”

“You’re not doing anything! I’m telling you, she’s out there. Alone. Buried, fighting to get out. She’s screaming for me. Please…”

“We go through this at least twice a year.” A long silence follows. “Your daughter is dead. We found Beverly’s body in a shallow grave off Route 66. Four *years* ago… I’m sorry.”

“No, God noooo.” I sink to the floor, dropping the phone. Screaming into the night, I feel the pain rip through my chest like a ravenous beast. And I remember it all. 

*How many times can I relive the worst day of my life?* 

I crawl to her bedroom and grab the blanket from the bed. I squeeze it tight, letting the faint scent of lilac shampoo calm me. 

In my mind, we dance together around the room. The only place she was truly safe. And the only place her energy will forever live.
