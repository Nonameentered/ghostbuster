The Ticonderoga was humanity's most advanced ship. Two centuries of scavenging the leftover pieces of long-dead alien civilizations had made most of Earth's ships into a hodgepodge of bolted on second hand parts, but the Ticon had been designed from scratch to integrate the best technology from a thousand worlds.

Nestled inside It's single-molecule inner hull, Captain Hernandez ordered it's crew to jump stations. The slow hum of clipped orders that filled the ship rose in pitch as the officers and the synths double checked systems. They were ready to navigate the torturous path into the Sagitarius Prime system.

Sagittarius Prime was the last unexplored system in humanity's home galaxy. The humans knew very little about it, other than to get to it you had to swing past the core black hole at relativistic speed, and that it was often mentioned in the last deciphered message of the dead civilizations sprinkled about the galaxy.

The Explorers Faction had commissioned the Ticonderoga to reach it. Officially, the ship wouldn't be ready for another two standard years, and was subject to Terran review and oversight. Unofficially, the only thing that prevented the ship from meeting final launch specifications was that they forgot to stock the coffee on the third-floor break room.

Executive Officer Tarquinson acknowledged the last ready-go signal from the crew. "Captain, we are prepped on your order."

The Captain looked at her board. Everything was green except for the small light indicating the lack of coffee in the third-floor break room. She disabled that light. "Ticon, spin-up jump drive. Jump when ready."

Neither her nor the crew was needed past that order. The synths would bring them safely to their destination, wrapping round the galaxy's largest black hole to do it, while the organics sat and drank coffee. Or in the case of the unfortunate crew members stationed on the third-floor, tea.

The Captain turned to her first officer. "We're on our way, Tarq. What do you think we'll find?"

"You know, Jules, we've been prepping for this mission for three years and that's the first time you've asked me that question. I've always assumed you thought we'd find the last great tech stash, or maybe the fabled Final Enclave of the lost civilizations."

The Captain sipped her coffee. "That's the hope, at least, but you know what's in Cargo Hold B. If we find the First People. If they truly are the cause of all the lost civsâ€” I just want to know that you're ready to do it if you have to take command."

Tarquinson straightened his posture in his command chair. "Yes, Sir. Though it won't come to that. You really think all those wackos are right with their talk of Eldritch Gods?"

"No, or I wouldn't have accepted this mission. But you have to admit. All those lost civs, all those dead planets, all those end of days messages. There were an awful lot of tentacles."

The ship went suddenly silent as the jump drives triggered. The next moments were a skew of accelerated time as the ship sheared across the event horizon of Sagittarius A\*. When the ship popped back into realtime, Captain Hernandez took one look at the screen and dropped her coffee.

\----------------------------------------

GRXUNKLPON felt something brush against their tentacles. A disturbance. An interloper. A pest. Their solitude that had stretched on pleasantly for epochs was broken. They reached out to destroy it.

The ship was a small thing, hard to grip in even their smallest tentacle, but GRXUNKLPON had long practice with pests. As they began to wrap around it, a device launched from the rear of the ship. A Nova bloomed. A star or a planet would have been turned into a dust cloud, but GRXUNKLPON sucked down the nova through a feeding tentacle and felt a rush of energy.

GRXUNKLPON rapped the ship in a shell of writhing limbs and ripped open the top of the interloper. They sensed scurrying lifeforms, both organic and lithogenic. They found one of the organics and brought a sense organ to bear on it. GRXUNKLPON froze.

It didn't look anything like a crab. Organic interlopers usually looked like crabs. GRXUNKLPON poked it with a cilla. It was soft and squishy. It emitted a pleasant scream. It's eyes were big and round.

For the first time in aeons, since it had devoured the second to last of its kind, GRXUNKLPON spoke. "Oh my god, they're so cute!"
