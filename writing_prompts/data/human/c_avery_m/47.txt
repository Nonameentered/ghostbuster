Robyn pulled back on her bowstring and blew the errant tuft of hair out of her face. The hair wafted about in the breeze for a second before falling perfectly behind her ear. The flags on the range were whipping themselves in every direction as she lined up her shot. She loosed her arrow and turned to hear the cheer of the crowd.

Instead of the expected cheer the crowd responded with a laugh and some heckling. Robyn turned back around to look for her arrow, and found it sticking straight in the bullseye, as she had intended. The bullseye of her opponent's target to the right of hers.

"Fleece darn it," she muttered and quickly nocked another arrow, letting it fly in a single motion. This one landed another bullseye, in the target to the left of hers. Half the crowd cheered this time, while the rest kept laughing.

She took her time with the third, focusing her intent on her own target. The soft plunk as it hit true brought a true cheer from the crowd. Robyn bowed and went to collect her trophy.

\------------------------------------

"What do you mean I didn't win? Nobody else got a bullseye. WIth this wind, the closest anybody else got was the outer ring!"

The judge shrugged, making his velvet robes dance in the wind. "Bob's target had eleven points, which as a learn-ed scholar I can tell you is one more than the ten points that your target had."

"Bob had one point in the outer ring. His other two arrows flew off into the bog."

"When I examined the targets, he had one arrow in the outer ring and one in the bullseye." He did not pause to let her object. "I, of course, am well aware that the second arrow bears your mark. Forsooth, the rules clearly state that any marked arrow in a competitor's target shall count for points. Furthermore, the rules are quite clear and written in Latin so they must be correct. As a woman you will, of course, have to take my word for it."

Robyn skulked off while Bob went to collect his prize. The Half-King stood upon the parapet of the castle looking down at the crowd and praised Bob's Good and Manly Archery Skills. He tossed down a small bag of silver while the princess let one of her silk favors drop into the wind.

Bob doffed his cap and ran after the favor as it floated far from the castle walls. Robyn scowled at the whole thing from the edge of the woods. She was too far away for the guards to be worried or even notice her any longer, but she nocked an arrow, aimed at the Half-King and let fly.

She watched it as it flew through the space between her and the castle. "Cow's farts. That arrow has my mark on it still."

If not for the wind, the arrow would have fallen far short, but it lofted farther and farther while the look of horror grew on Robyn's face. As it slammed into the mortared wall below the Half-King and bounced off into the moat, she sighed in relief.

"They won't be able to find the mark," she told herself as she prepared to walk into the woods. When the castle wall began to crack and fall, taking the Half-King with it, she switched to a run.
