"Are you cheating on me?" Hera asked the question while finishing up the dishes. She stood at the sink, her larger than life head nearly hitting the ceiling, using part of her purple toga as a dishtowel.

Julia was still toweling off her hair from her morning shower. Her long brown hair took forever to dry, but she didn't use a hairdryer as it would frizz up. She twisted it all up in the towel and set it as a turban on the top of her head. She had to balance it carefully as she tilted her head to look up at Hera. "Why are you doing the dishes? We have a dishwasher."

"Where were you last night? I was waiting for you to come home and you were late."

Julia sighed. "I was working. You know that. Alone. No men, just me and the computer."

Hera screwed her lips up and gave Julia a distrustful look. "And no women? No swans? Bulls? No golden rain?"

Julia reached up to squeeze Hera's hand. "No, my soulmate. I'm not like your ex. You really should talk to Dr. Cohen about these things. The trust issues."

Hera's eyes seemed to glow, matching the crown on her head. When she spoke her voice wasn't louder, just more forceful. "I'm not crazy. I don't need to talk to your Stoic Oracle."

Julia continued squeezing her hands and Hera settled down. "Leave the dishes. Have a coffee with me before work. I've only got a couple minutes before things get busy."

The attendant brought in a carafe and poured two cups. Julia cuddled on Hera's lap as they sipped their coffee and gazed out the window at the sunrise coming up over the rolling hills. Hera's eyes wandered to the lamp sitting under security glass above the mantle. "Are you ever going to use that third wish?"

Julia chuckled. "I don't need it. I have everything I want right here. You are the best soulmate I could have asked for. The second wish was more than I could have hoped for."

"But your first wishâ€”" Hera stopped when Julia reached up and placed a finger on her lips.

"Don't talk about work. I only get so much time with you each day and I want to savor it."

They chatted lovingly as the sky brightened slowly from red and orange to clear blue. As Julia set her empty cup of coffee down, a bell rang. She got up and untwisted the towel from her hair. Reaching up on her tiptoes, she placed a kiss on Hera's neck. "Duty calls. I'll see you after work."

The door opened as two men entered, in black uniforms with lightning bolt insignia on the chests. They knelt in unison. The taller of the two spoke. "My Lord, there is much news today of the war. Your enemies flee before your power."

Julia handed the towel to a faceless attendant. "Very good. Arise. First, tell me about progress on the Lightning Projector, then I'll want to see the latest troop deployments, then we'll go over reports on..."

As Julia walked off surrounded by troops, Hera smiled. She really was the perfect match.
