"Alright, people... ghosts— ghosts and whatever Phil is. The deadline, pun intended, is 2 am. Get your copy in. Gertrude, I need a thousand words on the city council meeting. Frankie, write up the notes from that murder victim interview and send them to Frannie to add to her crime piece. JJ, pull some national news from the wire services and punch it up with some local color. Move it people— uh... ghosts and whatever."

Julia's parents had tried to convince her to study a different subject in school, or at least to go into video. Print journalism was dead, they said. Seeing the newsroom filled with ghosts, Julia was more than willing to admit they were right, but it wasn't going to stop her from getting out a paper.

She'd been hired by the town merely to wind the paper down after the death of Mazel, the long time editor and last employee. The town loved their paper and wanted at least a few last editions before the whole shop closed. When she'd found the newspaper haunted, she'd nearly run away, but most of the ghosts, other than whatever Phil was, were not very scary. And they still loved journalism. So she'd decided that the paper's funeral would have to wait.

"Julia, I can't get this article to upload." The yellow spectre floating next to her desk was Jack, the sportswriter.

"Give it to Layout, they'll make sure it gets on the website." Her parents were right, print was dead. They still did a small run for the locals, but the new lifeblood of the paper was going to be the website, something Mazel had never set up.

Julia looked over the copy that floated over to her desk. "Luke, we can't print this. Nixon isn't President anymore."

A shrill wail pierced the clack of typewriters from around the room. Julia sighed. "Yes, I know the backroom ghosts have a tenuous link to the present. Tell them— Tell them to write some long form retrospectives. We'll print them as historical documentary pieces. Just make sure you pass them through Henry to remove all the racism. And the sexism. And everything else." The backroom ghosts had a lot of -isms.

As the night wore on, more pages floated their way to her desk, and after her signoff went to Layout. The newsroom clock struck two.

"That's it people— and Phil, whatever. We've got a paper! Send it to the printer and the website."

Julia shrugged on her coat and paused for a second next to the door. "And remember to put my name as the byline for everything. We wouldn't want to raise suspicions."

They didn't need the credit, they didn't mind being ghostwriters.
