\[Part 2/2\]

Julia awoke to pressure on every side of her. She could only see a dim red glow, but she felt constrained on every side. She squirmed in struggle, but the only thing she could move was her jaw.

She licked the membrane that was pressed against her mouth. It was spongy and tasted of iron. She craved it. Pushing her jaws forward, she took a bite. Her sharp teeth sliced through the membrane like jello. The hole was big enough to fit her head through. It was tight against her neck, but she forced that through and the rest of her slid out and fell on the floor.

She looked around. It was dim. A cave. But her eyes picked out details in the dark. Looking down, she saw a writhing, looping mass of slick skin. Startled, she slithered away as quickly as she could. She craned her neck to look back; the creature was following her.

Julia froze and the creature froze as well. She tried to look at her hands but could not feel her arms. She wiggled her backside and the long tube of skin pulsed.

"Well, fuck." The words came out as a crackly hiss.

Looking back the way she'd come, she saw an oozing, broken pod. She saw others around the edge of the cave, dried and leathery. Some seemed to be crumbling to dust. None of them seemed to be intact. "Eggs," she said to herself.

She tried to look at her own body. She was a long eel with smooth hard skin. She felt at her teeth with her tongue. There were multiple rows in a complete circle around her mouth. The outermost was sharp, followed by many tiers of hard molars. Her lips were as rough as sandpaper.

She took a deep breath. The smell of the dust made her stomach rumble. The egg sac had tasted good but now it disgusted her. The stone dust floating through the air of the cave was her craving now.

She licked the floor. It tasted like... granite. She moved on to the chamber's entryway. Here the walls had a hint of quartz and feldspar. Delicious. She'd spent years with the dust of these rocks filling her mouth on field duty, but she'd never thought they tasted good before.

She crunched at the rock in blissful rumination until her hunger subsided. Then she wandered upward through the cave wondering what to do about the situation, licking each new rock she came to.

"Muscovite, Biotite, Amphibole, Riebeckite," she said to herself. Suddenly she stopped. "Bauxite! The colony could really use a source of aluminum. The committee is going to be excited about this... And if I wasn't a snake now I could tell them."

She coiled herself, despondent. This wasn't exactly what she had in mind when she signed up for the colony ship. It was supposed to be a new world and adventure. Not death and... something... whatever this was. "Am I going to spend the rest of her life as a snake?"

She gathered her courage. "Fuck it, misadventure is still adventure. I'm going to go tell them anyways. No reason why a snake can't serve as colony geologist."
