Julia bounced boobily down the stairs.

"No," said Julia, to nobody in particular. She pirouetted her dancer's body and lunged back up the stairs. Sorting through the closet full of lace and lingerie, she whispered huskily to herself while discarding each item as unsuitable for her lithe figure and mercurial mood. Finally, she pulled out the last item from the bottom of an unused pile, a — uh— oversized, stained sweatshirt from a charity walk she did several years ago. "That's better," she said, as she slipped the sweatshirt over her delicate frame. "That should cut down on these bosom descriptions."

Julia glumly walked down the stairs, looking like a sack of potatoes. She smiled.

The stains on her sweatshirt reminded her of a night of passion. Each one was reminiscent of the famous blue — "No," Julia said, interrupting the train of thought. "These are ketchup and mustard stains. And they aren't even from hotdogs or corndogs or anything phallic shaped. They were from a series of completely normal hamburgers. And don't even think about making it some weird food fetish thing."

Julia walked like a normal human being into the kitchen. Her golden hair shone as the morning light struck it through the bay window. Her bright blue eyes glanced through the selection of cereal boxes sitting on top of her refrigerator. Her thoughts turned wistfully to the dinner she had planned for tonight, her second date with the brooding Antonius. She scowled.

"I'm not going on a second date with that asshole." As she spoke, she glared daggers at one particular side of the room, a wall that held no furniture nor doors.

"But it's IMPORTANT to your CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT," said the wall. "Antonius will help reveal your INNER STRUGGLE and lead to your EMPOWERMENT."

"Antonius will reveal that he is an asshole who mistreats women. I'm not going to go along with his bullshit for three more dates just so that I can then magically realize he's bad for me."

The wall slumped and gave a sigh. "Fine."

Julia took out her phone started swiping through dating apps, looking for the perfect match. Her perfectly manicured nails slid across the screen as she debated the merits of strong chins and furrowed brows. Suddenly, she threw the phone in the trash. "Not doing that."

"But you need to do something."

"I'm going to spend the next eight hours at my computer, working. Then I'm going to spend the evening watching tv and eating that pint of ice cream that's in the freezer. No men will be involved."

The wall stood blankly, wall-like. Slowly, it glowed with inspiration. The doorbell rang. Julia glanced suspiciously at the wall before opening the door.

A raven haired beauty stood on the doorstep. Her bosom heaved as her lush red lips breathlessly introduced herself. "Hello, I'm Tarquina, your new neighbor."

Julia slammed the door in her face. Turning, she stomped to the garage, returning with a hammer and nails. The world pulsed red with each hammer blow as she drove a nail into a stud on the wall. Wordlessly, she took a painting from the far wall and moved it to the new nail. Everything went black.
