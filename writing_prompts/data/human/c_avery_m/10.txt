Tarquin never thought to see a look of fear on her face.

It had been his duty to escorte Princess Julia to the palace for the wedding. The Knights of the Rose were charged with protecting the High Ladies of the realm with vigilance, strength, honor, and very little discretion. As Knight Commander he had led a squad of twenty to be her escort.

Of the twenty, sixteen had made it through the desert to her mother's camp. The return trip had been worse, with snakes, storms, and bandits attempting to take their prize. In the end, he and one other knight had survived, with the Princess Julia carrying them over her shoulders out of the wasteland.

Tarquin had seen her gut seven men with the knife she was now wielding, but the one she now faced plucked it out of her hand like it was nothing. Julia's face quivered while the Royal Dressmaker continued listing the colors of silk available.

"Cream with lace for the wedding itself, with a heavy veil. Sky Blue for the reception, knotted lace for the night." The dressmaker handed the knife off to an assistant. "And bring a dressing gown so that we can burn this leather thing she is wearing."

Julia scowled. "I made this sand harness from the first desert dragon I killed. It is forged of my own hands and skill."

"Well, that explains the stitching. We'll need to replace those boots, too." As the dressmaker knelt to measure her legs, Julia turned to Tarquin and mouthed 'help me'.

He sighed and stepped forward. His oaths bound him to protect.

"Perhaps, uh— Madam Dressmaker— perhaps the princess' dresses could be made in her— uh— native style? It would not do to, well, insult the culture of the King's new allies." Tarquin stood with his head straight, looking over the top of the servants.

The dressmaker cleared her throat until he glanced down to meet her eyes. "That would be scandalous. It will not do."

He straightened his back with difficulty. A single drop of sweat ran down his temple. "Perhaps, uh, yes. Or— or, the style could be a new fashion. The ladies of the kingdom will want to... emulate their new queen."

The dressmaker held her shears like a sword. The rest of the servants had frozen. Tarquin did not breathe.

"Three sets. One in red leather. One black. One fur lined. Each will be gilded. But she will have a set of proper dresses as well. Fetch the leatherworkers!" The servants scurried into action.

Tarquin turned to see a look of relief on Julia's face. He felt emboldened as he turned back to the dressmaker. "And the dresses should be cut for full range of motion, with multiple knife sheaths. No lace."

The dressmaker did not look up from her work. "Sir Tarquin, I think it may be time to redesign your uniform. You would look fine in lace."

"No, madam, I will leave you to do your duty." He retreated to a corner. It was important to pick your battles.
