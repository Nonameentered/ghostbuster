Thank you for the critique. They are always welcome.

I was deliberately trying to practice descriptive imagery in this one, so that's good to hear. You're right about how the battle-weary sprites and the ravenous gnomes didn't get much screen time. (I critique all my pieces over at r/c_avery_m the next day so I'll be thinking more about how I could have adjusted this.)
