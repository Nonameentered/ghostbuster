I have gotten used to the dead bodies. They always stay in one place. The ones on either side of dead move around far too much. Just today one of the revived gnawed through it's leg and tried to hobble off, into the city. The gatekeepers are ever vigilant, and brought it back.

The not yet dead are generally smarter in their escape attempts, but are rarely willing to eat their own limbs off, so the attempts are decidedly less frequent. Instead they plead with me when I bring them their meals or flay their skin. Their offers do not tempt me, I shall find them much more appealing once they are dead.

Back, before I was the necromancer's apprentice, out in the city, the living mistreated me. The bastard child of the gravedigger was, when not beneath their notice, only an object of scorn. When I go out now, in the robe and skullcap of my office, they only pretend not to notice. They pretend to be calm when they see me, but my ghost whispers their fears in my ear.

Today is a day I have been waiting for. My bone polishing is impeccable, my embalming odorless, my spirit cocoons without leaks. After long scrutiny and years of practice, Master Hathon says that I have completed training in the care of the dead. I will finally join her in a transition ceremony, marking my rise to Senior Apprentice.

The transition chamber is brightly lit, with gaslamps evenly spaced around the circular room. Two of the younger apprentices have brought up the vessel, a fat middle aged man whom I recognized from the holding cells. He was securely strapped to the table, but I checked the straps while the younger apprentices watched, then waited while Master Hathon dismissed them.

She turned to me. "Apprentice Julia, what transition do you think would be most appropriate for this vessel?"

An easy question, since we'd been ordered to stuff him full of food and antiemetics for the past six weeks. "The vessel's adipose tissue makes it an ideal candidate for a ghoul. Or a bagarast if there was need for one, though if there was, I think we have a more appropriate candidate in holding cell sixteen."

"Just so. A ghoul it is, then. The mines can always use them. I will observe your setup."

I hurried about the room, pulling instruments from the drawers lining the walls. I had memorized the layout needed for this procedure, had cleaned and put away the instruments many times, but this was my first chance to do the setup myself.

It took me two tries to insert the tubes. When I worked the pumps the blood flowed out quickly. The vessel shuddered, but not for long. When the vessel was still, Master Hathon began her part of the ceremony, dipping fingers into the jar of blood to write the runes upon the vessel's skin. A ghoul ceremony does not take long, and Master Hathon ran through it with practiced grace. She finished by writing her name in runes on the chest of the ghoul, along with a serial number, then stood back to sing the final enchantment.

I positioned myself at the head of the vessel and waited. Its eyes reopened, the pupils quickly dilating until its sockets were completely black. I removed the gag to check for success and was greeted with the proper moan.

"Nooooâ€” it was so peaceful. Let me back. Let me back." The ghoul struggled against the straps. I'd never seen a ghoul upset before.

Master Hathon looked at me. "Complete the binding apprentice. You know the words."

I spoke the words of power. "Calm, ghoul, and obey. Be true and obedient in your service and you shall go back when released. We are your only path back to that place."

When the ghoul's eyes glazed over, I smiled. Another faithful servant had been born.
