The Orc invasion was short-lived. The government spokesperson was reticent to even call it an invasion, but the cable news stations insisted. It was mostly one station in particular, but the rest of them seemed to go along with it. In the end it was decided that four Orcs with magic staves popping into the middle of Central Park was sufficient to qualify as an invasion, even if they were swiftly captured once their magic staves stopped working.

Special Agent Julia Hernandez drank her coffee while reviewing the tapes from the holding cell. It was the Bureau's most secure room. The Orcs had been transferred there from their original location in the drunk tank of the Central Park Precinct. They'd apparently gotten along pretty well with the drunks.

They spoke to each other now in a harsh guttural language that nobody could identify, but the cops that transferred them insisted that they'd heard them speak in English a couple times. Julia went down to try to talk with them.

As she was approaching the door, the lock beeped and the door swung open. Both she and the guards next to the door quickly drew their weapons and covered the doorway. One of the Orc's looked out sheepishly, holding a thin metal shim in his hand.

He spoke in a harsh but intelligible accent. "Sorry. Not know door had remain closed." He turned and walked back into the room.

Julia handed her weapon to one of the guards and went in, closing the door after herself. "So, you can speak English. How did you open the door?"

"Of course Grog speak English. Last four worlds all English." One of the other Orcs mumbled something to Grog. "One speak Dutch. Still New Amsterdam. That pretty close. Door simple solenoid mechanism. Easy open."

"Last four worlds? How did you get here?"

"Oh, you not know multiverse theory. Me forget humans stupid. Me Grog. That Remy, Wade, and The Professor. We travel multiverse looking for home. Have to wander due to wizard curse. Find many world. All different. None home."

Julia was silent. She felt that this might be above her pay grade.

"You let Orc go now. We not do crime. This seem good timeline. Not like last timeline. Last timeline had global pandemic. We teach how make antiviral but whole timeline going downhill. Started when they kill Gorilla name Harambe."
