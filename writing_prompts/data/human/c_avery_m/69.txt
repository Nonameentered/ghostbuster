Golbur would have been tired of being mistreated, if his imprinted training allowed that feeling. As it was, only a general instability in his mental processes churned through his brain, distracting him slightly from his assigned task.

His body, male because the lack of reproductive facilities ensured that his makers retained their monopoly, was squat, heavily muscled, and pale grey. With four limbs, because that was widely seen as the minimum number necessary for general purpose labor, and no neck to speak of, having the required sensor organs placed in a small cluster squarely on top of his ovoid torso.

His metallic partner, BY-7, beeped to indicate that another passenger was approaching. BY-7 just floated there, unhelpfully, while Golbur rushed forward to take their luggage. It had been a busy day. The cruise ship was about to depart for another destination and all the passengers were returning from their excursions down below.

The tone of BY-7's beeps had indicated that this passenger was one of the Grandees, on a Tier One ticket. Golbur was expected to show haste. You couldn't tell it by looking at them as they were still in the holo-disguise of a local. The locals were ugly, tall, mostly covered in coarse fur and fiber clothing leaving just patches of colored skin showing. Their forelimbs both had five digits, each of which ended in stubby useless claws. Golbur had learned that the bumpy bits on the front of this passenger indicated that their disguise was of a female.

"Put this one in stasis," she said, handing him a small package. "Deal with the rest as usual."

"Yes, Lord," Golbur said in reply. It was the only thing his training allowed him to ever say to a Grandee. The passenger had turned and left without waiting for the response.

Golbur looked at his package while BY-7 told the rest of the baggage to hover into their assigned berth. His package had no hover controls. It seemed like primitive native construction and was covered in some arcane local lettering. It has handles and an archaic metallic closure.

"Can you read this BY-7?"

The drone quickly scanned it. "It is in the dominant local language. It says 'Gucci'. No further information on origin. Scans indicate the presence of a lifeform."

Golbur froze for an instant to process this. His imprinted training was to follow the Grandee's orders and place this package in stasis, which conflicted with additional imprinting on proper baggage handling of lifeforms. He examined the metallic closure for a minute to determine how to open the package and discovered that it zipped open much like a food packet.

Inside, swaddled in blankets, was a small immature, four-limbed native. It's large blue eyes blinked up at him. A pink bow was attached to the top of it's head and it was garbed in an equally pink outfit. Opening the package had awoken it. Golbur quickly reclosed the package as it began to make terrible noises.

"BY-7, it's a local child. We can't put this in stasis."

"Scans indicate a biochemistry compatible with a Class Two stasis pod. There are several available."

The noises continued from the package, which was now rocking while the creature struggled inside. Golbur looked at BY-7. "This is a pre-contact planet. Status unlikely to change in the next 144 cycles. Regulations imprinted by my manufacturer indicate that the punishment for helping smuggle a sapient off of this planet is mindwipe."

BY-7 hovered nearby. "My programming indicates that the punishment for not doing what a Grandee says is to be thrown out the nearest airlock, unless it's a Jubilee Day."

Golbur brightened up. "Oh. It is a Jubilee Day. They always have Jubilees when leaving a planet."

"On Jubilee Days the punishment is to be the main course at the Jubilee."

Golbur wasn't afraid of death. His manufacturer considered Fear of Death and other lifespan extending programming as an optional add-on costing an extra twenty credits which his purchaser had not bothered to spend. What he was afraid of was contravening his imprinted regulations of baggage handling. Somehow he would return this infant to the surface.

He planned out the route to the transport bay. It was treacherous only if he was seen by a passenger. None of the crew on this level would stop him. He reached to pick up the package, but his training stopped him. The bag itself was allowed cargo, and his training said it should be placed in stasis as ordered. Only the contents need be returned.

Unzipping the top once again, he prepared to lift the creature out. As he moved his hand toward it, it sprang to it's paws and began to growl. Undeterred, he attempted to grab it's fur. The creature bit at his hand but it's small sharp teeth failed to penetrate his thick skin. He grabbed the collar around its neck, but it twisted and slipped out of the collar, jumped from the bag, and ran down the corridor towards the passenger section.

He was left holding the collar, which was red with gold lettering. BY-7 scanned it and said it read 'Fluffy'.
