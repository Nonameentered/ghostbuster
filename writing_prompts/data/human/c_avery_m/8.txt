"Well, this has been fun, but I really have to be getting home." Julia was talking to the facility's head researcher. The man continued writing on his clipboard without looking up. He made a gesture and one of the technicians fired another laser at Julia. The laser tickled slightly..

"It's confirmed then. Immortal and invulnerable. With the subject's unique physiology, the treatment was a success." A couple of the technicians in the back high-fived each other.

Julia leaned forward in the chair and tapped him on the shoulder. "I said I've got to be getting home. I'm out of vacation time."

Director Tarquin finally looked her in the eyes. "I'm afraid I can't allow that, Miss Julia. You see, you are a unique resource. A national resource. You'll have to stay here." He pushed a button and the chair restraints clicked into place.

Julia casually bent the restraints back out of the way. The squeal of stressed titanium filled the room. She stood up. "Um... no, thank you."

A klaxon sounded as one of the technicians slammed on a big red button. The room quickly filled with soldiers.

"Director Tarquin, what are those guns doing here? This seems dangerous."

"Miss Julia, we've been friendly up to this point, but I'm afraid I really must insist." He waved a hand to indicate that she should sit back in the chair.

"Yeah... still no. I mean they are dangerous for all of you. We found out three days ago that I'm invulnerable to bullets. You all could be hit by the ricochets though." She started to weave her way through the crowded room.

"Arrest her, you idiots!" The director started pointing at soldiers, but Julia just calmly shrugged off the hands of the two that tried to grab her, then lifted the one blocking the doorway and set him off to the side.

Julia turned to address the room. "So, it's been fun. Thanks for the superpowers. Do you guys validate parking? You know, I'll just check with the receptionist on the way out."
