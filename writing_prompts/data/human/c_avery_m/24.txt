Golbur and his warband rode their battlecats into the village square, screaming their warcries. "Fear not, human villagers, though we have long been enemies, today, in your darkest hour we ride to save you."

The villagers didn't actually see the Goblins as enemies. A six inch kitten-rider is hardly the type to strike fear into the hearts of such hardy folk. They kept down the rodent population and for that the villagers left out milk and cheese and overlooked the occasional raid that resulted in the loss of a couple of Farmer Tarquin's watermelons.

The villagers were all in the village square, around the large fire that the goblins had seen from their enclave on the hill next to the river. One stood forth.

"What are you doing here?" Golbur wasn't sure which human it was. They all looked alike to him.

"We come to save you, in your darkest hour. Is this not your darkest hour? The prophecy was pretty clear. We read the stars and moon and everything. Plus the big fire."

The human crouched down to talk to Golbur. "We're just celebrating Midwinter's Night, the longest night of the year. That's the bonfire." The other villagers stood where they were but seemed to mumble an assent.

"Well, if it's the longest night, then it must be pretty dark. There ain't no moon or nothing." Golbur, his warband, and the battlecats could see just fine, but they'd all agree that it was a pretty dark night. "Plus the fire smells like bones."

"Yes," said the human. "It's a bonfire. Bone fire. Wards off evil spirits for the winter. Part of the whole ritual." The rest of the humans again mumbled agreement.

"Well, it smells delicious. I don't suppose we could — uh— stay for the party?"

The human considered this. "I'm not sure that's a good idea. I don't think you'd fit in."

Golbur looked around at the rest of the villagers. "Oh— does everybody at the party have to have their hands tied and a bag over their head?"

The human reached a long clawed hand towards Golbur. "I think it's time for you to leave. This is my village now. And I don't like to share."

Golbur's battlecat slashed at the hand with her front paws. The human recoiled and clutched their bleeding hand. Golbur shouted to his warband. "It's trickery. Charge!"

A pile of cats jumped at the human. Soon, their green blood covered the square. The cats feasted.

Golbur looked at the carnage and the villagers tied around the bonfire. "Well, Goblins, you know what this means... Farmer Tarquin's watermelons are unguarded!"
