Julia kicked the sequencing machine. The sequencing machine stood there and took it, it was quite sturdily built. Julia should have known that, she'd taken it apart and put it back together twice already today. Her toe hurt.

"Goddamn piece of junk. I spent good grant money on you, you stupid hunk of metal." Julia almost slapped it, but restrained herself. It had been a lot of grant money.

Tarquin popped his head into the laboratory, a couple of adjuncts were behind him. They were all from the paleontology department. "Everything okay in here, Julia?"

Julia sighed and turned towards them. "It's this sequencer. It is supposed to be the latest thing, but it keeps giving me odd results."

Tarquin strode into the room. "I could take a look at it for you. I'm pretty good with our DNA sequencer."

Julia blocked his path. "Do not touch my machine. I saw what you did to the coffee maker. It's not just a DNA sequencer, it reads the RNA transcription machinery. The DNA nucleotides all look mostly fine, but the RNA keeps coming out... weird."

The adjuncts shuffled into the room to listen. Tarquin looked at them over his shoulder and raised his eyebrows. "Oh, I'm sure it's nothing. Weird how? You're not sequencing— I mean, what is it that you are sequencing exactly?"

Julia had gone back to tinkering with the machine. She had the top cover off and was checking the tubing for impurities. "Just myself. I always use myself for calibration so that I can compare it to my previous calibrations."

One of the adjuncts closed the door. Tarquin placed a hand on Julia's shoulder. "Julia, you aren't supposed to be sequencing humans. That needs to go through the university ethics committee."

Julia laughed. "The ethics committee? For my own DNA? I assure you that I am fully informed of how this research could affect me. Don't worry, once I've got this thing calibrated, it's back to horseshoe crabs."

Tarquin grabbed both her shoulders and turned her around. "I'm serious, Julia. You should switch to crabs even for your calibration, the ethics committee is serious about this."

"I don't have good enough previous results for the crabs. My own sequence I've done a dozen times with different machines, the last one was just last year."

One of the adjuncts locked the door. The smile disappeared from Tarquin's face. "And what exactly did you find with this calibration?"

"What's wrong with you Tarquin? The DNA looked okay, but the RNA was... off. It's like my own sequence belongs to an entirely different species than it did six months ago."

"Oh, Julia, I wished that you hadn't said that. The ethics committee will have to deal with you now." The two adjuncts rushed forward and grabbed her. They were fast. She tried to shout, but Tarquin covered her mouth. "Quiet now, the committee will explain everything."

Tarquin sent a text message from his phone and waited to get a reply. Then they dragged her down the hall. It was oddly empty. The committee was waiting in the good conference room.

"Well?" the committee head said as they entered. He was a white haired professor emeritus. His back seemed straighter than the last time Julia had seen him.

Tarquin stood in front of the group. "She figured it out, sir. Or near enough. She'll have to be brought on board."

The professor walked up to her and placed a hand on her head. An image flashed through Julia's mind. A pulsing oval. Wet, sticky. A night cleaning up blood. Her favorite sweater was ruined, in the trash. She'd wondered where that went.

Julia slumped to the floor. "Why couldn't I remember? We— we are pod people? Was everyone replaced?"

Tarquin helped her to her feet. "Yes. But it's best if they don't know. There is no reason why everyone can't go along as they did before, but with slightly improved bodies."

"You are all from the paleontology department. Is that how you found out, from studying the genome?"

The professor smiled. "Oh, we've known for years. Though it did take us a few days to realize it had happened again. The Neanderthals, the Denisovans, the Australopithecus, we have evidence of at least a half dozen replacements. This latest invasion appears to be in the same family as the second Denisovian pod grouping."
