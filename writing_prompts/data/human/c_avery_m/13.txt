The voice in the back of my head offered me powers beyond my understanding. However, my understanding is quite limited, so getting beyond that was not difficult. And my goddess could be a bit of a taskmaster.

When I told my goddess that I wanted great strength, she responded by making me do a hundred sit-ups, push-ups, and squats, followed by a ten kilometer run. Every single day. So far it has toned me up, but I wouldn't classify my strength as particularly great. In fact, I would stop doing it if I could, but my goddess no longer gives me a choice.

Things had started out better. When I'd first sacrificed myself to... myself, my goddess and I had agreed on everything. Why shouldn't we, since we both had all the same memories and experiences. But she didn't have to experience the aching muscles anymore. According to her, that was the sacrificial vessel's job.

Sure, my body was rockin' now, but goddess did I miss ice cream. She kept saying that my body was her temple and I wasn't going to attract any more worshipers unless I kept it tight. I remember my old church used to throw Ice Cream Socials, and those would attract all sorts. I know she remembers, too, but my arguments are falling on deaf... ears? Deaf rear portion of skull? Deaf interdimensional bubble? (I never did pay attention in Applied Theology class.)

I shower quickly and put on my second work uniform. I don't like working three jobs, but she wants the money, and it's a sacrifice she's willing to make.
