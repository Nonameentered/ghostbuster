Julian couldn't stop shaking. He added more lemon to his tea and took a long sip to calm his body. His mind was still racing.

Tarquina watched him for a minute from the other side of the break room. They were both wearing identical purple jumpsuits, some bureaucrat's idea of a good uniform for a Psy-Corps officer. She was drinking coffee.

"Bad one?" she asked after his face stopped twitching. "Who you got, that murderer in 5B? It's not the rich douche in room 3, is it? Let me know if you need a mindwipe after you write your report. You don't need to be taking that stuff home with you."

Julian blinked and raised his head. His eyes refused to focus on anything. When he finally spoke, his voice twitched and stuttered. "No, no, no. No report. I was in 7A. Didn't get anything. Nothing out of him."

Tarquina sat down next to him at the break room table. "That little mouth-breather? Julian, you're a Level Two now, you gotta break through those little mental blocks they put up against you."

Julian jumped to his feet. “You don't tell me what to do, okay? Don't tell me what we might do, don't tell me what we're supposed to do, don't tell me what we maybe should do, don't ever tell me nothing!”

Tarquina held up her hands. "Sorry, I didn't mean to set you off."

"No, no. It's fine, Tarquina. That's a quote. From a movie. Gigli. The kid was throwing them at me for an hour."

Tarquina hid her face behind her coffee mug and tried to suppress her chuckling. "The kid blocked you with movie quotes? From Gigli?"

"He had the voices, the cadence, everything, even the grunts. It was like a slow motion train wreck. I couldn't concentrate on anything beneath the quotes." Julian buried himself in his tea mug.

Tarquina laughed out loud now and stood up. "Okay, dude. I'll take this kid for you, give him the Level Three Full Visual treatment. You gotta take the rich douche, though."

Julian smiled up at her. "Yes. Yes. Done. Anybody else."

\--------------------------------

The rich douche collapsed on the interrogation table. Julian was just writing down the last of the secret Swiss account numbers into his report when he heard the alarm.

Stepping out into the corridor, he saw the med team rushing for room 7A. When the white-clad orderlies came back out, they held a struggling figure between them, Tarquina. She elbowed one of them, freeing her right hand, then kneed the other in the stomach, doubling him over.

When she saw Julian, she ran up to him, her eyes wild. "You warned me, I should have listened. Make them mindwipe me. Please. It hurts so much. The images are seared in my brain."

"Gigli?"

"No. Worse. So much worse. I can read visuals. It was Cats. The movie. The whole movie. I didn't know it was so bad."

She collapsed as one of the orderlies stuck a hypodermic into her neck. A peaceful look came over her face. She was catatonic.
