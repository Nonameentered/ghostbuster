It felt right to lock the chains in place. The manacles were steel, cold and heavy, and brought with them a sense of relief. Not having to fight anymore seemed like true freedom.

"I'm ready for my fate. But know that this will not end with me, the forces of justice will hunt you for the rest of your life. You will never know peace, and for that my sacrifice is worth it. I do not regret a life lived serving justice. My blood will be— Uh— what are you doing?" The Yellow Knight wiped some of the blood out of his eyes and saw Thorntrex sitting there with her chains. The twisted scowl that had marred her face for over a decade was gone.

Thorntrex opened her eyes and looked at the Knight. "Oh, sorry, did you need medical attention? Your friends will be here soon, I think. I can hear them running. Yes, they are very close now, it's almost over."

The Knight began to struggle to his feet. "You won't use me as a trap for my friends, Thorntrex. I'm not bait for your twisted games you little—"

She held up her chained hands to interrupt him. "Oh, call me Julia. That Thorntrex thing is over now. I'm ready to surrender, see. Honestly, I would have surrendered at the beginning of the fight, but you launched right into attacking me without giving me much of a chance."

The Knight got to his feet. Blood streamed down his arms and dripped from his fingertips until he clenched them into fists. He scanned the room carefully. "I'm sick of your schemes, Thorntrex."

"Julia, please. My therapist says that it's important that I disassociate myself from that damage. Thorntrex will never heal, I see that now. But Julia just might get past it all. I think it's a good thing that we did end up fighting today. I always would have wondered. I would have worried that she would come back, to struggle against me, but the fight made it clear that she was gone. I don't need her. Hell, the only time I ever won a fight against you was without her." She settled back down on her knees and straightened her back, facing the door. The footsteps were close enough now that even the Knight could hear them.

"In here," he yelled. "I've subdued the suspect." When she raised an eyebrow, he continued in a whisper. "Don't think this will fool our doctors."

"Oh, I hope they are good. The psilocybin has been helpful, but honestly, my therapist is a little... back alley. I think I still have room to grow."
