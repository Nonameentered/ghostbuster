Once upon a time, two children lived on a small farm next to a dark wood. The children were brother and sister and their names were Jack and Julia. It was a poor farm, with only a single ancient droid to manage the crops, and no one else seemed to live on the farm with them anymore.

They had once had parents, at least according to the neighbors who sometimes stopped by, but those visits were so infrequent that the neighbors never gave Jack and Julia the same story about what their parents were like or what had happened to them.

Now, Jack had long ago gotten it into his head that it was his job to take care of the farm and his sister, and Julia had long ago gotten it into her head that it was her job to take care of her brother and fix the droid, and the droid had long ago gotten it in it's circuits that it was it's job to grow and harvest as many potatoes as possible and didn't give two bits about the children. The farm was small and the potatoes did not sell very well, but at least the children always had enough to eat.

One day, after a breakfast of potato pie with a hashbrown crust, washed down with very pulpy mugs of potato juice, Jack and Julia decided that they were tired of potatoes, and went out to the small garden they kept, hoping to find that their strawberries had ripened. What they found, instead, was a break in the garden fence, and the ancient droid ripping up their garden to plant more potatoes.

"No, droid, no! We can't live off of only potatoes." Jack and Julia rushed to stop it, but knew they were too late. Their strawberries were gone.

"Mark Six Agriculture Mono Potatoes are engineered to contain all essential vitamins, minerals, and proteins. They are well suited for poor soils and a variety of climate conditions and allow for multiple yearly harvests. They are the ideal crop for this farm."

Jack and Julia sat and cried, ignoring the droid's speech. They'd heard it many times before. It was, in fact, the only thing that the droid ever said, other than reports on the status of the season's crop.

Jack had had enough. "I can't eat another potato. I'm going to forage for something, anything that doesn't taste like dirt."

"The meadows will be empty this time of year, and the old orchards are picked over." Julia knew they'd taken the last apples the previous week.

"Well, then I'll go into the woods. There's got to be something in there." Jack said this confidently, but in fact they had never been in the woods. Despite the trees being visible from anywhere on their farm, they'd grown up fearing them.

Julia was just about to argue that this plan was impossible when the droid spoke. "The forest is a protected area. Entry is prohibited."

Julia turned to the droid. "Yes, we know you can't grow potatoes there. We were talking about looking for other things."

"Your mother specifically prohibited your entry into the forest when she went there to search for your father. The forest is protected."

Jack and Julia tried for hours to get the droid to tell them more about their parents, or even to repeat that one sentence. It said nothing and returned to the crops.

Jack and Julia argued over it all evening, but at dawn they both shouldered a backpack of potatoes and set off into the forest.
