The chain connecting her pen to her clipboard was the same style as the chain on her glasses. Pink, with little kitten charms on it, the only piece of color in her outfit. The rest of her uniform was dusty gray, a classically cut suit that could have been from any time in the last century, or possibly the next.

"Time/Space Coordinates of Destination?" she said with a sigh.

Tarquin stared at her for a second. She'd just shown up when he turned on the time machine for the first time. Somehow unlocked the door — No, he could see from here that the deadbolt was still turned — somehow opened the still-locked door and stepped inside from some place that did not look like his hallway.

"Vienna, 1908. Uh— who are you?"

"Time Bureaucrat," she said flatly. "This your first time?"

When he just stared blankly at her, she didn't wait for him to answer. "Do you have your completed Form H-112: Hitler Art School Acknowledgement?"

"I didn't know there was a form involved."

The Bureaucrat rolled her eyes at him and detached a form from her clipboard. "Fill this out."

Tarquin stared at the paper. It was mostly filled with legalese, telling him the punishment for trying to get Adolf Hilter accepted into Art School. Even without knowing what a 'Time Smear' was, the punishment seemed painful. "How did you know my plan, and why can't I get him accepted to Art School?"

"I get like one of you a week. There is no other reason for a first timer to choose 1908 Vienna for their destination. If it was up to you idiots we'd end up back in the Goring/Dewey timeline." She shuddered, then continued in a monotone. "Your current clothing is unacceptable due to the Regulation N117.3.4b: Nylon. An approved set of clothing can be provided upon payment of a fee of $65.00 adjusted for inflation from 1970 to local time. Currency exchange is available."

"I'll just change my socks. Though, if I can't change the timeline, what's the point. I'm not a big fan of Vienna. Where do you think I should go?"

"Time Bureaucrats are not permitted to suggest coordinates for timeline change. Regulation T3.1.1a. If you're not going to fill it out, can I have my form back?"

"What if I don't want to change anything?"

The Bureaucrat took her glasses off, letting them hang on their cat-chains. With a sigh, she began to thumb through her clipboard until she found a small card. "Here. You didn't get that from me."

Tarquin looked down at the card. When he looked up the Bureaucrat was gone. He shrugged and walked over to the controls on his machine, dialing it to "Trinity College, Cambridge, June 28th, 2009."

"No RSVP Required, eh? Might be a fun party."
