"No, you stay with the car. I'm just going in for groceries. Stay. Sit. Good house." Julia checked on the knot holding the hut to her Subaru's hitch. If nobody looked too closely they wouldn't notice that the supposed trailer's wheels were just bolted on.

Julia heard a loud shifting as she turned towards the store. She whipped her head around to give the hut one last look, but it was just settling its legs. The free housing was nice and never needing to clean was great, but having a walking house had some downsides. Not least of which was that its cooking was still awful. Well, the borscht was excellent, but Julia got tired of having it for every meal.

The hut had been a gift from Grandma Yaga for graduating college. As much as Julia tried to explain that a hydrological engineer's work was not the same as dowsing for water, Granny Yaga winked and insisted that she knew a witch when she smelled one, and that if Julia wasn't a witch she wouldn't wear pants so often.

At least the hut made it easy to take jobs in remote locations. At the moment she was on her way to a four week stint in the middle of North Dakota. The hut had no trouble keeping up with the car as long as she drove at night to avoid people noticing the legs. Which led her here, to a 24 hour grocery store in the middle of a prairie state at two in the morning. With luck the store would be out of beets.

Four weeks of food, even for one person, took up two carts. Well, most of the second cart was alcohol. Julia had found spreading it liberally around at new work sites both helped make friends and kept down the believability of stories about a house with legs.

She didn't see the man until he grabbed her arm. "Hey sweetie, how 'bout you share some of that, eh?"

She let out a yelp. "Let go of me!" The man was dressed in a dirty winter coat and already stank of booze. He probably weighed twice what she did. She tried to pull her arm away but he held her fast. She punched him weakly in the chest, but she just squeezed harder.

"Bitch! Girl like you should be friendly to a guy." The man let a greasy sneer come over his face. "I'll show you what we do to bitches, you little â€” ugh."

An eight foot chicken leg kicked the man hard enough to fly him into the side of the store. Julia looked up at the ragged rope where the hut had clawed through its leash again and patted it on the leg. "Good boy."

Turning to where the man held his head groaning, Julia grabbed her carts and started pulling them back to the car. "Not a bitch. But close."

Julia smiled to herself. She did wear pants a lot.
