It was not their fault that the idol was unnecessarily fragile. It had survived untold eons sitting in the dusty nook of the abandoned temple. But the earthquake that started as soon as the statue shattered against the floor was very concerning. The only exit sealing itself off was also an issue.

"I told you that those were load-bearing spiderwebs. You shouldn't have cleaned it. Hells, you shouldn't have touched it." Tarquin was rooting through his bag as he mumbled further complaints. "Let me see if I can figure out what we've awakened."

Julia stared at the pile of broken stone that she had previously hoped to sell for a year's wages. Maybe there were some gems or something in there. She scattered the pile with her foot. Nothing but stone. The rumbling intensified.

"Stop that. You're making it angrier," Tarquin screamed at her. He had brought out a small tome and was paging through it.

"That was an idol to—" He stopped on the last page of the book, illustrated with a bright red curlicue that exactly matched the one that had previously adorned the statue. "Fuck."

"Please tell me you mean it was a fertility goddess." Tarquin handed the book to Julia and started pulling items out of his bag. Julia couldn't read most of the page, but the illustrations were particularly illuminating. "That is a lot of teeth."

When she looked back up, Tarquin had pulled a box of potions out of his bag. He drank one and handed one to her. She held it gingerly, nearly dropping it as another tremor shook the temple. "We can't drink these. What if we need them later?"

Tarquin was downing a second potion and pulling a pile of single-use scrolls out of his inventory. "That's the best part, Julia. There's not going to be a later. All this shit we've been hauling around thinking that it might be useful 'later' but never using because we didn't want to waste it? Well, today is 'later'. To late, probably."

The altar was beginning to glow. Julia shotgunned a couple potions and pulled a cloth bundle from her own pack. She hesitated. "Tarquin, this arrow is worth more than my house. I can't just— shoot it."

"Don't worry about that, Julia, you'll be dead before it hits." There was a small pile of empty bottles next to Tarquin. He seemed taller and she was pretty sure his eyes hadn't always been purple. Julia rushed to catch up.

Cracks began to appear in the altar. Tarquin busied himself activating scrolls and letting them burn themselves to ash. Julia was certain he didn't use to have horns, but then her skin didn't use to be made of jade.

She took aim with her arrow as the teeth burst through. "Tarquin, this is going to be GLORIOUS."

"Yeah, Julia. It's been nice knowing you."

The Soul Gnasher later described them as "a real fun challenge" and "surprisingly delicious".
