Naxos was a long slim cat, half Siamese with a light mottled coloring that reminded Julia of the marble from the Greek island that gave the cat her name. Julia wasn't usually one to take in stray animals, but when she first saw the cat hiding from the rain on her doorstep, soaked, she let her in to warm by the fire, and fed her, and after that Julia was her owner, as far as Naxos was concerned. She got out all the old cat stuff from where it had been stowed in the garage and that was that.

The dead mouse on her bed the next morning was a little concerning, but since the mouse had obviously been inside the house already she decided that she preferred it to whatever the creature had been doing before it got to her bed.

"Good job, Naxos," she said, stroking the cat's fur. "But you can keep that. Mice aren't really my thing."

The next morning she was awoken by a lot of movement on the bed. Without opening her eyes, she mumbled to Naxos to settle down.

"Oh, sorry," said a deep voice from beside her. Julia jumped out of bed and scrambled for the wooden dowel she kept under her nightstand as a weapon. She saw the source of the voice was a handsome, half-naked man.

"Who are you? What are you doing here? I'm calling the police. Get out."

The man raised his hands in surrender to the stick she waved in front of him. "Sorry, the cat made me come in here. I think it was supposed to be a surprise, but I realize — yeah — thinking about it now... It's kind of weird. Imma head out."

Naxos was sitting at the bedroom door as the man left. Julia gave her a look. "You should be preventing strange men from coming into my bed. Especially ones that are — I'm gonna say drunk? No men in my bed." The cat seemed to nod and sauntered off.

The next morning, Julia was again awakened by a lot of movement on her bed. She reached out a hand towards her dowel. "That better not be a drunk guy," she said before opening her eyes.

"The cat told me to come here," said the woman sitting on the bed. She was not nearly as half-naked as the man. In fact, she was wearing an old sweater covered in cat hair.

"Out, you crazy person," Julia said, pointing with her dowel. "Cat's can't talk and I'm getting new locks."

"Well, Naxos said you needed company and weren't into men."

"I'm into men just fine. Get out. Cats can't talk. Naxos, can you talk?"

"No," said the cat.

"See. I've known that cat three days and she's never lied to me."

When the woman had left, Julia turned to the cat. "Did you talk before?"

"Meow," said the cat.

"That sounded like you just said the word meow instead of actually meowing."

"Purr," said the cat, rubbing up against her leg.

"Imma get some coffee."

The next morning, Julia was again awakened by a lot of movement on her bed. She already had the dowel in her hand under the blanket. "That better not be a person," she said. "If it is and the cat told you to come here, just leave. The locksmith is coming today."

When no answer came, she peeked open an eye. Naxos was sitting on the bed, next to a pile of cash.

"Where did you get this?"

"Um— Meow?" Naxos responded, refusing to look Julia in the eyes.

"I don't need these gifts. You can stay here without them."

Naxos bent to pick up one of the bundles of bills in her teeth, and began to take it away.

"Wait. Since it's already here you can leave it. Just stick to mice in the future."

"Okay. Purr," said the cat.

Julia squinted at Naxos and pursed her lips. "And cats can't talk."
