Long has this duty lain upon me. Alone against the horde, I guard the entrance to the land. The days and nights blend together when duty is the only true purpose. While I still live, none shall pass beyond me.

The cloud of dust betrays their approach. All day I stand watching the column creep closer. The rhythm of their boots fall into a pattern that shakes the ground. I plant my sword and stand firm. As the army comes to the foot of my bridge, the lead figure holds up a hand and the marching stops.

Gold and silver is his armor. Bright shining the sword at his side. The matched spearmen abreast of him lowered their weapons to threaten me, but I gave forth nary a shiver. The golden knight lifted his visor and his piercing blue eyes alit upon me. "Excuse us, sorry for being a bother, but we're just trying to march through here. Could you just— tck— scoot to the side for a sec?"

His insolence awakened a great anger in me. A lifetime of training kept me anchored to my post. Only blood could move me. Only one response could answer his challenge. "Oh— sorry, no. No can do. Nobody's allowed past here. Rules and all."

"This is a real sticking point, then. No exceptions?" I nodded solemnly. "Well... swords then?"

My answer was a swing at his neck. The Golden Knight ducked under it and responded with a quick thrust against my pauldron, knocking me off balance. I leaned into the motion and brought my sword around for a chop at his legs, forcing him to jump back.

His spearmen moved to surround me, but the Golden Knight waved them back. As we circled each other, I threw out a couple of quick feints, testing his defenses. My third feint turned into a hard thrust at his side. As it glanced off his armor, I felt a sharp pain under my sword arm.

My sword clattered to the ground as my arm fell uselessly at my side, blood streaming down my black armor. I fell to a knee.

"Good show. Well done. Shall I have one of our medics patch you up as we go through?"

"Oh, no thanks. I'm not done here." I clutched my sword with my off hand and struggled to my feet.

"We're carrying on then? Alright, if you insist." The Golden Knight lifted his sword into a guard position.

My first swing was wild and he easily dodged to the side. He hopped around my next two swings without lifting his own sword. I growled and charged him, hoping to run him through. A blinding white pain filled my vision as his blade sliced into my other arm. My sword fell from my grip.

"Very brave of you. My personal doctor will ensure you live. No, if you'll excuse me, I must get back to marching."

"That's still going to be a no. Sworn duty and all." I lowered my pointed helmet and charged.

My attack took the Golden Knight by surprise. My helmet bashed against his, forcing up his visor. The peacock plume upon my crest tickled his nose, devastating him. As I drew back my neck for a second strike, he sliced my left leg, knocking me to the ground against the rocks of the cliff wall next to the bridge.

The Golden Knight signaled to his army to begin marching. I looked him in the eyes one last time and shouted. "Stop. Tis but a scratch!"

I tried to use my remaining leg to trip them as they marched past over the bridge. Three limbs down, but my helmet still hid my smile. The rock was firm against my back. The rock hiding the true secret entrance to my land.
