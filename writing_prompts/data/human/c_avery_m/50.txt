Princess Julia arranged her hair into the high conical hat before taking another look in the mirror. As she was tucking the last bit of braid under the veil, the mirror began to swirl with a foggy image. A red-eyed visage stared forth at her, rows of sharp teeth plunging out of a long snout. A snarl issued forth from the mirror.

"Draco!" the princess hopped back in surprise. "What are you doing? Don't call me on the home mirror, dad might sense it."

The smoke-dark dragon's snarl twisted into a laugh. "Then keep your compact mirror on. I've been trying to call you for an hour. I'm almost there."

The princess grabbed her compact from the dressing table and clicked it open. The magic was dim. "Oops. Sorry. I'll be down in a minute."

She slipped the compact into the pocket of her dress and ran out the bedroom door and down the tower's spiral stairs. When she got to the bottom, she slowed to a walk. The door to her father's study was cracked open. She could hear her mother's soft voice inside distracting him as she slipped past.

She stood in front of the castle gates and opened her compact. The mirror shifted from her own face to the face of the dragon. "Okay, Draco. I'm ready."

\-----------------------------------

Duke Razuta the Immortal was drinking his nightly breakfast to the soothing sound of his wife's voice when he heard the scream. "What is that girl doing now? Mina, send one of the servants to check on her."

Mina stopped singing. "Oh, I'm sure it's nothing. I'll go check on it myself." As she ran out of the room, the Duke heard a large crash. He downed the last of his breakfast in a single gulp and floated after her.

The entry hall was in disarray when he arrived. The gates were open, blasting the room with cold air. The Duke could see new claw marks scratched into the stone floor, layered over the old claw marks. "That dragon has kidnapped her again."

His wife stood near the gate talking with two young men. He floated over to hear them, but as he approached Mina turned to him. "My Lord Duke, these young men saw the whole incident. It seems that the dragon has kidnapped Princess Julia once again. It is a tragedy."

The duke floated stoically. "Not a tragedy. It's simple tradition. In my day a decent princess was kidnapped at least once a month. Far too little of it nowadays if you ask me. It's not right for princesses to go off and be independent. We'll just get a knight to go rescue her."

The taller of the two young men stepped forward at these words. "Your Grace, I happened to be a knight. And my companion here is a sorcerer. We saw the dragon approach your castle and pursued it, but were too late to stop the kidnapping. It would be our honor to rescue your daughter."

"Ah, a fine young traditionalist I see. I approve. You'll receive the standard reward of her weight in silver when she is returned."

The young man bowed. "Yes, your grace. Could we perhaps have some ready money for expenses during our pursuit?"

\-----------------------------------

Julia perched on top of Draco at the edge of the forest and watched the knight and sorcerer run out the castle gates. When they came even with her hiding spot, she called out in a loud whisper. "Over here. Did you get the money?"

The knight and sorcerer crawled on top of the dragon. "Sure did. Let's go. The concert starts in an hour."
