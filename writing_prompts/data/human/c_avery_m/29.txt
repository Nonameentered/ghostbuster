I make a point of going back to look at each piece after I've slept on it and critiquing it in my private sub. But I also always point out the parts I liked best. For example in [yesterday's piece](https://www.reddit.com/r/c_avery_m/comments/ud842t/wp_magicians_are_quite_rare_they_are_not_born/) I liked the ending but I feel I chickened out a bit on the climax and toned it down to meet the sub's rules.
