I said this in the chat but it's good to repeat!

There are a lot of great concepts in the dialogue, perfectly kid-like, but sometimes the dialogue itself sounds a little too old for kids of that age. Reading it again, it kinda bleeds a touch into the actions they take. For example, I personally feel like kids giggle instead of chuckle, or for example, I don't think Samantha intentionally 'paused' she 'maybe 'thought' but I doubt she was thinking about pacing.   


These are all nitpicks because the story itself is VERY solid and concept / themeing is very strong :)
