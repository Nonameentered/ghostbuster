Did you know that the majority of our history can be traced through a cascades of accidents and good intentions? It's the popular theory that this would be the same for all sentient species but this hasn't been proven by even our most esteemed scientists. 

But it is true that our history, the history of the Anteraki, has been coloured by missteps. When a young boy was attempting to create a inflammbale chemical he accidentally created rubber! When rebel princess Krintaka was trying to create an economic policy to revolutionize inter-continent underground shipping, instead she created the loopholes that allowed farmers to become the highest caste, as they always should have been.

Most accidents had silver linings as long as you looked at them from the right way, in fact, most of them we're hard to find at all. So all I needed to do was....

Well I needed to find the silver lining for the fact that my mentor, Dr. Lunitrai was quite literally missing his head. As it turned out, walking in front of the high-speed mailing cannon I was developing had been bad for his health. 

I also would have had more time to find the silver lining on this event is another member of the faculty, Dr. Vertas hadn't walked in to check on the progress for my life's work. Frankly I don't know why my first instinct, needing more time afterall, was to turn the cannon to their direction to distract them for a moment with a shot. 

So allow me a small correction, I needed to find a silver lining in half of the artifice faculty being splattered across the floor as if they'd finally met their death day. 

Was I just going to try to deny it? It was quite the accident and the only other two people that had seen it happen were... out of commission. There wasn't anyone filming because I hadn't announced the test so there was nothing to film. As far as the world was concerned, this had just been an accident without hands invovled. Afterall, if I wasn't here, how were they supposed to know what happened?  Why would someone shoot another person with a cannon anyway? It was an action that made NO sense.

I took a deep breath and smoothed my feelers back against my scalp. I was just going to walk out of here and be fine, nothing NEEDED to happen to me, I could just zip-a-dee-do-da out the back and say I hadn't been in the office today. No harm, no foul. 

Or at least everyone would think  there had been no harm, which was the exact same thing as NOT doing harm right? Equivillent. 

It was perfect, until Prodisk, the friendly janitor who had always brought we cupcakes on my spawn day walked into the room and stared at me with my hands still on the trigger of the high speed mail cannon as Dr. Vertas slumped down to the floor. 

"Well boy oh boy what happened here," Prodisk asked as he looked down at the two bodies on the floor of the room, "something wild must have just happened to- phew, well just look at them."

"Um- ah," I tactfully responded. 

"Becuase howdy this is quite the circumstnace, but you can probably figure out what happened, right Dr. Regital?" Prodisk looked at me with somehow both expectant and pained eyes.

"Yeah I was just, um , I was just about to check the cannon to see who had been sending mail that might have-" he could probably hear my chitin clicking. "might have been playing around with my machine before we knew how dangerous it was to- uh."

"Gonna be honest," Prodisk began, "it does seem mightly unlikely that someone might have done all this and just ran out. They could have just said it was an accident and don't know what would happen but it's probably better th-" Prodisk stopped, mostly becuase I was pulled the trigger on the mail cannon several seconds before when I'd heard 'unlikely story' as opposed to anything else he said. "Ah beans," he managed, "that hurts."

Prodisk fell to the floor. Two accidents and- and a what? I had meant to do that, I knew exactly what was going to happen, I'd seen it twice already, and I'd still done it just to stop him in case what he said was going to hurt me. I didn't know what to call that-

But the previous two had been accidents, and as I closed the door behind me in the office, left hand still shaking as it felt the weight of what it had just done, I realized that nothing was going to come from this accident. I didn't need to volunteer for exile, I didn't need to spend the rest of my life alone. I'd taken away accountability and I could just keep living. 

They were probably going to call my mail cannon too dangerous for the public, but I needed to ask if I could keep it as a souvineer, who knew when there would be another accident in the futrue that I needed to slip away from?
