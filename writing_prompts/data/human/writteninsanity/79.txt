"Wait, wait, wait, wait," I started as the man bellowed something at me. I hadn't caught what he'd said, but he was built like he built brick houses and then ate them. He was holding out an impossibly muscled arm to help me off of the freezing ground. "What is going on?!"

"You have joined us!" He said with a smile that was supposed to be welcoming. You earned a glorious death and were burned in the proper ways," he pulled a horn off of his belt as I accepted his hand. "Now you may fight for eternity!" He blew into the horn, and a chorus of cheers echoed over the white around me.

Wait. It was white. It had been black since I'd died.

WAIT. I DIED?!

"Warrior! Eyes up!" the man who'd blown the horn called before unshackling a battleaxe the size of a Honda Civic off of his belt.  He took a moment to unshackle a small dagger on his belt and tossed it to me.

I jumped out of the way.

"You're going to need that warrior," the man said with a hearty chuckle. "Trust me."

"Are you God?" I asked.

"Odin's not my father! My Dad's on the other side today!" The man raised his axe and charged into the white. The ground was shaking. Why was the ground shaking?

What was-

The fog faded away for a moment, and all I saw was a mass of writhing bodies, gleaming metal and pouring blood.

"Jesus Christ," I said, taking a step away and leaning down to pick up the dagger I'd been tossed.

"WELCOME, BOY!" came a call from behind me. I started standing straight up to turn around, and the last thing I felt was the axe in the back of my neck.

\---

I snapped my eyes open with the feeling of steel fresh in my neck. I opened my mouth to scream, but I wasn't being attacked anymore. I- it must have been a dream. A horrifying, deadly dream.

That said, this definitely wasn't my suite in Manhattan, and this absolutely wasn't my bed. What had happened during that tri-

There was a brutal pounding at the door, with each pound hitting like a battering ram. I sat up stock straight, and suddenly, I felt the best I'd ever felt in my life. No back pain; my knee wasn't doing that weird thing. Heck, my neck wasn't even stiff.

The door cracked open after a polite amount of pounding, and the massive golem of a man that I'd seen in my dream earlier stepped into the room. That means- Holy shit, that had been real. I died. I'd been killed. Wait- He said I'd died to get to the place where I lost my head, so did that mean I'd died twi-

"Aye, ya made it, man," the behemoth said in a voice that felt like a warm hug when it wasn't used for battle cries, "I recognize that look."

"Utter confusion?" I asked.

"Aye, some people aren't confident that their death was glorious enough to enter these halls. It's quite an adjustment-" the man surveyed my room, stroking his lengthy but immaculately kept beard as he did. "A bit boring, ain't it?"

"What?" I asked as I almost sprang out of bed. When was the last time I'd been this lithe? "I am-"

"Did your family not send your trophies with you?" he asked. "A warrior without his-" he took a deep breath and shook his head, "a sad sight to see."

"My trophies?" I asked. Like middle school soccer?

"Aye, yer trophies are back home if they didn't come to Valhalla with ya," he crossed his arms and looked at the bare walls, "I have a few that I keep in a chest because I ain't got room to hang em, may-"

"Wait," I cut him off once I caught up with what he'd been saying. "Valhalla? That Viking place?"

"Aye," he said, "though you calling us the Vikings makes me think you're an Englishman."

"We're both speaking English," I pointed out, "but I'm Canadian."

"Lad, we're speaking the God's tongue," he said, "and I don't know what a Canadian is, but it sounds better than an Englishman."

"Thanks," I said. Wait a second. We were getting way too into the weeds about this. Was I really in fucking Valhalla? "Am I really in?"

"Aye, ya made it."

"I-" I flopped back down onto the bed and took a deep breath. I had been asked for a Viking burial as a joke, and my brother had promised me he'd do it. How did I die? I remembered the courtroom, the Murder Trial for the Jenkin's Twins, but- "I died?"

"Aye, struck down from behind," the massive man scoffed, "though Brigmar did shout to let you know he was comin'."

"Wh-" Want to know what? I was going to let him talk. I wasn't about to get anywhere with stupid questions.

"Aye, ya died quick in the battle. No man wants to win by surprise, but if you don't turn around, I'm not sure what he was supposed to do-" he stomped over to my bed, looming over me and holding out the same friendly had that had been my first sight upon arriving here. "Now come on, there are lots about people who want to meet you."

"Me?" I asked.

"Of course," he grabbed my arm and yanked me up before I'd had a proper chance to extend it. "Nobody new has arrived in these halls for over 300 years."

"Valhalla?" I asked.

"The realm of the Gods themselves."

I shook my head; This was fucked up, this was so fucked up. I- Maybe it was better than eternal blackness; I was pretty afraid of the dark.

"The name's Thalmor," the goliath said as he pushed open my door, "yours?"

"Malcolm," I answer.

"Malcolm?" he asked like it was a stranger name than Thalmor. "That can work. I'm glad to fight by your side, Malcolm of Valhalla."
