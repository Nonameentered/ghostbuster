No idea what the Ted from accounting story from a while back would be.

This is notably a rewrite of the first part of a story that I've previously written, Malcolm of Valhalla back in 2017. If it reads similarly to something you read in the past then there is a chance that they were inspired by my piece on my Subreddit :)   


Or it's a coincidence. Who knows! If you thinking of my previous story, then the name has always been Malcolm.
