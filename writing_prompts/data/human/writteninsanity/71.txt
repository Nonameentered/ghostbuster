Hunting was one of the world's oldest professions. Ever since there'd been cities, there had been vermin in them that needed cleansing, and ever since there'd been vermin, there were hunters. 

Professions evolve over the years. Doctors these days don't use leeches, and engineers use computers. That said, hunting had always been a sport of tradition: classic weapons, classic tools, a classy job for fancy people. 

I was not a fancy person. 

My Dad had been a hunter, the classy kind. He'd died back in 2013 when I was off at University. My mom had been a hunter, a fancy lady, and she'd died in 2014 just after we'd buried Dad. 

The guild had written off my hometown before I'd had a chance to move back. There were too many creatures of the night to keep up with, and they'd lost too many fancy people. They'd been good hunters, crossbows, stakes and silver bullets. 

So, my Mom, my Dad and my hometown were in the ground before I'd picked up my membership in the Great Hunt. What kind of hunter did that make me? 

A vengeful one. 

"You bitch," my victim spat as she tried to crawl away from me. Vampires might have had super speed, but it was hard to run when you didn't have legs anymore. "What the-" 

"IED," I explained, "and I don't think I asked you to talk." I walked in front of her, pouring gasoline as I went. 

"That's-" the vampire started, but I cut her off by putting down the jerry can and pulling out a lighter. 

"Hm?" I asked. 

"Please- I'll stop drinking blood."

I tossed the lighter in response and ignited the fuel. There was barely time for a gurgle and a half scream before she was gone. "Yeah, don't drink much when you're dead," I pointed out.  Once I was sure that she wasn't twitching anymore, I picked up the jerry can and wrapped it up in a garbage bag before tucking it back in the backseat of my car before hopping in myself. 

The car rumbled to life, and I cracked open the glove box, grabbing the camels and fresh lighter that fell out. I lit a cigarette before tossing it all back and pulling out my phone. 

I had a list on my phone, typed and formatted beautifully. Evalyn Adams had been at the top of that list, and now she was burning in my rearview mirror. Just as I was about to start looking up the next name on the list, I noticed a car coming down this abandoned road.  I growled and put my phone in the cup holder, pushing the car door open with my black combat boots. 

The car slowed down as it approached, pulling off to the side. Seeing as Evalyn and I were behind the veil, I popped the car's trunk and reached way to the back. There was my personal favourite tool behind my day-bag, piles of stakes, three guns, and a shovel. 

My new friend got out of the car, I could hear him. I turned around and met him with a pneumatic harpoon. He looked down at the gun and then back up at me, his dramatic duster flapping in the sea wind. 

"Alexis," he said. 

"Hunter?" I asked. 

"Out in the daylight, ain't I?" he asked. Evalyn had been out in the daylight, too but in her car. 

"Fair," I nodded and lowered the harpoon slightly. "I don't need help."

"Wasn't offering," he said as he walked past the burning vampire, prodding her with his foot. "You know what's over that bridge?" he asked. 

"Cape Breton," I answered.

"More vampire towns than you can count," he said.

"Yeah."

"They won't respect a hunter like you," he pointed out. 

"Don't need 'em to."

"They'll be on your throat the second you step on-"

"Don't threaten me with a good time," I snapped. "You just here to convince me to go home?" 

"Guild wants you to go home," he corrected. "Lost a lot of good people over there."

"Surprised they approve," I said before throwing the harpoon back in the trunk and heading back to my car door. 

"Where you goin'?" he asked.

"Home," I said before opening the door, "to have a good time."
