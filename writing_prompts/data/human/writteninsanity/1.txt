Dragons blood was a gift, and a rare one to boot. In ages past, Kings and Queens would bargin with dragons for a drop of blood to give to their sons or daughters. It was a sign of power, of royalty and one of the few ways to acquire magic that didn't involve a complete elementary through university edution. 

Dragon's blood was precious, which was why it made sense that Ashton didn't believe a lick of what Pyra was saying when she'd said that she had dragon's blood over drinks.

"You went to Arkivadia for illusion," Ashton pointed out, "why would you bother doing that if you had Dragon's blood?" 

Pyra took a deep breath and tapped her fingers on her coffee. This was why she never brought it up. Legends of dragon's blood had been blown up by the internet and people had become convinced that it was an easy way to skip to the top. Of course, every famous sorcerer claiming they had dragon's blood in the tabloids hadn't helped that issue. "S'not quite like that," she answered after a moment. 

"Yeah because you don't have it,"  Ashton answered, "but like, I don't care. Nobody cares so you don't need to-"

"Not lying about it," Pyra cut him off, "why would I lie about it?"

"Well-"

"I can already do the magic," Pyra crossed her arms, "you know I can."

"Yes," Ashton leaned back to match her energy, "but you didn't want to submit to a blood check for the job right?"

"No I don't."

"Becuase..."

"Because I have dragon's blood and I'm not telling that to a fuckin' internship," Pyra answered. 

"Nothing to do with how crazy Hilde's party got last weekend?"

"No," Pyra answered and uncrossed her arms to grab her coffee, "that was nuts though."

"Yeah, wild." 

Pyra took a sip of her coffee instead of adding anything onto the end of that. She was exhausted, it had been a long day considering the blood problem and looking for other options in the lovely world of unpaid internships. 

"So dragon's blood eh?" Ashton said after a moment, circling the conversation back. 

Pyra put the coffee down and sighed. "Yes."

"How's that happen?"

Pyra frowned and crossed her legs. He wasn't going to drop this, was he? He was going to keep banging on about it until she explained what was going on. This was why she didn't tell people, they'd hyper focus on it. Plus, it made it weird if you started wondering if someone only liked you for your blood. 

Ashton watched her for a moment and then nodded to himself. "So-"

"My grandpa was an adventurer right?"Pyra started just around the same time that Ashton was going to chance the subject. 

"Your parents were too, right?"

"Kinda," Pyra corrected, "but my grandpa was a pretty big name in the rush around the end of the seventh age. You can look him up if you want, it's Londus of Mina Bastion."

"Mhm," Ashton nodded along and pulled out his phone to do just that, but decided to just leave it on the coffee table instead. 

"So he was out with his adventuring party and-" Pyra paused, "he was the bard for the party, and he was the leader too."

"Oh my God so he seduced the dragon?" Ashton asked with bright eyes. 

Pyra rolled hers in response. 

"Sorry, that was dumb," Ashton admitted. 

"Well-" Pyra trailed off for a second, "but you aren't wrong."

"Oh my god."

"Fuck off."

"Sorry."

"So-" Pyra tapped her fingers on the table for a second trying to keep the story straight, "so my grandfather was the head of the party and they took the quest to slay the Great Dragon-" Pyra paused, "hm."

Once Pyra had stopped for long enough Ashton cut in, "You don't know their name?"

"I call her Nana or Granny Sylvia so-" 

"Granny?"

"We're getting there," Pyra pointed out. Ashton grabbed his phone and tried to bring up information on Pyra's grandfather. 

"So, they're set to fight this dragon, but from what Grandpa said there is just no way it was going to happen. Three other parties had already tried and been sent back to town and he said his companions back then were 'part of the new generaton.' "

"It's Sylvitias the Great Dread I think," Ashton jumped in with anwers from the internet. 

"Right! She doesn't really use that name around the house." Pyra took time to take a sip of her coffee, and then a second before putting it back down. "Like I was saying, he was assigned to fight her and they went to her lair."

"That's ambtious."

"Most of the dragon strategy textbooks are from after the Seventh," Pyra pointed out, but she wasn't sure if that was an excuse or a reason, "either way, they are in way over their heads and get smoked."

"Wrecked?"

"Exactly, and Grandpa is the leader so he steps up and tries to make a deal with her."

"So it was a-"

"No."

"Got it."

"Grandma ends up taking him as part of the horde becuase he was a really good bard that had done some tavern circuits and she'd heard of him. So she brought him on as a musician," Pyra folded her hands like she was finished. 

"And then?"

"What? I don't know every detail of how my Grandma and Grandpa hooked up, that'd be weird."

"She's a dragon."

"And my grandmother."

"But-"

"She's always in her human form these days," Pyra pointed out washing away many of the more uncomfortable questions off the table. "I've seen her dragon form like once."

There was a long pause. Ashton went to take a sip of his drink before realizing that it was mostly ice and water at this point. He frowned at his drink before speaking up again. "Yeah fuck the internship don't tell 'em."

"What do I do then?" Pyra asked.

"There are other options that aren't going to ask for a blood test-" then after a moment, "plus aren't you loaded if Grandma had a hoard?"

"That's not my money."

"'I'm not rich my parent's are'" Ashton answered in a mocking voice. 

"I need a job."

"They suck."

"Yeah well," Pyra crossed her arms and took a deep breath, "maybe I just take the test and act like I didn't know." After a second she spoke up again, "Think they'll pay me if they know I have Dragon's Blood?"

"It's an internship. They will not."
