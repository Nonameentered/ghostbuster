Victroya is, in theory, the super hero to this super villain, that said it has been a point I was wondering about. Seeing as the post is in universe, MC wouldn't explain who Victorya is, but reader wise I'd need to. 

In the end I decided the AITA post wouldn't say it, so I cut it for now. It's a weird choice to need to make for a story.
