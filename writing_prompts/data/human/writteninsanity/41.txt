I'd been trained deep in the mountains of Northern Japan. Ice and snow had been my crucible through frigid winters and dripping heat was my forge in the summer. My old life was a dream occasionally remembered in quiet moments, a echo of who I used to be.

That had been the price of mastery. Originally, my quest to become a ninja had been a simple goal, but it had quickly become my life. You can't dabble in ninjitsu, you needed to dedicate yourself, your entirety and your fate to the craft.

After six years of training my master finally told me I was ready for the calling of our order. In the past, we'd been masters of subterfuge and sabotage; we'd changed the world to our preferred image, but these days we had a much more simple order.

A fight against apathy.

The blood of people, over 20000 years of suffering, simply wasn't triggered in the modern day. It was too simple to go through life without any of the highs you need as a person. Sure, there were exceptions, brief moments, but they were uncommon enough that people would fall apart.

That was why I was in the middle of North Dekota, hidden in the deepest shadows of night and waiting for my opportunity. Aly Hammington needed to cry tonight, for the sake of humanitty, and I was the solution.

I kept an eye on her through the window, searching for an opportunity to bring the tears. A funny post or mediocre meme wouldn't do it. I needed something good to come up.

Aly scrolled aimlessy around the internet and I could feel the onions in my satchel growing heavier and heavier. I was running out of time. Soon it would be late enough at night that she would feel guilty about being awake on her phone and that was no time to make someone cry. If we got to that point, I'd have failed my mission.

What if I went in now? I could spark the tears and she would blame it on something she saw earlier and- No. I couldn't do that. My master didn't train me to give up and give in when the chips went down. I was going to make this work.

I watched her end up on a cute animal video on her phone and my hand hovered over the latch of the window. It wasn't the video I needed, but it was something that would surely get sad stories in her reccommended. I couldn't strike yet, but I could get in position to.

Silent I slipped into her home, slicing through the darkness and positioning myself just outside of the room she was in. She couldn't see me, but she needed to feel the onions when I cut.

I heard the start of her new video, a small dog overcoming cancer. It was time.

I slithered along the floor, sneaking in behind her, holding myself just out of her vision but just within range of her nose. I rached into my satchel and produced the hefty and ripe green onion. My pearing knife held between my fingers, I waited for the right moment, and then sliced.

Aly felt emotions for the first time in months, and the apathy of 2021 began to fade away as the puppy walked for the first time in one of those adorable dog wheel chair things. She opened up the comment section and typed in:

*Damn Ninjas cutting onions*

SHIT. I'd been made!
