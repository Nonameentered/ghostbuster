"Oh God, wow that is a lot to take in," I started as the little girl in front of me froze with her mouth drooling open as she finished asking for a Pony the second she'd heard I could grant wishes. 

"Her will be done," the voice said, fading out on the tail end like it was going to go away.

"Wait wait wait," I said in the middle of the frozen park on a Sunny day, "how is time stopped is there's no magic?"

"What?" the voice asked.

"Well you stopped time-" I pointed out.

"Yes."

"But that's not magic?"

"I just pressed the button," the voice answered.

"There is a stop time button?" I protested.

"Yeah."

Oh. Well that answered that. "Is it a magic button?"

"Magic doesn't exist so, no."

"Is it your time stop button?" I asked.

"Yeah we all have one up here," the voice answered like that explained anything.

"All?"

"Lower-Upper Management."

"Oh okay," I put my hands in my pockets. "Neat." On a scale of wishes that might be able to get done during a time-stop scenario it was pretty easy. Harder than a soda but easier than 'get my parent's back together.'

"Are we done here Genie?"

"Actually if you have time...."

"Sure," the voice said, "I don't get paid by the call. What's the question."

"Well first, I have a name, it's Scott."

"Scott the Genie?" the voice asked.

"It was Scott the human but-" I- wait. How had I gotten to this point at all? If magic didn't exist how was I a genie? What had happened between Taylor's party and-

"You got hired," the voice cut in without letting my train of though tumble off that unfinished bridge.

"By who?"

"Upper management," the voice answered using the same tone it did when it made sense, which was infuriating.

"Why?"

"They probably liked your vibe."

"How?" 

"Without consent clearly."

"When?"

"Time is weird," the voice commented. Over the course of our conversation it had stopped booming so much, sounding more like the expected exasperated person on the other end, "Buttons stop it."

"Alrighty-" I said. For a moment I considered asking 'what' to complete the set, but the answer was 'to be a Genie,' and I was already out of order anyway.

"Good?" the voice asked.

"I think s-" I began and I could almost hear the person on the other of the call - was it a call?- reaching reaching for the 'end call' button.  "How do I fit in the lamp?"

"What?"

"How do I get in the lamp if there isn't magic. No phenomenal cosmic power, but-"

"We've all seen Alladin," they sighed, "you don't have a lamp."

"But I'm a genie."

"And nobody picks up lamps anymore outside of flea markets and Pinterest." 

"Fair," I admitted starting to walk over to a bench if I was going to continue this conversation, "but then what am I in?"

"A park."

"What am I summoned from then?" 

"A 64 Gigabyte iPhone 7 with a cracked screen. I think yours is Red."

"Why an iPhone?"

"More storage space than a lamp."

I clicked my tongue at that one as I sat down on a park bench beside someone who would never say hello. She was reading a text from a friend but it was too long with an amount of emojis I couldn't follow.  "Why an iPhone though?"

"I just-"

"Why now an android?"'

"I'm using a mac, guessing it's a brand deal thing."

"Woah," I answered. I had always been an android person which put me on the wrong team here. Would my phone even work when time was stopped? I mean I could see the emojis. How was I breathing if the air was frozen in place? Shouldn't-

"Are you done?"

"Is the time stop button Apple?"

"I don't think so but I'd need to ask someone and I am not pinging IT for that."

"Understandable," I nodded. "Look I know I have a lot of questions but I really feel like they're justified."

"All of this gets covered at orientation."

"I haven't don-"

"Yeah, you're supposed to come to the office after you complete you first wish, something that you're supposed to be WAY more Gung-ho about than this."

"Sorry," I answered, "I'm probably taking up way too much of your time-" I paused, "I didn't get your name."

"Cheryl."

"With a C?"

"You know a Cheryl with an S?"

"You would be the first," I admitted as I pulled the phone from the woman's hand and pressed the back button to see all of her unread messages. She was horrid at responding to her friends. "Scott with a C by the way."

"Yeah I figured," Cheryl answered, "Are. We. Done?"

"So I just go steal a pony?" I asked. 

"Sure."

"That's not magic."

"And magic isn't real," she pointed out, "if a horse popped in front of you it would seem like magic though, even if it was a stolen horse."

"Should I buy the pony?"

"The legality of the pony was not part of the wish."

"Can she care for it?"

"She didn't wish for a horse that she could specifically manage," Cheryl pointed out, "all you need to do is get her a pony. She didn't account for anything else, which means it's not your job."

"Is it-"

"There is no extra credit for making a better wish," she pointed out, "it's pass/fail. Get her a pony and I promise someone else will talk to you about how this all shakes down."

"Okay," I put the phone back in the woman-beside-me's hands as best I could and drummed my knees for a moment. All those legends about genies suddenly made sense, it was easier to make a shitty version of a wish come true than a perfect one. It wasn't malice, it was laziness. "I think I have it from here Cheryl."

"Thank Christ," she responded. 

"Wait is he real?" I asked, but there wasn't an answer. In fact, there was no noise. That was going to be a problem. Maybe this woman was carrying headphones. Honestly at the rate this 'time stop' thing was going I was willing to be soundwaves would work whether the air was frozen or not.
