178 Honeyborne had a history of being a curious house. Half the tenents had left in tragedy and bankruptcy, the other half has strode off as lottery winners or with some other form of miracle.

Of course, the most interesting thing about the house it in this economy was that it had a differnet person move in almost every year. Which likely made some real-estate agents extremely happy.

I hadn't bought 178 Honeyborne. My parents had, but they wouldn't be able to get to the new house for three weeks and they'd needed someone to move all the furniture in so Id been saddled with that job, along with house sitting.

Dad had called the house interesting which led to me figuring out the history of the barely twenty year old slice of surburbia. Afterall, what else was I going to do on my 'vacation' at my parents new place?

It had been determination to discover the mystery of the house that had led me to taking notes about anything out-of-the-ordinary that happened within the walls. The majority was innocuous, missing keys found in convinient places, tea boiling just when I went to check on it. Nothing supernatural as much as plesant.

The only thing that had really brought up questions was the master bedroom mirror. I'd gotten a scar at six by losing a headbutting contest with a table. A soft slash through my left eyebrow.

In the mirror I didn't have that scar. Pictures told me it hadn't mysteruously healed anywhere else.

Once I started questioning the mirror I wasn't sure if the discrepancies were me going insane or the mirror trying to tell me something. My teeth would be plaque free when I hadn't brushed yet that morning. My hair would part the wrong way until I corrected it. The bags under my eyes were worse on the other side.

All of it was innocious again, just enough to make me wonder if I was finding issues where there weren't any until I'd wore white and he wore black on the same day.

We stared at one another for a moment. Looking into the mirror as gears turned before I finally spoke first. "What the fuck."

The me on the other side of the mirror went wide eyed and then looked down at his shirt. "Shit I-" he looked at me again. "Okay this is earlier than usual but I guess I'm gonna just have to-"

"What the fuck," I repeated.

"I was gonna get to that." The mirror me put his hands in his pockets. "Jeez."

"What t-"

"Fuck," he finished for me, "okay if we're going to get anywhere I need you to stop saying that."

"W-" I stopped myself, "you're not a reflection."

"We're both reflections depending on which side you ask," the mirror shrugged, "am I allowed to say what's going on?"

"Why do you have this?" I asked while pointing to the scar on my eyebrow.

"How'd you get it?"

"I hit a table when I was a kid."

"I didn't do that," the mirror answered. Just when I opened my mouth to ask another question he raised a finger to shut me up. "Please I just wanna get through the expaination."

"I-uh," I shook my head to try to make all these imposisble thoughts align into something I'd accept. "Okay."

"Sweet. So uh-" despite his insistence that he should be the one speaking, he didn't seem to know exactly what he should say. "Have you heard about the whole gray portrait thing?"

"A portrait of Dorain Gray?" I prompted.

"Dorian," they corrected, "but yes. I'm like a mirror version of that. Not that I'm the opposite but that I'm.... I'm your reflection, you're a reflection, there is no painting involved."

"So you're going to absorb all my suffering?" I asked.

"Well you could take mine if you'd like, " they offered, "it's an option that a lot of people who were trying to be very nice took in the past."

"And-"

"Well I know you've been looking up the people who used to live in this house and-" the refelction shrugged again, "one side of this always gets a raw deal."

"Unless I don't choose?"

The other me bit his lip. "Yeah, but that never lasts."

"Why do I get to choose for you?"

"I'm on the wrong side of the mirror."

"Okay," I took a moment. This was all a lot to take in and admittedly I wasn't taking most of it home with me. Not freaking out meant not thinking about the horrificlaly broad implications of the whole thing.

The mirror waited as well.

"You're surprisngly okay with this."

"Nothing I can do about it," he pointed out, "either you end up on the wrong side of the trade or you don't. Just how it works. Plus, I know what's gonna happen."

"You know?" I asked.

"I'm you."

"Try me."

"If I was on that side of the mirror then I'd choose to do nothing because I think it's fair, but honestly as soon as things got bad. Whether Mom got cancer or I lost my job or-" he sighed.

"The mirror is right there in the bedroom to fix it." I finished for him and my relfection motioned to me to represent that I'd nailed. "Don't think I can resist?"

"Dude we can't stop getting a coke on the way home from work," he pointed out. "I love you- me- whatever. Will power ain't our strong point."

"Well-" I took a deep breath. It wasn't going to be fair if I made the choice to comdemn him. Life wasn't bad and no matter how bad it was I'd read the end of Dorian Gray. "Good news is that I don't need much, I'm not gonna be here after three days."

"No," the reflection took a deep breath, "but Mom and Dad are moving in, and you'll always  know I'm here."
