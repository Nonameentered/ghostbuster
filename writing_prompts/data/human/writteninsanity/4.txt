Vanessa's skin was the colour of the dress in Kimberly's hands, but it wasn't just a colour; the skin itself seemed almost like it was carved from grey marble, smooth but stone. Cracks filled with the warm orange of firelight traced their way along the skin that Kimberly could see. Two of those cracks ran up Vanessa's neck, up to her eyes which were empty save for that same firelight. 

"Holy fuck," was the first thing Kimberly said, which was fair. 

The light in Vanessa's eyes dimmed, and she inhaled sharply, putting a hand on her chest.

"No no, no," Kimberly let the dress fall to the ground to give the universal signal for 'back up a second,' "this-" she tried to find the look, "slays. It's just-"

"A lot?" Vanessa suggested. 

Kimberly nodded and took a step toward her roommate. 

"Yeah," Vanessa continued. She pulled the hand off her chest and pushed some of her black-as-evil hair behind her ear. It was shorter than her human hair, so it fit well. "It's been a while so-" she trialled off and took a deep breath, the fire glow rising and falling with it. "Do I look okay?"

"You?" Kimberly asked, taking a couple of steps back to get the full view, "or the dress?"

Vanessa pushed the rest of her body into the room and let her arms flop to her side. Were they slightly longer than they were when she was human, or was that just Kimberly's imagination? "Both." Vanessa settled on after a moment. 

"You're great. Love the hair."

"Thanks," Vanessa answered, breaking into a smile. The light came back to her eyes, literally. "Look," she said, and she shook her head. After a moment, she stopped, and her hair fell back to the exact position it had been in before she started. "It stays the same."

"Is that wh-"

"Yes, it is why I hate brushing," Vanessa confirmed. 

"Cool," Kimberly gave Vanessa the once-over again and tsk-tsked several times, "no on the dress."

"What?" Vanessa asked. 

"It's-" she tried to find the words for a moment and then just decided to ask, "should I call it your human form or?"

"Human form is right."

"And this is your demon form?"

"This is me; this is standard," Vanessa answered.

"Okay," Kimberly drummed on her thigh, "I think I like this dress on the human form, but not for demon you-" she looked over the whole package again, "are you sh-" she stopped herself, "is your human form taller than you?" was her correction.

Vanessa nodded. 

Kimberly nodded as well; that made sense. Vanessa was a cool 5'11 most of the time, so most people would be shorter. It might have been Kimberly's first comment if it hadn't been for granite skin and lights for eyes. A few inches was a lot of difference. 

"Wait-" she paused, "so you don't like the dress?"

"S'too long," Kimberly answered before bending down to pick up the dress she'd pulled out as Vanessa walked in. After she had it she held it up between her and Vanessa. Shit, it would have been weird to wear a dress that matched her skin, wouldn't it?

"Mother fu-" Vanessa started, "but it has pockets," she said before reaching into them and pulling out her phone. 

"Ohhh," Kimberly responded, which was the only appropriate response to learning that a dress had pockets.

Vanessa kept her eyes on the phone, went wide, then closed for a bit longer than a standard blink. 

"What?" Kimberly asked after a second, taking the time to put the dress on her bed properly instead of letting it drop the next time something dramatic happened. 

"Dad's not coming today," Vanessa said alongside a deep breath. 

"Oh, so we don't have to do the whole fianc-"

"He's coming tomorrow."

"Alright then."
