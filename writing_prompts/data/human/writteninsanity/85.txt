I woke up to the flashing red and blue lights through my eyelids. I groaned and pushed myself off the steering wheel, my shoulders and back screaming at me to stay down, keep resting. I'd been sitting for long enough now that my body wanted to slow down, and adrenaline took its tax eventually.

A young uniformed officer was getting out of their cruiser behind me and illuminating the back of my car with their flashlight. I waited for them to get all the way to the driver's side of my car before lowering the window and squinting at them as they pointed the flashlight directly into my face.

God, I was tired.

"You lost?" the Officer asked while taking a look around behind me in the car. At least he couldn't have seen the baseball bat I had in my trunk for the Josh battle.

"No, just I-"  I had been about to say that I lived down the street, but I wasn't sure that was completely true now. I lived there because my Mom and Dad let me, but if they didn't know who I was, then I did- I took a deep breath, "didn't wanna be too tired when I was driving."

"Mhm," the officer said and leaned in towards the window, almost getting into the car with me. "Looks like you've had the run of it."

"Bad day," I said, eyes dead straight instead of at the officer. I didn't need them to see the bloodshot eyes and assume that I was high or something.

"Where you are comin' from?" they asked.

"Bad day," I repeated. I didn't know what would happen if I said 'the Josh battle,' and I didn't have a better answer rattling around in my head.

"Yeah," they scanned me again with the flashlight, and I could feel the scowling, "I'm going to need more than that from you."

That was fair, considering I probably looked like I'd beat several men to death,  but honestly, I hadn't gotten in too many good shots before a Josh about twice my size had clocked me, and everything went fuzzy. "Uhh-" I started, but I wasn't the best at improv at the best of times.

"Look," the officer said, "I had someone call me about your car out here, but I don't wanna make your day any worse," they held out a waiting hand, "so let's just get some ID, and you can get the rest of your sleep outside the Walmart? It looks like you were on the receiving end anyway."

I took a deep breath and reached into my back pocket before giving the officer my entire, slightly damp wallet. I was out of energy and wasn't about to argue.

The officer frowned at unfolded my wallet, fishing my ID out and tossing the rest back to me. They looked over it and then furrowed their brow. "Son, you got a real ID in here anywhere?" The officer finished by pointing at my wallet.

"That's my-"

The officer cut me off by tossing my ID onto my lap. It was id for sure, but there was nothing where the name should be. What the hell?

"Could you please step out of the vehicle?" the officer asked.

"I-"

"Out of the car," the officer repeated.

"Uh-"

"Sir," the officer demanded.

I stepped out of the car and was immediately slammed back against it. "I-"

"I'm goin' to take you down to the station to get cleaned up," they said as they pressed my cracked ribs against the side of my dead friend's car, "and we can figure this all out." Nothing good was going to come from figuring this out. I either had no name at all, or something worse was going to happen to every Josh. I had no idea what was going on, but every part of me screamed that complying past this point wasn't smart.

I shot back an elbow at the officer was obviously wasn't expecting a fight, but I'd lived through several thousand Joshes, and I wasn't about to let a Steve or some bullshit take me down. The officer stumbled backward, and I broke out of his hold.

The officer went for his gun, and I lunged for the hand that he needed to do that. I got a hold of the hand first and pulled it away from his holster.  The officer threw his weight into me, trying to push me into the car, but I managed to get my other hand behind his head and drove him into the side panel of my friend's car.

The officer dropped and then groaned on the ground. Most people weren't hadn't faced life or death before, and it showed. He reached for his gun again, and I kicked his hand just to keep it off. I didn't want to hurt him; I just didn't wanna get taken by him.

I gave the officer one more kick in the wrist before pulling the driver's door back open and jumping into my friend's van. It hummed to life, and I slammed the gas, getting everything out of the ageing Crysler that I could.

The lights of the law faded behind me, and I gripped the wheels with white knuckles.

I didn't know where I was going because I didn't know where nobody was supposed to go.
