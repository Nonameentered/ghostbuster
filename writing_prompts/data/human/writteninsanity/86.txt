I'd been limping home for the past three days, nameless and bloodied from my time on the battlefield. I'd been one of the lucky few to avoid clashing with Little Josh near the end of the fight when he'd stopped playing nice.

The Josh that had driven me to the fight was dead, left dying on the Nebraska grass, but I'd managed to grab his keys from his bloodied pocket once night fell, and Little Josh had been coronated. I hadn't been the only Josh crawling away under the stars that night, but any other Josh I'd passed pretended to ignore me. Our feud was officially over, but that hadn't killed the resentment for some of them, so I wasn't about to risk interaction.

I'd managed to get myself home in my dead friend's van. Peeling off into the night as some of the Sworn, former Joshs that had pledged to maintain Little Josh's rule, chased the fleeing cars away from the battleground. Some of the other cars didn't make it out of the parking lots, but I had, and that was enough for me.

I shakily rested on the door before ringing the doorbell and leaving my bloody fingerprints smeared across the white. There was no answer, so I rang the bell again before struggling off the door and standing properly to greet my parents.  It was going to be wonderful to take a shower, wipe some of the blood off of myself and get back to my normal life. I'd taken my weekend to go and join a joke, but that had been the worst decision I'd ever made.

Mom opened the door and immediately dropped the mug she'd been carrying. Of course, she would, seeing her son torn up and bloody with half a shirt on. Then she'd slammed the door in my face.

"Mo-" I started just as she slammed the door. She must have been in shock. I tried the door to follow her, but she'd already managed to lock it. I was so fucking tired. It had been a long drive home and a longer time lying on the battlefield pretending to be another dead Josh among the rest. I managed to summon the strength to pound on the door again. "Mom," I cried weakly, "it's me."

The door half-cracked again a minute later. This time I caught my Dad's eye through the crack. "Dad," I squeaked, "thanks, I-" I went to get my hand in the crack of the door, and my father shoved it away.

"You stay away from our house," he spat, "you're bleeding on the steps."

"Wh-" I started, "Dad it's-"

"I don't know who the hell you are, but you're scaring my family," he said, "looks like you had the run of it, so I'm happy to let you drive away right now."

"D-"

"Don't make me come out there and force you," my Dad said from the other side of the door before slamming it again. I reached out to the door and then pulled my hand away before checking the address. That had definitely been my Mom and Dad, but maybe I was somehow at the wrong address. Or-

Of course, they didn't recognize me because I was covered in all of this bullshit. I just had to" I pulled out my phone and looked at the cracked screen that was half smeared with my blood. I had a few percent of battery left, so I dialled my home phone and waited.

"I told you to fucking leave," the door swung wide open behind me and slammed into my chest and stumbled back, heaving for breath as my Dad loomed over me, holding the handgun he'd bought for home safety years ago. His hands were shaking and twitching as he pointed at me. "I just want you gone."

"Dad, it's-" I started, but there wasn't any sign of recognition in his eyes. If it were the blood and dirt, I would have at least looked like someone he knew, and he would have been trying to figure that out, but that wasn't the case. I was a complete stranger to this man. His finger moved slowly to the trigger of the handgun, and I staggered to my feet. "Okay, okay, I'll leave," I said, backing away and trying to choke back tears. Maybe I was too tired to cry, or maybe I'd changed at some point during the Josh Battel Royale, but I knew I had to get myself away from danger before I could get traumatized.

I took the first several steps away from my Dad and the gun before turning and sprinting back to the Van. I smeared blood across the handle and then ripped the door open to throw myself onto the stained fabric seats. After one last look back at my Dad, who was still shakily pointing the pistol at me, I pulled out of the driveway and out into the cul-de-sac.

Once I was a street away, I finally fastened my seatbelt and pulled over to the side of the street. What had just happened? What was going on? How did my parents not even recognize me? Wha- I was dry heaving, my chest clenching like I should have been crying, but I was so out of water and will that I couldn't manage tears.

What had little Josh done?

I ended up falling asleep in that suburb, forehead resting against the steering wheel and scabs forming over my wounds from the battlefield. I didn't know what was going on, but I knew that I wasn't a Josh anymore now that a king had risen.

In fact, I didn't even know who I was anymore or if I was anyone.
