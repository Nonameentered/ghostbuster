There wasn't another solution to this, I was stuck, and I would go broke if I kept having to cook twice the food. Sure, I was starting a new job in two weeks, but I had to get there, and the Visa was nearly maxed. Plus, I'd just burned through the last of my rice, and what was I supposed to do? Not buy in bulk?

With my toothbrush tucked in my cheek, I stuck the paper onto the fridge using the fridge magnets Dad had brought me back from Cancun. It was simple enough, though I'd spent 2 hours trying to figure out the best way to say it.

*"House meeting at 11. You too, Ghost! >:("*

Was it the polite way to host a seance? Not quite, but I was past the point of doing things completely by the book. I'd blown a couple of hundred dollars trying to figure out this ghost's identity the proper way, but I was tired of sharing the bachelor, so if they took this as a sign of disrespect, I was fine with it.

I slipped back into the corner of the apartment I called my room and tossed my phone onto the bed before ducking into the bathroom to finish up brushing my teeth. That said, I took my sweet time getting to that part. I'd spent the last three nights mostly awake about the budget, and I was really starting to have bags under my eyes. Plus, my foundation was running low, so I couldn't afford to try to take them away. Everyone was going to have to know that I was tired, ghost included.

I took a deep breath and flicked the bathroom light off on my way out, taking the six steps it took to get back to my messy bed. I'd used to make it every day, but that was when I'd had work to get ready for. These days what was the point? I spent half my time on it watching videos on my phone either way.

It didn't take long for 11 am to roll around, and I sat up in my bed to stare over at the 'House Meeting' sign that I'd put on the fridge. It had definitely moved slightly, but I didn't know if that was my ghost of just shitty magnets.

Then the rarely used second chair at the table pulled out on its own. Well, it looks like they were on time, and I was late for the meeting now.

Well, I was twelve feet away, one of the few advantages of a bachelor.

I sat across from the roommate that I'd had for a while without actually speaking to them, and neither of us said anything. It wasn't like they could say anything, seeing as they were dead and I wasn't giving them a conduit to use, but it wasn't like I could afford one of those right now.

"Look, you need to go," I said, "I can't afford to feed you right now and-" the table shook for a moment and then the chair the ghost was using squeaked. "I get it," I raised both my hands in a 'this is my fault thing' "but I really can't afford to feed two right now."

The table shook again. "Oh, don't turn this into a haunting," I hissed. If I got this place fully haunted, it would ruin my safety deposit, and I wasn't having that. Maybe I couldn't speak to this ghost, but Jess' boyfriend could fill this place with enough Holy Light to send it to the after-after life.

The chair on the other side squeaked again, pushing away from the table and then the house meeting reminder I'd put on the fridge pulled itself off out from under the magnets and flew over to the table. It crinkled like it was getting poked.

"Oh my god, use your words," I sighed and pulled my phone out of my pocket, opened the text app and slid it on top of the paper that was getting *aggressively* poked. Instantly it started typing something.

That at least gave me some context on how old the ghost was. Older ghosts would have needed tech support for the next half hour or more.

After about half a minute, the phone spun around to face me and then edged itself along with the table until it was in front of me.

*Are you really breaking up with me during a house meeting?*

What the- I shook my head and tried to figure out something ELSE that the statement could mean. Did the- were you- "How would this be breaking up with you?" I asked, "it's not like we were-"

The phone darted back across the table before I could finish my sentence, so I guessed they wanted to refute my point. I leaned back in my chair with crossed arms and tapped my foot intentionally as I wanted for their response.

*I just thought we had a thing going because you kept making me dinner.*

"That was my dinner!"

*Wow, it really seemed like you were making enough for two the past few months.*

"I was! You kept eating half! You were stealing my phone. I wasn't dating yo-"

*Wait. What? Why do you think we were dating. That's weird?*

I gritted my teeth. "You just said that I was breaking up with you!"

*OUR PACT. GODS KELLY.*

I stared down at the phone and took a while to simmer about what they'd written. One of the biggest issues with having half the conversation be written was that I'd had a lot of time to be furious before they'd clarified. "What do you mean, our pact?"

*You summoned me in June. You kept asking to have someone keep you from eating all the Doritos, so...*

"Are you kidding me?" I asked.

*No.*

"Fuck me," I hissed under my breath before flopping down on the table. This is what I got for assuming the ghost was hostile or unknown. Of course, exorcisms didn't work. Their spirit was connected to me, so they were going to be warded by my magic and- "So you're my weight loss plan?" I asked.

There wasn't a reply except for the phone sliding the phone back across to me. That was a yes.

This was why New Years Resolutions sucked.
