Reignriver was a mistake of a town. We never should have built a place remote enough to see the will-o-wisps in the dark.

There was money to be made on the edge of the Mire. Silver veins surfaced with the moon and the brave could mine a living in just a few hours. We smelted the silver spoons of the noble and they paid in gold. Good reason to be here but for every soul in the city that wanted us in Reignriver, there was one among the Willows that wanted us gone.

It started with the kids. Always did. Youngins ran off in the night and Momma didn't notice until morning. We changed the bedtime stories, stopped talking about the bears back home and warned the little ones about the lights here. That'd worked for a while, but the lights got brighter and the trees started reaching down and snatching kids from their beds. Didn't take long for some of us to leave after that started. The brave ones barred their windows and headed to mine at midnight.

Months later mangrove roots started carving up the roads and basements. Broken streets cracked wagon wheels and fractured foundations let the water in. With the water came the lights. Can't have that.

Reignriver might be a cursed town, but we're smart. We pushed back the mangroves with fire and salt, cleansing the roads and burning down the forsaken homes. A lot of us lost everything, Only way to earn it back was by mining more of that moonsilver.

The Willows eventually tuned one of our own against us, but we didn't know who. We found folks down by the water, drained by leeches and missing eyes. We'd figured that it was Old Ms. Dempsy. Spinster turned sorceress is a tale as old as time. We gave her a fair trial before we burned her.

We also found more folks under the willows the morning after.

Some of us voted to leave, and some of us voted to stay, so we split in two. Most of the old blood headed back West to the big city with their tails between their legs, and they called us *young and dumb*. We wore that insult like a sheriff's badge and charged more for our silver.

The willows got brave after Reignriver split. Trees started looming over houses instead of staring at them. The bog rose so folks couldn't head home without getting their feet wet. We stopped counting how many people found the edge of the mire and just kept walking. Easier to keep our heads down and work.

Reignriver's a mistake of a town, but it ain't ours anymore, it's just mine.

Reckon I'm next.
