Blood for the old gods stopped flowing. Certainly, people still died in the age of enlightenment, but slim to none were killing in combat. Wars had been abolished, ideologies had compromised and nations were borderless. Organized combat, the thing that had sated the thirst of the Gods for generations, was a relic of the past.

For a while, random acts of violence and the good will of well-fed Gods had kept the mighty divine from enacting their wrath, but as the decades wore on, hunger set in. Gods had sent signs to the Earth, warnings of punishment to come, but they had been missed by us all.

Save for Eric, who'd just lost his scholarship for ranting about the Old Gods coming to Earth to consume thrice their price.

Again.

Eric stared down at his phone, screen cracked from a drop half a year ago. All he needed to do was press the button to call Mom and tell her that he'd  fucked up. The task was infuriatingly simple, but no matter how much he stared at the call button he couldn't convince his fingers to press it.

After much too long, Eric tucked his phone back into his pocket and waited on the bench closest to his bus stop. The rain should have bothered him, but it felt appropriate. Either he was right, the end of the world was coming, or he was wrong and the end of his world was coming.

Apocalyptic anyway.

Across the street, Miranda, a young poli-sci student from Eric's class got caught staring. She snapped her eyes away from the conspiracy theorist, tucked her books further under her arm and redoubled her pace.

Eric sighed. He'd been 'same class friends' with Miranda for the past two years and now she was scuttling past him. After two more deep breaths, Eric noticed that his laptop bag was getting hot. He pulled out his computer to put it properly to sleep.

The screen showed star charts, rearranged from their historical position to create gnashing teeth in the sky.  It had graphs categorizing the changed migration patters of dozens of animal species across the planet. Videos of the re-freezing of glaciers with no notable change in the global average temperature. Months and months of threads condensed into a single, arcane to understand presentation that he'd been trying to show to anyone who would listen.

At first, friends had listened, but then, like Miranda, they'd started giving him the same cautious look they gave a racist uncle on Thanksgiving.

Eric had thrown everything away at this point, of course, if it was right, he supposed it wouldn't matter. End of the world would make school an afterthought. It just still felt important right now.

Blood rained down from the sky and Eric scrambled to get his laptop out of the rain as it got harder. Once it was tucked safely in his bag, Eric had a moment to register the change. Eric's eyes went wide as he stared at the crimson droplets shattering on his hand. It was here, it was-

It was just rain. Eric shook his head. The ground wasn't stained red, and there was a normal crack of thunder in the distance. Nothing extreme, nothing strange.

Out of the corner of his eye, Eric caught a haggard looking woman staring at him from a dozen feet down the sidewalk. She looked from Eric, down to her hands, and then back to Eric. Her expression said one thing:

*You saw it too?*

Eric offered a slight nod as a response and then paused. He wasn't sure how to approach this. On one hand, someone who'd just seen blood rain would likely be more receptive to his star charts, on the other hand, she definitely fell under the 'look straight ahead and don't engage' category of stranger.

After a moment, she started walking just as Eric waved her over. The rain abated for a moment as she made her way over to him then flopped herself and her ragged torn coat onto the bench beside Eric.

"So-"

"You finally saw it," she said in a half-whisper, like she was trying to keep a secret from someone already out of earshot, "you saw the rain."

"Finally?" Eric asked.

"I've been seeing it for so long," the woman said, "they keep telling me that it's not happening but something-" she leaned much to close to Eric's face for anyone's comfort, "something is coming."

Eric recoiled from her sudden approach. On one hand, he'd finally found a sympathetic soul that might listen to everything he'd been tracking for the past months. On the other hand, was this how people saw him at this point? Did they think he was going to start talking about the hollow earth and how Mark Zuckerberg was a lizard person?

"I think so-" Eric said before pulling his laptop out as the woman used her coat as a pseudo umbrella. "-if you look here there is-"

Eric explained everything, getting soaked through in the meantime. All of his theories and all of the ways that the planet was preparing for something that people couldn't see. Or maybe they just couldn't  understand.

Just as Eric finished explaining the breath in causality that would lead to climate shifts, the rain turned to blood again, first a sprinkle, and then a downpour. Eric put his laptop away.

Unlike last time, the blood rain didn't stop, and this time the town started screaming.
