My Dad had been a small business owner, an entrepreneur, the kind of red-blooded member of the middle class who could have a beer with the boys after work and be accepted as a friend. He was the man who’d raised me.

When I was heading to University in 2010, he took three days off to drive me there himself. I’ll always remember what he told me, word for word. “You find the best people you can, you pay them well, you treat them right, and they become family. That’s how the little guys win.”

Cancer caught up with him during my second year when I was on academic probation. I’d flown home to be with him during his last few hours. They hadn’t been pretty, but the funeral had been gorgeous, with a thousand people who’d had their lives changed by my Dad showing up to say kind words and introduce themselves.

I dropped out of University to start running the family business, but it wasn’t a smooth transition. Luckily, Mallory had been there to show me the ropes and ensure that everything was running smoothly. Dad had really hired the best.

Every morning my desk was a pile of memos and success. The meetings I attended were short and to the point. Profits were on the rise, and it seemed like I barely needed to touch anything. Our business was a small happy humming machine.

Sandra from the security department had to go on maternity leave, and I personally found her replacement. A man I’d met at a bar back in Halifax. Fantastic man with a good head on his shoulders who’d been looking to get into police work. I had a good feeling about him, so I put him into the slot. After that hire, Mallory took some of my meetings off the schedule, and I was almost full-time focused on growing the little family my Dad had made.

I didn’t have a head for numbers or a love of lectures, but I could do people. I think I inherited my Dad’s sixth sense for it. Finding the right people was a hard job, but everyone I handed off to Mallory for an assignment was a smashing success.

Business boomed with the bigger team. Suddenly profits had more zeroes than I could count, so we hired more people, gave everyone raises, added more benefits to the package. Soon I didn’t even need to convince someone to join once I’d decided they were the right person; they heard the numbers and saw the pamphlet I’d made and signed in a heartbeat.

We ran a happy business, the kind that had lifetime employees. Happy people coming to work and doing what they did best because they wanted to. Every startup wanted to match our culture, and every big business was probably scratching their heads as to how we were doing so well.

I found the best people I could, paid them well, treated them right, and we were a family.

Eventually, we had a board of directors. Eccentric people looking to invest in our company. They wanted to make drastic changes, but I fought on every front for the little guy. Security guards were given hazard pay; I cut my bonus and gave it to the R&D team so they could take Christmas off to be with their kids; I wanted to make sure that I did everything my Dad would do.

But I never really knew what the scope of the business was until Glorybringer had crashed into my office on a Sunday afternoon, bloody and beaten. He limped up to my desk, and I stood up to meet him; after all, I was a big fan, and I needed to call the medical team on-site.

Mallory burst into the room, gun at the ready and aiming back at Glorybringer, and then she locked eyes with me and determination vanished into horror. She-

“Malloy,” I started.

“Sir, you weren’t suppo- It’s not what it-“

“You won’t get away with any more of this!” Glorybringer tried to will himself to take a swing at me but fell short. “All those banks, the weapons you’ve stolen, all of it. How do you live with-“ he trailed off, flopping down to the ground, clearly having lost too much blood.

“Mallory.”

“Jason.”

“Is what he- are,” my head whirred for a second, but the pieces didn’t quite fit. “Why were you fighting him?”

“Sir, you-“ she was struggling to tell me something, but I knew that we at least weren’t on the same side of the heroes.

“Mallory,”’ I started, “if you tell me what’s going on, will it change everything?”

“Yes,” she said.

“And if we let him go, it’s bad for us, isn’t it?”

“Everything’s over,” she clarified.

“Shit,” I sighed and flopped down into my chair. “We’re villains?”

“Yes.”

“What about all the stuff I see about employees? Is everyone happy?”

“What?”

“I asked.”

“Yes,” she said, “we’re all doing great but-“

“Then nobody needs to know,” I said, “do what you were going to do. Tell the board I am doubling the guard's hazard pay if they see a hero on their shift.”

“Wh-“ she started again before steeling herself. “Yes, sir.” Malloy rushed over to the limp body of Glorybringer and dragged in out into the hallway.

“You find the best people you can, you pay them well, you treat them right, and they become family,” I sighed towards the picture of my Mom and Dad on my desk. “I take care of my family.”
