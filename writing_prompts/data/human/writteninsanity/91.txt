I drummed my fingers on my coffin, which doubled as my desk. There were only five minutes left until the morning meeting. What was I going to say today? What was I going to tell them that would make them think that it was okay that I was missing the meet or showing up without my camera on for the tenth day in a row.

When this had all started, it had been easy. My personal computer didn't have a web-cam, and they were sold out everywhere, so I had a good excuse for why I couldn't appear on camera, but since I'd gotten my work computer, I was running out of options, and I was going to have a lot of explaining to do.

See, original cameras didn't show Vampires because they used mirrors, but for some damn reason, that quality extended to digital image capture. There was an explanation, something about the magic laws being partially powered by how people believed they would work, but the main point was that the post-COVID age had made it impossible to avoid being on camera.

Honestly, it wouldn't have been the end of the world if my coworkers know that I was a vampire. It wasn't like I was going to eat anyone any time soon, but I hadn't marked my condition down on my company-provided health insurance because vampirism raised your deductible. That meant that if my boss saw that I was a vampire, or it came up on any sort of paperwork, I'd have to pretend that the vampirism was recent. Even then, I'd be in trouble for not updating my information when I was diagnosed with the condition.

*\*Sorry everyone not feeling well, going to take the day... |\**

I abandoned the message in Slack's 'send' box with my cursor blinking at the end of it. This was our weekend shift. If I said I was sick, everyone was just going to think I was going to the cottage or had drank too much last night. Of course, I wasn't going to the cottage, I couldn't be out in the Sun anymore, but that wasn't something I could tell the group.

On the left side of my monitor, there was a small snake of sticky notes with excuses that I'd used over the last little bit scribbled across them. I could probably use the whole 'bad hair day' one again, but the issue was more that I hadn't been seen in a morning meeting when I'd had a webcam for three weeks. The reason mattered less now than the absence did.

I erased the message I'd pre-typed in Slack. Three minutes now, and I was also behind on my emails. There had to be something I could do. It wasn't even like I could use a filter because the camera didn't see me in the first place.

Wait.

*\*Guys, i have a really cool zoom filter I want to try.\**

I typed and sent the message and then doubled back to capitalize the I. People reacted with several of the custom workplace emojis we had, so I was in business.

Jessica posted the zoom link, and I took a deep breath before diving in. The computer asked for camera permission, and I said 'yes' and then grabbed my mug.

"Kyle!" Jessica exclaimed in that over-excited manager way, "you're finally on Camer-" she paused, "I don't see you. Can you hear me, Kyle?" she asked.

"Yeah," I said while trailing off before holding up the mug, "see how cool this filter is?!" I tried my best to sound amazed. On-screen, nothing was holding the mug; it was just floating there. "It makes me invisible!"

"How does that work?" Graham asked.

"No idea!" I answered. There was absolutely no way that something like that could work because it wouldn't be able to show my moving chair, but we were an eCommerce company, not a graphics company. Everyone likely fell into the category of 'I don't know enough about this to question it.'

"That's really cool, Kyle," Jessica said, "but let's not distract everyone, so filters off people, we have Toby-with-a-Y coming into our meeting today."

"Yeah, I'll get that working, just a sec I saved it-" I stared at my keyboard. Welp, now I needed to come up with an excuse for something else. "Just need to figure this out." I hovered my mouse over the 'leave meeting' button.

I pulled the trigger and sighed. I didn't have many more days of this.

*\*Zoom crashed. Back in a sec.\**
