Throughout his career, Shaw had mastered several skills. Not least of which was the ability to spot patterns. From the paths targets took through the city, to the movements of security teams, or even the number of rounds Black Diamond guards typically fired before reloading their standard-issue pistols.

Even now as he was behind the bar nestled between spirits and whisky he couldn’t stop his eyes from focusing on the patterns he saw in the world around him.

Not that this was a bad thing. In fact, this skill had served him well even as a bartender. Within three weeks he knew which drinks were the most popular, which meals were the most appetizing, and which patrons racked up the highest bills.

He could even accurately predict how much money he'd make in a given week or month based solely on the small clues he’d pick up on throughout the day.

But the pattern that interested him, or perhaps trouble him, the most was how similar his clientele seemed to be.

Mostly middle-aged men like himself with ragged features, rough hands, and eyes that darted quickly before freezing into thousand-yard stares that could last painfully long.

Everyone paid in cash and almost nobody ever sat at the small round tables that filled the middle of the room. Instead, the vast majority of his patrons opted to sit on the fringes. Favoring chairs that faced the door or had access to a quick exit.

With this in mind, Shaw had a few floor-to-ceiling mirrors installed on the far wall. That way the door could easily seen no matter where you sat.

In the agency, they called buildings like this Goldilocks zones. The perfect place to lay low without raising eyebrows or leaving yourself in a vulnerable position.

At the moment the bar was filled with an unusually diverse crowd. Four of his regulars sat in alternating chairs at the bar while two others sat at the red leather corner booth.

The rest of the seats were sparsely filled by drifters and first-timers. Some of which appeared to be tourists, no doubt trying to get out of the rain for a moment.

“Business is booming!” John Carter, one of the men sitting at the bar said.

“I liked it better when nobody knew about this place...” a man sitting beside him commented. Although this man was also a regular Shaw didn't know his name.

He came in a few times a week and as he put it, everybody just calls him Dutch. Whatever that means.

“That’s just how it works,” John said, “if it’s empty there's always a reason. Either the drinks are bad or the bartend can't stop talking.”

Dutch leaned over the bar and cupped his face in his hands—” If this keeps up you’ll have to start selling those pink girly drinks... what it called? Booba tea?”

John laughed while Shaw crack a slight smile “I’d love to see it! I can just imagine Shaw standing in the background of one of those Tik-Tac videos while a girl dances!”

Shaw was surprised to see the two laughing and talking together as much as they were. For the most part, everybody minds their business. Only ever asking for a refill or to have the channel changed.

But their conversation was quickly cut short when a young woman walked through the door. She had short straight brown hair that, despite the rain, was still perfectly arranged. Her medium-length grey tweed suit jacket draped over a neat white shirt which was tucked into a long skirt that matched the jacket.

She stood with impeccable posture yet carried herself with uncertainty as she stepped toward the bar. Shaw had seen dozens of young women just like her. Though admittedly he never expected one to come into his bar. Before she even reach the count He knew what she was.

An FBI agent.
