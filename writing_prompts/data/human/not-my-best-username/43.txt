“Two kids, a dog, and a golden retriever—final answer!” I said. It’s the only thing that makes sense for a house this big. Plenty of room, no muss no fuss!
  

  
My partner clearly didn't agree. She folded her armes and scrunched up her nose “Double or nothing!” —she laid a plate of bacon on the dining table—“Four kids, two dogs, and a cat!”
  

  
“You're actually insane!” I said leaning over my plate of waffles, “this is what; our fourth undercover job in suburbia, the third time we’ve gone with the whole husband and wife personas, and about the millionth time the agency paired us up! Name one time we’ve seen a family that big!”
  

  
“Fith!” She pouted. 
  

  
“What!?” I asked
  

  
“This is the fifth time we’ve been undercover in a suburban neighborhood!” —She pushed a lock  of luguroise brown out of the way, unlocking the full force of her baby blue eyes—“the first time as in Bel-“
  

  
“We don’t talk about Belgrade!” I interrupted, “That doesn’t count!”
  

  
She giggled to herself, “Oh, c’mon you're still sore about that!? I thought you looked… cute!”—She smiled warmly—“Look! Look! They're coming!” She raised her binoculars to observe the house across the street. 
  

  
A blue van rolled into the driveway and parked. This was the moment of truth. The sliding doors of the van sprung open and two little kids, a boy, and a girl jumped out, one leading a golden retriever on a leash.
  

  
“What did I say!” I cheered, reaching for the plate of bacon.
  

  
“Not so fast!” She slammed a hand on the table. “Keep watching!”
  

  
I watched in horror as the husband and wife stepped out of the van, and retrieved two toddlers out of their car seats in the back of the van.
  

  
“read’em and weep!” She said viciously. “Give me my money!”
  

  
Reluctantly I slid the plate of bacon across the table “Dude you're clearly hacking!” I complained, the head office was clearly leaking her information or something… you can’t be that attractive and smart…
  

  
She grinned widely as she chopped down on her ill-gotten gains. “You see, this is why I love working with you. Cute but dumb as rocks!” 
  

  
“Omg just kiss already!” A voice screeched through my earpiece. “I mean… operation housewarming is a go! Proceed with caution.”
  

  
“Shall we say hello to our new neighbors Mrs. Smith?” I asked.
  

  
“Of course Mr. Smith” she replied.
