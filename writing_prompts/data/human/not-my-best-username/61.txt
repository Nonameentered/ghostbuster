Fifteen years of blood sweat and tears lead to this moment. My armor glinted in the sun as I stood on a determined battlefield. With the shield, I’d forged out of the heart of a Great Colossus no blade arrow, or flaming missile would be able to scratch me. 
  

  
“Prepare to breathe your last Darkone!” I said, taking my battle stance. 
  

  
“Those are big words for such a small mortal!” The Dark Lord replied the long flowing black garb draping across her nearly seven-foot-tall body flapping  in the wind.
  

  
“Leave now and I shall forgive your trespass on my territory this one and allow you to die a natural death!”
  

  
“Your reign of terror stop this day!” I shouted beating my sword against my impenetrable shield. “No blade or arrow you can craft will be able to break through my shield. For it is no ordinary shield it is-”
  

  
“Forged from the heart of a Great Colossus” The dark lord interrupted taking a bit of the wind out of my prepared speech. “Yes, yes, I am aware of your little shield... all and all it is quite impressive.”
  

  
“Impressive!” I scoffed, “Do not mock me with your childish words! No blade or arrow can-”
  

  
“Peirce your shield...” She interrupted once again making my blood boil. “No, No, I get it, I do man... it’s truly impressive... I’m sure you worked really hard on it... it just...”
  

  
“Do you think your mind tricks will work on me she-demon?” I said, “There is nothing you can do to escape my shield and blade of justice!”
  

  
She sighed before reaching into the back of her waistband retrieving a strange metal object. 
  

  
“Wait for a second!” I shouted pointing with my sword towards what she held “is that a-”
  

  
“A highly modified Q-947 long-range double-barrel shotgun with a tactical 24 clip magazine...” She said, holding the overly engineered piece of America. “Yes. yes, it is.”
  

  
I couldn't say a word, it was like the breath had been taken out of me. 
  

  
“Now I’ll ask you again,” she continued now speaking in a southern dawn, “You wanna take you cute little shield there and get off my property before I pump you full of led?”
  

  
And that’s how I realized I wasn't the only off-worlder on this planet.
