The auditorium was filled with the cheers and applause of hundreds of audience members as I took a bow under the blinding stage light after another wildly successful show.
  

  
“Thank you, everybody!” I said waving to the crowd, “and good night!”
  

  
The music faded off as the two red stage curtains clapped closed together. 
  

  
The first time I got a standing ovation I wished it could have lasted forever. I must have slowed down that moment for hours repeating it over and over again before I was satisfied. 
  

  
Tonight though, I just wanted to get home, it had been a long and exhausting day. How many hours had I spent? Fifty-Seven? Sixty? 
  

  
I feel like I am always guessing nowadays. I’m not even sure why I wear this watch anymore. Its hands are never where they should be. 
  

  
I loosened my tie and swiped the sweat off my brow as I lifted my tophat off my head on my way to my dressing room. 
  

  
“Amazing show as always, boss!” Andrew the security guard said as he leaned on the hallway wall on the way to my room. 
  

  
“How many shows have you seen from back here now?” I asked.
  

  
“Over a dozen, I’d say,” he answered tugging at the brim of his blue baseball cap. “But every time, it feels like the first time you know?”
  

  
“Well, I’m glad you enjoyed it,” I smiled. Because I was glad it was finally over. 
  

  
No matter how many times he’s seen my show he always gives me the same look when I pass him backstage. That wide-eyed gleaming smile, that expression of absolute wonder and amazement you often see on children's faces but rarely see if ever on the faces of adults, seems to never leave his rosy face. 
  

  
“How could I not!” He asked, the excitement in his voice indicating what he thought.
  

  
 “You’re just—amazing! Amazingly amazing! I mean when you do that trick where all the cards stop in midair—like everything it just froze up there!”—he gestured grandly and seemed to get lost in thought—“And it’s different everything… I mean how do you even do it!?”
  

  
Before I could answer he apologetically raised both hands in defense. “I know, I know,” he said, “dumb question, ‘a magician never reveals his secrets’ right?”
  

  
“You got it, Andy!” I said with a smile. If I had a penny for every time someone had asked me that… well I guess I’d have a whole lot of pennies by now. 
  

  
I closed my eyes and slowed time to a stop. With time frozen I took the baseball cap off Andrew's head, replaced it with my top hat, and wore it. 
  

  
I blinked allowing time to resume. 
  

  
“Anyway, I’ll let you go now boss!” Andrew continued, “Oh before I forget“—his eyes lit up with shock—“Holy! When?”—he reached up and pulled the top hat off his head—“You’re amazing boss! Just amazing!”
  

  
I stepped past him as he held the top hat close to his face and examined it. He was so enthralled by looking for the “trick” in my ordinary hat he didn’t notice me as I closed the door to my dressing room, behind myself. 
  

  
Glad that’s over! I sighed. 
  

  
Maybe three shows in one day is a bit much.
  

  
I tossed the hat on the coat rack before collapsing into my favorite red leather couch that sat in the corner of my room beside a rack of show clothes. As soon as my head hit the armrest I started to drift off to sleep.
  

  
“Another Wonderful Show!” A strange whispering voice said.
  

  
I quickly sat up and looked around the room. It was empty…
  

  
“Hello?” I called out, “who’s there!”
  

  
“Don’t worry Mr. Harvey” the voice replied, “I wouldn’t dare sneak into a gentleman's dressing room without a formal invitation”
  

  
“But you have no problem bugging my room the liberty of patching yourself into my sound system do you?” I accused. 
  

  
“Forget it,” I thought to myself, “I’ll just reverse time and have Andy find the bug and remove it before the show”
  

  
“I wouldn’t do that if I were you!” The voice cautioned. 
  

  
I snapped to my feet and looked around the room. “How did you? Where” — I reversed time and tried out a few dozen different variations of the conversation. 
  

  
No matter how loudly or quietly I’d say something,  even if I only said it in my mind the voice would reply. 
  

  
“You’re some kinda mind reader? Aren’t you” I said.
  

  
“Very good!” The voice replied with a patronizing tone, “how many times have we had this conversation now? Six? seven?”
  

  
“What’s your game here?” I asked,  “You gonna rat me out to the feds so they can slice  me open and run their little experiments on my abilities?”
  

  
“Where would the fun in that be?” The voice asked, “I just need your help with a little project of mine”
  

  

  
“And why should I help you?” I said.
  

  
“Well, that’s simple!” The voice replied, “I know about your little secret and if you refuse to help me a whole lot of other people will know it too!”
  

  
“Counteroffer, I track you down, reverse time, and make it so that you and I never cross paths? Or maybe I’ll just kill you?”
  

  
“What a barbaric thought!” The voice replied, “That's not a very gentlemanly thing to do plus that wouldn’t work!”
  

  
“You see, I’ve known your secret for quite some time now,”
  

  
“So what!?“ I replied, “I’ve trained my power every day, using it in shows three times a day, I can go back as far as I’d like.”
  

  
“That makes two of us,” the voice replied, “I might not have your special ability but I too can travel in time, I can force my conscience into my younger self.”
  

  
“And I suspect just as you do that you cannot go back to before you were born!”, The voice chuckled, “and good thing for me, I was born before you!”
  

  
“So we’re at a stalemate are we?” I conceded.
  

  
“That would seem to be the case”
