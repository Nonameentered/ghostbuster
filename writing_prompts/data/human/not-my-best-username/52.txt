Part 3

I threw myself to the ground quickly ducking behind the wall the professor's gaze darted in our direction. 
  

  
“Shoot!” I swore under my breath, “Hope he didn't see us!” 
  

  
“DON’T MOVE!” He said in a hushed whisper, sitting next to me with his back against the concrete wall.
  

  
“Why not!?” I asked quietly. “Can he see through walls!?” 
  

  
“I dunno maybe!?” He said panicked, “But, If you don’t move they can't see you! Everybody knows that!” he said closing his eyes and curling into a ball with his knees up to his chest.
  
 
  
“What are you on about!?” is he some kinda dinosaur! Now?” I asked
  

  
I heard my breath as the gentle jingling sound of keys drifters through the air. Professor Newmen reached into his jacket pocket and retrieved a keyring that he used to open the door. 
  

  
A second late he stepped through the door, being sure to closed tightly behind him. 
  

  
I waited for a few moments to be bure sure he was gone before bounding over the wall and landing like a superhero on the other side in front of the door. 
  

  
“What are you doing!? You can't go in there!” he said with panic in his voice. “He'll see you!” 
  

  
“Don’t worry about me Demon Slayer, I can take care of myself” I replied reaching for the door. 
  

  
I pulled down on the handle but it wouldn't budge.
  

  
“See, locked!” he said, “That professor never forgets to lock the doors. It’s part of his pattern!”
  

  
“You seem to know a whole heck of a lot about this school for some a kid that doesn’t go here!” I pointed out before reaching into my black backpack to retrieve just the tool for the job. 
  

  
“Well... that’s not entirely true!” he said as he climbed over the wall joining me in front of the door. 
  

  
“I do attendant his school. I just... do my best to stay out of the public eye.”—He was standing behind me so I didn't see it but I just knew he was posing again— “I’m that thing you see, just for a second, in the corner of your eyes, I lurk in the shadows—  —I AM THE SHADOWS!”
  

  
“I get it,” I said.
  

  
\-the first pin locked into place, 
  

  
“You're a loner.” 
  

  
\-the second and third pins clicked in. 
  

  
“No big deal...”—He polished his nails—“I do my work in solidarity. Nothing to distract me from my research and training you know!?” 
  

  
\-The fourth pin locked in.
  

  
“Well... You enjoy your solidary research training thing... I’m gonna have a look around inside!” I said as the lock turned and the door opened. 
  

  
They really need to update these locks...
  

  
“What!? You gotta take me with you!” He said, “I’m always outside, I’ve never been able to observe close up, from the inside!”
  

  
“I mean every single time I set up cameras some moron would just takes them down! That darn janitor is always getting in my way. I mean... there's only so much you can learn by going through the trash!”
  

  
“Cameras... trash? Not even gonna ask,” I said under my breath. I put my lockpick back in my bag and looked at him. 
  

  
Nope! Not happening! you said it yourself It’s better to work alone! Plus, how am I supposed to trust someone if I don't even know their name!? And no! I’m not calling you Doom Player95 or whatever you go by!”
  

  
“Oh, please!” he begged, “I’ll never ask you for anything ever again! You wanna know about that professor guy right!? I’ve been watching him for months. I have a tone of info!!”
  

  
I didn't say a word I just kept staring at him. 
  

  
He clenched his fist and shook his arms “Fine! My name’s... weenhujr” he mumbled under his breath.
  

  
“What was that I didn’t hear you,” I said opening the door a bit wider. “Alright... I’m going in alon-”
  

  
“My name is... WEENIE HUT JR!” he said more loudly.
  

  
I laughed, “Lemme guess, your dad is Weenie Hut Sr. right?” 
  

  
“Yeah,” He said sighing and dropping his head.  
  

  
His cheeks were flushed his face contorted as stared wide-eyed  at the sidewalk. He wasn't kidding...
  

  
Some sick twisted psycho had actually called the child Weenie Hut Jr...Maybe Doom Slayer679 wasn't so bad after all.... 
  

  
“Fine! Fine Alright you win” I agreed. “You can come with. But! I’m not calling you. Let’s just  stick with Doom for now Deal?”
  

  
“Deal!” he said taking my hand and shaking it like it owed him money, “You're a legend! But-what should I call you!?”
  

  
You can call me Liv.” I said, “Liv Hughes.”
