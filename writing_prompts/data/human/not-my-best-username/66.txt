Frostbites personal henchmen for a whole week!? Duke thought to himself. There was no telling how much he could learn from an experience like that!
  

  
Dukes mind began to salivate at the possibilities, If he could only win this prize he told himself, Not only would he learn in’s and outs of being a henchmen, he’d also get to see all the build up, all the work done behind the scenes by a super villainess like Frostbite who is so good at covering her tracks.
  

  
Not only would it make him a better hero, he reasoned, it would also put him one step ahead of one of the most notorious villains this city has ever seen!
  

  
His mind was snapped back to reality as the crowd contracted around him, each man, woman, and child desperate to be at the front of the line, to been seen and noticed by Lady Frostbite.
  

  
“Pick me!” A man shouted, causing duke ears to ring, “I swear I’ll be the best henchmen you’ve ever had! JUST GIVE ME A CHANCE!”
  

  
“SIGN MY BABY!” A woman's voice shrilled! 
  

  
“I’d die to be your henchmen for just one day!” And another voice cried out.
  

  
“Silence!” Frostbite demanded in a cold tone. 
  

  
In a flash Frostbite reached out her hand and used her powers to condense and freeze the water particles in the air creating a massive ice-wall in front of the crowd which she used to push the crowd away from the stage at speed! 
  

  
Duke's reflexes were the only ones fast enough to allow him to front flip over the frozen wall and land untouched on the other side!
  

  
After landing, Duke instinctively reached for his utility belt, forgetting in the heat of the moment, that he wasn’t wearing his suit. Looking over his shoulder he could see the clambering mob he was just a part of safely tucked away behind the ice barrier like the audience at a rock concert. 
  

  
Duke suddenly felt as if his secret had been exposed, as if this had been a test and he just failed. The bead of sweat forming on his forehead froze solid as Frostbite pointed to him. 
  

  
“This one will do nicely.” Frostbite said, staring down at him with cold blue eyes. 
  

  
Duke was flooded with a rush of mixed emotions, excitement, fear, happiness, he tried his best to stop his face from revealing his inner turmoil but he was clearly stunned the only thing he could manage to say was a curt “cool.”
  

  
Which made him look all the more calm and collected. 
  

  
Frostbite broke down the ice wall dispersing the ice particles back into air, allowing the crowd to approached the stage once again. 
  

  
From the grumbles of the crowd Duke could tell that half wanted to strangle him, a quarter wanted to stab him, and the rest wanted to dance on his grave for taking their opportunity.
  

  
It made him regret not wearing more armor under his disguise.
  

  
But Duke couldn’t help but be surprised by the amount of honor and sportsmanship  he witnessed among these criminals. 
  

  
Duke had won fair and square, and though they didn’t like it, the henchmen in training congratulated him on his win as as they took their positions back in front of the stage. 
  

  
It made him remember that time a number of hero’s had gotten into a huge argument about who should get the credit after they’d all worked together to save the day. He thought it strange how much better a group of thugs had taken it then the so-called defenders of the justice. 
  

  
The crowd suited down as Frostbite spoke about the need for a healthy work life balance. 
  

  
“Where things fall apart,” She said, “is when people make mistakes. People make mistakes when their tired, distracted, or not feeling well.”
  

  
“Nobody wants to lose out on a million dollar windfall because one henchmen out of twenty came to work with a cold, or slipped up in an interrogation because they have slept properly in a week.”
  

  
“If you want your crew to take care of you, you first must take care of yourself!”
  

  
Duke found himself hanging on Frostbites every word. It was true what she said, even for heroes! He’d seen too many themselves at the work with so little regard for themselves that they disinterested into oblivion, some even becoming villains. 
  

  
Duke was guilty of pushing to far himself! And “when was the last time you took a mental health day!?” 
  

  
Not even his civilian job cared as much as Frostbite does about her employees!
  
It made him question what Captain Criticals words really meant. What does it mean to be a Villain?
