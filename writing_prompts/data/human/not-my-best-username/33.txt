Dough. Sauce. Cheese. Pepperoni. Long ago the four ingredients lived together in harmony. Then everything changed The Huts attacked.
  

  
I was just a boy when it all started. I used to ride my moped from place to place. Not a care in the world with  A Hot’n Ready strapped to my back and the symbol of my people embroidered on my shoulder. 
  

  
I still remember the day I walked into my first Dimino’s. I had nothing. No job, no friends, no family. But the Domino’s have given me all of that and more. But... It didn’t make what I had to do next any easier. 
  

  
I walked into the back room, staining the souls of my boots in the hot red mess that was pooled on the tile floor.  
  

  
“This would be a lot easier if you just talked!” I said to the man that lay on the floor.
  

  
He was just a kid. Maybe 18 or 19 years old. His white shirt was stained and frayed and there was a massive gusher where the Hut Logo used to be on his uniform. 
  

  
Despite his age, he stared at me with the eyes of a soldier. 
  

  
“I’m not saying a thing!” He said before spiting a hot red gob onto my boots. 
  

  
“You shouldn't have done that!” Josh, one of my co-workers said, has he walked up and stood beside me. “Nobody get's to just spit out our marinara sauce! It’s a Domino FAMILY RECIPE!” 
  

  
Josh lunged forward like he was about to strangle the kid but I help him back by the collar of his shirt!
  

  
“He’s not worth it!” I said, trying my best to contain my own rage! “Our sauce is too good for the like of him anyway!” —I knelt down and looked the battered boy in the eye—” If you’re not gonna eat, you’re gonna talk!”
  

  
“I’m not saying anything to you freaks!” the boy shouted. His voice cracked due to the stress.  
  

  
“We have ways of making you talk!” Josh said.
  

  
“I'm not scared of you!” the boy shouted, “There's nothing you can do to me that will make me talk!”
  

  
“Oh, we’re not gonna do anything to you!” I explained. “That would be bar barbaric”
  

  
I slipped on a pair of latex-gloved and gave Josh and gave him the nod. We’d done this so many times he already knew what to do. 
  
Josh reached into the fridge and retrieved a Hut pizza that we had captured the day before. With a gloved hand, I reached into the forbidden drawn, retrieving a case of one of our most dangerous weapons. 
  

  
Josh placed the pizza box right in front of the boy and opened it. Then slowly but surely I began to slowly lower a piece of pineapple onto the pizza.
  

  
“No!” The boy shouted in disgust. “You wouldn’t dare!”
  

  
“This could all end if you just tell us what you know!” I shouted as my pineapple-filled hand inched closer to the cheese crust. 
  

  
“You-you're all monsters!” the boy shouted as he tried to look away from the horrific scene.
  

  
Josh grabbed him by the top of the head and forced him to watch as I lowered the pineapple slice even closer to the pizza.
  

  
“Is this what you want to see!” Josh shouted, “Just tell us what we want to know and this can all be over! WHERE IS THE OREGANO!”
