Exhausted, Dax pushed his way through the crowded bar. Nearly crashing into unusually large Larbeck who in a stupor swayed forward as he struggled to stand steading himself with his third arm on the corner of the table. 
  

  
Hauz the Zormoian bartender and proprietor of the establishment watched him walk in and immediately prepared his usual drink.
  

  
Dax didn’t know why the four eyes giant was always so nice to him. Maybe it was his magnetic personality or quick wit or maybe it was because Dax was the only human he’d seen in this corner of the galaxy in quite some time and just liked to see a genuine human's reaction to classic Zormoian cocktails. Either way, they had a deal. Dax could drink as much as he liked as long as he didn't ask what he was drinking. 
  

  
“Long Day?” Huaz asked, his gargling bassy voice resonating just loudly enough to be heard over the clattering patrons. 
  

  
Dax took his seat on his usual stool near the far corner of the bar resting an elbow on the bar top.
  

  
“Isn't every day long?” Dex asked rubbing his bloodshot eyes. 
  

  
A moment later Huaz placed a huge pitcher of ale on the bar and slid it into Dax’s waiting hand. 
  

  
The two chatted for a few minutes, talking about the result of the latest Blebeck game as Dax downed another cocktail of Huaz’s creation. 
  

  
A slender Dorian women with dark purple hair took a seat on the open stool beside Dax and quickly struck up a conversation. 
  

  
“Good to see  a fresh face around here!” She commented before ordering a drink in her native dialect. “I didn’t think Andorians traveled this for into the outer reaches.”
  

  
“They don’t!” Dax said as he took another sip of his drink not really in the mood for small talk with a stranger.
  

  
“This one’s human!” Huaz said with a note of pride in his voice.
  

  
 “Oh!” She said leaning forward to get a better look at him. “you’re from Earth right!?” —Her long tendril-like hair twisted with excitement— “I love that place! Baseball, Iced-cream, those funny little... What do you call them—dorgs! So sad when it was all destroyed.”
  

  
Dax was only half listening as she spoke. More than that she had a heavy accent and Galactic common needed some work. 
  

  
“Yeah, it’s got really good…. wait, what?” Dax said. “What do you mean destroyed!?” he pushed to his feet almost knocking the stool to the ground.
  

  
“Oh,  you haven't heard?” The Dorian asked. “I didn't mean to. It’s just— The Federation announced earths disappearance some time ago!”
  

  
Dax sat back in his chair and absorbed this newfound information for a second.
