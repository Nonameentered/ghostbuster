I took my notes as I usually did. Nobody ever told me death came with so much paperwork...
  

  
The frail man lay face down in his bed, his phone screen still lit after a failed attempt to call an ambulance. I shifted through the space, floating above the cluttered dirty clothes and unwashed sheets that made me grateful I lacked the ability to smell. 
  

  
But as I examined the body, something shifted behind me. I could sense it. The presence. The same presence that I had noticed the last few times I’d collected a soul.
  

  
“Come on out here.” I said half joking, “I don’t have many fans so I’d love to finally meet you!”
  

  
To my surprise, a small figure shifted in the half-open closet and stepped out from the shadows like something out of an old horror flick. It was a young girl, maybe thirteen years old, with long dark hair, pale skin, and big soulless eyes. 
  

  
“I’m not a fan.” She spoke after studying me for a few seconds. “At least not lately...” she continued as she looked around the room.
  

  
“Oh and why is that?” I studied her with fascination. How could she hear me?
  
 How could she see me?
  

  
“Because you’ve been getting sloppy lately.”—She Wagged a finger at me —“That woman with the green eyes and the cats. She died of tachycardic arrhythmia at 14:12 on her thirty seventh birthday.”
  

  
“I see you’ve been paying attention,” I said.
  

  
“I see that you haven't!”—She stepped forward and looked up at me with fire in her eyes—“If you had been paying attention you’d know that she died twenty three minutes behind schedule.”
  

  
“And what do you know about the schedule?” I asked, “Death waits for no man or woman. Death is always on time.”
  

  
“No, but it will be...” she said shaking her head.
  

  
“Oh, and how do you know that? Who are you?”
  

  
“Your replacement.”

And just like that she vanished again. The first person I'd spoken to in hundreds of years.
