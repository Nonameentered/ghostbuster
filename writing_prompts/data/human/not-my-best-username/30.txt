**STAY INSIDE.**

My head spun as I sat on the edge of the bed trying to remember another in the list of odd dreams I’ve been having almost every night.

Blurry images and muffled voices shouting cryptic messages were the only things swirling inside my head. But there was no time to doddle.

I pressed off the bed and began my morning ritual. My apartment is so small I can easily cook breakfast, shower, and listen to the morning news without missing a word.

**STAY INSIDE.**

“STAY in the shade and **STAY** hydrated, it’s gonna be a hot one!” The news reporter said, “Health officials are warning of records heats in Clayton county. For your own safety, it is highly recommended to **STAY INSIDE** and out of the heat!”

The television hissed and buzzed as the antenna lost single for a few seconds.

I should really replace that old thing. I told myself before taking the final few bites of my breakfast and cleaning the dishes.

I checked my watch and it was 7:45, time to head out.

I grabbed my car keys and headed for the door but just as I reached the threshold I remembered something. The window was open. I crossed the apartment and pulled down on the Craftsmen-style window.

But to my surprise, there was something written on the window when it closed. A message painted in bold red letters.

“**STAY INSIDE. OUTSIDE IS NOT SAFE OUTSIDE**”

What in the world? I thought. How did someone manage to paint something on a fifth-story window?

I reached out and placed two fingers on the glass. Strangely the paint was on my side of the glass. I instantly pull my hand away and red paint began to drip down from my fingers and onto the floor.

Did someone get in here? How did they...

I looked back down at my hand and the paint was gone. My hands were clean and... “You get that report done Bruce?” A voice behind me called out.

I quickly spun around to see Bryce Halliday, my manager standing beside the water cooler.

“How did I... when did you...” I stuttered as I tried to understand what had just happened.

“You doing okay slick?” Halliday asked placing a hand on my shoulder. “You’ve looked distracted all day!”

“Sorry, sir!” I said shaking my head. “Guess I’m a little out of it. Must not have slept well last night.”

Halliday smiled and tilted his head, “Don’t you worry son, It’s almost quitting time and it’s a Friday. Why don’t you head home early and **STAY INSIDE** for a little? Just until you feel better!”

I took a step back and pushed his hand away. “Why does everyone keep saying that!?” I shouted, I looked around the room remembering that I had never worked in an office before. I never had such a normal life before.

This isn’t right!

I dashed out of the office and into the hallway pushing past a group of men and business suits and sending the stacks of paper they were holding scatting into the air.

But as I raced down the hallway I seemed to make no progress. The corridor seemed to stretch endlessly into the distance. Row and rows of identical doors flew by as white blurs in my peripheral vision.

At random, I picked a door and opened it. The room was entirely empty four plain white was with a message inscribed on them written in big red lettering.

**STAY INSIDE.**
