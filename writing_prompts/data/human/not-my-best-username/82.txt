\-—BREAKING NEWS—-
  
“The trial of the century involving the bond friendship that goes back as far as to the stone ages is now underway, leaving many legal experts to speculate about just what it truly means to be man’s best friend!” The news anchor said welcoming the audience back to the program. 
  

  
“That's right Lucy!” Another sharply dressed news anchor said, “The first-ever interspecies trial is underway pitting dude against dog and man against man’s best friend!”
  

  
“And now without further to do, we bring you to live into the courtroom!”
  

  
The courthouse was filled with an unusual energy, a feeling of excitement mixed with a strange reverence and an uneasy anticipation. 
  

  
The honorable Judge Matthew Couthwell, sat comfortably in his raised chair presiding over the packed court of law with dignity and splendor. 
  

  
Sitting in the witness chair was the defendant Doug Brewster, who squirmed and twisted in his seat before adjusting the small mic for the fifth time in a row.
  

  
across from him perched on a chair behind the prosecution's desk was Rover, a 5-year-old Labrador-mix who wearing a doggy suit and a translation collar and who also happened to be the pet of the defendant. 
  

  
Standing between the two was Alan Crain, a lawyer with quite the reputation in and out of the courthouse and the prosecutor of the case. 
  

  
Alan rubbed his hands together and straightened his tie before directing the jury's attention to the large screen mounted in view of the jury box. 
  

  
“The prosecution presents into evidence exhibit 02.58B,” Alan said waving with a hand to the screen. “Mr. Brewster, would you please describe to the jury what is shown in this Image?”
  

  
“Well!” Doug said, clearing his voice, “ that my — I mean — Our treat jar! I keep it on the counter right by the fridge.”
  

  
“I see!” Allan said nodding, “And, based upon this picture how full or empty would you estimate that jar to be?”
  

  
“Well… I’d say it’s almost entirely full” Doug answered. 
  

  
“Almost entirely full! That's interesting!” Allan said with a smile, “When was the last time you filled that jar?”
  

  
“Well… I  don’t really know… maybe a week or so…” Doug said sheepishly. 
  

  
“At this time the prosecution is entering into evidence exhibit 05.032. Namely a digital receipt for the purchase of one  ‘‘32-OZ Happy Healthy Peanut Butter Dog Treat’”
  

  
The judge nodded as Alan handed Doug a printed copy of a receipt that simultaneously appeared on the screen.
  

  
“Would you please read the date circled in red on this receipt?” Alan asked. 
  

  
“It says December 6th 2021.” Doug read,
  

  
“Isn’t it true,”—pointing a finger at the screen— “that you last filled that jar on December 6 2021 over 4 months ago?!” 
  

  
“Well.. I suppose that’s right” Doug Admitted.
  

  
“Is it your sworn testimony that In all this time, over these past four months My client, Mr. Rover, has done nothing, nothing at all to deserve a single treat!” Alan asked, pounding on the witness stand. 
  

  
Doug shook his head, unable to bring himself to answer. 
  

  
“We’re waiting Mr. Brewster!” Alan demanded, “Do you expect us to wait four months like Rover just to get an answer!?”
  

  
“I wouldn’t say that Rover’s done nothing… it just”
  

  
“You’re right you wouldn’t say that!” Alan interrupted, “Just seven days ago you posted this Image” —A picture of Doug and Rover posing together appeared on screen—“with the caption just me and my Verified Good Boy hanging out! #MansBFF, #GoodBoy, #LittleCreekDogPark”
  

  
“Objection!” Harry Kittinger, the defense lawyer, interjected, “he’s badgering the witness!”
  

  
“Sustained!” The judge ruled, slamming his gavel down. “Mr. Crain, you will allow the defendant enough time to answer the question!”
  

  
“I Understand your honor!” Alan said, gesturing grandly before razing an eyebrow, “ ordinarily I’d let the sleeping dog lie but in this case, I realize that time of the essence!”
  

  
The judge scoffed before prompting Doug to answer the question.
  

  

  
Clearly shaken, Doug shifted in his seat before speaking, “W-Well… like I was saying, I wouldn’t say that Rover hasn’t done anything good. it's just that… it's easy to forget you know. 
  

  
Alan looked at the jury and shook his head, “The prosecution has no further questions for the defendant at this time!”
  

  
“Very well!” The judge said, scanning the room with his eyes. “Does the defense wish to cross-examine the witness?” 
  

  
Doug and his lawyer made eye contact as he slowly stepped down from the witness stand and made his way back to his seat. 
  

  
“Not at this time your honor,” Harry said with a note of frustration in his voice.
  

  
“Very well,” the judge nodded, \`\`Prosecution, call your next witness.
  

  
“The prosecution calls Rovers to the stand!” Alan said.
  

  
There was a barely audible coo from the jury stand as the well-dressed golden retriever hopped down from the chair and made his way to the witness stand. 
  

  
After situating himself, Rover pushed the mic into the proper position with his nose and waited to be asked a question. 
  

  
Alan stood between the jury and Rover being sure they had enough time to see how cute and adorable the golden retriever was before asking his next question. 
  

  
“How long have you and Mr. Brewster known each other?” Alanskesd with a sweater tone then he used with his previous questions. 
  

  
Rover’s collar glowed a bright blue as the device translated his thoughts into spoken word—”35 years” He said.
  

  
“Objection!” Herry interjected, “Facts not in evidence! The dog- I mean, Mr. rover is only 5 years old. How could they have known each other for over 30 years!?”
  

  
Alan tried his best to keep the smug grin off his face after the defense had so easily fallen into one of his traps.
