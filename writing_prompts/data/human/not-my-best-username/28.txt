A piercing steering pain racked his skull as the young man stumbled through the darkness, choosing to grope around and feel his way around the corner instead of risking exasperating his condition by turning on a light.

As his flat footed steps thudded on the hallways wooden floor a sharper cleaner sound rang in his ears. It sounded like two glasses or mason jars clanging together or bounced off on another.

The sound was loud enough to hear but not loud enough to tell where it was coming from.

Ducking his head so as to conceal himself as he entered the kitchen through the narrow archway he crept forward stepping silently on the tile floor.

A great murky looming figure stood in the center of the kitchen illuminated on one side by the flickering light of the open refrigerator as it flickered on and off and shrouded on its other side in total darkness.

The towering mass of blackened flesh and sinew seemed to make everything around it darker. Like it’s sprawling tentacles we’re eating the light out of the air.   


For a brief moment the refrigerator lights shinned so brightly the young man could see the details of the abomination that stood before him but his mind could not comprehend what he saw.

He tried to draw it, explain to a friend what it was… what he had seen. but even as his hand wrote these words…
