Time, not to be confused with its glorious herbal counterpart Thyme has long been hailed as the oldest thing in existence. But that couldn’t be further from the truth. 
  

  
In reality, something far more precious was there at the beginning. You see before the universe we know today existed food was there. Before the earth began to spin on its axis, A simple cocktail of gasses and matter floated together in a void before it was set aflame by the infamous “big bang” scientists can't stop talking about.
  

  
You see, the truth is that food is everything. Food is LIFE— Food is DEATH— FOOD IS YOU AND ME! Many are blinded to the reality that hides in plain sight. The universe is a comic oven and we are the raw ingredients. My life goal is to prove this truth. 
  

  
My journey began some nine months ago when I learned of an ancient parchment that was being sold at an auction in the south of France. 
  

  
According to a reliable source, this parchment was discovered deepest chamber of a Maine temple by an archeologist by the name of Indi Anna Jones. 
  

  
Ordinarily, such a discovery wouldn’t interest me in the slightest. But this parchment wasn't just some old manuscript. It was special.
  

  
The parchment contained a list of instructions, a recipe if you would, the oldest surviving recipe in recorded history. One that had fought the battering sands of time and won! 
  

  
And if reports about this parchment contained were true this recipe detailed the creation of time-altering delight—a fortune cookie! 
  

  
After investing what amounted to be a small fortune in the translation of this ancient text.
  
I had a list of rare ingredients to gather. 
  

  
My name is Gordo Ramsey and this is my story. 
  

  
—Egypt.
  
I pushed through the door with the last of my strength before stumbling forward and propping myself up on the wooden produce stand that dominated the center of the small shop. 
  

  
On the third day of my trek through that aired desert, I thought I’d be roasted alive by the sun. seared into my leather jacket and mummified by the many spices I keep on my person at all times like a piece of human jerky. 
  

  
Thankfully, however, my smelling salts were more than enough to keep me going forward. 
  

  
“You better pay for that!” A clear voice called out freeing me from my heat-induced daze. 
  

  
I quickly looked up to the young woman with dark hair who sat behind the long oak cashier's counter nestled between an assortment of spices and brightly packaged products.
  

  
“I’m sorry!?” I said unsure of what I had done wrong.
  

  
“You’re sweating all over my fresh fruit you idiot!” —She leaned over the counter and pointed to a sign hanging in the corner of the shop “You break it you buy it.” —” Nobody wants to eat your sweaty peaches! $2.99 a pound pay up!”
  

  
“Of course! Of course!” I said before pushing the stand and collecting a hand full of peaches. 
  

  
As I stepped up to the counter the strong aroma of spices filled my lungs lifting my spirit and returning my energy.
  

  
 “Where is it?” I asked. “I hear you have it!” I carefully looked at all the slices that lined the shelved but I didn't see it anywhere. 
  

  
“Deodorant?” she shrugged, “Yeah it’s at the back beside the Dutch chocolates.”
  

  
“No! No!” I corrected her “The Spice! Where is the blessed spice!?” 
  

  
“Blessed spice!?” She shrugged and leaned back on her wooden stool. “Listen creeper, we’ve got lots of spices. But none of them will fix your receding hairline or make your wife love you again...”
  

  
“My heart belongs only to cuisine!” I declared placing the peaches on the counter with force, “and to fulfill my vow to that cuisine I need the spice that you alone possess. The leaf of the Thorny Tiger Poppy!”
  

  
She kicked the heel of her boots against her wooden stool as she looked to the ceiling and thought for a moment. “Yeah, I think we got one bottle left... Hey Grandma! We got any more of that weird spice?” 
  

  
A faint unintelligible voice responded from behind a curtain that separated the shop from what I assumed to be a back room.
  

  
“Yeah, we got it. But it’s hecka expensive!” she said.
  

  
“Money is no object!” I said to try my best to contain my excitement. 
  

  
“You sure!?” she replied with doubt in her eyes. “It’s twenty... no thirty dollars”—I immediately threw twenty dollars on the counter—”...an ounce!”
  

  
“I would pay any price for this delicacy,” I said without hesitation. 
  

  
“Alright!” she said rolling her eyes. “Gimme a sec”
  

  
She disappeared behind the curtain and rummaged around in the back room before reappearing after a few moments with a glass bottle in In her hand that was filled with a dark brown spice. 
  

  
“YES! YES THIS IS IT!” I said taking the jar from her hands. “It is just as GLORIOUS as they said! No, it is even more beautiful in person!”
  

  
Filled with joy I danced around the shop like a schoolboy after his first kiss.
  

  
“Woah! Woah! Woah!” she said, “You can’t do that here. I have an allergy to other people's happiness and you’re making me flare up! Just pay for your spice and get a room!”
  

  
“You are a goddess my darling and angel! You have my thanks and my money!”
  

  
And with that, I was one step closer to my destiny.
