James Cutler a man in his late thirties and the lead scientist of the Department of Defence was dressed for the occasion. His long white lab coat was spotless, freshly pressed without a single wrinkle on it. 
  

  
His thinning hair was combed neatly to one side hiding a bit of his reciting hairline. And his black shoes were polished to within an inch of their lives. This was the single biggest day of his career
  

  
So big in fact, he could barely pick his clicker off the desk with his trembling hands. 
  

  
Most of the generals and directors arrived late to the meeting. Not because of their busy schedules, but because most of them didn't much care. 
  

  
“Good evening!” James said as the last few dignitaries took their seats around the large conference table. 
  

  
“Distinguished  Councilman and councilwomen,” he said staring down at his prepared statement. “I’d like to begin by thanking each of you both for your continued support of our research and for taking a little time out of your busy schedule to witness my presentation.”
  

  
“Let’s fast forwards past the pleasantries son!”  General Liam, Drear said peering at his round-rimmed glasses which were too far too small to sit comfortably on his rotund face. “I’m only here to see what you’ve been doing with our taxpayer's dollars.”
  

  
“Wasting it like all the rest of us!” the man sitting across from him said leaning back the leather chair. “If the public knew that we’d all be out of jobs!”
  

  
The room was filled with hearty laughter.
  

  
James was far less amused by the joke. He held his breath as he flipped through his notes skipping past a large portion of his script.
  

  
“For years now we’ve asked questions about the past. Where did we come from? Who built the pyramids of Egypt? How caused the fall those ancient civilizations fall?”
  

  
“And who on Sam Hill asked!” Drear joked losing one final jab. 
  

  
James ignored him and moved on, “ the T.R.V.D is designed to answer questions like these!”
  
James pulled the tarp off of the object that was sitting on a small table to his left and paused for dramatic effect— “T.R.V.D  stands for Temporally Remote Viewing Device!”
  

  
“And what on earth does it do?” Drear asked. 
  

  
“As its name suggests it allows us to view objects remotely from our unique temporal position.”
  

  
“In English son?” Drear said.
  

  
“I think it best to show you an example,” James said. “Does anyone have their cell phone on them?”
  

  
The room was silent everyone looking around the room. 
  

  
“Here you go, son!” Drear slid a black cellphone across the table to James. “My kid got it for me but I still have no clue how to use it! Maybe you can fix my ringtone while you at it!”
  

  
James took the phone and connected it with several log cables to the device. 
  

  
“Please give your attention to the screen,” James said.
  

  
The screen powered on, filling with static at first before settling onto an image of the room. James turned a dial casing the screen to fill with static one again before settling on another image. This time it looked like a quite loving room in a small house.  
  

  
“How did you!?” Drear sat on the edge of his seat and nearly jump out of his chair. “That’s my house! What’s the big Idea son? Has my camera been on all this time?”
  

  
“No Sir!” James said, ”The T.R.V.D allows us to record images of the past. Specifically the past of your cellphone.”
  

  
“That's a cute trick son.” Drear said flustered, “But why are you researching it!”
  

  
“Well, sir!” James explained. “Just imagine what we could do with this technology. Think one of our boys is meeting with the Russians? Use this device to track him backward in time and find the truth.”
  

  
“We could destroy all confidential files and look back at them at any time. The possible applications are endless!.”
  

  
General Drear stood up and leaned over the table. “Who all knows about all this!?” he asked.
