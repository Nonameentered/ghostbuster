If Then Else
  
Part II
  

  
I suddenly felt oddly uneasy and on edge, like a million little eyes were staring down at me, watching, and judging my every move.
  

  
But I couldn't let that distract me now. This is what I had been waiting for, this scene that was playing out in front of me was just the inspiration I needed! 
  

  
The slim man angrily snatched the photograph up off the checkout stand before thrusting it back into his breast pocket in a single smooth motion.
  

  
“That man’s a killer!” He demanded, “If you won't help me stop him... you'll be his next victim!” 
  

  
Exasperated, he turned from the cashier clasping his coat shut over his pistol before stepping towards the door. 
  

  
The cashier gave the man a dirty look, crossed her arms and leaned back.
  

  
“I can take care of myself old man!”
  

  
It was then that I noticed how different the cashier's appearance had become. Her clothes were more worn now, slightly tattered with frayed jagged edges and dark blotchy stain that covered her folded sleeves. 
  

  
Even her disposition had completely changed, the demure and bored expression I’d seen earlier had been replaced by a steely determined glare.
  

  
More strikingly, the eye she’d previously been tucked away under a long piece of brown hair was now completely covered by a black eyepatch. 
  

  
The man didn’t reply, he didn't even look back at her. Instead, he spat on the ground as he walked before raising his head to look at me for a brief moment with is piercing blue eyes. 
  

  
But, before I got a good look at him the chime of the bell that hung above the echoed through the air and he disappeared into the darkness outside. 
  
 
  
*\\\\Amazing! this must be what inspiration is all about! No wonder I haven't been able to write*   
*until now.* 
  

  
My mind was filled with dozen of ideas for the rest of my story. I could see different scenes playing out in my mind's eye, each filled with a unique flavor of creativity. 
  

  
not wanting to lose my newfound inspiration I quickly turned back to my computer to continue writing.
  

  
To my surprise, everything I had just seen was reflected on the page down to the smallest detail. Even the cashier's new look was described just as I’d seen it!
  

  
*//I guess it’s true what they say: good stories write themselves!*
  

  
I sat down and cracked my knuckles again, my fingers were trembling  with anticipation.
  

  
But before I could lay a finger ion the keyboard to type another word a flood of messages from my boss began to pop up on screen.
  

  
(*3 minutes ago:* “Where are you? You’re late for work!”)
  

  
(*1 minute ago:* “Chris! We need you in the office...”)
  

  
(*now:* “GET DOWN HERE NOW!!!!!”)
  

  
In a panic, I quickly closed my laptop, slid it into it’s carrying bag, and slung it over my shoulder without even thinking twice. I’d never been late to work before!
  

  
But as I straightened up and my laptop powered down, I suddenly felt dizzy like marbles were spinning around in my head. I closed my eyes tightly as I swayed forward almost losing my balance. A moment later when I opened my eyes again everything around me was back to normal.
  

  
The sun was out again, the wind had quieted down, and the cashier was back to her normal boring self.
  

  
*//well, “The Lord Giveth and the Lord Taketh Away.”* 
  

  
my inspiration was gone. 
  

  
I shook my head and rubbed my eyes before collecting what remained of my drink and pastry and heading out the door.

Before long I was stepping off the elevator on the 32nd floor of the downtown SouthBridge office building located at 1931, Denard street. 
  

  
The interior of the building was pristine as ever. The white marble tiles lead out of the elevator contrasting greatly against the mat-black  and grey walls that were decorated with yellow accents. 
  

  
A piercing alarm blared as I stepped through the arch-shaped scanner that separated the office from the outside world.
  

  
“Unauthorized code detected!” —a synthesized voice warned—“Please wait for security to arrive at your location!”
  

  
The warning repeated itself a few times before a security administrator walked around the corner with a sour expression on his face. 
  

  
“C’mon man, how many times do I have to tell you to stop downloading random stuff off the inter”—the guard stopped dead in his tracks with a shocked look on his face— “Sorry! I didn't realize you guys could... I mean, why are you carrying code in from outside?”
  

  
“Sorry! I don’t usually bring my personal laptop in” I explained, “I just started working   
on a new project and I lost track of time!”
  

  
“Lost track of time? How can a... Forget it,”—he pressed a button deactivating the alarm— “‘Anyway, you know the rules. No forging code of any kind on this level. Either delete it or leave your device with me!“
  

  
“Sorry again!” I apologized lifting the strap of my laptop off my shoulder before   
handing it to the security admin. “I’ll pick it back up on my way out okay!?”
  

  
Another day another new task to learn... this time all I had to do was I memorized a group of twelve faces and then search for matches in some surveillance footage. Then I just created an algorithm that would tag any live footage with containing one or more of the twelve faces and send this information with the location in the metadata to a secures server as instructed.
