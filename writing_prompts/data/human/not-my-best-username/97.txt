Don't worry. I have a contact in the FBI. Give him a few days, a can of orange Fanta, and those three wacky numbers on the back of your Roblox gift cards, and I promise, it will be like we never even met.
  

  
I do have to warn you that you wonâ€™t be able to use that username in Columba in the foreseeable future. But, it's a small price to pay for anonymity online.
