It’s a year ago today since the funeral. I can still picture all those black suits and long dark dresses towering over me like the trees of a shadowy forest as I sat inconsolably by the whole and the ground that became my friend’s new home. 
  

  
It was raining that day, much like the rain that poured down the windows of my tiny apartment meant this dreary morning. 
  

  
It’s been a year and I still find myself turning left when I should turn right. It’s hard to remember I have no one to visit on my way home from work anymore.
  

  
I got up, brushed my teeth, and tried to wish away the dark circles from under my eyes. It was going to be another long day.
  

  
The coffee maker hummed to life as I flipped the switch to power it on and filled the basin with water. Despite everything that’s changed so suddenly, the taste of coffee is still the same, Bitter and unrelenting. 
  

  
Before I could pour myself a cup there were a series of loud knocks at the front door. 
  

  
Who could it be? I wondered, It’s not like anyone ever visits me. And who’d be crazy enough to it in the rain of all times?
  

  
As I opened the door I was greeted by the wagging finger and generally angry expression of the mailman or mailwoman I guess I should say.  
  

  
I could see the steam of her breath rasing into the cold air as she berated me for forgetting to empty my mailbox again.
  

  
The only reason it was full all the time was because of those insistent advertisements. It seems the only one interested in sending me mail as your good old friend at Happy Healthy Co. 
  

  
Maybe their cringy jingle was true, “We’re always there when you need at the price that you want!”
  

  
After a good tongue lashing for my friendly neighborhood postal worker and after swearing on the life of my unborn firstborn to empty out my mailbox once a week, she handed me a letter in a white envelope and made me sign for it.  
  

  
I tossed the unopened envelope on the table and poured myself a cup of coffee. But as I leaned back and brought the mug to my lips I noticed it, the name on the envelope. 
  

  
That can’t be! I told myself. 
  

  
Hot coffee burnt the tips of my fingers as I slammed the mug on the table while reaching with my other hand to pick up the envelope.
  

  
It really was for her... I couldn’t believe it!
  

  
I took a knife and cut the top of the envelope open. What could it say? When did she send it? And why?
  

  
My hand shook as I pulled the paper from the envelope. I turned it around and look on both sides.
  

  
It was a completely blank piece of paper. 
  

  
What a joke! I said to myself, I guess even from beyond the grave she always gets the last laugh.
  

  
But I couldn’t get it out of my mind as I downed my first cup of coffee. The blank page just seemed to stare at me and mock me as if I was the only one in the world that couldn’t read it.
  

  
There was another loud knock at the door. I must have been soo deep in thought I’d missed the first few knocks. Whoever was at the door was pounding on it like their life depended on it. 
  

  
I snapped to my feet spilling coffee on the table in the process as I hurried to the door. 
  

  
“Keep your pant on, I’m coming!” I yelled to the door.
  

  
I hurried down the hall, grabbed the handle, and wrenched the door open. What on earth could they want now!?
  

  
To my surprise, there was no one at the door. I shield my head from the rain as I stepped out and looked both ways down the street. 
  

  
There was no one, nothing insight for the whole block. 
  

  
I walked back inside and closed the door behind me. It was too early for anything like this. 
  

  
I was greeted by quite the mess when I returned to the table. I had spilled more coffee than I thought. The table cloth was soaked and so was that blank piece of paper. 
  

  
But it wasn’t blank anymore, was it?
  

  
The coffee stains were clearly darker in some areas of the page than others. It was like... letters no, I could faintly make out the few words of a sentence. 
  

  
I dumped the rest of my coffee on the page and waited for a few seconds. Sure enough, words began to slowly paint themselves in dark brown letters on the soaked page. 
  

  
“*Dear friend*” it read “*I suppose it’s already been a year for you. I know this is probably weird for you but, I need you to do something for me. There is a* *~~Mchien~~*   *at 2437 Jonfeild way in Cindly. Please go there an...*”
  

  
I couldn’t make out what the rest of the letter said.
  

  
Why did she send it to me? And when? What was waiting for me at 2437 Jonfield way?
  

  
I guess there’s only one way to find out, old friend.
