That all too familiar plasticy clack filled the small room as the controller flew from his hand and skittered across the wooden floor.
  

  
“Dude my controller!” I snapped raising my hands over my head in protest without taking my eyes off the screen. “I know you don’t like to lose but—my guy—no need to take it out on the merchandise! Princess Lassie doesn't deserve that kind of abuse!”
  

  
I leaped to my feet and victoriously raised my hands in the air as I crossed the finish line. First Place! Another win for Beastmaster64!
  

  
I did my little dance before turning to face him and enjoying my customary gloating/roasting session. 
  

  
But this time was different. He wasn’t sitting there pouting like he usually did after a crushing defeat. He was doubled over on the couch clutching his head and cupping his eyes with both of his hands.
  

  
“Woah, dude! What's wrong!?” I asked looking down at him unsure of what to do.
  

  
But he didn’t say anything. He didn’t even move. He just sat there almost curling up in a ball.
  

  
“C’mon man... you.. You... good!? ” I said before dropping my controller on the couch and taking a knee beside him. “What is it!? Do you need your inhaler!? You gotta talk to me, man!” I pleaded. But still, he didn't respond   
  

  
I could see tears escaping from his hands and streaming down his arms to drip off his elbows and onto the floor.
  

  
“Holy sh- are you crying!?”
  

  
I put my hand on his shoulder and tried to crack a joke. “C’mon dude it can’t be that bad to lose to a girl can it!”—I flinched back nearly falling flat on my but as he snapped his head up and looked me with wild eyes.
  
“Jake!? You’re scaring me!” 
  

  
I awkwardly clambered to my feet.
  

  
“Tell me you remember!” Jake said still cradling his skull, “Nobody else does! It’s like it never happened... Like he never existed!”—He sprung to his feet closing the distance—”Tell me you remember! Cass! Please tell me you remember him! Please” His voice was shaking and desperate as his whole body began to quake. 
  

  
“Remember!?” I said before taking a step back “remember who? What are you talking about”
  

  
He shook his head and furiously scratched his scalp causing loose hairs to fall to  the ground. “I... I... I can’t remember his name... I see his face... J-J Joey! His name was Joey” His words seem to devolve into horrible meaningless noises as he wobbled unsteadily in front of me
  

  
“Crap! I think you’re having another episode!” I said noticing the blood as it began to drip out of his nose and down his face. “Crap dude! I don’t remember what to do!”
  

  
His legs shook before finally giving  out from under him as he fell forward and collapsed into my arms. I wasn’t stung enough to catch him so he ended up taking me with him in his trouble to the ground. 
  

  
“C’mon Jake! Be Okay! Please you have to be okay!” I shouted as his limp body lay in my lap. 
  

  
After a few deafening seconds he spoke. 
  

  
“5721 Hallow street, 44231. 5721 Hallow street, 44231. 5721 Hallow street, 44231. 5721 Hallow street, 44231. 5721 Hallow street, 44231. ” His words became weaker with every repetition. “5721 Hallow street, 44231. 5721 Hallow street, 44231. ”
