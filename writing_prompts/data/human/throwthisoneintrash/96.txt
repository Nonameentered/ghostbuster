Okay. I need help with revealing a
mysteries in my writing. My question is: how do you pace a reveal? 

It feels like there’s three pitfalls.

1. You don’t foreshadow enough for the reveal to make sense or be satisfying. 
2. You take too long to reveal the answers that the reader has figured out and the characters look unintelligent. 
3. You reveal things too quickly and the tension is gone. 
 
Help?
