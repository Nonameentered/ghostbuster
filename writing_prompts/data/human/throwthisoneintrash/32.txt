This was so heartwarming!

I think it’s good to avoid adverbs in general, but there were a few moments where I had wished I knew *how* something was said or done. 

One that stood out to me was: I nodded. You could try something like “I nodded excitedly.” It might give the reader more of a sense of the characters and their thoughts. 

But this was a great little moment and I’m glad you shared it with us!
