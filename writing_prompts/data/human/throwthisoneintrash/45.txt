The executioner gasped as he was hoisted up and dropped down on a cart. The fleeing man stopped glowing and instead started prodding him and poking him. 

“You’ve eaten a sturdy diet?”

“What?” He wanted to leap up and confront the escapee, but was so short of breath all he could mutter was “yes.” 

“Good. Hold still.” 

Without much of a choice, the executioner lay there as a golden light emerged from the escapee. It floated in the air until it landed on his face and then was inside him. 

His mind fought against the intrusion, it was like battling a headache by sheer force of will alone. The *thing* that was now inside his head seemed to be spreading throughout his body like a cold chill. 

A thought was impressed upon him. 

*Hold still. I’m almost done. You will fade away soon.* 

With everything he had, the executioner fought back. The golden light eventually gave up. But the energy and power inside his body stayed. 

He hopped back up, finding his limbs powerful and quick. This was something he had dreamed of. He was invincible. 

Finding his axe, he lifted it in the air and shouted. No longer would he wait for criminals to be tried by judges, he had the power and invincibility to seek out the evil in his city and deal the death blow on his terms. He was judge, jury, and…

**The Executioner.**
