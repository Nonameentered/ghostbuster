“I was wondering why you left me a trail of rose petals if you didn’t know it’s our anniversary.”

“Wait, where do you see a trail of rose petals?” Brian asked. 

Annette turned around and was surprised to find the floor empty. “I could have sworn…”

“I just got you this mirror with the rose accents along the sides. It seemed to suit you.”

Annette started at the mirror, trying to sift through her emotions. Her husband forget their wedding anniversary, and yet he had brought her something truly magical. This mirror almost seemed to be calling to her. Like it wanted her to step through it. 

The slight ripples in the mirror’s surface obscured the dark objects she had seen before, but they became clear as she stepped back. They were more rose petals, in a distinct path, winding upward at an angle into the dreamy landscape of the mirror’s world. 

Without thinking, she walked towards it, stepping through the liquid mirror and into the clouds beyond.

Brian turned to face the dark creature now standing in the bedroom doorway. 

“You we’re right,” he said, “much cheaper than a divorce.” 

The creature nodded.
