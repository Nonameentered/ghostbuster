Dear Linda,

I am so excited to have you as a desk mate now that we have implemented a night shift. Please feel free to use whatever you need to during your shift. I expect that we will have to split the desk drawers for individual items so I will take the top drawer (my back could not handle all of the bending down to the lower one) and you can have the much larger lower drawer. But please, if there is anything you need, just fire me an email and I will be glad to make things more comfortable for you during your shift.

Have a wonderful night!

Claire

##Post-it note:

Linda, honey, please leave the top drawer for me. I found some long hairs in there this morning and I would much rather not have that in the drawer where I keep my personal effects.

Clean up your workstation after use. It’s our policy for desk sharing.

Linda,

I'm sure you’ve seen the sign posted above our workstation. Management sure has a thing for cleanliness, haha. 

I’ll help by doing my part and keeping my things confined to my desk drawer and tidying up the remaining areas before the end of my shift. Can I count on you to do the same? 

Thanks, Deary! 

Claire

##Post-it note:

Linda, The smell from your personal desk drawer is too much for my coworkers to handle. Since they are complaining, can you be a dear and clean out your things.

##Email (CC’d to the manager):

Linda,

I find it difficult to work in an environment that has not been kept clean and free of offensive odours. Now I know that you have tried your best, but the smells are too much for many of us in the office to cope with. I have requested that maintenance open your drawer. Please do not take offence, this is merely a precaution for the health of our staff.

Claire

##Email from Management

All Staff,

There have been some misuses of the office furniture. Please abide by the posted safety signs regarding posture and seated positions. Please also refrain from using desk drawers to hatch reptilian eggs. The offending organic material has been disposed of safely, but we must all be diligent to keep our workstations clean. 

Regards

##Voicemail from Claire to Linda

Linda, dearest, I am so embarrassed about the incident with the eggs. I had no idea you were such an animal lover. I have a cat myself, named Princess, and we adore her. Anyway, I wanted to call and apolog— Oh, there you are in the hall. Well I guess this is awkward, haha. I’ll just say hi in person. Oh, oh my! You have scales, and… and claws! And teeth! What teeth! I never knew. Linda? Linda, stop! Lindaaaaa!
