#Terror at the Docks

WC 464

***

Hiding behind one of the many crates piled up near the docks, Rick held his flashlight up to his face. The light never reached his eyes, making him seem more phantom than man. 

“They say he swoops down from the sky, lurking atop buildings, bringing people so close to death that they long for it. And then he leaves them in a puddle of their own blood.”

“You’ve retold that same story a thousand times,” Jim said. 

“Doesn’t make it false does it?” 

“But it’s kinda annoying, every time we do a job at night, you try to spook me with it.” 

“What else are we gonna talk about?” 

Jim looked around. The dense fog at the docks gave the night air a clammy feel, like he was enveloped in someone’s sweat. He shivered in disgust. 

Finally, three flashes of light blinked at them from a moored ship. It was time. They scuttled down to a chain that secured the ship to land. Then they took careful, practiced steps up the makeshift tightrope and onto the deck. 

“Boss says we grab the red bags only, then bolt.” Rick reaffirmed. 

They crept towards the storage room, Jim felt a tingling sensation on the back of his neck. It was like he was being watched. 

“I think your stories are getting to me,” he said to Rick. 

“Not stories,” he replied, flipping through keys on his key holder. “I’ve seen the creature myself.”

“Who cares If it’s true or not, we’ve got a job to do and your stupid stories are messing with my head, man.” 

They loaded two red bags onto each of their shoulders and Jim stepped back out onto the deck, just in time to see a hook whiz past him and anchor itself to the wall. 

“It’s him!” Rick yelled and ran across to the other side of the boat, diving into the water. 

After the expected splash, Jim heard another splash, then some sputtering. He heard Jim’s voice as he was hauled back on deck and beaten. 

Jim ran. 

This goddamn legend was real.  No one remembered when it started, but it was real and it had found them. He sprinted for the main gangplank, not caring whether or not anyone saw him. 

A black figure appeared in front of him somehow. Pointed ears above a mask that seamlessly melded into a trailing cape. The monster towered above him as he cowered behind the two red bags he held out in front of him. 

“Going somewhere?” the creature said. 

“I…I…” Jim stuttered and then sank to his knees. It was no use. No one who ever ran had escaped. He knew he wouldn’t die, but that he would wish that he had. Because no one had ever escaped from…

***The Batman.***
