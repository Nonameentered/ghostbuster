<3/3>

The job was a bit more than what I expected. The old bank was heavily guarded, but I had a vast inventory of tricks up my sleeve, so to speak. 

Getting past the facial recognition was easy, but there were those dogs. 

I reached into my duffel bag and brought out a cornucopia of scents. Fresh meat, skunk cabbage, flowering fields, mildew; the scent-dissent device worked beautifully as I set it down behind an advertisement wall. 

While the dogs and their caretakers were distracted, running around the bank, I slipped into the back, crouching down below the desks. 

This would be the tricky part. I had to use skill and smarts to retrieve the keys to the vault from the manager’s desk. The last time I tried… well, never mind about that. I had to stay focused. 

I skulked along the office furniture, keeping an eye out for trouble. I saw the keys dangling from a peg in the manager’s office. 

Just then, the old manager returned to his desk. Thinking quickly, I pretended to be picking something up, then rose from my crouched position. 

“Hello, I’m here to talk about a loan.”

He seemed to buy my story. Soon I was seated in his office, the keys just dangling there in front of me, when I decided to be brave and….

A bright green bar flashed between me and the bank manager. 

*Would you like to save? Add seven credits to save at this location.* 

I sighed. It looked like a battle was coming up. I pulled up my credit wallet and sent seven credits to the game. 

I hated the Rose level, but I had to beat my little brother’s high score or I’d never hear the end of it. 

*Thank you, enjoy playing ROSE RECONNAISSANCE.*
