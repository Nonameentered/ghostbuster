# The Masterpiece

WC 416 (Including title)

As distilled sunlight melted through the leaves of the towering trees bordering the campsite, Odyca carefully cut into a burger on the grill. They were nearly perfect. Seasoned lightly, then topped with a thick slice of cheddar, they sizzled above the charcoal bricks glowing red.

Hrowta leaned over the grill, practically drooling. He watched with awe as Odyca meticulously stacked ingredients and then sandwiched them in a bun. It was a feast for all of the senses.

Although Hrowta was eager to dive into the delectable creation, it was Liaa that would be the true judge. Every detail had to be in place before presenting the final story to her. The mouthwatering meal told a tale of toil and care rarely given to campside food. It spoke of the kind of heartfelt passion Odyca was known for. A desire to see things through and make them the best that they can be.

Hrowta sat and watched the platter descend onto the picnic table, guided by Odyca’s hands. He stared and licked his lips.

Liaa waited until it was set down. She appraised the display with keen eyes. She reached forward and pulled one of the perfect burgers from the platter and looked it over. The bun soaked up all of the rich flavour from the meat, tomatoes, lettuce, onions, mayo, and mustard.

She took one bite.

Hrowta gasped. This was the moment of decision. This was the awards ceremony and the final judgement. This was—

She smiled.

Liaa’s eyes softened as she ate another bite, then another, then another. The look of satisfaction on her face made Odyca’s normally-stoic face brighten just a little. She nodded at him and sighed, enjoying every last morsel of the delicious burger.

They both talked about the seasoning, the preparation, and the cook time required to build such a masterpiece. When they had finished, Odyca reached over to the plate instinctively, his hand feeling for his own meal.

“I thought…” Hrowta said, in a muffled voice.

Odyca looked at him. The mustard dripping from his chin made a line pointing to his overstuffed mouth. He swallowed and continued, “I thought there were two for me. Did you not eat one already?”

Odyca’s calm demeanour altered slightly. His eyes went from serene, to red with rage, then back to serene. He sighed and opened the cooler sitting beside the picnic table.

“There’s no taking you anywhere,” he said, as he slapped another burger on the grill with a sizzle.
