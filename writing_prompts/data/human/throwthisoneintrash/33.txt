"Sir, are you ready?"

"There's no point in waiting, Reinia. Let's open the door and accept our fate."

The door slammed open, much louder than either of them had hoped.  

"There's no one here, Commander."

"Head for the jungle anyway, I'll cover your blind spots."

"Do you see the glowing purple eyes in the dark?"

"Yes, I think Iâ€”"

"Lieutenant, look out!" 

A hail of laser blasts filled the dark sky. The two survivors looked at each other, resignation on their faces.

"It was a good run, Sir." 

"You wee the best officer I could have ever asked for."

As tears rolled down the cheeks of both of them, the laser trails stood still. Sounds dimmed, and they were locked in that moment. 

"I... I don't know what's happening, Sir. I would have thought we would be dead by now." 

"It certainly seems like we have been paused."

A third voice boomed through the air. "Alright, that's enough. I fear I will never get any creative last words at this rate."

"Wait! Stop!" Reinia yelled.

"I have stopped your time. What is it?"

"Who are you?" she yelled, "What do you want?" 

"I am fascinated by the experiences of mortals. I pause almost all final moments for study."

"Then what?" The Commander asked.

"Then, I let them pass into nothingness."

"Could you not this time?" they both pleaded.

"I'm sorry. I will see you again on the next round of your life cycle."

"Our what?" Reinia asked.

The commander shrugged, and they both woke up again as infants, without any prior memories.
