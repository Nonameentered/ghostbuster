Hey Atcroft!

I really enjoyed the direction you took with this one. I loved the character and it was an interesting premise. 

One thing I think you could take a second look at is how separated the scenes are. I don't mean the lines, that is a stylistic choice that I think is interesting, but the way in which the story feels like it doesn't tie together as well as it could. 

It would be nice to have something leading the reader from one section toe the other. Maybe it is revealed that the pain in Jim's eyes is a doctor shining a flashlight into his eyes or something. A connection between the scenarios would go a long way in making the transitions between scenes feel more natural. 

But it was a fun story overall and I'm so glad you wrote!
