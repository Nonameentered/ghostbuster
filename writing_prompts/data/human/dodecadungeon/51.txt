All good, hope your wifi issue gets resolved. Here's the next part! - 

“Here’s the guard uniform and patrol patterns, your name is in the system, this should be all you need to get in,” Wylan explained.

Nydas took the uniform and nodded, “thank you, Wylan. This means a lot to me.”

Wylan smiled, “it was nothing.”

Nydas grinned, “still, I think you deserve payment.”

Wylan chuckled, “what did you have in mind?”

Nydas smirked and tackled Wylan in a hug, pulling him close, “how’s this?”

Wylan blushed, hugging back, “that’s much more than the favor was worth, here, let me give you your change.” He laughed, hugging back, stroking Nydas’ back gently, running his hand up to Nydas’ shoulder, causing him to wince. Wylan gasped, “Nydas, are you alright? What’s wrong?”

Nydas shook his head, “it’s nothing, I’m fine.”

Wylan frowned, “it didn’t sound like nothing.”

Nydas forced a smile, “just a little bruise, nothing to concern yourself with.”

Wylan sighed, “bruises don’t hurt from a hug.”

Nydas shrugged, “well, this one does.”

Wylan giggled, “while your excuses are adorable, I’m not buying it.”

“Fine, I got in a fight,” Nydas admitted.

Wylan gasped, “oh no! Should we get you to a healer? I’m the crown prince, I can have the royal healer over here within the hour just-”

Nydas cut him off, “Wylan! None of that. I’m a thief, remember? That will never work, besides, this isn’t the first scrape I’ve been in. I’ve patched myself up from much worse.”

Wylan winced, “that’s not as comforting as you think it is.”

Nydas laughed, “your concern is cute, but I’m fine, I promise.”

Wylan rolled his eyes, “at least let me see the wound.”

Nydas smirked, “this is just an excuse to get me to take my shirt off, I’m not buying it.”

Wylan blushed, “n-no, I was just-”

Nydas chuckled and pecked Wylan’s cheek, “I’m just teasing you. Not that I would mind terribly,” Wylan winked, causing Wylan to blush further.

Wylan coughed, “so um.. what are you planning with that uniform anyway?”

Nydas sighed, “I wish I could tell you, but this is something I must do alone.”

Wylan gritted his teeth, “I don’t like this, Nydas.”

“I don’t either, but please, I need to leave you out of this?”

“And if this goes wrong, whatever it is? How will I get ahold of you?”

“Let’s just hope it doesn’t come to that.”

“Nydas, you can’t just say that and expect me to let you go through with this. Please say you’re messing with me…”

“I’m not. And if it goes wrong, so be it. You’ve only known me for a few days anyway.”

Wylan’s expression softened, “Nydas…”

Nydas winced, “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean it like that, it’s just… you have more important things than me to worry about.”

“You’re important to me, Nydas. I know it’s irrational, you stole from me and we’ve only known each other for a few days, but every time we speak it’s magic.  A single glance from you leaves me breathless. I want you to know that.”

“You’re important to me too, Wylan. That’s why I want you to stay out of this. I don’t want you to get hurt.”

“That’s not your choice to make.”

“But telling you is mine. And I’m not going to.”

“Dammit, Nydas!”

“I’m sorry…” Nydas raised an eyebrow, “you’ve been a lot more… emotional than usual. Unlike that strong-postured regal man I’m used to seeing, what’s wrong.”

Wylan sighed, “see, this is what I mean, Nydas. We’ve only known each other for a few days but you still know when I’m hurting.”

Nydas blushed, “I know, it’s special… but we’re both putting ourselves in danger, it’s only going to hurt more when things go wrong.”

Wylan shook his head, “all the more reason to stay together, to make sure things don’t go wrong.”

“I wish that logic were sound. But it isn’t, and neither are you. You’re too emotionally compromised for this. What’s wrong, Wylan?”

“It’s Acrasia, she won’t speak to me.”

“Is it because you used her to coax information out of Diane?”

“Of course it is. I didn’t think it would be this bad, hells, I sure was wrong.”

“So what are you going to do?”

Wylan sighed, “I don’t know… I tried to get ahold of Diane to get the two to reunite, but she’s busy right now. I had Rene look into it, I think Diane might be doing something for her employer, though I hope for Acrasia’s sake she isn’t.”

Nydas nodded, “that’s not an easy situation. Though Diane should be available soon, you can try that plan then.”

Wylan smiled, “yeah, there’s still hope. Thanks, Nydas.”

Nydas grinned, “anytime. Who’s Rene? Your servant or something?”

Wylan shook his head, “no, he’s sort of my advisor. He wasn’t initially going to be my advisor, actually. The previous advisor was killed by a similar illness to the one my father has, so Acrasia and I are looking into that. After he died, my father replaced him with Rene, which has taken some getting used to, he used to be a commoner, it seems.”

Nydas raised an eyebrow, “Wylan… are you making the connection that I am?”

Wylan blinked, “I’m not sure I am.”

Nydas sighed, “Wylan, Rene fits the bill for the employer.”

“Are you sure?” asked Wylan. “Because Nydas, that’s quite the accusation.”

“Think about it, Wylan. It’s a special illness affecting your father that only a few people would be able to inflict and it also just happened to strike your former advisor putting Rene at the seat of power? Not to mention that he’s a commoner, the crown guard said that the employer was one of them, a commoner. How many other commonfolk are there in the castle? Not many, I’d imagine.”

“I just had Rene compile a list of commoners, so we’ll have to see, but you’re most likely right.”

“Wait, you told Rene? If he finds out you’re onto him that could put you in serious danger. You said it yourself that there’s a good chance once your father dies you’ll be made a puppet king by whoever has the Scepter of Rulership. Rene is your advisor, who else has that much access to your ear?”

“Hells, you’re right. He has also been asking me to grand him privileges to command the crown guard without my approval, and I saw him talking to some crown guard in hushed tones at the last gala. I should have told you about Rene earlier, I just didn’t think… hells, what do we do? What does this mean?”

Nydas hummed in thought, “you need to shadow him as close as possible, don’t let him know we’re onto him, but extract as much information as you can. Don’t reveal too much to him, and let me know anything you find.”

Wylan nodded, “will do. Perhaps shadowing him will lead us to the scepter. That’s infused with ether, if my research is correct. I’m worried about what he could do if he gets his hands on more of it.”

Nydas blinked, “what do you mean?”

“When Acrasia and I researched ether, we learned that it’s highly addictive to mages who use it regularly,” Wylan explained. “Their bodies come to rely on it. If Rene, if that is the employer, has mages at his disposal, he could control them through their reliance on ether. The scepter will be hard enough to deal with… add that to the mix, well, it’s worrisome to say the least.”

Nydas cursed, “dammit! One of my friends is a mage, they could be trying to break him, get him to join their side. I only hope he can hold out for a little longer.”

Wylan placed his hand on Nydas’ shoulder, “have faith, we’ll help your friends soon enough. I’ll let you know as soon as I learn more about Rene.”

Nydas nodded solemnly, “thanks.”

Wylan sighed, “don’t think I’ve forgotten about the troublesome thing you’re doing. I don’t know what it is, and I still don’t condone it, but I know I’d be a fool to stop you. So, good luck, and if you change your mind, I’m more than happy to help. And leave a note or something, in case it goes wrong, I want to be able to help.”

Nydas smiled weakly, “I will. Thank you, Wylan, for everything. And you’ll make things right with your sister, I know you will.”

Wylan gave him a hug, “and whatever you do, don’t let that lovely face of yours get hurt. Alright?”

Nydas chuckled, “I promise. I’ll be back before you know it. Goodbye, Wylan.”

Wylan broke from the hug, waving, “goodbye, Nydas.”

Nydas waved to Wylan before leaping out of the window. Wylan already had enough to worry about, he didn’t need to worry about him too. Wylan was a good man, and a prince. Nydas thought perhaps it would be better of he failed his mission. That way Wylan could forget about him and focus on the future and his kingdom. Nydas already hurt relations between Wylan and his sister, and if Wylan had found a way to join Nydas on his mission, he would get hurt too. Nydas nursed his shoulder and sighed, shifting into the darkness.
