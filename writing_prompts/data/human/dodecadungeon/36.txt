“Ah… shit…” I cursed.
  

  
“What’s wrong?” Darren asked.
  

  
“They have a grenade,” I answered.
  

  
“So, just dodge it, you’ve dodged bombs before,” Darren replied.
  

  
I shook my head, “No, you idiot, he’s a resetter, like me.”
  

  
Darren’s eyes widened, “Oh… wait, what does that mean again?”
  

  
I groaned, “It means he can throw the grenade, reset the state of the bomb after it explodes and keep using it over and over.”
  

  
Darren nodded in understanding, “Oh, okay. Just how you reset your gun for infinite bullets?”
  

  
I grinned, “Exactly like that.”
  

  
Darren scratched his chin, “Well, what if you just caught the grenade?”
  

  
I gasped, “Are you insane? It will explode!”
  

  
Darren smirked, “No it worked, just reset it to before the pin was pulled.”
  

  
I chuckled, “Darren, you’re a genius! That will leave him without the grenade and no danger to me! Alright, now let’s go show him what a real resetter can do.”
