“It’s got to be Ol’ Runner, the odds are in his favor!”
  

  
I chuckle as I hear the betters banter among each other, holding out my hand to give the strings of fate a little yank. Suddenly, what made sense is now thrown into disarray, Ol’ Runner falls behind, the three-legged horse scampers ahead, horses crash into each other, those in the stands are brought the wrong food orders, can’t find their seats, and the announcer mixes up the ads with the stats leading to some strange announcements, everything is complete chaos. But most importantly, Ol’ Runner lost.
  

  
Never tell me the odds. Not because I’ll try to prove them wrong, but because I’ll ruin them. I’m a menace at sports games, casinos, board game nights, and pretty much anywhere and anything that has a degree of chance. It doesn’t benefit me. Ruining one horse’s chance of winning does potentially increase the chances of the others, but it’s random, it would be foolish to bet. The benefit I get is the chaos itself.
  

  
It’s an amusing thing to watch. We try so hard to make our world neat and orderly, but so much of it is dictated by chance. It is freeing for me, to completely relinquish control and watch everything fall apart.
  

  
Never tell me the odds, for you don’t understand chance like I do.
