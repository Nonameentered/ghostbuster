Gazes interlocked as they rush closer to each other. Expressions changing as they notice one other, anticipation building as they continue moving closer. Their hearts pounding in their chests, their voices catching in their throats from nervousness and not knowing the perfect thing to say. Closer and closer still, adjusting their posture, hands clammy, blood rushing to their faces, forming flushed cheeks in the biting cold.
  

  
They collide, both gasping. Time seems to slow as they lock together, muscles shaking, gazes held, breathless. They tumble on the ground together, sounds of victory echoing out as they roll together, inches apart. The embrace only lasts for a minute, but it feels like an eternity. They scramble to their feet, faces red from adrenaline and exertion, rushing towards one another once more.
  

  
They speak no words, but their actions say volumes. They let the moment linger, both knowing it eventually must come to an end. It’s painful, quick, exhilarating, but temporary. Though they will reunite again soon. And until then, they’ll be preparing, always on each other’s minds.
  

  
Jousting is a thrilling sport indeed.
