“Oh! You must be the defender of the Argitheon!” Reila said with a smile.
  

  
The defender sighed, “that would be me.”
  

  
Reila chuckled, “so exasperated! You must be tired of having to fight a bunch of weaklings that try to enter here, don’t worry, I’ll put up a good fight!”
  

  
The defender shook his head, “no, just tired. I’ve fought my share of battles, I’m just waiting for my call of duty here to end.”
  

  
Reila frowned, “that’s no way to look at things, you can find excitement in anything, you just have to look hard enough.”
  

  
The defender snorted, “I admired your optimism, traveler. But I do not share that sentiment. I know what I like, and fighting is no longer among that list.”
  

  
Reila sighed, “I’m sorry to hear that, what’s your name?”
  

  
“Vellan.”
  

  
Reila smiled, “a pleasure to meet you, Vellan! I’m Reila.”
  

  
Vellan grinned, “a fine name.”
  

  
Reila smirked, “it sure is! I hope to have the title of sorceress one day though!” She grinned, letting lightning crackle in her hands.
  

  
Vellan nodded, “impressive, I’m sure that you’ll reach that title with your fierce determination.”
  

  
Reila beamed, “thanks, Vellan! What about you? What do you want to do with yourself?”
  

  
Vellan sighed, “settle down maybe, become a farmer. I’m no good here anymore.”
  

  
Reila frowned, “don’t say that! I’ve heard legends about the defenders of Argitheon, they are some of the fiercest fighters in all the realm!”
  

  
Vellan shrugged, “there’s a lot of loss that comes with being a fighter.”
  

  
Reila scratched her head, “maybe I can help you find your spark again?”
  

  
Vellan shook his head, “I’m past that, Reila.”
  

  
Reila glared at him, “come on! Don’t give up already! At least let me try!”
  

  
Vellan scratched his chin in thought before nodding, “fine. I’ll give you a chance. If you can find my spark, I’ll let you into the Argitheon without a fight.”
  

  
Reila smiled, “challenged accepted!”
  

  
Vellan couldn’t have known it then, but the spark he would find was not in some activity or hobby, but rather in Reila herself.
