Penguins can’t fly.
  

  
That’s what Jeremiah was told his entire life. Jeremiah is a human name, they said. Why not choose a penguin name like Ice Cube or Puddles. But no, he would be Jeremiah. And he would fly.
  

  
He had heard tales of penguins flying in days past, but the others told him that was all myth, false propaganda. Yet still, he trained, working to make his wings have enough strength to carry him throughout the sky.
  

  
Even when the others were faced with the actual flight of the penguin, they could not accept it as real. And as the giant penguin finally took flight and eventually disappeared, the friends looked at each other and burst out laughing.
