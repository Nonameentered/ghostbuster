Where I come from, chickens are extinct. We still eat chicken, but it is produced in a lab, artificial meat grown in a test tube. It isn’t the same. My grandfather used to tell me stories about what real chicken tasted like. It was such a versatile food, with a crispy breading outside it could be made into a greasy, delicious piece of fried chicken. Rotated on a spit and cooked to a golden brown with spices sprinkled atop it, it could be made into a gourmet rotisserie chicken dinner. Though best of all, spicy buffalo sauce could be poured over it, and thus, the chicken wing could be eaten. But no more.
  

  
We had made mistakes, I don’t remember exactly what they were, something to do with climate and overfarming perhaps, also little defense against the epidemic that struck them, I presume. Regardless, there was a time before we made that mistake, a time with chicken. I should have known it wouldn’t have been that easy.
  

  
I attempted to find a way to live that life. One with real food, where the air was clean and the rivers were blue. I devoted my life to finding the answer. While I failed to find a way to travel back in time before that mistake, I found another way: to travel to a timeline where chickens weren’t extinct.
  

  
Though those timelines had their own problems. I realized my mistake as soon as I opened the portal to another timeline. Otherworldly creatures streamed in, and I went out, leaving the world behind. What I saw on the other side was a world no better than mine. While they still had chicken, the world was in shackles.
  

  
Life forms from a far-off galaxy had arrived at our home to subjugate it. They fixed the damage we had done to our world, but conquered us and made us slaves in return. Only they got to enjoy the privilege of chicken.
  

  
I raced into the nearest chicken shop and grabbed a bucket from one of the patrons, raced out of the facility, and headed back to the portal. I was pursued by the creatures, heading toward the portal after me. I leaped through, but so had they.
  

  
I was the only one who knew how to stop them, so I contacted the military and got them to fly in, assisting our small town and freeing it from those creatures. While our world had already sustained much damage from our mistakes, from my glimpse into the other world, perhaps we weren’t beyond hope.
  

  
I bit into the chicken wings after a long, grueling day, and smiled to myself as the sun rose. My grandfather was right, they were damn good.
