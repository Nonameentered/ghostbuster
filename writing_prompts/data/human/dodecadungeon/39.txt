“Why are you sniffing the room?”
  

  
“I need the whole room to smell like incense,” I replied.
  

  
Sheryl crinkled her nose, “I think it’s working. But why?”
  

  
“My ability only works in areas where there’s incense,” I answered.
  

  
Sheryl frowned, “Then you should have bought more burners.”
  

  
I shook my head, “While yes, that would be ideal, I don’t want them to know how much of the area is affected.”
  

  
Sheryl sighed, “But can’t he smell it?”
  

  
“Smell again,” I suggested.
  

  
Sheryl sniffed, and then blinked, “That’s strange…”
  

  
I smiled, “It doesn’t smell like incense, it’s scented. A burner would give away that it’s incense, but not this time.”
  

  
Sheryl grinned, “That’s actually clever! But what if he doesn’t show up on time?”
  

  
“He’s known for being punctual, besides, he has no reason to be otherwise. How would he know of my plan?”
  

  
“Fair, good luck to you, then.”
  

  
“Thanks, I’ll need it.”
