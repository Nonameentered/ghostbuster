Prince Wylan couldn’t stop thinking about the masked ballgoer who he danced with that night. His movements were so graceful, his smile so charming and mischievous, and he made Wylan feel more alive and excited than he had in a while.
  

  
Everything in the castle was dull and boring. He was confined within its walls where people droned on about politics and other nonsense. A bunch of backstabbing games of social deception and manipulation, none of which he wanted to be a part of.
  

  
He partied to forget about all that, but even the parties were beginning to feel lackluster. Thank goodness for that masked man. It was unfortunate, however, that the masked man happened to be a thief. He stole heirlooms and handled the family jewels, the prince blushed at the double entendre.
  

  
Yes, he took more than just treasure. As cliche as it sounded, he had stolen Wylan’s heart. He knew so very little about this thief and yet his heart raced at the very thought of him. He would have to find him. He would put out a bounty for him and continue to hold masquerades, hoping that one or the other would lure him back. He just hoped the thief felt the same.
