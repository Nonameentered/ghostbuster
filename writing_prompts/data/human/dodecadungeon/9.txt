“Do you know who I am?”
  

  
Toby looked up to see a shaky man holding a gun out at him. It was hard to see specific features, as he had just turned the lights out in the firm, but from his voice Toby could tell the man was angry and frightened. He sighed, “Perhaps a little light would help with that, may I take out my lighter?”
  

  
There was a momentary pause, “F-fine, but no funny business.”
  

  
Toby nodded, taking out a lighter and lighting a cigar, “Want one?”
  

  
“I didn’t say you could smoke.”
  

  
“Apologies, I thought it was implied with the lighter and all.”
  

  
“Let me ask again, do you know who I am?”
  

  
“Yeah… you’re that nervous feller who came to me about a case.”
  

  
“And…”
  

  
“I refused, the case couldn’t be won.”
  

  
“I rotted in jail for ten years for a crime I didn’t commit! You were my last chance! They said if anyone could solve the case it was you, and you refused! You even told me you knew I was innocent!”
  

  
“I said that to give you hope, not despair.”
  

  
“No, it was because you knew what justice was and walked away from it because it would tarnish your perfect record. You showed me what really mattered to you that day.”
  

  
“Look, I can’t undo the past, but I can give you whatever you need to get back on your feet. It can be a difficult adjustment, to leave prison. I have some resources that can help, they’re expensive, but you won’t have to worry about cost, I’ll cover it all.”
  

  
“Look at you! I am standing here, with a gun in my hand, calling you out for your lies, and you have the audacity to do nothing but offer my consolation prizes! You disgust me!”
  

  
“Please, calm down. Let’s just talk this out, there’s no need to get violent.”
  

  
“Give me one reason I shouldn’t kill you right now!”
  

  
“Well, I’d like to bring forth my first piece of evidenc-”
  

  
Blam! The man let the shot fire, shaking even more, “You were a lawyer until the very end, Toby. If you had just talked to me like a human being, then maybe I would have left you live, but you had lost your humanity a long time ago.”
