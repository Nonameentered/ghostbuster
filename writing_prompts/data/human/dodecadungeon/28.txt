No apology necessary, takes as much of a break as you need. I hope you're doing better the break has helped your mental health. Here's the next part! - 

“Ah, Acrasia, it’s been too long since you’ve stepped foot in the College of the Arcane,” smiled the curator.

Acrasia bowed to the woman, “Indeed it has. It is good to see you again, curator Serenity.”

Serenity beamed, “It is good to see you too, princess. What brings you to the College of the Arcane today?”

“A few things. First, I would like to borrow some tomes regarding runes and ether infused items,” Acrasia listed.

Serenity nodded, “A curious inquiry, but such tomes can indeed be taken into your possession for a time.”

“Thank you, Serenity. Would it also be possible to acquire some ether?” Acrasia asked. “I have the funds to cover the cost, I know how valuable it is.”

Serenity blinked, “Oh… a curious desire. I thought that you had forgone your studies of the arcane.”

Acrasia sighed, “I had. Anastasia Wells’ false promises broke my trust in the arcane community, along with the dangers of synthetic ether. But recently I have found myself drifting, trying to find purpose.”

“It can be difficult to discover where one belongs, but I am happy to help you find your place. Use ether in moderation, however. It is potent magic, and while not as dangerous as synthetic, can change the body in unfortunate ways.”

“I will keep that in mind.”

“It is truly good to have you back in these halls. I remember how you spent so much time in the archives, reading through any tome you could get your hands on. You’re such an avid reader, Acrasia. That is something that is rare, even amongst scholars. You truly love knowledge. I admire the purity in that.”

“I do not know if I deserve such praise, but it is good to be back.”

“I disagree, you are a true scholar, Acrasia. I know that people like Anastasia in the arcane community can be discouraging, but it needs people like you to remind people what being an arcanist is supposed to be.”

Acrasia sighed, fighting back tears, “I-... I don’t know what to say.”

Serenity smiled and patted Acasia’s shoulder, “The truth needs no response. I only wish more people would see it so you could know how valuable you and your idealistic love of knowledge is.”

“So you don’t think such ideals are foolish?” inquired Acrasia.

Serenity shook her head, “Not at all. I think they’re beautiful.”

Acrasia smiled, “Thank you, Serenity. I needed to hear that.”

Serenity nodded, leading Acrasia to one of the many aisles within the arcane archives, searching through them and pulling out various tomes before handing them to Acrasia, “Here you are. These should contain all of the information you requested.”

Acrasia took them into her hands with reverence, “Thank you. For the arcane archives however, I do not mean to sound disappointed, but this is less knowledge on these subjects than I expected to find.”

Serenity sighed, “Yes, it is unfortunate. Runic magic is ancient, and nearly lost to time. As for infused items, they are still very much a mystery to the arcane community. Though perhaps, you could be the one to change that.”

Acrasia chuckled, “I appreciate the confidence, Serenity, though there are much more talented arcanists than I for such matters.”

Serenity shrugged, “Suit yourself, but your own limits might surprise you.”

Acacia smiled, “I hope they do.”

Serenity lead Acrasia to a large metal door, taking out a small pouch of ether and letting it pool in her hand. The substance was strange, it flowed like a liquid, looked like mist, glowed like flame, and could be molded like clay. It defied all the rules of matter, for it was something other than matter. It was magic.

The curator muttered an incantation under her breath and began to shape the ether in her hands. It pulsed a bluish-purple color, the pusling growing louder and more frequent as Serenity continued to chant the incantations. As she finished the last syllable she clasped her hands together, causing the pool of ether to burst, glowing particles of magic dispersing and swarming toward the door. The curator moved her hands, continuing to control the ether as it seeped into the metal, clicks sounding from within before Serenity dropped her hands, finished with the spell, and opened the door.

Acrasia gasped, looking at Serenity and the door with wide-eyed amazement, “That was incredible…”

Serenity smiled, “Magic sure is a wondrous thing. Now come, follow me.” She led Acrasia into the vault, down a long corridor filled with shelves upon shelves of ether vials, all glowing faintly in the darkness.

Acrasia gawked at the vials, following Serenity down the hall, “There’s so many, and they’re all unique…”

Serenity nodded, “In concept, ether is rather simple. It’s magic taken form. The magic in the world always stays the same. Once it is used, it returns to the Source and then rekindles at a coalescing zone. It is not unlike water. After it evaporates, it returns to the sky, only to fall once more. Just as every snowflake is unique, so is every sphere of ether.”

Acrasia grinned, “It’s beautiful, poetic even.”

“It truly is,” Serenity gestured to the rows of vials, “Chose one.”

Acrasia blinked, “Any vial?”

Serenity chuckled, “It can be overwhelming, but the choice must be yours. Which one speaks to you?”

Acrasia moved through the rows, analyzing each one in turn, searching for one that called to her. There was so much ether. Some as colorful as the rainbow, with vibrant colors, showing off their majesty. Others were a single solid color, humming beautiful pure melodies that spoke to something deeper than the ear. They all sang, but none of them called to her. Except one.

It’s melody was soft, but complex. It had a shyness to it in the way it pulsed, as if it did not know its true strength. It’s music was almost hidden by the other melodies around it, but Acrasia heard it as if none of the other ether vials were around. It was speaking to something deep within her. She knew what it was like to feel bashful, to yearn to be something more. To have a powerful melody within but so few chances to let it spread its wings. She smiled at to the vial, “I’ve made my choice.”
