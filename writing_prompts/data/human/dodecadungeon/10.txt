I had never seen a girl so nervous as Aria.
  

  
She entered my shop, eyes darting around like a fearful critter, clutching her purse tight. I smiled as amiably as I could, trying to make the environment as low-stress as I could. She took another moment to consider what to do next before entering.
  

  
I gestured for her to take a seat, which, considering there were multiple chairs available, had a rather difficult time picking a seat. After she did, she fidgeted on it consistently, evening changing seats at one point. I asked her why she had come and she looked around once more before answering, speaking in a whisper, “I… I want to know how I die.”
  

  
I blinked, confused by the request. She was young, with her whole life ahead of her, surely she would have a happier request. I tried to dissuade her, offering to tell her what job she would get or who she would fall in love with, but she was set on learning about her death. I sighed but reluctantly entered my divining trance, internally hoping that she lived a long life and died happy, despite the fear this girl had.
  

  
I was wrong. She somehow had a premonition about her death, and it was soon. I wanted to lie, to offer some comfort, but my shock and horror betrayed the truth. The girl sighed, resigned to her fate, “It’s soon, isn’t it?”
  

  
I nodded solemnly, “The future isn’t set in stone… there’s still a chance…”
  

  
She shook her head, “I expected this… I just, I had to make sure.”
  

  
I frowned, “How did you expect this.”
  

  
She smiled and leaned close, whispering to me, “I think I have your gift.”
  

  
My eyes widened, “You saw the future?”
  

  
She nodded, “A few times, small things you know. At first, I thought I was crazy, or they were just coincidences or something… but then I saw my death… and well, I had to check, because if it is that soon, I have to make a few changes to how I live my life, considering I don’t have much time.”
  

  
I smiled. Her posture was no longer fidgety and reserved, she owned the space of the chair, sitting confidently, eyes looking straight ahead. She raised an eyebrow at me, “What is it?”
  

  
I shook my head, “Nothing. You have a gift, that is rare. Please, come visit whenever you like, and have a good rest of your life.”
  

  
She grinned, “Thanks!” She waved, heading out.
  

  
I had never seen a girl so confident as Aria.
