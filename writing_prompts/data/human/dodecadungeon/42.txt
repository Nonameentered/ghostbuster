“I finally did it,” I smiled.
  

  
“Did what?” Geoffrey asked.
  

  
I grin, “Lucid dreamed! I was flying and everything!”
  

  
Geoffrey gasped, “Wow! How was it?”
  

  
“Fantastic! Though….” I frown.
  

  
Geoffrey raised an eyebrow, “What’s wrong?”
  

  
I sigh, leaning forward, “Do you know how you normally don’t have any agency in your dreams? I mean, it feels like you, and what you’d do in that situation even, but it’s not you?”
  

  
“I’m only kind of following.”
  

  
“Well… I think that’s because we’re not in control of our own bodies.”
  

  
“I don’t understand.”
  

  
“Sometimes, when you lucid dream, you see sleep paralysis demons afterward. I thought they were just a trick of REM or something, but I could feel the presence of that thing. It wanted control back.”
  

  
“You’re talking crazy, you know that right?”
  

  
“I know it sounds insane but you have to believe me. I know what I saw and I know what I felt. These dream demons normally control us in our dreams at night. They steal our memories and distort them into their own dream realities. Some just want to enjoy the different scenarios that are brought about by our memories, but others, others feed on bad memories. Nightmares.”
  

  
“Prove it.”
  

  
“I just did! Fine, I understand this is just an explanation for what happens, not the answer, but look, you know that feeling of dissociation when you first wake up?”
  

  
“Yeah.”
  

  
“Well, that feeling is you getting your body back.”
  

  
“I… I’m actually starting to get on board with this, which worries me. What are the implications of this?”
  

  
“I don’t know, our lives don’t really change much, but I want to see my dream demon again. I want to talk to them.”
  

  
“Are you crazy?”
  

  
“Maybe, but I have to learn more.”
