“Why did you break that mirror?” Dmitri asked.
  

  
“I need more bad luck,” I answered, stomping on cracks in the sidewalk.
  

  
Dmitri blinked, “That doesn’t seem like a very good idea…”
  

  
I shook my head, “Normally, it wouldn’t be. But there’s a balance. I can only use good luck for how much bad luck I’ve had, and I need to be really lucky.”
  

  
Dmitri nodded, “Oh… no wonder you couldn’t just use your powers to rake in dough at casinos. Hey, if it’s bad luck you want there’s a ladder you can walk under over there.”
  

  
I grinned, “Ah, good catch! Thanks, Dmitri.” I ran circles as I went back and forth under the ladder.
  

  
Dmitri scratched his head, “So, why do you need so much luck?”
  

  
I sighed, “I’m nervous…”
  

  
Dmitri blinked, “About what?”
  

  
“I’m going to ask Anne to marry me.”
  

  
“Oh… that’s certainly a big decision. But luck won’t help you.”
  

  
“What do you mean?”
  

  
“It’s not like rolling dice when it comes to love. It’s either there or it isn’t, built by connections and shared affections. Piling on bad luck is only going to mean you’ll have hard times when you live your lives together.”
  

  
“Are you sure? Is there nothing I can do to make sure everything ends up alright?”
  

  
“Do you love her?”
  

  
“Yes, of course.”
  

  
“Then you’ll accept whatever answer she gives. Luck will change nothing.”
  

  
“I… I know you’re right… I’m just terrified.”
  

  
“Love isn’t supposed to be easy, but despite the hardship and effort you have to put in, it’s worth it to see the person you want to share your life with happy.”
  

  
“Thanks, Dmitri. I’m lucky to have you as a friend.”
