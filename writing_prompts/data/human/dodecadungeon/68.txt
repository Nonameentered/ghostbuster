Thanks! I made sure the Nydas and Wylan about each other often! And I'm glad, the royal sibling dynamic was a joy to write! Here's the next part! - 

“We’re here. Do you remember the plan?”

Nydas nodded to the Count beneath his helmet, “infiltrate the castle, find my friends, and be back here before the last bell tolls.”

“Indeed,” the Count responded, “and no later under any circumstances, understood?”

“Understood,” Nydas answered. “See you at the last bell, Veris.”

The Count tipped his hat to the rogue, “good luck, Nydas.”

“Good luck, Veris,” Nydas grinned before opening the carriage to let the Count out, standing watch by the carriage until the attention of the castle guards waned, allowing him to slip away from the carriage.

Nydas hugged the shadows as he raced to the castle. He knew that if his party was captured within the castle, it would likely be underground, though entering underground is difficult and entering through the busy ground floor is a less than ideal scenario. He could enter through one of the more quiet floors above, but doing so still meant he would have to find a way to pass through the busy floor level below. 

The rogue wished he could throw off his guard helmet and let the world see his beautiful face once more, but more specifically, let the prince see that face. And his face was indeed wonderful. Smooth hazel skin, like the sky when dusk graces it, parting with the sun. Piercing amber eyes, like gemstones taken from a dragon’s hoard. Raven black hair, the color of the shadows which he found repose in on many a night. A soft, small nose, vulnerable and guarded like his heart. Facial features which faded in the darkness, handsome yet with a sharp vagueness that only an excellent artist could truly capture.

Fortunately, a plan was available that would allow any dad to both discard his helmet and enter through the ground floor. The guards used a separate restroom to the ball goers, but the two were directly connected. Changing his clothes in the stall, he could slip between restrooms and sneak back to the cellar before anyone of note saw his unlawful face, heading to the dungeon from there.

The dungeon was labyrinthine in its complexity. Though it’s darkness and small spaces made it easy enough for Nydas to avoid detection, the important part then would be to navigate it in time to reach the prisoners before the last bell tolled.

Nydas made haste through the dungeons, the chattering nonsense and clinking glasses coming from the gala above growing more distant. The torches flickered as he ran past them, each footstep struggling to be silent against the echoey halls if they dungeon. His feet deftly stepped around puddles and traps, moving in almost a dance as he snuck through the underground.

He hoped that Count Veris was having more luck than him. He wondered if the prince was at the gala now, probably dancing with various attractive nobles. Nydas wanted to punch these imaginary nobles in the face. They weren’t good enough for the prince, but was he?

Nydas shook those thoughts out of his mind and continued through the maze-like dungeon, pausing in his steps from the sound of conversation in the distance. He slowly inched forward, grasping for more sound to listen to as he neared the source of the noise.

There was a familiarity to the voice. While at first he thought it might have been one of the crown guard he encountered during his espionage, but no, that wasn’t it. It was the voice of Reese.

He heard another voice; Selvin. Nydas smiled, it was his party. Nydas beamed, running up to the cell his party was held in, “Selvin! Reese! Zeris!” 

The three turned to him with wide eyes and surprised expressions, Resse gasped, “Nydas? Is that really you?”

Nydas nodded, “yes, it really is. Damn, it’s so good to see all of you.”

Reese sighed, “you were right, Nydas. It was a set up, we should have listened. We were just so scared about getting caught and-”

Nydas cut her off, “what happened happened. I just got lucky. But the Count and I are working on a plan to get you out and figure out who’s behind all this.”

Selvin raised an eyebrow, “you’re working with the Count? The one who set us up?”

Nydas shook his head, “he didn’t set you up. He was backed into a corner. He tried to make it look like a set-up to warn us… I’m just lucky I saw the signs.”

Zeris chuckled, “relying on you for a plan to work? The Count must have more guts than I’ve given him credit for.”

Selvin glared, “I still don’t like this. Do you really think we can trust the Count after this?”

Nydas shrugged, “he’s been good on his word so far. He’s the only reason I was able to get to you. And I don’t have much other choice.”

Selvin nodded, “I understand. Just be careful, he could be leading you into a trap.”

“Noted,” Nydas responded, “have any of you learned what’s going on while you were kept here?”

Reese sighed, “they’ve mostly been interrogating Zeris. He’s held strong, but I don’t know what they could possibly want to learn from us.”

Nydas turned to Zeris, “what kind of things did they ask you about?”

Zeris clutched his head, “I’m not sure… those aren’t pleasant memories. My mind is hazy when it came to them.”

Nydas gasped, “oh hells, that bad? This doesn’t make any sense… I need you to try and think, Zeris. I know it’s hard, but we need to learn as much of this as we can if we are to figure out who’s behind all this.”

“I agree,” Reese added, “we’ll help him recover those memories.”

“I know you haven’t had as much interaction with Zeris as the enemy, but did either of you learn anything thus far?” asked Nydas.

Selvin shook his head, “not much. They appear to be the real crown guard, though. They took that artifact off our hands as soon as possible. I’m not sure why they’re keeping us here. If I were them I’d have killed us already so we couldn’t get word out about the plot. It’s only because it seems they want more information that they keep us alive. Though I don’t think it’s anything we can provide to them.”

Nydas began putting the pieces together in his mind, cursing, “or they want to use you as bait… dammit all!”

Reese’s expression softened, “Nydas, what’s wrong?”

Nydas heard footsteps racing down the halls, toward their cell, he looked down the hall with anticipation, then back at the party with a sorrowful glance, “I… I’m sorry. They’re coming now. I can’t let them catch me. I don’t have any plan for your escape, and if even if I did, they would know we’re onto them as soon as I broke you out. I’ll come back for all of you, I promise. I wish I could do more right now.”

Reese reached past the bars and patted Nydas’ hand, “we understand. I know you’ll come back for us. Be careful, and be quick.”

Nydas nodded, waving farewell to the group before racing back down the dungeon halls, tears welling in his eyes.
