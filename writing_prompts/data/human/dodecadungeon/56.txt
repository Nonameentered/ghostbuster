Yeah, he's growing up! Here's the next part! - 

Nydas was being tailed, one doesn’t last this long as a thief without knowing when one is being watched or followed.

He frowned, he had been so careful. What had changed? Why had someone noticed him now? He supposed it was bound to happen at some point, but even still, it was unlike him to be careless.

Nydas tried to shake his tail, taking side streets and hugging the shadows, but the tail followed without issue. Nydas picked up his pace, taking more difficult routes which required acrobatic maneuvers and practicing footing. Still, the tail pursued.

The thief cursed, noticing a second tail appear. Then a third. Before he knew it he was surrounded, without anywhere to run. Soon enough there were four of them. He was outnumbered, but not outmatched. At least he hoped.

He stood his ground, drawing his blade. The shadowy figures approached slowly, and then he noticed it, the crown guard insignia. Nydas sighed, he should have known. It was probably after that stunt where he pretended to by Dyson. They knew something was up and looked into it.

Nydas knew if he waited until he was surrounded he would have no chance, so he hurled a dagger at the leg of one of his approachers, causing it to buckle from the pain. The other three instantly burst into a sprint, racing toward him.

He wasted no time, hurling another dagger, but this time his target was ready, and dodged it. Nydas ran at the nearest tail, leaping into a tackle and pinning them to the ground. The other pursuers would be on him soon, so he stabbed his dagger into the target’s clothing to pin them to the ground before turning around to face his two standing opponents.

Nydas swung his blade in a wide arc to create space between him and his opponents before dashing forward in the disarray and swinging his sword at the nearest target’s leg. They yelled in pain, but the other one took advantage of the opening, thrusting their sword forward and piercing his shoulder.

He stumbled back in pain, ready to focus on the one opponent standing until he heard footsteps. Spinning around he saw the target he first wounded with his dagger limp forward, blade drawn. Nydas tried to race over to them. They would be easy to incapacitate since they were already wounded, allowing him to focus just on one opponent once more. But before he could make it to them, he felt his legs stumble.

Nydas crashed against the ground, groaning in pain and disarray, he turned around to see the outstretched leg of the crown guard he had pinned to the ground, which they had used to trip Nydas. The limping guard had almost reached him, and Nydas was an easy target while he was still on the ground.

He scrambled to his feet, but the limping opponent was already on him. They swung their blade which Nydas barely had time to dodge. Nydas examined his surroundings, the unwounded guard was removing the dagger from the pinned one’s clothes, freeing them, and the one he had attacked with his sword was also rising.

Nydas cursed again, it would be four against one soon, not great odds. He stumbled backwards, trying to put an equal distance between all four of his pursuers before drawing a fistful of daggers and hurling them in a flurry all around him. The guards shielded themselves and doubled back, crying out in pain. Nydas flipped over them, landing behind one of the wounded opponents, pushing them down to the floor and pinning them with a fallen dagger. One down.

The other three began to regain their composure, racing toward Nydas once more. Nydas had no more daggers left to use, so he took a deep breath, focused on his surroundings, and adjusted his footing. He could hear every footfall the guards made, every breath they took, even the rustle of their clothing. He knew exactly where they were at any given moment. He was completely in control.

One came hurling at Nydas with his sword, an attack which Nydas had seen coming since before they lifted their sword and raced toward him, easily dodging it. The next made a sweeping attack, which was harder to dodge, but not for one who knew how to flip, leaped over the blade and using the opening to pierce his opponents shoulder, causing them to double back in agony.

The third one now approached, taking an entirely different tactic as they hurled their sword. Nydas could see from their stance that it would be a throw, even though the guard meant for their attack to be unpredictable. He spun out of the way, the sword continuing onward and stabbing the first guard, who was just about ready to make another attack. They gasped from pain and surprise, keeling over.

Two down, two to go. The wounded one, now with both a wounded leg and shoulder, was not much of a threat. Nydas easily knocked them to the ground and pinned them with another fallen dagger, dodging a swing from the only remaining guard as he did so. Three down, one to go.

Nydas blocked an incoming attack with his own blade, then countered with an attack of his own. The two parried and lunged, swung and block, charged and retreated. Nydas was no match when it came to purely blade against blade combat, and to make matters worse, he was fatigued from defeating the previous three.

Fortunately, Nydas didn’t need to win, he just needed to escape. Tucking into a roll, Nydas picked up as many of his fallen daggers as he could, dodging attacks from his opponent as he doubled back and drew a sack from his pouch, throwing it on the ground. As it burst against the floor, smoke surrounded the pair, giving Nydas room to escape. He disappeared into the darkness, hugging into the shadows before the smoke even cleared.

He waited for a time to make sure he was in the clear before the guards retreated. Once he was safe, he ripped a piece of cloth from his shirt and fashioned a bandage for his wounded shoulder, wincing from the pain as he wrapped it around the wound.

Nydas sighed, he didn’t envy having to explain this to the Count or Wylan, hoping that he could hide it with a clean shirt. He scratched his head, curious to how the guard had found him. They were not in their usual armor, but wore much lighter clothing, suitable for stealth. They had come prepared and with a plan. But how? How much of an advance did they have on him for such preparations?

He let the thoughts linger as he kept to the shadows, humming to himself as he headed back to the manor, entering through the window so the Count wouldn't notice the injury he sustained from the guard.
