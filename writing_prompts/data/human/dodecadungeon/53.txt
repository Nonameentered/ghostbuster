I definitely will keep writing! You're about to see the answer to part of the that prediction! Here's the next part! - 

“Acrasia! Let me in!” Wylan yelled, pounding on her door.

“Go away!” shouted Acrasia from within her room.

Wylan groaned, “come on, Acrasia. Can we at least talk about this?”

“What is there to talk about? I pushed her too far and ruined everything, all thanks to you and the thief,” she replied.

Wylan grit his teeth, “don’t call him that!”

“Well isn’t that what he is? A thief?”

“Acrasia, please, leave him out of this!”

“Why? Because he is involved in this. You trust him more than me, and you don’t even know him!”

“But I do, he’s opened himself to me, and that’s worth something.”

“I don’t care, it doesn’t matter now. I can’t fathom I actually believed you. Believed that you’d help me win over Diane. After all the time you’ve spent neglecting me, choosing your galas and gallivanting over me, that you’d do anything different this time. I guess it’s my own fault for thinking you’ve changed.”

The prince leaned against the door, sighing, “you’re right. I’ve been a bad brother, but my intention was never to hurt you.”

Wylan could hear the emotion in Acrasia’s voice as she spoke, “I needed you, Wylan. I needed you but you never came. So I turned to my books, because that’s all I had. You were always in the spotlight, and I was always in the darkness.”

His voice caught in his throat, “Acrasia… I never…”

Acrasia cackled, “you never knew? You never knew? Well, wake up, Wylan! Wake up! I’ve been calling for you for so long, and now you finally listen. Well it’s too late!”

Wylan opened his mouth to speak, but no words emerged. He knew no apology was enough, no words were enough. He stood there, unsure of what action to take, what he could possibly do to make things right, but nothing came to mind.

He whispered “I’m sorry” to the door, for what little it was worth. He didn’t want to leave her, not again, but he couldn’t make a change by just waiting there. To make things right, Wylan would have to go beyond words.

Wylan reluctantly pulled himself away from her door, eyes wet with emotion. He raced down the hall, vision blurry from the tears, mind elsewhere. Without noticing where he was going, he bumped right into Rene.

Rene blinked, “your Highness, are you alright?”

Wylan teetered, attempting to regain his balanced, “I’m sorry sir, I was-”

Rene cut him off, “there’s no need to apologize, milord. But you appear in distress, are you alright?”

Wylan sighed, “I’m fine.”

Rene frowned, “I doubt that, your Highness. But if you don’t wish to take it up with me we have services for such-”

Wylan paused, “services… you said I had authority over the crown guard, correct?”

Rene nodded, “yes, you do.”

“Good, does that include summons?” Wylan inquired.

“Of course!” responded Rene. “Any member of the royal family can summon almost any staff member within the castle.”

“Great. Does that include the captain of the guard?” Wylan asked.

“It does, but she is busy at the moment,” answered Rene.

Wylan raised an eyebrow, “with what?”

Rene shrugged, “I don’t know, sir. I can look into it if you’d like. And, as I mentioned earlier, this would be much easier if I was given authority privileges.”

Wylan shook his head, “that won’t be necessary. Oh, and I almost forgot. Could you get a messenger to deliver this to the tutor?” He handed Rene an sealed envelope written in his own hand.

Rene grinned, “ah, it shall be done.”

Wylan blinked, remembering another task to complete, “oh, and we have a new guard joining the forces, Sydan. He should be arriving for duty later today. Please put his name in the system.”

Rene raised an eyebrow, “this is… unusual, but I'll put the name in the system.”

“Thank you,” Wylan wiped the dampness from his eyes, trying to figure out what move to make next considering Diane’s unavailability, “Rene, could you compile a list of everyone within the castle who is a commoner.”

Rene gulped, “sir? This is highly irregular, that information is personal and-”

“I don’t care. Do it,” Wylan commanded, anger rising in his voice.

Rene sighed and nodded, “it shall be done, your Highness.”

“Good,” Wylan scoffed, walking off.
