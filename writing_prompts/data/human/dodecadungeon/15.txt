George Washington, Julius Caesar, and Louis XIV. These are some of the figures in history that come to mind in regards to come of the most influential leader. All up there with Carrie Reese.
  

  
Carrie Reese wasn’t just a leader, she was an explorer, like Magellan or Louis and Clark. She was a trailblazer like the Wright Brothers and Alexander Gram Bell, a figure of hope.
  

  
The apocalypse is dangerous, but only in its desperation. It is a place where if you aren’t fierce friends with someone, then they are your mortal enemy. Resources are scarce and quickly fading. None of the ground is fertile, not any that they discovered, anyway. Carrie refused to believe that all there was to life was scarcity and death. She believed they could start a real civilization in the apocalypse, to rebuild. The earth had suffered many extinction-level events before after all, and each time life returned. This time would be no different, as long as there was hope.
  

  
It took her years, and in those years she had many adventurers. She became a figure of legend, like John Henry or Rosy the Riveter. She was whispered amongst all circles. Some believed her mad, others joined her cause.
  

  
She died before they found the promised land, a place where land was fertile, a place of rebuilding. Though her death was noble, staying behind to provide a distraction for her followers, fending off as many raiders as she could, taking down a dozen of them before they finally defeated her.
  

  
Though she is gone, she is never forgotten. A statue of her stands in the new capital, the birthplace of post-apocalyptic civilization. A haven where no one has to struggle to survive, where they can work together and prosper. A safe place, and it is all possible because of Carrie Reese.
