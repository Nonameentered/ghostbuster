Hann let the eye droplets plunge into his pitch-black eyes, easing the pain left by the blue scar on them. Taking out his contacts and inserted them into both eyes, hiding his void irises with a facsimile of red eyes. He puts on a longsleeved turtleneck to cover up as much of his changing skin tone as possible, taking out a tablet device to check his oxygen and water levels before hiding the oxygen and hydrogen monoxide tubes within his clothes, taking a deep breath of pure oxygen before stepping out. 
  

  
He doesn’t know why he was risking going out to this event, he would be safe in the lab, where all his strange and eccentric needs would be met, his intelligence and skills would be of use, and no one would think he was strange. But he has to see her.
  

  
Hann had first heard Willow when one of the lab scientists had put on the radio during work. Her voice was angelic. He didn’t know her, only by her voice, but her song seemed to be speaking to him. To that fishbowl soul wondering what life is like outside the water, to that wanderlust quashed by a lifestyle that he never wanted. To the struggling truth covered up beneath a blanket lie. All the things he couldn’t put into words, she had done for him in song. He listened to every song, every album, every variation, her words providing sustenance to the starved part of his soul.
  

  
So here he was, hiding in the backseat of a transport, clutching onto the seat tight and obscuring himself in the shadows, waiting in excited dreadful anticipation for what he was about to do. He was going to see Willow, really see her. Hann held the ticket to Willow’s performance with reverence. He had so many things he wanted to say, but could not put them in words as Willow had done in song. He wanted to let her know that her songs moved him to do something he had never done before, to fly from the safety of the nest to hear her sing. She had given him wings.
  

  
Arriving hours early so he could get to his seat before many people had arrived, he manages to avoid as much contact and interaction as he could. He takes a seat in the front, his dry throat burning, swallowing aimlessly from nervousness, his many anxious ticks acting up as he stands waiting and waiting. His eyes want to water from the stage lights, but his body was short on water to spare.
  

  
Finally, she appears on the stage. The angel herself, Willow. Hann nearly faints, he nearly cries, and he nearly screams. And yet he does nothing, frozen in silence as he gazes up at her, transfixed by her voice as she sings. He mutters the lyrics to her songs under his breath as she sings, smiling brightly as he relishes every note.
  

  
He can’t believe this moment is truly happening. Hearing Willow from a few feet away was so much more full and beautiful than the sounds the radio could provide. He isn’t hearing a facsimile, but her true voice, reaching through his ears and into his soul, burrowing there and warming it with an angelic brilliance.
  

  
She is beautiful. Radiating an aura of confidence, she strides and dances across the stage, her voice filling the space and claiming it as hers. Claiming his heart as hers. Her piercing red eyes ignite with a passion, and her curly black hair bounces as she strides across the stage, dancing with her. Her tail swishes and sashays back and forth alluringly, full of life and joy. Every step she makes seems a model’s pose, Hann wishes he could take a picture of her every motion, just to confirm that each one would be a masterpiece.
  

  
After the show, he sits for a few moments in reverie, unable to believe what he had witnessed was real, and not a dream. He had actually done it, all because of her inspiration. But her inspiration did not stop there. He feels as if he could do anything with those lyrics in his heart. He races backstage, hoping to intercept her. He cares not if it was against the rules, he has to see her. He has to tell her how much her music means to him.
  

  
Finally, he sees her. Their eyes meet, Hann’s breath catches in his throat, trying to find the words to say. But before he could speak a word, the stage security pulls him away. A gasp emerges from his mouth, and Willow’s face softens. Hann sighs, he had missed his chance, never to see Willow again.
  

  
As he waits in the stage jail, he hears footsteps emerging. There is a rhythm to them, causing Hann to perk up. He must be dreaming, it couldn’t be, and yet, as he looks up, he sees her: Willow. She smiles softly, leaning against the bars, “sorry about the incarceration. You’re free to go now.” She says with a wink, opening the door with a sparkly key, her every motion perfect as she twists the key within the rusting lock.
  

  
Hann stares at her, breathless, “why?”
  

  
Willow grins, “because I heard that gasp before. It is a gasp of true suffering. Of incompleted action. I felt that gasp before. I had to know what was so important to you.”
  

  
Hann takes a deep breath, then tells her his story. He spares out no detail, telling her how he discovered her music, speaking from his heart as he explains how much her music means to him, what it lead him to do, and how much of a privilege it was to see and hear her perform. 
  

  
Willow takes a moment to digest his story, and smiles, offering her hand to him, “I don’t believe I’ve met anyone like you, Hann. You are a delicate soul, the one I didn’t know I was speaking to through my music. I would very much like to get to know you better. You speak from your heart, creating poetry of the soul. It rivals my own music, and I’d very much like to hear more of it.”
  

  
Hann could do little else but nod, too happy and bashful to do much else. His life was no longer confined to the lab, no longer confined to fear, all because of her.
