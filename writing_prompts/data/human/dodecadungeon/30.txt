I leaped off the building, switching my kinetic energy to potential, halting my increase in momentum. I floated downward, landing softly against the ground, feeling the kinetic energy build within me. A sound, a turn, a blade. I wasn’t alone.
  

  
The other kinetic ran towards me, except he didn’t run. He was putting in all the effort of running, without the distance, keeping the built-up energy stored within him which he released as he threw the blade.
  

  
It was too late to dodge. I took a deep breath and felt the hum of the air as the blade approached me, attempting to steal the kinetic energy from the projectile. It didn’t work completely, the blade still lodged itself within me, but not enough to be lethal. I groaned, using my built-up energy to dash at him, increasing my momentum dramatically within only a few milliseconds.
  

  
I tackled him to the ground and slowed our fall as we did, tacking back the lost momentum. I then hurled the blade at him. Normally, from such a short distance it would be a harmless attack, but I could get the blade to accelerate dramatically, making it not only deadly but incredibly hard to dodge.
  

  
The man screamed, now pinned to the ground by the blade. I grit my teeth, “Don’t try that again.” Before standing up, brushing myself off, and continuing on my way.
