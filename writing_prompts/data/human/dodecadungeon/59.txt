Thanks! And indeed he is, lol. Here's the next part! - 

In years prior, Wylan barely stepped foot in a library once every few months. Though, by some miracle, he found himself in the royal library twice in one week.

Just as Nydas had asked, he decided to look into ether. The library’s shelves were dizzying and confusing, a labyrinth of knowledge. Though eventually, he was able to find tomes on the topic of ether, the number of which left him equally baffled.

Fortunately, he did not have to find the answer alone, for his sister, who lived in the library as much as she did in her own room, was with him. She was invigorated the moment they walked in, gawking at the rows upon rows of books and getting distracted by them. Though now, she could focus that attention toward the ether tomes.

Acrasia smiled, “aren’t you glad you brought me along, brother? To think you thought you could navigate all those tomes without my expert assistance.”

Wylan shrugged, “I suppose not, though you were no help finding this section of the library.”

Acrasia groaned, “oh hush, that’s not my job. There are tons of other books I could be reading right now.”

Wylan chuckled, “whatever. Now, he asked us to specifically look into ether infused items, do any of these books look like they might cover that subject?”

Acrasia hummed in thought, “I’ll start with the Ether: A Comprehensive Anaylsis. Might have something about its various properties including infusion. You can start with… actually, I saw a book earlier in the Myths and Legends section about legendary items. I’d start with that. I don’t think you could handle these dense academic tomes.”

“Hey!” Wylan exclaimed, sighing, “fine, you’re right. Where did you say that book was again?”

Acrasia rolled her eyes, “Myths and Legends, two rows down, aisle 30B.”

Wylan nodded, “okay, I think I got it, I’ll be right back!”

After returning twice to ask Acrasia to repeat the instructions, Wylan finally found the tome, sitting beside his sister at a study table to dive into the dense world of ether. 

Wylan came to the conclusion that Acrasia was right, the legendary items book was rather interesting. There were epic stories surrounding each mythic item, and the abilities they were fabled to have were quite awe-inspiring. Much more interesting than anything an academic tome might have to offer.

It was difficult to tell how much truth there was to each legend, however, as well as if the item even got its power from ether. If he got so little information out of his tome thus far, he wondered how long this research was going to take. He would do it of course, for Nydas. But he didn’t have to enjoy it.

Acrasia on the other hand, was vehemently consuming her tome like it was a royal feast. She made quick work of the pages, flipping though them with incredible haste and consistency. She made gasps of surprise and awe as she read, scribbling down notes and staring at the words with wide eyes. Wylan couldn’t help but chuckle at her reactions to reading, it brought her a degree of joy which he did not understand.

Wylan tried to take notes as well, though he doubted they were very good. Though his reading was fortunately interrupted by a gasp from Acrasia, “oh wow, I didn’t know ether could be addictive.”

The prince raised an eyebrow, “what does that have to do with infusions?”

Acrasia shrugged, “perhaps nothing. But it’s interesting, isn’t it? When a mage that casts using ether as a resource uses it frequently enough, they develop a reliance on it. When they’re body doesn’t get ether at regular intervals they will get ether-starved. They’ll pale, have trouble sleeping, start twitching, lose appetite-“

“You don’t need to go into detail,” interrupted Wylan. “I get your point, ether is dangerous stuff.”

Acrasia nodded, “yeah, good thing I’m not a mage. I’d imagine ether isn’t cheap to come buy, most mages are rich not just because of the extensive study, but because they need regular ether. Just think, those in power could manipulate and control mages by controlling the flow of ether. Cut off sales… mages begin to go into withdrawal.”

Wylan winced, “gosh, that’s horrifying!”

Acrasia sighed, “yeah, scary stuff. Did you find anything interesting in your book?”

Wylan frowned, “you’re just going to brush past everything you just said?”

Acrasia shrugged, “I mean, it’s awful, but its just a hypothetical. Besides, can’t change how the world is. For better or for worse, ether is a part of it. With all its benefits and downsides, ain’t that right?”

Wylan nodded, “I suppose.”

Acrasia patted his shoulder, “relax, we’ll figure this out, alright? Now, did you find anything in that legends book?”

Wylan scratched his head, “not much. It’s hard to tell if any of these are real or if they used ether.”

Acrasia smirked, “oh, my book explains how you can tell. Does the object glow? It should glow, that means it is infused.”

Wylan grinned, “yeah, I believe some of them did glow.”

Acrasia smiled, “perfect. Now, they should stay at the same level of power. That means they couldn’t do massive things once just semi-powerful things over time. Like etherborns rather than mages.”

Wylan flipped through his book, “that narrows it down to a few. Wait, is that the artifact that Nydas stole?”

Acrasia blinked, “huh… I think it is. The Scepter of Ruling, said to force those around you to obey. What was Nydas doing with such a thing?”

Wylan shrugged, “not sure, he probably just wanted to sell it.”

“Or did he?” Acrasia questioned, “for all we know he could be part of this conspiracy too.”

Wylan shook his head, “no, not possible. I told you not to think like that.”

Acrasia sighed, “but we have to admit it’s a possibility.”

“Acrasia, enough!” Wylan ordered, flipping through his book, “the Scepter’s whereabouts before the castle had it were in the hands of… Bethanla?”

Acrasia raised an eyebrow, “what’s wrong?”

Wylan scratched his head, “well… Bethanla is the country that we’re having a military dispute with, the one taking so much of father’s time.”

Acrasia smirked, “when did you become so politically savvy?”

Wylan smiled, “all thanks to Rene, apparently. Now let’s keep reading, there may be more to uncover yet.”

Acrasia nodded and the pair dived back into their tomes, eager to uncover more secrets.
