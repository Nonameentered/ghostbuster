Thanks! The conflict helps keep things moving forward! Here's the next part! - 

“Wait… you’re into a criminal?” questioned Acrasia

Wylan winced, “I um… suppose I am…”

Acrasia sighed, “and you don’t see why this is a problem?”

Wylan shrugged, “I mean, I know it isn’t the most practical relationship, but he makes me happy, and something tells me he’s not stealing because he’s evil or anything. It’s just an occupation, a way to make ends meet.”

“And do you know that for sure?” asked Acrasia.

Wylan shook his head, “I don’t, but I’ll have a chance to find out soon.”

Acrasia groaned, “where you’re meeting him alone in a spooky private room. As annoying as you are, I’d rather not have this be our last conversation.”

“I chose the location, Acrasia. It’s safe.”

“Safe from the crown guard, not him.”

“Acrasia, I’ve supported you in your endeavor, can’t you support me in mine?”

“I really want to, Wylan, but this is more complicated than that. You could be in serious danger, and if anyone in the noble court found out you were courting a criminal, that could seriously hurt your reputation.”

“Bah, who cares?”

“You should care, you’re going to be King.”

“You too? I thought you didn’t care about all that.”

“I don’t, but I’m not going to inherit the throne. Like it or not these decisions matter, and the country needs someone they can trust, not someone who can be seduced by criminals and actively supports them.”

“No one will find out, and I think he can be useful to us.”

“Do you even know that Nydas is his real name?“ Acrasia asked.

Wylan shook his head, “I don’t know for sure, but I can feel that it is. He looks like a Nydas, if that makes sense.”

“Why do you think he’ll be useful, exactly?” inquired Acrasia.

“He has skillsets we don’t. We’re no good at sneaking or spying or espionage, he is. We’ll need those abilities to uncover this conspiracy.”

“And what will he get in return for this work?” questioned his sister.

Wylan scratched his head, “Money? I haven’t quite figured out that part yet.”

Acrasia rolled her eyes, “Wylan, if others find out we’re extorting funds…”

Wylan winced, “I know, I know, I’ll figure something out.”

“I’m coming with you,” Acrasia announced.

Wylan blinked, “what?”

“I don’t want you getting hurt or getting in trouble, since you clearly are going into this extremely blind, you’ll need backup,” Acrasia said.

Wylan sighed, “those are fair points, but what if another person there scares him off?”

“Then he was never trustworthy to begin with,” responded Acrasia. “I’ll keep a distance, I just need to hear what’s going on, keep watch and all. But I’m coming with you, that’s non-negociable, just like the dress.”

Wylan groaned, “fine, just… be careful, alright?”

Acrasia chuckled, “it’s you who needs to be careful, brother. Now what makes Nydas so special, anyway?”

Wylan smiled, “so many things. He’s so graceful, the way he moves and dances is hypnotic. He’s so charming, his smile could melt a frosty hear, his words could placate a raging berserker. He’s kind too, I can see it in his eyes. And his eyes… hells, they’re something else. When I gaze into those amber eyes it’s like his whole soul is revealed to me, and it’s beautiful. He’s something special.”

Acrasia smirked, “I’ll be damned, you looked like you were about to swoon. I thought you normally did the sweeping-off-the-feet.”

Wylan laughed, “not this time, and it’s wonderfully refreshing.”

Acrasia nodded, “it really is.”

Wylan grinned, “and what about you, Acrasia. How was your evening with Diane?”

“Well, I already told you most of it,” answered Acrasia. “We spent all evening talking about books and other shared interests. I could listen to her talk for hours about even the most mundane things and never get bored. She does these cute little hand gestures when she talks, and the pauses never felt awkward, I don’t mind silence with her. It gives me time to gaze at her, taking in her beauty.”

Wylan beamed, “that’s wonderful! See? The gala wasn’t so bad!”

Acrasia shrugged, “I suppose it wasn’t. But remember, I’ll need you to help pick out what I’m going to wear for our next meeting.”

“You can count on my help. Did you learn anything on the conspiracy front?” asked Wylan.

Acrasia tilter her head, “sort of. It seems like the King’s illness is a lot worse than everyone thought. They are trying to keep it under wraps to the public, but none of the doctors have been able to help him as much as they should.”

Wylan sighed, “that isn’t good. We’re on a terribly short clock to figure this all out.”

Acrasia nodded, “indeed. There are rumors that there’s something more to it than just illness, but no one is sure, and no one is brave enough to say they think it’s something else aloud, like someone involved in the conspiracy might hear them.”

Wylan cursed, “damn! Well, this confirms that it’s an inside job, at least.”

“Agreed,” Acrasia continued, “though, there was a similar case to the King’s a few months ago. Do you remember Yevon?”

Wylan scratched his head, “Yevon… Yevon… oh! Was he the one who was supposed to tutor me before he died and was replaced by Rene?”

“Yes, that’s the one,” Acrasia confirmed, “I’m not sure if there’s a connection. Yevon isn’t much of a target, not like the King. I don’t see what anyone would gain from killing him. It’s worth looking into, however.”

Wylan sighed, “well, that’s something at least. It’s so strange…”

“We can definitely agree on that. What about you, learn anything?” inquired Acrasia.

“I have collected quite a bit of notes,” Wylan explained, “but it’s all political jargon. I’m going to meet with Rene today and try to see if he can help explain some of it to me. Perhaps it will yield something useful.”

Acrasia chuckled, “you think you can actually be in the same room as Rene long enough to learn something?”

Wylan shrugged, “sacrifices must be made if this is to work. Rene, as annoying as he is, is a useful asset. Besides, I really should understand politics better if I am to be King soon, though hopefully not too soon.”

Acrasia nodded, “a good point. You’re growing up, brother.”

Wylan smiled, “oh, I wouldn’t give me too much credit. If it wasn’t due to a conspiracy I would still be as immature as ever.”

Acrasia giggled, “perhaps, but still, I’m proud of you.”

Wylan grinned, “thank, sis. I’ll let you know what I learn during the briefing. Thanks again for coming to the gala.”

Acrasia smiled, “thanks for forcing me to go. See you soon, brother.”

Wylan nodded, “see you soon, sister.”
