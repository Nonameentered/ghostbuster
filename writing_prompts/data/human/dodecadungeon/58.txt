Indeed it does. And thank you :) Here's the next part! - 

Nydas found himself once more at the Lief’s Inn, room 245 to be exact. His heartrate quickened as he fiddled with the lock, making as satisfying click as it entered. He couldn’t help but smile even before the door opened, taking a deep breath and opening it, beaming brighter as he saw the handsome prince.

Wylan smiled, “you’ve returned!”

Nydas sighed, “I have. You were right, I’m sorry I doubted you. I have been double crossed recently… and many times before, paranoia is in my nature.”

Wylan shook his head, “you have nothing to apologize for. What I presented to you seemed like insanity.”

Nydas grinned, “but it’s not. I want to help you.”

Wylan beamed, “excellent! Name your price.”

Nydas shook his head, “no price. This will be penance for stealing. Though if you did happen to research on ether…”

Acrasia leaped off the bed, “indeed he did!”

Nydas eeped with surprise, “she’s here?”

Wylan nodded, “yes, she’s much better at explaining the ether stuff than I am.”

“Understood,” Nydas replied, “what did you learn?”

“Well, ”Acrasia explained, “ether infused in items is like when it gets infused with etherborns, it isn’t something that can be made, it has to happen by chance and during its creation. That’s why it is so rare. There are some items where they have attempted to infuse ether into it, but they are often unstable and just as dangerous to the user as they are to others. The item you stole, the Scepter of Rulership, we believe it is infused. Did you know about this? What did you intend to do with it?”

“I had no idea it was infused, all I wanted to do was sell it,” Nydas answered.

Acrasia glared at him, “are you sure?”

Nydas nodded, “look into my eyes, Wylan. See if I’m telling the truth.”

Wylan walked up to Nydas and gazed into his eyes. Nydas felt his cheeks heat as Wylan’s gaze lingered on him. After a moment, Wylan backed away and nodded, “he’s telling the truth, he just wanted to sell it.”

Acrasia sighed, “alright then, we’ll believe that for now.”

Nydas let out a puff of air in relief, “good. If you need further proof, the people who captured my friends have the scepter.”

Wylan gasped, “your friends got captured?”

Nydas nodded, “captured by a group of crown guard who take special orders from someone within the castle with a lot of power. They set us up so they could get the scepter in their hands. They want change, I came up to them disguised as a guard and learned that they’re unhappy with the current regime. When I went to my rumorseeker to confirm your information about the conspiracy, she gave me reason to believe that the conspiracy and the crown guard plot are linked.”

Wylan scratched his head, “wow… this is a lot to take in. If that scepter really has the powers the legends say it does, then whoever has possession of it could easily steal the seat of power. But what are they waiting for?”

Acrasia shrugged, “for your father to die, perhaps?”

Wylan raised an eyebrow, “perhaps… maybe then when I took the throne they could use the rod to manipulate me, use me as a puppet king.”

“Or they could just kill you,” Acrasia suggested.

Nydas grasped Wylan’s hand and squeezed it tight, “I hope not, and if you have reason to believe your life is danger, please, let me know. I want to help keep you safe.”

Wylan blushed, “th-thank you, Nydas. I am not as skilled in situations of danger as you are, but that offer extends both ways.”

Acrasia rolled her eyes, “will you too stop ogling at each other for a moment? We have to figure out who within the castle would want to take the throne and establish their own regime, this is serious stuff.”

Wylan nodded, “agreed. And we have to help Nydas’ friends escape their prison. Maybe they’ve learned something from being on the inside that we can use to take down whoever is plotting all this.”

Nydas’ eyes widened, “really? You’d help my friends?”

Wylan smiled, “of course. We’re on the same side, you’re helping me, it’s only fair. Besides, anyone who’s a friend of yours is a friend of mine.”

Nydas beamed and wrapped his arms around Wylan, “thank you… thank you so much.”

Wylan held Nydas close, “anytime, Nydas.”

Acrasia clapped her hands, regaining the pair’s attention, “hey! Eyes over here! You mentioned the crown guard, what makes you think they’re working under a different authority than the chain of command?”

Nydas broke off the hug, “um.. right, sorry. They talked about their ‘employer’ and how they would usher in a regime that was more fair for the commonfolk if things went right, that their employer was one of them.”

Wylan turned to Acrasia, “well… we might have a lead in that regard…”

Acrasia shook her head, “no, no way. Don’t you dare bring Diane into this.”

Nydas blinked, “did you say Diane? She was the captain of the guard who was leading the crown guard I spied on.”

Wylan gasped, “she’s in this too? Acrasia, we have to find out more, for our father and Nydas’ friends.”

Acrasia squeezed her eyes shut, “no no no! Diane would never betray the crown. Don’t make me betray her trust.”

Wylan placed his hand on her shoulder, “Acrasia, I’m not asking you to do anything accept try to coax information out of you. She trusts you. If she doesn’t reveal anything, then that’s that and you were right. But if she does, isn’t that worth giving a try? For father?”

Acrasia turned her eyes downward, “only coaxing, that’s it. And whatever you two do, don’t intervene.”

Wylan nodded, “you have our word.”

“And also mine,” Nydas added.

Acrasia sighed, “good. When I meet up with Diane in the gardens, I’ll try to bring it up. Then I’ll let you know what I learn.”

Nydas turned to Wylan, “oh, would it be possible to borrow a uniform from the castle? Any guard or menial worker will do, and with the clearance that goes with it. I need my name in the system, if possible.”

Wylan stroked his chin, “perhaps, but you’ll need a false name.”

Nydas hummed in throught, “you’re right. Howabout… Sydan?”

Wylan chuckled, “that’s just the letters in your name mixed up, isn’t it?”

Nydas blushed, “guilty as charged!”

Wylan grinned, “you’re adorable.”

“Not as much as you,” Nydas smiled and pecked Wylan’s cheek.

Wylan blushed, “for luck?”

Nydas giggled, “no, this time it was just because you’re cute.”

Wylan eeped, blushing brighter. Nydas chuckled, “see you soon, my prince.” He once again leaped out the window, a bright smile stuck on his face as he faded into the shadows.
