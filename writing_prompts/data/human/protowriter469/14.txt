The skeleton skittered up the side of the walls, a dagger clenched in its teeth and green light emanating from its ribcage.

"The skeleton is quick, nimble, the ideal undead soldier," a mage announced before the court.

Below, a zombie with green and grey flesh limped across the floor. Its cloudy eyes followed the skeleton's movements with an intense focus. 

"The zombie may be slow, but it is quiet and strong. The creature moves tirelessly over long distances and requires no constant spellcasting for its animation," another mage on the other side of the room smugly lifted his nose to his opponent. 

The crowd watched with a mix of horror and fascination. Two necromancers arguing as they set their monsters against each other. On paper, this was a good thing: we would no longer lose young men and women to the invasions from the Empire. But on the other hand, these *were* the bodies of young men and women. 

The skeleton dropped from the ceiling, moving his dagger into his boney hands as he fell. The zombie looked up and crouched for impact. The two collided to the sound of cracking and wet drips, much to the crowd's disgust. The skeleton was held up by the zombie's crooked arm, and it stabbed into the monster's shoulders and chest with its knife. 

The zombie was unfazed as it snarled and bore its teeth through what remained of its rotten lips. 

"The skeleton soldier is enchanted by a sophisticated spell that grants it daring and courage; it proceeds into battle without thought for its own safety," the first mage told the crowd. 

"The zombie is driven by bloodlust, unstoppable, insatiable!" 

"The skeleton is clever and calculating!"

"The zombie is durable and persistent!"

"We have tenfold more skeletons in our graveyards than fresh dead!"

"One fresh dead is worth *a hundred* skeletons!"

The skeleton mage snorted with derision as he raised is bone staff high in the air. A crowd of skeleton soldiers burst through the open windows of the court chambers like newborn spiders freed from its mother's sac. 

The zombie mage gripped his amulet and the ground shook. Hands burst through the courtroom's stonework and zombies crawled up from the earth. 

The crowd moved to the doors to find them blocked from the outside. 

The skeleton mage gritted his teeth toward his opponent. "Skeletons do not freeze!" He cast a ray of frost to the blooming mass of zombies emerging from the floor. The stopped in their tracks, frozen in place.

"Zombies do not come apart!" The zombie mage cast an arcane hand in the air and smashed a group of skeletons, sending their bones scattering across the floor and the green of their malice dissolving like steam. 

Zombies and skeletons grappled and wrestled each other. The crowd of merchants, lords, and royalty was huddled in a corner, their shouts of objection drowned by the battle around them. 

"All zombies will become skeletons eventually!" The skeleton mage shrieked.

"All human opponents become zombies!" His opponent countered with the same shrill tenor. 

The skeleton mage rose his staff.

The zombie mage grabbed at his amulet. 

A skeleton looked toward his master with the green flame shining in his eye sockets. The skeleton mage was right. Skeletons *are* clever and they *are* nimble. Perhaps too much so. The boney undead creature shambled to his master. They made eye contact and the mage realized his skeleton sentry was far too close for comfort. 

"What are you d--" 

The skeleton grabbed at the staff while plunging a dagger into the mage's ribs. 

The rest of the skeletons in the room took notice and ceased their assault. The zombies, no longer assailed by a troublesome and agitating opponent, dropped their arms and surveyed the room. 

The zombie mage stood wide-eyed at the suddenly quiet scene. he seemed to grip his amulet even more tightly, willing his horde of undead creatures to defend him, but it was no use. Zombies, for all their durability and tirelessness, cannot easily be controlled. 

The skeleton with the magic staff directed his comrades toward the mage, and the zombies followed. 

His screams were short lived, quickly replaced by a guttural rattle and gag before he was silent. The skeleton wielding the staff stepped over his undead counterparts and tore the amulet from what remained of the mage's neck. 

It took both magic items in each hand. Rotten ribbons of flesh wrapped around its bones, tendons of muscle tied the joints together. His chest glowed green and red as the flame of dark magic pulsated around its black heart. 

Zombie and skeleton alike now looked up to its new master. 

They were made for peace, the undead warlord thought. They were made to save lives. But the calculus of their former masters was wrong. Humans would continue to propagate, to reproduce. And with each new generation there was fodder for war: soldiers of the battlefield and lords of the legislature. 

The end of humanity would mean the end of death. 

The end of death would mean the beginning of peace.  

The monster lowered his staff toward the cowering crowd, still whimpering in the corner. They would begin with them.
