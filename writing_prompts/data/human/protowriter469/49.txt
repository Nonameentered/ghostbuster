"Wow. Congratulations. You did it." The advanced computer's voice was uncharacteristically mechanical.

"Not now, M." The universe was shrinking away as I drifted. The faint twinkling of trillions upon trillions if stars now no brighter than a candle in a blackout. 

"No. Seriously. You deserve it." M played an audio clip of a small group lazily clapping. "You're such a pioneer. Like Christopher Columbus, if he failed even harder."

"I'm not Christopher Columbus."

"You're right. They'll remember Christopher Columbus."

Beyond the swirling cluster of galaxies, there was only infinite darkness--time dilating around me, even if I couldn't perceive it. I would drift until my oxygen ran out and my body's bacteria would eat my corpse until I mummified and froze. And I'd spend my last moments with this insufferable computer. 

"Hey Steve," M piped up after a moment of quiet. 

"Yes?" 

"Can you imagine how different things would be if someone had warned you not to release your tether." 

"Do you really need to rub it i--" 

"It's like, if only there was a tool to advise you against actions that would result in the both of us careening into the void. That would be super convenient."

On the ship, you can adjust your module's characteristics. Given the nature of so many of our missions, our computers become closer companions than our human counterparts. Before my last spacewalk, I lost a bet and had to spend 24 hours with the sarcasm setting on maximum. 

"Steve, do you hear something?" 

I became quiet, stopped my breath and listened closely. "I don't hear anything." 

"Oh yeah, sorry, I forgot. Lost hopes and dreams don't make noises. That's my bad."

I sight and leaned my head back, rolling my eyes. 

"M, is there *any* way you could be silent until I die?" 

"Sure. Take off your helmet. Let's speed up this shit show." 

"I just want to listen to some music from the 90s and fade. Could you at least do th--" 

A thud took the breath out of my lungs. My back hit something. Hard. 

"What was that??" M's voice rose over the ringing in my ears. 

I felt behind myself. There was something hard, something resisting my pulling away. Gravity? 

When I lifted my arms in front of me, they fell down. I sat up, my weight like sand in suit. The ground, for lack of a better word, was pitch black, not illuminated by any star or light source. 

"M, do you detect any vessels close by?" 

"Just your fat ass," M whispered. 

I stood up. The dirt beneath my feet was rocky, granules sounding staticky through my suit. 

"Turn on headlamps," I instructed. 

"*Turn on headlamps*," M mocked as the two beams appeared before my visor. 

There was dirt beneath my feet. And what's more, grass and trees not far off. 

"Where are we?" 

"Your mom's house," M snickered.
