Every step had to be calculated, every movement slow, steady. The barrels of their guns led them around corners, through doorways and up stairs.

"Find anything?"

She swept aside dry bags of baby wipes and bottle brushes. "No."

He sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose. The headache was already starting: that throbbing behind his eye that made him both exhausted with nausea and exhilarated with pain. Couldn't it wait until they were back at camp? Did they always have to come on supply runs?

"No sense hunting for what's not here," he sighed. "One more stop and we'll head home."

They quietly made their way toward the exit, the metal frame half collapsed, it's gate propped up with a car jack.

She had paused in the cart corral. When he turned around to see she wasn't covering his six he hissed through the dark lobby." Come on!"

Silently, she pointed. He followed her finger to old coin games caked with grime. Except one.

It was a claw machine, it's glass polished, its boxy chassis freshly cleaned. Inside was a can of baby formula sitting lopsided among plastic orbs containing keychain and slinkies.

Both approached the odd machine, and it lit up, blaring a circus anthem, it's lights flashing red and blue and yellow.

The pair recoiled, instinctively raising their guns.

"Is that... Formula?" His voice trembled.

"Looks like it."

"Stand back." He raised the butt of his rifle, but she stopped him.

"Look." Inside the machine was a sign. "Don't shake the machine!" Below the sign was a hand grenade, a mechanism zip-tied to its pin.

She slowly lowered his weapon. "If we hit the machine, it'll drop the granade."

Who's idea was this, he wondered. It was sick. Vile.

But confusing at the same time. The sign and the grenade didn't seem like sloppy additions by bandits. It seemed BUILT IN to the game.

"How do we know it's a real grenade?" He squinted close to the glass.

"It looks real to me." She would know, having spent so many months tending the armory. "Besides, it's not worth the risk."

He walked to a downed machine across the lobby and smashed its front. Quarters fell on to the floor and scattered with a deafening crash.

Her eyes went wide as she glared in his direction. "What the hell!?" She whispered.

He picked up a handful of quarters and walked back to the claw machine. "We can play, can't we?"

Her head was on a pivot, surveying the environment for attackers. Wouldn't this be the perfect distraction to catch scavengers unaware? She knew they couldn't stay long. She also knew there was probably no formula in the can.

He missed the can, barely gripping it with the claw's weak grip before it slipped through.

"Damn it!"

"Shh!" She urged her companion.

He tried for an hour, each time barely moving the can, each loss a blow to his confidence.

"One more try," he announced.

"Fine. Then we go."

He picked up a new quarter and inserted it into the machine. He moved the claw over the can and dropped it.

The claw gripped the plastic top that huggers the can's rim. It caught, and the can lifted into the air. With a loud crash, it was deposited into the rewards cubby.

He had to restrain his giddiness at the win.

He reached into the flap to retrieve his prize, and the bear trap clamped down on his hand.
