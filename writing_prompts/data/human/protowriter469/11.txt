The crew had begun to gather on the observation deck, some off-duty and laying down blankets, their arms full of wine bottles and glasses. Three weeks into the voyage and there were already some romances sprouting, maintenance crew men and weapons girls sharing stiff bathroom towels, reclined and giggling over beers. 

I was standing, alone, at the balcony railing, peering through the massive window that domed with the curve of our round ship. I'd never seen voidspace before. I'd been working in space for the better part of 30 years; this was something *new*, something *shocking*. There was a lot of us who were against the use of it. We mostly appealed to the economic impacts of local asteroid mining industries, what it would do to their jobs, families, etc. 

But really, we were scared. What lived in the void that scared our intelligent galactic neighbors so much that they cut off contact with us when we announced our discovery? What was the danger they were afraid even to name? 

The deck was getting crowded. Conversation and laughter was filling the air, the crew waiting with bated breath to see what promised to be "a life-changing experience." When the PA system came on to announce the launch countdown, all talking on the deck stopped. 

*Five!...Four!....Three!...Two!...*

The canvass of stars around the window seemed to shrink, condensed to a line of white light. The deck was deathly silent, the hands along the railing gripping it until their knuckles were white. 

Then a burst of soft red light, clouds replacing the bleak blackness that we were looking at before. We were coasting through an ethereal plane. Somewhere there was a gentle harmonic sound, soothing to the ears.

A tear ran down my cheek. What was I looking at? It was something marvelous, something magnificent. Something divine. 

We were only in the voidspace for about five seconds, but many claimed it felt like house, days. *Some of the best days of my life*. When black, star-scattered space came back into view, the conversations on deck were hushed. There were more than a few sniffling noses and muffled cries. 

I looked around at the crowd, now slowly rolling up their blankets and carting off empty bottles. There was something new in their eyes, in their steps. Optimism? Some kind of gladness, refreshment. 

I shared the emotion, feeling lighter on my feet, clear of mind. I was 50 this year, five years from retirement, but I felt like I had all the time in the world to accomplish anything I wanted. 

I nearly spoke to one of the other crewmates who'd been standing next to me, but I thought better of it. Let the young make friends and lovers. I can't bring myself to make new friends now. But damn, how I wanted to. 

I returned to my quarters, a reasonably spacious suite with a bed, a desk, and a small bathroom. I wanted to write down my thoughts, reflect on my life. I wanted to chart out my retirement...maybe buy a boat? I laughed at my own line of thought. How predictable a spaceman would want an isolating vessel after a career of isolation. 

I decided to wash my face first, center my thoughts. 

I stood before my sink and splashed water in my face. 

My reflection was soft and handsome, like I'd happened to cross the path of someone who looked like me, and who I liked besides. It was a new feeling for me. A good one, I think. 

My thoughts kept racing back to the same place: *why would they keep us from this* and *everyone should see the voidspace.* I shook my head clear. I was a scientist, not a guru. There was still so much data to collect, surveys to create, trends to analyze. There was still so much we didn't know. 

My reflection winked at me. I laughed, warmed by the friendly gesture. 

And then my skin went cold. *I* didn't wink. But the mirror did. And a smile spread across its face.
