I turned my key in the box and pulled out the stack of coupons, ads, and bills that had accumulated over the past couple days. I closed it and pulled the keys out and walked up the stairs to my apartment. 

Walking in after a long day is always the best part. I know houseplants aren't really pets--they run to greet you or lick your face--but I'll be damned if they didn't seem glad to see me. 

I put my mail on the kitchen counter and filled a plastic cup with water from the tap. I went to each potted plant and poured water into the soil. The leaves seemed to visibly perk up with the feeding. 

"Good afternoon, dears," I told them in my sing song voice. My grandma used to tell me that classical music helped plants to grow, but heavy metal killed them. In reality, plants don't care much for any music, all they really need is sunlight and water. And me. 

I went to my room and changed into something cozier for the evening: an old t-shirt, PJ pants, and fuzzy socks. I left my high-heeled work shoes, pencil skirt, blouse, and bra on the floor where they landed. 

I washed my face in the bathroom, scrubbing my makeup off and enjoying the warm water against my skin. There was an audible *thump* in the living room.

My first thought was that I must have left the watering cup somewhere precarious. Or, worse yet, I bumped a plant and it had fallen down. I dried my face quickly and rushed into the other room to assess the damage. 

Everything seemed in order: the pants were still in their pots, the cup was still on the counter. 

This is an apartment, I reminded myself. Thumps happen. 

I shrugged and turned back to the bathroom. There was a minty cucumber scrub I wanted to try t--

*Thump*

I whipped back around. The sound was certainly coming from inside my apartment. I bounced off my walls and shook the floor beneath me. 

I crept into the living room, surveying it for any intruder. My purse was on the floor by my door, and inside was my pepper spray. If someone was inside, I wouldn't have a chance. 

"Hello?" I foolishly announced.

There was no answer. 

I stood up straight and walked around the room, picking up my purse in the process. "Is someone there?" 

There was no answer. 

I made sure my apartment was empty and stood still in the middle of the room waiting for the next thump. 

After a few minutes, when it never came, I went back to the bathroom, my purse over my shoulder. 

I wasn't halfway down the hall again when the thump came louder and harder. 

*Motherf--*

I launched myself into the living room, which was still empty. But something was different. My plants were leaning to the side, each leaf pointing to the table. 

There was only a flower vase and a stack of mail there, but on top of the mail pile was a blank envelope. 

Shakily, I picked up the letter and watched as the plants bent back to their original position in unison. 

The envelope was light and creamy in color with shimmering gold borders. I ran my finger under the flap and gently opened it, revealing a golden interior that seemed to reflect every ray of ambient light in my dim dining area. 

But there was no letter.

I unfolded the rest of the envelope, pulled the golden interior outward until it was a rectangle piece of paper. The creases from the fold has disappeared entirely. In the golden background I could see my distorted reflection, my eyes and mouth blurred and disproportional to my face. 

I thumbed the edged of the paper to find another fold, a place where the paper split in two. I unfolded it from there, doubling the size of the disassembled envelope, and creating a large canvas of glittering gold parchment. 

I moved the flower vase aside and laid the strange paper on my table. The golden finish was cool to the touch and jagged against my fingers. Its indents couldn't be flattened and its ridged remained rigid against pressure. 

It felt like rock. 

But the envelope had been so light. 

*Thump*

The impact made me jump back with fright. The noise came from the paper, this time with an audible *clink* as well. 

I didn't like this thing and I didn't feel comfortable with it in my house. Apartment. Whatever. 

I tried to fold it back up, but the paper had become a heavy slab. Was it growing? Getting heavier? Was I hallucinating? Everything else around me seemed normal--this was no acid trip. 

A gold rock loosened and fell away from the center of the golden slab. Then two. Then more. It kept on crumbling, stones falling to my floor and to the table. Some fell *into* the golden slab. I reached into my purse for my pepper spray. 

A hand emerged from the crumbling gold before me. My mind couldn't process the shallow table below the slab and the arms rising from inside of it. 

A head pushed itself out from the gold. It had curly brown hair, soft, creamy skin, and golden eyes. 

"A little help?" He said.
