She sounds like a very fascinating character. With your background I imagine you're much more qualified than I to speak on mental health things.

As for verbiage, I can only speak for how I would write about it.

"My hands shook as I lifted the glass of fizzy wine to my lips. I'd arrived 30 minutes early, like always, to get a lay of the land before the date started. I didn't like to be caught off guard in someone else's domain. Not ever again. My face became hot as the flashbacks flipped through my head like an old-fashioned projector, and I had to talk myself out of the shame spiral before it ruined my entire evening. Part of me wanted to give in to the anger. Part of me wanted to start running and never stop. I took another sip of the wine, letting the bubbles pop on my tongue, anything to clear my head."

Thats how I would write her, if that helps.
