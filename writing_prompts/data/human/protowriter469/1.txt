The cigarette had burned down to its filter, staining my finger tips brown and singeing  my knuckle hair. I deposited the spent butt in my cup holder, squishing it against the cheap Japanese plastic. 

I was parked outside of the complex, a dingy place filled with degenerates and low-lifes--the kinds of people society was better off forgetting about. The car dinged as I pushed the driver door open and stepped out. The air was unseasonably warm for this time of year; not the weather for a coat, and yet I'd be wearing mine anyway. The more of my body concealed, the better. 

Vagrants lined the stairwell like lethargic gargoyles, shooting warning glances. *this was not the place to be caught off guard,* they told. *Least of all by us.* But this was small-time scum, the type so strung out they might've forgotten to eat for several days. I could snap each one of these people like a twig. When they saw I wasn't rattled, they averted their glances and sank back into their nests of coats and filth. 

I arrived at 103, the white paint on the door scuffed, scraped, and soiled to the point of no return. A dim light flickered in the hallway just above me, a defect too small for the landlord to risk his life here fixing it. 

I knocked. 

No answer. 

It's amazing how the guilty know when judgement is near. Something in their souls frightens them; they stop picking up their phones, answering their doors. I looked up and down the decrepit hallway to make sure there were no witnesses before I kicked the fragile plywood door down. 

Filth crept up the walls from the floors. Piles of garbage were collected at the corners of rooms, flies and vermin swarming their contents. The stench was intense, like rotting meat and chemical spills. 

"Knock knock," I announced as I stepped over the collapsed door. 

There was a rustling somewhere in the apartment, a dim light briefly interrupted by a shadow. I pulled out my pistol and moved forward, muzzle first. 

"I'm here to make a collection," I called. 

"Take what you want," a voice replied from a shut door where light was escaping from the gaps. 

"What I want is in that room." 

Silence again. I stood beside the door, not in front of it, and waited. This man was in a desperate state; unpredictable. Dangerous. 

Three shots rang out in the small space, punching bullet holes through the door. They embedded in the opposite wall and I let out a gurgle and a groan--something to tell him he was successful. 

The door cracked open, illuminating the dark space with the sickly orange light of his bathroom. His gun came out first, shaking as he aimed outward. 

In a fluid motion, I grabbed the pistol and twisted it up, straining his fingers and wrist as they bent backwards. He yelped and pulled away, a foolish, instinctive act, but ultimately a predictable one. Junkies are all the same: washed up, inexperienced, cowardly thieves. 

I moved forward swiftly, backing him up into the bathroom, my gun pressed to his chest. 

His mouth was wild with blubbering and begging, his eyes squinting shut, pushing out tears. 

"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry," he repeated. 

"Look at me," I told him. 

He peered up and his eyes found what I was holding. It was a photograph of a young girl dressed in a red-and-white dress and smiling through brand new braces. 

It registered and uttered a frustrated cry. "What do you want? Take anything! Call the police! Just don't hurt me." 

"You fucked around," I told him calmly, betraying the fire in my own chest. "Now, you find out."
