I jumped back quickly, up on my feet, my legs in a crouch and my hands in front of me defensively. "Who--what--where--" my mind raced to place the panic, to spot whatever was threatening me. But there was nothing--and no one--there. Just a dark space beneath a rock shelf covered in snow. 

A thought lingered at the tip of my mind; a fleeting image of some terrible dream, but the more I tried to recall it, the further it slipped away. What was I so scared of? I rubbed at my eyes to find my hands covered by thick mittens and my face mostly obscured by a winter mask. What are these called again? Baclava? No, that's a dessert. 

I shook my head. What my mask is called isn't important. *Where am I*?

As the adrenaline drained from my chest, the throbbing headache became clearer. My tongue was like sand paper in my mouth, a rancid taste coating it and wafting up to my nostrils. I reached out of the little alcove and took a scoop of snow in my mittened hand while pulling the mask down with the other. The frosty powder was frigid in my mouth, but the moisture was a welcome relief. Already, my aching head began clearing up somewhat. 

But eating snow is no substitute for water. If I continued like this, I'd freeze from the inside out. I'd need to find some proper shelter somewhere.

The horizon was blindingly white, wind whipping up snow from the ground and casting a fog all around me. There didn't seem to be any equipment where I was sleeping in the alcove, only myself and the cold weather gear I had on. *What was I doing out here?*

Typically, if you're lost in the wilderness, you should stay still, wait for rescue teams to find you. If you start moving, your chances of being rescued drop dramatically. I knew that, logically. But some foreboding feeling in my body compelled me out into the frosty mist. It wasn't quite fear, but it wasn't merely curiosity either. 

I chose a direction and started walking, trying my best to keep moving in a straight line. The more I walked, the more I could feel my empty stomach jostle in my guts, its straining, cramping pains sending darkness around my vision. I picked up more snow, trying to find ice on the ground I could chew on, so I could fool my body into thinking I had more for it. 

It worked for a little while, enough at least that my body stopped punishing me for not feeding it. 

I came upon a tree standing in isolation amidst the tundra. Oddly, its leaves were all intact, frozen in place. Tiny pink blossoms were dragged down by long icicles and birds' nests were dotted along the snow-covered branches. 

What kind of tree is this that doesn't change in the winter? If I hadn't known any better, I'd say  it was a victim of el ni√±o: a wild, non-seasonal cold spell flash freezing the ground beneath it. I assessed the depth of the snow under my feet. How long would this spell have to last to produce so much snow? 

Past the tree I spotted lights in windows. My heart skipped in my chest and I moved as quickly as I could through the snow to reach what I hoped was some kind of town. 

As I reached the gate, I found mounds of snow piled high beside dirt roads and quaint, stone-style houses. Above one door was a sign reading "Tavern." I kicked the snow from my boots on the front stoop before opening the door. 

Oil lamps and candlelight illuminated the cozy room while a small number of patrons drank from glass mugs and copper cups. Eyes turned up to see me and I returned their stare with a wave of my mitten. 

"Hello," I said to the tavern patrons. 

"What in the *Hell* do you think you're doing here!?" Shouted the bartender as he lobbed a pot across the room. 

I flinched as it fell and rattled at my feet. "Whoa, what was that for?"

"Don't play dumb with me, boy. I told you a thousand times before to stay gone!" 

"I've never been here before," I explained. 

He rolled his eyes at me. "Spare me the song and dance. Turn around and get gone." 

"Hold on, I feel like there's some confusion here," I lowered my voice to try to calm the situation. 

"Confusion, yes. On your part. Before you started coming around here, this was a nice town, warm and clean. But now you come through every other week, destroying the damn place with your *I-don't-know-who-I-am* song and dance."

I opened my mouth to respond to him. But I didn't say anything. *Who am I*?
