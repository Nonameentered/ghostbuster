"James? Yes. Yeah. He's, uh, just in the living room watching TV." She started leading the way, but I stopped her. 

"Why don't I go introduce myself, and you can go get ready. I've been doing this for a while, I'm pretty good with kids."

Relief swept over her eyes. When was the last time this woman's had a night off? I started to worry she might leave and not come back.

"Thank you so much, Zelda." She folded my hands in hers. "Just shout if you need anything.

"I went to the other room, where a little boy was sitting on the floor looking up at a huge mounted television. Modern Marvels was detailing the history of bridges. Exhilarating.  Not exactly 7-year old fare."

James?" I called gently, leaning into the room from the tall archway that connected it to the atrium.

He looked up nonplussed. "Yes?"

"Hi. I'm Zelda. I'm going to be your babysitter tonight."

"Zelda." He repeated my name. "Weird."

*Well fuck you too, James*, I thought, but, obviously, didn't say.

"I get that a lot," I laughed instead. "What are you watching?"

"Television."

"Oookay. Is that what you want to do al night or did you have other things in mind?"

"I'm not the babysitter," he answered, eyes glued to the computer-generated demonstration of Roman archways. "If you want me to do your job you'll have to cut me in on the money."

Ah. No wheelchair. No speech impediments. No IVs sticking out of my arms. He's just an asshole.

"I see. Well, James, I'm going to sit down right here. When you're hungry or bored or tired, you let me know what I can do to help." I plopped into the cushy loveseat across the room and took in the space around me.

The ceiling was tall, like the atrium. A beam of wood spanned the width, holding three black fans and spotlights. It was...rustic-modern? If that's a thing. It looked good, is what I'm saying. Rich.

Maybe if I did a good job they'd keep me on retainer. Could I move in? They probably had a guest room. A guest house. Can you imagine? By the pool they almost certainly also had?

"I'm bored." The little shit piped up. I looked down to see him somehow right in front of my face, staring straight at me.

The credits were rolling on the show and a prompt in the corner asked if we wanted to watch the next one. The subject: prisons. I didn't realize the irony until later.

"What do you want to do?"

"It's not my job to figure that out," he retorted with the small, smug smile.

I could fight you, kid. I could take you. You have no idea.

"Well, why don't you give me a tour of the place and we'll go from there? I don't know what kind of toys you have."

He sighed and rolled his eyes. "Fine. Come on."

He walked me across the sprawling manor. However massive it looked on the outside, it was doubly so inside. They had rooms. Rooms in rooms. Some of the room rooms had rooms inside of those! ROOM ROOM ROOMS! For whom!?His bedroom was magnificent. He had a pitched tend connected to the ceiling with fairy lights draped across. It was his "reading nook."

He had his own king-size bed, floating cloud lights, a TV, a computer...when I was his age, I shared a twin sized bed my sister and I was grateful.

"Zelda! I'm heading out! My number's on the fridge, call me if you need anything!" Before I could wish her a happy outing or ask about the "extreme special needs," the door slammed.

"So, this is my room," James showed me with a lazy flourish.

"Cool," I nodded. "Listen, I have to go downstairs and grab your mom's number, put it in my phone before I forget."

"But I'm bored," he reminded me.

"I know, but I'll be right back. It'll take two seconds.

"I power-walked back through the sprawling house, somehow eventually making my way to the grandiose, obscenely well-stocked kitchen. Her number and a $20 bill were clipped to the fridge. Cool. Pizza money. I started typing the number in my phone when I heard James upstairs.

"I'M BORED!"

The floor rumbled and the delicate light fixtures overlooking the island/brunch...desk...swayed. There was a crashing and violent shake. An earthquake, I was sure.

I stopped what I was doing and I rushed back the way I came. Or, at least I thought I was. Didn't I take a left here? Or...could it have been a right? The hallways were all the same, cream-colored with wrought iron conches on the walls.

I walked around in a circle, the hallway leading, somehow, back to itself. Finally, after trying several doors, some of which were literal staircases to blank, creamy walls, I found my way back into the atrium and up the stairs.

When I arrived to James' room, it was a wreck. The tent had been knocked down, the mattress was clear across the room. His dressers were empty and his closet clothes strewn on the floor.

"What happened? Are you okay!?""No! I'm not okay! I'm BORED. Do your job!"

Note to self, never let James be bored.
