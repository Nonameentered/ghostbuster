He wafted quietly down the hallway, followed by the click-clacking of smart heels against the wooden floorboards. 

"Someone *nice*," he whispered, his voice as transparent as his shapeless, sheet-like body. 

"'Nice,' she countered, "is subjective. You'll need to be more specific." The real estate agent flicked through her phone, her eyeglasses raised, resting on the crown of her head. 

"Nice, like..." the ghost pondered. "Someone who likes animals. Someone who bakes cakes. Someone who plants plants." 

"*Plants plants*," she repeated, pretending to take down the qualification.

"Someone who loves life!" The ghost arrived at his point with bouncing flourish, the eye and mouth holes in his floating, shapeless form turning upward with glee. The agent thought he might somersault through the air. Again. 

"I don't know if I've ever met someone who didn't love being alive," she looked up with a raised, pencil-thin eyebrow. 

"Oh, I have." The ghost's expression flattened. His eyes surveyed the hallways, the drywall damage and odd, empty rooms. 

"Right," the agent corrected herself, clearing her throat. "What about a family? Two young parents, a little girl." 

The ghost wafted his form through the air behind the agent's shoulder to look at her phone. The family was standing together, the father holding the young girl, the mother leaning against his arm. The little girl had a plush doll tucked neatly under her arm. 

"What is she holding there?" the ghost asked, nodding at the screen. 

The agent zoomed in on the image, revealing a pixelated white ghost doll peering through her grasp. 

"I think that might be perfect," the ghost glowed. 

"Great," the agent said without enthusiasm. "But you remember your part of the deal, right?" 

"Make the place inviting," he recited the instructions.

"And not like last time," the agent warned, reminding the spirit of the fiasco that scared away the last interested party. 

With pursed lips--if you could call them that--the ghost nodded.

"Okay. I'll schedule a showing tomorrow at noon. You know what to do."
