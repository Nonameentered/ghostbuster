I carried the cardboard box of what I imagined cubicle-dwellers would need at the office: some pens, a silly mug, a cutout Dilbert comic, that sort of thing. The parking lot was large, and temps had to park in the back, which was fine. I didn't want to get completely out of shape. Besides, no amount of inconveniences here could compare to the disrespect from... Well...

The temp agency already had my ID and pass printed. I slid my key card through the front door, and the reader flashed green as the door's lock disengaged.

The lobby was modest, but clean. This end of town was typically quiet. Not much crime, no skyscrapers, no giant-vaulted banks. A young woman manned the reception desk, flanked on each side by stairwells and directly below a giant BECKUM INC. sign.

"Good morning," she sighed, her glasses reflecting the solitaire game on her computer screen.

"Hi. I'm the new temp," I told her as I adjusted the overloaded cardboard box in my arms.

"Super cool." Her flat exhale of a reaction assured me that I was not, in fact, super cool.

It might've been disappointing to someone else to find themselves in a bland office with bland people doing bland work. But to me it was a breath of fresh air. Like warm diet coke in the middle of the desert.

"Third floor. Elevator's around the corner." Her hand lazily gestured off to the left.

I followed the loose directions and made my way to the lift just the down the hall.

I pressed the plastic up arrow and waited for the metal doors to open up for me. When they did, I stepped inside, pressed '3,' and waited for them to close.

They had almost shut completely when a hand reached in, prompting it to open back up.

I recognized him immediately.

A curl of black hair resting on his forehead. A chin that could sink a ship. Eyes always weirdly half-squinting like he were gazing upon his kingdom from pride rock.

"Good morning," he involuntarily pronounced in his vibrato baritone.

"Dynaman," I nodded. His weak, thick-rimmed glasses disguise nearly fell off his face.

He cleared his throat and pushed the spectacles back up his nose. "Yes, well. I would expect a fellow super to recognize me in-cognito," he said the last work with a strange flourish, like a tourist ordering an almost-exotic drink at a half-rate resort. *Mojito.*

"Okay."

Dynaman punched the elevator stop button. Or, at least, I'm suspecting that was his plan. His large mitt smashed the console, stopping the elevator but also destroying any way of getting it going again.

"Squireboy, what sort of stunt is this?" the brawny superhero turned to me, seemingly ignorant of the property damage he just caused.

"It's just Javier now. And it's no stunt. It's a job." I shrugged. "And I'm going to be late now. So thanks."

He reflexively waved off my thanks, missing my sardonic tone completely. "But this is such a normal job. For normal people. You're one of us! Exceptional!"

"Thanks. But I was a sidekick. Jet Knight will do just fine without me. You all will."

Dynaman looked away as he tucked his lips into his mouth. "Listen, Squireboy--"

"Javier."

"Shh, shh, shh. Listen, things with Jet Knight. You see... I think your leaving upset him..."

"My leaving!?" I nearly dropped my box. "I was fired!" I barked with a wicked guffaw.

"Fired." The big guy repeated my word as he scratched his clean-shaven chin. "Well, it's no matter. He needs you back."

"If he needs help, why don't you go help him? Why are you bothering me?"

"It's not help with a villain, per se."

"Then what is it?"

Dynaman sighed. "So, last week he drove his rocket through a Wendy's drive-thru. After that, he double parked it in a life flight helipad."

"I don't see h--"

"He has been shoplifting--frequently--telling the store employees that 'freedom is never free' and that 'he knows Kroger personally.'"

I waited for a moment before speaking. "So, what you're saying is--"

"He has been attempting to withdraw money by sending signed headshots through the vacuum tubes and writing 'it's me' on the back. He thinks that his costume doesn't need to be washed. It's been several weeks. It's becoming a health issue. I don't think he knows how to do it."

I snorted with laughter. "Are you surprised a trustfund baby with a god complex can't run a load of laundry or balance a checkbook? I'm not his nanny. I have my own life."

"Yes, and I can empathize with that." Dynaman's face became grim. "But Jet Knight has started talking to Erika again too."

"Oh shit." I really did drop my box this time.

"Yeah."

"We have to go."
