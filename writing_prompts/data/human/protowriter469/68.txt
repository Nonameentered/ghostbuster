She looked down at my hand. "We don't take card." 

"Oh," I cooed apologetically, now fidgeting aimlessly with my cash-less wallet. "I don't have any cash." 

"No pizza for you," she quickly retorted. 

I suppose some of the charm of mom and pop pizza parlors is their reserved right to treat you like shit. Who are you going to call? Corporate? There's no corporate. There's only mom and pop, sovereign dictators of this hollowed gas-station-turned-restaurant. 

"Do you know where I can find an ATM?" 

She sniffed hard, her wrinkles all pulling together in the effort. "There's a gas station a couple miles down." She shrugged. "Don't know if the ATM works or not." 

"Great," I murmured with zero enthusiasm as I returned my card to my wallet. "I'll be right back." 

I jumped back in my car, now covered in a fine film of sandy dust. This middle-of-nowhere New Mexico town was going to be the death of me. 

Now, which direction did she say? Just down the road? Roads go both ways, lady. 

I deduced that the gas station must not have been in the direction I'd come from or I would have stopped there and bought a Slim Jim instead of enduring the iron rod of queen pizza. I drove West along the barren road, watching the sand whip up in dust devils, throwing haze into the air. I could look right at the sun, a pale sphere behind the dust.

I finally found some structures in the distance, mere silhouettes in a small sandstorm. I pulled over to find a single pump, a shack, and an ATM standing in the middle of nothing. There was no paved driveway, no electric poles, no nothing. Just three rectangles bolting up from the flat, dry ground. 

I approached the ATM, shielding my eyes from the buffeting sand that started pelting against my face. 

I inserted my card into the machine and put a hand over the screen to see a little better. 

The display was like an old alarm clock, the numbers black polygons against a greenish backdrop. 

PLEASE ENTER YOUR PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBER

I punched the numbers into the sticky metal keypad and four asterisks popped onto the screen. 

This felt like an antique, but how old were ATMs, really? 40, 50 years old at the most? I looked at the machine's chassis. "Memory Bank" was written across the top in a faded, retro font. Must be a local credit union or something. 

CHOOSE ACTION  
\> DEPOSIT  
\> WITHDRAW  
\> QUICK CASH  
\> WARP

I cocked my head at that last option. Warp? Was that some local account promotion thing? Like, Warp Savings? I pressed withdraw.

ENTER YOUR BIRTHDATE

It was a strange ask, but whatever. I entered 10/24/1988. 

PICK DISIRED WITHDRAW DATE

It presented me with another blank box. Obviously, I needed the money today. 05/25/2022.

STANDBY WHILE WE PROCESS YOUR TRANSACTION.

Three dots popped up behind the sentence as it loaded. Did it ask me how much I wanted out? I need $20 for the pizza and a coke. I pressed the red X on the keypad, but it didn't seem to do anything. 

The wind whipped against my clothes and exposed skin, stinging as it impacted. I looked up to see that a dust devil had begun to spin right over me. It was in my hair and my nose and my mouth, the granules of sand grinding in my arm pits and into my pants. 

I covered my eyes while I waited for the ATM to finish. But when I opened them again, I was in my car, driving. I tried to blink hard, but my eyes didn't comply. My hands were moving independently. I was singing to music on the radio, but not on purpose. 

There was that pizza place on the side of the road. "Pizza sounds good," I heard myself say. I pulled over and into the parking lot. 

I tried wrestling my body, kicking and shouting. In an instant, I was back at the ATM, the sandstorm gone. 

WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE ANOTHER TRANSACTION?

I pressed Yes.
