My house sits on the edge of a cliff, overlooking the Pacific ocean as the waves crash and fizzle on the shore. Nobody else lives on this island. Why would they? It's barely a square mile with little vegetation and no significant resources. I doubt anyone knows it even exists. 

My house is packed with books and odds and ends I've picked up over time. To some it might look like a dark, cluttered space, but for me, every trinket, every pile of cash, every painting and every jewel--they tell a story. 

That story is my vengeance. It's me collecting what's from a world that had robbed and broken me from my very first breath until far too late in my life. When I discovered my gift, I decided I would pay myself back by repossessing the world's treasure for what I'm owed. 

It's occurred to me more than once that this island might be too small to satisfy my judgement. Bu I would cross that bridge when got there. 

I reclined on my sofa--lifted from the White House two years ago--and I turned on the 90-inch television mounted on my wall. Solar panels and a windmill outside provided me enough electricity to run most things. In this part of the world, I didn't need air conditioning or heat; the temperature stayed 72 degrees in the shade year-round. 

I flipped through the channels before something caught my eye.

*"They call him 'The Disappearing Man,' due to his uncanny ability to appear in one place and disappear just as quickly."*

I took a perverse delight in watching the world scratch its collective heads over me. I sat back and watched the news reel play out. 

A surveillance camera showed me, in grainy detail, appearing in the hallway of a closed bank. The pictures shook on the wall, crashing at the force of my warp. The further the distance and greater mass I take with me, the bigger the crash at the destination. 

I walked down the hallway casually, wearing all black and a balaclava over my head. Despite my ever-present escape plan, I still didn't want them to see my face. It was nice to eat at a good restaurant from time to time without the police being called. 

The camera followed me around a corner, and then another, until I reached the large, metal vault. 

Most money, it should be noted, is not physical. The amount of cash kept at any one bank is usually fairly modest: less than a million dollars easily. Sometimes less than ten thousand. 

But I didn't *need* money. That wasn't the point of this. 

I looked at the surveillance camera and stared for a moment before warping away. The light fixtures pulled toward where I was a moment ago and swayed in place. 

They cut to the camera in the vault. Here, they kept locked drawers full of cash and other valuables. I noticed they also kept a server tower. I proceeded to pry each drawer open, stuffing the spoils in bags, before tipping the tower over and stomping apart the hard drives. 

Then, as quickly as I appeared, I disappeared. 

*"While most find this a terrifying phenomenon, at least some are benefitting from his hijinks. Carl Trott was engaged in a lawsuit against First Federal Bank of Minneapolis, where the latest threat took place."* They cut to the middle-aged man. *"The bank wanted to foreclose on our home, despite us making payments every month for 25 years."* There were tears in his eyes.

The reporter spoke again. *"Investigations of the bank's robbery turned up evidence that they had been overcharging their customers for years, including evicting and repossessing properties from customers their internal correspondences titled 'too poor for lawyers.' The CEO of the Bank, Robert McMillan, has been arrested, and the victims are being compensated for their losses.*

Now it was Carl again. *"They sent me a check that paid off all my debt, including the house."* He sniffed. *"I know it sounds odd, but thank you, Disappearing Man, for everything you've done for me and my family. I'd shake your hand if I met you in person."*

The report continued on, but I was distracted now. 

Carl had been chewed up by the world, just like me. He seemed honest, hardworking. He didn't hurt anyone, and yet, some bank tried to take everything he had. 

I paralyzed as I sat there, my world crashing around me. 

Am I good?
