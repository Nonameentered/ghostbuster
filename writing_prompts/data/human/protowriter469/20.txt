Wow! What a wonderful thing to wake up to! I'm flattered! Thank you so much! 


Okay, answers:


1. I've always had an interest in writing, but when the pandemic kicked off, I found myself relegated to my house for almost a year. I tried to take it in stride, start some meaningful hobbies. I bought a bike, started cooking more, started learning guitar, and, of course, started writing. I found it to be a cathartic escape, and I generally find boredom to be a good catalyst for creativity.


2. I love taking risks and writing weird things. Although I enjoy reading thrillers and cosmic horror the most, my writing can't help to verge in goofiness. No matter how hard I try to be serious, I can only keep writing if I make fun of my writing while I'm writing.


3. Truff hot sauce. It's like $50 for three bottles. It's an acquired taste. It's controversial; makes me interesting.
