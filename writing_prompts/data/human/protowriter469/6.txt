The sun crested over the hills, its red glow illuminating the stalks of grain swaying like a cosmic tide across the hills. It would be cold again today, Stelle determined. This time last year it was cold too. And the time before that, and most times over the last 400 or so years. She'd become quite adept at forecasting weather, having seen what she's seen and come to know what she's come to know.

The kettle began to whistle-feeble at first but steadily stronger. Stelle stood from her chair and tugged her coat around her middle. The cold didn't bother her, but she enjoyed these human creature comforts: warm garments, hot drinks, a sunrise. She'd been surprised when she first began partaking in those "simple things" so long ago, what with its meaninglessness and dirty, earthly qualities. And yet... there was something profound about a warm cup of tea; something deep and sacred in the stillness of the morning. Sometimes she'd wondered how long she'd have to zoom in to creation before she stopped finding things to fall in love with. 

It wasn't 30 seconds from when she'd closed her door behind her before someone started knocking. Like clockwork, as predictable as the weather.

Stelle poured the boiling water over a teabag in her cup. "Who is it?" 

The door creaked open, revealing the tear-streaked face of a little girl. "Miss S?" Her voice was shaky from a grief only recently stabilized. 

"Ofelia. Come in, girl, it's cold outside." Stelle hurried to the pitiful child, ushering her to a chair and draping a blanket around her shoulders. "Do you want tea?" 

Ofelia nodded and sniffed through her one unclogged nostril. Stelle prepared another cup and carried both to the table. The barefoot little girl had pulled her knees up to her chest and tightened the blanket around her form. Before her, lying lifelessly on the table, was a bow with a snaped string. 

"Up early hunting, were we?" Stelle assessed the damaged weapon.

Ofelia's lumpy form shrugged as her tired eyes watched the steam float from her cup. 

"Would you like me to fix it, dear?" 

An enthusiastic head nodded back. 

Stelle pulled the bow across the table and studied its various parts. It was a toy--plastic. It could never volley an arrow in war, much less survive half a day with a precocious eight-year old. "What if..." 

"What?" An impatient Ofelia blurted out.

"If I fix this for you, it will just break again. What if I made you a *real* bow?"

"That is a '*real bow*,' and I'm good at it!" Despite the offer for help, young Ofelia's emotions were still all frazzled. Stelle knew better than to take it personally. 

"Yes, you're right. Maybe I can fix this bow how you like and build a backup bow as well, just in case. 

After a moment of consideration, Ofelia agreed. "Just in case." 

Stelle spent most days this way: waking early to read the sky, brewing tea, fixing children's problems. In centuries past, some had called her a witch. Pastors had come to town, attempting to run her out, burn down her cottage. 

What the over-zealous ministers didn't count on was just how damn likeable Stelle could be. Anyone who questioned her belonging was soon met with the full force of the village.  

These days, the church was run by a gay Episcopalian man, whom Stelle frequently cross-stitched with. 

The weak string on the Nerf Medieval War Bow^(TM)  was not made to last. It was some sort of flimsy polymer, a disgrace to the history of such a devastating weapon. Ofelia deserved better. 

Walking the toy to her workshop, she unspooled a yellow thread from a roller mounted on her pegboard. It glittered in the lamplight, pungent with the scents of pine and cold to the touch--reminders of the place from which it had been won. 

She strung the toy bow and began crafting a better, wooden weapon. Did an eight-year old need a deadly weapon of war? Of course not. Was Stelle going to build one anyway? Yes. Besides, she could always put a safety enchantment on it later. 

Another knock came at her door. Most likely another child with another broken toy, sad story, or tattle tale. She'd need to set out another cup. 

Walking back into her dining room with the plastic toy in her hand, she found Ofelia sitting next to another figure. 

It wasn't a child, nor any villager from around these parts. 

"There she is!" The straight-jet-black-haired woman clapped her hands together.  "I was just talking to your friend here."

Stella recognized her as soon as she'd opened her mouth. 

"She was telling me all about what a nice old lady you were, how you fix toys and help people all the time." The woman looked as if she was barely holding back her laughter. "Too cute, Quiet." 

"Quiet?" Ofelia questioned. 

"You should leave my house," Stelle warned. Ofelia's face darted from Stelle standing in the doorway to the dining room and the increasingly scary black-haired woman sitting next to her. 

"Yeah! Home! About that, what is... why?" The woman's hands moved around the room, as if the question was so big it escaped words and retreated to the realm of pantomime. 

"I'm happy where am I and doing what I do," Stelle's voice was terse; low as it grumbled from her mouth.  

"Oh," the woman offered sardonic sympathy, her eyebrows arched with care while her mouth still kept that infuriating smile. "Is someone having an existential crisis?" 

The air around Stelle began to ripple. The light in the room dimmed and flickered. "Now you get away from my table and that little girl right now. I want you out of my house and far away, do you hear me?" 

"Relax! I'm going," the woman stood from the table. "I'd hate to ruin your...linoleum. I'm just here to let you know that Dad's called a meeting and you're required to be there." 

The air settled and the lights steadied. "Dad? Why?" 

"Big things are a'happenin'!" The woman giggled as she exited the screen door. "See you there!" 

Stella could only stand there in the middle of her living room, gripping the plastic bow so tightly in her hand that that she'd damaged handle. 

"My bow!" Ofelia whined as she grabbed for its contorted shape. "You broke it more!" 

"I'll, uh... I'll fix it," Stelle whispered. "I'll fix it."
