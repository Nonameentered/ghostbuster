The plate was set before me, a generous helping of elbow Mac and cheese with a side of chicken nuggets. I looked up, perplexed.

"This looks... Just like what *we* eat."

My host's fork was halfway to his own heaping pile of food when he stopped to address my observation.

"Would you say it's *just* like what you eat? Or *a lot* like what you eat?" His voice, a combination of low grunts and shrill squeals, fed into a translator that delivered his words into a more familiar--and palatable--language.

I picked up my fork and turned the noodles over, savory steam rising from the disturbed heap. It looked like mac and cheese. It *smelled* like mac and cheese. I took a bite.

"I'll be damned," I whispered. My host's towering body was bent over the table, focused on my reaction. "This tastes just like mac and cheese."

He clapped his hands together, a discordant collection of excited tones tumbling from his mouth. The translator reiterated the sound with a flat "yaaaaaaaaaay."

"Yay?" I asked through a mouthful of noodles.

He straightened up, his black, pupil-less eyes presumably fixed on me. "So, I have a confession to make."

I stopped chewing immediaty.

"You and your crew are not exactly...uh... The first humans we've met."

I swallowed my half-chewed food and nearly choked on it as it went down. "How's that possible? We only just arrived!"

My mind was racing with the possibilities. We know so little about the nature of time. Are we the first humans relative to Earth's history, only for time dilation through warp speed to make us last in line? Or, maybe, our form was not so rare. Judging from my bipedal, two-eyed host, there might not be so much variation in intelligent lifeforms.

"We snuck on Earth while you were sleeping. We took food and left."

That was... I wasn't expecting that. "I'm sorry?" Perhaps I misheard.

The translator popped and squealed the alien language. My host's head cocked to the side. "I forgive you?"

"No, I mean, did I hear you right? You've been to Earth?"

"Oh, yes. Constantly. We're big fans of Earth cuisine. Particularly the Burger King Texas Double Whopper." The guards and delegates in the chamber clicked with excitement at those words, licking thir lips with their purple tongues and nodding their agreement with each other.

I looked down at my plate again. Mac and cheese and chicken nuggets. They love cheeseburgers. "What else do you like from Earth?"

My host straightened up with excitement, like I'd asked him to tell me all about his favorite TV show.

"Oh! Where to begin?" His fingers trembled as he wringed his hands together. "Pizza!" The room clicked. "Hot dogs!" *click click click* "ICE CREAM!" He was now standing up, both hands in the air victoriously. The room was a clamour of bug-eyed giants clicking their happiness over ice cream.

"So, you like junk food?"

"Junk food?" His arms slowly dropped.

"It's what we call it. It's a leisure food, high in sugar and sodium, negligible nutritional value."

The host slowly descended to his chair, maintaining eye contact with me, I think.

"*Junk* food?"

Had I offended him? I raised my hands, pantomiming my desire for this to deescelate. "I'm sorry if I said something wr--"

"This food ended wars. This food saved millions of lives. This food ushered peace into the empire, joined families alienated by hostile borders and evil regimes." He folded his hands and leaned forward. "And it is your JUNK?"

The room was quiet. I never imagined I'd miss the clicking.

"Have you ever had... Spaghetti?"

There were hushed whispers around the chamber. My host consulted with an advisor, one jet black eye fixed generally in my direction at all times.

"No," he finally answered.

And that's how I became the richest human in the galaxy.
