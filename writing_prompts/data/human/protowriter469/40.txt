"Think of it like this," the bearded man leaned forward with his hands in a tense fold, "deer eat everything: plants, trees, grass, everything. When the flora are decimated, bugs, rodents, lizards, and other creatures are left without a habitat. Birds don't roost where there's no food. Birds' droppings often contain seeds. Many of those seeds become flowers, which bees rely on. The bees pollinate these flowers, creating more flowers, more pollinators, more bugs, more rodents, a greater biosphere." 

He leaned back. "Deer aren't *bad*, of course. They have no moral direction. They do what all creatures seek to do: make more offspring. It's just, when deer have no predators, they destroy their environments. Even deer suffer in this system: they rely on rich ecosystems to supply food and water. When they've eaten all of it, their offspring starve, become feral, aggressive. That's no way to live." 

The crowd in the university auditorium was quiet. 

"Think of us like deer. We have plundered the planet, driven many species to extinction, acidified the oceans, burned the rainforest, and filled the atmosphere with carbon dioxide. Hell, in each of our bloodstreams runs plastic, which has been shown to accelerate cancers."

An isolated cough from the dark seats broke the silence. Students bent forward, many with phones aimed at the speaker, others feverishly writing down his words on a notepad. 

"When we introduce wolves into areas with deer overpopulation, do you know what happens? The wolves eat many deer. They eat *well.* The deer retreat from areas with light brush so they can hide better. The grass grows. The trees return. Rodents and bugs move in, birds return, flowers buzz, bees come back. The deer that remain live better lives.

"So, although the remaining deer might live in fear of the wolves they share a forest with, they spend the time they are alive in abundance: their environments are clean, plentiful. It's a symbiotic system.

"We are the deer and the Earth is the forest. What's arrived three months ago? Wolves." 

Students shifted uncomfortably in their seats.

"Now, I know that sounds heartless. I know you have a lot of questions about this line of reasoning. But I would urge you to think optimistically about this. The new presence that emerged has gone after human beings exclusively. They've shown no interest in aquatic life, land animals, or vegetation. They have flocked to population centers: New York, Los Angeles, Shanghai,  Mumbai, Tokyo, Istanbul. The videos taken of these events have been...upsetting, to say the least.

"But in three short months, look what's happened. The Earth has begun healing. Fewer cars are driving on roads, adding less emissions to the atmosphere. Plastic is no longer being produced, no longer being added to our bloodstream. We are relying more on one another and less on globalized systems which have alienated us. How many of you have planted food for the very first time?"

Hands rose in the auditorium.

"How about woodworking? How many of you have boarded up windows and doors? How many of you have coped without internet? How many of you have sat around a fire actually talking with one another?" 

He could sense the split in the room. There was anger, tiredness, anxiety. But, at least somewhat, there was inspiration. Disaster does a strange thing to human cohesiveness. 

"The challenge for humanity, after we've expelled our invaders, is to rebuild in a way that does not invite a higher lifeform into an unbalanced system. We'll need to *choose* sacrifice. We'll need to, in some circumstances, decide against our own pleasures and indulgences to preserve our Earth."

Later, microphones were placed in the aisles and students were allowed to ask the professor questions. The first up was a young man with curly, unkept hair. 

"May family was in New York three months ago," he began. The professor smiled back sympathetically. "Fuck you!" The boy shouted. He produced a pistol from his pocket and shot the professor dead. 

There was a screaming in the auditorium before a quiet. Slowly, applause rose. 

"No traitors! No traitors!" The chant filled the space. 

The invaders noticed.
