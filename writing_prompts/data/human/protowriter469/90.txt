The unmistakable clang of metal striking metal rang through the walls, spurring me upright in my bed. In the blackness, I listened closely, hoping to the gods that it was some drunken youths sparring in the street. 

But then there were thuds and sputters; screams and barks. My body was awake before my mind, and I found myself dressing quickly, packing my personal effects haphazardly into a satchel. The sounds were getting closer now, accompanied by the distinct smell of fire consuming the thatched roofs of nearby homes. 

I flew my chest open and surveyed my small collection of treasures--more valuable to me than to any merchant, surely--and I rummaged for the pendent, throwing brass cups and emblazoned plates aside to find it tangled at the bottom of the box. 

A pounding came at my door, the sharp knocks nearly breaking it from its hinges. There were no voices on the other side. I'd heard the emperor's conquerors never spoke. Instead there was just a low humming I could feel in my bones, radiating from my doorway. From the cracks I could see the light of dancing flames and four feet standing just on the other side. 

The knocks came again, harder this time. The humming was now a murmur in my head, tunneling my vision at its edges. Had the rumors really been true? Were these really monsters sent to level the world? War has a tendency to glorify soldiers until they're either beasts or heroes by the time word gets back home. I looked up to the sword over my mantle and I wondered what words had been said of me.

I retrieved the long-retired blade and felt its weight in my hand. There was something proper about holding it, as if a limb had been reattached. My fear of what lied on the other side of my door subsided as my sword filled me with swaggering confidence. I threw my satchel over my shoulder and kicked at the door, exploding it into splinters outward, revealing my foes. 

But my newfound courage drained as my eyes fixed on what stood before me. Or, I should say, what my eyes *tried* to fix on. No matter how much I focused on the creatures before me, my eyes couldn't make sense of them. They were too close and too far; too big and too small. Their faces--what I think were their faces--filled my guts with sickness and sent a cold sheet of sweat over my skin. 

Something lunged into my stomach, doubling me over. The humming was deafening now, blotting out the screams and metal ringing from combat. Who was fighting them? How were they doing it? Even collapsed on the threshold of my house, I couldn't help strategize. An old soldier never really retires, does he? 

The monsters walked over me and began tossing my meager belongings. I heard furniture smash and watched articles of clothes fly out in front of me.  Retreat was my only option now, but my insides still reeled with eye-bulging pain and my breath hadn't yet returned to my lungs. 

I put one shaky arm in front of the other, inching into the street. Horses and men seemed to run by in slowed time, their footfalls echoing as they fled the invaders. I turned my head down the street to see what was coming. A swirl of purple clouds had formed, and black silhouettes of monsters poured from the vortex. They threw fiery torches on houses and fleeing civilians, setting the whole world ablaze around them. Clearly, their mission was not to capture resources--human or otherwise--but obliteration. Why? What was the point? 

A smaller figure walked toward me, a long staff in its hand and a hood over its head. I hid my sword behind my prone body and laid back. Possum might not be the most honorable tactic, but honor seems to be off the table tonight. 

The figure leaned down over me, and in the light of the fire I could see his face. It was just a man, deep wrinkles around his eyes and a large jewel tethered to his neck with a golden chain. He was frowning as he looked me over before his eyes spotted the pendent around my neck. The old man crouched down and felt the metal case between his fingers. 

My breath had returned, but I kept it slow and lazy. This was the critical moment, where the confident enemy shows his weakness, forgetting his mortality. I grabbed him by the glowing green stone around his neck and pulled him forward as I pushed my sword through him. 

Then I woke up, sweating profusely in my dark house. 

I pulled my blanket off my body and found a strange green glow take the room. In my hand was the green stone, still attached the golden chain. Outside there was the sound of metal clanging, getting closer. There were thuds and sputters; screams and sparks. 

A knocking came at the door.
