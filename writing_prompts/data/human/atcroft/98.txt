*(****EU****:* [*Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084726/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)*, approximately 37 minutes in (just after Kirk asks Uhura to alert Star Fleet Headquarters).)*

Nothing to do but wait on a reply, he opened the book again. A few minutes later, he snapped the book closed, unable to focus, and sat it and his bifocals on the table. Closing his eyes, that morning came back to him with more than a twinge of regret in its stark relief.

He looked up from the bed at the large windows that overlooked the bay. City lights reflected in drops of falling rain like stars moving through space. The silver moonlight made the beautiful blonde figure as ephemeral as her nightgown as she stared out, the activity of her mind evident on her features from across the room.


"Come back to bed, Carol." he said softly, trying not to disturb the magic of these predawn hours.


"Jim, what are we doing?"


"I don't know that it had a name, but I thought you were enjoying it as much as I was..."


"That's not what I meant, Jim!" she said sternly, turning to face him.


"I don't know what you mean, Carol."


"I mean you and I." she said as she charged back toward the bed, her diaphanous nightgown hugging her closely, concealing nothing.


"I figured we'd make it up as we went along," he said, sitting up in bed.


"Jim, do you expect me to follow you on assignments? Or meet up every few months when you get shore leave?" she said, retrieving her clothes from around the room.


"No, Carol. I guess I wouldn't ask--"


"Are you going to quit your career in Star Fleet? Follow me from science station to science station?" she said as she stepped into her slacks. "I know you well enough, Jim--you would hate that life. Let's face it, we're alike in that way--it's our careers that drive us."


"What are you saying, Carol?" he asked as she folded her nightgown and put it into her overnight bag.


"You have your world, I have mine. Let's call this what it was, Jim: a good time by all," she said as she fastened her tunic. "Tomorrow you leave for Enterprise, and I leave for my next assignment in a month. It's the right time. It's time for a new story."


"Carol--"


She slid on her shoes, looking over her shoulder at him. "Good-bye, Jim." she said as slid out the door.


*And like that, the thread between them was gone. It was cut.* he mused.

His trip down memory lane was dispelled by a voice over the intercom.


"Admiral Morrow from Star Fleet Command on secure channel, sir."


"Let's have 'im, Lieutenant."


"Jim, what is going on?" the friendly face on the screen asked.


"Harry, it's probably nothing--we received a garbled transmission from Carol Marcus on *Regula I*."


"Carol?" the face with the raised eyebrow asked.


"Not you, too, Harry."


"Jim, I want you to take *Enterprise* and investigate."


"Harry, it's a boat-load of.. of children... with only a few officers aboard as instructors."


"Jim, you're right--it may be nothing. But let's make sure. Her work on *Genesis* is that important."


"Harry, what exactly ***is*** *Genesis*?"


"I'll clear you for the background. Meanwhile you have your orders, Jim."


"Understood. Kirk out." He punched the intercom again. "Uhura, where can I find Captain Spock?"


"In his quarters, Admiral."


"Thank you, Uhura."
