As the tour group approached the glass-enclosed stone, their guide turned to them. "This," she began, "is our museum's pride. This appears to be one of the first tables recording the epic. As you can see below the stand is a translation of the portion of the story on this piece."

"How old is it?" one tourist asked.

"We estimate approximately 4100-4200 years, give or take. This appears to be the first tablet. This was the start."

"Why was this story written down?" another asked.

"We aren't sure if it was just to preserve the story, or if there was another reason." the guide replied.

"It would last ages. How could they know it would last this long?"

"We don't think they considered that-it was just the medium for recording. It would be some time before they considered firing tablets to make them permanent, but the conditions in that region naturally help preserve these kinds of artifacts. Now if you will follow me our next stop will be another culture growing in power at the time, Egypt."

"Miss, one last question about the tablet." a gentleman at the back of the group said. "What do *you* think was the reason it was recorded?"

"Well," she began, "I'd like to think..."

Ur-Nammu looked at his sleeping queen, Katum, as he lifted the infant Shulgi from his cradle. He carried him down the hall from their bedroom to his throne room so she could sleep in peace. He was worried-the child had kept her up so much recently he could see the strain it caused her. He propped the infant up on her throne.

"One day, my son, this throne will be yours. You will need gather wisdom and bravery together; a good ruler is a consolidation of both. Perhaps I should start now to instill those in you."

Ur-Nammu looked up from his son, calling a servant. "I need Ur-dumuzi the scribe; tell him to bring tablets." He barely noticed as Ur-dumuzi entered, taking his seat on the floor beside the throne, several tables beside him, stylus in hand.

Ur-dumuzi began to write as Ur-Nammu began. "Shulgi, my son, future King of Sumer and Akkad, today I begin telling you the story of your grandfather six grandfather's ago, Gishbilgamash. When you are older I will tell them to you in order they happened, but for now I will tell them by importance, to instill the lessons in your heart."

Ur-Nammu took a drink from a bronze cup, and began his story.

"A leader must protect those who cannot protect themselves, especially if his actions bring the dangers, even if it risks personal loss.

"Inanna came to Gishbilgamash, asking him to be her consort. Gishbilgamash refused, insisting she had mistreated her previous consorts. This enraged her, so she went to her father Anu and demanded of him Gugalanna, the Bull of Heaven. She released it on the world to attack Gisbilgamash and his kingdom.

"Gisbilgamash and his friend Enkidu saw the death and destruction caused by Gugalanna and hunted it down. Together they fought it, and Gisbilgamash struck the fatal blow. Gisbilgamash offered the Bull's heart to Shamash before resting from their efforts.

"Inanna, furious that her plan failed, stood on the walls of Uruk and cursed Gisbilgamash. Enkidu, in anger, tore the right thigh from the Bull and threw it at Inanna's face. In response to these events, Anu, Ea, and Shamash met, deciding that either Gisbilgamash or Enkidu must die as punishment. Enkidu was chosen, grew sick, and died. Gisbilgamash became inconsolab...le."

Ur-Nammu looked from the scribe to his infant son Shulgi, wondering where in the story he had fallen asleep. He looked to his scribe, who was busy writing the last of it on the tablet now in his lap. Carefully he picked up his son, taking him back into his arms. "One day, son, you will make a fine king. This in my heart I know."

Ur-dumuzi finished, signing it before showing it to Ur-Nammu. "To Shulgi, son of the king, Ur-dumuzi the scribe, his servant," Ur-Nammu smiled, nodding.

"Now, my king, if I may I will lay these tablets in the sun to dry and bring them for Shulgi when they are ready."

Ur-Nammu nodded, releasing Ur-dumuzi to take the freshly-written tablets away, and rocked Shulgi in his arms. "Yes, one day you will make a very fine king," he thought.
