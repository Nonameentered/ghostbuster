As she approached he guided her to the small table, pulling out her chair, taking the one in opposition for his own.

The glow of the lonely candle between them strained to light the room, its valiant effort dying just beyond the table--a faint, ruddy light lifting objects barely from obscurity, every movement of its flame pulling them into the light or casting them back into outer darkness.

She tried to focus on the dark figure across from her, as if it would unlock his enigmatic features. She thought she saw a dark cloud hovering over his visage; was the occasional spark the birth of thought, or the stormy evidence of a tug-of-war behind his eyes? Leaning ever so slightly into the light she smiled--and by doing so truly aiding the candle in its anemic efforts. 

He admired the warmth the candle gave her face--although some of her hair faded into the darkness of the surrounding room. Silently he wished only to lean his elbows upon the table, rest his chin upon his hands and take in this view--but neither time nor the manners of his youth could nor would permit him that indulgence.
