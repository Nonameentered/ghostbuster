"What are you now, Charlie? Seventeen? Eighteen?

"Why, when I was that age, the world was my oyster. ***Adventure called.*** And saving the world, well, ***it was something only we could do.***

"Why I remember the first time I entered this bar. Hilda, you remember that night?" he said, looking around Charlie to the bar keep tending to paying customers and ignoring him.

"That was a night to ***behold***," he said, downing another drink. "legendary." he said wistfully, a snort the reply of the bar keep. "I remember it clearly, as if it were yesterday. That was the night I defeated twelve men in combat while rescuing a lady in ***distress***. I was ***gallant***, I asked them to ***dance***. When they charged I drew my rapier, slicing the belt of the closest one. He tripped as his pants fell, taking out the one either side of him.

"Like a deer I bounded toward that wall, three more chasing me. I bounced off the wall, flipping over their backs, landing atop that table and swatting the leader with the length of my blade. Two of them struck the wall and knocked themselves cold. The leader charged at me, but I jumped, grabbing that chandelier with one hand as I knocked his hat off with my trusty sword. I swung my feet, and when I came forward hit him in the chin with my boot heel, knocking him out as he fell into a table that collapsed with him.

"By this time everyone else but the remaining six had moved to the edges of the room, hugging the walls. I--" he began, and started to cough. "Charlie, can you get us another round? Hilda," he called to the bar keep, "can I get another pint. And Charlie here, you'll be having...?" The younger man held up his hand palm out. The bar keep set down another glass and walked back down the bar. "So now, where was I.... Oh, right, hanging from that chandelier," he said, pointing this time at the one next to it. "I turned, swinging myself back and launched myself back toward the remaining company. I tucked, rolling as I landed and popping to my feet, rapier in hand.

"They were mostly untrained swine--I held a conversation with a young lady as I easily parried their thrusts. They came at me, angered, and I easily disarmed them one by one, kicking them out the door until only their leader remained. He had strength but no grace as we circled one another in the center of the room. I toyed with him until I grew tired, needing to leave (to meet the lady), when I angered him so until he charged me.

"With my cat-like reflexes, I dodged, spinning to kick him in the arse. He went through that window," he said, pointing to the right of the door, "collapsing half-in, half-out. I took my bows of the crowd before making my exit by running up his back and jumping through the window. And ah, but that girl," he said, slowly getting off his bar stool. "I'll tell you that when I get back, but right now I need to go see a man about a horse." Slowly he waddled toward the back.

Hilda approached Charlie, cleaning the bar. "Hey kid, Clancy may be a good storyteller, but otherwise he's a lyin' cheatin' bast'rd. If 'e says it's light out and the sky is norm'lly blue, ya' better make for a window to check for y'self."

"Huh?" Charlie asked.

"If tha' story 's any more bull it would moo and ther'd be one more mess in here.

"Yeah, I remember the night he first showed his ugly mug here. Was three sheets to th' wind before he e're set sail to land in this bar. Had money--then--but w's a quiet drunk. So's anyway, three members of the shor' p'trol walked in. Was some fella' here 'd jump'd ship and went native, long blonde hair and all. Clancy's 'o piss drunk th' bottom half 'is eyes is amber and 'e's sloshin' as 'e walks. Fool decides the sa'lor 's "a lady" and decides to defend 'er hon'r. Runs up, one o' th' fellas pus'es 'im back and he fell into a table, breaking it. Fool jumped onto another table, swingin' an umbr'lla like a sword and chargin' at 'em. Th' oth'r turned, and Clancy went through the window. Pass'd out. Left 'im there to sleep it off."

Hilda started to walk away, then turned back "'E didn' try to stick ya' with the tab, did 'e?"

Charlie shrugged.

Hilda waved aside. "I'll put i't on 'is tab. Like 'e'll e're pay it off."

Charlie slid off the stool, leaving as Clancy returned.

"Hilda, where'd the kid go? And another round, please?"
