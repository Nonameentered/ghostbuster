Thank you, gdbessemer. Were the mushrooms the author prepared hallucinogenic, or poisonous? (I'll leave that for the reader to decide.) I remember that SEUS felt difficult at the time because I was trying to incorporate all of the features within the length constraint.

When it comes to SEUS, (fortunately or unfortunately) I have two standing personal challenges:

1. To incorporate all of the features into the story.
2. To complete a month's SEUS series if I start one.

(You can imagine the situations that might put me into if that knowledge were to get into the wrong hands, so I'm trusting you with that information....)

To your questions (as best I can answer them):

1. **What is your favorite writing beverage?** ***question stolen shamelessly from Dee*** 

Iced tea. (I like tea in general (hot or cold), but living in Texas/the American South, cold generally rules the day. Not opposed to the occasional soft drink, coffee, or other drinks, but tea is what is generally available.)

2. **What techniques do you use to motivate yourself when you're not in the mood to write?**

That's actually a hard one. I'm still trying to find what works or doesn't. So far, it seems to depend on where in the process I am.
  

  
If I have a prompt in mind stepping away to do something else (like yard work) often seems to help. If I don't have one then perhaps I need to keep scrolling but change my criteria slightly (or look for something different, so instead of just looking for a prompt that strikes me look instead at the new prompts, something that might stretch me as far as not my prefered genre, or maybe a prompt a few days old looking back from the sub like a forlorn pet in a shelter kennel waiting for a response).
  

  
I also have a longer piece I have been working on off and on (since June 2019), which I find myself taking longer breaks from that I would like. (I'm mentioned a few of the issues I've encountered in that process both in other posts here and in comments on Discord.) 
  

  
With that one sometimes it seems I have to just step back and do something else; unfortunately it can be easy to keep doing that until I find I haven't looked at that piece over a month (or even two!). (That story isn't far from my mind most of the time, but even 21K words in sometimes it just seems like a struggle to get more of it down onto "paper". Then again, it is also my longest work so far.)

3. **Do you have a preferred writing venue?**

As far as where I write, these days it is at my desk/computer. I can't imagine myself trying to write on a phone (my hat 's off to those who can and do), and typing for me is faster than hand writing (and easier to correct!).
  

  
As far as where I post, this sub (and Discord) seem to be the only two places I post writing these days. (Currently I'm using my user-sub currently to easily find my older works. I haven't decided yet if I may post things there that are not related to this sub.)
