Thank you--I'm glad you enjoyed it.

With the constraint of trying to shove in three speakers with no dialog tags ("signposts"), I decided I needed three clearly distinct voices. It came to me that the easiest way I could make three distinct voices was to have the interviewee, one interviewer trying to conduct the interview, and one interviewer who was constantly distracted by this or that. The distracted interviewer thus provided the opportunity to try to make it a bit humorous.
