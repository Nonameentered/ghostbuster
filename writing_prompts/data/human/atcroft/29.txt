Thirty seconds of terror--   
Did I just flame out?   
Burn up on entry?   
   
My hands cold   
and shaking,   
My eyes ready   
to bug out,   
My throat suddenly   
parched,
    
And all I’d gotten out   
so far,   
The only word   
to cross my lips,   
Was “hello”.   
   
   
I stood in abject terror--   
Hoping to be floor-swallowed,   
Wishing for a mass mind-wipe.   
   
My face red   
as blood,   
My eyes filling   
like pools,   
My skin was   
aflame,
   
I felt the air go   
out of the room,   
My head began   
to swim,   
“Hi,” she replied.
   
   
Sunlight swept aside terror---   
I was floating on air,   
She smiled at me.
   
My heart flipped   
and thumped,   
My eyes drowning   
in her pools,   
My hand was   
electric,
   
Her hand felt warm   
on mine,   
Her breath soft   
and sweet,   
And oh, that giggle!
