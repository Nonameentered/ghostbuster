Wow! From details such as "The IV-line burns" because "I'm on this new medication" to his apologizing for the accident that resulted in being there, this is very nicely done all around. You obviously put a good deal of thought in, and it showed--it was a great read. The characters are very believable, and while he doesn't feel like anything is wrong, you did a good  job of making the reader (well, me, at least) feel for the poor mother.

If I had to pick any nits (and they would be small ones, not distracting from the story), it would be when the mom speaks as she initially arrives I might suggest combining those four lines into one paragraph. My first thought was that the paragraphs were a change of speaker, and I had to re-read to make sure. So instead of:
>"Sam…" I hear a familiar voice.
>
>"Sam…" The IV-line stings, my mind is a mess.
>
>"Sam, I’m here..." I screech back to reality.
>
>"Oh, Sam!" I’m hugged by who I can only assume to be an overkeen and overworked nurse. Had they had to resuscitate me?

You might instead format it like:
>"Sam..." I hear a familiar voice. "Sam..." The IV-line stings, my mind is a mess. "Sam, I'm here..." I screech back to reality. "Oh, Sam!" I'm hugged by who I can only assume to be an overkeen and overworked nurse. Had they had to resuscitate me?

Overall, a great and thoughtful read. Thank you!
