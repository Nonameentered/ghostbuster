Between raindrops and sun  
The air becomes warmer,  
Brown becomes green.  
The air becomes alive  
With the sounds of life.  
  
For animals and plants alike  
Waking from Winter's nap,  
Everywhere you look, it's there  
"Love" is in the air.  
  
Of course it is--  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My car turns sickly green,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My head stops up.  
  
Those f---in' trees,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why can't they get a room  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like anyone el--*\*A-CHOO\**
