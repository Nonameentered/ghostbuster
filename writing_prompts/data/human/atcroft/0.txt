It was mid-afternoon before I could break for lunch; as a jobler my morning had been quite busy. I sat beneath a large oak, blocking the wind with its trunk and the sun its branches. 

I didn’t expect to live forever, but I did intend to hang on as long as possible; thus my prandicle resided in the small sospital cooler I carried. The meal itself would never grace the pages of a bromograph, but it was sufficient for the day. I unwrapped a sandwich, resting it on its wrapper on my knee. After I unscrewed the cap of my thermos, I poured myself some coffee and looked at the sad, wilted lettuce poking out from under the bread.

As I took a sip from my coffee I noticed a small lizard that had jumped from the trunk to my shoulder as it crawled slowly down my arm. I smiled as I watched it.

“We’re a strange pair, aren’t we?” I said. It seemed to dodge as I moved slightly. “You have nothing to worry about from me,” I continued. I saw the intent in its eyes, moving back and forth between the lettuce as a target and me a threat. I pulled the lettuce from the sandwich. “Is this what you want? Is this what you hunt?”

I watched as its eyes followed the lettuce, and smiled. I lay the lettuce leaf on my forearm, and watched as it sniffed and started to eat. I sat the coffee beside me, and took a bite from my sandwich, careful not to disturb as together we ate our lunches in peace.
