Thank you for the feedback. I'm glad you enjoyed it!

I'm not great at trying to use consistent pace (meter? I don't know if it's the right term either, but I get your meaning). Sitting here now, does this sound better?

Ants at a picnic,&#10;  
You're everywhere I turn.&#10;  
A restaurant,&#10;  
The theater,&#10;  
A shadowy in fog&#10;  
Memory haunts just behind my eyes.&#10;  

Really do appreciate the feedback. Thank you!
