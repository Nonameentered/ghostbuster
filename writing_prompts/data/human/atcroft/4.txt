A glint of light caught my eye. I waded out from under the pier with a net to find the source. A bottle, swirling in an eddy. 

*More trash,* I thought as I lifted it from the water. 

It surprised me with its heft. I started to toss it in the bag with other trash I noticed the paper rolled up inside it. My curiosity piqued I stood there, hip-deep in the ocean with a minor mystery in my hands. It was only that evening I could indulge that curiosity.

It took some doing to remove the note from the bottle, but after removing its battered cork and fighting for some time I now had the note before me.

> To Miss Beatrice Johnson, Galmpton, Devon,
> 
> I don’t know if this will find you, but I pray it will. When all you have is hope, don’t part with your illusions. 
> 
> We are at the mercy of the currents. I should say I--Williams passed in the night. I’m alone now.
> 
> It’s been three days since that night, after we passed Miami. After our convoy was hit. The Americans--their coast was lit like Christmas. Do they not realize there’s a war on?

*Convoy? War? World War II?* I thought. I continued reading.
 
> We must have stood out against the lights on the coast--easy pickings for the Hun. I was on the deck for a breath of air, about to start you a letter. We took the first hit--I found myself in the water before I knew it. I watched as she went down by the light of fires on three other ships. No time to signal distress. No need--to stay looking for survivors would be to make themselves targets. A few minutes later the ocean was still as glass, with no trace of the convoy, the Hun, or the violent ends of four ships.
> Williams and I found each other after first light. He clung to a crate with severe burns from the explosion; I had found a large piece of debris in the night that could support a man. Between the two we could keep ourselves out of the water.
> 
> I knew Williams was in bad shape--he tried to keep a stiff upper that first day, but his moans when sleeping betrayed him. Yesterday was worse--he wouldn’t wake. This morning I found his hand on my arm, but he was gone. All I could do was say a prayer and let him slip into the deep.
>
> After the second day we were famelicose, but what could we do? We had nothing to fish with, and nothing else edible in sight.
>
> I have done my duty, but I fear my service to His Majesty George V is nearing its end.
>
> Beatrice, know that I love and miss you, and that if I do not make it my last thoughts shall be of you.
>
> Yours always,
> George


*George V? World War...I?*

I sat there, stunned by the century-old letter before me, and said a silent prayer of remembrance.
