The haze of alcohol from the hours at the tavern slowly fell as a veil over my eyes. A short cut through the park--it seemed like a good idea at the time.

Sure, there were stories. People who were going down to the store for milk or a pack of cigarettes (so it was claimed) who supposedly cut through the park but were never seen again. Everyone knew those stories were just a polite way to say they bailed on their relationships, their responsibilities.

The moon through the trees seemed to recede with every step I took, casting eerie figures beside me. Fog gave the scene an ethereal, otherworldly appearance--anything was possible. Time seemed to slow to a crawl, it felt like hours had passed since I stepped among the trees.

Have I seen that tree before? It looked familiar. Maybe I passed it a little while ago. It couldn't be, I thought, I was walking an amazingly straight line.

It struck me like an iron skillet. That tree was clearly in the wrong, it had stepped right out in front of me. As I stumbled backward shaking my head, I caught myself and continued forward. The fog became snow flakes. I shivered.

Up ahead I saw a shimmering light. It was inviting. As I trudged through deepening snow, I rubbed myself for warmth wishing I had a jacket. The last thing I remembered was knocking, suddenly feeling tired, and sinking to my knees in the snow.

"Are you okay?" I thought I imagined her. She was beauty in simplicity.

"Cutting through... the park. Trying... to go... home. Caught... in..." I said between chattering teeth.

"Here, eat," she said, placing something to my lips. I knew not what it was, just that in that moment it was the best thing I had ever tasted. "You need to stay here to recover. Sign this and you can stay as long as you need to do so." she said, laying a small contract before me.

My hands shook so my writing was almost illegible as I signed my name. I don't even remember dropping the pen.

Next I knew I was outside, the evening warm, and no sign of the little hut I found in the storm. The sounds of the city were close, as if stepping around the next tree I would find myself in a busy intersection. No idea how I got there, but a few minutes' walk found me at that familiar tavern--the only thing familiar on the street.

I waved over the bartender. "Can I get another one, please? Thanks," I said as I pulled out cigarette.

"You can't light up in here," the bartender said as he set the drink in front of me.

"Since when?" I asked.

"They passed that ordinance about 10 years ago."

"But I was here just last week...." I said.

"Bub, I've worked in this tavern for fifteen years and I never forget a face. And I ain't never seen your ugly mug before tonight."

"Place was filled with blue haze when I left then. It was the night the fog turned into snow..."

"The last time it snowed here this time of year was twenty-one years ago, the night some poor bastard disappeared. Was said he was last seen at this establishment--which didn't do us any favors. Probably skipped town. They searched for a month starting in the park, brought in canine units and everything. Hell of a mess," a regular at the end of the bar said.

"By the way, they still doing repairs over on 7th? I cut through the park to avoid that, but after this?"

"Which apartment complex?" the bartender asked.

"'Which apartment complex', he asks. Why, the only one on 9th street," I replied.

"All 9th street IS is apartment complexes," the regular replied.

"Can't be. They just finished it six months ago. First one in this part of town."

As the regulars debated my sanity (or my drunkenness, or both), a soft voice whispered over my shoulder. "It could be fae. There've been rumors they still live in the park, looking for those willing to sign contracts without reading them." 

My blood ran cold. I turned to see a waitress walking away. Before she stepped into the back she glanced over her shoulder, a chill running up my spine. Hers was a simple beauty, like I remember seeing... once before....
