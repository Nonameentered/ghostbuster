“All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” That line was never far from his mind as he resumed his nightly haunt of the library, the room that had become his growlery to exhume the ghosts of the past.

The coals in fireplace cast their pale red glow weakly, barely reaching across the hearth, oppressed by the darkness. Sitting just outside its light, he poured another glass of amber liquid and stared into the darkness with disdain at the portrait he knew stared back at him, a portrait he considered a farce. Resting the glass on one chair arm he absentmindedly slid his fingers around the cigarette smoldering off the edge of the other, pulling it to his lips. The drag he took briefly illuminated the foul look on the scarred features with a soft light; wisps of the pale blue exhaled smoke drifting into and out of view as it glided toward the mantel.

The liquid burned as it slid down his throat, a sardonic grin on his face as he remembered that time. A time when it was difficult to get more than two members of the family--if that many--in a room at the same time, the impossible portrait had been built from snapshots, its expressions of joy purer fiction than any book on the shelves. The last member of its subjects above ground, cold ashes flaked off and glided to the floor as he considered it again. Should he cover the painting? Tear the damned canvas from the wall?

Finding his decanter empty, he threw his tumbler into the darkness, ignoring its clatter. *Too much hassle and work to find a ladder and pry bar to pull it from the wall. Same hassle to put a cover over the cursed thing.* 

He considered the faces, etched in memory. In spite of their ages, each face appeared to be that of fifty. That, he supposed, was okay--at fifty everyone has the face he deserves. 

His eyes fell to where he looked back at himself from the study--a face he had not seen in the mirror since that business in Catalonia. He didn’t regret his part in it or his injuries, just that it failed. *We lost because we told ourselves we lost*, he thought.

He felt the warmth spreading through him, a yawn escaping. Beneath lids growing heavy his eyes moved to the side, where his brother would have stood. *If only that face could’ve seen fifty*, he thought. Another yawn shook him as he felt himself losing the battle with his lids. *Maybe in this dream*, he thought. The thought of seeing Big Brother again in his dreams pushed him onward toward sleep. *It would be good to see him again*, he thought. Of all the family members, there was only one he truly loved--he loved Big Brother.
