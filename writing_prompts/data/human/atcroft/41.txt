I'm glad you enjoyed the story--that's the best compliment I can receive.

I agree--it is a slow start. Unfortunately I wanted the reader to up to speed and understand the relationship between the caretaker and her charge, but you're right--I could have handled it better. (Thanks for those suggestions!) In my mind Eliza was replaying the event in her mind while in the conservatory later that evening, but that may not have been clear.

I appreciatate you not only taking the time to read it, but to comment on it as well. Thank you!
