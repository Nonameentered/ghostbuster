It was quiet as a graveyard  
As I walked over.  
  
"It's been a while, Mom, Dad,  
Oh, these are for you"  
I said as I was  
Relieved of my bundle.
  
"Sorry I wasn't able to make it in,"  
I started, but stopped  
I knew continuing wasn't worth it--  
We all knew how that argument went.  
  
"Heard it was a big deal,  
And everyone else made it in.  
How was everyone?  
The grandkids growing like weeds?"  
  
I had to chuckle  
In spite of myself.  
  
"We always did joke  
That we only saw everyone,  
That our family reunions  
Were weddings and funerals."  
  
It was a good visit--  
If a little one-sided--  
But the shadows grew long  
And a chill filled the air.  
  
"I'll try t' be back soon," I said,  
"Maybe next time I can get them to come with."  
Before turning back to my car  
I patted the cold gray stone one last time.  
  
It was quiet as a graveyard  
As I walked over.
