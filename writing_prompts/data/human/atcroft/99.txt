The moon was forthright, its solid glow a soft blanket on the campsite.

A slight breeze made the shadows from the campfire dance in a frenzy, pushing a wave of goosebumps across my skin. Every sense seemed heightened, every nerve on edge. Shadows and flame came alive.

I dropped my mess kit, startled by a fluorescent glow from my meal. 

The world added another axis to its spin. I fell toward my knees. Freefalling feels familiar. A last thought slices through my being as I fade from the world of consciousness: *I guess picking mushrooms wasn't my forte--or was it?*
