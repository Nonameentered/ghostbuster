Hey thanks! That’s great to hear. I think it usually takes about 30 mins to write a story for this sub but it’s very dependant on the style. This one took a bit longer, maybe 45 to an hour. The character didn’t have much voice (tried to keep it neutral) which helped but I was trying to hide the story and theme in the subtext (sorry if I sound pretentious) and that‘s harder for me. 

Thanks again. Do you write here?
