Death sits in an ergonomic swivel chair behind a wooden desk. He rolls his neck back and forth with a languorous *crick-crack, crick-crack.* It's perhaps one of the few pleasures Death can take in his... in his *life*? *Death*?

Two enormous, sagging paper-towers wobble on the right side of the desk. Dauntingly tall. The thought of filling them out sends a wave of stress-anger-anxiety through your new corporeal form. You had enough of that kind of bullshit when you were living and you'd rather not see paperwork ever again.

On the left side of Death's desk is a single, shorter stack with paper that has been filled in. Whatever paperwork Death is processing, it looks like a Sisyphean task.

Death dips his right index finger-bone into a well in the desk. There's a little splash of indigo ink. Withdrawing it, he begins scratching details into another sheet of paper.

"Excuse me?" you say. It's been a while since Death spoke and you're not certain you heard it correctly.

Death pauses. Looks up at you. Tilts his head with another *crick-crack.*

"I said you're free." Death's voice is like a handful of dice being rolled in a mug. "You served your sentence and you may leave."

"I'm free?"

Death waves two white fingers -- they look like anorexic mice -- towards a door behind you. "Free. You may go now."

But you don't move towards the door. Whether that's the fault of your new legs or your old mind, who can say. But the situation is overwhelming and you need to sit down and contemplate it. Not only did you die relatively (tragically!) young, but now the Grim Reaper is hinting that your life was nothing more than a punishment for some other crime.

You sink into a chair (not as luxurious, you note, as Death's ergonomic seat -- although it's silly to be jealous here) opposite Death.

Death sighs. Flicks the ink off his finger and looks at you. Death rolls his vocal-dice: "I'm trying to be polite. What I'm really saying is: *get out*. I have paperwork that will last me as many lifetimes as humanity can muster, and I would like to finish it all before the end of eternity. If it's all the same with you."

"I'm dead," you say, only starting to grasp the concept. "I'm dead, aren't I?"

Death looks at you with that familiar *are you stupid?* look. You suffered that look many times in real life, from your parents to your partner to your ungrateful children. And even though Death disguises the suggestion with his eyeless, browless face, you know he's thinking it. You'd recognise it even in the dark.

"Yes. You're dead. Congratulations. You can move on."

Unbelievable. You've suffered through a terrible life (your special other left you for your gardener -- and the kids chose to go with them. Well, they were the real weeds and the gardener did you a favour by cutting them out of your life) and now here you are, dead, and still being disrespected.

"What the hell did I do before my life to deserve that life?"

Death sighs. You imagine he just rolled a double one. Snake eyes; a venomous sigh. "I don't know. I just deal with collections and deliveries." He eyeballs the paperwork, so to speak. "And all this."

"It must have been something pretty bad to have been punished with that life."

"Not as bad as I must have done to be lumbered with you now," says Death. Well, he didn't actually say that, but he gave you *that* look.

"On the other hand," you say, "I died young. I wasn't forced to suffer for too long. So maybe it wasn't such a bad thing I did."

"Right," says Death, dipping his finger into the ink. He's ready to ignore you. But that's fine, you're more than happy to talk to people who don't listen.

You sit upright, hit by a sudden thought as hard as a metal mallet. "Wait! If that was my punishment -- life, I mean -- then what's coming up next, that must be good, right? I mean, it must be *really* good."

Death snorts.

"It must be amazing. I'm done with hell and about to hit the cool refreshing champagne pools of heaven."

"The exit is behind you," says Death. "Enjoy."

You feel elated. The stresses you brought with you waft away, they leave your body like ghosts exiting a haunted house that's coming to its demise. All that's left for you is pleasure. Not even Death having the better chair bothers you now (even though you've just died and have had quite a shock and could do with a seat, while this is all par for the course for lazy Death).

"I deserve this," you say. "Not what I had. But what I'm about to get. I deserve it!"

"I'm sure that's true," says Death.

Yes, you deserve it. Okay, you didn't live the best life -- but it was hell! Yes, you cheated on your SO before the gardener incident. And the kids didn't much like boarding school. It's true you could have been a better person, but in that late-stage capitalist society, who has time to be a better person? That's a luxury for the rich! And yes, you were quite wealthy yourself, but you weren't that type of rich. You were the still-work-hard kind of wealthy. The good kind. It was those capitalist stresses that made you beat the shit out of that homeless guy that one night after a few drinks too many. You're a good person, it's the system that pops out people like you, one after another. Choices your ass. Life's an arrow and you've all been sharpened to a deadly point.

Now though, that's all behind you. The past is a bad shit best forgotten, the future is... well, it could be anything. But it's going to be a beautiful anything. It has to be, after that.

You get up from your chair and put on a cocky smile. "Be seeing you, Death."

"Perhaps," says Death, not looking up from his paperwork.

No. Not even Death will annoy you now. Not your fault he's an unsociable asshole. You turn to the door and march at it with all the hope in the world inside your brand-new belly. What wonders wait for you beyond? Fuck you life, you think. And death.

No. Be fair. If you were Death and had all that paperwork waiting to be done, you'd be an asshole too. You'd be cranky It's this system. In reality, Death seems pretty nice. If that were you... you'd be a hell of a lot worse to people. Not torturing them per se, but pranking them maybe. Or taunting. Something light like that.

You fling open the door and step into the darkness beyond.

The door slams shut behind you.

"Hello?" you say to the darkness.

Then an eruption of lava-red. Of purple and orange spouts of fire all around you.

"Oh shit," you say, realising where you are. You turn, looking for the door. But it's gone. Of course it has. Just endless pits of sulphur and fire.

There's laughter echoing. Imps and demons and maybe even Satan himself.

"Welcome! First things first, time for for you to start the initial paperwork," says a cackling voice.

You wonder now if Death is part of you. If you were judged not by another being, but by yourself. Because that asshole pranked you alright. Just like you would have done. Free at last - ha! Life was a punishment - ha! That liar -- life was life and this is death. And now you've got an eternity here in hell to look forward to. Ha, he pranked you good.

And in a way, you've got to respect that.
