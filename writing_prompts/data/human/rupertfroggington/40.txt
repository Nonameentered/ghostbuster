The cold water rushed against my legs. Pain shot through me as my feet and ankles absorbed the water.

I had no idea if this would kill me or if it would do anything good at all. But I waded deeper, as my body absorbed more and more of the salty water. Soon I was twice my size and width. Then four times. Then ten times. And still I grew. Wider and taller, as if I was drinking up the shore itself.

The pain tore at me as if I was ripping myself in half, as if my skeleton was tearing itself free of its skin.

I absorbed enough water to be a hundred, then maybe a thousand times my size. I was a sponge that walled off the ocean to the beach, and still I grew and rose into the air.

By the time the great wave came thundering I was unable to move or think or do anything but exist as a kind of organic wall.

But I was every bit as big as the tsunami.

It collapsed into me, buffeting me back against the low rocks of the cliff, but unable to get through me. Its roar was the angry frustrated scream that had been building up inside of me for the last few years. It was the sound of my sorrow at the loss of my mother. It was all the pain I’d been holding.

Finally, the wave withdrew. When it struck again it was with far less force.

I lay on the beach for many weeks afterwards, slowly shrinking as the water inside of me evaporated.

Every day people from my town would visit and lay gifts by my swollen head. I was still unable to talk, but I could think a little. And I thought how lucky I was. Had always been.

And every day my father came and sat by me. He’d tell me how proud he was of me. How proud they’d both been of me, even before my powers. That they’d never stopped being proud. They were just sorry I was suffering and that they didn’t know how to help.

He told me stories I’d forgotten from when I was a child. Of my mother’s smile when I’d been born. As full as the moon.

”She knew you loved her very much,” he said. “Even at the end.”

I think I must have known that already but hearing it from my father melted the sheet of ice I’d been carrying around with me for the last five years.

I promised myself that I’d waste no more of my life on bitterness. You never know how long you have left to treasure the things that matter. Now I would treasure everything important to me as fiercely as a dragon.
