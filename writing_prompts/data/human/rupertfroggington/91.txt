Erik was reasonably handsome for a bandit, the princess thought. Except for his nose that looked like a bulb of garlic. Otherwise, handsome. His eyes were like a painting of the sea, deep green waves flecked with darkness. His cheekbones were sharp enough to cut fruit on. And his face was currently flushed red enough to melt an iceberg.

“It’s much easier with a metal pick,” Erik said. He’d jammed the lock on the door and they were both now stuck in the dungeon’s cramped cell. “Damn bastard wooden picks — it was just for demonstration. I was just demonstrating to you. It wouldn’t have happened out in the real world.”

The princess lay back on the straw and gazed at the ceiling. There was a weather system down in this dungeon; when the air cooled even slightly, like on a night like this, condensation would form and drip from the stone above. Slowly the straw of her bed would go from damp to soaked.

“You need to suck the pick out,” she said lazily.

“What do you know about it,” Erik snapped.

She raised her brows.”Fine. Do whatever.”

Black spores of mould caked the rock above her. If she squinted it looked like pretty little stars. Like she was outside. Not that it bothered her much being in here. She’d spent half her life locked in a tower, and although the level of luxury had significantly dropped, she couldn’t turn her nose up at this change of scenery.

Erik teased two further thin sticks into the side of the lock, attempting to pincer the offending pick out. “Almost… Easy… See this is how you— Oh god damn it!”

“Should I be worried that you locked yourself in here with me?” the princess asked. “You know, as a girl.” But she closed her eyes and chewed lazily on a length of straw.

”I didn’t lock myself in with you!” He ran a hand through his greasy hair. “Well, I mean, I did. But I didn’t mean to.”

”Oh, I’m sure you didn’t. You know, the castle mage back home says accidents are never really accidents.”

”It was an accident! I only came down here cause I know how boring it gets in the dungeon.”

The princess opened an eye. “Yeah?”

”Yeah. See, I wasn’t always a bandit. Wasn’t till I lost a wager that I ended up in a cell like this.“

She sat up now, a little more interested in her garlic-bulbed captor. Or cell-mate. Could be either.

“What were you before this?”

”I was a fighter.“ He turned to face her and gave two quick jabs into the air, accompanying them each with a “whoosh” sound. “And a damn good one at that. Won a lot of money.”

”So what went wrong?” asked the princess, now almost intrigued.

He shrugged. “They found out I was fixing the matches.”

She laughed.

”Ah, it’s not funny.“ He touched his nose. “I got a real beating from a few people after they got wise. Took all my money and everything. Then I couldn’t pay back my loan, and it snowballed from there.”

She felt a little bad about his nose now. Imagined it purple and broken and not setting right. But she said, ”Well, if you came here to entertain me, you’ve succeeded.“

He flushed with anger. Then it faded as quickly as a dream leaving only a smile behind. Like sand blowing away to reveal a long lost artefact. “Back when I was locked in the dungeon there was a guard that did me some kindness. Came down and taught me a few skills, like lock-picking.”

*Shame you didn’t pay attention*, she thought — but she somehow bit her tongue.

”So you thought you’d come pay me some kindness? Pay it on, as it were?”

He nodded. “And look how that’s ended for us. It’s like my mother always said, kindness is for fools.”

With a lazy sigh she got to her feet and walked to the lock, placing an inspecting eye by it. “Hmm.”

”Hmm?”

”Hmm.“ She moved her mouth over the lock and sucked hard. Then she turned to Erik and spat out three little sticks, one at a time.

His mouth opened agape, but if words were intended to be spoken they must have become lost in his throat.

She then rummaged in her hair until she found a copper clip. The princess bent it straight then wiggled it into the lock. It clicked loudly and the door swung open.

”Shall we?” she said.

”But...“

”Years locked in a tower. You learn a few things. Like how to sneak out at night.“ She smiled. “Even princesses need a bit of fun from time to time. Now, are we going or not?”

”You… you could have left at any time?”

”I suppose. I fancied being rescued though.”

Erik cough. Regained some composure. “Yes, well. I uh…”

”You made me smile. It’s been a long time since I smiled. That’s a rescue all of its own.”

Erik blushed as he walked up to the door, to her. “They’ll kill me if they find out I let you go.”

”There’s a reward waiting for you at the castle — for the hero who rescued me. And you’ll be safe enough there, I think. Besides, you couldn’t really stop me.”

It took him a moment before he could say anything. When he finally did, it was with another broad smile on his face. “Thank you, princess.”

”It’s Lara,” she said. “Call me Lara.”

Side by side Lara and Erik crept through the dungeon and out into the twilight.
