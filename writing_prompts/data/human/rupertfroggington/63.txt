She sat opposite me, this curious girl. She wore a pleated green skirt, part folded beneath her, part bunched up on her lap. Her cream blouse matched a cream hat, complete with a backwards-angled feather. She was almost too well put together for a New York hipster, but what else could she be?

We’d been watching each other for a while as we chugged along beneath the city. I’d glance away but when I’d return, drawn back by the charming outfit and pretty face, she’d still be looking at me.

I wanted to say, Hi. I wanted to say something cheesy, to tell her she had a real timeless beauty about her. Classy.

And she’d say: What took you so long to come over and say that?

I’m nervous, I’d admit. I’m not usually good at this. Even when I really like someone, I find it hard to strike up a conversation. Usually I’d miss my chance. Ten out of ten times I’d miss it. But somehow with you… it was different.

She’d tilt her head just slightly. *How?*

I don’t know, I’d say. I guess I just knew that I couldn’t let you get off this train without saying something.

&#x200B;

The train jerked to a halt. The doors hissed, passengers left and passengers boarded; coffee and sweat swilled the air, mixed with sharp, aggressive aftershave. Men in pale brown suits sat either side of her and she suddenly looked like a patch of grass in a growing desert.

She had beautiful green eyes with flakes of brown. Like copper that had been left out and weathered over many year, so that a thin layer of patina had formed over them. A hint of a long history.

She never blinked. For all the time I watched her, she never blinked.

&#x200B;

I’m glad you did, she’d say. I mean that I’m glad that you came and said hi to me.

Oh yeah? I’d reply, suddenly cool, suave. I’d vaulted over my initial fears and landed in the confident territory that I always knew waited on the other side.

Of course! she’d said. I don’t just stare at anyone, you know?

I don’t come talk to just anyone.

Aren‘t you going to ask about my outfit?

Why would I? It suits you. What else is there.

I’m out of time, she’d say. Like a confession.

Out of time?

I’m off at next stop. Next time don’t wait so long.

My stop would still be a while away at that point. But I’d take my chance for once. I’d tell her this is my stop too — or at least today it is.

My mind fast forwards through our first date. A night an opera and she’s dressed as she is, just right. Just perfect. And I don’t even like the opera — or at least, I don’t think I would — but I love it that night. Our second date is drinks. Third is bowling. She asks me about kids and I think that I’ve never wanted them before but the weird thing is maybe I’m changing my mind. She laughs. She says that’s a question for the future, don’t worry. We’re at the start of something long. An adventure.

&#x200B;

I looked away from her. My cheeks were burning. Why, I wondered, was she really looking at me? I wanted to say hi — more than I wanted anything else in the world. And what would it cost me to say hello?

But what if she was looking at something on me? Was she looking in judgement? Unable to tear her eyes away from my acne or my bad hair day or anything else. Her eyes lured by some freakishness she’d discovered, that I hadn’t even known about myself?

We pulled to another stop. The girl got up, straightened her dress. She flashed me a last smile.

I managed to smile back but nothing else.

And then she was gone.

I imagined running after her, almost falling out onto the platform, shouting: Hey, wait a minute! Can we talk, just for a moment? We might miss something good if we don’t.

&#x200B;

Then the door shuts.

The train pulls away.
