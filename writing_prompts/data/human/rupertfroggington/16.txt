The trench is death, it’s thick mud up to his knees, dead rats floating, the ground trembling as shells divot the earth. Martin’s seventeen and his breath is whiskey. He tries to force his thoughts to his mother, to birthdays, to being anywhere other than here. But his mind is an ever-shuffling deck of tarot cards, a mess of meaning and images: home then horror then home then horror. No focus, no order.

Three minutes prior he saw a bullet tear through the tin-can helmet of his best friend, whose lifeless body then toppled slowly and sank into the sludge. As if his friend had melted away into the rotten earth.

He taps his flask against his sweating lips and the last drop of whiskey crawls onto his tongue. Not enough nectar to sting, not enough to bring the haze of relief that has kept him somewhat sane for the last three months.

“Martin!” yells a hoarse voice. “Get ready, we’re going in sixty seconds.

*Going*.

Yes. They are going. Not just over the top but leaving this existence entirely. Going into the forever blackness.

He whispers a prayer but not to god, at least not to the god he’s been brought up to believe in. That belief has bled away with the thousand deaths he’s witnessed. Instead he prays to something else, anything else, that might help him in this battle. To the god of war, if there is one.

For a second he pauses as his vision flashes white. As if he’s opened his eyes for the first time in his life, seen real daylight that is too bright for mortal eyes. And framed in the brightness, in the whiteness, is a frail silhouette.

Thirty seconds pass. His vision is sludge and death again. He smells gunpowder and faeces. Whatever he thinks he saw, it is gone.

He steps back, takes a sharp breath.

Something touches his leg. Something below, in the mud. Instinct takes over and he drives his bayonette into the darkness. Doesn’t even consider the possibilities of it being anything other than a rat.

“Go! Go!”

Martin doesn’t move even as voices yell at him.

Around him, men drag themselves out of the trench. They scream, charge, shoot. Die. Martin vaguely hears their screams as machine gun bullets bite into them, woodworm into trees.

It’s not that he’s a coward. Not that he’s afraid of this death — he’s known it coming for a long while. It’s just… his legs won’t move.

He’s watching the mud in front of him. A bubbling patch of dark liquid. As if something huge and ancient is stirring in a sea bed, rising, rising…

He’s watching, transfixed, terrified, as his friend’s head rises out of the slush. Then shoulders and torso. Blood and mud ooze out of the hole in his head.

A while later, an enemy solider leans over the lip of the trench. He sees Marin and shoots.

Martin barely notices. He’s not hurt. The wound in his chest is already healed.

His friend looks up at the solider.

Grins.

Leaps.
