“I’m in no position to make a deal like that,” said the first demon that I encountered. “No matter how much I desire your soul.” Five forked tongues emerged like eels from the five mouths above its chin as the demon looked me over.

We were in a dim, damp cavern. A vast rock plinth sat in center of this cave — and on it, something blacker than the darkness. Something that looked organic, like a rotten heart, only it wasn’t beating.

”Then I’ll remain dead,” I said. I didn’t say it sadly nor with anger, just as a statement of fact.

“Deeper,” said one of its mouths, as the tongues in the others retracted.

”You must travel deeper for such a request to be met,” said the next mouth.

“I do not have the power to grant such deals.“

”But others do.“

”If you can reach them,” said the fifth.

The demon pointed to a descending tunnel where shadows rustled like leaves, shadows that morphed on the rock walls into snakes that snapped their black teeth as I walked past. They didn’t scare me, however — how could any danger scare the already dead?

The second demon‘s face was familar. An ex-girlfriend, my first love. But then her face warped into a teardrop of skin and fell from the demon’s head. Now the face of my father was uncovered and being worn by the creature. For a while I stared as forgetten memories stirred up in my mind as if by a breeze, memories of a man who had died when I was only six. Of being thrown into the air… caught. Peals of laughter.

My father’s face drooped, fell, splashed on top of the previous face.

And now it wore a teacher’s face — an old English teacher from a class I failed. I’d forgotten all about that.

I took a long breath. What can scare the dead? Perhaps this face-wearing demon was the answer.

”I have come to make a deal,” I said. “For my eternal soul, or whatever else I can offer you.”

“And in return?”

”My life.”

The demon’s eyes widened as it shook its head. “I do not have that power, although I have more power than the upper demons.”

”Are there any that do have such power?”

”Perhaps.”

It pointed down. Its face dripped a final time and I saw my son’s gentle features revealed.

Quickly, my stomach roiling, I walked on.

The third and final demon moved as I did. As if there was a dark mirror between us. Its actions repeated my own.

”I was told you could give me my life back,” I said.

The demon mimicked my movements but it said nothing. I watched it smile sadly. It’s — my — face pale and pallid from the months alone in my home.

After my son’s death, my wife and I weren’t able to look at each other. It wasn’t that we blamed each other but that we blamed ourselves. That we couldn’t stand the other to look at us because we could feel the crushing weight of our own culpability — whether deserved or not — in the other’s eyes.

And it wasn’t either of our faults. Not truly. It was our genes that had caused the problem. But how could one blame themselves for their genes?

Yet we did.

I still do.

After my wife left, I found anyone looking at me dredged up the same feelings of guilt and shame. So I stopped letting people see me.

”The other demons,” I said. “They told me you could give me my life back. That I could live again if I made a deal with you.”

The demon was crying now. I felt my own cheeks but there were no tears on them. The demon wasn’t mirroring me, instead it was crying for me.

”Please,” I begged.

I thought of the first demon and the black heart it was protecting. I thought of the second and the faces that dripped down from it.

Then I looked at third, the demon weeping for me, the only one of them who could help me.

“Please,” I said again.

It pointed at its tear-stained cheeks. It sniffed and cried and shook. And there was something so sad and pathetic about the sight that I began to cry too. I was crying for this wretched demon. The first tears I’d cried since my wife had left me.

Tears not just for my son, or my wife, but also for me.

I sat for a long time with the demon as we watched each other cry.

Perhaps I had given it what it had needed, I thought, and in return it was giving something to me.

Eventually, I got to my feet and began the long walk back to the surface.
