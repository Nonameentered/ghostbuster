Usually I’ll pants it — I’ll open the prompt and try a paragraph and see how it feels. If it’s got potential then I’ll run with it. Otherwise I might try another approach. Or else shrug and close it down. Sometimes I do plot it out in my head before I start (especially if I won’t have a chance to write straight away) but not as often. Prompts are a bit of fun for me and I don’t want to spend too long on them. But we’ve all got different goals and I think those goals define how we approach prompts, so I’m looking forward to reading more answers to this.
