Sounds like you got solid advice about writing other pieces before you start on your passion piece. Reading is a massive part of writing (imo) so you’re doing great on that front by the sounds of it.

Amazing how many great stories and songs have come to people in dreams.

Thank you for the kind words! I think you‘re underselling yourself but I appreciate it all the same :)  If you ever submit something here or nosleep and are after any feedback, send me a message!
