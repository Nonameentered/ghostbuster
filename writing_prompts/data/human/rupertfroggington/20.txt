”We’re going to die, aren’t we?” Paul said.

”No! Of course not.”

A distant scream rattled the air like a pane of glass.

“Help! Help—“

Silence reigned once more.

Erika took her little brother’s cold hand and clasped it between hers. Moonlight pooled in the tears on his cheeks like tiny golden coins. His breath wheezed out in puffs of white. A protective instinct screamed inside her, gripped her heart.

”At least we’ll see Mom again,” said Paul.

”We’re going to be okay,“ Erika said, voice insistent. But lies wouldn’t protect them. She knew that.

Paul was twelve now. Their mother had died when he’d been six, before any of this, to a rare cancer more often seen in certain animal species than in humans.

“We’re going to be fine,” she said.

They sat on ashpalt behind a makeshift barricade, a woven wooden knot of chairs and tables, sleepers and planks. Of anything they locals had been able to gather. A hundred or so people now sat together in silence, not moving, as if the gaze of Medusa had brushed over them.

They were going to die and everyone knew it. To zombies, of all things. Like they were in some cringe-inducing horror movie, Erika thought. To god damned zombies!

At the start, back when communication and electricity and all the rest of the infrastructure they had all taken for granted had still been up, she’s laughed at the news and checked the date to see how early in April it was. Surely it had been a hoax. You weren’t allowed to call them zombies, the broadcaster had said — it was considered hateful to these sort-of-still-living people. It had to be a hoax.

It hadn’t been.

It was an engineered virus. Possibly released as a weapon by another country, possibly escaped from a lab within America. Erika had no real idea, and at this point who cared?

Another scream. It might as well have been a bullet or explosion. Then a broken window, not far away.

Erika let go of her brother and took hold of her pistol.

The zombies weren’t after brains — or not *just* brains. They were after nutrition. They were after meat.

“Jesus,” said a bearded man a few meters always. He stood on tiptoes looking over the barricade. The baseball bat in his hand began to shudder. “Jesus. There’s an awful lot of them.”

Paul looked at Erika with eyes like big green jewels. The birthmark on his neck glinted in the moonlight. The mark was tinted green like his eyes, it was hard and raised off the skin ever so slightly. Their mother had possessed a similar birthmark, only on her arm, as did a few others in the village. An looking odd mark that would get Paul teased at school but that Erika loved. It was ancestory. Paul was a living connection to their mother and to the past.

More people stood.

”Shoot the bastards!” yelled someone. And so they did.

The roar of gunfire was deafening.

”Stay sitting,” said Erika, staring at her own pistol. She got up and found a crack in the barricade between two chairs. It took her eyes a moment to adjust, to see the thousands of staggering figures on the road, layers upon layers of them, slowly but inexorably trudging forward. She watched as bullets ripped into them and blood spattered. But they no longer used the blood and the bullets either wedged in their bodies or exited through their rotting flesh. Either way, not one zombie fell.

“Keep firing!”

They all knew weapons were useless. But what else did they have?

Erika aimed her gun through the looking-hole. Fired. She thought she might have hit one but it didn’t do anything if she did.

Paul was up next to her now, watching.

”I said to stay seated,” she yelled. Tears were streaming her face now. Her words, although she was sure they had left her throat, made no sound under the gunfire and screams.

The horde tore at barricade, ripping it apart like they’d soon render the villager’s flesh.

”I’m sorry,” Erika said. To the deafened silence. To her brother. To herself. “I lied earlier. We’re not going to be okay. I can’t protect you.”

Paul stared up at her, a strange expectant look in his eyes. A smile, even. As if he thought his sister suddenly held the answers to this mess and was somehow about to deliver them from it.

“Paul?”

Then the moonlight was sliced in half by two great blades, or something like blades. Shadows dropped like a theatre curtain over the barricade.

Erika turned to see the beast’s bejewelled belly as it fell towards the barricade. Saw the green scales that armoured it glitter. Flame fell like a waterfall from the creature’s snout, blue and white and as destructive as nature. The flames fell upon the horde.

Then the horde fell upon themselves.

Ash.

Smoke.

Silence. Silence of a different kind. Silence that could one day be filled with the sounds of hope.

”What the…” said Erika.

The dragon was gone into the blackness.

The zombies were altogether gone.

Erika was still alive, and so was Paul.

Paul searched the sky hoping for another look at the great beast, as Erika stared at his neck, at his birthmark, and in it she imagined she saw a glimpse of their mother, and grandparents, and great grandparents, and far, far further back.
