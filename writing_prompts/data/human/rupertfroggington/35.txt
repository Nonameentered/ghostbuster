I think some of the writers here inspire me a lot. Knowing they wrote here, or write here, and seeing the quality of their work makes getting to their level seem somewhat achievable. Writers like canadianmongeese especially, but so many others too, like fifteenminutestories, ecstaticandinsatiate, ta account, writteninsanity... The list goes on and on and on...
