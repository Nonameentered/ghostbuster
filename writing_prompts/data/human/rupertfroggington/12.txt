“We let it get out of hand,” he said. They sat next to each other on a heap of rubble, of bodies and brick and fallen trees, overlooking a sludged river.

She slapped her heel into the dirt and a whirl of dust wrapped around her shoe. “I didn’t mean to kill them all.”

He let out a long breath. ”I didn’t mean to let them all die.”

A rat scampered over a fallen pharmaceutical sign, a chunk of rotting fruit in its mouth. She looked up at the permanently greyed sky — as if they were in a shaken snow globe that refused to settle — and wondered if even rats would survive much longer.

She had altered the asteroid‘s trajectory. Imagine his face, she’d thought, when he woke up to see that huge rock hurtling towards earth, eclipsing the sun. That’d wet his pants, so to speak. It would get him back for the utopian hell-scape she’d woken to a week before — where crime had been eradicated and if anyone so much as thought a bad thought, he’d imprison them. He’d reveresed their situation, turned himself into the villain but gaslit the world into thinking he was still the hero. And she, well, she was out of business.

The asteroid changed everything once more. He couldn’t control billions of terrified people, people who thought they were about to die. What threat did he have that was worse than the end of times?

He, of course, had a level of telekinesis. He would be able to turn the asteroid away. They both knew that.

However, his idea for revenge was a game of chicken. No, he wouldn’t waste his energy giving in to her little asteroid prank. Let it come! She’d give up first, she’d be the one to bat it away and weaken herself for a while.

Let him…

Let her…

”So what now?“ he said.

She sighed and got down onto her knees. She picked up a brick and placed it on top of another. Then a third on top of that. Like Lego.

“You want to rebuild? When most of the earth has been destroyed? You do know all the people are gone, right? We let them all die.”

”I know. But we’re still here. We have forever to sulk in the remains of civilisation.”

He thought a while. Of their experiments with DNA. Wondered, if in another hundred or thousand or hundred thousand years, they might be able to bring humanity back.

And if they could, then humanity would need somewhere to live. To feel safe.

He took a long breath then joined his sister. Took a brick and placed it to the side of hers. No mortar. No measurements. Symbolic at best.

“It’ll take a long time,” he said.

She nodded.

They had worked against each other for only a short time and had caused all this. Had wrought the end of everything.

So perhaps, working together for a much longer period, they could at least begin something good.
