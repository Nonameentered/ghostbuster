Alan woke on a white-sand beach near to a couple of padlocked suitcases he vaguely recognised. The sun sizzled high above the ocean. A solitary cloud rested in the sky.

Alan forced himself up and stumbled over the sand until he found a rock blunt enough to bash the padlocks open with. He did all this automatically, an act of preservation.

Then, carefully, he removed the soggy banknotes from inside the suitcases and laid them along the rear of the beach, placing a pebble on each to keep them down. Not that there was much of a breeze. He did this for a couple of hundred notes before lying down and falling into a deep sleep.

&#x200B;

Alan woke to rain.

It took a moment to remember why he was on a beach. Then, “Shit!”

He scrambled to his feet but could barely see the banknotes in the dark. He could hear them shivering though, slapping against the downpour. At least he was near them.

*Okay, now what?* he wondered. *I can’t be a human shield for this many of notes. And besides they’re already soaked. I might as well be trying to keep the ocean dry.*

He stood still for a moment, dripping, listening to the patter of rain on money.

*They’ll dry once it’s over,* he figured. *Anyway, so what if I have to pay an island boatman with soggy dollars to get me out of here? They’re dollars all the same.*

If there was a boat on the island.

*Where had that thought come from?*

Other unwanted thoughts followed: Or if there’s a man. Or anyone at all on this fucking rock.

He slapped his cheek. Then tilted his head up and opened his mouth. Lapped the rain like it was champagne. Licked it off his lips along with a muzzle of salt.

God, he’d been thirsty — and he’d only just realized how thirsty.

*And what about when the rain stops and you’re thirsty again? Going to wait for the next storm to brew you up a nice cool cup?*

He didn’t know. Hadn’t thought that far ahead.

*How long’s it going to be until the next rainfall?*

A while, he guessed. Could be days.

*So what do we do then, Alan? Come on, you’re the genius businessman, after all. Time magazine said so.*

He thought about it like starting up a business. Bottled water. Only this business he’d start without a loan from his parents. He headed down to the beach, rain pelting him, his shirt and pants slicked to his skin like paint.

There were a handful of plastic bottles lying around. The sell-by-date on one read June ‘84. It was missing its top half and the plastic that remained was cloudy brown. Still, he dug a little ditch and placed the half-bottle snuggly inside, allowing it to collect up rainfall without tipping over.

Alan stood and watched it slowly fill. It was all he could do. Finally he picked it up and drank it all back.

He made little ditches for five more bottles and two wide bits of plastic that he couldn‘t identify but looked sturdy and round.

Then he left the beach and stood in tree cover behind it. He imagined mangroves and crocodiles and disease ridden insects lurking just feet away. But it was either wait in the darkness of the trees for the rain to pass, or wait on the beach where he might freeze to death.

At least a crocodile would be fast.

Lightning forked open the sky. The island flared white.

His heart beat hard.

Like it had beat on the plane.

He remembered it now. His own private jet. Luxury in the sky, heading to an island — but not meaning for it to be this one. A business trip. Then there had been a crack, like lightning only not. And then a wing was dangling. An engine churning red fire as it spun.

He’d stumbled his way towards the cockpit. “You fucking better land this safely or—“

Or he’d do what? They were both equal then, Alan and his pilot, equal in that moment just prior to death. Where money and rules and bosses didn’t matter. Maybe only God did, if there was a God.

”Strap in, now!” commanded the pilot.

He’d done just that.

The plane had screamed. Or he had.

Then it slammed hard into the water and his memory went no further.

The sun returned by morning. It pried open the clouds and smiled down on Alan. He‘d spent a night shivering in the trees, always hearing a snake hissing just to this side, or just above him. But maybe it was the wind rustling leaves. Either way, he was still alive.

Now he stood on the beach and let the sun warm him.

Four of his containers held water. One had tipped over and two must have had holes. Still, not too shabby, he thought. As far as start-ups go, this was a mild success.

He realized he was proud of himself. Hadn’t felt that little prod to the chest in a while.

His stomach rumbled. Now he just needed to open a food stand and he’d be quite the success story. *Billionaire tycoon spends life accused of getting lucky, starts over with scratch, comes out good. Proof was in the pudding all along.*

He took a swig of water. Looked at the dollars pinned beneath stones. Laughed.

”Unfucking believable,” he said. Tried to remember why he’d dried them the first time around.

He needed to find food soon. And a fresh water supply. He’d have to look around the island, see if anyone else was on it. He didn’t think anyone else was around though. Had a feeling. Could even see himself cutting off his feet and chewing them for calories.

”Or I find food. I fish. I climb a fucking tree, how about that?”

He inhaled the warm ocean air. Took another deep breath. His legs tingled and he felt a little calmer. His mind went to work, to commitments he was probably missing this very moment.

Yesterday it would have been the end of the world. Today, missing a few meetings didn’t seem to matter very much.

Then Alan thought two more things:

*Everyone will think I’m dead.*

and

*Everyone might as well be dead to me.*

He sat on the beach and thought both ideas over. Chewed on them. Smiled at the two-ended liberation.

He got to his feet and walked to the money patch. Picked up the dollars one by one. Wrapped them tight around the pebbles.

Then, accompanied by a scream, he threw the dollars into the sea. Some sunk instantly, others skimmed towards the golden horizon.

Sometimes he yelled a name. His ex-wife’s. His business partner’s. His parents’.

Alan’s own name, he yelled last and loudest.

Then, once all the money was gone, the man left the beach and headed to the trees.
