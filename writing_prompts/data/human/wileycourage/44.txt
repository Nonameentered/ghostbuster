I am a camera with its shutter open, quite passive, recording, not thinking.

There’s no one behind me.  No one to tell me when to stop, what light to capture out of the background noise.  No mere sojourn, but a perpetual prison.  I record nothing.  I couldn’t bear to.

My sweetheart, my only solace in hell.  You are the only thing that can save me now.  You and her.  You and her.  I haven't been telling you the truth.  They aren't telling you the truth.  We aren't winning.  There can be no victory from something like this.

Bombs explode around the trench, sending clumps of mud, dirt, and rocks flying high only to rain down on our helmets like hail.  Clink, clank, thud.

The deafening roar of enemy artillery hasn’t ceased, not for a second for an entire week. For seven days, I’ve thought I was sure to die.  It’s as though I am held at knifepoint, wondering when the fatal slash will come.

The stress of it all has broken me, my dear.  I stare blankly at my fellows, few I know.  I am so fortunate to have lived long enough that most of my comrades are dead.  Their faces are now the only things I fear; they stain the backs of my eyes.  Goosebumps of anticipation no longer raised on my arms.  Fear, panic, trauma, I am numb to it all.

I have a job to do.  A simple task.  Follow commands.  The regiment depends on the strict order and a stroke of blind fate to survive.

I dreamed once of writing to you, telling you of my valorous deeds, of triumphs, of surmounting dread to accomplish great things.  I would spare her the dirty truth, I thought I’d tell you everything that has happened to me has been amazing and surprising instead of what it is.  I can’t bring myself to lie.  I’ll let the censors remove the truth.

Some fools were homesick for everywhere but here.  They dreama different posting will lead to different outcomes, different fortunes.  They wouldn’t.  We are all of us doomed.

I am a weapon in the hands of those behind me.  Maybe merely a bullet.  Ammunition to be spent.

Their flares are going up now.  Pulsing and flashing in crimson, washing the ground in their terrifying glow.  My pocket sundial says that battle is near.

Once more I must go over the top.
  Take care of our child, John.  Live for her.

If only I could say that I turned away from the flashing red lights and hurried to our house.
