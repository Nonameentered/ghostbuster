"Your mother and I love you and Alice very much.  We love each other and we're always going to stay together, please believe me, but honey, we're going to have to move.  Tonight."

"Daddy is misunderstood," Mom followed up immediately.  The government is sending bad men to get us all.  They'll take you away from us.  We can't let them.  We have to be quiet and hide.  Ok, sweetheart?"  Anne smiled just like Robert had.  "He just had to do it, and I would never, ever leave him.  I love him too much."

"Why?  I won't go!  I don't want to go!  What did he do?  Why can't we stay?  Who are the bad men!"

"Settle down, son," Robert commanded.

"No! No!" Sid screamed and screamed.

Robert pulled Sid out of his seat, took his hand and lead him up the stairs to his room without looking back.  "Pack."  He handed Sid a duffel bag, shut the door.  "Please, son, understand we have to do this.  Your mother and I have to protect this family."

Sid grabbed a pen from his desk and scribbled furiously over the words in the leather-bound book.

Sid fell asleep hugging the journal tightly and crying.  He awoke to his father placing him in bed.

"Dad?"

"How are you doing, son?"  Robert sat on the edge of the bed gently.

"I miss Mom.  I wish we could have her back and everything could be like it was."

Robert stroked Sid's hair.  "Me too, Sid-man."

"Dad?  Have you and Mom ever lied to me?"

"What?  Why would you ask me that?"

"Well, could Momma have stayed with us?"

"What do you mean?"

"When she died.  Did she have to die?"

"Son, we've talked about this.  You and Mr. Gideon talk about this every week.  Don't you?"

"No, I mean could you have saved her?"

Robert teared up and shook his head "no" while looking at the floor.

"Could you have saved her?"

"Maybe.  But, son, she had cancer."

"Murderer!"

"Where did you learn that word?"

"From Mom!"

"You shouldn't talk to me that way.  You've never acted like this.  What's going on?"

"I want to be happy, dad.  That's all I want for our family to be happy.  After Mom died everything is different I hate it.  Can't we all be together again?"

"I don't think so, son."

"I have this book, Dad.  Whatever I write in it becomes true.  It's magic.  Look, try to take it from me."  Sid held the journal out to his dad who tried to take it pulling his skinny boy along with it each time.

"What the hell?" Robert muttered.

"Watch, Dad."

Sid opened the book to the very first page again, showing Dad his scribbled notes.

"Oh son.  Oh, son.  I'm sorry.  Come here."

"No, let me write more and show you."

*A bowl of red skittles on my bedroom desk.*

Both father and son looked to the small wooden desk against the wall opposite Sid's bed and saw a white porcelain bowl filled with only red skittles.

Wide-eyed, Robert looked into his son's blue eyes and said, "There's only one thing I want.  One thing that will get you the happy family you want.  It won't be everything, but you have to learn at some point, son that every action has a consequence and that some things come at a cost."

Sid only nodded and looked gravely at the older man, his idol.

"Write what I tell you, will you?"

"Yes, Dad."

"I'm so sorry.  You have to trust me.  Some day, your mother will explain everything.  I promise this is the only way.  I'd give anything for you to have her back, for your sister to have her.  Do you trust me?"

Sid couldn't hold back his tears and wiped them repeatedly into his shirt sleeves.  He implicitly understood what was to come even if he could not process it.

Sid obeyed his father and wrote out the sentences word by word.

"Before you write this next part, I have to say goodbye, Sid."

Sid sniffled and gulped.  "Bye, Dad.  I love you."

"Love you always."

As Sid wrote the last words his father dictated, a tear dripped down onto the page.

Robert was gone.  A cry came from the nursery and the sound of his mother singing a lullaby.  Sid tip-toed out of his room and down the hall peeking in on his infant sister being rocked to sleep in his mother's arms.

She looked over Alice to Sid and smiled warmly before smacking her lips together in a kiss.  "Your Dad would be so proud of you," she whispered.

Sid shook his head and winced in pain at the thought of his yet incomplete family.

He slinked back to his room and into bed and opened the journal again.  He looked at his father's words filling the bottom half of the first page and began scribbling.
