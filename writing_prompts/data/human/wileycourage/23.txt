"You wouldn't fucking dare!" I screamed at my so-called father.  He's more a tyrant, and thus always to him.

"Your privileges are revoked, dear.  We talked about this.  You agreed."  He held my laptop and phone aloft that they could fall from such pernicious heights.  "You have a condition, Anna.  You aren't well.  Besides I didn't think we would have to make a rule 'no scheduling gatherings for human sacrifice and ritual cannibalism', but here we are."

"They are the only people who understand me!  You'd have me isolated and shut down.  I won't live by your rules or anyone!" I'd have to admit I was barely coherent, but I think I got my point across enough.

"You can have them back when we've locked them down.  I don't want to do this, but I hope you remember what we talked about with the counselor."

He could not have begun to fathom the depths of my despair.  I would never trust him.  The flesh is too weak, I had learned again and again.  I had to eradicate the weakness, the stain, the humanity.  It was the only way.

I wailed.  

It was a futile display of emotion.

He had won, for now.

Deep within the darkness grew all-consuming.  Soon he would lose me completely if he failed to reform.  It *was* his fault.  He is a failure of a father to have allowed this to happen.

I came to him again in the study.  "Daddy.  I need help."

"I know, honey.  I'm doing the best I can.  I'm so sorry I wasn't there after . . ."  Mom died.  He couldn't say it.  I knew and lived it and more.  I owe him the neglect.  I know more now than ever before.  

Nevertheless, the tears came naturally.  I missed her dearly.  The pitiable one tried to hug me.  I refused.

"I can't live like this, Dad.  Something inside me is taking over.  I can feel it growing."

"Have you taken your medication?"  He always concerned himself with my affairs.  I hadn't in some time.  The less real I felt, the less I needed it.  They couldn't banish what was inside of me alone.

Boiling, bubbling, I couldn't hold it back any longer.  Guilt.  I knew he had it.  "You fucking pathetic asshole were less than absent from my life.  What was I to do for years after you told me I reminded you too much of her?  Years of neglect, years.  You never deserved her!"  I stung him deeply.

Perhaps I had finally convinced him,  I would need a priest to exorcize the demons that troubled me.  If not a priest, then blood ritual would suffice.  I had resolved what burdened me was to deep to be excised by anything else.
