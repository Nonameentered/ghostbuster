Hey cool story.  I love how it's told in almost all dialogue.  I'm not sure if I love the character's name being prior to each line, though.  It almost makes it read like a script rather than a story.  It also makes the couple of times you break the routine stand out.

That being said, I loved the themes you presented, an AI taking over human labor, evil manipulations for the almighty click.  Great stuff.  A bit dark on the humor side, but that's up my alley, so I enjoyed it.

The three characters confused me a bit.  I gathered that Jimmy and Matthew were human and Michael was maybe an AI.  But you switch from Matthew and Adrian to Adrian and Michael here:

>Matthew: Well that’s normal.  
>  
>Adrian: That’s what I would have said too if it wasn’t for his burner account. Look at all these posts.  
>  
>A phone leaps into Matthew’s sight. Thousand of posts from Michael flood the screen. An image stands out. It’s got a internet line with the typical circle that’s crossed out.  
>  
>Michael: Ah a code blue. He’s trying to start movement huh.  
>  
>Adrian: What should I do?

Where did Michael enter the scene?  I thought Jimmy went to Matthew's office for help.  Are Michael and Matthew the same person?

>Michael: Adrian, you do remember we work for an evil company right?  
>  
>Adrian’s mouth begins to lift. He couldn’t contain the act.  
>  
>Adrian: I’m just joking. But you really are a sick fuck… eh so am I. What do you have going on?

Everything else is showing me what's going on through dialogue, then there's a single line about Adrian's mouth.  It was strange and took me out of the interplay when all the rest is dialogue.

I might have liked to see more manipulations from the characters, more impact from their day to day jobs.  They seem to take it all in stride even though it's a bit scary.  The competing for records and trying not to be replaced by an AI might be something to expand upon.

Great story.  I liked how you had humans tormenting us with notifications rather than machines.  It was fun.
