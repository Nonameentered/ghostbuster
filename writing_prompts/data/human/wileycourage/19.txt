Congrats SirPiecemaker!

I've read your stories and seen your prompts.  You have a great creative mind!

A few questions:

1. What's your inspiration to write?
2. How long have you been at it?
3. Your grammar and prose and diction and syntax and everything is so clear.  Where'd/how'd you learn to do that?
4. How would you describe your writing?

Congrats again and thank you so much for the fun reads and prompts.
