"Siddie, we're home!"  His mother and father walked into the home dragging and carrying an array of luggage with them.  Sid stood and approached them cautiously.  They both embraced him.

"I'm so happy you're back and we're together again" he said watching their faces and body language closely.

"We missed you!  The vacation is just what we needed, though.  I hope you didn't miss us too much."

"Siddie, your father and I have something to tell you."

"What is it mahm?"

"You're going to be a big brother!"

"But, but, I'm already a big brother.  To Alice."

"Who's Alice?" she asked.  Sid looked at her and matched her questioning expression before running up the stairs to the nursery.

What he found was not Alice's nursery.  He darted into a work room filled with his mother's art supplies instead.  He looked around quickly with is mouth agape.  "Where is she!?" he screamed down to his parents who were climbing the stairs now with their suitcases.

"What is wrong with you, Sid?  You're being weird."  Robert said.  "We won't stop loving you at all when you new sibling arrives."  The father knelt down in the hallway at the top of the stairs when addressing his little boy.  Anne went down the hall to their bedroom to unpack.

"That isn't it!" the boy yelled.

"Oh, Sid.  It's all going to be ok."  He placed a hand on his son's shoulder and looked deeply into his eyes for ten long seconds before noticing Sid was carrying a book. "What's that you've got?" Robert said calmly, pointing at Sid's left hand and the journal he was holding.

"It's . . . it's my diary." Sid responded.

"Where'd you get it, who gave it to you?"

"I got it at . . . school."

"Well that's strange.  Do you like writing, son?"

"I don't know yet."

"Why don't you try writing about this sister you've dreamed up.  Maybe it will help?  You're such a sweet and sensitive kid.  You always have been."  Robert patted Sid's shoulder a few times before standing and joining his wife in their room.

Sid stared blankly, not knowing what to do.  He wanted his parents happy.  He wanted to be together with them.  He wanted to see his little sister again.  While his thoughts swirled, he unconsciously closed his right hand into a fist so hard his fingernails dug into his palm, leaving pink marks.

With his right hand still stinging he opened the journal again to its first page, struck out the other words he had written and began again.  This time he would get it right, he thought he knew.  All it would take is the right combination of words and the lock would be open.  He would be happy again.  His parents would be happy.  He swore it to himself.

Note:  As often happens, I write myself into scenarios that I can't finish quickly, and Sid is extremely stubborn.  There will have to be a part three or more.
