Coming home from work after the night shift at the eternally open diner where I work as a line cook is usually pleasant.  Except tonight was different.  I cracked open my front door with my mind on autopilot when the smell hit me.

*Did something die in here?*  I thought.  I didn't expect to be right.

There was a man.  He was motionless on the couch.  He looked ragged and worn and frighteningly thin, like his skin was hanging off his bones without any flesh between them.

Where I live it's not all that uncommon for drunks to make mistakes and enter someone else's home in order to pass out.  But when I went over to the crappy brown couch to shake him, he didn't move.

*Fine*.  I thought.  I grabbed a decorative paperweight and rubbed it hard on his sternum, expecting him to wake.  It always worked, except for this time.

He didn't move.  I flipped on some lights, and holy shitballs, the guy was clearly dead.  His skin was so pale it was nearly translucent.  I'm not sure if he had anything left in him.  He looked like a disgusting deflated balloon.

Where I had rubbed his chest, there was a sunken crater.  I had broken his bones, but I hadn't heard anything.

Before I could do anything else or get my phone out for pictures and a quick call to 911, there was a knock at my door.  "This is the Police!  OPEN UP!" the officer's deep voice bellowed through the thick wood of the door.

I opened it up for them, and they kicked the door, slamming it into my forehead.

"For fuck's sake!" I cried out, but two uniformed men entered immediately.  I was still rubbing the red mark on my face when I heard them talking to each other in the living room.  "The sick bastard did it again!"

They turned to me and the other officer said loudly, "What do you do with the organs, you sicko?  Where are they?"

I hadn't a clue what they were talking about.  "I just got home from work.  I don't even know who that is.  I was gonna call for a squad to come on over . . . and the coroner."

"Bullshit.  We got a complaint about noise coming from in here.  Screams.  Cries.  They went on for hours."

"I. Was. Not. Here.  Can't you see I was at work?"  I pointed to my nametag and work coveralls.

"Smells like grease.  I bet he eats them."  One officer said to the other.

"I work in a diner, comes with the territory." I responded curtly.

"You're coming with us."

"Fuck off.  I didn't do anything."

"We got a smartass, Steve.  Get the taser."

"I wouldn't do that if I were you."  I couldn't believe the words were coming out of my mouth.

"The hell did you say?  Get on the fucking ground, asshole!"

"No."  I did not want to say that.  My stomach started hurting.  Like I was starving but even worse.  Pang after pang after pang.  So much pain.

Being a relatively large man, the coppers didn't bother trying to put hands on me.  Instead the one raised his taser and pointed it at me.

Before he could pull the trigger, a tentacle with teeth on the end like a lamprey exploded out of my mouth.  My eyes widened and tears formed at the edges, but there was nothing I could do.

The thing latched onto its victims rapidly draining them of their body fluids.  First was the taser-wielder, next was his comrade screaming in terror.

Instead of terror, I felt sated, blissful, calm.  I felt the irresistible urge to sleep, and fell to the floor surrounded by three corpses.  When I awoke, they were gone.  No trace of them remained.

I flipped on the TV for some noise.  A newscaster was reporting on the spate of missing persons cases, but I didn't think anything of it.  I had no idea what happened the night before.  I swear I didn't have a clue.  I swear.

I grabbed a bottle of bourbon, poured a glass, downed it, and then filled it back up.  I had to forget.
