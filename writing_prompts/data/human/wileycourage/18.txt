"You stopped yourselves from doing anything more than making basic fireworks?"  Gorlvba shook its head, and hissed three times rapidly which the two of his species flanking it echoed.

The Human Ambassador did not flinch.  "Of course not.  We spent many years locked in a death grip, our whole planet's existence threatened by so few of us, but that era is in our past.  We succeeded in our mission of harmonious existence with all living things.  We began to understand that we were no . . ."

"Your planet?  Yes, that would be so terrible."  The alien looked back and forth to its fellows with its six eyes.

"Honorable Gorlvba of Gorhoatoad, your weapons testing will clearly need to be conducted upon another star.  This one is clearly inhabited by a sentient species such as they are."  A plumed avian humanoid alien held its beak aloft when speaking.

The Humans whispered to each other.  "They didn't even know we are sapient!"  One blurted into the microphone and translator.

"The Humans will refrain from such outbursts."  A monotone voice from above stated.

"Honorable Council," the Human Ambassador began.  She was dressed in white robes with purple edges and stood to her podium.  "We misunderstood the purpose of today's hearings.  We had thought you initiated first contact for diplomatic purposes.  We had no idea our species was being put on trial.  We have no defenses, no warships.  Ours is a peaceful existence."

"See!  They won't even defend themselves!  How is that sane!?" Gorlvba interjected.

"The Ambassador from Gorlvba is censured.  Silence imposed for five minutes."  The monotone voice stated plainly.

"We have no quarrel with any species.  We are no better than you are.  We have more in common than not. . ."  The Council tables of various species all speaking together roared over the Human Diplomat.

"ORDER."  The voice showed the slightest bit of emotion.  All were silenced.  "VOTE.  The Council has other business concerning more than one mere planet."

"514-388. The Motion carries.  The Sp2-S49Y is not to be destroyed by the Gorhoatoad Tactical Black Hole Displacement Weapon.  Further testing only on approval of the Council.  Humans to be returned to pre-contact status.  We await you in the stars."  The Humans were shuttled back to Earth unceremoniously.

"What just happened?" The Diplomat asked her aides.

"I think we won, Madam?"
