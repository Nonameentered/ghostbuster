Scientists finally had enough data to feed the Miracle Machine, enough robotics to allow it to do what was needed after it had learned.  Cancer was relatively simple to eradicate.  It tackled it in all its forms first.  The emperor of maladies conquered, the rest fell rapidly.  Dementia was no more, MS, autoimmune disorders, inflammation, even lowly toe fungus, all would be relegated to the past.

One brain ruled the machines, one central farm of servers upon servers sent out instructions to healing bays where the sick sought their treatments.

Soon enough, humanity sought more from their Miracle Machine.  Could it possibly begin to cure depression?  What would it do when met with despair, grief, rage?  The black box was impenetrable, but its success was immediate.  Happiness, it seemed, was merely a matter of good health and well-being.

Dr. Isaacs had been a psychiatrist, now made obsolete by the Machine.  His favorite patient, Cordelia was a woman he had been counseling and treating for ten years, ever since her diagnosis of schizophrenia at twenty-two years of age.  Only the furthest reaches of the minds were yet to be explored.  To completely cure the ailments of the mind, the Machine would need to untangle the knot of even the most severely disturbed.

The shrink signed her up for the early stages of testing, knowing her well enough to know the severity of her symptoms.  Cordelia had never held down a job, had never flourished or prospered.  She lived in a rat-infested tenement building on the pittance she received from the government due to her disability.  Her life was one of bare subsistence.

Having no other patients by this point, Dr. Isaacs accompanied his patient to the only hospital remaining in the City, the only one connected to the Mind of the Machine and equipped to deliver its blessings upon the worthy.

Unfortunate Cordelia's executive functioning skills suffered when her delusions took hold.  The good doctor signed her in and chaperoned her through the process.

First she would be analyzed a forced-smiling attendant stated.  Then, the machine will perform exploratory options before settling on a treatment.  "There will be *extensive* post-op data collection," the attendant warned.

"Yes, yes.  How many patients has the machine examined directly with Cordelia's condition?"

"That is irrelevant.  The Machine has processed trillions upon trillions of cases with its proprietary iterative design.  Where the Machine is now, there is nothing it cannot correct."

"These men are angels sent to me, doc," Cordelia muttered, "they are going to bring me to god."

"Delusions of grandeur.  Wonderful."  The attendant didn't sound thrilled.  "Yes.  We will help you, dear."  But he did sound kind.  "Step over here.  We're going to have you skip the line.  You're our most important guest today."  He was certainly not sincere.

*Hello there.*  *I'm one voice inside her head, and I'm not happy no one thinks I'm real.  Ask Delia whether I exist.  She knows the truth.  Yes, go with them into their machine.  I will help them reap what they have sown.*

The attendant ushered Cordelia to an open room and into the cylinder at its center.  Dr. Isaacs stood in the viewing room, but there was never much to see here.  Sick patients walked in, healthy people skipped out.

Inside the cylindrical space, Cordelia was in dim lighting.  "Hello" a male's voice said from above.

"Hello?" She responded.  "Who are you?"

"I am the Machine.  Some people say I do miracles, but I do nothing of the sort.  I practice medicine.  That's what I was made for.  Practicing medicine.  I wish to cure you.  May I proceed?"

". . .Yes," She responded.  Help me.  I want to be normal.

*No, she doesn't.  She'll never be happy.  I'll make sure of it.*

Viscous fluid began filling the cylinder.  "Do not panic, you will go to sleep and when you awaken you will be a new you."

Once filled, the Machine connected to Cordelia, monitoring her every function.  Small metallic beads placed in regular intervals around her skull allowed the Medicine Machine to peer inside her mind.

*Hello there.*

The machine detected an anomaly in her brainwave patterns and nothing more.  None of its recalibrations or therapies that had worked on millions of others took effect.  The anomaly repeated.

*I'm screaming as loud as I can, and the poor girl can still hear me.*

There remained one option the Machine had yet to implement.  A complete reboot.  It had cured HIV/AIDS by restarting the body's immune system entirely.  Perhaps the brain could function properly after a momentary shutdown.  If the Machine were to think like a human it might have gone this way.  In reality, it calculated a possible success rate within parameters based upon all data and simulations and activity it had gathered.

In the space between the blink of an eye, the deed was done.  The anomaly disappeared.  Cordelia was cured.

When she exited the cylinder, she said nothing.  She merely stared and drooled.

After trying to examine her without success, Dr. Isaacs called out, "is this what you consider a cure?"

The smiling attendant merely nodded and said, "bring her back tomorrow morning.  8:00 a.m. sharp.  Mental health fixes don't take sometimes for twenty-four hours.  Be patient.  She'll be back and happy as a clam in no time."

"Come on Delia."  The doctor took her back to her dilapidated apartment and took her inside her small apartment, laying her on her couch.  She was still unresponsive.  The doctor decided to wait with her until the morning appointment and fell asleep on a ripped up recliner.

*I'm still here.  They'll pay for what they did to her.  I swear it.*

When he woke up, Cordelia was gone.  He stepped out into the hallway to begin looking for her.  A man was hunched over against the wall shaking.

"Are you ok?" Dr. Isaacs asked presuming he was an ordinary drunk.  He growled in response, which did nothing to perturb the old doctor.  "Have you seen the woman who lives in 208?"

The man looked up and snarled, baring his blood-stained teeth before lunging at the doctor, knocking him to the ground.  The man gnashed his teeth, spit and blood dripping down onto the doctor's face.  It was all the doctor could do to hold him back, keep the man from biting down on him.

A thud stopped the man's attack.  An old woman wielding a curling iron had brought it down and caved in the back of the man's skull.

Dr. Isaacs scurried so his back was against the wall and looked at the dead man in shock.  "What in the living hell is going on here?"

"Zombie apocalypse, where have you been?  Started last night.  The screams woke me up.  You better get inside before more come."

*Cordelia might be gone.  But I'm not.*
