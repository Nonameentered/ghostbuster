I execute people for a living.  A funny thing, that.  A living made of death.  Perhaps I'm truly undead.  It feels that way.

At least I came by the trade honestly.  My father was an executioner and undertaker, and so am I.  My wife's father was too.  All the people in my family and community, all the people I know are in someway connected to the grisly business.  We share the same air, we smell the same, but we wash and clean like everyone else.  But that's what *they* are.  Everyone else.

Now the old man is truly that.  He sits and mutters and sputters.  It's terrible seeing the man I adored reduced to such, but I must do my duty.  I will wipe the spittle from his chin until he breathes his last.

I do the same for the condemned.  I try to introduce the barest of dignity back into their black and white world.  A touch of grey.  Anymore and they might have hope.

But I do not give hope, when I am done there is nothing more.  The human turned to a warning to others.  Disrupt the King's peace and you may be decapitated.  It's funny then, that what we do in the dungeons isn't in public.  Only the final moments.  No one seems to question the beaten and bruised men and women I cart into the courtyard.  They deserve their lots.  Barnabas would have never been freed by these audiences.

The only man who will get close to me is the priest and only because his role demands it.  He is to perform the ritual, bless the ceremony me and mine perform.  The criminal is given his one last chance to confess, to request salvation.  It won't save his body, but his soul just might be cleansed.  If that doesn't work, I'll clean up after myself as we are expected to do.

"Father." Each line of the ritual has been repeated since the times of our fathers' fathers' fathers' fathers'.  Probably longer.  A different form perhaps, but the ritual of separation from society is an old one.  Banishment will not do anymore.  They must die.

I stare blankly a lot.  My wife catches me in dazes, but I don't feel anything anymore afterwards.  It's a job.  The axe is one of the tools of my trade.  My services are in demand.  Blood begets blood begets blood.

The man in front of me despicably murdered his own child.  Sweat is pouring out of his head.  His lips are parched.  I ladle him water carefully from my bucket.  I wipe his brow and tell him to have courage, to listen to the priest.  It is his only hope I say. 

"Repent!" I bellow so the thirsty crowd could hear.  "Repent!" I repeated.  "Repent." I said the final time.

"I am innocent!"  The fool.  The collared priest prayed nevertheless.

I guided him firmly to the block.  Set him down and chopped off his head.  Such was my fate.
