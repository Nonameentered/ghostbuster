“MMMMMooooothhhherrrr. . .”  A low groaning voice interrupted the young doctor’s observations.  She turned to see a mass of verdant slime, pocked and speckled with varying shades of green.  

She was shocked to see the size of the thing emerging from the walk-in cooler at the rear of the laboratory.  The thing engulfed the entire doorframe and pressed itself out into the room, crushing the glass and cabinets and equipment lining the walls of the space.

She held her pen at the ready in anticipation.

As she watched the process, Dr. Ordie noticed something beneath the slime’s translucent surface.

“What is that?”  She asked, pointing within her “child”.
