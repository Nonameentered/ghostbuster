“You know how in olden times witch doctors would prognosticate about the future by looking at chicken bones in a bowl?”  Cletus’s only movement while talking was the gentle back and forth of the rocking chair on the small wooden deck jutting out from his shotgun house.
  
 
  
“I don’t know nuthun about that.”  Earl finished the statement with a flourish of brown spit from the snuff tucked between his gums and lower lip.  It landed out in the yard among the tufts of grass, quickly soaking into the desiccated ground.  “I told yer college wouldn’t do you no good.  A bunch of fancy words and you still ent up here.”
  
 
  
Cletus shut the book on his lap with a snap.  “I’m no brainiac, just pondering.  Tha’s all.  You know that’s a nasty habit you got there.  ‘Bout time you gave it up, lest the emperor of maladies strike you down.”
  
 
  
“What the hell are you on about with emprahs and chicken bones?”
  
 
  
“That’s what I was saying, Earl, hold up a second.”  Cletus rose from his chair, timing his exit with the forward rock to propel him up with speed.  He disappeared into the rectangular building that was his home and emerged with a jar.  “Look at this here.  What’s it look like to you?”
  
 
  
“It’s a damn pickle jar.  Some brain you are.”
  
 
  
“Yes.  It’s a pickle jar, I picked ‘em myself outta Jones’s pickle-barrel at the store.  Look at it.  You see anything special?”
  
 
  
“They’re movin’ cause you just put it down.”
  
 
  
“Anything else?”
  
 
  
“I got nuthun.”
  
 
  
Cletus opened up the jar with some effort.  “Smell.”
  
 
  
His partner leaned in and took a big sniff.  “Smells like pickle brine.”
  
 
  
“Let the emanation hit your nose a bit longer.”  Earl complied.
  
 
  
“Now look.”
  
 
  
Earl watched as the sunlight shone through the glass container, the murky green liquid with floating vegetable pills.  “Looks like a crystal ball kinda.”
  
 
  
“Exactly!  Look through the brine, look closer.  What do you see?”
  
 
  
“No.  What is that?”
  
 
  
“It washed away like a castle of sand, didn’t it?  You saw the flood too, didn’t you?”
  
 
  
“I seen a lot of water and your home floating away.”
  
 
  
“What do you think about that?”
  
 
  
“I dunno.  You reckon it could happen?  There ain’t no way.”
  
 
  
“I could understand you saying that if bits of cake rained down from above, like a shower of delicious, frosted confetti, but rain and water are more routine than all that.”
  
 
  
“Bones, kings, and now cake.  No one’s gonna believe me down at the waterin’ hole.”
  
 
  
The pickle jar caught Cletus’s attention.  A faint ray of distorted light beckoned him to look deeply into the brine again.  He saw a young girl at an artist’s station carefully laying pieces of paper down in the shape of a lily, painting gold leaves and embossing the surface.  She always loved decoupage and was excellent at it.
  
 
  
Cletus began to tear up, which led to tears falling down his face.  His memories of Alice bubbled to the surface and exploded out of him.
  
 
  
“Oh God.  Now with the sputtering.  Why do I even bother with you?  I get enough shit from the boys already.”
  
 
  
“She’s dead!”  Cletus buried his face in his hands and continued to weep.
  
 
  
Not knowing what to do, Earl stood dumbstruck, mouth slackened so that a thin stream of tobacco-spit ran out of the corner of his thin lips.  A day could have passed in the few minutes Earl stood motionless.  Instead, clouds formed overhead.
  
 
  
“Stop your wailing and look!  It’s fixin’ to rain.”
  
 
  
Wiping the fresh tears from his face, Cletus looked up and it began to rain.  When it would stop, he didn’t know.
  
 
  
“Grab the jar, we’re getting outta here before sumthin’ happens.”  Earl grabbed his friend by the arm and lead him away.
