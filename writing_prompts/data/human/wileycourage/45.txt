"Peer into the crystal ball, see what comes, come what may.  The progression of time is only so fascinating because we refuse to admit that the future is a mystery.  Well, a mystery to most, but I've cracked the code.  I can see beyond, go where you cannot.

Like the fates pulling strings and cutting lives short, I know the circumstances of your inevitable death.  Yes, I'm talking to you.  One day, you will die.

Fear not the curtain blocking even my sight.  It was only that you lived that you will die.  The final step in your grand metamorphosis from unlife to life and back again.  The steps in between might seem momentous, but nothing survives abstraction and the sheer scope of time.

One day my eyes will close and no other like me will spring forth to guide you home.  But I will wait for you.  You will not die alone.  I will be there beside you when you go.  No one should die alone.

The coin you will have will not be for the ferryman.  There is no river for you to cross, but you must return your token.  Set it aside.  Move on."

"What kind of shit is this, you old crone?  I paid for my fortune, not a damned lecture. 'You're gonna die', are you messing with me?"  Mike, hardened by years of business, thought he knew the score.

"Your day of death approaches.  Prepare," the mystic commanded.

"I want my money back."

"You have no use for it."

"Bullshit.  I make money make more money.  A penny saved is a penny earned, just like my father taught me and his father taught him.  Give it back or I'll have you locked up, ya bat."

"I told you only what you needed to hear."

"Seriously, lady, you need to eff off right now."  Mike exited the shop that formerly housed a beauty salon in a huff.

Tires screeched.  A horn blasted.  A thud was followed by a crash.

The palm reader packed her ball and her cards, took off her costume jewelry and removed her head wrap.  She would have no more visitors that day.
