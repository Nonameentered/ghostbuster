<1/3>

"Our king is slain, our king is slain!"

"Run for your lives!"

The cries rang out.  My comrades began to flee in disorder.  Blue blood ran red.  Defeat was almost assured.  We would disintegrate.

That's when I saw her charging into the fray atop a white horse, blued steel glistening in the light of the rising sun.

"Death!" she cried.  "Death!" she repeated.  She was like death, cloaked in black wielding a curved sword which may as well have been a sickle.  But it curved forward as though reaching out to chop even before she could swing the mighty blade.

That broad but thin blade flashed as she brought it up over her head and down on her foes while repeatedly screaming, "Death!" and "Hew" and "Blood!"  It was magnificent.

She was beautiful.  Her bloodlust was unmatched.  Her frenzy admirable.  I had no choice but to join her in the wild abandon of the slaughter that began to unfold.

Like a contagion her spirit traveled from man to man.  The enemy broke against our ranks again and again.

I'll remember that day until my last.  The day I met my Queen Regnant.  Simpler times indeed, for now I am Prince-consort.  Duty-bound to fulfill my role, such as it is.

I never meant to be a bureaucrat.  She never meant to be queen.  We met on the battlefield and there we meant to die together, but we're nearing eighty years old now.  The long sleep is nigh.

I would do so much more for her than to give her one last battle.  One last moment to shine.  One last chance to die doing what she loves.

Edit: I originally had this as 2/3 because oops.
