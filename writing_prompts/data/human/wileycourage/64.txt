Others have said it, but I'll say it too.  Every one of your "premises" is just a longer prompt.  What makes a prompt is the inspiration or assistance it gives to writers to create stories, not its length or detail.

Even if a prompt goes into great detail, it's still a prompt.  As someone who doesn't plan what he writes until his fingers meet the keys, I don't know which parts of the prompt I'm going to focus on, which I'll drop, and which I'll change until the story is done.  That's the fun part for me.  As long as I have some element and make an effort to meet the prompt, which is really easy considering the prompt inspired whatever I'm writing, then I've met the minimal expectation.

Really, this is a fantastic place for inspiration and the pure joy of writing.  Many of us would write stories on contract, but that's not what any of this is.  

The prompter prompts.  The writers write.  Everyone reads.  If someone wants something more specific, there's plenty of ways to get that, but again that's not here.

I wouldn't mind personally if a prompt I wrote inspired a totally wild story that maybe doesn't hit anything I was intending.  Whatever inspires other writers to write anything is good in my book, but then there's a community here and the mods and rules that are set up to make sure that keeps happening.

Before I keep writing, thanks for the interesting topic.  Maybe I'm less concerned because I know I can make any prompt a premise and any premise a prompt, using your definitions.  Flexibility is key.  Anyway, thanks again for the discussion and good luck with everything.
