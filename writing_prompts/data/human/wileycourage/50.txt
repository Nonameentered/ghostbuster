Hinata rubbed his smooth bald head in shock as he watched Asami dispatch the remaining two shinobi with ease and grace.  The only sounds the ninja made were the clattering of the katanas as the hit and rattled against the stone floor.

Three more shinobi somersaulted into the room and through the pillars to the north.

The sōhei stood awestruck as his cat seemed weightless, dancing off the shoulders of the intruders, incapacitating each one with her kama as she swung the iron ball around and around using its weight as counterbalance.

"Obake!"  The deep bellowing voice came from afar, as the remaining shinobi retreated from the training space in disarray.  "You waste yourself among these pitiable monks and their red and orange robes."  A horrific blue humanoid creature with a single horn sprouting from the center of its forehead, a tiger loin cloth, and armed with a kanabō stepped forward.

"Foul beast.  What deal did you strike to accompany mercenary shinobi?"

The Oni only growled and attacked, swinging his club in a long arc down toward Asami.  She dodged, allowing the metal club to smash down onto the ground.  Fragments of rock flew out, slicing Asami's face.

Finally Hinata moved forward, knowing what must be done.  He advanced on the Oni.  Before reaching the beast, his hand snuck into a pocket within his robes from which he produced roasted soybeans.  He threw them out of the hallway leading to the training arena.

"Oni go out!  Blessings come in!" he shouted.  To his surprise, it worked.  The Oni retreated, following the path of the beans and disappeared.

He looked back to the spirit woman cat and grinned.  "I told you I'd keep you safe."
