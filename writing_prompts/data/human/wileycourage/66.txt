Funny story Xack.  I loved the contrast of the subject matter and the narrator's tone too.

For crit:

> Kingdom Code violations

perhaps "violations of the Kingdom Code?"  or "Kingdom Fire Code violations".

>(See Cauldron Brewing Code 91-b)  
>  
>(See files: Bashful, Sleepy, Sneezy, and Dopey)

I loved the citations to the code and other records as it seems to fit with the overly serious narrator.  There were other places you could have slipped in details, such as when the narrator mentioned "uninspected firewood".  Maybe giving the investigation files a faux numbering system would help with the overall tone too.

For incident reports like this even presented as a letter to one's boss, I'd think the narrative would start with place and time.  "At approximately DATE and TIME at ADDRESS, x, y, z."

You could, if you wished, lean into the faux-serious tone even more by making it explicitly an incident report of some kind to be filed rather than what seems like a letter.  If it is a letter, I kind of expected it to be signed in some way.  Or maybe it's the narrative of events attached to an incident report or something like that.

I also wouldn't expect a fire watch/code enforcement official to also be the one fighting fires, but then again it is fantasy, so it's not really a crit, just a note.

The tone and language go less formal at the end which didn't really match what you started.  I think maybe there's a way to hand it off better.

I feel like this narrator wouldn't have to say "numerous violations" and might know the exact numbers instead being as fastidious as the narrator is.

>mining pickaxe

I don't think you have to explain what the pick axe is for here.  Part of using the fairy tales is that you are presuming the reader knows the characters well enough.

None of this is really objective.  Just suggestions and notes.  Your take on the theme was great and you highlighted the genres so well in your story.  It was so fun I wanted to see the consequences for the dwarves and what goes down at the castle.

Well done!
