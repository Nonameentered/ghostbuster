Hey system!  Great job with the letters and the romance!  I got an old-timey feel from it all with the way you had the characters write.  It's fun.

For crit:

First off, these lines.

>forgive my pining prose  
>  
>purple prose

I don't think you need to have the characters acknowledge the style of their prose explicitly like this.  These presumably wouldn't be for public consumption, and it almost sounds like it's you saying sorry for the prose, which I found delightful.  If there's any time for "purple prose" it's in love letters.  I think you might be able to veil the sentiment rather than say it up front like this.

I'd rather you use even more purple prose from Elanor to describe the purple prose from James and how she loves it.  Make it purple prose entirely, you know?  Lean into it, because I love how you've done it here, and want even more of that.

The ending with the pen running dry could have been slightly forshadowed earlier with some mention of wanting to write so many words that James feared his pen would run dry before he could fully express all his exquisite feelings in ornate language.

>and it will be my final correspondence.

Perhaps "this will be" rather than "it will be"?

>The tawny logs

I don't know what James is going for here, but it doesn't sound the most flattering where everything else is.

For whatever reason, I'm imagining that these two wouldn't be the types to use contractions because of their extremely formal tones.  I think removing them would help with the tone.

>Dare not tempt the waves to take you away, if you must be a contemptable fool it shall be here with me!

Maybe, "for if you must".  For some reason I think that fits the tone you established in the letters slightly better.

Great job on the mashup!  It was cute and sweet and what romance is made of, and their voices really read like they were totally in love where their flowery language belongs.  Thanks for the fun read.
