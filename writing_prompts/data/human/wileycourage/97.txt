"I'm not giving you anything until I've had a chance to look at what I'm agreeing to.  Let me talk to this supposed future-self first too."

The process-server frowned.  "Very well.  You're entitled to what you might say is a phone call.  You have fifteen minutes, and then I'll need that thumbprint."  She stepped back.  Light projected out of her tablet and a hologram of an older version of Ricky appeared in his wheelchair.

"Uh hi," Ricky said to himself.

"Hello, young man.  Quite expected that you would request this chat.  Call me Mr. Aguilar for now, or this might get confusing."  The sound didn't come from Mr. Aguilar's mouth, but it matched how Ricky imagined.

"So what's the deal here?  You saw a chance to live a new life, to be like a parasite on a version of your past self?  What if I don't want you to come with me?"  Ricky found himself talking quickly and pressing his questions on the old man.

"It's complicated, Ricky.  I had many years past this one to read and think and grow despite our circumstances.  I'm a lawyer. It took the better part of ten years to get to this point, to win a parallel universe.  I won't let you stand in my way."

"I'm my own person!" Ricky objected.

"Not anymore."

"No."  Ricky looked to the process-server as tears welled in his eyes.  "Is there any way I can go back to my old life?  I won't be like him, I swear."

"She'll leave you, Ricky."

"She left you, but it doesn't have to be the same for me."

"To decline place your thumbprint here."  The server was terse and to the point.  "You'll be transported to a parallel universe where your accident happens.  Understand?"

"Yes."
