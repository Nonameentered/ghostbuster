I knew I shouldn't have let my son watch that horror movie tonight. So I figured that it wouldn't be so bad for him to learn a thing or two about scary movies. Until I am in the presence of a living, breathing yokai called Tofu-Kozo, small little servants who deliver tofu and sake. They are timid creatures.

My kid watched this horror movie about a ghost child, and now he's terrified of Tofu-Kozo in his closet. Tofu won't even leave the closet because he's also scared. I tried explaining to my son that tofu is a harmless creature. That tofu gives outâ€¦ well, tofu! My son made a disgusted face. He didn't want to try it. I can't tell him about the free sake, as he's too young for that.

This is a rare chance, and my son is ruining it. All I want to do is to talk to the little guy for free booze or maybe display him out for the world to see and charge admission! If only I could get my son and tofu not to be scared of each other, I'd get my ticket to fame and success!

To succeed, I hatch a plan to kidnap Tofu-Kozo and hide him in my closet. I called the old ex-wife and asked her if she'd take him for a little. Thankfully she agreed, with a bit of suspicion. Though I love hanging with my son as much as possible, I couldn't pass this opportunity up. Anxiously, I count the days till she arrives to pick him up.

I gave her a little money to spend while they were out together. After she left, I waited ten minutes and grabbed an old rice bag I had bought from the international market. It was more substantial than my garbage bags and still the perfect size. I entered my son's room, holding the bag open with both hands. My foot kicked the door open. I went down on my knees and threw my hands over him. 

He's in my bag, and he's heavy! I'm talking back-breaking, and his panicking doesn't help. I try to carry him on my back, but he's kicking and screaming. So finally, I settled with holding the bag away from me as if I had picked up a dog turd in a Walmart sack. After putting him in my closet, I slammed the door shut and locked it. My son comes home.

"I got rid of the monster!" I say.

"Thank you so much, Dad." He's all sugared up. His mom told me he got to drink four and a half cokes. I thank her anyways, and my son runs to his room. I was irritated at my wife for giving him too many sweets, but I decided to wash it down with some sake and tofu. In my room, I opened my closet and found it empty. Then my son yells,

"Dad! He's backkk."
