The Fallen Angel Farm

The succubi and incubi were entertaining the hard-working farmers after an exhausting day. Beelzebub, the lord of the flies, was in charge of breaking down rotten produce. He sent his flies to consume the waste. Sisyphus rolled his boulder across the farmland as small little imps sprinkled seeds. The lead farmer, Solomon, chilled by drinking wine with Belphagor while Mammon chewed them out for not making enough money.


Leviathan, envious of Solomon owning the farm, started to drown the farmland in a ploy to ruin Solomon’s unjust contract. However, Lucifer reminded the giant serpent servant to follow the deal, or he’ll labor in a far more toxic work environment, Hell. The sirens giggle at Leviathan’s wrath. “Wrath is for Sathanas!” They taunted Leviathan. Sathanas was another word for Satan or Lucifer, who was soon about to back that up if Leviathan continued to forgo the deal with Solomon. 

The produce that is fruitful from Solomon’s farm becomes medicine. You can hear the witches laugh with glee as they stir their cauldrons. Finally, night falls, and the farmers return to bed with their demon companions. They slept well, and when morning arrived, Solomon’s farmers market opened for business.
