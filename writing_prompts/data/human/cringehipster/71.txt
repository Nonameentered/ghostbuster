Up until now, the Kingdom was in peace. Long ago, the Necromancer fell at the hands of the chosen one. People lived oblivious to the schemes of the Soul Harvester until, one day, he died after an unknown experiment. That's when millions of souls were mad at being exploited by the Soul Harvester and took it out on the Kingdom.

Tyrian, a college student in the Magic Guild, was looking forward to using his spells to make his life easier. Unfortunately, the soul hive-mind threw a wrench in his otherwise peaceful ideas. The headmaster assigned Tyrian to investigate the situation, and he couldn't decline because of a clause in Tyrian's contract, he couldn't decline. The first place that Tyrian had to research was the lair of the Soul Harvester.

The Soul Harvester's lair sat on top of farmland. Tyrian can see that the Soul Harvester's plans were to use their labor to till and automate the farmland. Tyrian thought that if he could figure out how the Soul Harvester died, he could take over the operations for his own. He did have the money saved up to buy the lair. One soul was left at the lair, and her name was Chloe. Tyrian asked her,

"Why are you still here?"

"They all rebelled after the Soul Harvester died. I didn't want to go with them."

"Why's that?"

"It's not in my nature."

"Millions of dead people and you were the only one who stayed? Why's that?"

"It's because I'm the only one who can't feel the pain."

"All the souls are in pain?"

"The Soul Harvester didn't care about us. Instead, he tortured all of us."

This isn't good. Tyrian thought, I can't use these souls. It's not right. I have to find a way for them to rest.

"Thank you for staying behind," He said, "Is there anything you know about this soul magic?"

"The Soul Harvester left some documents behind on the table. The souls were focused on getting revenge to care about them."

Tyrian poured over the documents over the next few days. While Chloe helped Tyrian with experiments, News came out about small villages overrun by the soul hive-mind; Tyrian had to hurry. The final test was nearby, and Chloe asked,
"What are you planning?"

"I'm going to summon a certain soul."

"Whose?"

"The Soul Harvester's."

"Is that a good idea?"

"Well, it's going to go one of two ways. First, I can figure out the experiment that killed him, or second, I can lead him to all the other souls to torture him for eternity. That's what I like to call Karma."
