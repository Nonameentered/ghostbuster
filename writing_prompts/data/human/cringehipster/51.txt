"Now, hold on. Isn't it bad practice to let a vampire into your home?" I asked.

"It's another one of those hurtful stereotypes. Trust me; we'd come up with a craftier excuse." My curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to let them in. I wondered what a vampire being is like. Are there tremendous powers? Do I get to not worry about death? I've known little about them from my family. So I ask them,

"Do you guys drink coffee?"

"Of course. Blood is just a meal, and we still drink beverages."

"Do you guys have to pee a lot? Since most of your diet contains liquid?" This was something I wondered while being bored.

"I never thought about that. No, I'd say bathroom schedule is the same as once we were human."

"How long have you guys been vampires?"

"Vladimir has been a vampire for three years. As for me, about ten years."

"And your name?"

"Alucard." Is this a scam? No one would name their child these silly names.

"I'm guessing that vampires aren't immortal since you guys are looking for more vampires."

"That's true. Vampires do get to live for 200 years, but all things die off." I pour them some coffee.

"Would you like some cream with your coffee?"

"Yes, please." I don't usually drink cream in my coffee, so I get my special creamer for guests. Then I place their cups on the table. "Oh, I meant to let you guys pour the creamer."

"It's fine. So, what do you think about becoming a vampire?"

"I think it's an interesting lifestyle. But, I do have some concerns."

Alucard takes a sip of his coffee. He notices Vladimir hasn't had any and gestures to him to drink it as well. Vladimir takes a swig, and Alucard continues, "I understand. But, tell me, have you watched the movie Avatar?"

"I have. It's a great movie."

"Remember, he forfeited his humanity? It's like that, but it only takes a-" He coughs and then starts again, "It only takes a night to become a vampire."

"Thank god. I didn't want to go into those jelly pods."

"Right!" Vladimir coughs as well. "This coffee is spicy."

"Let me tell you something."

"Sure." Alucard coughs again. His face is sweaty.

"Are you aware of my last name?"

"No."

"Hellsing."

"No!"

Vladimir spits out his coffee and lunges at my neck, gripping it; He pushes me back against the kitchen counter. My hand feels the knob of the silverware drawer and yanks it open. I grab a silver butter knife to stab into Vlad's neck. His hands release from my neck. 

Alucard is on his knees, trying to cough the silver specks out of his lungs. But, unfortunately, he can't be cured. I pull his hair and make him look at me.

"I'm grateful to hear you're an endangered species." My first vampire down, Dad's going to be proud.
