I am afraid to write. If the realities I make are real, then what’s the point of continuing? I fear that I won’t be able to have meaningful conflict in my stories in the future. That acid trip was real. I could see the dystopian novel I was working on in real-time. All the scenes I wrote, I lived and suffered in. In a way, I was proud of what I accomplished but horrified at how messed up my mind was.

I went to my computer and pulled up Indeed. I was going to quit writing, but I needed to atone for what I had created. I’ll work a job where I help people. I could make money that way and write a happy ending to that world. But that didn’t last long.

I was back to writing in that world again, as my publisher called and said he loved my work. I couldn’t find anything fulfilling for work from Indeed, so here I am again. I was torturing those as the mad god I was destined to be. I was angry at the world for leaving me to create this universal torture chamber. This caused me to be aware of my world.

Was a writer out there suffering like I am? Is he writing about his difficulties in finding a job, maintaining his worlds, and going through the scenarios I am going through? I plead with him to make me the exception. I don’t want to be responsible for creating unjust worlds.
