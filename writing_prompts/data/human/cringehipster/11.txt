Once the money was collected and deposited into Bob's bank, he got out of his rut. He was throwing away the open bottles of booze, dusting ( which is something that bob despises,) and grooming. He wanted to look and smell presentable to the academy on the off chance that the Wizard was there. 

When Bob mustered up the courage to arrive, thankfully, the Wizard wasn't there. Bob was sure that the group knew he had taken the money, so he wasn't ready for a heated argument with the Wizard for taking it. The receptionist led Bob into a lobby, and Bob sat patiently until another person could get to him.

"Bob, I take it?"

"Yes, sir."

"And you're here to make a 500k donation to the academy?"

"Yes, sir, I am."

"Alright. If you will fill out this paperwork," the man slides the paper towards Bob and then the man clears his throat, "mind telling me why you're making such a sizable donation?" Bob looked up at him, mouth agape, and then it closed. Oh yeah, Bob thought, this is an enormous amount to donate on such short notice. Anyone would look at him like this. Itâ€™s nothing that is odd, and Bob said.

"I didn't feel right taking all the money after what happened."

"Okay then. Thank you for your donation."

After everything was completed, Bob left the academy. Bob gave, without taking, the new motto that he will live by from this day forward. He gave most of his portion to the Fighter's and Cleric's recreational pursuits. Before settling on a measly 100k. Enough for Bob's next idea.

The sniper rifle sat on the table of a dwarven engineer, the one who hired an assassin to take out Bob. The dwarf sat in front of Bob, looking out of the corner of his eye; he couldn't handle the silence.

"Why would you come to me?"

"You seemed dedicated enough to send hitmen for this weapon.  So I want you to make me another one. Oh, and I expect a generous discount while we're at it. Or you will see what happens when you send hitmen to kill someone." Bob's poker face was enough to make the Dwarf terrified. His hands started to feel the muzzle of the rife, and the Dwarf's voice started to heighten,

"This is incredible. I haven't seen anything like this before. The steel here is excellently crafted. It couldn't be from this world."

"What makes you say that?"

"Look at how this weapon fires. It's unlike our technology today. Handing this weapon to me was a huge mistake. If I had known long ago how dangerous this weapon was, I wouldn't have sent people after it. First, I wouldn't, even one, know what to do with myself, and two, this weapon would revolutionize war. This would give the kingdom a huge advantage if they got their hands on this."

"And why would this matter to you?"

"The dwarves and the kingdom do not have the best of relations."

"Well, that should be more incentive for you to keep quiet about this arrangement."

"I cannot in good conscience trust myself in constructing this weapon. I would easily cave in and sell it on the black market."

"I would have never thought you would do anything unethical for your own gain!" Bob slapped his cheek and made a silly expression. "I appreciate your honesty." He said, and then the dwarven's blacksmith room called out to him, and Bob looked back at the lonely dwarf.

"Hey, I have a question."

"What are you planning?"

"Answer my question first, jeez. Do many customers come in?"

"Not many."

"Are they a chatty type?"

"Adventurers? Hell no."

"Hmm."

"I know that face."

"Well, if you won't make me my sniper rifle, teach me how to become a blacksmith."

With that, a year passed, and soon Bob was the front cashier for all the transactions. Bob eagerly took customer orders and even offered discounts to practice his skill. Every day, Bob read books, practiced, and got plenty of sleep to perfect the art of smithing. Then the moment arrived when Bob examined the rifle, confident that he could replicate this legendary weapon, but he needed a rare metal from one of the local dungeons. And he needed it fast, as a new necromancer appeared, hell-bent on destroying the kingdom again.
