To anyone who believes that they can get their way by killing, stealing, or hurting others in any way, you're not a real villain. You're a cheap asshole. A real villain presents an argument for the hero. You have to be a foil for the hero, to make him question what's right and wrong. Be like me, I study philosophy for hours to make whoever I face baffled by my plans.

A true villain creates a morality scenario. Take something like the trolley question, it is basic, but it can be profound. This is where you get to discover who the hero really is. What makes him tick, what would he do if it was his damsel? There are many dilemmas out there to generate real problems with efficient answers that not only better you, but others as well. 

Your schemes can pave the way for society to grow and flourish. Even when you take the L, at least you learn something. Simply killing your enemy's family is going to create further villains. As contrarians, we have to mock the heroes. To pull pranks on them, and afterward they facepalm and continue to make the world a better place for everyone.
