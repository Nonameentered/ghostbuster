An NPCs guide to survival.

I'm sorry to hear that you did not get to be chosen for the role of the main protagonist. Better luck next life. If you are picking up this book, you must be worried that the main protagonist will murder you in a sadistic way. It's likely because gamers are bored individuals who will enjoy your torture.

I've included a list of games for you to prepare. Some of these games range from pacifist to downright horrid worlds to live in. Starting with:

Pokémon:
This world is simple. You'll have to do a lot of standing. Once a Pokémon trainer comes across your sight, you must battle him. If he beats you, it's customary to give him your phone number and call him as much as possible. After that, the most mundane thing can happen, and you must tell him about it.

Fallout:
Better hope you are not a ghoul. Being a ghoul is suffering. Not even a Buddhist monk can handle the excruciating pain of being a ghoul. Take care not to enter areas that make the Geiger counter tick, and avoid areas that are not near roads. It's Deathclaw haven.

Elder Scrolls:
The saying goes, "Snitches get stitches." The main character will lie, cheat, steal, and kill. Even if he dies, he will reload the world. So it's safe to avoid the main character as much as possible. Always sell him what he needs, or he will kill you. Pretend to like him for him to raise up his speechcraft skill.

SoulsLike:
Whatever you do, do not be fair. Cheat, steal, and kill the enemy player as much as possible. Make sure to anger him so that he quits the game. If you're a boss, make the first half of your health bar a fun challenge, but as soon as you get to the second part, throw in as much bullshit as you can muster. Do not let him catch a break. 

Shin Megami Tensei:
Yeah, if you're an NPC in this world, you're screwed. 

Animal Crossing:
I hope the player likes you; otherwise, he will boot you out of his town. He is a god. Give him good gifts and be interesting. If you are not the animal he wants for his village, kiss your butt goodbye.
