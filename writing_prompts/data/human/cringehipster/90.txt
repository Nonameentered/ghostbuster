I take another sip of my Elmer’s glue. A valentine sits on my desk reading,

I hart u,

Ur secret crush.

Immediately, my heart beats faster from reading the note. I take another sip of gloppy Elmer’s to take the edge off. I examine the card for more clues on that temptress aiming to give me a heart attack. It’s before recess, and before the day is over, I must crack this case. 

I write a note to my best friend Johnny with the stationary on my desk. Johnny is the school hustler, and he can get me all the gossip from the hallways. After folding another piece of paper to make an envelope, I stick a dum dum in it for the upfront fee for info. Then I finish the last drop of my Elmer’s glue before heading to the craft station for more.


Yes, I am addicted to drinking glue and only the GOOD stuff. Elmer’s glue has the perfect recipe for washing away the pain of having homework. I can quit anytime, but my teacher says it’s toxic for me. What does she know? Outside the hallway of the arts and crafts classroom, Mark stands outside.

“Need more Elmers?” Mark asked.

“Yes. Two bottles.”

“I’m going to need three dum dums for that.”

“That’s two more dum dums than last time.”

“Yeah, but the teacher’s on to me.”

“Fine,” I reach in my pocket and grab the last two suckers, “will bubblegum and mystery do?”

“Yup.”

I wince after handing him the suckers. Hopefully, I can sneak some Elmer’s out on the playground during recess. After receiving my expensive vices in exchange, I hear a shout from Johnny.

“I have an idea on who your secret crush is.”

“Really? Who?”

“Yeah. Look at your card.”

I pull the card out of my pocket. There are carebears and hearts on it. Johnny snatches the card out and points at it,

“See! Remember last Thursday during recess when Liz wore the carebears shirt?”

“You think she likes me?”

“Do you like her?”

“Uh.. yeah.”

Then Johnny sprints off, shouting along the way, “Aaron likes Liz, Aaron likes Liz….” I start to chase the snitch, and he’s turning around the corners and jumping off stairs. It was hard to keep up, and I gave up. It’s time to get out there on the ol’ playground and do things the old-fashioned way. More stationery is in my pocket, so I am writing another note to Liz. It reads,

“Do you like me?”

Yes

Or 

No

Please circle.

To seal the envelope, I need to use glue. I can’t sacrifice my Elmer’s. I try searching for off-brand glue, but none can be found. I’m not sure if I should use my special glue to ask if Liz likes me.
