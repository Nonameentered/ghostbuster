It's like the movies! Like in the DaVinci code, the good guy's always on the run. If I didn't want to live a peaceful life, I would harbor a criminal and join in on the fun. But there's also the possibility that he's dangerous. So he's got to get away from me as far as he can. In order to do that, I call up a friend.

"Hey! I need your help! Get over here fast."

I hang up and start to talk with the temporary roomie.

"So, what are you going to do next?"

"Well, I need to figure out what this code means."

"Code?"

"Yeah. This is a cryptogram, and I can crack it."

"Let me see that." 

It's full of indecipherable text, but I'm curious. So I take a picture of the puzzle and then go to my PC.

"What are you doing?"

"I think I can run this through my programs and crack it."

"You know about this stuff?"

"Yeah. I took a class on it. I never thought it would come in handy until now." I was acting on impulse, I didn't want to be involved, but here I amâ€”accomplice to a fugitive. I heard tires outside my house, and the program is 90% completed.

"The feds are here."

"Nah, that's got to be my friend."

"That doesn't look like your friend."

I leave my computer to look outside. The feds are here! Five black SUVs, and man, they're quick. I should have known that my friend would call the cops instead.

"We gotta go!"

"Come on! We're 95% there."

"No time."

He grabs the document from my scanner and grabs my arm. I should have kept quiet.
