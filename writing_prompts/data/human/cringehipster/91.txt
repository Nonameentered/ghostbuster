It's not as bad as retail, but I wish I decided on being a janitor instead. I became a mortician to get some peace and quiet. I spent a year working at the supermarket, dealing with Karens and entitled pricks to get the knowledge. Now I am working in the morgue, dealing with Karens and entitled pricks. At least I don't have to worry about customer satisfaction. That beats the supermarket.

One day, I was working late at night. I was sewing some of the stitches from a dead lady. Her cats ate her. I rubbed Vaseline under my nose cause she stunk of cat litter and death. Her ghost was right behind me,

"They ate me!"

"Should have fed them."

"I did! Sprinkles would never do that."

"They were hungry."

"Hey, that doesn't look right," she said while I was trying to make her hair look somewhat presentable, "part it the other way."

"That looks stupid."

"I don't care."

I try to let people decide their appearance before they're buried. It's what sets me apart from other morticians. This lady is just too much. She keeps chattering about her precious Sprinkles. I'm focused on what that pistachio ice cream will taste like. 

"No! Nooo. I want my hair like this."

I slam my tools on the table. She gets startled for a moment and continues to chastise me. 

"I'm going home!" I yell. On the way, I'm followed by her. I turn around and tell her, "Stop."

"What do you mean? I can't go anywhere."

"Look, if you want me to work faster, I can't have you on my ass twenty-four seven."

"I'm tired of being stuck in that cold room."

"Any room with you in it is cold."

"Can I just please stay the night?"

I roll my eyes. You can't even imagine how many ghosts ask me this every week. Sometimes I cave, which results in no sleep for me. Other times, I pour salt to prevent them from entering my home. I look at her ghostly figure. She does look nice. Even though she's a hundred years old and her hair is parted weird, her ghostly figures show her prime twenty something years before the wrinkles. 

"All right."

I grab the pistachio ice cream and pen and my journal from my room. I play some jazz over my speaker and light a candle. 

"So, tell me about yourself."
