"Help him? This is considered helping him?"

"Yeah. Are you saying that he wouldn't be great for us?"

"Not at all. I don't understand why giving him a role here would be considered helping him. We need him, and he knows how to run companies."

"As a former CEO, yes, he would. Are you not worried that he may not want to work for you since you outrank him?"

"You know as much as anyone that I wouldn't let that affect me."

That's what I said to them. My boss believes that my old friend will have a grudge against me, but it's the opposite way around. I hate him. He threw me out of his company and humiliated me when I needed help. I'm in this terrible job because of him, and now he's in with me. 

It's his first day, and he walks in five minutes early. We run through orientation. We've gone over all the duties he will be performing, including the responsibilities assigned to me. After he's shown around, I tell him, "Alright. Now that we've gone over everything, are there any questions?"

"No." He didn't call me sir. I can tell that he's butthurt after turning to me. 


"Okay. This needs to be completed by 3 o'clock today. I will check on you every now and then to see if you need help." I shut the door and head to my office. Finally, I got to the point where I told others what to do, and I could screw around. That's what I like to call 'Freedom.' Months go by, and I have ten hobbies that I am knee-deep into. The extra time is handy to start my side business and get paid on the plus side. It wouldn't last forever, though.

Today, I walked into the office. My boss said he wanted to talk to me at the end of my shift. I knew what was going to come. At 5, I walked into his office. My friend's sitting there, his leg is resting on his knee and his arms on the back of the chair. 

"Have a seat," My boss said, "We regret to inform you, but we're downsizing." That wasn't shocking. I knew the day would come. "You will receive a generous severance package."

"What's going to happen with Sam?"

"Sam's performance is what's keeping him on board. Under your guidance, we hired him for his experience. You'll be the first to call if we have an opening." It was all corporate bullshit. Sam was able to charm his way around with anyone. It wouldn't matter if I said that I was his supervisor, leading to his success. It wouldn't matter because Sam had a way with people, which I picked up from working with him.

"Thank you."

With that closing statement, I left with my things. It didn't take long for Sam to take my office. He didn't know that I got an offer to work at his old company. While he's busy taking up old news, I'm on my way to trump him.
