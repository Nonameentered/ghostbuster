Hello, dear friend.

Yes. I can speak to you through my writing. I come from another world. A world in which you live in modern society. A world in which your knowledge is accessible in your hands through a device you call the smartphone. I am aware of this. Things are different in my world.

In my world, libraries are in. If I needed information, then I must take a trip to the library. My favorite library is in York, a few feet from where I live. While I have used a smartphone before in my adventures, I prefer going through books. There is something about flipping the pages and kicking back with an excellent coffee.

My question is, why am I aware of your world? My gothic land is antiquated compared to yours. Why have I been given the ability to talk to you? There is a reason for everything, thanks to cosmic entities. I don’t believe this to be a trick from the old god Nyarlathotep. If it were, I would feel a sinister presence in all this.

If you’re feeling the sensation of our worlds colliding, that is okay. I am, too, and yet, I find great comfort in this. I can learn from talking to you. I can teach you about the mysteries I discovered in my debates with the gods. You and I can reach enlightenment, but first, I need you to do something for me.

You must be able to travel; the concept of time doesn’t matter because our worlds are different. You must head to York and go to the library. Then, you must write to me. It doesn’t matter what you write on. It can even be a computer. This is the next step for us. If you do this, we’ll be able to save our worlds.

I understand that your world is dying. Perhaps this is what the cosmic gods wish. It could be their plan to escape from my world into yours. Fret not, however, because this is all part of my plan. You only need to trust me.
