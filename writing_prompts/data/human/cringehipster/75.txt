I order the same thing every week: a small matcha latte and a cake. I’m not your typical handsome guy, and you can imagine my face when I got the first phone number written on the receipt. I’m in a committed relationship, though. There was newfound confidence! I wasn’t used to receiving phone numbers from women. Then the next week arrived, and a second lady wrote her phone number on the receipt.

I started to wonder if I had done something with my hair or have I had suddenly got fitter. I spent hours in front of a mirror or on the camera with my phone. Nothing outwardly seemed different. Even worse, my girlfriend was in love with another man. She didn’t try to communicate with me in the last few months. Finally, she broke up with me, and I found out later that she was with that guy within five minutes of the breakup. I didn’t go to the cafe for a while.

After weeks of sleeping all the time, not getting out, and eating like trash, I went outside and tried that touching grass thing the internet was talking about. I stopped by the cafe and got that matcha tea latte. It was smooth and had that grassy flavor that I loved. Then I went to pocket that receipt, but not before examining it. The third lady left her number on the receipt.

Now, as a bachelor looking to get rid of that title. I decided to chat with the lady who gave me her first number. After all, she chose me first! You can see me beaming as I type on my phone,

“Hey!”

“Who is this?”

“This is the guy from the cafe ^_^.”

Then I was blocked, but I didn’t let that stop me. I waited for a little and texted the second number.

“Hey! This is the guy to who you left your number to!” I made sure to use emojis. I read in an article that it makes you seem friendly. I was still BLOCKED! Well, third times the charm… and I was blocked already. What is going on? I decided not to press it. I still had a great day that day! A week later, I stopped in the same cafe.

As usual, I got my matcha tea latte and the phone number on the receipt. So I walked up to the lady and asked, “Is this your number?”

“Yes! Text me soon.” She said.

“You’re the fourth person who has done this.” Her face dropped to a frown, and then she beckoned me to follow her. We got outside, and she started,

“So, my boss tells us to leave phone numbers on the receipts for better tips.”
