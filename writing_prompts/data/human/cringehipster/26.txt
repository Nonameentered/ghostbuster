At the Justice League Watchtower’s meeting room, the air in the room had urgency. No one knew how to handle Arkham’s latest patient who was a little too knowledgeable about the identities of the world’s greatest meta humans. This is the first time a criminal was allowed inside the Watchtower’s meeting room, but not without supervision, and what better supervisor than the man of steel himself? Wonder Woman couldn’t take it, as it’s been a moment since John let the squad know what’s going on. He was reading the mind of the prisoner, trying to discover on how the lunatic knew their names.

“We need to take him to the Phantom Zone.” Wonder Woman said. This wasn’t the first time it was said, but the Flash was quick to defend.

“I still don’t think it’s right.”

“It’s still odd that he has our names.” Supes said.

“We can’t let him out of here.” Wonder Woman said.

“Plenty of people know our identities,” Batman jumped in, “why would we lock someone in for knowing it.”

“Because it’s people that we trust that know.”

“I for one won’t care if mine come out. Trust me, plenty of our enemies know our identities. Even the Joker knows mine.”

“You don’t understand, Bats.” The Flash said, “I have a family. I need to keep my identity safe. Otherwise people will get hurt.”

“I have Lois, Bruce. We saw what happened in the other world when Lois died. I can’t allow that to happen.”

“Where’s Green Lantern in all of this?” 

“He’s out.”

“I propose that we put this to a vote.”

The League votes, everyone except Bruce Wayne in favor. 

“Looks like we’ve come to an agreement. Sorry Bruce.” The Flash said. As if the Martian Manhunter heard the vote, he joins in.

“Ah. Welcome back Jo-”

“Oh. No. I’m not John. This is the lunatic that you just voted to go into the Phantom Zone.” He fades through the Watchtower, leaving his old body lifeless.

“I’m on him.” Superman said before dashing and leaping out of the bay of the watchtower. Everyone looks at Batman for what to do.

“Glad that I made those contingency plans now?”
