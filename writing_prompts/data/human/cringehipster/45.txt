Hello? Human food. The werewolf clearly is a human before a dog.

/u/zxcdr:

Are you kidding? Do you see the prices today? I didn't ask for a werewolf companion to rip my furniture and make me spend more money on food. Dog food is cheaper.

/u/roastiemillenial:

Have you even tried dog food?

/u/zxcdr:

I have. My favorite is the beef stew one.

/u/cringehipster:

What the hell? What made you even think that was good?

/u/zxdcr:

I opened a can and it smelled good. I stuck my finger in and got a taste. Soon the whole can was devoured.

/u/armchairdoctor:

I did some research. Those who are making the transition to becoming a werewolf are addicted to eating dog food.

/u/midnighter:

I guess that means I'm about to become a werewolf too.

/u/cringehipster:

Oh come on, we can't listen to a random doctor on the internet. It's human to try dog food at least once.

/u/cringehipster:

Right?

/u/cringehipster:

Guys?
