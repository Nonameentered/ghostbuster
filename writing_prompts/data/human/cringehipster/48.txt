The other guys never would step it up. They always tiptoed around me, never asking me on a date. This dragon might be using me, but she’s got an Amazonian empress energy. She had me on a leash. Both figuratively and literally. It was hard to think. Finally, she asked me if I would take her hand in marriage.  

I couldn’t blurt out an answer any faster. I stuttered, “Yeah, I gu- yeah.” Her face was confused. She didn’t expect me to say yes that fast. In an attempt to save face, I tried to explain that the other guys were trash and not worth the time. She nodded her head, and I awkwardly grabbed her hand.

“What are you doing?”

“I…” I look at her blue eyes for a moment, losing my train of thought. “I don’t know your name.”

“Rena.”

After a night of “talking,” it was time to confront my parents about my decision. I wanted sneak Rena into the kingdom as a human, but I couldn’t let them know that Rena is from the enemy kingdom. We hatched a plan. Rena was going to pose from an unknown kingdom that was undiscovered. This kingdom has vanished due to a vague reason. Rena can use my empire’s wealth to establish her own.

Before we headed out, Rena wanted to ask me something. “Are you sure that we’re not moving too fast?” It was a profound question. There’s a chance that she’s using me. Why is she asking me this? This is making me worried. Maybe this isn’t the right gal for me. I didn’t answer her. I was stuck. My mind is swimming with thoughts.

Rena’s right. What if my parents won’t accept this? I got kidnapped by Rena. That’s a major red flag there. What will the kingdom think of me? What if Rena backstabs me? Is she playing me? I rush out of Rena’s lair. I’m not letting it happen again.

I’m back home. My parents were delighted to hear that I had escaped, and life went on. The routines of everyday life played out. Talk to some bachelor or Bachelorette, get disappointed, and go to bed. I try to have a glass of milk before bed to calm myself, but I’m kept up night after night.

The final straw that broke the camel’s back was when my parents arranged my marriage. My new husband was Jeremy, the guy who bullied me back then. I was furious. I shouted,

“You would take him back?! After all that he’s done to me?”

“Honey, it’s for the best. His kingdom will provide you with protection.”

“Protection? I don’t give a shit about protection.”

“You need to understand that you have-”

“No! I’m not going to allow this. I don’t want him.”

“You have to think about the kingdom.”

“Fuck the kingdom. I’m gay! I’m gay, Mom and Dad. I am gay, and I am in love with a dragon!”
