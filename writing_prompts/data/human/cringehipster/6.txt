"Wait! You were willing to trust me this whole time?" The Necromancer said.

"I had to put it to the test."

"Wouldn't challenging me for my trust defeat the purpose?"

"Not at all. Otherwise, the door wouldn't have opened if it didn't detect our trust in each other."

"Damn. I wish I could be as cold and calculating as you."

"You wouldn't. I'm surprised you even trusted me at all."

They walked to the next doorway, their steps getting lighter and lighter until they reached the second door, which read,

*Those who wait are rewarded*

"Those who wait are rewarded. How long do we have to wait for?" Bob asked.

"Well, I don't know when the door's going open."

Time passes on as they make plans to take out the upcoming villain.

"You think that we need to leave now? There doesn't seem to be enough time." The Necromancer asked.

"The door must be a test of perseverance," Bob said.

But it looked as if the test was taking longer than they estimated. 

"Hey. Before I arrived here, the new guy was ready to take out the Academy, since the first door is open, I could do the rest of the test alone?"

"Wasn't the whole point of this was to not do it all alone?"

"Well, it wouldn't be us alone. I'll make my way back to you as I get the Elixirium."

"But what if the third trial requires both of us?"

"I don't believe that's going to happen. We have to have faith in each other. After all, we passed the first trial together."

He's right, Bob thought. Bob couldn't figure out how much time had passed. It felt like weeks; however, the Necromancer reassured him that only a few days might have passed. They do have each other’s trust.

"I might have to admit that I, too lost track of time." The Necromancer said, "It could have been months."

"Months?! Then I have to leave now."

"You're right. I don't worry. I'll take care of it. You’ll see me soon."

Bob started to go through the hallway. His footsteps are getting heavier and heavier. Then he heard the Necromancer yell, and Bob whipped around and rushed back, only to find the Necromancer waiting.

"Did you say something? Bob asked."

"No, not at all."

"Alright."

Bob started his way back. Each time Bob entered the hallway, his footsteps were heavier and heavier. Then the voice returned,

"Come back."

Bob felt that it was the Necromancer's voice. When he returned, he found the Necromancer in the same place. Waiting.
