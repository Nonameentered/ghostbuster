It’s a pain to live in two different years, but I must with these inflation rates. Today, it’s September 5, 2022. I left my job and went to an abandoned warehouse to go home. There’s a time machine sitting there, and it’s better than the commute. I fire the engine on and step through the machine. It’s September 5, 1980, and I make it back home. On my porch is him…

By him, I mean Thorvaldsen. A future billionaire who wants to buy my house. He stands up, slapping his ass to get the dust out of his pants. 

“Hello! My name is Henry Thorvaldsen. I want to make you an offer.” I point at the no solicitation stickers on my mailbox and door. He hands me a business card, “Give me a call when you have time.” He gets into his corvette and drives off. I smirk, placing the business card into my wallet. I enter my house, kicking my shoes off.

I pull out my iPad and Bluetooth keyboard. I’m a writer, an incredibly distracted writer. If I am near WiFi, I will spend the rest of the day watching YouTube and reading Reddit. To get work done, I have to be in a cabin or in the 1980s, where WiFi doesn’t exist. However, power outlets exist, so I can type on my tablet at one hundred percent battery without any distractions.

I find enjoyment in writing modern-day articles in the ’80s. I am waiting till the 90’s so I can start watching Seinfeld. Unfortunately, that time machine is only set at 42 years. I can’t change the device to go up or down. The creator must have considered the possible dangers of going forward or backward. I live in two different worlds that are 42 years apart. 

It’s nice to live in my old house. It’s a bit different from what I remember, but I will move out before my parents get married. They’ll change it up a bit more. This Thorvaldsen fellow wants to buy the land for his destructive drilling project. He caused my parents to foreclose on their dream house. I am going to stop him.

September 6, 2022, I head back to work through the time machine. Coincidentally, I am working at that prick’s drilling company. I entered the elevator, and he was waiting for me there.

“Hello. Hey, uh,” he says as I pretend not to recognize him, “you seem familiar.”

“Oh. Er, who are you again?”

“I’m Henry Thorvaldsen and-”

“Oh! Hello! Sorry I didn’t recognize you.”

“It’s alright.”

My act work. The rest of the elevator ride was silent. I’m sure he doesn’t remember me from 1980. He’s 42 years older and has the memory of an old coot.
