I'm always supposed to arrive home before I go out. I had to make my Mom sure I made it back from school, but today I had to break that rule. I found out that the whole world had turned into zombies from my bus driver, who wanted to grab my backpack before I could step off the bus. My best friend Jerry was able to distract the driver, and he released his hand from my bag. I ran to the back of the bus.

Jerry exited the back of the bus through the emergency exit. "I always wanted to do that." We were the last two to get off the route, and all the others were lucky. I told Jerry that I needed to go home no matter what. He replied to me, ""Are you kidding me?"

"I'm not! Mom has to know that I made it back."

"Jesus Christ. Fine." Jerry said.

We arrived back at my house. It was an exhausting mile we had to cross. Thankfully, no one was outside. I rushed inside my house and yelled for my Mom. There was no answer. I skirted around the backyard, looking to see if she was gardening, and instead, she was devouring my sister! I couldn't help but shout as my Mom's attention was now on me. A hand clasped my shoulder, and I turned around to find that it was my dead Dad back from the grave. 

I screamed for help, and the hand got tighter. Dad's jaws were about to meet my head until a rake smacked him on the skull. "Get the hell away from my friend, Bastard!" As if I had forgotten the travesty of my situation, I was about to chide my friend for his language. Thankfully my mother made a bone-chilling groan, capable of stopping whatever my following remark was going to be. Jerry grabbed my hand and yanked me through the house as my family slowly chased me. 

We made ground and caught our breath. "That was terrifying," Jerry exclaimed.

"I never thought they would be so slow."

"Turns out that the number one zombie movie rule came out to be true."

"At least we can outrun them."

"We can outrun one or two, maybe."

"What do you mean by that?"

"I've figured something out. Every adult in the world turned into a zombie. The Bus Driver, and your parents. Even your Dad came back."

Jerry's words showed me that things were about to become more of a headache. All I wanted to do was to go home and play video games. Now, I have to figure out how to survive a zombie apocalypse. It's like the movies, only that I am not confident enough to make it through to the end. We went to an abandoned "Haunted" house to hide in while we planned how to survive the next few days.

Jerry sat in front of a board, thinking up a few scenarios on how to get help. This is why Jerry and I know each other well. He's the thinking type. Capable of coming out of a problem without a headache. The issue is that you wouldn't be able to tell what he's thinking. He can stare at a math problem for minutes and tell you the answer without showing you the math.

"This isn't good," he murmured as he stared at the whiteboard. His handwriting is all over the place. I'm struggling to cope with how he even wrote all of this.

"What is it?" I asked him.

But there wasn't an answer. I had to take my mind off the situation, but I couldn't. Even a walk around the once-spooky house didn't calm my nerves. Life was getting more complicated for me, and I started to curse the situation for how it turned out. I followed all the rules. Why did I deserve to be punished like this? All I wanted to do was have a peaceful life. Instead, I wanted to hang out with my crush, play lots of video games, and show my teacher that I wasn't like my grades. 

But it's not too late. I can save the world. My sister may have been dead, but I can save her too. Zombies exist! So that means anything is possible. I have Jerry, and he can solve any problem out there. I rushed inside the house and yelled at Jerry, and he responded with,

"We're fucked."
