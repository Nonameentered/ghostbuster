Case Report #1: Viridian City Gym Leader

Years ago, several Gym Leaders were using their establishments as fronts for a criminal organization known as Team Rocket. Team Rocket sold stolen Pokémon in Celadon City’s Game Center. The Game Center promoted teen gambling, prompting Red to shut down the facility. This is the first case of a Maverick Champion, an independent kid who makes his way to becoming the Pokémon champion. 

Typically, champions are adults, but due to extraordinary circumstances, Red’s mother let her son travel without regard for the dangers. So after taking down the criminal organization, Red traveled outside the country, rarely seen again except for events where trainers gathered. 

Case #2: The Arrival of the New Bark Town Maverick and Revival of Team Rocket.

Another Ten year old became the Champion three years after the events of Kanto. Gold, hailing from New Bark, stopped the events of the Radio Station hijacking by Team Rocket. Although the latest uprising was incited by resentful zealots who wished for Giovanni’s return, they were left with no answer. Unrelated but oddly coincidental, Silver is an associate of Gold, though only through random encounters where they cross places in their Pokémon journey. 


Further questioning from Silver left no answers on where Gold headed after defeating the Elite four. Unfortunately, the investigation was cut due to the events in Hoenn.

Case #3: The Natural Disasters and impactful words of the Maverick Champion.

Ruby and Sapphire from Little root stopped the quarrels between Team Aqua and Magma. Why two teams go by the name of “Team Something” is beyond me. This isn’t the radical ideas of Team Rocket influencing others. Many criminal organizations started similarly naming their groups. 

The events of Hoenn have impacted the world. Not through the recent natural disasters either. As if it was a fad, beauty competitions appeared where people competed with their Pokémon. This was gone in less than a year, with no one continuing the new hobby. Unbeknownst to local news organizations, the words of Ruby and Sapphire are capable of changing regions, even the swimming patterns of Feebas. This effect is noticeable in Dewford town, where we sent our agents to question both Ruby and Sapphire.

Conclusions:

After gathering a control group of Maverick Champions, some odd natures indicate the supernatural presence of a Maverick Champion. Each example was compelling. The Champions acted the same. They were quiet, only answering yes or no to questions. Most of them often walked into houses to talk to people, and not a single person was left out of the conversation. Each Champion had a unique set of tools for their job, ranging from a PokeFlutes to Red or Blue Orbs.
