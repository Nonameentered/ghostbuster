The Guild Member takes a moment to process Bob’s question, and then she answers,

“What can I say? Your story moved me. I wanted to make sure you would return to adventuring.”

“I gave up the party business long ago.”

“We know you want to return to your group.”

“They don’t want me back.”

“Even if the Necromancer threatens your friend’s pursuits, you would stay here?”

“I didn’t say that.”

“What do you mean?”

“I’m going to the necromancer alone. I’m going to stop him myself.”

“Are you crazy? That’s how you died.”

“I couldn’t care less. My friends don’t trust me to lead them anymore.”

“And how would you get your rifle back?”

“I’m making the journey to the Cave of Eon. There I can find Elixirium, the final component for the barrel of my gun.”

“At least try to talk to them. One more time.”

“I’m afraid that I cannot do that. I don’t have time.” With Bob’s final words, the man leaves the Guild Member alone in his shop. With Bob gone, the Guild Member pulls out a mirror and says,

“I wasn’t able to secure the leader. He’s heading out to the Cave of Eon.”

“This is going to be harder then, but still achievable. Drastic measures must be taken. Send the members to the Academy and Paladin Society.”

In the Cave of Eons, Bob is scaling a giant wall. His arms soaked in sweat, with Bob starting to lose his sanity, speaking to himself.

“Damn, necromancers. Why can’t they leave me alone? No! I have to take my revenge on society! Oh god, bless this a-hole. GIVE... IT... UP... URGHH”

He throws his last leg over the wall and rolls on the ground, exhausted. He continued his fussing.

“Stupgoing toild Member. You’re gonna die! OH NO! What would I ever do without a sniper?! There are a hundred other bowmen out there. A Bow and Arrow is easier to make than a sniper rifle! Elixerium! Elixerium! I mean! It’s easier to open a million treasure chests, like what the Guild Member said. HAHHAHAHA. I’m AN IDIOT. A SELFISH, A-HOLE IDIOT.” Bob starts to break down crying.

“Why… why… I made one mistake. Just one fucking mistake.” Then a voice.

“God. You’re pathetic.” Bob’s head swivels to see the Old Necromancer.

“What are you doing here?”

“I’ve always been with you.” Bob sits up, embarrassed at the Necromancer witnessing his mental breakdown.

“Why are you following me?”

“Why do you still go into dungeons alone?”
