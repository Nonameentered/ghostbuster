The heist team needed to have supernatural skills. Since luck is a superstitious trait, I have to rely on ideas that are not physical. I’m able to gather four people to fit this role. They quickly hopped on as I told them I would pay well, assuming that this would go off without a hitch.

The first individual is a theologian, a person who studies religion. Luck is reliant on outside forces. There’s a long history involved with chance, and in my interview with Micheal, he seems to know quite a bit about it. From the goddesses of luck or the numerous rules involving it.

Then there’s the Poker Player. He’s rude and shady, but he’s efficient. He has shown me his skills earlier by scamming me earlier for some cash to gamble on. There’s previous experience from him working at big casinos, so he knows the ins and outs of probabilities, which factor in luck.

The next member of our team is Crystal, the medium. The plan is to have her apply as a receptionist, and then she uses her magic to swipe the luck for ourselves. I’m worried that she’s batshit crazy and willing to steal it all for herself. Thankfully she has eyes for the Poker Player.

The final member is the lawyer, who will defend us in court. The down payment was harsh, but I wanted the best defense possible. He’s a bullshitter like the Poker Player, but he’s got a degree. That makes him a professional bullshitter, and with a scenario about stealing all the luck, we’ll need all the bullshit we can get.
