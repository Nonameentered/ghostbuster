A small bee enters the kindergarten classroom, and Connor, the exchange student, is afraid of bees. The pointed insect is making his way around the school, landing on and stinging him. Connor's hand darts into his pocket and grabs his ray gun, blasting the insect to oblivion, revealing his identity to the classroom. The whole class, including the teacher, stared at Connor wide-eyed at what had just happened.

Earth's Atmosphere, A ships orbiting the sun, monitoring Connor's progress.

A group of researchers noticed the recent events in the classroom situation.

"Yeah. I don't blame him. I, too, would be pissed if a bee stung me."

"Do you just understand what happened?"

"What's the big deal? We'll wipe everyone's memories again."

"We don't have enough memory wipe fluid to wipe a whole classroom."

"Why haven't we made more yet?"

"Because Connor keeps blowing his cover."

"Something seems off."

"What do you mean?"

"There's always a bee around Connor."

"Computer, play all the instances in which Connor's identity was exposed." The computer beeps and says,

{Playing Scenario 1}

The crew sees Connor shopping at a grocery store; he ends up in the sweetener aisle and attempts to grab a bag of cane sugar but accidentally picks up some honey.

"Oh shit!" Connor exclaimed before pulling out his ray gun.

The crew looks at each other.

"There wasn't even a bee. Was he really afraid of a jar of honey?"

{Playing Scenario 2}

The monitor shows Connor working at a wildlife facility. He's feeding some of the animals and cleaning up the area. He strolls to a tree to take his lunch break, eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. As he bites into it, a bee lands on his hand.

"AHHHHHHHHH!" Connor shouted before his coworkers entered to laugh at it. "It's not funny! They're poisonous to my species!"

"Species? Hah hah hah. What are you talking about, man?"

The video ends, and the computer loads up the next one.

"Well, at least we were able to convince them that Connor was a lunatic. Saved some memory wipe fluid here."

{Playing Scenario 3}

The camera shows both the Men's bathroom and the Woman's bathrooms. You can hear a muffled shout from the Woman's restroom as a lady sprints out of the room, with Connor following closely.

"You pervert!"

"It was a mistake. Look! Look. I'm sorry, I'm not even a human," in a panic, Connor deactivates his cloaking tech. "See!"

The video cuts and starts thirty seconds later, displaying an ashamed Connor with a red slap mark on his skin. The crew is silent, collectively wondering why they even picked Connor in the first place.

In the Bosses office, Connor's awaiting his punishment from superiors. Connor starts, 

"Listen, man. I'm on to something."

"You failed a total of ten times, Connor. Therefore, this position is not the right fit for you."

"Someone is sending bees to attack me."

"That's ridiculous. Listen, I understand adapting to a new environment isn't easy, so that's why we're making you change careers."

And before you know it, Connor is sitting next to a wall, head pressed on his knees.

Out there, undetectable to the Galactic civilization's eye, is a hive mind. One infantry soldier makes his way to the Queen. "My Highness. I have succeeded."

"You infected the Peon with the toxin?"

"Yes, your highness."

"I've thrown many pawns to shorten their memory wipe fluid."

"Thank you for picking me last then, I guess."

"Soon, we will be able to take control of the galaxy. We will take back the world from humans using alien tech. No one will be able to stop the hive mind."
