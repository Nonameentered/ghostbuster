Imagine a different universe that’s hellbent on getting a high score on a particular individual who goes by Armageddon_20xx. Spirits over this world live through his life over and over because Armageddon is an interesting fellow. He’s a writer, a Redditor, and he watches game of thrones. One can say he is a chill dude.

But even the spirits think that there is more to Armageddon. Who is the perfect Armageddon? What defines him? Who is he? What would he do if his two-sentence stories were turned into a novel? What if he was rich or poor? This is the duty of the spirits to decide on his life.

Today, Armageddon is a writer. We don’t know his future, but we can tell it’ll be huge. Whoever is controlling him now should know this. He’s full of potential and has it within him to succeed. He doesn’t need a writing prompt to tell him that.
