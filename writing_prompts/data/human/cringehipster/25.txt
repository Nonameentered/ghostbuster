Great questions. I wanted to have the whole crew vote to send the lunatic to the phantom zone. The phantom zone would be a safe place for the Lunatic to reside in while they find an alternative plan. Everyone wants to protect their identities, even if the names are not connected. An individual like Lex Luther can deduce which names are the correct ones, starting with Clark Kent then Bruce Wayne and so on. As for the Martian Manhunter, he was reading the mind of the lunatic. Somehow the lunatic's powers hint towards psychic abilities of the mind, and he was able to swap consciousness with Martian Manhunter. Now imagine an individual hellbent on revealing the names of the greatest superheroes with phasing and mind reading powers.
