The spirits of former chosen ones haunt me. That's how I'm told I'm this world's new savior. What a pain. A task force executed the others, and I'm sure I have the same target on my back. All the odds are against me, yet I feel at ease with the world's decision.

Just because I was nominated to play the game of the chosen one doesn't mean that I have to play the part accurately. I'm sloppy seconds, so that's how I will act. I don't owe the world a damn thing, even if I was one of its appointees. Instead, I will not end up dead like the other chosen because I have a plan.

Once the task force got wind of my promotion, I headed straight to them. I can feel my 'ancestors' disgust as I turned myself in, but on the opposite end, the task force was delighted to hear about my compliance. They led me into a room where I conversed with a sociable interrogator eager to hear my opinion about my new role. The first time that has happened to me since I received my promotion.

"Thank you for coming in when you discovered this." The man said. In response, I nodded and waited for my chance to speak. "But, what made you come here? Even with the threat of death, it's odd that you would rush over here after learning of your fate." A smile starts to creep on my face,

"I thought of it as an opportunity." The man leaned back in his chair, baffled.

"How?"

"You spend millions of dollars a year hunting down guys like me, right?"

"That is correct."

"Pay me half that."

"Just half?"

"Yup. I thought about the whole million-a-year thing, but it's more than I could ever spend. In exchange, I won't go on toward the grand quest that my soul is aching for. Oh! And you won't have to kill me either."

"Because then there would be a new chosen one to take your place."

"Exactly, you save half a million a year. You get to continue with your corrupt totalitarian system, and I enjoy being a rich asshole under your supervision." I stand up and offer my hand to the man, "I know you got superiors to talk to and whatnot, but you look like the type of guy who could get my proposal accepted. So, do we have a deal?"

And within the week, I was eating fine dining under the spiteful gazes of previous grudging employees.
