For a week, we mourned for him. Our hero is dead at the hands of the corrupt kingdom. We didn't talk to each other at all. We were worried about the rest of the kingdom hunting us down, as they did with the hero. Now I'm alone, back in the village where I met him. 

It was exciting back then, but reliving those memories was painful. For some reason, I can't shake it. I want him to return before all things go to hell. The inn where I first met him was now dull and meaningless. Drinking never filled the gap. I never noticed how lifeless it was without my party. I wonder how they are doing. 

I can't meet them, though, as I'll endanger them. So I noticed my drink was empty, and I asked, "Another one, please."

"Get me one too!" A pat on the back, and I hear a familiar voice. It's the hero!

"What are you doing here?"

"I came from another world. I can easily come back."

"What!" I couldn't believe it. He's back.

"Where're the others?"

"Hiding."

"Ah. I understand."

"How did you come back?"

"I died in my other world."

"Wait, does that make you immortal?"

"I believe so."

"That's freaking crazy, man!"

"Makes it easy for me."

"Because you can't die, right?"

"Yeah. It's hilarious that the other world thought I came back from the dead. I wish I could've seen the look on their faces when I got ran over again."

In the corrupt kingdom, a newly crowned King ponders his orb. Finally, a man walks into his throne room, wearing modern attire.

"It's done. Easier this time." The trucker takes cash from the king and leaves.
