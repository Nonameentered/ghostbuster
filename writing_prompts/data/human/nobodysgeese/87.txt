I love this story. You've got a real talent for descriptions, and I don't know if I've ever enjoyed a story with this many descriptions quite so much. 

One thing to consider is that you put all of main character's history at the beginning and then focus on the little girl. If you wanted to strengthen the sense of nostalgia or loss, you could split things up more, with the main character remembering whoever they lost mixed in with the parts about the girl.
