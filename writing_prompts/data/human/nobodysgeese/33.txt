**The Legend of Stabby Joe**

Joe was a fan of first aid. No one remembered when it started, but by the time Joe was three, he knew that his calling was in the glamorous world of first aid instruction.

Joe loved teaching CPR, the *whump whump* of lungs squishing, and the *crunch crunch* of ribs snapping, and the beat of *Another Bites the Dust* pounding to set the pace of the compressions. He was proud of his perfect record; in all his years of teaching, his students' practice dummies remained just as alive as when they started.

Joe loved teaching about strokes, the slumping and not panicking and dialing 911. He loved teaching about cuts and lacerations, the cleaning, the bandaging, and the dialing of 911. He loved teaching about how to check for poisons, and how to notice broken bones, and how to dial 911 if someone had either, and especially if they had both.

Most of all, Joe *loved* 911.

But what Joe didn't love was teaching was the first rule and first step of first aid. Every time, he'd ask the class,

"Imagine the scene. You come across a man collapsed on the sidewalk, and blood is pumping out of his back. There's a knife laying beside him. What's the first thing you do?"

And every time—*every time!*—the students would give stupid answers like "apply pressure to the wound with the cleanest material available," or "check the victim's airway, breathing, and circulation," or "dial 911." And every time, Joe had to tell them, even the ones who wanted to call 911, that they had died. Whoever stabbed the victim had decided to stab them too, because they hadn't bothered to check if the scene was secure.

He drilled it into them. If a victim had collapsed, *check the scene first* to see if there was a reason. If someone was suffering from a migraine, *check the scene first* to see if an external factor had caused it. If someone was drowning, *check the scene first* to see that there wasn't a flotation device nearby before letting the person drown on their own.

"Remember," he'd retold them (but they never remembered), "you're trying to help people. You *are* people. Your personal safety is the most important thing. While you're helping people, don't become one of the people needing help."

And they'd nod and agree and promise to never forget, and then the little liars would go and forget everything the first time they provided first aid.

It was the newspaper article that was the final straw. Joe was drinking his morning coffee while reading the paper, and then he was spitting his coffee across the headline that hooked him, *First Responder, Second Victim*. 

Words jumped out at him, "Hit and run", "performed CPR in the middle of the street", and "second hit and run". Joe sighed and got some scissors to cut out the article, to show another grisly example to his classes. Then he saw it. The picture.

He recognized the second-rate first-aider smiling in that picture! He'd taught her everything she'd forgotten. He remembered her last class perfectly.

"And class," he'd said, "what's the first rule for first aid?"

There was the usual chorus of "remember your first aid kits," (morons) and "you don't need to do breaths during CPR if you aren't comfortable," (correct, but hardly the first rule) and "call 911." (He was at least a little proud of those people, wrong though they were.)

But that day, one voice said, "check the scene first."

And Joe had smiled at that girl, the one smiling in the picture, and he'd told her, "Very good! Always check the scene first. Do you promise?"

And she'd smiled back at him, like she was probably smiling now, what with rigor mortis, and said, "I promise. I'll always check the scene first."

Joe crushed the newspaper article in a shaking fist. Joe drank his coffee, even though it was cold. And then Joe snapped.

Joe found a mask.

Joe found a knife.

Joe found a dark alley.

And Joe stabbed.

It only took five minutes for the first first-aider to arrive, mumbling to himself, "Stab wound, that's, um, chest compressions? Or was it icing and elevation? Or-"

Stab.

The second first-aider screamed, eyes widening, and Joe felt a moment of hope before she reached into her purse and said, "Siri? Is it FAST or RICE for stab wounds?"

Stab.

The third first-aider rushed in too, saying, "It's been a while since I was the holder of an unexpired first aid license, but I'm still allowed to do my best under Good Samaritan laws, and-"

Joe wasn't sure if that was right, but really, who cared if it was true or not? Instead, Joe said, "You should've been a Better Samaritan."

Stab.
