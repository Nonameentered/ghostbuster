Their 'secret' conversation took place in a bathroom, where my omniscient gaze never strayed in less sleep-deprived moments. Sid Kyck leaned forward. "Cho, your last letter was suspiciously short. What's been going on?"

Cho Zenwan leaned against the door, relaxed. "Nothing's happening, it's just been slow."

Sid sighed. "You're missing the point. *It's been slow.*" He stared at her meaningfully. Cho flinched as realization belatedly dawned upon her like an arthritic sunrise. Hmm. The pace *had* been dragging. I'd need to fix that soon.

"We hadn't- I just- It was *nice* not nearly dying. I'd almost gotten used to it." And I sympathized with that point of view. But exceeding physical and mental limits was crucial for any main character, and I'd even written her a therapist. That Dr. Trey Torr had swiftly stabbed her in the back didn't detract from my original good intentions.

"Calm down," Sid murmured. "We should have some time, and now we have a plan too."

Cho gulped. "Right. The character development checklist." I choked on my coffee. The what? I didn't plan to write that.

"Step one," she continued. "Family, malignant and benign. Author got the parents first, the adoptees and originals. None had other kids, and Author's already killed three fakes, so I think closely related deaths are played out." Just for that, I was tempted to give her a evil second step-mother-in-law, once removed. But she was right, and variety was chicken soup for my author's soul, just like suffering was for hers.

Sid gestured south, I wasn't sure why. "Between the fire and raiders at your village,"—oh right, I'd forgotten about writing that—"all your first and second cousins are dead, and the grandparents are even deader, the good *and* evil ones." He gave a shaky smile. "I don't want to jinx it, but I think Author's finally run out of relatives." Arrogant twit. Why'd I ever give him so much snark?

"Great! Step two, friends, both good and... evil." Cho's voice fell at the end of the sentence, as she remembered the very recent, very violent reason for her current dearth of friends. That was a good chapter.

Sid cleared his throat awkwardly. "Right. I haven't turned evil, and I'm still playing up the comedy relief, so I'm Author-proof right now." Supercilious buffoon. Even worse, he was right. Still, he was getting a fever next chapter. No, *all* the fevers.

He continued. "Step three, enemies. Unless I'm forgetting someone, all dead or imprisoned. So... we're good? Author's got nothing personal to throw at you, and your character's been fully developed?"

I glared and chugged back my third coffee of the night. Or possibly the hour. Either way, it was enough caffeine to cross the line from sleep-deprivation to brilliance, and I smirked.

"Oh Sid, you're *right*," I crooned, keyboard a-clacking. "*Her* character's fully developed. But I think it's time Sid Kyck had a Sidquest of his own kyck off. Time for the orphan to meet his long-lost, villainous mother."
