**Silence in the Audience**

With dancing fingers, you adjust the dials on the sensor array. The anarchic hiss of the cosmic microwave background is almost buried beneath the tortured scream of a black hole's radiation, but among them, you can almost hear... 

It was never in the same place, and you were not meant to understand where it would reveal itself again. But after twenty years, you have a stochastic feeling for it, a sense of the logic, or perhaps the lack of logic, that guides its unknowable appearances. You warp from singularity to singularity, following a pattern you could never explain but feel down to your bones.

A forbidden, muffled groan interrupts the celestial harmony, and you curse, spinning about. The navigator is conscious again, struggling against his bonds. You shoot him. 

Regret fills you as the muffled sizzle of your laser disrupts the sound too. But better a brief interruption than an ongoing annoyance. You spare a precious second to survey the bridge, making sure the rest of the crew knows to stay silent. Then you notice that the navigator was the last one alive. 

Strange, you don't remember shooting that many.

Returning to the dials, you pause for a moment, then crank up the volume, until the roar of electromagnetic radiation fills the bridge. A flip of a switch, and the sound comes from every speaker in the vessel, echoing down her corridors and setting the ship's frame vibrating. Hidden amid the noise of a black hole's environment, you hear it.

A single, pure note. Or perhaps several notes, tied so closely together that you cannot imagine them separate. You tried mimicking it away from an event horizon. The violin had come closest, tuned to a dissonant mode. You played it until your fingers bled, until red flowed down the strings and only twisted yellow flesh remained. Your new metal fingers twitch in remembered pain, the omnipresent ache you'd felt when it hadn't worked and you'd been left to hunt the sound through space once more.

But here, at the edge of a black hole, the inimitable note resounds. It would be perfect, you think, if gross matter were not distorting the frequency. You run to the center of the bridge and shove the captain's corpse from his chair to stand on it. There, spaced equally from the speakers in the wall, it's better, as the sound reaches your ears from them all at the same time. But it isn't good enough.

It takes several minutes of frantic, finicky programming to control the atmosphere of the ship from the captain's chair instead of the environmental station, but you dread to leave the ideal spot. Changing the oxygen levels in the ship only makes the interference worse, but raising the argon and turning the CO^2 filters to full makes the sound just a little bit better.

Briefly, you consider if matter itself is the problem, if removing the interference of clashing atoms and molecules will get the sound right. You find your metal finger has made its way onto the button to vent the atmosphere, but you halt yourself at the last second. Even if the air is a violation of the order of nature, getting between you and the purity of the sound, your mortal frame requires those imperfect vibrations to hear the sound at all.

But it isn't good enough.

It is a much easier task to steer the ship from the captain's chair. You nudge your course closer to the edge of the event horizon, from where not even light can escape. Your ears pop as the howl of Hawking radiation grows louder, but that perfect note rises with it. A siren belatedly warns of navigational hazards, and you scramble to kill it. Just a little bit closer.

The ship warps under the gravitational sheer. However, the ship's funeral dirge of bending metal is quiet enough that you can still hear the sound over it, so you ignore it. Just a little bit closer.

The black hole looms to starboard, a blank circle cut out of the night sky, a void that should never be near enough to be visible to the human eye. Just a little bit closer.

The sound, that divine, never-changing melody, finally sings above the background dross. You close your eyes and bask in it, as the engines finally fail and you move just a little bit too much closer.

You think you should be panicking. Instead, you wonder what it will be like to finally find where the music comes from.

The black hole beckons.
