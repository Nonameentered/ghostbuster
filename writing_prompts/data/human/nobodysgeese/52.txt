All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. And the unique unhappiness of Peter's family was their faces.

At fifty everyone has the face he deserves; Peter's only took fifty months. A poetic bully informed Peter his face was red and shaped like Catalonia, exhumed by a drunken grave-robber.

Peter fled to cry in the well-used family growlery. His Big Brother, face grey and France-shaped, told him, "It's another family thing. We lose because we tell ourselves we'll lose."

"What?"

"Next time, insult his shirt back. I'll teach you how."

He loved Big Brother.
