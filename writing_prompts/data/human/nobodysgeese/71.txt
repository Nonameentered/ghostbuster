If you're looking for different types of prompts, there's a few things you can do.

First, keep in mind that you can write for older prompts. If a prompt is more than three days old, you can share your story in a new post, rather than as a comment, using the [PI] tag, which stands for Prompt Inspired. [Here's the instructions on how to do that.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/how_to_tag_prompts/#wiki_pi.3A_prompt_inspired) So if you find older prompts inspire you, you can still write for them and have people read the stories.

Second, there is a tag, [RF], that stands for Reality Fiction, basically, ideas set in the real world. It isn't used much, but if you're willing to post the stories as a [PI], you will find prompts that are not based on fantasy or sci-fi. [Here's a link to stories tagged RF.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/search?q=flair%3A(Reality%20Fiction)&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)

Third, if you really want a bunch of a certain type of prompt, you can post a [PM], which stands for Prompt Me. You give a set of guidelines in your post, and people will give you prompts that fit it. [Here are the rules for that.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/how_to_tag_prompts/#wiki_pm.3A_prompt_me). The main two are that you need to have written at least one story on the subreddit before, and you have to write a story for the PM within six hours of posting. However, you don't have to write for every prompt people give you, and after that first story, you can take as much time as you like.

Fourth, there's a page called [Mod's Choice](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/mod-choice-prompts), where the mods collect their favorite prompts that they come across. The prompts there tend to have a greater variety.

I hope this helps!
