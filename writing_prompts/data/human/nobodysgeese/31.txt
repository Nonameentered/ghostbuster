The rat crept through the shattered glass door of the McDonald and scurried through the weeds for the cover of the counter. The rat sometimes missed humans—they certainly left more food lying around than the zombies did—but it was an absolutely *joy* to be able to enter any building he pleased whenever he did smell food. The zombies certainly didn't seem to mind.

A gurgling, muffled scream, swiftly cut off, came from the other side of the counter, and the rat poked his head around the corner. He gave a pleased squeak when he saw a zombie tearing out a human's throat, half-eaten burger still clench in its mouth. It was always nice when the zombies cleared a building out first. The rat considered running for the burger, but zombie eating involved enough thrashing about amid the rotting pickles and tomatoes that he might be accidentally crushed. He settled down for a wait, content in the knowledge that there would be a meal at the end of it.

It didn't know when it began to think. One moment, it had been dead—or perhaps lifeless, for it had never been alive to begin with—and the next, it could feel. There was little in the way of thought, only an all-consuming hunger that it did not recognize as such, for it had never eaten.

But it did have instincts. When tiny teeth began to nibble on the corner of it, it struck, enveloping its attacker, the prey become predator. What it would later learn were organs and flesh and fur and bones were engulfed and dissolved. The legs were of particular interest to it. As it lay upon the McDonald's floor, and no further prey came, the memory of the rat came to it again and again. It had...

The rat had *moved*. 

Slowly, it extended a tendril, succeeding in tipping itself over. It grew another, opposite the first, and managed a slow drag. A third and a fourth, and it was moving in a semblance of a gait, swiftly become steady and sure-footed.

The cheese from the cheeseburger, bitten by a zombie and plagued by the same never-ending hunger, was on the hunt.
