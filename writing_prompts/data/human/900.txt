You have but one superpower, the ability to completely heal the injuries and ailments of those around you, and yet you have become the world's most notorious supervillain.
In the land of the dead, a healer is a bad thing. 

I accidentally made a vampire explode trying to heal his cut. The elder lich to his left tried attacking me, but was so badly hurt by a simple touch that she ran off. And then there was the incident with the zombie hoarde. I didn't know that healing a sodding zombie would make it loyal! 

And then the spirits started to come to me. They wanted either deliverance or residence. I jokingly said I needed an empire first so that they could haunt somewhere in peace while I tried. Didn't realise they and the zombies took this to heart and started planning. The next thing I knew, I had angry dead and undead attacking me, and a body count higher than Dracula (he sent his congratulations ). And an empire. 

In the land of the dead, a healer can be a very bad thing.
