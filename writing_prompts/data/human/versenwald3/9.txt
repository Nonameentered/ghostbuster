MORTAL, DO YOU KNOW THE RULES?

His brow furrows in confusion. "Of course I know the rules. Even a child could play such a simple game."

NO, NOT THAT. THE RULES OF THE WAGER.

"Well, if I win, I get a second chance at life. If you win, you reap my soul and that's the end of it all."

AND WHAT OF A TIE?

"I assumed we would go on playing until there was a winner," he admitted.

YOU ARE CORRECT.

The silence stretched on. He fidgeted, tapping the pencil erratically against the side of his leg. 

I waited. Sometimes, it took a moment.

There was an imperceptible widening of the eyes before an expression of black despair blanketed the man's features. I watched as realization came crashing down on the young man. He had been so obsessed with his goal - avoiding death - that he had not thought about what it would entail.

THE LAST MORTAL I PLAYED TIC-TAC-TOE WITH LASTED 103,402 GAMES BEFORE THEY LOST ON PURPOSE. DO YOU TRULY WANT TO DO THAT TO YOURSELF?

His shoulders slumped. There was a resigned mumble.

COME AGAIN?

"...I choose chess."
