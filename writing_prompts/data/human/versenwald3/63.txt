"Damn it!" Ailuin drew her tail around her body as she began to shrink. Her pile of gold was still gloriously large, still sparkled beautifully as the rays of sunlight glinted off of the many coins. But she knew that it did not matter.

It was the *value* that counted. She remembered what the enchantress had said to her. "Your greed knows no bounds, Lady Ailuin, and so your existence shall be bound by your own wealth. Gold-hungry as a dragon, a dragon you shall be. When your accumulated wealth holds no more value, you shall cease to exist."

Ever since, she'd wandered the lands in her serpentine form. She'd dragged a small bundle of gold coins with her when she left her home, but she'd only been the size of a small lizard, then. Ailuin knew that she would have to travel quickly, and travel light. If her husband came home, and found her the way she was...well, knights slew dragons. Everyone knew that.

After many months of long and weary travel, she had found her cave. When she'd been smaller, Ailuin had been able to steal into the small town that was two days' flight away. She'd stolen coins, jewels, family heirlooms. Though quickly, she had realized most family heirlooms held little to no value.

When she had grown larger, Ailuin threatened the villagers, demanded yearly tributes. She was nearly as large as a small house, now. Nothing could stop her. She would amass all the wealth in the world. She would be Queen of everything.

Over the years, she learned that what was most reliable was *gold.* It was called the gold standard for a reason, Ailuin mused. In five hundred years, its price had rarely fallen. When it had, she'd only needed to wait a few years to watch its price rise back up to where it belonged.

Ailuin huddled into a miserable pile, shivering. She wouldn't lie. Even though the price always came back up, each time to the value of gold fell, a pit of cold fear gnawed at the fires in her belly. Would the price fall to nothing? Would gold ever be *worthless*? Would Ailuin cease to exist?

Three days later, she was no larger than a wolfhound. Ailuin crept cautiously out of her cave. Something extreme must have happened in the world. Something that could have quartered the value of gold in less than a week. She cast her eyes over the valley, trying to pinpoint what it could have been.

She was too far away from civilization to tell. The grass was still a luscious green, the river a pristine blue. Ailuin gathered a few gold coins, slipped them into the small cloth pouch that was tied securely around her throat, and took flight.

The town of Brinoa was full of life. Or at least, at first glance. Perched on one of the roofs, Ailuin spotted hundreds of townspeople ambling through the streets. Her eyes narrowed with suspicion. Her dragon sight picked out their sickly pallor, the glazed-over eyes, the blood trickling from open wounds. 

Something had happened to these people. Something bad. 

As she had the thought, the world around her grew even larger. She was shrinking again. Frantically, Ailuin flapped down to the streets, searching for someone, anyone, who could stop her plight.

Unluckily for her, one of the ambling townsfolk smelled her scent and turned down the alley she had chosen. He wobbled towards her, hands outstretched, mouth gaping...

A large wooden club smashed his face wide open. He crashed to the ground, then lay there, unmoving.

The boy who had swung the club looked at Ailuin with wide eyes. "Holy shit," he breathed. "Are you Ailuin of the Yellow Flame? What *happened* to you?"
