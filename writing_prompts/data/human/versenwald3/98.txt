My mother always told me that life was a symphony, and I was the conductor. Ever since I was young, I orchestrated my life with care. A 4.0 GPA in high school,  filled with all the necessary extracurriculars. Acceptance to Harvard on the pre-med track. It was hard work, but I spent many hours studying, aiming for the medical school acceptance that would open up space for 3 more variations: classwork, internship, and residency.

Then, the car accident happened. I was in a coma for six months, and the violins in my orchestra held their bows above the strings, watching the conductor, waiting to see if it was a fermata or a finale.

When I awoke, everything was different. Every time I was near someone, I realized I could hear echoes of their music in the background.

Maya was a Viennese Waltz, upbeat and elegant, always taking in the swells and dips of life with poise and grace. Damian, loud and determined, was a pounding EDM track that relentlessly drove the beat forward, never looking back.

And my mother's soundtrack was not a symphony, but a playlist of simple piano music. Claire de Lune. Moonlight Sonata. Caring and gentle, always urging me to rest and have a semblance of a life between my rigorous classes.

But when I returned home for winter break during the third year of medical school, the house was eerily quiet. No soft piano melodies floated up to greet me, and my heart pounded with trepidation. I rang the doorbell, fearing the worst.

My mother opened the door. She hadn't changed much over the last year - her black hair tucked into a messy bun, her eyes glowing with warmth, the lopsided smile that spread across her face. Perhaps there were a few more wrinkles creased into the edges of her smile, perhaps a few more strands of white were in her dark locks. But for the most part, she looked the same.

The music, though.

The music was different.

My skin crawled. Two chromatic notes, going back and forth and back and forth again. It was strange, how simple sounds could evoke such a visceral reaction. My mother's new theme was the Jaws soundtrack.

The very next day, I took her to the doctor. She protested, insisting nothing was wrong.

"Brian, la! We only have a week before you go back to school. Let's enjoy it and not spend all our time in a doctor's waiting room."

But my suspicions had been correct. I met with Dr. Woodward after we received the results, and he gravely gave me the full report.

"I'll be honest," he said, peering over his glasses. "I thought this was a case of classic medical student syndrome. You hear about something in your classes, you think you and everyone around you's got it. But your mother hasn't been to see a doctor in quite a few years, and she's been overdue for a colonoscopy either way, so I agreed."

In many ways, the Jaws soundtrack was quite fitting. Her body was consuming itself, the malignant cells diverting all energy away from the healthy ones. The doctor said they would begin treatment as soon as possible, but it was quite likely that she would only have a few months left.

It was clear what I had to do.

The sostenuto of my symphony began. I took a leave of absence from medical school to care for her throughout her treatment. Each prolonged moment, each interaction, I stored away in my memory. I hoped that we had caught it early enough and that she would recover. But if we hadn't - if there was truly only two months left - I wanted them to last as long as possible, to treasure each waking moment.
