"It's about yea big?" Martin held his hands out in front of him, trying to approximate the size of the thing. To be honest, once he'd made it, he'd never paid too much attention to it. It was weird, staring at one's own physical manifestation of mortality. Gave him the heebie jeebies.

Looking back, he supposed that was how it had gotten lost. He should have known better. He *really* should have known better.

He should never have let Deirdra "straighten up a bit around the house, get rid of the odd knickknacks that we're not using." He should have looked through the bag before she'd dropped it off at the center.  He should have done many things, but now it was too late and he could only hope that he could salvage his mistake.

Martin leaned over the counter of Madame Melisandre's House of Unwanted Things. "It's heavier than it looks. Smooth, polished surface that feels like crystal. It's also got a weird color-changing gas inside. It's hard to miss."

Madame Melisandre smiled tightly back at Martin. "I'm afraid we haven't seen what you're describing. Also, when someone makes a donation to us, we have a strict 'no take-back' policy.  Didn't you read the sign?" With a gnarled finger, she pointed lazily at the yellowed parchment posted to the wall.

"*Yes,* I read the sign, but this is an extenuating circumstance. This is a matter of life or death!" Martin's pulse hammered in his chest, reminding him of what was at stake.

"Life or death?" Melisandre arched a painted eyebrow. "How...*interesting*. Do enlighten me, how could a small bauble be the difference between life and death?"

*Damn*. Melisandre could probably smell his desperation, emanating off of him in waves.

"My mother's on her deathbed, and my father gave that trinket to her. She'll die happy if she can see it one more time." Martin hoped that the weak lie would hold muster. Briefly, a panicked thought crossed his mind. Was Melisandre a wizard? Was she simply toying with him before taking his life force?

Frowning, Melisandre turned towards the back rooms and squinted at the heaps of trash bags that were piled upon each other. "I'm not quite sure if you know what the phrase 'a matter of life and death' means, but fine. We haven't finished sorting all the new donations in the backroom, but for a paltry sum of one hundred quid, I'll let you go through them. Maybe you'll find what you're looking for, maybe not. No guarantees."

A hundred quid for immortality? It was an easy deal. Martin whipped out his wallet, slapped the bills on the table, and marched into the backroom.
