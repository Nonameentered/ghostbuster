Being a princess really isn't all that it's cracked up to be. You spend most of your life getting kidnapped or cursed, and when things are going well, the best you can hope for is to be auctioned off like chattel to an eligible royal in a neighboring nation. 

Do I sound bitter? Just a little? Maybe it's because I managed to hit the jackpot of all three.

I was kidnapped by an evil witch with a vendetta against my father (probably because he'd gifted the forest she lived in to some stuck-up nobleman). When Galahad rescued me, with her dying breath, the witch cursed me to perish before I could ever reach adulthood.

It's kind of hard to live your life when you know exactly when you will die, down to the minute. I mean that quite literally. It's seared into my flesh, emblazoned in little red letters across the inside of my right wrist. January 16th, 1384. The eve of my 18th birthday.

And to add insult to injury, my dad issued a royal decree. Whosoever could break the curse would be granted my hand in marriage. So even if I did survive, I'd spend the rest of my life wed to a total stranger. 

Who knows? Maybe I'll get lucky and get a total hottie.

On the other hand, it's more likely that anyone with the arcane knowledge needed to break a curse of this caliber would probably be a wizened old mage forty years my senior. 

Like I said, being a princess really isn't all that great.
