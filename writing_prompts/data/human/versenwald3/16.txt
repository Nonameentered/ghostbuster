Enxa sat in front of the crackling fire, arms crossed, eyebrow cocked. "Am I hearing you right? You're saying that we should save the world?"

Bashuk nodded once.

"Just to be clear, we should save *this* world, the one where almost everyone hates us and wants us dead?"

Bashuk nodded again.

"Let's not even get to the bigger question of how we would even do that. Why should we bother saving this useless, terrible, world?"

Bashuk leaned forward, holding her hands in a pleading gesture. *How to Acquire Allies and Sway Folks* extolled the importance of body language when persuading somebody to take your point of view.

This was Bashuk's one chance to make a good argument. Her one chance to get her friend to take on a crazy, hare-brained adventure with her. Her one chance to convince Enxa that the world was worth saving.

"Well, *we* live here, don't we?"

There was a moment's silence.

Enxa sighed. "Fair point. So, how do we start?"
