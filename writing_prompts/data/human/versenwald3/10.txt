Throughout the millenia, I have seen many types of mortals.

There are the ones who think themselves clever, the ones who have never been vanquished before in the human realm.

There are the ones who pick games of chance instead of skill, preferring to stake everything on a roll of the dice instead of their own abilities.

There are the ones who are defeated before they even make the first move, convinced that they do not stand a chance.

There are the ones who embrace the end, the ones who are ready for what comes next, the ones who don't even wish to challenge me.

And then there are the ones who think they can cheat me.

One such man stands before me now, cheeky grin plastered across his face, pencil and paper gripped tightly in his slender fingers. He's convinced that he's outsmarted me, that he's the one who will be able to beat Death. Mortals think that they're so special, so unique, that they alone have somehow figured out the trick to defeating the natural order of things, but I already know what he's going to say before he even opens his mouth.

"Tic-Tac-Toe," he proclaims.
