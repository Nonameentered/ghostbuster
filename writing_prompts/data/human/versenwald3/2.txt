I've been on and off of WritingPrompts for about five years at this point! I wouldn't say my writing is unique, it's more of a mishmash of authors that inspire me (Douglas Adams, Jonathan Stroud, Terry Pratchett), and my style can wildly vary depending on what I'm currently reading. 

I'm hoping to finish writing more stories. WritingPrompts is great for idea generation and for coming up with cool premises, but I've gotten into the habit of writing a fun beginning and then losing steam! 

Some of my stories can be found at /r/theBasiliskWrites, feedback and comments are always welcome!

I also had a few suggested topics for SatChat as well (sorry if they've been done before!) 

* What is your favorite place to write?
* What resources helped you become a better writer?
