I tried to say no at first, honest to God (wherever the hell he is), I really did. The case had trouble written all over it. And at first, Gabriel wanted me to do it *pro bono*.

"We don't really have any physical money, you know," he'd said. "Kingdom of heaven and all that. Money is an earthly construct. Inspires avarice and deadly sin, right?"

"Purity of heart and goodwill ain't gonna pay my rent, Gabriel," I'd replied.

It felt weird haggling with a giant winged human in my cramped little office, but I got him to agree to $80 an hour. My mentor, Ethan Burns, always told it to me like it was: If you're good at something, never do it for free.

After we'd signed the paperwork, the hunt was on. Gabriel and I sat down and had a nice little chat so I could learn a little more about God. Who he hung out with, his favorite haunts, what he'd talked about before he'd disappeared.

I didn't get many good leads, though. It turns out people don't really ask God about his life much. Gabriel shrugged and said most of his day-to-day interaction with God was passing along prayers or people who were asking for direction or a greater purpose.

Seems like a lonely life, but hey. That's what you get when you sign up to be the big kahuna.

There was some good news, though. Gabriel had combed through every corner of Heaven and Hell, and in both, God was nowhere to be found. *That* meant he was somewhere here on Earth. I'd have been real pissed if I'd needed to die to finish up this case. Would've probably demanded a reincarnation as recompense.

So, to recap: God. On Earth. No real leads. Where could he possibly be?
