Six billion years.

Six billion years of existence, of watching my brothers and sisters burn through their lives before going dark forever. Six billion years of watching civilizations rise and fall. My kind, the star-kin, were not created to make friends. Each one of us harbored a gravitational pull so strong that we could never be near one another. And so, we constructed our own worlds. Worlds that revolved around us, worlds that would be plunged into darkness when our own lives came to an end.

It's exhilarating and painful, being the centre of someone else's universe. I have all the power in the world, but not one being that I can call a friend.

Maybe that's why I began granting wishes. Doling out little miracles, watching people's faces light up, changing lives for the better. It made me happier. And maybe, just maybe, I was hoping that someone on the other side could grant one of my own wishes.

Usually, I don't communicate with any of the wishers. I simply pause, adjust the universe to reflect their wish, and watch as they celebrate. They are left to wonder whether it was simply a stroke of good luck, or whether higher powers truly exist.

But this wish gave me pause.

*Dear Wishing Star,* the girl had said.

*I wish I could go visit you. Ever since I came to the hospital, Mom always sings Twinkle Twinkle Little Star to me each night. It made me wonder, what are you? Are you really up there? And do you ever get lonely?*

I knew that it was not a good idea to get involved. Their lives were short, gone in a blink of an eye. Better to stay up high, granting the occasional wish, keeping a safe distance, not getting too attached.

**Sorry, little girl. But you must pick a new wish.**
