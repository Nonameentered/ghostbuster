Over the years, I've amassed many names. Rava the Invincible. The Demon Slayer of the Fading Realms. The Adventurer of the Ages. The Scarlet Whisper. 

But there is one name that I have not gone by in many moons. Crown Princess Soria of Lutenheim. The name that I was born with.

I won't bore you with the details of my upbringing. As a princess, all that was expected of me was to look pretty, stay quiet, and secure allies for Lutenheim through a politically convenient marriage. It wasn't a future that I wanted for myself, and on my 15th birthday, I decided I would forge my own path.

I've traveled to many worlds, seen many lands, and made a name for myself. But five years later, homesickness struck, and I decided to return to Lutenheim.

Imagine my surprise when I returned, and learned that Princess Soria was getting married to Prince Reynold of Sventland in a fortnight. 

I'd been replaced. But by who? 

I decided to investigate. 

I broke into the palace, slipped into my old chambers, and that's when I saw *it*. My Amulet of True Sight revealed the impostor for what it was - a demon, siphoning life force from all those who surrounded it.
