"Freedom 12? Freedom 12? Please copy, your spacecraft has disappeared from our systems."

The radio crackled with white static. If Freedom 12 was anything like Freedom 11, there would be no further reply.

Professor Davenport shook his head. Another promising bright recruit, lost. He had half a mind to go out there himself to see what all the fuss was about. How were the stars different? Why did they feel the need to get out of the capsule for a closer look? And strangest of all...what was calling them?

The unmanned probes Mark 2 and Mark 3 (Mark 1 had been destroyed in an unfortunate asteroid collision) had collected extensive data on sector Epsilon 99Z, and detailed analysis of all the planetary scans had revealed no traces of life. Freedom 1 had been sent out simply to confirm that the area was inhospitable for human colonization.

But then, the phenomenon had occurred. The pilot had climbed out of the cockpit. Death by asphyxiation. Or at least, that was what Davenport assumed. All biodata from the astronaut had stopped broadcasting the moment the pilot had yanked off the sensors.

Epsilon Syndrome. At least, that's what the psychologists called it. After the third occurrence, they had deemed it worthy of inclusion on the DSM-5. Though the control center was well-heated, Davenport felt chills creeping down his spine.

"Another one gone." Beside him, Dr. Rachel Applewhite shook her head in disappointment. "We should just cut our losses. It's not worth it to waste more lives on this forsaken corner of space. It's not as though we were planning to colonize it, anyhow."

Dr. Davenport cleared his throat. Logically, he knew she was right, but he had invested so many of his most promising students on this fruitless endeavor. It had been many years since he had last donned his astronaut gear, but he was sure he still remembered how to pilot an Explorer.

"I'll go."
