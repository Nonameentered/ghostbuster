The abandoned warehouse of Aura Therapeutics was at the west end of Ebonborough. That had been one of the primary reasons why Optima had chosen this as the meeting spot for the Renegades.

Anyone who decided to look at the setting sun would see the four vigilantes perched at the edge of the highest floor of the building, their silhouettes illuminated by the dying rays. Electrocus, Solar Flare, Optima, and Nightwing.

After years of watching corruption, ineptitude, and apathy of the lowest caliber, the four had decided to take matters into their own hands. Thanks to their efforts, Ebonborough was becoming a safer place to live.

Sometimes, Nightwing wondered if they were being silly, indulging in theatrics like this. But as Optima said, the image of the four of them, united in their quest to clean up Ebonborough, might be able to dissuade some would-be villains.

As the last of the day's light disappeared over the edge of the horizon, Electrocus stood up, stretching languidly. "Good hang out sesh, everyone. See you next month?"

Solar Flare whipped out her phone, swiping through her calendar. "Is that October 2nd?"

Three more phones popped out of pockets.

Optima peered myopically at her screen. "Yep."

"Crap, I can't do that. Got a wedding to go to. I'm at that age, you know. The age when all my friends are suddenly deciding to get hitched. How about the 4th?"

"Can't do that," Nightwing piped up. "My hours at the day job got shifted around, so I won't be able to make it to here by sunset on weekdays anymore. What about the Saturday the 7th?"

"Out of town visiting family," Electrocus interjected. "And then I've got a business trip for the next two weeks to California, so I'm out for pretty much the rest of October."

Optima grimaced. "We can't just skip all of October, guys. People are going to wonder if something's happened to us. If the villains managed to take us down."

"Well, I RSVP'ed to this wedding four months ago, so I definitely can't do the 2nd. Maybe you guys can just do this without me?" Solar Flare said.

"No, we can't! We've got to appear united. We can't be this wishy washy group that's sometimes three people and sometimes four people. Think about the *optics*."

There was a brief silence as the four heroes examined their hectic schedules.

"I think I could *maaaybe* swing October 6th if I can get a coworker to cover for me," Nightwing offered.

"That's my anniversary, Bram and I are going to see a show that night," Optima sighed.

There was another prolonged silence.

"Wait, I think I've got a solution to all our problems," Electrocus said. "To all the citizens of Ebonborough, we're just tiny backlit silhouettes, right? I'll bring Julia. She can stand in for Solar Flare."
