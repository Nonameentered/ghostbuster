The first time, I'd been baffled and a little impressed. How she had managed to summon a fifth-level demon was beyond me. It had taken me nearly four years to master the complex runes for a circle designated for such a powerful creature. I'd put the candles in one of the harder-to-reach cabinets, dropped the chalk into a small glass jar, and booped Fluffy on the nose playfully, telling her not to do it again.

The second time, I put a combination lock on the candles cabinet, transferred all the chalk into an unbreakable plastic container, and kept the matches under lock and key.

After the third time, I threw out all of my candles, chalk, and spellbooks. I could practice my hobby somewhere else, someplace where Fluffy couldn't get to my tools.

When I saw the torn-open Amazon boxes outside my apartment door, I knew what was coming. "Fluffy!" I jerked down on the door handle and pulled, wondering which infernal being would be sitting in my living room today. She'd gotten more and more skilled each time - if this didn't stop soon, I was certain that I would one day stumble upon the Prince of Darkness feeding her wet food straight from the can.

Fluffy meowed at me indignantly. The creature in the corner looked at me and cackled. "She says that you're late." His voice was the screaming of ten thousand innocents. Quickly, I clapped my hands over my ears, but it was too late. A trickle of blood leaked out of my left ear.

"For the *last time*, Fluffy, I can't help it if there's traffic on the way home! If I'm a few minutes late for dinnertime, you can't just go willy-nilly summoning demons to bring you food."
