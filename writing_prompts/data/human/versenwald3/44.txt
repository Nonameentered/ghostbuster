Brian grinned to himself as he chewed on his Wheat Thins. It was a deranged, sickly, grin, the grin of a man who had done unspeakable things to another human being. The grin of a man who, despite all odds, was still walking free.

He'd left Blair bleeding out in her dorm room, knocked out her roommate Kai, and planted the bloody knife into Kai's hands. Even if Kai managed to weasel her way out of a guilty verdict, Brian had a foolproof alibi - he'd been at James's place all night long, playing Halo with the boys. It had been difficult, climbing in and out of the bathroom window, but he'd managed it. Nobody had left James's place all night, at least, not by the front door. Everyone there could vouch for him.

Things were just the way that they should be. Brian would get off scot-free, and Blair would no longer haunt his dreams with her condescending smile.

*Sorry, I'm just not interested in you. No hard feelings, right?*

Brian slammed his fist onto the counter. That stuck-up *bitch*. Was he not good enough for her? Well, if he couldn't have her, then nobody could.

He polished off the rest of his breakfast, shouldered on his backpack, and headed off towards campus. He couldn't *wait* to see the chaos that he'd created.

\---

There was no chaos.

Brian had expected police cars, ambulances, media helicopters, something, anything.

Instead, life at Sleepy Hollow University proceeded as usual - students ambling to class, a couple kids playing frisbee, some of the music geeks jamming out on the quad.

The hair at the back of Brian's neck stood on edge. Something was wrong. Something was very, very, wrong.

And that's when he heard her voice.

"Hey, Brian."
