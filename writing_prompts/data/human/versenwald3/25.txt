This was it. The moment that they had been tirelessly working towards for the past ten years. Viktor turned to Lailah, detonator in hand. 

"With one push of a button, all suffering on earth will end," Viktor said. "Everyone who ever wronged us, everyone who ever looked down on us. All of it will be over."

Lailah smiled at him. "We'll all go out with a bang. You were always a showman, even down to the very end."

Viktor cleared his throat and looked at the floor. "Er. Thanks." 

He'd never been great at accepting compliments, and given how much time the world had left, it looked like he never would be.  

There was an awkward silence.

"Um. So. Did you want to do the honors, then?" Holding out his hand, he offered her the detonator to the doomsday device. *Their* doomsday device.

"Thanks," Lailah smiled again, but was that a trace of sadness in her eyes? As she took the device from him, their hands brushed against each other. For a brief moment, Viktor was glad that Inferno had burned off most of his face during one of their clashes. Otherwise, he was sure he'd be glowing brighter than Rudolph's nose.

"Well, here goes," she said. Her thumb began its downward trajectory, and Viktor's life flashed before his eyes.

Five. Bullied by all the other children orphanage, abandoned by parents he'd never known.

Eight. Recruited by the League of Heroes to risk life and limb for civilians who feared and hated him.

Fifteen. Defected to the Night's Watch to fight against the League.

Twenty-one. A walking third-degree burn after a disastrous affair against Inferno. 

And Lailah. *Lailah.*

She'd saved his life. They'd bonded over their shared hatred of the League, of a world that callously milked superheroes for all that they were worth and threw them to the side when they were spent. Together, they'd dismantle everything. Together, they'd destroy it all.

Lailah's thumb continued to move towards the button.

Twenty-six. They'd moved in together. To save rent, of course. And so that they could work on the doomsday device more effectively. 

Twenty-eight. The year when Viktor finally perfected a brew that kept her nightmares at bay. She'd hugged him so tight that he thought he'd burst from happiness.

Thirty. She'd baked him a cake to celebrate the "big birthday". Carrot cake. His favorite.

She would hit the button soon, and then it would all be over.
