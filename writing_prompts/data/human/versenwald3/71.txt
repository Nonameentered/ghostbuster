Sarah is twelve, now, and she runs around the house with wild abandon, chasing imaginary dinosaurs. Her friends say she's too old to be playing make-believe, but she argues that she's making up for lost time. *You would never have known how close we came to losing her*, her parents say to the neighbors.

Sarah is eighteen, now, and her nose is almost always stuck in a book, reading about the stars. The books tell her that they are giant inanimate balls of gas, but Sarah knows better.

Sarah is twenty-six, now, and when she's stargazing in an empty field, she sometimes zones out for many minutes at a time. When asked about it, she'll smile wistfully. *Just talking to the stars*.

A blink of an eye. 

Sarah is sixty-seven, and every Thanksgiving, her grandchildren gather around the fireside to hear her stories.

Sarah is eighty-four. Her eyes are beginning to cloud, and her memories are beginning to fade.

Sarah is ninety-six years old when she finally makes her wish.

This time, it is granted.
