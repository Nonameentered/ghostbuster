Sienna knows that he will be back soon, and she is scared.

She fingers the slip of paper in her pocket. Sienna remembers shakily copying down the numbers in the bathroom stall of a London nightclub, though she can't seem to recall the name of the club anymore. Later that night, Mary had dared her to call the number, but nobody had picked up. Perhaps it was because Sienna hadn't actually needed help. Perhaps it was because the number didn't exist anymore.

Many times, Sienna has thought about throwing the slip of paper away. *Don't be silly, Sienna. Someone probably wrote it on a dare. Nobody is ever going to pick up.*

But somehow, five years later, she still has the piece of paper. Even laminated it after the ink began smearing and fading away.

*When you need help, call me.*

Sienna takes a deep breath. She dials the number, and waits, nerves aflame.

On the other side, the phone rings. There is a click, and somebody picks up.

"Hello? "I-I think I need help." Tears are streaming down Sienna's face, now. She waits for a reply, hoping against hope that a stranger will help her.

Mary is gone. June is gone. Richard is gone.

*You can't keep letting him treat you this way, Sienna.*

*Your friends hate me, Sienna. You need to cut them off.*

Now, only Alex is left.

On the phone, there is no response. Sienna sets the phone down, heart pounding loudly in her ears. There is nobody. There is nowhere else for her to go. Only Alex, forever and ever and ever.

And then, a voice.

"I'll help you."
