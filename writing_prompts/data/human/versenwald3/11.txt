Raina has tried everything.

Holy water. Spirit mediums. And, when she was at her lowest, Raina even attempted a complex ritual involving chalk, candles, and some animal viscera.

And yet, Melissa is still here.

She floats by the edge of the stairs, with those innocent hazel eyes that haven't aged a single day.

"Mom? Is it time to go to bed already?" Her curly hair sticks out at odd angles, as untamable in death as it was in life.

Raina resists the urge to tuck the unruly strands behind Melissa's ears and forces a smile out instead. "Yes, honey. But before we go to bed, is there anything you want to do?"

Raina has asked the same question for three years in a row, and there's never been a satisfying answer. After all, what kind of unfinished business can a five-year-old really have?

But something is keeping Melissa tethered to the mortal world, and Raina can't figure out how to get her to move on.

And, she thinks to herself, how can she possibly talk about getting Melissa to move on when she herself hasn't moved on at all? Her apartment is a snapshot in time, a static picture of how things used to be when Melissa was alive.

"There's nothing I want to do," Melissa says. "Unless there's something I can do that will make you happy." 

"I am happy," Raina insists. Even as she says the words, she knows how fake they sound. 

"You don't sound very happy," Melissa pouts. "I thought you would be happy if I stayed, but you just look sad."
