"Shit!" Timothy Sanchez, aka the Silver Serpent, paced agitatedly in front of the pearly gates while Saint Peter flipped through his ledger. "You're sure? You're absolutely sure?"

"The ledger's sorted alphabetically, my good man. I've looked under Golden Falcon, William Flint, Will Flint, Bill Flint, Billy Flint, Falcon Flint, and Golden Flint. He's not here."

"And I'm supposed to be here? Are you sure?" Timothy's voice rose in pitch, reflecting his distressed state.

Saint Peter raised an eyebrow. "You are one of two people in the history of the universe to ever ask me that question, and the other was in a Satanic cult. How he got up here is beyond me, but that's neither here nor there. The Lord works in mysterious ways, and we do not make," he tsk'ed distastefully, "*mistakes*."

"Oh, alright, yes, I'm very grateful that the Lord had mercy on me and allowed me to ascend to Heaven where we all wear white and sing hymns at 2 o'clock sharp every day. It sounds absolutely wonderful. The thing is, I've got a *very* important appointment that I am loathe to miss. Is there an elevator or something I can take? I'll just be a moment."

"Is there an elevator? To *hell?* Of course not. Good sir," Saint Peter looked up from his ledger, "if there were, how would we possibly keep the devils out? And I must ask you to step inside, as I've got quite a line to deal with, now."

Timothy begrudgingly stepped through the pearly gates. How had things gone so horribly, terribly, wrong? Each step he took towards paradise, his heart sank a little further.

They were supposed to have ended up *together*. They'd both known that he was irredeemable, so Will had done some unspeakable things to lower his own karmic balance. An eternity of torment didn't seem so bad when you were with someone you loved.

The two of them had been on the run when the other heroes had finally caught up to them. At the very end, Will had smiled, blood gurgling from his lips. With his final breaths, he muttered his last words: "I'll see you in Hell."

Which was the very crux of the problem.

Somehow, Timothy had ended up here.
