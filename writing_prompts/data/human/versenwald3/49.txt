It's been five years.

Minhua knows it's been five years because they come back every year, once a year, always on the same day.

Sometimes, she wishes she could do it all over again. Be back in the hospital with the bleached fluorescent lights, the smell of antiseptic, the checkered tile floor.

At least, back then, there was something that kept them together, a united purpose, a sense of a shared goal.

Now, they are almost strangers. After it was all over, Minhua still remained. She watched as they drifted apart, the threads that held their family together slowly splintering as they shuttered their hearts, alone but so terribly alike in their grief.

Her heart breaks to see it.

Once every five years, and yet, today is different. They are not supposed to come for another five months, but here he is - her eldest, her firstborn, her sunshine child.

He used to be such a bright young boy, full of energy and wonder, illuminating the room with his smile. Now, his steps are heavy as he slowly climbs the front steps, the ones that he once used to take two at a time. Behind him, he carries several large bags.

Slipping out a key, he unlocks the deadbolt and pushes on the door, cursing when it doesn't budge.

Minhua has learned, over the years, that she can influence small things in the world. It takes effort, but she pushes on the second bolt - the one that he always forgets about - and the door slips open. Timothy doesn't seem to notice anything, but Minhua is thrilled with her small victory.

"Just got to clean everything up," Timothy mutters under his breath. "Clean everything up, drop it all off at Goodwill, and put the house on the market. It's not that hard, right? Been putting it off for way too long."

Stepping across the threshold, Timothy kicks off his shoes at the front door and bends down to rearrange them so that they are neatly next to one another. He drops his keys and his phone on the kitchen counter, then walks to the room where she once lived.

\---

Five years, and the room hasn't changed, save for the fine layer of dust that has settled over her possessions.

He begins with her closet, stuffing her blouses, her camisoles, her overcoats into the garbage bags. He spends twenty minutes messing with the lock on her jewelry drawer until Minhua takes pity on him, rolling the numbers to the correct combination when he's not looking. Clearly, he never listened whenever she told him that all her passwords were his birthdate. 

And then he comes across the family photo albums.

Minhua watches as he brushes a thumb across the faded book. On the front cover is a picture of the five of them - she and James standing in the back, while Timothy, Jonathan, and Kevin squat in front of them. And in that moment, Minhua decides she has to *do* something.

She floats back downstairs. Stares at Timothy's phone. And through sheer force of will, she manages to make a single call.

\---

"Timothy?"

Timothy startles, looking up from the photo album. He's been thumbing through the pictures for the past hour, lost in a time long past.

"Kevin? What are you doing here?"

"You called me," Kevin replied. "I figured it was probably a butt dial, but I called Rhonda and she told me you were going to clean up the house. Thought I'd stop by and help. Why didn't you ask us?" 

"Didn't want to bother you," Timothy mumbled in reply.

"It's not a bother at all," Kevin's eyes flick down to the photo album. "Looking at the good old days, huh? We should meet up more. More than once a year, at least."

Timothy stands up, setting the photo album aside. "Yeah, you're right. I'll call Jonathan, see if he has time. We can clean up the house together." 

\---

It's been six years and seven months. 

Minhua watches as the ties between her children slowly knit themselves back together. She watches as her grandchildren grow up with one another. On a warm summer's night in July, she sees the three of them at Timothy's house, laughing and joking with one another in a way that she hasn't seen since her death. And she decides that she can finally rest easy.
