I love the descriptions here, girlcake. Particularly this one:

>> His hand was like a bee sting on her arm as he pulled her into the warehouse’s murky alcove of discarded lamps and accessories. 

I also love how you’ve made the first part so relatable to anyone who has been in customer service. It worked really well. And then of course your brilliant ending:

>> Yes, we’ve seen you, Anne, and we need you.”

The only thing I’d say there is that it feels a bit like a cliffhanger. I want to know what happens next
