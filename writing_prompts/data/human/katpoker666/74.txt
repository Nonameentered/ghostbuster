Hey thirty5foxx! Don’t think I’ve bumped into your words before, but hope to hear more of them as this was an intense read! You have some great descriptions here. 

A couple small things:

Be careful with passive tense / feelings the character is having being passive. E.g.,

>>It prompted shivers of cold to crawl down my spine and trickle out like tendrils towards my frail hands. 

Vs.

Shivers of cold crawled down my spine and trickled out like tendrils towards my shaking hands. 

I did change the word ‘frail’ here.  The reason I’d suggest that is as a reader I wanted to know a little more about why the hands mattered in such a short piece.

Here, I think you could have saved some word count as your repeating the same thing for effect. While that’s certainly a valid tool, with limited word count you want to be as economical as possible with your word use:

>>Every step I took increased that ever-growing sense of hopelessness and caused further decline of any strength I had left. I grew weaker and weaker with every inch.

So maybe something like this:
With every step I grew weaker,  hopelessness sapping what little strength remained

Overall, a really strong piece
