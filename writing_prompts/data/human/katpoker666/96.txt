I enjoyed this, Valky. The tone was really spot on and I think you set up the premise well. Particularly in this line where it was really tight:

>>Would you rather us just choose for you?” she asked, a brow raised in challenge. 

I think though that the first paragraph could be tightened a bit to free up word count to describe more of why the guy is a jerk, as that feels like it could use more :

>> The party was in full swing, my stomach twisted up in knots with what was to come. My eyes scanned the distance for any notable faces. After a few moments, I realized I recognized no one, and that this was going to be worse than I thought. I strolled around the edges of the ballroom, trying to avoid any conversation. All was going well until my mother stepped in my path.

So maybe something like:

The party was in full swing. My stomach twisted into knots as I realized I recognized no one. Strolling around the ballroom’s perimeter, I tried to avoid conversation. All was going well until my mother stepped in my path.

Similarly, I think you could buy some word count by shortening your description of the guy. While vivid and quite elegant, the section uses up 94 words to describe him, which is a lot for such a short piece. So maybe we don’t need to know quite as much detail of what he looks like vs why he’s a jerk and she’s reacting so strongly to him:

>> A hand grips around my wrist and I jerk to a stop. I turn to face the perpetrator and find it’s a young man. His snow white hair dips low in the front, obscuring his eyes while short on the sides and back. His face is made up of sharp angles and high cheekbones, an upper lip fuller than the lower with blindingly white teeth for a smile. I let my eyes wander down taking in the rest of him. A lean body fills out his dark-colored vest and dress shirt with matching pants.

So maybe something like this, where you keep a lot of detail in, but also save room for the juicy why he’s a jerk bit:

A hand grasps my wrist and pulls me back. A young man with snow white hair stares back. His face is made up of sharp angles and high cheekbones. Thin lips encase blindingly white teeth. Dark clothes add to his wolffish appearance.

Not perfect, obviously, but hopefully conveys the idea. The big thing with descriptions in short pieces is making them count to move the narrative forward.

Hope this helps. And sorry for rattling on a bit—it’s a strong piece and just wanted to make a couple suggestions as to where it could be tighter
