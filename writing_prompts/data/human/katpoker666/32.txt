‘Crime and Pun-ishment’

—-

The fist flew into Jeremy’s face at such force a tooth wavered. “Why. Did. You make me fail my history test?” The bully growled.

“I didn’t *make* you fail. I *gave* you the answers. It’s not my fault you forgot them.”

Landing repeatedly, the bully’s fists pummeled the teen. “Not. Good. Enough. Jeremy.”

A skinny man in a dark grey hooded sweatshirt stepped out of the shadows. 

The young thug ran away.

Jeremy flinched back. Despite his slight frame, something was unnerving about the stranger. “Wh-who are you?”

“I’m the Pun-isher.”

“Wait, isn’t that a big muscly guy? Has a sort of skull-like thing on his chest…”

“Well, yes. There is *that* guy, but I’m the real deal.”

Jeremy felt braver as the smaller man fumbled. “Prove it.”

“Look, I’m conducting a criminal investigation.  Do you *want* to pay pun-itive damages?”

“For what?” Jeremy furrowed his brow. “Hold on. That was a pun. What did you say your name is?”

“The Pun-isher.”

“So, what is your power exactly? You are powered, right?”

“Umm…something like that. I make the guilty suffer for their evil ways.”

“Ah, cool. Think you could help me with my bully?”

“Perhaps. Is he a *pen* in your butt?”

“*She*. And was that a pun about where livestock stay? If so, it was a particularly corny one.”

“Sorry, don’t have a cow—force of habit.”

“There you go again. I’m gonna leave now. Clearly, you can’t help.” Jeremy turned on his heel.”

“Stop. Seriously, I can aid you with your issues. Don’t be de-part of the problem.” The Pun-usher rubbed his chin. “Give me a chance?”

Sighing, Jeremy nodded. “Nothing else has worked. So, why not?”

“No need to be-labor the point then. Where does she live?”

Jeremy groaned and face-palmed. He pointed to a building a few yards away. “My house. She’s my *younger* sister.”

Bursting out laughing, the Pun-isher shook his head. “Really? Your little sis did *that* to you? Talk about sibling rivalry!”

“Ok. This is ridiculous,” Jeremy sighed. “Would you just leave?”

“Not a chance. You need help, and I’m going to give it to you whether you like it or not. I’m overly qualified for this mission, in fact: pun-ctilious, pun-ctual, and can land a good pun-ch besides.”

“Wow. You suck less at puns than I thought. I will give you one more chance. But don’t hurt my sister, ok? It’s not cool when adults fight with kids.”

“Agreed. Small thing. My *power* is to pun people into submission, as you know. The part I left out is I can only make *good* puns about the word ‘pun.’ It’s still annoying as hell, but a little more limited.”

“Ok—“ Jeremy rolled his eyes. “That’s it. You know what? I’m going to deal with this myself and talk to her like a rational person.”

“Just don’t be a pun-k about it.”

Note: yes, I used the theme word, but I’m very bad at avoiding temptation where puns are concerned
