‘Ozzy and the Evil Kibble Machine’

—-

Golden eyes peered around the bubble-spouting treasure chest. Hot breath condensed against the tank outside in rivulets that dripped down his whiskers onto the accursed bandanna around his neck. The bell was bad enough, Ozzy thought. But a swatch of random fabric around his favorite chin scritching zone. *That* was unconscionable. 

He scratched at it and licked his paws in disdain. More urgent matters were at hand. This new dinner delivery system was impossible to get into. Sure he had put on a few pounds lately. But did the wonderful fishy-smelling kibble have to be inside a water-filled glass container with a roof on it? 

Margot was a joker. That had to be it. Knowing he hated water and was, all in all, lazy even for a cat, she must have enjoyed planning this. 

Ha. HA. HA!

Mreow. Back to the problem at hand, Ozzy mused, tummy rumbling.

He stuck his paw between the glass’ top edge and the metal roof. Prying the two apart with his claws, he gained a half-inch of access. 

A fish jumped and nibbled his pad as the roof clattered back down. Removing his paw in the nick of time, Ozzy concluded Margot’s game was less funny. 

Pacing in front of the aquarium, he mewed plaintively.

What to do…?

The bookshelf above the aquarium gave Ozzy an idea. He’d show Margot this new food delivery system was stupid. Why he’d break it, he would.

Hopping up on the shelf, he pushed at the books with all his might. 

The bandana caught between their spines, and Ozzy tumbled into the aquarium with them.

Soaked, Ozzy licked his paws before tucking into a fish.

At least Margot would learn her lesson.
