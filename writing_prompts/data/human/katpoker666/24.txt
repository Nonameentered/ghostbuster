‘Lacrosse, With Vampires’

—-

Etching a long thin crimson line down Max’s neck with her dagger-like nails, Elenora then traced the crimson mark with her tongue. “You’ve been drinking camomile, haven’t you, my angel?”

“Yes. You like that, don’t you, Mistress?“

“Indeed. It removes that funny little aftertaste you sometimes have.”

She dug her fangs deeper into Max’s neck. They whimpered with a mix of pain and pleasure, turning their neck to allow Elenora better access. Turning pale, they winced. 

Elenora tongued Max’s wound to staunch the bleeding. “I’m sorry, my sweet. I got carried away with the wonderful floral notes in your essence.”

“It’s ok, Mistress; we all go a little mad sometimes.”

“Your truths are worse than your lies, my beloved. Just because I’m famished is no excuse to get carried away. Are you alright?”

Max patted their neck. “I think so, Mistress.”

“I’m glad. Sometimes I get all jargogled around you—I love you so much.” Elenora tousled Max’s short raven locks with her fingers. “You love me too, don’t you?”

“O-of course, Mistress.”

“You sound afraid. Did I do something wrong?”

“No. Although—“

Elenora swiped an errant dribble of blood from her flawless skin, smearing it in the process. She reached out, cupping Max’s chin in her hand and leaning toward them.  “Although, what, my heart?”

Shuffling from foot to foot, Max sighed. “Please don’t take this the wrong way, but sometimes I wish I had more autonomy. You know, to do normal human stuff.”

“You want to leave me?” Elenora looked down, her eyes rimmed with tears.

Max reached over to her and hugged her tight. “Of course not, Mistress. I love you.” Biting her lip, Max continued. “It’s just our love is so all-consuming I lose sight of who *I* am sometimes. Does that make sense?”

“You mean, you want time to yourself?” Stroking her chin, Elenora had a faraway look. “My last partner asked the same before he left me—“

“I’m not Sam, Elenora. I’m Max. *Your* Max. I just want to go for the occasional walk through the hills and to play lacrosse sometimes.”

Staring at Max intently, her eyes widened at the word ‘lacrosse.’ “Interesting—I had no idea you played. When I first came to the New World, I watched the Native Americans play the original version of that. It was great fun.” Her eyes twinkled. “Would you mind if I came and watched sometimes?”

Max paused. “Does that mean you’ll let me do it?”

“*Let*, my dearest? All you’ve ever had to do is ask.”

Leaning forward, Max’s face was a mask of surprise. “Mistress, please don’t toy with me.”

“I’m not,” Elenora shrugged. “I swear it on my maker.”

“But why?”

“Because you asked. And because I may be a millennium old, my sweet, but I still remember what it is to be human.”
