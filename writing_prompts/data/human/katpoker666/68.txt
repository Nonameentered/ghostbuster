‘Blonder’

—-

On a neon pink comforter, two girls stared up at the ceiling, looking into the larger-than-life brown eyes of Johnny Depp.

“Like, oh my god. He’s *so* gorgeous. I would *totally* do him.”

“Not if I snag him first, Tiff.” Jess raised her arms to the ceiling and made slurpy-kissy sounds.

“You’re *so* bad.”

“I know, right?” She flicked back the side of her medium-brown, chin-length bob. “You know what we need? A makeover!”

“Totes,” Tiff said, popping a giant bubble of Hubba Bubba gnarly-apple gum. “I’ll grab the Cosmos.”

They pored over the magazines, underlining and dog-earring pages with the focus that others would apply to homework.

“OMG, Jess, you’d look *amazeballs* with this hair.” Holding up the page, Tiff pointed with the over-energetic enthusiasm of a puppy. “Look at the blonde—it’s like Mah-donna’s in *that* new video.

Jess squealed with glee. “Let’s *so* do it!”

“Totes! Let’s go get you blonde *and* tan by the pool.”

They wetted and sprayed Jess’ hair with liberal Sun-In.

“Is that enough, Tiff? Don’t want that weird orange color.” 

A half-bottle of fake-lemon-and-peroxide-scented goodness later, and the teens were ready. 

After three hours of skin turning that reddish-brown shade normally reserved for squirrels, they went to see the result. 

“It’s, umm, not orange…”

Jess grasped a clump of the now straw-like mass. “I. Am. Ruined. Why would *anyone* date a girl with hair the color of a highlighter?”

“Ok. It’s not *that* bad. My mom has some blonde Clairol dye next door. It should *like* totally work.”

“But that’s not *natural* like Sun-In,” Jess sighed.

“‘kay. Let’s see. Leave for 15-20 minutes. I’ll set the egg timer.”

“Do it for 30, Tiff—I want it *super* light.”

Raising a carefully tweezed eyebrow, Tiff did as she was told. “Like ok, next we put on this plastic shower cap and waIt.”

The timer rang, and sure enough, *something* was sunny side up. Jess’s hair had gone from highlighter yellow to pale golden blonde at the tips with an orange-ish center. “The blonde bits aren’t even platinum! This look Is *so* eight months ago. What do I do?”

Tiff hugged her bestie. “Look. It’s fragile right now,” she said, rubbing a brittle piece between her fingers. “I think you *need* to go to a salon.”

Ugly snotty tears poured down Jess’ cheeks. “My. Mom. Is. Going. To. Kill. Me.”

“Look, she’ll deal. There’s nothing else we can do.”

“Do you mind going home,” Jess moaned? “I want to be alone.”

The next morning, Jess let out a wail that could be heard at Tiff’s. “Bald! I’m freaking bald.”

Racing over, Tiff ran up to her friend’s room. Her jaw dropped.

On Jess’ pillow was a perfect white blonde halo of hair. 

“Oh my god, Jess, what did you use?”

“Clorox. You think I’m stupid, don’t you? Think it will come back?”

“In about a year,” Tiff murmured, hugging Jess.
