‘From Entebbe with Love’

—-

“Sometimes you need to scorch everything to the ground and start over,” Tim advised.

“It’s just crowded, is all. And what about the *ants*? What kind of *monster* are you?”

He held up a Sherlock Holmes-sized magnifying glass. “The kind who brings the right tools for the job, Lynn?” Leaning in, Tim pointed the lens at *my* ant farm. 

I slapped his hand as a tiny bead of light formed above Andy the ant’s head. The tool flung back in the air, narrowly missing the coffee table as it collided with the carpet.

“Be careful—that was Grandpa’s!”

“I *know* Tim. What I don’t know is why you’re trying to kill my ants.”

“There’s too many of them.” He looked up and grinned. “C’mon…it’ll be fun to kill a few. The others won’t even notice.”

“You are such a jerk. You know that?”

“Maybe, but I’m the only brother you have. So, get used to it.”

As the years passed, his levels of jerk-dom only climbed new heights or plumbed new lows, depending on your perspective. 

Dinner loomed each night for the three of us with the grace of a dragon crouching on eggshells. 

“Pass the salt shaker, please?”

“Don’t start eating yet, young man. You haven’t told us about your day yet.”

Tim leaned back in his chair and burped. “What’s to tell? I work at the same rust-bucket gas station every day. It’s a small town. Nothing happens.”

“Well, what about that girl you like? Kelly, was it?”

“Yeah…last week. I’ve moved on. Now it’s Janine with the full-body Smurf tattoo.”

“That sounds nice. What do you like about her?”

“I have an interest in the outsider,” Tim laughed and rolled his eyes. “Seriously, were you listening at all? A life-size Smurf tattoo didn’t set off any sarcasm alarms?”

My mother had the grace to blush before stammering on, “You did like them when you were a kid…”

“Mom? Can we just eat in silence, please?” I asked, pitying the underdog in this family dynamic.

She perked up at that like a dog seeing a marrow bone. “You haven’t told us about your day either, missy. What did you get up to, Lynn?”

“Nothing much. Another dissection in AP Bio—“

“Gross! Mom, we’re eating.”

“Tim. Let your sister share. It’s so rare either of you tells me anything these days.” She sighed. “Please keep it table-friendly, Lynn.”

“Sure. Mom. Well… I got into U Penn’s pre-veterinary program. I’m excited about that.”

“One of the best in the country. That’s great news. You should be proud, sweetie.”

“I am, but… there’s also this great immersion program with Jane Goodall in Entebbe, Uganda working with chimpanzees that I’m considering. I think I could do a lot of good.”

“Say, what now? You want to immigrate to Africa? Like, live there permanently?”

“Honestly, Tim, I’m amazed you knew Uganda was in Africa. But no. Not permanently. I may go back, but I need to train first.”

“Lynn Elizabeth Stevens, stop this nonsense this instant.” Mom’s face turned a lurid red light when she’d had too many glasses of merlot. “I thought we agreed that a good vet program in college and grad school would be perfect for you?”

“Maybe for you? I’m the one busting my butt to get scholarships and straight As.”

“Yeah, but it’s *your* dream to become a veterinarian.”

“Look. I can’t deal with this right now. I have an exam tomorrow,” I lied, standing up and heading to my room.

“We weren’t done yet.”

“Sorry,” I said, pulling my door shut. I wanted to slam it, scream, do something, but what would that solve? I’m stuck here until I graduate.

I pulled out my journal and began drawing a decision tree to try and figure out how to get my mom to agree to Uganda. Step one. List her objections. Money. Time lost. That I might stay there. That she’d miss me. The list went on. 

For each variable, I sketched out a series of branches until I reached a dead end or resolved the problem. The hardest ones, I would come back to.

My grandpa’s voice echoed in my head, “Every time you find something that doesn’t work, you’re a step closer to what does work.” 

God, I miss him. He was a man of science, logic. Not like…*them*.

Around 4 am, long past my bedtime, I found what I thought would be a workable solution. 

I yawned as I turned off the lamp and said goodnight to my very healthy, long-lived ant farm.

Remembering my stupid brother’s ant torture over the years, I realized people don’t really change. He’s still the same jerk. Mom’s still the same well-intentioned worry wart. And me? “Thank god for animals because I am haunted by humans.”
