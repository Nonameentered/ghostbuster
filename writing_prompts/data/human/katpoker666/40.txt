This is wonderful, geese! I love the way you’ve built out the rivalry to build up to the comic closing. The title works well too and I like the alliteration. And the sheer absurdity of the micro-focused departments is great fun. 

A couple small things:
- this may be a me thing, but I couldn’t tell whether they were journalists or cops. Either would work, I guess. Maybe a quick grounding statement upfront though? Since there isn’t much detail on my the physical setting, it would help me at least to mentally fill in where they are
- I was a little unclear who did investigate. I think if I new I’d understand the jurisdiction argument a little better:

>> "A thorny issue, to be sure, but the fact remains that you didn't investigate, and when the body was found, it was already dead by impalement.
