‘Arkansas Johns and the Temple of Jolie’

—-

What’s the point? I don’t want to go into *another* dank cave. But darn it, *Angie’s* there.  Why does she have to be *so* dang hot?

Her brunette braid hangs low, all the way to her lumbar. Those are some *serious* extensions. I can’t help but wonder how she keeps them so nice. It’s like my balding pate looks mussed after five minutes. *How*’ does she do it?

“Hey, Arkansas. Didn’t expect to see you here.”

“Hey. Yeah, umm….” Think Arkansas. ‘I followed you here cuz you’re beautiful’ sounds creep-tastic as fudge. “I was out for some tomb exploring and, uh, bumped into you. Fancy that.”

She laughs a soft tinkle that says, ‘I know I have a great laugh.’ And I fall for it, hook, line, and sinker. 

“Hey. Crazy idea, since we’re both here, want to explore together?”

“Umm. Well, I usually work alone, but…” Angie pauses so long I can feel every air molecule leaving my lungs. “But you know what? I’ve been meaning to stretch my boundaries a bit. And well, hanging out with you is *quite* a stretch…so let’s do it.”

She said yes! So, what if it was decidedly tepid? Now to turn on the charm.

“Come here often?”

Angie raises a perfectly arched brow. “No. First time. You?”

“Same,” I chuckle, my nerves getting the better of me. “So, umm, how about those stalagmites?” I point to the ceiling.

“Those are stalactites.”

“Yeah, umm... Just testing.  You passed with flying colors.”

“Mmm, whatever. Can you hand me your flashlight? I wanna see if there are any traps ahead.”

As I hand it to her, our fingers touch. An electric shiver runs up my spine. “Want me to come with you?”

Sighing, she shrugs her shoulders, casting an outsized silhouette along the cavern’s walls. “I guess.”

I point at the shadow. “Look, you’re taller than me now!”

“Okay…” Angie bites her lip, giving me butterflies. “We should be quiet. I read some of these traps here can be triggered by sound.”

“But shouting is so much fun with all of the cool echoes. Echo, echooo,” I bellow.

Out of nowhere, a huge boulder covered in spiders rolls towards us. 

Angie acts first, pushing me out of harm’s path. She must *really* like me! “Thanks, you saved me.”

Her top lip curls upward, revealing her gums. I never knew a lack of gingivitis could be so fetching. “It was nothing. You would have done the same for—.” She shakes her head. “You know what? Arkansas, *you* caused this with all of your noise. We *narrowly* escaped with our lives because of *you*.”

“Look, I’m sorry. Anyone can mess up.”

“Don’t you realize it’s life or death down here? Look, for both our sakes, why don’t you head back topside? No harm, no foul. I’ll meet you up there.”

“Meet me? Does this mean we are on a date?”

Angie’s jaw drops as she silently continues her descent.
