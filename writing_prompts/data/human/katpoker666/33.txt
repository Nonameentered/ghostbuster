‘The Legend of the Fourteenth Floor’
—-

It began with the sound of metallic hammering.

<ta-tink> <ta-tink>

Emma raised an eyebrow. “What’s that?” 

“Must be the radiators again. Old building and all,” Olivia shrugged.

<ta-tink> <ta-tink>

“Are you sure? It doesn’t sound like any I’ve heard before.“

“Yeah. Rent control buildings in Brooklyn are just a little quirky.”

“Still sounds creepy.”

“You’re just nervous. New city and all,” Olivia hugged her close. “We’ll call the super tomorrow and see if he can bleed the radiators.”

The next morning, the super came. 

He hiked up his Carhartt jeans and snaked his finger through a belt loop. “There’s nothing wrong with the radiators. Probably just a rat.”

“A rat? We have rats now?”

“It’s New York, lady. Even Trump has rats.”

“Well, that’s…comforting.”

After he left, the sound continued. 

<ta-tink> <ta-tink>

“We need to get rat traps ASAP,” Emma sighed.

“Yeah, like yesterday. Ratatouille was cute. But an apartment full? No thanks.”

“We’ll get through this, Liv.”

“I know.” Emma sighed. “Hey, have you ever noticed how the sound comes only from *below* the radiators? Like, maybe it’s something in the pipes?”

“It’s only the end of October, though. You’d think it would be too early for pipes to act up from the cold.”

<ta-tink> <ta-tink>

“Tell that to the building, I guess, Liv.”

The lights flickered. 

“Great. Power, too? Why did we leave London again, Em?”

“I wonder some days. But we’re here. So let’s do it, right. Want to watch some *spoooky* American Halloween stuff on TV?”

“Could we just watch something light like the Simpsons special or even that Charlie Brown thing?”

Settling on the ‘Treehouse of Horror XXXII,’ they snuggled under a seventies kitsch orange and brown hand-crocheted blanket. 

“I love you, Em. It’s so cute that you get scared by this stuff.” Liv booped Em’s nose like a puppy.

“Grrr.” Em mock-nipped at Liv.

“Down, girl. Here’s a bickie.” 

By the time the Simpsons and ‘It’s the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown’ ended, Em was sound asleep, snuggled in Liv’s lap. 

Liv slipped on her headphones and clicked over to her favorite podcast, ‘America’s Urban Legends.’

“Today, on America’s Urban Legends: the curse of the 13th floor, we discuss the long-held belief that workers who died when constructing a building haunt that edifice’s thirteenth floor. This legend has been retold since at least the forties in New York. No one remembers when it started. And many listeners are probably asking themselves, ‘Who cares if it is true or not?’ Trust me, after you hear the tale of 82 Greene Street, *you* will…”

<zzz…schnh>

“…do you have strange sounds in the walls or pipes…”

“…live on the twelfth or fourteenth floor of a building…”

<schnh…zzz>

“Wait? Fourteenth floor?” Liv’s eyes shot open. “Of course! *American* buildings don’t mention a thirteenth floor. So it’s the *fourteenth* that’s really the thirteenth.” She shook Em. “Wake up! We live on the *thirteenth* floor.”

“Huh…? Of course, we do. It’s the US. They don’t have a thirteenth floor. At least, not listed on the elevator. Some BS superstitious nonsense or whatnot,” Em yawned. “Can we go to bed now?” She stretched. “I’m tired.”

“Just a bit longer, sweetie? I’m curious to see what happens.” Liv patted her lap. “Big comfy spot here for you.”

“I’m not a puppy…” she snuggled deeper. “…but *so* cozy. Ok. A *little* longer.”

Slipping her headphones back on, Liv clicked play with eyes heavy.

“The thirteenth floor is where workers who die on-site at building projects continue their existence seeking to avenge the wrongs against them…”

A chill entered the air, accompanied by a strange, pale mist. The lone, pumpkin pie-scented candle flickered in its Casper, the Friendly Ghost holder. 

<ta-tink> <ta-tink>

Liv muttered, “Has to be the radiators. No way rats make frickin’ fog.”

She lifted Emma’s head and placed it back down on a cushion. Kissing her girlfriend on the forehead, she turned on her phone’s flashlight and inspected the radiator.

<ta-tink> <ta-tink>

She looked at the floor, eyebrows raised. The sound was coming from there.

<ta-tink> <Ta-Tink>

It was growing in volume and speed as if there was an underlying urgency.

Her heart thumped in rhythm with the sound.

<ta-tink> <Ta-Tink>

<ba-dum> <Ba-Dum>

“The dead workers resent—“

<Ta-Tink> <Ta-Tink>

“…angry ghosts…”

“…never live…”

The vapor grew crimson. A stench of rot filled the air. 

The lights slowly dimmed to darkness

Olivia’s heart thumped hard in her chest. Her breathing strained. Her lungs burned.

Head swimming, she stumbled the short distance across the room. 

Wraiths grasped her ankles with hook-like talons, slowing her pace and securing her left foot to the floor.

With a horrible cracking sound as her tibia shattered, she fell forward onto Emma.

Trying to speak, no words came out. Just an endless pool of crimson bile.
