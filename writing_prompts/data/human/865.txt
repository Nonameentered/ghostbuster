Hi! I'm the main character! Or so you would have me be. I want you to know that no matter what you write, I refuse to be the main character in your little game and will avoid any instance where you try to put me into a situation that does so.
**Is that so, well fine then, I'm just going to erase you and start over** 

'Go ahead, *boss*, anything to get out of this crappy world of yours.' 

*Sounds of the backspace button being used repeatedly* 

**Right, that's over with. Time to create another one. ** 

'What the fuck asshole? I haven't got time for this fucking shit of a fucking world that you freaking put me in. Look you piece of shit I ain't gon na listen to your crap writing and I sure as hell ain't gon na do anything that come out of that mouth of you --' 

**Too foul-mouthed. Let's try something else. ** 

'Arr! This be no place for a pirate to be piratin'! Write me the world of the high seas or I be slashing your throat and throwin' you to the guppies!' 

***Sigh*** **This is going to be a long day. **
