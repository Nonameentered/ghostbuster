You own a magical camera that is similar to a thermal camera, but instead of heat it shows you value. A ring glows as bright as the sun while a piece of plastic wrapping is almost invisible. You have been careful never to look at a person with it for your whole life.
The camera sat on the table, just waiting for use. 
Years had gone by, and temptation grew, thinking about what it knew. 
Objects, the only thing it had seen, how could that be? 
Seconds and minutes gave a goodbye, I needed to know what it thought of me. 

I took a step, a step closer indeed. 
I peered over, grabbing it with need. 
In front, was a mirror, my reflection beaming. 
What would it tell me? Unsure I seemed. 

Through the lens, I looked, 
How ugly I appeared, nothing like the words of a book. 
As invisible as I was, I understood. 
The camera I had used, was abused, not as it should.
