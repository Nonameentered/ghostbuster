Margaret whisked energetically where she sat in one corner of the busy kitchen, her eyes only on the custard. Her workspace was a riot of ramekins filled with freshly-made *Crème brûlée*, ready to roll out at a moment’s notice as soon as her mother gave the word.

All apart from two particular ramekins that still sat empty. These ones were of particularly pretty porcelain, gold filigree incorporated into the pure white material, twisting like growing vines. It took quite a bit of effort to not stare at the fine work and even more to not hide them away for safe-keeping.

Margaret shook herself out of her reverie and focused instead on the assembled, completed desserts, admiring the sparkling lids of caramel on each and every one. Smoothly melted with just a hint of darkening towards the middle, all of them satisfyingly hard to the touch. The one she’d sampled broke open with a delightful *click* to reveal the tasty custard beneath and the rest were sure to be just as nice.

Her mother called out over the kitchen in a harried voice. “Sweetie, how are the desserts coming?” 

“All done, mother!” Margaret chirped, as she poured the custard mixture into the beautiful ramekins. “Everything’s ready, except for the extra-pretty ones! Haven’t sugared and fired them yet!”

Annagret came over to confirm, peering critically at the fresh *Crème brûlée* as her daughter fidgeted. She picked the sample up and tasted it, then nodded, breathing a small, satisfied puff of smoke.

“Well done, sweetie! Service, please! Everything except the ones for the happy couple!”

Servers swept down on the desserts in a flurry of beautiful suits, whisking them all away with swift efficiency.

Margaret tilted her head as her mother undid her apron and quickly grabbed a new, clean one from the rack. 

“You as well, my treasure,” she said, nodding at a much smaller one that would fit her daughter. “It is time for the main event! Get a clean apron on, while I get these last two servings on a tray.”

Margaret did as told while Annagret set up a beautiful tray with the two ramekins on top, a bowl of raw sugar crystals to one side. She picked it up with one claw, balanced on her rear legs, and held her other foreleg out towards her daughter. 

“Come, sweetheart. This will be fun!”

“Okay, mother!”

She scrambled up her mother’s arm and settled comfortably on her shoulder, snuggled into Annagret’s neck as she started towards the kitchen’s exit. As she pushed the wide doors open and slipped out into the huge dining hall beyond, Margaret’s eyes went wide.

The hall was a riot of lights and colour, people of all possible shapes and sizes wearing their absolute finest sitting at the tables, all served with her desserts. The conversation hushed as Annagret walked regally through the throng, weaving skilfully through around the tables and chairs as she mad her way towards the high seat, where two people in truly *gorgeous* clothes were sitting together. 

Margaret couldn’t help but stare at the couple’s beautiful dresses, so white they were shining. One was detailed with silver, the other with purest gold, mirroring each other perfectly.

Her mother bowed as she came to a stop in front of the table. “My congratulations to the happy wives. I am Head Chef Annagret, and I hope you have been happy with your dinner thus far?”

The lady on the left smiled and nodded. “We have indeed! Everything has been delicious!”

“I am so glad to hear that,” Annagret said as she set her tray down and started to sprinkle the sugar crystals onto the waiting *Crème brûlée*. “And now, my daughter Margaret, who has made the dessert for you tonight, will put the finishing touches upon it.” She nudged her daughter with her cheek.

“Oh!” Margaret squeaked. “Oh yes!”

She scrambled down her mother’s outstretched arm and perched happily on her elbow. She straightened, took a deep breath, and exhaled a white-hot stream of flame over the *Crème brûlée*, carefully searing the sugar into a beautifully caramelised cap upon each.

“Oh wow, honey,” one of the brides murmured, “She’s so *cute!*”

Margaret chirped happily as she finished, puffing a final cloud of smoke to show off a little as she climbed back to her mother’s shoulder.

“Dragon-fired *Crème brûlée*,” she said, tail flicking and her wings spread wide, “The house speciality!”

*“Bon appétit!”*
