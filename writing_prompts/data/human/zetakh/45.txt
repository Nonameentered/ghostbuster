# Can't Have Crap in Detroit

“Come, my tenacious companions, we are nearly there!”

“You sure, Steve? Because this doesn’t really look promising, all I’m seeing is piles of scrapped cars and other junk.”

“Oh ye of little faith, Bob. The information is good, I assure you – the hoard is here, filled with precious stones of such untold numbers and beauty we and all of our descendants can retire.”

“What descendants?”

“Well I for one intend to beget an heir or two.”

“Not with me you aren’t!”

“I am well aware I’m not your type, Karen. Now hush, we’re close.”

“If you say so.”

“Watch your head, Karen.”

“Thanks, Steve. What are these things?”

“Look like stalactites. It's a bit weird in an old factory. Very colourful, though.”

“What did I *just* say about hushing– *whup!*”

“You okay, Steve?” 

“Ow. Well enough, I think, despite my involuntary pirouette. But you’d better get down here.”

“What is it? What have you found?”

“What we’re here for, obviously, Karen. Get yourself down here, you too Bob!”

“Holy shit. You were right.”

“I suppose you were right when you said some sacrifices must be made, whether ritual or otherwise to find this place, Steve.”

“Indeed. In this case, my dignity and previously unbruised buttocks.”

“Make sure to thank your ass for its service, Steve. Now let’s get to it!”

“Careful, Bob. Where there’s a hoard, there’s usually an owner.”

“Right. In, fill your bag, out. Don’t waste any time.”

“Very pretty, this stuff. Don’t think I’ve ever seen gems this colourful before! Look at all these layers!”

“You know your rocks, Steve, or you wouldn’t have come here. What are they?”

“Fordite!”

“Like the car?”

“Correct, Helen. It’s quite literally layers upon layers of old paint runoff from when they painted the newly-built cars in the factory. The colours kept layering on top of each other and eventually solidified into entire coverings of paints upon paints. Then when the factories were torn down or crumbled, people noticed the fancy paint rocks left behind and started collecting them. You can work and polish it into all sorts of things, just like most gemstones.”

“And people pay for this stuff?”

“Sure. It isn’t *that* easy to get legally and it’s pretty. A bit less morally reprehensible than buying shiny coal from De Beers, too.”

“I had that discussion with dad. He’d always thought the term *Blood Diamond* was a metaphor.”

“Nope, very real indeed.”

“Wow, check this one out!”

“Damn, that one’s bigger than my fist. Good find, Bob.”

“Yep, I might keep this one. Maybe make a fancy paperweight made out of genuine fordite, eh?”

*”I beg your pardon? That is top-grade Buick-Dodge-Chrysler-Caddillac-Fordium, with an inchoate marbling of rare Pontiac, you grabby-handed philistines!”*

“Gah!” 

“Bob!”

“Scurrying little thieves, in my hoard! I see the threat of automotive tetanus and trespassing tickets wasn’t enough! Foolish, foolish little humans!”

“Since when do dragons hoard paint chips!?”

“Do you have any idea how hard gold is to get a hold of these days? Do you expect us all to lay siege to Fort Knox? Besides, it’s soft and comfortable and I like the pretty colours. Though all that is besides the point! You have intruded upon the home and hoard of Ironfang Copperscale Chromewing Steelclaw Silverspine the Eighteenth! I judge you defilers and pillagers! The sentence is lunch!”

“No no no no no don’t eat me don’t eat me don’t–”

“Hey, hodge-podge junk-lizard! Catch these shades!”

“You dare, woman– *ow!*

“*Whoa!*”

“I’ve got you! Run, Bob!”

“My eye! When I, Ironfang Copperscale Chromewing Steelclaw Silverspine the Eighteenth get my claws on you I’ll squeeze you like a capri-sun for this!”

“Let’s not stick around for Miss Megalomania to make good on that threat!”

“Yep, going now.”

“She’s blocked the entrance!”

“There, through the assembly line!”

“You won’t get away, you skittering little mouthfuls! I, Ironfang Copperscale Chromewing Steelclaw Silverspine the Eighteenth, like my featherless bipeds cooked just as well as raw!

“Get down!”

“Ow ow ow, I think my ass is on fire–”

“Good, that’ll let you run faster!”

“There, that hole in the wall!”

“No!”

“Holy shi–”

“She just threw an engine block at us!”

“Less boggling, Bob, more running!”

“I’m through! Steve, hurry!”

“In, Bob!”

“I have you now, morsel! Ironfang Copperscale Chromewing Steelclaw Silverspine the Eighteenth feasts to– *how dare you escape while I’m monologuing!?*”

“This is Detroit, lady, not a Bond villain’s secret base! Ain’t nobody got time for that! Adios!”
