Cramped.

Cramped and oh so very *hungry.*

Hey lay curled tightly upon himself, the warm, curving walls that enclosed him on each side not letting him even stretch out a leg. He had a faint memory of being able to move a lot more freely, but he couldn't be sure. If he thought too hard on it, his memory grew strange and fuzzy.

He felt something bubble and growl in his stomach, startlingly loud. He was so very, *very* hungry. As if fuelled by his distress, he felt an overwhelming urge to *stretch.*

Bracing his head and shoulders against the wall, he pushed and kicked with his legs. His cramped muscles ached in protest, but still he didn't give up. He felt the wall shift. Digging his claws in, he redoubled his efforts. With as mighty a heave as he could manage, he *pushed.*

*Crack.*

So abruptly it startled him, the barrier gave way. He gasped and squinted as bright, warm light flooded in. He blinked, his vision clearing gradually as he lay panting, exhausted by the effort of freeing himself. After a moment, he kicked free from the remaining shards of his prison and crawled out into the warm brightness, looking around with interest.

He lay surrounded by green, a little patch of dusty ground in front of him. Above, a bright blue, vast expanse, seemingly endless. A bright light hung up there, so shiny he had to squint to look at it, the light gloriously warm upon his scales as he stretched to take all its warmth in.

Something sticky covered his hide, heavy upon his little wings as he unfurled them. With an irritated snort, he started cleaning himself, licking the stuff off his scales and wiping it from his tufted tail and mane with his claws.

At least it didn't taste bad. 

A shadow moved overhead, making him duck low and lay still, peering into the blue sky above. He didn't know what he was looking for, but every instinct told him to watch, and wait.

There! His gaze locked on the thing as it flew, seemingly fluttering aimlessly. He followed its progress as it set down upon a leaf for a few moments, then hopped aloft again to settle upon another, seemingly ignoring him.

His stomach growled.

Eyes fixed on his brightly-coloured prey, he crept closer. 

One step.

Two.

His tail wiggled.

Three.

He licked his lips.

His prey fluttered its wings.

He *leapt.*

The dazzling wings flashed as it tried to leap aloft, but he managed to snag his prey with a claw. He flapped his own wings wildly with triumph, landing in a heap with the desperately wiggling thing pinned against the sandy ground. Wasting no time, he bit down on its juicy abdomen.

And leapt away with dismay, as a *horrible* taste filled his mouth. He spat and hissed, coughing droplets of icky fluid as he shook his head from side to side.

Miserable, he crawled into the shelter of his broken prison, curling up with the bitter, *awful* taste still stuck on his tongue. He whimpered.

Then he heard a rustle.

He flattened himself against the ground again, forcing himself to stay still, despite his discomfort. The leaves on the far side of his clearing parted, revealing something *huge* walking towards him. 

It paused to sniff at the terrible thing he'd caught, before snorting with displeasure. It raised its head again, before looking over to his hiding place.

*And right at him.* 

His heart beat faster, eyes fixed on the massive thing as it regarded him. His muscles tensed, ready to send him dashing away from the threat in an instant.

But then it trilled, a clear, short little song that took all the anxiety out of him in an instant.

He recognised that sound.

He'd heard it so many times, stuck in his little prison. Felt the warmth, the closeness of the one singing it as they curled around him, shielding him from the cold.

That sound meant *Mom.*

He sat up, called back.

Mom approached, bent down to sniff at him.

He sniffed back.

This *smell* meant Mom.

She licked him, then, cleaning the last little sticky patches that he hadn't been able to reach himself. He trilled with pleasure and happiness, leaning into the loving ministrations.

Then his stomach growled again.

Mom snorted. With a gentle nudge, she herded him into shelter beneath some leaves, next to a smooth, round thing. Then she leapt into the air and away over the green.

He jumped as he heard a sudden shriek, tensing. Then Mom came back, landing in the middle of the little clearing with something held in her mouth.

She approached again and held it out towards him, dripping red and sweet-smelling.

He sniffed experimentally, licked at the sticky, warm liquid. Nibbled.

Then he tore into the offering, ripping free delicious gobbets of juicy meat. Mom huffed and settled down, curling up around him as he ate his first meal with relish.

Well. First *tasty* meal, at any rate.
