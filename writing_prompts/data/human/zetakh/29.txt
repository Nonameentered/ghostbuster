# The City

Richard didn’t recognise this part of the City.

That in and of itself wasn’t that unusual – the City was vast, far bigger than any one person could explore, and a lot of the newly built blocks all looked the same. Steel, glass and grey concrete slabs, the towering effigies to minimalist architectural design blending into each other.

What made him concerned was that he couldn’t remember how he’d got here.

His normal subway route had been diverted because of construction work, so he had been forced to get off at an unfamiliar station. There he’d been informed that the next train was late – electric failure – and there was no estimate for when a new one would arrive.

After five minutes of trying to relax on one of the tilted benches, designed with nothing but disregard for actual comfort, he’d opted to get a cab.

He’d gone up the stairs, sure that he’d be home only a little late, and then–

Then he was here. Standing in an abandoned street, no cars or people to be seen. The City’s steel titans looming above him, its myriad eyes peering at him through unblinking surveillance cameras.

Richard turned in a slow circle, looking up and down the empty, nameless street, then shook his head. He must have stumbled into a new, still cordoned-off block. Before the grand opening, the finishing touches yet to be put in before the new office buildings were put to use.

He took a deep, controlled breath, forcing himself to relax. Yes, that had to be it. He’d just need to walk a little further down the street, then he’d be back on one of the main intersections. Or he’d stumble over another subway station – this was the City! There were stations everywhere.

With a nod, Richard started walking again, the faint tickle of the cameras’ regard upon his neck as his shoes *clicked* against the clean pavement of the sidewalk.

“I know it’s to prevent crime,” he mumbled, peering up at one, “but do you really have to stare that much?”

The camera peered back, silently.

Then it blinked.

Richard’s heart lurched, a small stab of panic sending adrenaline rushing through his limbs as he stared at the camera.

It stared back, unmoving.

Richard didn’t move, even as his eyes started itching with the need to blink. He didn’t dare. He grimaced, the itch turning to pain as the camera looked at him, inert and quiet. Desperate, he started walking again, hoping against hope that–

The camera did not follow. It remained, fixed upon the spot where he had once been.

His heart pounding, Richard breathed a heavy sigh of relief and closed his eyes. He’d *never* been so happy to be disregarded. The itch upon his eyes abated and his pulse began to slow again, his panic fading. He blinked the last of the discomfort away, then picked up his pace.

He still felt *watched.*

He hurried along, his eyes downcast, not meeting the gazes of the cameras. He wasn’t sure how long he’d been walking before something finally broke the featureless monotony of the sidewalk.

It was, blessedly, a bench. One of those horrible slabs of concrete with armrests that made it impossible to lie down, and a backrest slanted just slightly *off*, so to lean on it for too long meant your back would hurt for a month – but it was still a *bench*, even though it tried its very best to stand in opposition to the original intent of letting a person rest.

Richard sighed, and sat down. He leaned back, ignoring the slight discomfort and the cameras that regarded his brief respite.

“Ow! Fuck!”

He leapt to his feet, clutching his leg, a red spot growing on his thigh. A sharp piece of glass poked out of the bench, its tip stained red with blood.

“What the fuck?” Richard gasped. He was sure that hadn’t been there when he sat down. Not trusting the bench, he limped to the nearest building and sat down on the sidewalk, back against the concrete wall.

As he sat there, pressing his hands into his wound, he felt something poke at him from below. He bent to see, and saw tiny metal nubs poking up from the concrete, sharp and uncomfortable.

*’Had they really been there before?’*

Something poked him in the back.

He looked up, seeing more nubs sticking out of the wall. Higher up, a camera watched him, its one eye glistening.

It blinked.

Richard stared, frozen with terror, as the City watched its injured prey. In the black reflection of the iris, he saw the street he sat on grow teeth.

Then the wall he leaned against slammed down upon him, grinding him into the hungry street.

I blame recently re-reading *The Sandman* for this one. Thank you for reading!
