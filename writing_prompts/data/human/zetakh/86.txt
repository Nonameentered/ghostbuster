# The Checkpoint

*Based on John Carpenter's The Thing*

The waiting was the worst part.

Standing at my post by the checkpoint, the incessant rain played a merry tune on my hazard hood. My suit creaked as I wiped the silvery drops from my visor in a vain attempt to clear my view.

*“Next!”*

As the next person to be tested stepped forward, my squad and I all raised our weapons, pointing the nozzles of our flamethrowers at the nervous woman who stepped under the leaky tarpaulin that covered the testing area. 

The medic, faceless behind his visor, withdrew a shiny new syringe and indicated the simple wooden stool next to him. “Take a seat, and roll up your sleeve.”

The woman sat down wordlessly and revealed her arm, the band-aid from yesterday still attached. Without comment, the medic tugged it loose and disinfected the reddish, irritated skin it covered. She grimaced as he slid the syringe in, drawing her blood with practised efficiency. 

As he withdrew and handed the woman a cotton wad to press against the wound, I tensed, finger on the trigger. Every fibre of my being wanted me to look as the medic did his test, but I forced myself to stare at the woman. She sat ramrod-straight, staring a hole in the back of the medic’s head as he carefully squeezed the syringe’s plunger and emptied the fresh blood into a plastic cup.

Then, with agonising slowness, he reached for his blowtorch.

I held my breath.

*Hiss.*

Just like that, as if by magic, relief washed over me. *Not this one either.*

The medic sagged with relief, turning to hand the pale woman a band-aid. “You’re free to go.” He waved towards the checkpoint exit. “Next!”

The woman hurried away without a word or second glance, and I turned my attention to the next person to enter.

Man, grey raincoat over a cheap suit. Nervous-looking and anxious. Like the hundreds behind him.

Same song and dance.

Syringe.

Blood.

Torch.

My glove creaked as my finger tensed on the trigger. My flamer coughed. With a curse, I punched the nozzle, willing the ignition flame not to go out.

*Hiss.*

The man deflated, his relief audible as he released a held breath.

I breathed out heavily, fogging my visor as I tried to get my racing heartbeat back under control.

*Not this one either.*

“Next!”

Woman again. Dark-skinned, kind of pretty. I double-checked my weapon as she sat, not wanting a repeat of the fiasco from just before. I saw the medic do his thing out of the corner of my eye as I tinkered with the nozzle and checked the fuel levels.

*Hiss.*

*“Gaaah!”*

I whipped my head in the medic’s direction.

The damn blood had leapt from the cup straight at the medic’s face plate. He clawed desperately at the writhing mass as it grew claws and pincers and tentacles and tried to rip its way into his flesh. 

Two of my squaddies turned their flamers on him.

I didn’t watch as they fired and his screams redoubled, mixed with the horrible shrieking of the cooking blood. I’d turned on The Thing sitting on the stool.

It got up, human form splitting open and falling apart as it was revealed. Whipping tentacles, eyes in all the wrong places, arm-long teeth and claws. It lunged for my squaddie opposite, the idiot gawping at the torched medic instead of watching the subject.

The Thing tore into him, his hazard suit crumpling like tissue paper as it tore him open. He screamed, then gurgled as he was ripped apart, eaten, *absorbed.* I dimly registered the crowd outside the testing area panicking, people screaming and pushing desperately to get away.

Then I turned my flamer on what was left of my unfortunate squaddie.

The Thing shrieked as it lit up, tentacles whipping wildly through the air. I held the trigger down, napalm pouring out onto the wailing mass until nothing remained but ash.

My weapon coughed, whined, went out. Empty.

With a final, futile pull of the trigger, I stepped back, breathing heavily. I reached down for the radio at my hip, to call in the incident to command, get some crowd control–

A twinge.

I looked down at my hand.

There. On my glove, right on top of my knuckles.

It was cut.

A cold chill of panic ran down my spine.

*The tentacles. I hadn’t noticed.*

Desperate, I reached for my handgun.

And stopped.

Something held my hand still, hovering at my hip.

Not letting me grab the gun.

Not letting me die.

An unbidden thought tickled my panicked mind as I strained and fought, knowing it was hopeless. 

*Time for another story.*

Now *I* was The Thing.

Hope I managed to do the film's tension a modicum of justice. 'tis one of my all-time favourite horrors :D
