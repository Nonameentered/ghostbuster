*Part Two of Two*

“Pitiful villagers, hearken to me!” A terrible voice rang out, followed by a thunderous sound of wings. “Your sacrifice has displeased me! She was a sinful, wicked soul, and your gifting her to me was an insult! Bring forth your leader’s get to be her replacement, or I shall burn you all to ash!”

The Elder trembled as he looked up at the dragon, a scrap of the witch’s dress still hanging from its teeth. It glared savagely at him, its nostrils glowing with fire.

“This is your doing, Father,” Linda said, her face an emotionless mask. She glared at him through red-rimmed eyes, her cheeks ruddy with tears. “First Falina, and now me. I hope you’re happy.”

Linda stepped past him as he fell to his knees, wailing.

The dragon stared at her as she approached, walking stiffly. Her heart thundered in her chest and her pulse roared in her veins, but she walked on, her gaze locked with the dragon’s own.

*At least I’ll be with Falina soon.*

She came to a stop within the dragon’s easy reach. “I am ready, beast. Claim me if you wish.”

“Oh I intend to, little morsel.” The dragon looked at her father. “I am mollified – but come near my territory again and I shan’t be so merciful!”

Then it turned to Linda again, licking its lips.

Linda closed her eyes as the dragon’s head snapped forward and snatched her up, the world going dark as the terrible jaws closed around her and tossed her into the dragon’s mouth.

She waited for the teeth to tear her to shreds, or for the dragon to throw its head back and swallow her whole–

But nothing happened. Her eyes blinked open as she peered through the gloom, dumbfounded, the dragon simply carrying her away.

A moment later the mouth opened again and she was spilled out onto soft grass and into warm afternoon sun, covered head-to-toe with spittle, yet unharmed.

“Linda!”

She leapt to her feet as she heard the voice, barely believing her ears. But then she saw her, Falina, running towards her with arms wide and a huge grin on her face.

“Falina!”

They slammed together, heedless of Linda’s soaked clothes, and held each other tight.

“But how!?” Linda gasped through her tears, “I thought you’d been eaten! The dragon–”

Falina chuckled. “I thought I was going to be, too! But Kamacite doesn’t care for humans, much to our good fortune!”

“Indeed,” the deep voice rumbled above them, “A brief taste was far more than enough. I beg your pardon for the rough treatment, Linda – I needed to make your sacrifice look convincing, so that they would finally leave me alone!”

Linda shuddered. “If you will forgive my saying so, great dragon, I believe the show was satisfactory. It was certainly the one and only dragon’s mouth I ever want to be inside of.”

Kamacite gave a rumbling, echoing laugh. “No offence taken, little morsel!”

“So what do we do now, Falina?”

“Anything we want, my love,” Falina answered. “But I suggest a bath and change of clothes, first and foremost!”

Kamacite laughed again. “You have a very sensible mate there, Linda. You’d best keep a good eye on her, or I might want her for myself!”

“Oh I know,” Linda said. “She’s *my* witch, and the best in all the land.”

“Very well. I wish you luck, little ones. You are always welcome to my cave for a spot of tea.”

With a nod, Kamacite leapt into the air and took to the sky.

Linda stared after her. “So dragons don’t like maidens, but they *do* like tea?”

“Life is full of surprises,” Falina laughed. “Not that we have any idea about the *maidens* bit…”

Linda blushed furiously, glaring at her girlfriend. “You wretch!”

Falina shrieked and dashed off, her enraged lover hot on her tail.

*Fin*
