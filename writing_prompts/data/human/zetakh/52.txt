# For Land and Sky, For Daughter and Son

Long ago, when the world was young, Dragon and Wyrm fought each other for the rule of Land and Sky. In that ethereal, nearly forgotten age, the law was Claw and Fire.

How long the war lasted none remember. But as more lives were lost, as feathers and scales littered the ground and the rivers ran red with blood, the leaders of both Dragons and Wyrms decided it had gone on for long enough. They sent envoys with gifts of the finest game, with fine words and precious stones. Under uneasy truce, they met.

Their meeting point was carefully chosen, far from any territory either considered of worth. A barren, red mountain known as the Iron Fang, in the middle of the Great Ocean. There, the Father of Dragons met the Mother of Wyrms, accompanied by their youngest-born. For though they disagreed on many things, they both held the well-being of their children as sacred above all else.

And they both knew that any contract they agreed to would never last, if it were not also kept in the hearts of their young.They set down upon the mountain’s plateau and bent to their arduous task of deciding the destinies of their peoples.

Their young, meanwhile, were left to their own devices and did as all restless children do. They played tag along the cliffs and in the sky. They stalked each other amongst the rocks. They hunted in the tidal pools, catching juicy fish within the chilly shallows of the ocean. With full bellies, they napped together upon the cliffs in the warm afternoon sun.

As the veil of night began to fall, they were awoken by chill winds and the cool spray of the tide. They shivered and hurried from the shore, back to the plateau. But, finding their parents in the midst of a vicious argument, they sought their own refuge from the cold. High up the mountain, they found a small cave. Still warmed by the sun and hidden from the winds, it was inviting shelter for Dragon and Wyrm alike. They hid themselves inside, coiled together in sleep.

The Father of Dragons and Mother of Wyrms fought long into the night. First with words. Then with snarls.

Until they finally came to blows.

They shook the mountain with their rage and broke the stone with their power. The seas boiled and roared, a veil of steam obscuring all the island. Rocks tumbled from the peak, rust stained their hides. They heard the very land wail with pain and terror.

Except, they realised, the screams were not of anguished land.

Their children were gone.

All disagreement forgotten, they followed the wails through the mist. Near the mountain’s peak, they found the cave. Within, they heard their childrens’ cry;

*”Help!”* cried the Dragon’s Daughter. *”We’re trapped!”*

*”The rocks!”* pleaded the Wyrm’s Son. *”It hurts!”*

The entrance was shattered, blocked by fallen rocks. The Father, strong and powerful, tore boulders away with his claws and flung them down the mountain. The Mother, lithe and brave, crawled inside upon her belly. She saw her Son, and the Dragon’s Daughter, pinned by rock-fall. She called out to them and swore she would save them.

But she could not reach them. Her great feathered wings, snowy-white and beautiful, trapped her in the opening. She shrieked with frustration and fear, but could go no further.

So she made her decision.

*”Clip my wings,”* she told Father. *”Tear my feathers and twist my bones, and I shall reach them.”*

*”Are you sure, Little Mother?”* Father asked. *”You will never fly again.”*

*”For the life of my Son, for the life of your daughter. No cost is too great. Though I shall never again feel the winds beneath my wings, I accept the sacrifice.”*

*”Then let it be so, Brave Mother.”*

Father tore Mother’s feathers from her wings. He cauterised the wounds with his flame, and wrenched the bones within their joints so that what remained lay clasped against her chest. Mother screamed and writhed, beneath Father’s fangs and flame, yet she endured.

Finally, it was done. With her hide scorched black by soot, her wings twisted and torn, once again she crawled inside the cavern.

And with those flightless, anguished wings, with the symbol of her sacrifice and love, she stole the children from destiny’s hungry jaws.

As she emerged, Father spread his great wings over her, to shield her and their children from the cold. By his flame, they slept.

To this day, the reminder of what they nearly lost remains.

That is why the Wyrm roams the plains and foothills, running free as master of the land.

That is why the Dragon nests within the mountains, soaring high as master of the sky.

And never again shall their kinship be forgotten.
