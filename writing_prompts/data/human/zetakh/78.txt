*Hiccup!*

Doctor Reynolds was flung off his feet as the scaly hide beneath his stethoscope expanded violently, Fafnir’s huge lungs inflating like balloons. He landed in a heap upon the turf of the open-air ER, the only place large enough to admit his house-sized patient.

Then he was knocked right over again as the ground shook beneath him, several tons of dragon falling back to the ground.

“I’m sorry!” Fafnir rumbled, turning his head to look. “Are you alright, Doctor?” He fluttered his wings anxiously as he settled – the sudden, violent inhalation of air had sent him several metres into the air.

“Yes, I’m fine,” Reynolds said, brushing his scrubs off. “Well, I see why you sought medical attention, Fafnir. Bouncing like that every time you hiccup has to make your work difficult.”

Fafnir sighed, his tail and wings drooping. “Yes, Doctor. I nearly lost an entire cargo-net full of packages when I went flying during loading–”

*Hiccup!*

Reynolds managed to keep standing as the tremor rolled along beneath his feet. 

“–but that isn’t nearly the worst of it!” Fafnir continued. “I've been thrown out of my cave!”

“What? Whyever for?”

*Hiccup!*

“Because both my husband and my wife say I’ll bring the cavern down upon our heads if I keep shaking the ground every time I hiccup! Or worse! They’re worried I’ll fall over onto the nest and crush the *eggs!”*

As Fafnir curled up in a despairing heap, head hidden beneath his wings and his talons digging into the soil, Reynolds thought his patient’s family might just have a reason to be concerned. He’d never seen hiccups so violent in *any* creature, let alone a full-grown dragon.

*Hiccup!*

“Very well, this is certainly a different case, but we’ll see what we can do.” Reynolds turned to Nurse Joy, who stood next to the doorway, holding onto the wall for balance. “Joy, get a dental brace, heavy-weight dragon specification, a Gastro support team, suits, and a high-voltage cattle prod. I don’t think normal folk remedies are going to cut it here.”

Joy shot him a strange look. “O-kay, Doc. Be right back!”

Fafnir blanched as he overheard, looking after Nurse Joy with alarm. “Cattle prod, Doctor? Dental gear?”

*Hiccup!* 

Reynolds didn’t even flinch this time, just waved dust away from his face. “I am sorry to say, Fafnir, that your case seems rather serious. And sadly rather dangerous, considering how large you are and the potential consequences for an accident as you bounce around like this.”

*Hiccup!*

“So I shall attempt a slightly drastic remedy by applying direct electric stimulation to your vagus nerve. As we don’t, however, have any appropriately sized stimulators… well…”

Nurse Joy returned, carrying the cattle prod and trailed by a full dozen people clad head-to-toe in thick yellow suits, zippered hoods hanging down their shoulders. They dragged carts loaded with even more suits, harnesses, and a large spool of steel wire attached to a crank. And atop it all lay a strange contraption looking like nothing less than a pair of toothless jaws, steely grey and padded with thick leather along the upper side.

Fafnir beheld the spectacle with wide eyes, curling tight upon himself. “How– how are you going to stimulate the nerve, Doctor?”

*Hiccup!* 

The crew yelled with dismay as the ground shook again, barely managing to steady the carts enough to not overturn completely.

“Orally, I am afraid,” Reynolds said. “I shall suit up. Nurse Joy, if you would prepare the patient.”

He began the laborious task of wrangling himself into a suit, the thick, fireproofed leather and kevlar stiff with recent washing. 

“Okay, Fafnir,” Joy said behind him, “If you would lie down on the ground and try to keep your head still, with your mouth open wide–”

*Hiccup!*

A yelp made Reynolds spin around to see Fafnir reared up, pawing at his throat and his eyes wide with panic. The team were staring at him with horrified fascination.

Joy was nowhere to be seen.

With a desperate cough, Fafnir slammed back to the ground and wheezed, spittle splattering onto the ground. A choked gurgle, then another cough, and poor Nurse Joy was spat out in a slime-covered heap beneath his mouth, coughing and vainly trying to wipe goo out of her face.

Reynolds stared as two of the Gastro team rushed forward and helped her stumble away, Fafnir looking at them with a look of abject terror and disgust.

“By the flame,” he said, ”I am so sorry! I didn’t mean– I just inhaled– She–”

“All’s well that ends well, Fafnir,” Reynolds said, feeling a little dazed. “Nurse Joy, are you alright?”

“I’m okay, Doc,” she spat, wiping herself with a towel. “But if you’ll excuse me, I think I need a new set of scrubs. And a shower.”

“Of course, Joy. As for the rest of us, I think we’ll have to be harnessed up and secured before we attempt to rig the braces up, to avoid similar incidents–”

*Hiccup!*

“–I for one only intend to be *swallowed*, not *inhaled.*"

It took nearly half an hour of near-misses and being flung about by the sudden gale-force winds before they were finally ready. Reynolds was hooked up to the large wire and the cable slowly let loose, overseen by the Gastro team. Fafnir’s mouth had been propped open with the metal jaws that were locked in place, making it impossible for him to bite down. 

“Very well, Fafnir, I shall begin. Try to remain still–”

*Hiccup!*

The cable jerked and went taught, stopping his violent plunge down Fafnir’s throat. He landed in a sprawl on the dragon’s forked tongue.

“Eech.” Fafnir murmured.

“Well I should hope so, Fafnir. I’m not a snack to be enjoyed, after all.” He turned to nod at the Gastro team manning the wire. “Let more out steadily as I go.”

He stepped further back into Fafnir’s mouth, cattle prod held tightly in his right hand and secured to his suit by a cord, his left on the dragon’s teeth for balance. His foot reached the very back of Fafnir’s tongue, the gullet looming open and dark in front of him. He reached up to turn on his headlight, then pawed his suit radio. 

“Comms check. Do you read me, Gastro? Over.”

“Rogers here, Doc. Loud and clear, you’re free to proceed. Over.”

*Hiccup!*

The convulsion tugged at him, but the cable held firm and taught behind him. Fafnir swallowed reflexively, his palate and tongue pushing against Reynold’s back.

“All is well,” he signalled. “I shall proceed, over.”

It was a tight passage. Within just a few moments Reynolds was soaked through with sweat as he fought for purchase, bent at the waist and struggling against the muscles that tugged and pushed at him. He could feel poor Fafnir convulse with every hiccup and cough every now and then.

“Distance check? Over.”

“Seven metres of cable, Doc.”

“Very good, this should do. Stand by.”

He looked around, studying the flesh around him. That bulge there ought to be the internal carotid, which meant that the vagus nerve would be…

Right there.

“Reynolds to Gastro, I’m on location. Inform the patient – this might sting a bit, over.”

“Understood, Doc, we’re ready. Over.”

Reynolds waited for a few beats of Fafnir’s heart, then plunged the cattle prod into the soft flesh of the throat.

And pulled the trigger.

The oesophagus convulsed around him, smoke drifting up from the tip of the sparking prod. He held the trigger for another heartbeat, then let go.

And waited.

Waited.

“Reynolds to Gastro, I count no more hiccups. Confirm? Over.”

“Gastro confirms, Doc. Patient has settled down and no further convulsions have been seen. Shall we start hauling you out? Over.”

“Go ahead, Gastro, and give my compliments to our patient. He stayed remarkably calm under the circumstances. Over.”

“He’s scratched a big lollipop in the ground, Doc. I think he’s a mite miffed with you. Over!”

“I suppose he can have an *actual* snack after all this. We’ll see what we can do.”
