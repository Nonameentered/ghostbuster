# An Unwise Sacrifice

I whined and struggled against my restraints, trying my best to chew through the uncomfortable muzzle that held my mouth shut. My cage rattled as my captor shook it, sending my snout banging painfully against the bars.

“Stop that!” he admonished. “After all the trouble I went through with catching you, you sparkly little bastard, I’m not letting you out of that cage!”

I glared at him and gave him an ineffectual middle claw, smoke rising from my nostrils as I snorted my affront.

He just scoffed with a show of teeth, before picking up his pace through the darkened corridors. “You really should be honoured, Zetakh. Only the very best of promising authors get picked for this singular honour. Why, the mere look inside our hallowed halls you’re seeing now is a privilege reserved for very few-”

I tuned out the rest of the rant as the sharp-dressed white fox that carried me to my impending doom went on and on about the architecture of the Mod Dungeons. I let my eyes wander, peering into the cells of other unfortunates as we went past.

Users banned for reposting the same Health Bar prompt a hundred times in as many hours. The Pit of Space Orcs. The Muted Choir, screaming their silent prompts for nobody to hear.

Finally, our trek stopped in front of an imposing door, inlaid with Reddit Gold and Platinum. The doorknobs were smiling Wholesome Awards, the damnable seals mocking me with their grins as my captor reached to push the portal open.

The chamber beyond was dark, my innate, muted glow revealing little but darkly stained cobblestones and rusted grates. The doors swung shut with a creak of tortured hinges as we stood in the middle of the darkness.

“Brother u/Cody_Fox23, you have returned,” someone spoke, deep within the gloom. “And who is this little morsel you have brought with you?”

Cody bowed with a flourish, before raising my cage high above his head.

“This is a fresh new writer of delectable quality! While he has barely written for the sub for a year, he has already showed grand promise!”

Another voice drifted in from the void. “He is small, barely a snack. Can he really feed a hunger such as ours?”

Cody nodded confidently. “He is small, but observe his healthy glow, his plump little stomach. He has grown fat with over thirty thousand karma and no less than *three* awards from the recent Best of 2021 awards!”

A third voice, this one pitched high with sudden alarm. “Wait. That isn’t Zetakh you have there, is it? The dragon-writing fellow?”

Cody blinked, momentarily nonplussed. “Why, yes, it is. An excellent candidate, as I’m sure you’d agree-”

“You *fool!* Have you forgotten who has laid claim to him!? Who’s emblem is on that purple ribbon he wears!? You put him back where you find him quickly, or so help me-”

A massive blow struck the doors behind us, shaking the entire chamber. Cody staggered and dropped my cage, sending me rolling over the pitted floor, tumbling end over end inside my cage.

As the cage came to a stop, another impact shook the doors in their frame. I heard a high-pitched shriek and the sound of splintering oak as something sharp and gleaming punched a hole through the wood.

*“Too late! She’s found us!”*

*“Out! Everybody out!”*

*“How!? That’s the only exit!”*

The doors buckled inward as a massive pincer ripped one in half. Another blow from what I now saw was a massive knife reduced the other one to splinters.

The hinges had finally had enough and what little remnants of the once beautifully crafted doors were left tumbled to the stone floor. A multitude of long, segmented legs clad in hard exoskeleton appeared as a monstrous, brightly coloured crab forced their way through the doorway and brandished their giant dagger in Cody’s direction.

The poor fox cringed backwards, scrambling away from the massive crustacean’s rage.

“Ah! u/OldBayJ!” he croaked, voice hoarse with terror. “Wait, this is all a-”

Bay interrupted by slamming her crushing pincer into the floor, pulverising cobblestones and sending my cage bouncing with the vibrations. She advanced towards him, knife brandished murderously.

“Where!”

*Slam.*

“Is!”

*Slam.*

“My!”

*Slam.*

“DRAGON!?”

Cody yelped and flattened himself to the floor, ears folded backward as he pointed at my cage with a shaking hand. “Over there! He’s perfectly safe, I assure you!”

One of Bay’s stalked eyes locked with mine and she sighed with relief. Still glaring ferociously at Cody, knife waving in the air, she walked over and scooped my cage up with her free pincer. She wasted no time to rip the cage open and slice through my bonds with a leg, depositing me safely on her shell between her eyes.

I held on as she circled the darkened room, glaring at the unseen people hiding in the gloom.

“Zetakh is *mine.* He bears my Crabulous Emblem and has a SerSun to finish! If you touch him again, Cody, I will turn your pelt into a Snoo Onesie!”

Cody yelped, making himself even smaller.

“Come along now, Zetakh. These ones will bother you no further!”

Bay turned and began to walk sideways out the door. I looked back into the dark room and snorted a puff of sparkly smoke as I adjusted the little purple bow around my neck.

I tapped Bay’s shell for attention, her eyes swivelling to look at me. “Thanks for the save, Bay! I thought I was a goner.”

“You’re welcome, Zee. Now to get you home - you have a SerSun chapter to write for me!”

I gave a cheeky salute. “Aye aye, ma’am!”

I leaned ENTIRELY on Discord Channel culture for this one! Special thanks to my two co-stars! <3
