I reached up to my pack and felt around. My axe was still there. I hooked it loose from its clasp and squeezed the handle, the warm wood comfortable in my hand. I gave Max a grim look.

She shook her head, her eyes pleading.

I nodded once, slowly, and pointed at the window.

Max’s eyes closed. I saw her deflate. Nod. She extended a fist.

I bumped it, and pushed myself to my feet. 

*What the hell am I doing?* I thought, as I began walking towards the beast.

As if something heard me, my boot bumped against something hard on the ground. I looked down. Partly obscured beneath the ashes, a shield. A freakin’ forgotten riot shield. Must’ve been blasted from the van.

I stooped, grabbed the handle, and pulled it free. It settled comfortably on my arm.

My strides lengthened.

I was out in the open now. The dragon would see me any moment, I was sure. But it was still focused on the building with the trapped people. Any second it might decide to set it ablaze, or tear the entire thing down. I needed to get its attention.

I gripped my axe tighter and slammed it against my shield, in time with my footsteps. The ringing sound of metal striking metal echoed out over the burning block, piercing the roar of the fire.

And that huge scaled head turned to look at me, blazing eyes narrowing.

“Come on, then,” I muttered, raising my shield, axe at my side. “Let’s see what you’ve got.”

The dragon took a step forward, then another. I saw it breathe in, its chest expanding. Then it opened its mouth and *roared.*

A fireball unlike any I’d ever seen came towards me. I ducked behind my shield as it came, certain I was about to turn to ash in an instant. I felt the pressure of the superheated air slam against me, pushing me back. The heat was so intense I staggered, for an absurd moment sure my feet had been burned away and dropped me onto the charred stumps that remained.

But then it was over.

I straightened, panting, my rebreather a familiar rhythm in my ears. My suit had held. My shield was half-melted, but still intact.

The dragon was still coming.

The street shook as it stalked towards me, its huge claws tearing through the ground. I didn’t have any illusions about what they would do to *me*. 

A talon raised.

The shadow fell on me.

Time seemed to slow as it came crashing down. I leapt to the side, barely avoiding being smeared into the ground as pebbles and dust bounced off my mask and shield. I spun, swinging my axe savagely into the flesh just above the wrist joint, tearing a large gash in the meat, black blood spraying.

The dragon shrieked with pain and rage. It spun, impossibly fast for something so large, and swung its tail down like a thousand-pound whip. I dodged desperately, shield up, and felt something hard impact the metal so hard it dented. My arm was wrenched painfully down by the blow, the rest of me dragged to my knees behind it. I didn’t have time for pain, though. The other massive claw raked at me, and I threw myself aside desperately to get away.

It caught my air tank. I screamed as I was flung bodily by my harness, tumbling painfully over the hot asphalt. I slid to a stop, gasping for air.

My rebreather line was cut. I tore my mask off and took a greedy gulp of the superheated air and smoke around me. My lungs burned with the heat and acrid sting of chemicals. Instantly, I was coughing.

But somehow, I still had my axe and shield.

The dragon came on again, snapping at me with its jaws. 

I dodged to the side and slammed my shield into its teeth. It hissed angrily at me and tried again, but it hadn’t gathered its momentum this time around. I met it head-on, lodging my shield between its jaws. The metal creaked and folded painfully on my arm, but held.

Then I swung my axe into the dragon’s eye.

It howled with agony, throwing its head back, insane with pain. I wasted no time, charging forward beneath it as it shrieked and writhed, pawing at its face.

I flung my ruined shield aside and grabbed my axe with both hands. Then I swung it, *hard*, up into the dragon’s belly. It parted the scales and flesh, black blood once again gushing out.

Then I set my shoulders, roared, and *tore.*

The dragon screamed as the stream of blood became a torrent. Once again I hacked at it. Twice, three times. I was covered head-to-toe in steaming black blood, the stuff so hot it was burning the skin of my face.

Then the dragon’s legs folded beneath it, its strength giving out. I threw myself aside as it collapsed, writhing feebly in the spreading pool of blood and viscera.

I dropped my axe and fell to my knees, coughing. All my strength gone with the fading adrenaline.

Around me, the fires raged on. My lungs ached with the heat of it. Every breath was a struggle, every moment agony.

But somewhere, in the distance, I heard a sound.

The shriek of sirens.

And the roar of engines.

I closed my eyes.

I was done.
