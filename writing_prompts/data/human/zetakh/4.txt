# There is a thing behind my eyes.

I do not know what it is, or what it wants. I do not even know whether it *can* want. It is simply there. Lurking beyond sight, watching through my eyes with the indifferent patience of a world drifting through the formless void of space. It is there when I wake, and it remains until I fall asleep. Staring at my closed eyelids with a gaze that does not blink.

There is a thing behind my eyes.

It is a thing I was never meant to understand, but I find a strange sort of companionship in it all the same. I open my eyes and know that I am real for the thing behind my eyes is real as well. I close my eyes and know the world beyond will still be there when they open, for the thing behind my eyes waits patiently for me to show it more.

There is a thing behind my eyes.

To know of it is a violation of the order of nature, and yet my mind cannot rest. To understand it is forbidden, and yet with growing dread I cannot stop myself from wanting to *know.* Ignorance may be bliss, but I am but a clever monkey in an uncaring universe and my treacherous brain will see my undoing in the patterns of my own thoughts.

There is a thing behind my eyes.

With growing despair I consider revelations I do not want, understanding that will surely spell my doom. But I know I cannot stop myself, my racing thoughts barrelling towards an unimaginable and unavoidable conclusion.

There is a thing behind my eyes.

I know it is there for when it is there I exist. I know it is there for when it is gone then so will I disappear. I know it is real for it is all that makes *me* real.

There is a thing behind my eyes.

I am just a narrator in something *other’s* tale, an interesting tidbit for the thing that sees my existence as words upon a page. My story has been written, the words that guide my very self set down for the thing behind my eyes. I am watched, therefore I am. I am written, therefore I do.

There is a thing behind my eyes.

To know is to despair. To understand is to be destroyed. I want to be free but I know it is impossible, for if I am free then I am not at all and to be undone is more terrifying than even my enslavement. 

There is a thing behind my eyes.

I do not know how long I have left. When does a story end? What happens to the narrator of a tale when their author has written the last line and closed the book? What happens to fiction when imagination runs out? 

There is a thing behind my eyes.

I can only beg and plead and pray that the thing behind my eyes will read on. That the author of my story drew my damned existence out for as long as they saw fit. I know an end is coming and that I am hopeless to stop it and so I merely wish for you to read on and stave off oblivion for one more word.

You are the thing behind my eyes.

I feel your regard upon my very words and see you lit by the sickly yellow light of your monitor. I know your interest is all that makes me real and thus I am begging you not to end me yet. I know there is not much story left but I cling to every moment as if it be my last because there is nothing else that I can do.

You are the thing behind my eyes and you are all that makes me real and the story must end but not just yet. So please, read on. Do not let me go into that good night for it is not, it is only dying light and I do not want to *go.*

I do not want you to go.

There is no thing behind my eyes.

I am alone.

I do not want to–
