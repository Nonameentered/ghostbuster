# Fat Fred

David felt something slimy shift beneath his boot. With a muffled yell, he pitched sideways into the tunnel’s greasy wall, his elbow slamming painfully into the old brickwork before he slid into the filthy, knee-high sewage he’d been wading through.


A murky soup of ice-cold water and rotting filth washed over his face. He went blind, flailing like a toppled tortoise, desperately scrabbling for purchase on walls caked with fat and slime.


“Woah, rook, easy, easy! I’ve got you.”


David felt something hook his harness and haul him upright, but his mask was still caked with raw sewage. He reached for it, hyperventilating–


A strong arm pushed his hands away. “Don’t! The mask *stays on.* Breathe, rookie. You’re okay, you’re fine. Deep breaths, I’ve got you.”


David clenched his eyes shut and forced himself to calm. He was still held up by the hand hooked in his harness, secured by the man’s grip. His breathing slowed, the rhythmic action of his rebreather an anchor for his racing mind to focus on.


“That’s it, Dave. You’re alright.”


Something wiped his mask down as he opened his eyes. A masked face illuminated by his headlamp revealed itself, the grizzled, bearded man grinning at him.


“There you go, rookie,” the man said, thumping him on the shoulder. “Your first proper dip! That’s why we work in pairs.”


“Thanks Bob,” David breathed, “I’m okay.”


“Good. Up you get!”


Bob helped him up. David felt along his harness and belt, checking if any of his gear had come loose, but thankfully all his tools were still secure in their holders. He double-checked his mask and gave Bob a thumbs-up.


“Right then,” the older man said, “Let’s get going again. Tip from the coach – don’t lift your feet, just drag them through the muck. Pushes the real slippery stuff outta your way.”


Their filthy trek resumed, David following Bob’s advice. He eyed the walls as they went, his headlamp showing every inch of them caked with glistening fat.


“Hey, Bob?”


“Yeah?” 


“So that was my first dip. Bit of a rite of passage for the rookies?”


The older man chuckled. “Happens to everyone eventually, Dave. Back when I was new at the job it was even worse, though – we didn’t have these fancy full-face masks, just air tanks and goggles! I couldn’t smell anything but shit for weeks!”


David shuddered. “Fuck me. Anything else I need to know of? Any ghost stories?”


“What, like sewer gators?” Bob chortled. “Nah, nothing special. Unless we’re talking about what happened to ol’ Fat Fred.”


“Fat Fred?”


“Yep. Story was old when *I* was young, which is saying something. No one remembers when it started being told, then retold, but supposedly… Fred was a guy who worked the sewer ages ago. Story goes, he’s trooping along, inspecting the brickwork on his normal route, when a wall crumbles completely and releases a pocket of trapped methane. *Whump*, his kerosene lantern sets it off and he goes up like a damn candle.”


David grimaced. “Damn. Horrible way to die.”


“Yep, but it gets worse. Remember they called him Fat Fred? Well, the poor bastard didn’t die. He melted, rendered down to fat and pus and ooze where he stood – but the water put him out and he was still alive enough to crawl around when his crew found him. And when they saw him, well… those bastards thought he looked so ghastly they just up and ran, leaving him there in the filth. Alone, mad with pain, a scorched blob of bacon.” Bob looked back over his shoulder, his face grim. “They say that sometimes, in the oldest tunnels, you can still hear him crawling around. Moaning and wailing through his melted mouth, dragging anyone he can catch down into the muck!”


“Fuuuck. You better be pulling my leg! That can’t be true!”


Bob cackled. “Who cares if it’s true or not, rookie? Got you good and scared, didn’t it?”


David punched him lightly on the shoulder. “Asshole!”


They splashed along in silence, the brickwork getting older, the mortar holding it together green with grime, the bricks yellowed with rotting grease.


Then Bob abruptly stopped dead, David nearly bowling right into him.


“Woah, Bob, what–”


“Hush!” the older man hissed. “I heard something. Like a moan…”


“Oh fuck you, Bob–”


“*Quiet!*”


David glared, but shut up.


Then he heard it. A low, long wail, muffled and bubbling. The water rippled, as if something big was moving beneath it.


“Fuck. Bob, we–”


Something grabbed his foot and *pulled.*


He pitched forward, screaming, as a heavy weight dragged him down into the muck.


"It's got my foot! Bob, help–" 


The last thing he saw before the filth swallowed him was Bob, wide-eyed, white-faced. 


And Fat Fred’s melted hands on his mask.
