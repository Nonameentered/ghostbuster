Prince Arjen rubbed his temples. “*Diplomacy,* brother? Really?”

Bjorn, the younger prince, was standing at attention beneath the throne’s dais, his gaze fixed at a point right above his brother’s forehead. A classic tactic both of them had gotten very good at during their military training – making eye contact with your instructor had been an excellent way to get volunteered for the next demonstration of sword-play.

That had never ended well for the volunteer.

Bjorn saluted. “Indeed, Prince-Regent. I engaged the dragon and came to a mutually beneficial agreement peacefully.”

“I’ll bet you did.” Arjen gave the gaggle of courtiers and nobles in the room a gimlet look, before waving at the nearest guard. “Please, leave us. We shall discuss the details in private.”

A few in the assembled crowd looked disappointed, but at the guards’ gentle prodding they filed out in fairly short order. All that remained were a handful of guards who discreetly faded into the background as they retook their positions in the corners of the throne room and carefully ignored everything the princes said.

As the doors shut behind the last few stragglers, Arjen leaned forward and glared at his brother. “Right, out with it. We both know what *diplomacy* with a dragon usually implies. Are the kingdom’s coffers empty now, just because you didn’t want to wet your sword?”

Bjorn shifted slightly, still not meeting his brother’s eyes. “Prince-Regent, both my sword and the kingdom’s coffers are in the same condition they were when I left, I assure you.” 

“Indeed? So you have no sordid details to divulge to me about how exactly you subdued a young and by all accounts *playful* dragon?”

“I have no sordid details to give because nothing sordid occurred, Prince-Regent. I merely came to a mutually beneficial agreement that would ensure peace and prosperity for all parties involved.

“Oh for– look me in the damn eyes, brother, we’re *alone!*” 

Bjorn flinched and complied, his expression flat as his brother’s gaze bored into him. A single bead of sweat rolled down his forehead as he stood there, once again rigid.

Arjen sighed. “Look. I’m not an idiot, Bjorn. I know deals with dragons don’t just *happen.* And, since gold was apparently not involved, there are very few other conclusions I can draw besides the one we *both* know I’m thinking of. So, out with it! If a dragon is going to show up at our father’s doorstep in a year with your scaly heir in tow, I want to know about it!”

The younger prince grimaced, then took a deep breath. “Very well, brother. First of all, you have no need to worry about any illegitimate offspring of mine showing up at the door – scaled or otherwise. Nothing of the sort happened.”

Arjen grunted, his eyes narrow. “Fine. Continue.”

Bjorn nodded. “Second, I might have stretched the truth *slightly* when I mentioned the kingdom’s coffers were still intact – they are, but I *did* have to requisition a few animals from a nearby farm. I needed something to offer to prove my peaceful intentions.”

The elder brother waved a hand. “Very well. We can spare a few gold for that. Go on.”

“Third–” Bjorn hesitated, clearing his throat. "*Third*, the agreement I came to with Pearl – that’s the dragon’s name–”

*”Bjooorn! Where are you, my shining knight? I am ready for our ceremony!”*

A shadow passed outside the window, shouts of alarm and shock erupting in its wake.

“Oh damnation!” Bjorn ran to the nearest window and threw it open. “Hold, guard! She means no harm! Let her land!”

With an excited trill and the *whoosh* of beating wings, an iridescent, cream-coloured reptilian head appeared in the window, nearly knocking Bjorn over. “My knight! There you are!”

The younger prince waved frantically at the white-faced guards, shooing them away. “Yes, yes dear, I’m here! You’re a might *early*, I hadn’t quite had time to tell anyone you were coming!”

“Oh, I could not wait! Our dinner was oh so pleasant!” She licked his face. “I needed to see you again, my knight!”

Bjorn sputtered and vainly tried to fend her off. “Ehe, I missed you too, dear!” 

*“Did you now, brother?”*

Prince and dragon froze, turning to face the throne together. Arjen was staring at them, an unreadable expression upon his face.

“Brother,” he said, “I do not believe you have introduced our guest?”

Bjorn smiled sheepishly, one hand on his neck and the other on Pearl’s muzzle. “Well, brother, I did say I had *engaged* the dragon! So without further ado – Prince-Regent Arjen, meet Pearl! Your soon-to-be sister-in-law!”
