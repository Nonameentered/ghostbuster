I’ve barely sat my *Dragonbucks* mug down on my desk when my phone rings, the ancient bakelite landline making a noise like a school’s fire alarm.

*Not the sort of noise I need at 7 am.*

I steal a quick sip, say a few well-placed curses, and pick up on the second ring. “Fish and Wildlife, DDA office. You’re speaking to Victor, how can I help you?”

The voice that answers has a distinctive twang to it best accompanied by banjo music. “Morning, Mr. Victor! So very sorry to call you so early, but I’ve got a bit of an issue this morning.”

“No trouble at all,” I lie. “To whom do I have the pleasure of speaking, and what is this issue you’re referring to?”

“This is Martha McDougal, I’ve got a little farm ‘bout twenty miles south of town? See, my issue is that when I went to bed last night I had five cows and one bull sleeping in my barn. This morning when I get up to go’s and milk the cows, I find that I’ve got *no* cows, *no* bull, and one very fat wing-ed lizard sleeping in my barn. You follow me, sugar?”

“You’ve got a dragon in your barn, ma’am?”

“That is indeed what I am telling you, sugar. Now what are y’all going to do about it?”

“Well, first things first, I’ll have to do an assessment at your farm, see what sort of dragon we’re dealing with. Then we’ll take it from there. Leave the dragon alone in the meantime, they’re likely to be sleeping off their gluttony but better safe than toasted. May I have your exact address?”

Five minutes later I’m in my car, rumbling down a narrow dirt road with nothing but fields on either side. It takes me a little less than half an hour to get to Martha’s ranch – wrecking the suspension wouldn’t come out of the department’s budget, if you catch my drift.

I roll up to the farmhouse and can pretty much immediately confirm Martha’s report. The barn isn’t far off, surrounded by dozens of yards of scorched grass and more than a few blackened bones.

Martha herself is waiting for me on the porch, sitting in a sunchair with a sweating glass of iced tea in her hand. She waves cheerfully as I approach. “That you, Victor? Come on up, make yourself comfortable!” She nods at a small table that holds another glass and a nearly full jug of more tea.

“Thank you Martha, very kind.” I pour myself a glass and take a sip, the liquid cold and pleasantly sweet. “Any changes while I was on my way here?”

“Nope, been calm as anything. I reckon beastie is sleeping, like you said on the phone. Not that I blame it after a meal like that!”

I wince. “Yes, quite. I’m sorry about your cows.”

She sighs. “Yep, poor Betsy and the others. Though I suppose they would’ve ended up on someone’s grill eventually, the dragon just beat me to the punch!”

I don’t really know what to say to that, so I nod and have another mouthful of tea, then set my now empty glass down. “Welp, I should go have a look at our guest while they’re still asleep – makes things easier.”

“Sure thing, sug. You want me to come with?”

I shake my head. “As long as the barn’s not locked, I don’t think that’ll be necessary.”

“It ain’t, you can go right in. You be careful now!”

“You too, ma’am. I’d advise getting inside if you hear a commotion.”

Then I turn and head towards the barn.

As I approach, the smell of dragon becomes very obvious, a distinct musk of smoke, charcoal, and sulphur. The scorched grass crunches under my feet as I approach the main doors, one standing slightly ajar. I pause just outside the opening to listen.

Rhythmic, heavy breaths, accompanied by a gentle, hot breeze, in and out. Like a house-sized bellows, pumping air at an even, calm pace. No snuffling, scratching, or hissing. Everything points to whatever is in there being sound asleep, dead to the world. I peer through the opening, then slip inside.

Half the roof is gone, a jagged hole letting the sunlight in, giving me a clear view of the new occupant. Clearly the dragon had dropped in from above and gone straight for the prize, eating the unfortunate cows before they could even realise they were on the menu.

She – because she’s clearly a female, judging by her size and particularly spiny tail, is lying on her side, wings spread straight behind her and her four legs sprawling. Her stomach is grotesquely swollen, the skin so taught that the thick, wide scutes have spread wide enough to show the dark hide beneath. She’s so fat I doubt she’d be able to fly for several days.

“Damn, girl,” I murmur, stepping closer to examine her properly. “You just couldn’t help yourself, could you?”

She doesn’t even react as I pull my phone out and snap a few photos. Head, dorsal side, the incredibly bloated stomach. I’ve just about finished when I spot a little tag on her neck, just behind her horns.

“Hello, what have we here? Do I know you, girl?”

She grumbles sleepily.

I climb up and have a proper look. Sure enough, a DDA, marked with a year, an ID number, and a QR code. I scan the code quickly, and look her up in the registry. Pretty young, only recently left her mother’s territory… I frown, a suspicion gnawing at me, then hit the contact for the regional office.

It rings three times before someone picks up. “Regional office, DDA.”

“Hey, this is Ranger Victor, badge number 552, personal PIN 1022. I’ve got a tagged beastie here that’s set up shop in someone’s barn, could do with some history to determine whether a relocation is possible.”

“Sure thing, 552. What’s the tag number?”

There’s the clatter of a keyboard as they punch my info into the system, then the unmistakable chug of a hard drive the government hasn’t seen fit to replace for the past fifteen years. “Ah, there we go. Let’s see here… yep, young female out of Idaho, last seen on her first mating flight.”

I get a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. “Mating flight?”

“Yep. Caught the eye of a fair few young males from the latest report, but no confirmed mating as of yet.”

“Hold for a second, will you?”

I mute the phone and hop down, then tip-toe past the dragon’s sprawled legs to her swollen abdomen. I follow the curve of her bloated stomach towards her hindquarters, then gently touch the taught skin between her scutes, pushing my hands in to feel.

Hard resistance meets me nearly instantly, confirming my suspicions. What I’d taken to be beef stew was, in fact, an omelette.

I grab the phone again. “Yo, I’m back. Update request on our young lady’s records, please.”

“Gotcha. What have we got?”

“I can confirm that she’s got a clutch a-cooking. I missed it at first because she ate six heads of cattle last night and is swollen like a damn balloon, but I could feel the eggs. She’s likely not going anywhere any time soon.”

“Damn, the ranchers around there aren’t gonna like that.”

“Nope, they’re not. Especially not Martha, who’s barn she took over for her nest. Not a talk I’m looking forward to. I’ll file a full report at the local office as soon as I’m back and send in a request for territory management and observation.”

“Aight, I’ll send these preliminary findings up the chain. Enjoy your rancher wrangling!”

*Click.*

I sigh and give momma dragon a pat. “Well, girl, you just landed me in a heap of trouble. You don’t mind if I shack up here with you if Martha goes all *Deliverance* on me, right?

*Snort.*

“Thanks.”

I hop back outside and up to the porch. 

Martha is right where I left her. “Well, sugar?”

“I’ve got good news and bad news, ma’am.”

Her eyes narrow. “Good news first.”

“Well, your dragon is gonna make the headlines, just like the old days when they first started showing up. She’s a beauty, and will likely draw a lot of tourists in a few months.”

Martha claps her hands together. “Oh, that is just dee-lightful to hear, sugar! Wait til’ the ladies at the book club hear about this!”

I nod, keeping my poker face on.

“Right, what’s the bad news?”

*Here we go.* “The bad news, Martha, is that she’s gonna be popular because she’s just about ready to lay a clutch and raise a gaggle of hatchlings… and, under the Dragon Conservation Act, any interference with a nesting female is a federal crime.”

I take a deep breath and lean forward. “Martha, I’m gonna have to buy your farm off’f you.”

Thirty seconds later I’m back in the barn, taking cover beneath momma dragon’s bloated belly. I can hear Martha screaming at some poor bastard at the office, her country twang more like the twang of a suddenly taught noose.

Run for the car and risk getting shot by an angry rancher, or hope a sleeping, pregnant dragon is full enough to not consider me a snack when she wakes up. Choices, choices.

Just another day at the DDA.
