When I write from the point of view of creatures that aren't human, I try to emphasise what makes them different from the more common human narrators we are more used to. Their size, their different senses, motivations. A snake might flick their tongue to taste the air, and huddle close to the ground to feel the vibrations of something approaching. A dragon might stretch their wings to appear intimidating, hunch down to look a person in the eye while they converse, show their teeth to make a threat. A bull will stomp the ground and snort if you look at them funny, then throw you fifteen feet in the air and kick you for good measurte. Little notes like that to describe their actions and mannerisms gives you that little extra spice that really shows that this is a different creature alltogether from what we can usually relate to.

Speaking of the more fantastical critters, I find it helpful to relate some of their behaviour to animals we already know. If you've thought up an alien or mythological being that's a predator, then looking to the hunting strategies and behaviours of wolves, big cats, and other predators is immensely helpful! Are they solitary? Do they form packs? Do they protect their young? If yes, how? How would they react to someone accidentally stumbles upon their nest? Predators are often patient and catious, potentially waiting for hours for the right time to go for their kill. Prey animals, on the other hand, are *skittish* and always on the alert, so your human character just walking up to a Martian Zebra would either find themselves standing in a cloud of dust, or trampled to death!

As a very well-known example of what I mean, have a look at Toothless from How To Train Your Dragon; he's mostly modeled on cats for how he moves and acts around Hiccup, and that is reflected in every motion he makes. He crouches low to the ground when he's stalking, kneads the ground and spins in circles before he settles down to rest. His more fantastical abilities and reptilian features are just layered on top of the software of a common pet a lot of us can at least *somewhat* relate to!

Finally, try not to get too bogged down in descriptions of the creature *itself.* Focus on what makes it special - if another character is observing it, focus on what that character notices. Does it have distinctive markings, huge claws, fangs? Has it noticed our character? How has it reacted? And from the other viewpoint, focus on the little things the creature itself would notice as it acts. Very rarely do we describe ourselves, but we might think about our sensations, which ties back to the senses mentioned up above. Smells, sounds, the feel of the ground beneath your creature's feet/paws/pseudopods. And don't be afraid to go a bit out there - Xenofiction is fun, and *you* should have fun with it too!
