*Part One*

It was another sleepy, wonderful day above Deepheart Forest for Darryl as he lazily drifted through the calm thermals of his territory. Far in the distance he could see the pale smoke of the village, the little community waking their cooking fires and smithies from the night’s slumber.


He absently checked his harness, making sure his load still rested safely strapped against his sides and belly – with special attention for his purse, of course. It would certainly not do to carry his payment home in his mouth.


He’d never hear the end of it if he accidentally swallowed half the gold. 


But such worries were unfounded, as always. All was well as he continued his comfortable journey, the green miles of the forest drifting past beneath him until it gradually thinned into the small patch of cleared farmland around the village. He swooped lower as he approached, people looking up to wave at him as he passed overhead. Darryl returned their greetings with a few showy twirls and jets of flame, children laughing and chasing after him as he rolled and looped.


Then he passed over the village border proper, backwinging to slow his approach and come to a soft landing in the large fenced-in square behind the town hall. He shook himself and began to unclip his harness, letting the large logs and sacks of raw ore he carried drop to the turf.


He was busily sorting them all into manageable piles when the doors to the hall opened and Gareth, his Father-in-Law, stepped out. The round, jolly man grinned widely at him as he approached, stepping up to thump Darryl’s side affectionately.


“Darryl, my boy! Good to see you again!”


Darryl flicked his tail in acknowledgement. “Good to see you as well, pops! I hope you are all keeping well?”


“Always better for seeing you, my scaly son! How’s my wayward daughter?”


“Grumpy, broody, and eating me out of hoard and home, pops. In short, the very picture of health for an expectant dam!”


Gareth threw his head back and laughed uproariously. “Hah! I remember her mother being much the same! Well, don’t you fret. I’ll make sure you’re well-stocked with her favourite sweets and pastries when you set off for home again.”


Darryl bobbed his head. “Appreciate it, pops. I wouldn’t mind a few hundred pounds of mutton, myself–”


*”Stop, foul creature! Leave that good man alone, and be ye gone from this peaceful village!”*


With a start, Darryl sat back on his haunches, breathing a small puff of flame involuntarily. He craned his neck in the direction of the sudden yell, one wing dipped down to shield Gareth.


Then he blinked, seeing the strange sight arrayed before him.


Four outlandish figures stood at the ready inside the fence, apparently having climbed over instead of using the unlocked gate just a few yards away from them. They looked one and all like something out of a travelling mummer’s band, dressed head-to-toe in garish garments and brandishing – *weapons?*
