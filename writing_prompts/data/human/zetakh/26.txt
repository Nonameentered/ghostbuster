**Part One of Two**

*“Lycanthropy Draconis.* The results are, I’m sorry to say, pretty conclusive.”

I took a deep breath, exhaling a puff of smoke involuntarily. The acrid smell of it tickled my nose, and I sneezed – blowing a small flame clear across the examination room.

Doctor Mara had been wise enough to stand slightly to one side of me as she spoke. She merely lost her clipboard.

“Sorry,” I said, scratching at my nose. “So apart from, uh, what I just did, anything else I need to look out for?”

“Well,” she answers, absently tossing the scorched remnants of her clipboard into a bin, “there’s your triggers. Those will be the most important factor to stay aware of if we’re going to manage your condition going forward.”

I frown. “Full moon, innit, like any were-strain?”

“Not *just* full moons in your case, I’m sorry to say.” She steps over to a cabinet and retrieves a relatively thin book, then starts leafing through it. “You are familiar with the behaviour of dragons in storybooks and myth, right?”

“Well, sure. Greedy, kidnap virgins, hoarding–”

“Ah! Here.” She turns the book around for me to read. “Number one and three of what you just mentioned is what we’re concerned with.”

I lean forward. “Unlike most other strains of Lycanthropy,” I read aloud, “the Dragon variety has a few additional triggers that need to be managed to avoid untimely transformations. Of these, the hoarding instinct is the most critical. Sufferers of *Lycanthropy Draconis* are, much like dragons in stories, driven to collect and hoard, and this desire can be overwhelming to the point of triggering the transformation. Should a sufferer be confronted with an object, or more often, a *collection* of said object – like a storefront or artistic display – a transformation is very much a risk.”

I trail off, slowly lifting my gaze again to look at Dr. Mara. She nods gravely.

“Indeed, Mr. Richards. Now, we need to go over your full moon plans, as well as some measures you need to take after your transformation has run its course–”

The rest of the conversation passes in a blur. Before long, I find myself discharged and on the street in front of the hospital, still somewhat dazed by the diagnosis and what it’ll mean. A handful of cabbies look over hopefully, but I turn and start walking, instead. A bit of time in the fresh air will do me good. Besides, there’s a coffee shop ‘round the corner.

Armed with a fresh latte loaded with way too much sugar, I keep walking. The sweet drink makes me feel at least *slightly* better.

Good enough to give Dave a call.

He picks up on the second ring. “Hey babe! You okay? What did the doc say?”

I take a deep breath – exhaling slowly this time, mindful of what happened in the hospital room – and answer. “Well, it’s official. I’ve got Lycanthropy alright.”

“Aw, hell. Well, babe, at least it isn’t rabies! Lycanthropy is manageable, so what if you turn into a puppy every full moon–”

“Uh, not that exact type of Lycanthropy, hun. I’m not a were-*wolf.* I’m a were-*dragon.*”

There’s a long pause before Dave answers. “That’s a *thing?*”

I can’t help but laugh. “Apparently! Just my luck that I got the rarest and trickiest one to manage!”

“Trickiest how?”

“Well, it has a few more triggers than most. Full moon is still the major one, but y’know how storybook dragons always have their hoards of gold?”

“Oh no,” Dave says. “Don’t tell me you’re gonna be flying around stealing treasure and cute young boys and/or girls!”

“I might, but what we really have to look out for is if I spot something I really *want*. That can kick the hoarding instinct off so hard I’ll just turn right then and there.”

“Oh boy. Well, gotta make sure to keep you away from bookstores and Lego, then!”

“Heh, yeah–”

I freeze. I’m half-aware of my phone slipping through my fingers.

“Babe?” Dave calls, distantly. “You okay?”

I am *not* okay. My heart is racing as I stare, transfixed, at what I just saw when I came around the corner. I’m dimly aware of my skin crawling and my coffee mug joining my phone on the street, but I can’t look away.

I’d completely forgotten what street I was on. Right there are my two favourite stores in town.

The *Sci-Fi Bookstore,* and right next to it, the *Lego Centre.*

*Fuck.*

It doesn’t take long for the itching tingle in my skin to turn to pain as the transformation starts. My nails pop off, pushed aside by the emerging bony claws beneath. I scratch myself, tearing off the loose skin that’s starting to slough off like a snake’s shed. My back hurts like *hell.*

People are screaming. I hear a distant siren.

Then, before the transformation is even completely finished, I start running.

My vision goes weird, then I black out.
