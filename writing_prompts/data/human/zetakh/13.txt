*Part One of Two*

“Oh great dragon,” the bearded old man yelled up at the newly-dug hollow, “We offer you this virgin sacrifice, that you may leave our village in peace!”

“I’m not a virgin!” the intended sacrifice shrieked, kicking and biting at her captors. “Let me go, you inbred bumpkins!”

The old man winced, shooting a deadly glare at the woman while gesturing angrily at the men who were struggling to tie her to the post they’d stuck into the ground. “Silence the wench before she ruins everything!”

“Who are you calling wench, you decrepit old– mmmph!”

One of the men got a gag on her, swearing as he nearly lost a finger to her teeth for the trouble.

“I say again, great dragon, this *virgin* sacrifice, of supple flesh and high spirit, we offer in your honour! Please accept, and leave our village in peace!”

The ground shook as a long, drawn-out groan rumbled down from the hollow above. The sacrifice stared up at it, wide-eyed, while the men stumbled backwards, leaving their leader standing alone beside the post.

A large reptilian head emerged from within the cave, sending loose dirt tumbling down the slope. The dragon glared down at the assembled crowd, smoke drifting from its nostrils as it snorted.

“A sacrifice?” it sighed, raising a scaly eyebrow. “No. Absolutely not. I have had quite enough of such foolishness, thank you. Be off with you, I have no interest in your sacrifice *or* your village.”

Then the dragon withdrew, leaving the men scratching their heads and the sacrifice sagging in her restraints with relief.

The old man was left nonplussed. If the dragon wouldn’t take her, how was he to get rid of this trouble-maker? Giving the witch to a dragon was well and good, but coming back with her in tow, the sacrifice rejected? He’d be a laughingstock! 

He turned to look at her where she hung from her restraints, her legs weak from terror. She looked up to meet his eyes and pulled at the ropes that bound her meaningfully, wordlessly asking to be released.

The old man’s eyes narrowed. No, he wouldn’t be having that. He had to take back control of the situation.

“Clearly our lord dragon is not hungry for the moment!” he proclaimed. “The beast will accept our offering in due course.” He stepped forward and cupped his hands to call up the hill again. “Your sacrifice awaits your pleasure, oh great dragon!”

“What?” the loud, deep voice replied. “I thought I told you all–”

As the dragon once again emerged from its burrow, steaming with annoyance, they turned their attention to the spectacle below again – to find the poor woman they’d strung up abandoned, shrieking through her gag and tearing desperately at her restraints.

Of the men, there was absolutely no sign.

The dragon blinked. It emerged fully, rearing up onto two legs to look around, its head turning this way and that as it scanned the forest surrounding its lair.

Nothing.

“Oh for the love of–” it rumbled, settling back down with a *thump.* It turned to look at its “sacrifice”, still trying their very best to rip themselves free. 

With another snort of annoyance, the dragon began walking down the slope towards her.

The woman’s eyes went wide with terror as the dragon began to approach. She redoubled her efforts, pushing at the pole with her feet as she tore at the ropes, nearly flipping herself upside-down in her desperation. The dragon approached leisurely, its tongue occasionally flicking through the air as it approached, looking at her.

As its shadow fell upon her, the woman froze, so afraid she couldn’t move any more.

The dragon leaned closer, its maw opening wide to reveal sword-length teeth, glistening with saliva.

The sacrifice closed her eyes, tears spilling down her cheeks.

There was a deafening *crack* of splitting wood and she fell forward, her restraints abruptly severed. She gasped as she tumbled to the turf and looked up to see the dragon casually flinging the top of the post away to crash down in the forest hundreds of yards away. The woman took the opportunity to scramble to her feet and flee. She dashed pell-mell towards the treeline, breathing hard around her gag–

Then she tripped on the trailing ropes that still tied her hands.

“Careful now, little lady.”

A huge claw neatly caught her as she fell, closing around her torso and lifting her from the ground. She wriggled desperately, but she was held fast by the monstrously strong talons as the dragon lifted her to its face.

*This is it*, she thought, as that terrible maw opened before her again. *Now I’m lunch for–*

The teeth closed on the ropes, neatly tearing through the thick cords like knives through warm butter.

“There. Much better, don’t you think?”

The sacrifice boggled, dumbfounded, at the gigantic head as it inspected her, its warm breath tousling her hair as it breathed. The smooth scales glistened in the noonday sun, and the dragon’s huge eyes twinkled as it looked at her.

“You can take that cloth from your mouth if you wish,” it rumbled, amused. “I cannot imagine it being comfortable.”

The woman jumped, then reached to do just that, throwing the soaked, less-than-clean cloth away. “Uh,” she croaked, “did you get rid of the ropes to make me taste better, great dragon?”

The dragon snorted and shook its head. “Sandstone, no, I want nothing to do with eating humans, virgins or not, thank you very much! I know where that ends. You eat one, then another, so on and so forth, then some adventurer hears of a podunk village offering their young women to the local dragon for supper and before you know it they’ve gathered all their friends to slay you and loot your home!” The dragon thumped their tail and rustled its wings. “No, I came out here to get away from all that rot. To live in peace, bask in the sun, perhaps find myself a fine male and have some hatchlings. I did not even know there was a village nearby when I dug my burrow!”

“So…” the woman ventured, beginning to hope, “I’m free to go? You can put me down?”

“Oh, certainly, though I do believe introductions are in order at this point, since it does appear we are to be neighbours. I am Kamacite. What may I call you, little one?”

“Oh! I’m Falina, Falina Gloomwood!” she grabbed one of Kamacite’s talons and shook it. “Pleased to meet you, Kamacite! And thank you very much for not eating me!”

“Don’t mention it, Falina! Humans don’t taste particularly good anyway.” She set Falina down gently, then stretched. “Do you wish me to return you to your village, Falina?”

Falina, somewhat disconcerted by the statement, shook herself and scowled. “I’d rather not go back there, thank you, but I do need to go past my hut and grab my stuff before they get the idea to burn it down. And I should say goodbye to Linda…”

“Burn down your hut? Were you *that* disliked in your home village?”

“No, only by the elder – that walking corpse you heard do all the shouting before. He caught me and Linda in her bed and decided I was a witch who’d put a spell on her! That’s why he picked me to be your sacrifice!”

Kamacite tilted her head. “Did you put a spell on her? *Are* you a witch?”

“No! Yes! Both! Gah!” Falina threw her hands in the air. “I *am* a witch, it’s a respectable profession, but *no*, I didn’t put a spell on Linda, we just happened to love each other!”

“Ah, Linda is your mate! How delightful!” Kamacite bobbed her head. “Then we must go get her, of course!”

Falina blinked. “How?”

“Oh, I can think of a way…”
