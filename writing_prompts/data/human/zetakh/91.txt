# Wanderer

The moon and stars shone bright in the darkness of the night sky as the Wanderer stumbled through the knee-high snow.
  

  
The Wanderer did not have a goal in mind, yet still they walked on. They knew that to stop was to accept death, as the biting teeth of Winter would catch up and gnaw through the feeble protection of the Wanderer's clothing. The Wanderer could feel them supping on their limbs, drinking in the warmth of the Wanderer's blood. Leaving only cold to flow back to their heart, slowly draining the life that remained.
  
  
  
They shivered as feeling fled their fingers. They lifted their eyes to the horizon and took in the glittering, ice-faceted surface of the undisturbed snow ahead. 
  
  
  
'At least they would make a beautiful corpse', the Wanderer mused. 'Frozen upon the snow, skin painted with frost like faience upon a frit figurine. Preserved within this icy land, just as pristine as the land itself.'
  
  
  
No sooner had they given life to the thought did the Wanderer trip, falling hard onto the icy ground. Icy needles prickled their face as they floundered in the snow, gasping breaths burning with the cold.

'And so it ends,' the Wanderer thought. 'I have not the strength to rise. Come, Winter. Claim your prize.'

They rolled over to look upon the stars as they wheeled overhead. A beautiful view to lull them to their rest.

But as they stared up into the heavens, the stars did not keep their ordered place. With fascination, the Wanderer saw them rearrange, the constellations themselves twisting into new meaning.

*Follow me until Friday.*

The Wanderer blinked as a shooting star passed through the twinkling words. They craned their head to follow its passing as it lit up the sky.

The Wanderer smiled. 'A grand display. Yet I have not the strength to follow anywhere, or anywhen.'

Their eyes began to close.

"Will you not follow, Wanderer?"

The voice that spoke was not the one the Wanderer had expected. "You are not Winter."

"No, I am not. I am Dragon."

"Was the message in the stars of your making, Dragon?"

"It was indeed. Written on the firmament with a quill of dreams and ink of stardust. An invitation, to help pluck you from Winter's jaws."

"I appreciate the aid, Dragon. But I have not the strength to accept."

"So I see, Wanderer. Lucky for you, I am fond of you, and find fascination in fabulisms. Give me your hand."

The Wanderer reached for the voice, stiff fingers grasping frozen air. Something light as a feather and soft as down pressed into their palm, and a hand helped theirs close.

"What do you wish for, Wanderer?" The Dragon asked.

"I wish for warmth, Dragon."

"Then hold your wish in your mind, and write hope into this tragedy."

*The Wanderer came upon a campfire, burning brightly in the night.*

Heat blossomed upon the Wanderer's skin.

"Greetings," said Fire. "Sit by my side, Wanderer, and be warmed."
