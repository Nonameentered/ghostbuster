“Why not?”

I blinked, completely nonplussed at the question. “What do you mean *why not*, whelp? Because I am a dragon! We are not tour guides!”

The tiny thing that looked up at me tilted their head sideways, face scrunched up. “Why?”

“I just told you why, whelp!” I leaned down to peer at them. “I am a dragon, and have far more important things to do than answer inane questions!”

They seemed to consider that for a moment. “Like what?”

That gave me pause. What *had* I been doing? I looked about my cave, taking stock. I was curled up on top of my cosy hoard, the shifting coins pleasant against my hide. The obvious conclusion was that I had been asleep, but for some reason admitting that felt vaguely shameful. I waffled while the young human stared intently at me, waiting for my response.

My gaze fell on my own claws and the dull black scales of my feet. *Aha!*

I snorted. “I was *grooming* myself, if you must know, whelp.” I bent to suit word to deed, licking and nibbling at my scales.

“Why?”

I paused to glare at the little intruder again. “Because personal hygiene is *very* important, whelp. One must clean themselves regularly to not be dirty.”

The little human seemed to consider this, looking down at their hands. Then they raised them to their mouth and began to lick their palms, before rubbing their face.

“Ick.”

“Oh for the love of– stop that, whelp, you’re only making it worse.” I bent down and picked them up by the thick fur of their neck. They yelped and wriggled as I held them aloft, then gently sat them down upon my forelegs. “You are all over dirt, whelp.”

I held them down gently as I bent to clean them properly, ignoring their protests. They tasted frightfully dirty, covered in dust and forest mud. When I was finally satisfied, I leaned back to inspect them again. 

“How did you become so dirty, whelp? Does your dam or sire not bother to care for you?”

They wiped their eyes, then stared up at me. “What’s a dam? And a sire?”

I rolled my eyes. “Your *caretakers*, whelp. Your…” I clicked my claws on the stone of my floor, trying to find the word. “Your *parents*, whelp. Do they not care for you?”

The whelp’s face scrunched up again. They sniffed, then covered their face with their hands.

I tilted my head as they curled up in my arms and started to make a strange rhythmic noise, like shallow breaths deep in their throat. “Whelp? What are these noises you are making?”

They sniffed and shook their head, curling tighter on themselves. Something twisted in my chest, familiar and unwelcome. Like the terror I’d felt when one of my own young had been in distress, last I had a brood to care for. I bent down and nudged them carefully with my snout. 

“What is your name, whelp?” I murmured.

They sniffed again, but uncurled enough to look at me. “M-Maria.”

“Very well, Maria. I am Onyx. What distresses you so?”

“I… I dunno where my parents are. I got lost.”

I nudged them again. “So that is why you asked me for directions.”

“Mm-hmm.”

“Well, little Maria – do you know where we can *find* your parents, perhaps? Does your home have a name?”

“I, I think so?” She sat up and leaned against my cheek. “Um, uh… Silverstream Village?”

I tilted my head, considering. There was a mountain not far from here that I know to be rich in silver. Some fragments of ore being carried down to the lowlands with the snowmelt and rain would be quite possible. 

And I could never fault the humans for their taste in treasure. That there could be a village near the stream, with people sifting for silver… Quite likely.

“Very well, Maria. I think I know where we can find your home. Come.”

I picked her up by her furry scruff again and began to walk through my cave, heading towards the entrance. She dangled from my mouth, making quiet *whee* noises as she swung back and forth with every stride I took.

As we stepped outside into the dazzling sunlight of the outdoors, I put her down in my palm and carefully closed my claws around her.

“Do not squirm too much, Maria. It would not do to drop you.”

I tensed, crouched down low – then I snapped my wings open, jump, and *fly*.

Maria shrieked as we climbed, rising high into the sky. I levelled out as we crested the hilly trees that concealed my home and began to glide in a wide, slow circle, looking down at the forest below as my charge laughed with a mix of terror and delight in my grip.

Soon I saw a few gentle plumes of smoke near the foot of the silvered mountain. I banked to approach, first flying in a wide arc around the village to look more closely at it. Then I chose a suitable landing spot at the village’s edge, and began my gentle descent.

Small figures froze beneath me as my shadow fell upon them, then ran for cover as I landed, my wings kicking up huge clouds of dust. I turned to shield Maria from the worst of it, then set her down on the ground. 

“Is this your village, Maria?” I asked, looking about the now-deserted streets.

She looked at the nearby houses, one hand holding onto my talon. “I’m not sure. Can we find mommy?”

I peered at the little street that the entire village was centred around and the little square in the middle. “I believe I can fit. We shall look.”

Careful to not sweep a building away with my tail or wings, I walked alongside Maria as she ventured into the village, staring intently at each house we passed.

As we came to the square, I sat down on my haunches, Maria holding my talon as she looked about, looking miserable. She looked up at me, her eyes watery.

“I dunno which house is mine,” she whispered, so quietly I barely heard it.

I snorted. “Don’t worry, Maria. We will just have to make your parents come to *you.*” I gently picked her up with my talons again, cupping her within my palms. Then I cleared my throat, took a deep breath, and breathed a large plume of fire straight into the air.

“Villagers of Silverstream!” I roared. “I have little Maria here, recently lost within my woods! Her parents had best come get her, or else I shall claim her as mine own!”

“Huh?” Maria gasped, looking up at me.

I winked at her, then heard the gratifying noise of a door slamming open, followed by running steps.

“Give me back my daughter, you overgrown, scaly *bat*, or I’ll make shoes out of your hide!”

The woman who came charging at me was broad of shoulder and long of limb, with a thunderous expression on her face – like a mother bear protecting her cub. She brandished a well-kept axe at me as she came, her hands tight upon its girp.

I hold up a claw placatingly. “Peace, human. I have no desire to keep Maria, should she wish to rejoin you.” I lower my claws to the ground and turn Maria to face her. 

The little girl shone up like the sun and leapt from my grasp. “Mommy!”

“Maria!”

I nodded with satisfaction and turned to go. My temporary charge was back where she belonged. ‘Twas past time I returned to my hoard.

A mere few steps later, I felt a tug upon my tail. 

I turned around and saw Maria, holding tightly to the very tip of my tail as it dragged upon the ground. “Maria?”

She let go and ran at me, throwing herself at my face and rubbing her cheeks with my own. 

“Thank you,” she murmured, sniffling. “For helping me get home.”

Something lurched in my chest. “You are welcome, little one. You be careful in the future now – do not get lost again.”

“I won’t.” She let go and stepped back, looking up at me. “Can I come visit?”

I gave her mother a level look and received a soul-searing one in return. “Perhaps when you are older and can find your way better.”

“Okay.” She pauses. “Can *you* come visit?”

I snorted. “I should like to see the one to stop me!”

She gave me another hug, then she scampered back to her mother’s side and waved as I stepped back outside the village and took off.

Perhaps asking a dragon for directions was not so unwise after all…
