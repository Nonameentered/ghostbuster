# The Slaughterhouse

Rural darkness loomed over everything as the beaten-up old car rumbled over the decrepit road, the wheels bouncing over the tough tufts of grass that fought to reclaim the trail. 

“How much further, Vicky?”

“Not sure, Erin. GPS lost signal thirty minutes ago, but it can’t be much farther.”

“I hope you’re right. If we don’t find it soon we’re gonna have to turn back, we’re nearly down to half gas and I am *not* getting stranded out here in the middle of the night.”

“Amen– wait, what’s that?”

A rusted fence rose out of the darkness, its decaying gate swinging back and forth in the faint wind as it dragged a broken chain through the dirt beneath it.

Vicky stopped the car. “Well, saves us the trouble of breaking in. Go hold it open while I drive through.”

Erin smirked. “You want me to get out of the car in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere?”

“Yeah, I know. You’re gonna get murdered. But someone’s gotta open the gate, and I’m driving!”

“Yes’m. If I get grabbed by cannibal yokels, come get me!” she said, hopping out of the car and walking over to the gate.

“If that happens, I’ll choose dyspathy and life and leave you here!”

Erin flipped her the bird, then grabbed the old gate and pulled. She grunted with the effort as she heaved the hunk of rust out of the way with a shriek of hinges, then waved Vicky through and turned to follow.

She yelped as she felt something prick her palm, the gate slipping from her grasp.

“What happened?” Vicky asked.

“Scratched my hand on the gate,” Erin answered, getting back in. She pressed her sleeve into her palm, wiping away the small swell of blood. “Not bad, though, but I’m definitely gonna need a tetanus shot.”

“There should be band-aids in the bag. Let’s be careful in there now.”

Soon the road ended, replaced by an overgrown gravel parking lot. Beyond it lay their destination, a small mountain of metal and darkness loomed out of the night like the corpse of a starving giant.

The Slaughterhouse.

They stopped and got out, staring up at the foreboding building.

“Well,” Erin murmured, “this is it.”

“Yep,” Vicky concurred. “Let’s go.”

They jogged up to the main entrance, their torches illuminating the massive metal doors and the sign above it.

“*A Serious House on Serious Earth,*” Vicky read. “Morbid.”

“But not wrong.” Erin tried the door. “Nope, rusted shut. Not getting in that way.”

“Damn.” Vicky cast her torchlight about, searching. “There.”

A large fenced-in pen stood ahead of them, funnel-shaped and attached to the building’s wall.

Erin blanched. “Fuck. Okay.” 

They climbed through the wide bars of the cattle intake and approached the rusted opening, still veiled by yellowing plastic curtains.

As they paused in front of the entryway, wind whispered past them and into the old building with a sound like a rattling breath. As if something dwelled there, a hungering beast awoken from slumber. 

Vicky shuddered. “Ready?”

“Not really,” Erin answered. “But we’re here. Let’s go.”

Vicky nodded, then ducked through the curtain.

Erin steeled herself and brushed the curtains aside, shuddering as the stained plastic brushed over her injured palm.

She straightened, looking back to see a fresh stain of blood mingling with the old. “Shit.”

“Damn,” Vicky said. She’d climbed out of the fenced-in path and was standing on an old conveyor belt, her torch casting about. “Look at this place.”

Erin swept her own torch around to take it in. Antiquated tools hung from hooks and lay scattered on the floor – knives, saws, cleavers, things that had no name. Every inch of them coated in rust and ancient, dark-brown stains.

She was about to answer when she heard a noise. A strange, rhythmic sound of metal on metal, mixed with the rattle of chain and the groan of machinery.

“Did you hear that?”

Vicky nodded. “I did. We should–”

The conveyor belt started. 

Vicky yelled, stumbling off the belt and onto the floor, hissing as her knee hit the concrete.

“Vicky! Are you o–” Erin shrieked as sudden pain erupted in her injured hand, something tearing at her injured flesh. She looked down and saw a rusted hook buried in her palm, a chain pulled taught behind it.

Pulling *her* along the cattle track.

“Vicky!” she cried, *Help me!*”

Vicky stared, frozen with horror. A jagged black gate was opening at the far end of the cattle track, blood-red light spilling out between glistening iron teeth as a hungry sigh swept over the killing floor.

Another hook erupted from the yawning maw and buried itself in Erin’s leg.

The chains pulled.

“It hurts! *Vicky!*”

Vicky chose life.

She left Erin there.
