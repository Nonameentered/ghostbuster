The politicians called them Vile Sinners. Disgusting Abominations. Crimes against God and Country.

The police thought of them as crimes too, but they avoided the fiery rhetoric of the politicians in favor of more earthy descriptions such as "Nuisances", "Twerps", and - after discovering a particularly egregious crime scene - "Those Fuckin' A-holes".

Detective Lawrence "Law" Rudy was currently at one of those those crime scenes, and the last of those descriptions was currently bouncing around his skull as he looked on at the horrors of what had once been an upstairs attic. Now it was something else.

Everyone knew what a good attic should look like. Stacks of old cardboard boxes, held together more by packing tape than any remaining tree fibers, overflowing with decades old clothes and Christmas ornaments. In one corner would be a heap of trunks inherited from a childless great aunt that had been stuck up here after the funeral and never opened since. And there might even be a few boxes of your own childhood memories, kept by your parents in fond remembrance, and put up here to be forgotten. Everything would be covered by a thick layer of dust.

Law Rudy stared around the attic and didn't recognize any of these features. This was troubling, as it was his own attic.

For starters, there was no dust. Somebody had been up here and thoroughly cleaned out the attic. Most of the old boxes had been moved aside and stacked against the end wall. In their place was a makeshift desk, complete with a that most forbidden of items - a computer. Wires stretched out of the back of the evil device and ran down through the attic floor. One of them was connected to a blinking port. Rudy had seen enough of these illegal set-ups before to recognize that whoever had set this up had tapped in to the house's phone lines to connect the computer to the Internet.

The thought made Rudy feel a little sick. "Son of a-"

Somebody was trying to set him up! They'd found out who he was and where he lived, and they were trying to frame him as one of them. What a coup that would be for them! He could see the headline already: "Notorious Nerd-Catcher Law Rudy is one of Them."

Rudy peered closer at the desk, and his jaw dropped. There were a number of cartoonish pictures pinned up behind it, and he recognized the figure in each of them. Madame Mirage. One of the most wanted Nerds in the country.

The trapdoor to the attic creaked behind him, and Rudy's hand went to his waist. He cursed when his hand closed on empty cold air. Of course he wasn't wearing his gun. This was his own house! Instead he crouched, ready to pounce on whatever evil-doer was coming up through the trapdoor.

A small head appeared, a woman's, with short spiky hair, highlighted pink at the tips-

"Josie?!"

"Dad."

Law Rudy stared at his daughter, and wondered if his face looked as shocked as hers.

"Josie, what are you doing up here?"

But even as he asked the question, he knew the answer.

"Josie," he began, not quite knowing what he was going to say next, but he saw something harden in her eyes, something that had been growing over the past year and which he'd been trying to ignore.

"Oh, cut it out, Dad," she said. She climbed all the way up into the attic and stood facing him. "I know you're a hypocrite."

"Do you know what you've done?" he whispered, fearing that his wife might hear. This was still salvageable. He could pull some strings, lean on some people, protect his little girl as best as he could (although she'd drawn herself up to her full height, and he realized for the first time that she was no longer the little girl that he remembered). "Do you know what they will do to us?"

Josie reached down and pulled a small box out of the desk. "Is that what you used to think when you were my age?"

She handed it to him, and he took it with trembling hands. He recognized it immediately. How could it he not - it said "Property of Lawrence Rudy" in large letters on the front. But he could have sworn that he'd burned these long ago.

"I found these up here in one of the boxes," Josie said.

Rudy opened the box and let the contents slide out into his hands. It was a deck of cards, covered with illustrations even more beautiful that he remembered. A small, folded instruction leaflet came out of the box last. It fell open in his hand and he saw the familiar words and felt a familiar rush sweep over him.

"Welcome," the words on the leaflet said, "to Magic: The Gathering."
