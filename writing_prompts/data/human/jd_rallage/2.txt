A pilgrimage to the imaginatively named town of Sword-in-the-Stone was a rite of passage in every young Angle's life. Come of age and travel across the kingdom to test your worthiness, and hope that you would be the one who could free the eponymous sword and become the rightful King or Queen of the Angles.

Brinda had come to Sword-in-the-Stone for that very reason, against the wishes of her parents who felt they had already wasted far too much money on similar journeys for three previous children. But Brinda had grown up on stories of such journeys, listening eagerly as her elder siblings recounted the story of their own attempts, and dreaming of one day placing her own hands on the hilt of the magical sword of Arthur, which would no doubt slide free from the rock.

She had spent long nights weighing up the competing merits of the town's two inns, which stood opposing each other around Sword Square, and debating which she should stay in. The Might of Merlin was said to have the better ale, but more lice than the The King's Sword. All the best stories seemed to have their start in the Might of Merlin, but after two weeks on the road, and too many nights in bad inns, she was now firmly in favor of The King's Sword.

She had arrived in the town in early afternoon. The town had sprung up around it's central attraction, and the main road led her straight to the central square and the two inns that stood watch over the stone.

One of Brinda's brothers had told her that the line of aspirants had stretched around the square, but today the place was empty save for a lone street sweeper.

It was also empty of any sign of a sword in a stone. Where there should have been a large rock in the center of the square was now just a bare patch of ground.

Brinda approached the street sweeper. "Um, excuse me, sir, but is this where I find the Sword in the Stone?"

The man looked at her glumly. "Gone."

"What?"

"Gone."

Brinda felt a pang of fear. "Somebody was able to take the sword?"

"Aye."

She looked around again. "But where's the stone?"

"Gone," said the old man, even more glumly, and went back to sweeping.

Brinda wondered if taking the sword had been as hard for the presumptive new ruler of Angland as it was to get words out of this man. She tried one last time, "Who took it? The sword, I mean, not the stone."

"Dwarves," said the sweeper. Then he jabbed the handle of his broom in the direction of the Far Mountains, and with an apparently Herculean effort added, "Took both."

---

The Far Mountains had lived up to their name. They had not seemed that far from Sword-in-the-Stone, perhaps a day's ride, but it had taken her a whole week to make it to the foothills, and two more days to lead her horse up the increasingly narrow path that was said to lead to the halls of the dwarves.

The air was thin, and Brinda was breathing hard when she rounded the corner and found herself in front of a huge doorway carved into the side of the mountain.

There was a single short figure standing outside the door, helmet pulled down low over its brow against the rain.

Brinda walked up to it. "Hello."

The figure grunted.

"Is this the Hall of the Mountain King?"

Another grunt. Brinda had long since decided that the further north one traveled, the fewer words anyone spoke. Perhaps this was the very edge of the world.

"I'm, er, here because, well..."

"You're here about the sword," the dwarf said.

"Oh. Well, yes. How did you know?"

The dwarf snorted. "I suppose you think you're the first?"

"Oh," Brinda said. She had not met any other travelers on the road north, and had begun to hope.

"Well, don't just stand there in the rain. Better come in and dry your horse before you head back down the mountain."

"Back?" Brinda said. "But I only just got here. Besides, I was hoping to see the sword."

"Hrmph," said the dwarf. "Hoping to steal it, d'you mean?"

"No," Brinda lied, but her face flushed.

The dwarf took off it's helmet, and long hair cascaded down onto rain splashed chain mail. A beard-less face looked up at her and smirked knowingly.

"You're- you're a girl," Brinda said, both surprised and seeing a chance to change the subject.

"A woman," the dwarf corrected. "Seeing as you're also a woman, albeit a young one, I'm a little surprised at your surprise."

"Oh no," Brinda said, and flushed deeper. "It's just, well, in the stories there are never dwarven woman."

The dwarf looked at her speculatively. "Ah, stories. Famous for always being true, stories are." She looked up at Brinda, and then suddenly sighed. "Come on young lady. Your horse looks almost dead from cold, and you from hunger. Your rub down your horse, and I'll get you a bowl of soup to warm you up."

---

Brinda sat at the stone table, and ate the hot soup at fast as she could without scorching her mouth. The dwarven woman sat across from her, occasionally glancing out at the deserted path up the mountain, but mostly watching the human eat.

When the bowl was empty, the dwarf said, "So you'll be off now."

The rain was coming down harder now, lashing the mountain side as gusts of wind swirled over the crags.

"I suppose so," Brinda said. She hesitated, wanting to ask a question that had been burning on her tongue nearly as badly as the soup. "So what will you do with the sword?"

"Is that any of your business?"

"No, but..." A thought struck her. "If one of you is the rightful King or Queen, then I should like to pay homage to my new ruler."

The dwarf snorted. "The rightful King?"

"Or Queen."

"Because of a sword?"

"It's not just any sword," Brinda said defensively. "It's the sword of Arthur, given to him by the Lady in the Lake, and sealed in the stone by Merlin to await one worthy enough to free it."

The dwarf snorted. "What did I tell you about stories?"

"Well, this one is true," Brinda said. "It has to be, otherwise... otherwise..."

"Otherwise you came all this way for nothing," said the dwarf, but gently.

Brinda looked at her helplessly.

The dwarf sighed. "Do you know why Merlin put that sword in the damn stone in the first place? No, I mean do you know why he claimed that only the true ruler would be able to pull it out? Because when Arthur died without an heir, all the barons fell to squabbling about who would be the next king. But Angland was still at war back then, so Merlin put the sword in the stone to stop them arguing for long enough to defend their borders."

Brinda frowned. "But what if one of the barons had been able to draw the sword?"

"Ah," the dwarf said knowingly. "Merlin, being a wizard and thus a crafty bugger, melted the sword so that it fused to the rock."

"But then nobody would ever be able to draw it? Didn't Merlin want there to be another King?"

"Or Queen," the dwarf amended, and winked. "Perhaps. Who knows. Rather inconveniently, he died, or disappeared (nobody's quite sure, since they never found his body) before he could undo the spell."

"So all this time we've been trying to achieve an impossible task? Did the dwarves know?"

The dwarf grinned. "Wasn't hard to see that the rock had been melted if you know a little about geology. Oh don't look like that. Sure, it gave us a few chuckles over our ale on the long winter nights, but it seemed to give you lot something to do that would keep you out of mischief."

Brinda fought down her indignation, and asked in a voice of forced calm, "So how did you manage to draw the sword then? I didn't think dwarves could cast spells."

"There are many kinds of magic," said the dwarf. "And the best kind, in my opinion, is the kind you do with logic and elbow grease."

"Meaning?"

"Meaning," said the dwarf with the patience of explaining something to a child, "that we chiseled down the rock and took the sword. What was left of it."

"It was a magical sword," Brinda said. "Hardened by sorcery to pierce the thickest armor-"

"And left out in the rain and the snow and goodness knows what other kinds of weather for over two hundred years," the dwarf said. "It was more rust than metal at this point. Frankly it's a wonder it hadn't disintegrated into pieces when some young fool yanked on the hilt."

"So you're going to repair it?" Brinda asked hopefully.

"Honey," said the dwarf pityingly, "it was melted down for scrap."

Brinda said nothing for a long while. "But why?"

The dwarf shrugged. "That's for the Mountain King to know, and you and me to speculate. But-" she lowered her voice, "-just between you and me, I've been hearing worrying news about the kingdoms to the south. Rumors of invasion. And how the Regency of Angland is divided by internal power struggles and lack of leadership. Perhaps this will... reset the field."

"So this is all just politics?"

"It ends," said the dwarf, "as it began."
