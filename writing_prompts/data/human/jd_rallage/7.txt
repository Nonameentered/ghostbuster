There was a time when the boy had been afraid of bats. But he had learned that fears could be faced, that terror could be overcome. Now the little bat-ling flittered around the boy's bedroom, crashing off the walls in a panicked fluttering of wings.

"It's ok," the boy said softly. "It's ok, little one."

He held out his hand. At first, the bat did not seem to hear him, but with continued coaxing, the boy managed to get the little creature to settle in his hand. They stared at each other for a moment, a pair of blue eyes meeting another pair that were completely black.

Involuntarily, they boy shivered. Perhaps he hadn't quite gotten over his fear of bats just yet. Or maybe it was just those soulless-looking eyes. He carried the little creature over to the window and let it out.

He went back to bed. He would tell Alfred about it tomorrow.

*Twenty years later...*

The man in the black outfit and cape was thrown back against the alley wall. A rusted iron pole, snapped off into a jagged point, pieced the body armor of his suit and stabbed into his side.

The man grunted in pain. He pushed himself up, wrenching the spike from his body. Drops of blood dripped out of the gash between kevlar plates, and mixed with the heavy rain coming down, turning the dockyard puddles red.

He tried to rise back up, but staggered and landed heavily on one knee. He was exhausted - battered by the grueling brawl with the new adversary.

In his mind, he heard a voice. *Why do we fall, Master Wayne? So that we can pick ourselves back up again...*

Bruce Wayne - Batman - forced himself back to his feet.

He found himself staring down the barrel of an ornate handgun, carved with intricate silver metalwork. The gun was steady in the motionless gauntleted hand of his adversary. The other man's face was shadowed by the wide brim of a dark hat, and he wore a long coat that flowed down his ankles.

"Where is the crypt?"

Although his face remained a mask, Batman was surprised. The voice that had come out from below the brimmed hat, was low and rough, but unmistakeably female.

"Who the hell are you?" he managed to say.

"Death," the woman said. "But tell me what I want to know and I'll put you down quickly, bat. Where are the rest of your kin?"

Below his mask, the corner of Bruce Wayne's mouth curled. "It's just me, villain. I'm the only thing that stands between Gotham City and damnation. So if you want it, come and get it."

He had been tensing himself for a spring, and now he launched forwards. But the woman was impossibly fast. By the time he had covered the five paces to where she stood, she was no longer there. The gun went off to his side, and Batman felt the impact of the bullet smashing into his helmet.

The world went black, briefly, and when the cold splash of water brought him back to consciousness a moment later he was lying in one of the puddles. Rain flowed down his face, and he could taste the blood they carried.

The shadowy figure was above him now, and he dimly heard the sound of another round being chambered in the strange gun.

"Your tough, I'll give you that," the stranger said. "But I've killed tougher in the old country. I'm going to clean this city of its infestation, starting with you."

Batman tried to move, but couldn't. Dimly, he realized that this was the end.

"I, Sonja Van Helsing, free you from your living death, vampire-"

Something slammed into the woman, and Batman heard her fly across the alleyway and crumple into the wall.

There was a hiss, and then an exchange of words in a language he didn't speak. Something Eastern European, he thought. Another shot, and the splintering of brickwork as a bullet went wide.

Then the splash of running feet disappearing into the night.

A figure appeared above him.

Batman dragged himself to his elbows, and found himself staring into a pair of black eyes in paper-white face. The black eyes were soulless. He shivered despite himself.

"Who the hell are you?" he managed, but an old memory resurfaced. He remembered those eyes.

"Consider this a debt repaid," he heard the newcomer say. "The life of Gotham's son for the... life... of my daughter."

A strong hand gripped his arm and pulled him up. "You need the hospital-" The words cut off. There was a sniff. "Blood. You are bleeding."

The arm released him.

"I cannot stay with you," the newcomer said, backing away from him. "Get yourself to a hospital. Silver may not be poisonous to one like you, but bullets still are."

"Wait-" Batman began.

"I shall be in touch," the figure said, and then there was only a bat flitting away into the falling rain. A whisper came back to him. "We have a common enemy now, Bruce Wayne."
