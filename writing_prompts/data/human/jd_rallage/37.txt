"It's just Mr Higgins," one of the night nurses said. "Having nightmares again, the poor dear."

Her companion clucked sympathetically.

*4th June. Slept poorly. Again. Keep seeing her face at night. Can no longer remember what she looks like when I wake up.*

*But perhaps that's just as well.*

Paul Higgins lay in the small bed. His heart was still beating frantically, and for a moment he wondered if he was having another heart attack. Perhaps this one would finally put him out of his misery.

But no. His heart was slowing again, his breathing too, and he could feel no strange tingling in his body apart from the damp mattress beneath him, as his own sweat began to cool and prickle against his back.

He sat up in bed and turned on his night light. The night nurses hadn't come tonight. Perhaps he hadn't been screaming as loud as usual. He would change into a dry set of pajamas, and lay awake in the small bed until the first rays of morning came to his rescue through the curtains.

As he stood up, something white on the floor caught his eye. A small notebook. The notebook Jane had given him a few days earlier. 

"Write down your dreams as soon as you wake up," she'd said. "Maybe then they won't seem so bad."

But he never wrote them down, because he could never remember.

Paul bent down to pick up the notebook, holding onto the bed frame for support. He groaned with relief as he stood back up, as his tight old muscles relaxed.

And then he frowned.

There was something written in the notebook. He fumbled for his reading glasses on the nightstand, and then held the page close to the light.

It was a shaky hand, barely legible, but it was his. He'd written something. A string of random numbers. Wait, there were a couple of letters as well.

He frowned, disappointed. If he'd hoped for answers, and a part of him had leaped excitedly, then he wasn't going to find them in this nonsense.

*1st January 1952. New year, new diary. And one hell of a hangover. Lucy's already up and cooking breakfast. The painful sound of rattling pans is countered by the delicious scent of bacon.*

*Later: Headache finally gone. Must remember I can't drink as much as I used to. Lu went for a walk earlier in the forest and says she found something strange. She wants to show me tomorrow.*

"Oh, you used your notebook!" Jane said. She'd been straightening the sheets on his bed, despite the fact that he'd already made it before she'd arrived, and seen the notebook on the nightstand.

"It's nothing," Paul began to say, but Jane had already picked it up.

She squinted at the shaky script, and then asked in a puzzled tone, "What is it?"

"Nothing," he repeated, hoping she'd drop it. She wouldn't though, he knew. She was too damn cheerful on her worst days, and he could still smell the hyperactive aroma of breakfast coffee lingering in her hair.

"Did you write this after a dream?" She never called them nightmares. Apparently that was 'negative labeling'.

"No," he said.

"Then what is it?"

He was going to get no peace until he told her, so he said, "I must have written it down during a nightmare. A dream, I mean."

Her eyes widened with excitement. "Ooh, Mr Higgins! That's wonderful. It might be your subconscious trying to tell you something."

"Bunch of crap," he muttered, but he didn't say it loud enough for her to hear the swear word. There were some things you didn't say in front of a lady, even if she was annoying the hell out of you.

"It's coordinates," she said, looking at the writing again.

"What?"

"Coordinates. You know, latitude and longitude. A location."

"I know what a damn coordinate is," he said. "Give me."

The girl was right, he realized. He'd laid in bed for five hours trying to make sense of the note, and the girl had figured it out in less time than it took a squirrel to dig up an acorn.

"What's it for?" she said.

"Don't know."

Before he could stop her, she'd pulled out her phone and was typing the coordinate in.

"Ooh, it's close to here. Apparently it's in the middle of the woods behind the old industrial park."

A cold and ominous feeling grew in the back of Paul Higgin's mind. He'd always avoided that part of town, for as long as he could remember. He didn't know why.

"We can go on your morning walk," Jane was saying. "I'll drive us over there, and then we can check it out. It'll be fun. Like a treasure hunt."

Before he could object, she'd bustled out to fetch him breakfast. The smell of freshly cooked bacon drifted in through the open door, and made his stomach churn nauseously.
