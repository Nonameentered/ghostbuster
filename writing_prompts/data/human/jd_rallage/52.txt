"Hey, that's my wallet," I said.

These folks in the future were a rum bunch. Weirdoes, the lot of them. And now one of them had stolen from me!

The man gave me a funny look. "No, it's mine. My brother gave it to me as a birthday present."

"No," I said. "*My brother* gave it to *me*. It was in my pocket just- Oh." I patted my pocket and felt the hard square of my own wallet still there.

The man opened his wallet and I saw my own credit cards lining it. Puzzled, I drew out my own wallet, and found the exact same credit cards.

"Hey," I said softly. He looked at me expectantly. "You're... you're me."

"Well, finally," said a chorus of voices, and I turned to find the whole bar looking at me. They all pulled out exactly the same wallet. My head swam. Twenty different versions of myself blurred. 

When I opened my eyes, I was on the floor, and someone was fanning me with a napkin. I don't know if you've ever been fanned with a napkin, but it's not very effective.

"Don't worry," someone said. "If I remember correctly, you'll feel better in about 5 minutes."

"Nah," said somebody else. "It took at least half an hour before we felt better."

"What," I asked, "is going on?"

A glass of water was thrust into my hand by the barman. "Drink. You'll need it."

I looked at the barman in dismay. He was an unfortunately ugly looking chap. "Are you me too?"

He nodded. "In about ten travels time, you'll come back as me. Just remember: never put good Scotch in a mixed drink. But you'll forget that, of course."

"Where is everyone else?" I said. "Why is it just me?"

The other me's exchanged glances with myselves. "It's a long story. Best that you see for yourself. This is only your third trip, and each time you've come to the 23rd century. Next time, visit the last year of the 21st. But don't stay more than a minute."

I frowned. "Why not?"

"Because," the barman said, "you have to repopulate the human race, and prolonged radiation exposure isn't great for your baby making abilities. Oh, and don't forget your sunglasses. It was rather bright in 2099."
