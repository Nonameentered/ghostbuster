Kryvex stared down at the deactivated Librarian, and then at the book that he still held in his other hand. Great. Now he was in for it.

For the first time since he'd made worldfall on Planet X56, he was glad to be wearing the baggy, ill-fitting robe. As the elevator rose back up to the surface, he slid the book into a pocket and tucked the Librarian under the folds of the robe.

With another ping, the elevator spat him out on an upper floor of the library. Kryvex shot threw the doors and ducked behind the nearest shelving unit.

It was not a moment too soon.

A trio of shiny white Librarian's came hurtling around the stacks and skidded to a halt at the broken door into the elevator. Hot on their tails came two figures, of a species Kryvex didn't recognize immediately. They were a similar size to humans but wore black robes- Holy spacecow!

Kryvex had never seen a human wear anything except brilliant white. Nobody had: humans only ever wore white, a sartorial choice that was the butt of of many jokes about the species. And yet here these two were, lean rangy specimens of their species, one of each sex, and wearing black. The male human stepped forwards through the Librarians and examined the elevator. As he moved, his robe billowed out slightly, and Kryvex caught sight of something strapped to his waist.

The human was carrying a blaster!

All of Kryvex's long-held beliefs about humans began to disintegrate.

While the newcomers were distracted with the elevator, he quietly slipped away towards the Library's exit.

Kryvex reentered in the small pod he'd been assigned at the New London University, and collapsed onto the bed. The nervous adrenaline that he'd been holding in all the way back from the library began to rack his body in huge shivers.

After an hour or so, he began to feel calmer, and fabricated a cup of Uyil-tea. It was good stuff, Uyil-tea, nourished by the unique atmosphere of Uyil, and renowned all over the galaxy as good for nerves. After he'd drunk it, he felt a little better.

He picked the Librarian off the floor, and propped it up on the table. It was dead now, but its alarm must have alerted the other Librarians. He had a million questions he wanted to ask it, but if he reactivated it (assuming he could) then it would just broadcast his position.

So instead Kryvex made some more tea, and opened the book that he's stolen. No, borrowed - back then, he still fully intended to return it.

> ... and thus the storm clouds gathered, ready to burst at the first pinprick, and ominous if we'd but had the sense to look up and see them. But nobody was looking. And so, when the clouds finally did erupt, drowning humanity in their deluge, we were all caught completely by surprise.

> END OF VOLUME 1

~~~

Kryvex put down the book. He'd read straight to the back page without stopping. How long had it been? There were no windows on this planet, as glass could not stop the radiation, but the little clock on the wall suggested it was well into the next morning.

He no longer felt guilty about taking the book. In fact, he wished he'd pocketed the next volume in the series while he'd had the chance.

But between the book and the events at the library, he was certain of one thing: these humans were not what they claimed to be.
