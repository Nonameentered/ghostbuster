I hate the Jumps, when they come.

Or rather, I hate the mornings-after. You try going to work after a night spent in an alternate reality, and tell me you don't feel the same way. It's one night in our time, but it can be anything from five seconds to five decades in the place you Jump to. Makes for one hell of a hangover.

These days, unless the alternate is especially interesting, I try to get out as quickly as possible. Life's too short, even when it doesn't count back in your own world. I've been around for the better part of a millennium, if you tally up the years I've lived in other worlds. It doesn't show - I still look the same as any other 39 year old alcoholic insomniac - but you feel it inside. The mind ages, even if the body doesn't. Some people back home called it wisdom - or used to, anyway - but now I mainly just feel tired. Stretched out.

Living and dying a thousand lives will do that to you.

Contrary to what you might think, being shredded in the void of space is not the most painful way to die. I won't lie and pretend that it was painless, but as least it happened quickly. That was the five seconds, my personal record for shortest Jump. Afterwards, I woke up in my own bed, sweating, and reaching for the bottle I keep on the side-table. To this day, I still have no idea what happened to Earth in that universe. 

No, the worst death is the day-to-day one, the ordinary 9-to-5 death that we sacrifice a little more of our souls to each morning that we knot a tie before sunrise, and leave the house before the kids are up. I've lived plenty of those lives, enough for ten men.

I wake up.

Next to me, my wife stirs. I slip an arm around her, feeling the reassuring warmth of her body. There's no sound of our kids yet.

"What shall we do today?" she asks, still half asleep.

I pause. I have only been in this reality a week, and I still haven't gotten used to it. To the novelty of having a wife, and a family. To a world where, by some miracle, civilization has advanced beyond the need to work, but hasn't destroyed itself in one form or another.

This is a reality I could grow old in.

I smile. "Let's live," I say.
