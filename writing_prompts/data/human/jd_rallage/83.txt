/u/MNBrian's phone buzzed in his pocket.

A new text. From her.

"I'm here. Where are u?"

Where am I? Did she really have the nerve after being three hours late? Even more offensive than her tardiness was the abbreviated pronoun. After three hours she couldn't even take the time to type an extra two letters?

He considered not replying, but that would be rude, and MNBrian, above all other things, like to think that he was a gentleman. Reluctantly he opened his texting app.

"Gone home."

The brevity of the message appealed to him. Succinct and blunt. He could feel the disapproval dripping from the two words. Hopefully she would get the message without any further unpleasantness.

She replied immediately.

"Sorry. You'll never believe what happened to me."

*Oh, I'm sure I will*, MNBrian thought.

"I got mugged. By Hitler and Gordon Ramsey."

A likely story. Who was three hours late for an 8pm coffee date?

"But then a third man saved me. He had superpowers."

He was about to put the phone away in disgust, but it buzzed again. She was persistent, this woman.

"Still wanna meet?"

Really? This late? What time was it, anyway? From where he lay on the couch, the clock on the far wall was strangely blurry.

He felt his hands typing of their own accord.

"Be there in 5"

The coffee house was just around the corner from his apartment. He thought about taking five hours to get there. Let's see how she liked that.

But that would have been rude. His feet didn't let him. His feet carried him straight to the coffee shop.

He recognized her instantly. She was pretty just like in her picture. And she was the only person in the coffee shop. That was strange - it was usually so busy. As he went over, her face changed into an expression of surprise and delight.

"You're the third man who saved me," she squealed, running towards him with her arms open for a hug.

If only all dates were this enthusiastic, MNBrian thought.

"Are you MNBrian?" she asked. She was almost upon him now, but suddenly her face morphed into something different entirely, something hellish. Satanic, demonic? He didn't know. He tried to pull away, but her claws had sunk into his shoulder and she was shaking him and-

/u/MNBrian opened his eyes.

"Excuse me? Are you MNBrian?"

He looked up at the person who was shaking his arm.

A woman was standing there. It was the same woman, but not as pretty as she had been right before she turned into the Devil. Not as pretty as her profile picture had made her out to be, either. They never were. It was all about the angle.

"Hey," MNBrian said. "Er, sorry. I think I dozed off for a second."

"No, I should apologize," she said. "I'm the one who's late. But are you OK? You're sweating."

The coffee shop was busy, as it usually was, even though it was dark outside now and had been for a while. His coffee, barely touched, sat on the table, stone cold. 

The woman was staring at him uncertainly. What was her name? Cindy, or something.

"Must have dozed off," MNBrian said. "I was having a weird dream."

He hadn't been sleeping much since becoming a moderator of the WritingPrompts subreddit. It must have caught up with him. So many posts to review, all about the same old topics.

MNBrian looked up at the clock on the wall. The hour hand pointed in the general direction of eleven.

He'd slept for three hours?

He turned to the woman. She must have seen the accusing expression on his face.

"I can explain," she said. "You'll never believe what happened to me."
