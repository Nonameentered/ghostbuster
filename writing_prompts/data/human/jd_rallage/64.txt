"-and that about wraps up your orientation," St. Peter said. "Any questions? No? In that case: Welcome to Heaven! Dinner is at six thirty. Make sure you're prompt. Dessert tonight is our famous quadruple chocolate fudge brownie, and it tends to go quickly."

The new souls began to leave, some flitting eagerly, some drifting slowly as if they couldn't quite believe this was happening to them. I lingered. I had a question.

"Hey, Pete," I said, edging up to the lectern.

St. Peter looked up. "Can I help you?"

"Yeah. Actually, Pete my man, what are the chances of getting a favour from the old man? If, say, I wanted to pop back down to old stomping grounds for one last night?"

St. Peter frowned. "You mean return to Earth? I'm afraid that's quite impossible. You are, after all, Dead."

"Yeah, but Pete, hear me out. It's a bit... quiet around here. Don't you remember what it was like back down there? I bet you tore it up with the ladies." I gave him a playful punch on the arm, but my incorporeal fist passed straight through him, and his frown deepened.

"You wish to return for a woman?"

"Yeah," I said. He was a bit slow on the up take, but he was getting there.

St. Peter pulled a file out of the pile on the lectern, and sheathed through the pages. His eyes widened impressively. "Which one?"

I laughed. "Nice one, Pete-y. Actually there wasn't one yet tonight, but I had high hopes for a blonde at the bar."

His eyes glazed and took on a far away look. "Ah yes. I see the one. Isn't she a bit young for you?"

I snorted. "Obviously you got less experience with the dames than I gave you credit for."

St. Peter raised an eyebrow. "Oh, really? Because it says here-" he tapped one of the pages, "-that it's been quite a while since you 'got lucky'. Two decades, in fact." He sneered.

Wow. And I thought Heaven was supposed to be the nice place. Still, as my old man told me before he skipped town on my ma and me: always take the high road. "But that's why one more night is so important. One more chance to make a memory before all this." I waved my hand in the general direction of Eternity.

"What about Alice?"

"Alice? Who the Hell is Alice?"

St. Peter smiled, as if I'd said something funny. "Alice Fletcher? She was your first girlfriend. No, nothing?"

A vague memory of a face threatened to rear up from where I'd buried it long ago in the depths of my mind. It was a pretty enough face, in the way that all faces are pretty when they're young, but I'd known many prettier since. "What about Alice?"

"If my notes are to be believed, and they always are, you moved onto Cindy before telling Alice of this change in your relationship."

Now Cindy I *did* remember. Hell, Cindy had done things that were hard to forget, even fifty years later. But I didn't like St. Peter's tone. It was getting a little prissy. "So?"

"Do you know what happened to Alice? No, of course you don't. Let me summarize. A string of abusive boyfriends after you, all of whom she tolerated because she couldn't bear the thought of having her heart crushed like that again. A kid before she was eighteen. Dropped out of school. Drugs. And two suicide attempts, one unsuccessful."

"Your point?" I said.

St. Peter sighed. "How about Hannah?"

"Which one?"

He smiled, but he didn't laugh. "The third one. The stock broker's wife."

"She knew what she was doing," I protested. All those suburban moms had known.

"But her husband didn't," he said. "Not until later. And after the divorce, the kids... well, let's just say a promising cancer researcher never made it to Harvard as she was supposed to, and your country won less gold medals in the last Olympics than they should have."

I took a step back. I didn't have to put up with this nonsense. This was Heaven, after all - wasn't it supposed to be happy? 

"Stop, we're not finished yet." His voice caught me in a net of words, and held me fast. "There are a lot of names on this list. Angela and Angelica, two Janes, and the 5th Hannah, to name but a few. Mr. Ives, you were a very busy man."

"What the Hell is your game?" I turned to go.

Behind me, St. Peter's voice said, "So close, Mr. Ives, but there's no 'What" about it. Hell *is* my game."

The walls of Heaven's orientation room melted away, and transformed into a bar. The bar. The place where I'd been sipping my fourth beer two hours earlier, before the heart attack, and eyeing up the leggy blonde at the bar.

I turned back to St. Peter but he'd disappeared. In his place was a short man in a pinstriped suit. Two eyes redder than coals burned under the brim of a bowler hat, and a mouthful of needle-like teeth smiled nastily. It was the same smile that the St. Peter had worn, just pointier.

He waved a hand towards the bar and the blonde. "Go right ahead, Mr. Ives."

I staggered forwards, throwing him an uncertain glance over my shoulder, but he'd already disappeared.

I stepped up to bar next to the woman. "Hey, what's a good lookin' girl like you doing in a bad old place like this?"

If she heard me, she gave no sign of it. Annoyed, I reached out to tap her shoulder, but she moved away at the last minute, slipping just beyond my fingers.

The noise of the bar suddenly burst into my ears, as if somebody had turned up the volume. I looked up, distracted from the woman for just a moment, and the bar looked back at me with a hundred faces, all of which I knew and some of which I remembered. Both Janes were there, and three of the five Hannahs.

Alice sat alone at a nearby table, drinking a strawberry daiquiri. 

"Alice?" As I approached, she stood and glided away.

That's how my last evening went on forever.
