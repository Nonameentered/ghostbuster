They have a saying here on Earth, that some of the natives follow in some of the remaining natural habitat: "Take only photos, leave only footprints."

I'd been bemused when I first saw it on a sign on one of my field trips, because it's a remarkably succinct summarization of the oath one swears upon joining the Extraplanetary Xenobiological Institute. Alerting an alien species, especially the only other sentient one we had ever encountered, to the presence of other life in the galaxy, was top of the list of no-no's.

But I'd taken another oath too, after fifteen years at Earth Station, one that began with the words "I, Megan, take thee, Andrew," and ended with "-until death do us part."

I suppose, if you want to argue technicalities, I had not made any explicit vow to "fly an advanced alien spacecraft into high Earth orbit to rescue you from certain death should you become stranded up there and thus prevent said parting". And if I'm honest, I don't know that I would have said it back then. Andrew was only supposed to be cover, after a string of accidental UFO sightings that had threatened to expose our presence here among the humans.

Well, I was going to blow that secrecy now. I fasted the seat restraints as my personal space runner finished its pre-launch checks. The systems check light came up green, and I pushed the clutch down, shifted into first, and began to accelerate gently upwards. This was going to be such an awkward conversation.

I'd just changed into second gear when the first call came in. My phone vibrated, and my heart skipped a beat. Andrew had given me that phone on my last birthday (or on the day in the Earth's solar cycle that I had picked to be that anniversary). Reality came back instantly. He was stranded in space. There was no way he could possibly contact me. Indeed, I'd only heard about his crew's accident via the national news.

No, the call was my boss at Earth Station, Dave (not his true name). That was going to be another awkward conversation, and also probably a career-ending one. I let it go to voicemail. His text came a few minutes later: "What's going on? CALL ME."

By the time I debated whether I should respond, and if so, what possible excuse I could give to explain my ship's highly illegal ascent into the atmosphere, we had got out of range of the cell phone towers. The signal icon dropped to nothing. I put the phone away.

It buzzed again, almost immediately.

The caller ID said "Studmuffin". The name Andrew had put for himself in my contacts when he'd given me the phone. The name I'd jokingly called him on our third date when he got a hole-in-one at mini-golf. That was two days after he'd told me that he'd always wanted to be an astronaut, and two years before we got married. Sometime between then and now he'd gone from a convenient cover story to an alien I'd risk changing a planet's history for.

The phone was still ringing in my hand, and I was looking at it in bewilderment. It was impossible that it could be ringing. For one thing, I was out of cell phone range, and for another Andrew had no ability to make calls from his space ship, even before it had malfunctioned.

I hit the green button to accept the call. "Andrew?"

"Hey, honey." There was a lot of static, but there was no mistaking that baritone. "How are you?"

"I'm- I'm fine. But-"

"You're probably wondering how I'm calling you? Did you see us on the news? Yeah, not a great situation we're in. But listen, it's not as bad as they're probably making it out to be. I need you to do something for me. Where are you now?"

"On my way to the supermarket," I said. "We were out of milk."

"I think the bottle in the fridge expired yesterday," he said. "But listen, I need you to turn around. I want you to drive to a private storage facility outside of town."

"Andrew, what's-"

"I'll explain on the way," he said. "I wouldn't be asking you to do this unless it was urgent, but, well, we're in a little bit of a sticky situation up here, Pickle." That was my nickname in his contacts.

"How is me going to some storage facility possibly going to help you fix a broken oxygen system in space?"

"Ah," he said. "Well, that's the rub. I'm afraid I haven't been completely honest with you, Pickle. You're actually going to find another spaceship there."

"Another spaceship," I repeated.

"Yes," he said. "It's... a little more advanced than the one I'm in now. And it might look a little... alien."

"Alien." A strange, cold feeling hit me in the pits of both my stomachs. I shifted my own space runner up another gear.

"And I know you don't have any idea how to fly a space ship," he continued, with what I could tell after all these years was forced cheerfulness, "but don't worry, I can walk you through it all over the phone."

My navigation system announced, "Leaving planetary atmosphere."

"What was that?" he asked. "Is there somebody else with you? I hate to be difficult right now, but this is something you need to keep to yourself if possible."

"Just the car GPS," I said. "So, where am I going?"

He gave me the address of the storage facility. "How long until you can get there?"

I looked at my navigation system's estimated arrival time to intercept his drifting rocket. "Thirty minutes," I said.

"Drive safe," he said. "But Megan... do hurry, please. The others crew members are starting to suffer from lack of oxygen." But not him, I noticed.

"I'll call you back when I get there," I said, and stamped on the accelerator. "Talk to you soon."

It was shaping up to be an extremely awkward conversation.
