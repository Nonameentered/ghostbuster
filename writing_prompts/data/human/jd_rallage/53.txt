It was the sort of bar you didn't go into if you were a God-fearing man. 

A sign on the door read 'No Shirt, No Shoes, No Immortality, No Entrance'. But Thor waved his hammer at me, and said, "He's with us," and the bouncer grunted and stepped aside to let me into the Ragnarok Arms.

A patina of smoke coated everything in the room - the stone floors, the ancient oak furniture, and the assortment of mounted heads hanging from the walls. One was from a deer, but the rest were an assortment of creatures, some humanoid, that I'd never seen before.

The bar fell silent when we entered, and I realized that fifty pairs of eyes were staring through the smoke at us. No, not at us. At me.

"Um, maybe I should get out of here," I hissed to my room mate, as a hulking fellow with a beard and an axe shifted in his seat.

"Nonsense," Thor scoffed. He looked around the room. "Evening, all. Andhrímnir, ales for the house. On me."

The tension, which had begun to coat the room almost as thickly as the smoke, disipated. Someone grunted. Another laughed. And then conversation and alcohol flowed freely in the room once more.

Loki slapped me on the back, and winked. "Ha, mortal, don't look so worried. The last human to come here only left with three broken ribs. The Ragnarok Arms is not as rough as it used to be."

The four of us - Thor, Loki, Magni, and I - sat down at a table. The barman came over and slammed four great tankards down on the table, with a force that would have crushed skulls.

"Thanks, Andhrímnir," Thor said. He raised one of the tankards. "Bottoms up, chaps."

Loki winked at me. All three of the gods threw back their heads and began to down the foamy ale.

I lifted the last tankard to my lips. It was so heavy that I had to use both arms. The ale was cool and yet fiery, burning as it went down my throat. As I drank, I felt the mug lighten in my hands until it felt like no more than a feather.

I lowered the empty tankard, and found all three gods staring at me, a curious expression on their lips.

"Well?" Thor said impatiently. He was always impatient, my room mate. I suppose that's why he always left our shared apartment in such a mess. "How do you feel?"

I nodded, tentatively. "Good," I said. "I think. But different, somehow."

Thor relaxed. Loki and Magni exchanged relieved smiles.

"What?" I said.

"You live," Magni said. "Thor said you were the one, but Loki and I weren't sure."

"What are you talking about?" I asked. "The one? We're just room mates. I found him on Craigslist."

"No mortal born man could have found that advert," Thor said. "Just as no mortal born man could have drunk the ale of the Gods and lived."

I could feel my body growing under my clothes. Muscles were expanding in places that I'd long ago given up on. The top button of my shirt popped off, and flew into one of the empty tankards.

"Welcome back," Loki said softly.

I looked around the bar in dismay. Either the smoke had cleared, or my vision had doubled, because the room leapt into focus. 

"What the Hell?" I said. "Look, thanks for the drink guys, but I think there's been a mistake. I'm Steve Black, from Springfield, Ohio. If it's all right with you, I think I'll head home."

I tried to stand, but my head swam.

"No," Thor said. He put a meaty hand on my shoulder and pressed me back down into my seat. I was too dizzy to resist. "You are not Steve Black. You are Halnir, a son of the Gods."

"Impossible," I said. The sleeve of my shirt ripped as a bicep grew through it. "My parents still live in Ohio."

"Your adopted parents," Thor said. He saw the look on my face and raised a hand. "There will be a time for questions later. Right now, you must listen. We have been searching for you for many years, Halnir. You see, we need you."

"Yes," Loki said, and his light hearted face had grown uncharacteristically sombre. "Only you can save Valhalla, Steve-Halnir Black."
