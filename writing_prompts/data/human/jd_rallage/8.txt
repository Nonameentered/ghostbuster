The snag with stories is that they have a story-teller, and, as we all know, you can trust nobody less that a weaver of fantasies. Except, perhaps, for a granter of them.

The gang had all heard the stories: of caves in the desert, of lamps and the entities captured inside them, of wishes gained and granted. That was why they were here, after all: Tiny Ted, looking for youth; Artemis, looking for revenge; and me, looking for redemption.

There had been others, of course, over the decades, but it had been a long and dispiriting search. Fool's errands do not tend to attract well-adjusted people, or if they do, they never stick around for too long. A fling becomes a spouse, a spouse becomes a family, and children need a parent who can put food on the table, not one who spends their days poring over old maps and ancient texts.

But after all those years, it seemed like we had finally found it - the fabled cave of Aladdin, buried by the sands of time. There had been traps, some we had known about, others unrecorded. That is why the gang was down to just three of us, standing in the treasure room, staring at the lamp. The legendary lamp.

The trouble with legends is that they are old. Have you ever wondered why? Why, if they are true, nobody outside of Hollywood has been greedy enough to remake them for the modern era?

Artemis reached for the lamp. Tiny Ted caught her hand, with surprising speed for one so old.

"No," he said, "I've paid for this expedition. I go first."

He touched the old lamp, which the centuries had left untarnished. Or perhaps that was just the dry desert air.

Whispers filled the cavern. Air whipped around us. The lamp began to shake on the pedestal. Something materialized in the air.

No, not something. Some*one*. Humanoid, but inhuman. Old, but eternal. All-powerful, and yet forever chained to its prison.

"Who disturbs my rest?" it said, with a voice that spoke from all around us, whipping our hair around us and flinging dust into our eyes. "And what do you want?"

"My name is Theodore Gerald Heironymous," said Tiny Ted. Then the old bastard's eyes grew crafty. He leaned on his cane, and pulled a piece of paper out of his pocket. "I have here a contract, drawn up by my lawyers, that is free of loopholes, and states in explicit terms the contents of three wishes to be granted to me."

Clever, I thought. We had spent many late evenings discussing what each of us would ask for, and how to prevent a djinn from twisting our words if we ever found one. But trust Tiny Ted to actually have his wishes drawn up by a lawyer. I supposed that one did not become a titan of industry without having plans within plans.

But there was a snort from the entity. I thought it sounded amused. A gust of wind caught the piece of paper, and tore it up and away.

"Oh, mortal," it sighed. "Wishes cannot be bound, like a djinn. You cannot bottle desire, or write one out like a business contract. No wishes are ephemeral, deep..." the genie paused,"...dark.

"Things like..." and the djinn's form swirled around Tiny Ted, "...lust."

The djinn's hooded eyes swiveled to where Artemis stood - beautiful, desirable, unobtainable Artemis. Suddenly she stood in a white dress and a lace veil, with a ring on the fourth finger of her left hand.

She stared down at herself in shock, and then over at Tiny Ted in disgust. "You-"

"Now wait a second," Ted said. "I've still got another two wishes left-"

"Oh no," the djinn said. "One wish. Where would be the fun in three?"

It turned to Artemis, who had ripped off the wedding veil, and was now trying to remove the ring from her finger. "And as for you, child... revenge..."

It looked back at Tiny Ted, who suddenly clutched at his throat, gasping for air. I ran over to him, but there was nothing I could do except hold him as he died.

"No," Artemis shouted next to me. "No, this wasn't what I wanted. I mean, I wanted revenge, but not on him. And I did not want anyone to die."

"Oh, but it was your wish," the djinn said. "Not always this particular man, I'll grant you. But if you humans are good at anything, it is short-term thinking. And did you never truly desire death? In those moments of falling asleep, when the conscious rational mind lets go, did you never once imagine what death might be like for that other man who wronged you?"

"Yes, but-"

"It is strange, where our minds go," the djinn observed. "How once a thought has cut it's channel into the mind, other thoughts begin to flow between those same banks."

And it turned its head to me.

"You need grant me no wish," I said quickly. I tried to blank my mind, to wish of nothing. But I had spent my life dreaming of wishes. Have you ever tried not to think of a white elephant, when your life has been spent in the pursuit of a herd of them? Everything I had ever thought wonderful seemed suddenly terrible. "You're are a myth, genie. Stay that way. Let me go."

"The problem with myths is that they have a moral," the genie said. "And morals, as we all know, require somebody to be made an example of. But... how interesting... very well. To you, after a lifetime spent searching for the easy solution, I grant your wish... nothing at all."
