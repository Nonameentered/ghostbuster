The Mini Cooper died slowly, but painfully. The cylinders sputtered out one after another, and with a final gurgle, the engine fell silent. The little car's momentum carried it on down the dirt road, but physics has a certain inevitability. We began to slow, from a painfully bumpy 60, to a dreadfully sedate 30, and then to a trundle.

And then we stopped, and sat on the lonely road in a quietness so complete that we could hear every noise that the still night didn't make.

There was a howl in the distance.

Beside me, Kathy said, "Oh, God," and her fingers clenched the car door desperately, as if it could shield her from night beyond. The color that had been returning to her face had disappeared once more.

I tried the key in the ignition. The starter motor wheezed pathetically, but the rest of the car didn't respond.

The howl sounded again, closer this time.

I looked in the rear view mirror. The winding road behind us was bathed in white moonlight. The Mini's tracks stretched back to the lake where we'd abandoned our tent, our campfire ghost stories, and our sneering skepticism. There was no other sign of life on the road, or in the deserted wilderness around us. Nobody else was rational enough to scoff at the legends, and camp at the haunted lake on full moon. 

We were alone out here. Almost.

From the bushes beside the road came a growl. It started low and quiet, before rising into a menacing snarl that shook the car, and then faded in a throaty snicker.

Kathy's hand reached out to touch me, as if somehow I'd be able to protect her.

A tree swayed slightly, as if something massive had pushed passed it. For just a moment, I thought I saw two pricks of red light burning holes in the shadow of the forest.

I fumbled with the ignition, hands shaking so badly that I could barely turn the key. My wet fingers slid across the plastic, unable to get a hold of it.

Kathy's lips were twitching, mumbling a half-remembered prayer. I'd never heard her pray before. She'd stopped going to church long before I met her.

I managed to turn the key, and the engine sputtered uselessly. But just as it began to fade, something, some spark of life, caught hold of the petrol, and the little motor roared back.

I stuck it in first, and slammed my foot onto the accelerator.

The car lurched forwards reluctantly. I swear it had never picked up speed so slowly before.

Something large, hairy, and ravenous, leapt out onto the spot where the car had been just a moment before. 

And then the car shot forwards. Dust billowed up from the tires as they skidded on the dry road, and obscured my view in the mirror. As we hurtled off into the night, I thought I saw two red eyes gaze malevolently after us from the cloud of dirt. They met my gaze, just for a moment, and then disappeared.

We didn't go camping again for a long time after that, and never down by the lake. But sometimes, when there's a full moon and I can't sleep, I peer out from the bars on the windows of our house. And I will swear on everything Holy that one night, two red eyes stared back at me from the shadows.
