"Oh, fuck off," God growled.

Lucifer shrugged. "I didn't bring it up." He appealed to the table for support, and didn't seem to phased by the lack of reaction. "Did I bring this up? No, I didn't. But you had to start with that snide little jibe about violins, and-"

"Go to Hell," God said. "I mean that literally. Why are even here? It's not like your a proper deity."

"I have my devotees," Satan said. "Remind me again who they used to worship. Oh, right..."

The Buddha sighed. "Sorry about all this," he said to Anna. "Family gatherings. You know how they can get."

He seemed to realize what he'd said, and looked mortified. "Oh bugger. How insensitive of me. That's at least two years as an ant."

"Good," Anna said.

"It could be worse," Ganesha said. "Back when we had the Greek lot... Well, let's just say it's more complicated when your dad turned your mum into a cow, raped her, and then your step mom spent the rest of your life trying to kill you. How are supposed to enjoy the chocolate cake when it could be laced with arsenic? And a cow, really?"

"Is this supposed to make me feel better?" Anna said.

"Well..." the Buddha hesitated. "We hope so. I mean, things got a little out of hand back there, to be sure, but we meant well."

"I blame Godstagram, personally," Shiva said. "Nowadays it's all about one-upping your frenemies."

"And the comments some people leave..." God said. He glowered at Lucifer, and muttered, "Trolls."

"I heard that-"

"Enough," Anna screamed, and almost fell backwards in surprise at how loud her voice was. It richoched down the infinite hall, down the endless table of deities major and minor. There was no echo.

A silence fell. Into it, she said, "I thought you brought me here to apologize. Not to bicker and pass the buck."

Another silence.

Finally the Buddha said, "We are sorry. Truly."

There was a murmur of agreement.

"We shouldn't burned down your house," Shiva said.

"Or had your dog crushed by a herd of elephants," said Ganesha.

"Or murdered your entire family to test your devotion," God said.

"I told you you can't do that sort of stuff these days," Lucifer said. "I said, 'Its the twenty-first century, there are rules laws now-'"

Shiva punched him on the shoulder and said to Anna, "We are sorry. We took things too far. But you have to understand just how rare you are. With a heart like yours, a truly pure soul, why, we we're all desperate to get you. In today's world, souls like yours are one in a couple of billion."

Anna stared down at her plate, and tried to fight back tears of rage. It wasn't enough. And the chicken was undercooked. She supposed that salmonella wasn't a problem if you were immortal.

"No," she said.

"No?"

"I don't accept your apology. My five year old can-" she caught herself, " could apologize better than that."

She stood up. "You all need to be stopped. I'm going to go back and fix this. Start my own religion, one of truth and justice and goodness, and make all of you obsolete."

The gods watched her go. After the huge doors of the infinite hall had changed shut behind her, God sighed.

"I remember those days," he said.

"The naivite," Lucifer said, patting his arm.

Ganesha added, "Back when anything seemed possible. We thought we could change the world. What happened to us?."

"We did change it," the Buddha said sadly. "But it changed us, too."

Lucifer stared at the door thoughtfully, "Maybe she'll be different."
