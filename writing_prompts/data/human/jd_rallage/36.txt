Chunks of Cthulhu's form were blown back through portal, splattering the Eldritch Plane like great gobs of apricot jam.

The shimmering blobs coated the landscape, and Zruila's stunned face, before slowly dissolving into the starlight and ether that had formed them.

There was a moment of eternal silence that lasted all of two seconds.

A hail of gunfire and explosions sounded from the other side of the portal.

"Shit," Zruila said. She threw herself to the ground, narrowly avoiding a large bolt of pure energy that passed through the spot where her head had been, and exploded two hundred behind her. The force of the blast rolled her across the ground, and the mountain of pure diamond that had been there a moment before was nothing but a huge crater.

"Shit," Zruila said again.

More firing was coming and explosions were peppering the ground like rain drops in a thunderstorm. Zruila picked herself up and sprinted through them like a a lightning bolt, putting as much space between herself and the portal as possible.

There was no word in the mortal tongue for the place where They lived, so let us call it the City. Zruila arrived at the City in the space of four heartbeats, or the time it takes for the soul of a dying star to cross the universe.

In the Council's chambers, the Eldest regarded her severely. "Cthulhu cannot be killed by metal or flesh."

"Not by either," Zruila said, "but by pure energy."

The Eldest laughed. "Dear Zruila, such power is beyond the ken of mortal men."

Later, Zruila said, "The Eldest are almost as foolish as Cthulhu was."

Qgp, Eater of Galaxies, nursed his pint and nodded sourly. "I can feel portal. It is still open. Even now, the humans prepare to come through."

"They will bring with them fire and dust and the Light that Darkens," said Brugko, He Who Sees With A Thousand Eyes. "And they will leave behind Death Herself."

"Death?" Zruila whispered. "Then they will destroy us all."

Silence descended upon the trio as they sat at the bar.

Then Brugko said, "There are other futures. If the portal can be closed..."

Qgp said, "We cannot do that from here."

"We must travel," Zruila said, "to the World of Men."
