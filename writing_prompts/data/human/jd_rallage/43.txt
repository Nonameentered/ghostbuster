We'd only met each other once, in a little waterfront bar in Miami that disappeared a while back.

She was drinking a pina colada, and I was drinking in her. We knew immediately who the other was, knew that they were on the other team, and knew that neither of us cared. The next morning, after breakfast, we took a strip of pictures in a photo booth, just for a laugh. That evening, a man died who wasn't supposed to die, and I never saw her in person again.

I'd learned an important lesson that day, which is that you can't trust anyone in this business. That sort of attitude carries you far in this world, and in my case it carried me to the top. I suppose I had her to thank for that.

I followed her career with the dispassionate interest that you might allot to a former colleague, and tried to pretend that it was nothing more than professional courtesy. She did well, better than most of her team mates did after the glory days of the '80s. Occasionally, when I was stuck in a lonely hotel room in a distant country, I pulled out the photo booth picture that I carried in my wallet and stared at the blue eyes framed by hair that wasn't really blonde.

I carried that same picture in my hand today, as I looked around Time Square and tried to spot her face among the throng of Christmas Eve shoppers. Word had reached me that she'd be here this evening. I only hoped that her face hadn't changed to much. In my pocket, my hand stroked the smooth plastic tube of a syringe.

The Time Square screens cast a rainbow of light over a thousand faces. An advertisement for cologne changed into a picture of a man, but I wasn't paying much attention. I was too busy looking for her. An unusually hopeful part of my brain suggested that maybe her plans had changed. And besides, there were too many people here to single out just one.

And then I noticed people staring at me. They looked at my face in surprise, then in horror, and pointed up at the screens. I followed their fingers up, and met my own gaze looking down at me.

It was an old picture of me, taken in a photo booth. My hair had thinned since then, and it was silver in places that used to be black. There were more lines in my face, and deeper valleys under my eyes. The face of the woman next to me had been blurred out.

The picture hadn't aged well either. It had been creased in places, and the edges were battered as if it had been carried around in a handbag for many years.

Below the picture were the words, "This man is the world's best assassin. He is in Time Square tonight."

Cameras came up, and flashes pinned me in the center of a thick circle of people. I tried to throw up my hands to shield my face, but it was too late. By midnight, I would be all over social media, and by morning I would be on every cable news channel. It would be the last Christmas anyone would ever want to hire me again.

Two cops were coming towards me, but I wasn't looking at them. I'd seen a face in the crowd, a face I recognized. She caught my eye for a second, and winked at me, and then she was gone.
