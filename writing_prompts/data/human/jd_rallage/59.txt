The driver of internal conflict, as it currently stands, is that she is attracted to the nobleman, but she detests everything that he represents (i.e. the oppressive Empire). 

The **false climax** is her attempts to get out of the blackmail by herself. Unfortunately everything she tries just gets her more trapped.

The **internal climax** is when she puts aside her own best interests to prevent the death of the love interest, overcoming some of her hatred for the Empire.

The **external climax** is defeating the blackmailer (who's also trying to rip apart the Empire). However, this was only possible because her sacrifice in the *internal climax* broke some of the blackmailer's power over her.

Thanks for keeping up this series, you've made me realize a few areas to improve on (Again!!!). In particular I need to better show the main character's internal growth as her views on the Empire change, from "it's 110% bad" to "it's not always so terrible".
