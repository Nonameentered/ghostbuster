Well, if I'm honest, I would say this is one of my pulp-ier and less "literary" stories, in-so-far as I have any of the latter.

When I do use literary devices, I try to limit how cliched they are. Obviously, when you're quickly writing a response to a prompt here, you're not writing Pulitzer Prize worthy similes, but you can catch the first thing that comes to mind (which, for me, is usually a cliche), and replace it with something a bit more unique and interesting.

For example, the rescuer's face is "paper-white". I had originally thought about calling it bloodless, but I thought that was both (1) too cliched, and (2) a bit too on the nose (although you could also argue that its a good clue), since I never explicitly state that this person is a vampire.

One thing I try to do in my writing is be a little vague. Readers tend to enjoy not having *everything* spelled out for them immediately. For example, I don't tell you that this is a story about Batman until a third of the way in, although there are clues sooner (e.g. I mention a former fear of bats in sentence 1).

I do try to put clues in for the reader to figure things out like that in my stories. E.g. even if you had no idea that this was a story about vampires, you might start to guess that as you read about Van Helsing, turning into a bat, etc. I see this as related to the concept of "Chekhov's Gun" (if you see a gun in Act 1, it should go off in the final act). For example, if I wrote a longer story with loads of obvious vampire-related symbolism and memes in this opening scene, and then *none of the rest of the story* had any vampires or anything remotely vampire-related, you as the reader would feel a little duped.

And putting in these vague clues makes the reader start asking themselves questions as they read. Then they want to read on to answer those questions, which helps to keep the story going.

Hope that helps!
