"All must submit to the will of the supreme Kwall." 

The human ambassador intoned the ritual farewell in its own alien language. It's translator unit belched out a long, wet gurgle that would have impressed a fraternity sophomore, and then abruptly fell silent.

Senator [Unknown Word. Translator's note: phrase is roughly equivalent to the-sound-of-large-raindrops-in-a-boggy-puddle] L'restika remained completely motionless for several minutes until the proper period of respect had been shown to Kwall, signifying the Supreme Being's power to stop even the actions of the universe. She noted that the human ambassador's eyes blinked once, towards the end of the Moment Without Motion, and she fought to control the anger that rose up at the slight.

Back home, you'd have been thrown in the clink for such a slight against Kwall (may His power reign over all Creation, she intoned silently to herself). But humans were a strangely twitchy species, and after three days of tough negotiations, Reggie knew that the ambassador had not meant the insult. So she waved a tentacle towards the door, and the ambassador scuttled towards it, relief plainly evident on its peculiar pink face. It had completed its mission to the Galactic Council without incident, delivered a parting "gift" (this was apparently a human tradition), and now it would begin the two light-year journey back to its homeworld with the good news that a trade treaty had been tentatively negotiated (even though it had been outmaneuvered by the Senator on every issue).

Alone in her chambers, Senator L'restika relaxed. Being your quadrant's representative on the High Galactic council wasn't easy. Every day was brought a constant stream of supplicants from your constituency of the galaxy, each with their own little problem which they wanted you to fix. This would have been bad enough by itself, even if each complainant hadn't belonged to a completely separate species with its own bizarre customs. The humans insisted on these bizarre gifts, but struggled with Stillness, and downright refused the prolonged physical contact that was a key part of negotiations on the Senator's home planet. No, galactic power was not all it was cracked up to be. How the hell did Kwall manage it?

She caught herself in the blasphemy and began to initiate another Moment to purify herself. Forgive me, Kw-

"Me-ow."

The sound was high, discordant, alien. The Senator's eyes sprang open like backwards bear traps, and settled on the crate that the human ambassador had left behind.

The crate shook slightly, defiling the Moment even further. 

"Meow." To the Senator, used to the soft gurgle of sounds on a swampier planet, it was worse than a whole classroom of nails on the chalkboard.

"Silence in the presence of Kwall (may He control all)," the Senator said. She could see something squirming around in the crate. Those bloody humans had left her something alive! Hadn't they read the Council's rulebook?

The crate moved again. Anxious to avoid a repeat of the awful noise, the Senator fumbled with the latch to let the creature out in the vain hope that freedom might make it silent.

Something small, furry, and unbearably ugly staggered out of the crate. The Senator regarded it in horror. Was this a juvenile human? It didn't look completely like the ambassador, but it did have the same number of eyes and limbs. Perhaps it was a larval form.

The Thing looked blearily around the Senator's steamy quarters, with the nonchalent curosity of the unwelcome stranger who is quite prepared to make themselves completely at home.

The Moment had been thoroughly desecrated by now. The Senator would have to spend hours in devotion tonight to make things right with the Supreme Being. Angrily, she said, "Computer, what in Kwall's name is this little human doing?"

An artificial voice replied, "Correction, Senator. This does not appear to be a human."

Not a human? "Then what is it?" Had Kwall sent a demon to punish her? Had she displeased Him in some way? But she had always been completely devout, always accepting that He had control over all his Creation.

The computer was silent for a while, apparently searching it's data stores for a match. 

"It appears," it said finally, "to be a cat." The word had no translation to the Senator's own language, so the computer said it in the human tongue. It was a harsh, cruel word. "Might I remind the Senator that the Council's rulebook has strict prohibitions against the interplanetary transport of living-"

"I know the rules," the Senator muttered. "I didn't bring the damn thing. It was a 'gift' from the human delegation."

"Most peculiar," the computer said. "Upon further searching, I have detected that this is, in fact, a juvenile cat. The form is generlly known as a kitten."

The word was also unpleasant, but not as bad as cat.

"And is this a common action among humans? Leaving a cat as a 'gift'?" The Thing was now strutting around the floor of the Senator's quarters like it owned the place. 

"Unclear," the computer said. "I do not have much data on the matter, although what I possess suggest that foodstuffs called wine and chocolate are more common."

"Why couldn't they have left me some of those?" the Senator grumbled.

"Oh, I couldn't recommend that," the computer said. "Preliminary scans of their chemical make-up suggest that both substances would be toxic to your biology, Senator."

The Senator had no good answer to that, so instead she glared at the Thing. The creature was now occupied in trying - and failing - to catch its own tail. It seemed to have even less sentience than the humans. Perhaps that was why they kept these 'kittens', to make themselves feel better about their own limited intelligence.

She cursed inwardly, and then made a mental note to add another hour of stillness to her devotion to Kwall later. Had the humans done this out of spite? Was this some unusual punishment because she'd refused to allow them a free trade zone outside their own system? Because she'd insisted they were not exempt from the 10% duty that went to the Church of Kwall? Did they not realize that things had to be that way, because Kwall controlled all and to not pay the tax would be against the very laws of nature themselves?

"Damn," she muttered.

The kitten suddenly froze, and for a moment the Senator's heart rejoiced. Perhaps this creature did understand the importance of Stillness after all-

The kitten pounced onto an invisible enemy six inches away, and then immediately forgot its kill and gamboled away across the spotless metal floor.

"Stop," the Senator gurgled in desperation. "In Kwall's name, I command you to stop! Oh, Kwall, Lord of All, exert your control over this most annoying of your creations.

To her surprise, the kitten obeyed, turning its head towards to look at her for the first time. The Senator realized that this surprised her. She had half expected that the demonic little creature would continue to torment her. She had not had faith in Kwall. That had to be at least ten hours of further Devotion.

The Senator found herself looking into two eyes that were both tiny and yet impossibly large at the same time. "Demon," she muttered, but found that she didn't really believe it.

The creature padded a few steps closer and stood looking at her. Its tail twitched from side to side. It was a gesture that the Senator would not have been able to stand any other creature in the galaxy, but in this little bundle of ugliness it was oddly endearing.

Slowly, the kitten padded forwards, until it was at the base of the Senator's bulk. It leaned its little body against her, and began to rub against her form. Senator L'restika felt a peculiar joy wash over her, and she reached to caress the creature back.

Beneath the Senator's tentacles, the kitten began to purr happily. It was an alien sound, but it was not unpleasant.
