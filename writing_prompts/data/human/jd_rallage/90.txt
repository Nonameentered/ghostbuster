/u/MissJLynnRose I enjoyed reading this and thought it was a good first chapter, with some good conflict and character development.

I don't usually read much romance (or horror - I'm not sure which of those directions this is going), so take my comments with a grain of salt, but here are some things I noticed.

Your grammar, spelling, and punctuation are off in a few places. Obviously, that's not a huge problem for a first draft, but definitely something you should tidy up in revision.

The table of five men. They all blended into one person for me, and it was hard to tell which one of them was which. Might be nice to add some more characterization, particularly for whichever one is the main man so that he stands out from the others.

Then when you get to the kidnapping, she recognizes the man from the VIP booth. But which of the five? You talked about about several of the men when they were in the club. Again, this is where characterization of them as individuals would help.

Speaking of the kidnapping, it was a little too much of a surprise. Have you heard of Chekhov's gun? If you show a loaded gun in the first act, it needs to go off at the end? The trouble here is you never introduced a the kidnapping 'gun' in the first act. I don't want to prescribe a solution, but you could try to add in some foreshadowing so that the reader goes "Oh, of course she's getting kidnapped, I should have seen that coming", rather than "She's being kidnapped?! Where the hell did that come from?" Again, I don't want to prescribe a way to do this, but as an example of what I mean, you could move her inner dialogue about her brother closer to the start of the chapter. Maybe she looks around the club and thinks darkly that this is the kind of place her brother would come to. Or maybe she has had the feeling that somebody is following her for the past few days.

Again, it was a good story, and I hope this critique helps if you decide to carry it on, which you should!
