Robert opened his eyes.

The cornfield had become a tree. 

Specifically, it had become a tree that was now in the crumpled embrace of the Mercedes's bonnet. He blinked and became aware that there were more trees beyond it, a whole forest of the damn things.

“Ooh, he moved,” the little voice said. “Do mortals come back to life after they die?”

“He’s not dead, fool,” growled another voice, much deeper. Robert thought of bears and wolves and other much worse things. “Stop zooming around and help the man.”

Robert craned his neck to look in the direction of the first, squeakier speaker. It was the same voice that had come on over the GPS. A child’s voice. The movement was agonizing, and for a moment he thought the pain was making him hallucinate. But he blinked again, and the hallucination persisted.

A small figure, about three feet tall, hovered above the passenger seat. It had eyes that twinkled with the light of distant stars, a crooked grin that seemed to have been superglued to its lips, and on its back were a pair of translucent wings that fluttered so fast they hummed.

Robert leapt sideways into the driver side door and began fumbling desperately for the handle. Before he could find it, the door, buckled by the impact, swung open and Robert pitched out onto the damp forest floor.

He came up with a mouthful of pine needles and swear words, and began to hobble away through the undergrowth. His panicked mind became distantly aware of a pain in his left ankle. Then the offending limb, disobeying the commands of his mind, decided to latch onto to a raised root and Robert had his second encounter with the ground. The forest loam was much blacker this time.

He regained consciousness to the sensation of droplets of water being flicked against his face. He lay on the ground with his eyes closed, as the pain of a thousand bruises descended on him all at once.

“You know,” the deep growl said, “I thought he'd be taller.”

“And better looking,” the high voice of the winged thing said. “‘e looked much more ‘andsome in that photo. I do ‘ope She doesn't throw one of her fits.”

“He just moved,” said the growl.

“Don't think so,” the squeak said glumly. “Pretty sure he's a goner this time. I think we killed 'im. Twice. Didn't know you could do that to a Mortal.”

“Shut up,” the growl said, and something unpleasantly cool stuck itself in Robert’s ear.

Robert yelled and thrashed. His hand connected with something small and soft and warm, which promptly chomped down on his finger.

The small winged creature was staring at him in bemused horror, hand frozen in mid-flick above a clam shell of perfectly clear water. A small animal was latched onto Robert's finger, growling like a wolf. It was a rabbit.

“Stop it,” the winged creature snapped. “Stop that now, or She’ll put you in tonight's stew.”

The rabbit let go of Robert and dropped back. Blood welled up on Robert's finger, but he barely felt it against the backdrop of pain that already coursed through him.

He dropped back to the ground and closed his eyes. Aloud he said, “I must be dead.”

“Probably,” the winged creature said.

“You're not” the rabbit said simultaneously.

Robert lay there and said nothing.

After a moment the rabbit cleared its throat. It sounded like a dragon. “Mr Harris. *She* would like to see you.”

“And I'd like to wake up,” Robert said. “Any time about… now.”

The forest floor remained cold against his back, the damp moss beginning to leach into his shirt. It had cost five hundred dollars, and he just knew that the moss stains wouldn't come out.

“Look 'ere, mister,” the winged creature said. Robert felt the hum of its wings as it flew closer. “It ain't that simple. Either you’re dead, in which case please tell us so we can fetch another lawyer, or get up and get moving.”

“You want a lawyer?” Robert said, his eyes snapping open.

“Yes,” the creature said.

“You? But… but… but what are you?”

The rabbit growled, “I do hope he's a bit more eloquent when he's defending the Realm.”

A lawyer. Robert clung to this familiar anchor in the rising tide of insanity that threatened to submerge him.

“A lawyer,” he said. “How do you know I’m a lawyer?”

The creature reached into a pocket and withdrew a folded piece of paper. It shook it out, and Robert saw a familiar page from the regional magazine. He recognized the page. It had his face on it. Robert distant remembered telling his secretary to give the reporter ten minutes. They'd asked a few questions and taken a few pictures. The publicity might even have been good for business, but the queue of clients was already so long that he wasn’t sure. You didn’t really need fame when you had notoriety.

“It says here you’re the best lawyer in the mortal realm,” the rabbit said skeptically.

They’re just potential clients, Robert thought. Pretend that they’re just clients. I mean, this is just a talking rabbit and a flying child. You’ve had the most dangerous men in the country sitting in your office before, and you didn’t even break a sweat.

“Some people put stock in rankings, gentlemen,” he said smoothly. Just clients. “Not me. I say, look at results not rankings. I’ve never lost a case, gentlemen.”

“Hrmph,” the rabbit grunted.

“We’d better take you to Her,” the creature said. “She don’t like to be kept waiting.”

Robert pulled himself to his feet and almost fell. Something was definitely wrong with his ankle. “Might I inquire who we’re referring to?”

They looked at him like he was stupid. Eventually the rabbit said, “Only the bloody Queen.” It shook its head and mouthed something that sounded suspiciously like, “Daft lawyer.”

A Queen. There were no queens around here, but then there were no talking rabbits or fairys, if that’s what the flying thing was. 

“C’mon,” the fairy said. “Better get moving. You don’t want to know what she did to the last mortal who displeased her.”

With the last shred of dignity that he could muster, Robert said, “I’ll need my briefcase. It’s on the back seat of the car.” Then he gave in, and added, “And get me a stick to lean on, please. I think I’ve twisted my ankle.”
