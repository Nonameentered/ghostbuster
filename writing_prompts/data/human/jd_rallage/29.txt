*Not very long ago, in a galaxy suspiciously similar to our own...*

There's a gray waiting room outside the Oval Office, and on gray Washington mornings gray cars pull into the White House driveway and deposit gray suited men into the little room where they wait with gray faces as the clock slowly ticks away everyone's lives.

Occasionally, the thick wooden door will open, and another gray suited man will walk into the Oval Office, where he will shake the President's hand with the warm, reassuring grip that extends all the way up his arm to the thousand dollar smile that is painfully out of place in the gray face. This man has a name - they all do - but it's not important. We shall call him Gray.

"Mr. Gray," the President says, returning Gray's handshake and gesturing to one of the couches, upholstered in a risque velvet that is almost, but not quite, eggshell.

Gray sits, and the President sits opposite him. One does not hold a meeting with men like Mr Gray from behind the President's desk.

"Mr. President," Gray says, in a soft voice that is not quite flat, "we have a problem."

The President smiles understandingly. The men in gray suits always have problems. That is why they come.

"We thought we had them cornered when we nailed that last cell," Gray says, confident now that he has a receptive ear. "We thought we'd got the leader. But apparently some of them escaped."

He pushes a plain grey folder across the coffee table towards the President. It is not stamped with the words "Top Secret" or "Classified". They don't make stamps for this sort of thing.

The President reads the single sheet of paper inside without comment. When he is done, he says carefully, "Your masters must be displeased."

For the first time, a flicker of emotion betrays itself on Gray's face. "They're chafing for blood, sir. We're bleeding revenue."

"You know that Congress is working on a bill-" the President begins, but Gray guffaws loudly before realizing just who he's interrupted.

"Congress will do as they're told," he says, a note of apology in his voice. "Sure, there's a few troublemakers, but not enough to have an impact. No, Mr. President, this is more urgent. We must hunt down these new uprisings. We must stop the rot before it destroys us all."

The President says nothing for a long while, but just stares out into the Rose Garden. Gray waits with impatience almost as poorly concealed as a teenager's acne. Finally, the President nods.

Beaming, or perhaps smirking (it's hard to tell with these men), Gray gets up, and goes back out the door to the little waiting room. The President's secretary peers in. "Shall I send in the next one, sir?"

The President shakes his head. "Not yet. Clear my schedule for ten minutes. There's something I have to do."

When he is alone in the Oval Office, he opens up his computer and goes to the web browser. Then, double checking that he is alone, he goes to the browser add-ons, and activates one with a red icon with the letters "ABP". A notification pops up: "Ads and Trackers blocked."

In an encrypted messaging app, he begins to type. 

*This is your leader. We have a problem...*
