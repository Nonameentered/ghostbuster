I should have known better. After all, it *was* an independent coffee shop, replete with a menagerie of different mugs and a pony-tailed hipster at the helm of the espresso machine.

His face lit up as the doorbell tinkled my entrance into the coffee shop.

"Jane! You're early. I'll have your cappuccino ready in a jif." His hands became a blur at the machine.

I frowned. How did he know my name, and that I only drank cappuccinos?

I stepped up to the counter and glanced at his name tag. "Adam, could you help me? I'm looking for somebody called Jane Kay."

He gave me a funny glance. "Very funny."

"What do you mean?"

He slid the cappuccino up onto the bar. "Aren't you *Mrs Fletcher* since Sunday?"

I tried to see the silver lining. A case of mistaken identity. I had come to this little town to collect on the debts of one Jane Kay, and apparently we looked similar enough that people thought I was her.

But inside, my stomach began to writhe.

The doorbell tinkled again, and a man walked into the shop. He was tall and handsome, my type exactly, and his eyes smouldered when he saw me.

"Hey, honey," he said, striding over and planting a kiss on my lips that almost made me wilt. "I didn't expect to find you here before me."

His eyes looked down at me happily, in a way no man's eyes ever had before. 

The doorbell rang a third time. I didn't want to look. I already knew who it was going to be. But I forced myself to turn my eyes towards the door.

I saw myself walk into the coffee shop.
