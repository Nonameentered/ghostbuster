"The doctor will see you now."

Dr. Lorraine Fonda heard her secretary's announcement, saw the clean, white door open, and watched as the man walked into her office.

There was something a little off about him, but that wasn't uncommon in a psychologist's patients. And he wasn't her usual type of patient. Far too normal. Still, he'd become one of her favourites. He was courteous to a fault, not to mention devilishly good looking. 

He lay down on the couch - Dr. Fonda was a big proponent of her patients on couches - and smiled at her with those perfect white teeth that were more reflective than most mirrors.

"How has your week been, Kyle?" she asked.

"Great, thanks doc," he said.

She knew he was lying. His shield was up, as it was every time he walked into her clinic, and each time she broke it down a little further. She was good at that - breaking down shields - that was how she'd been able to bring peace and understanding to so many people.

"Is that so, Kyle? Why don't you tell me about it?"

"Just a standard week," he said. "Work, eat, sleep. Repeat. You know."

Dr. Fonda knew, although she would never have admitted it to a patient. So instead she just nodded sympathetically. "And that thing we talked about last time?"

"Oh, that's been fine," he said, a little too quickly.

"No more nightmares?"

"No, none. I think I spoke too soon last time. Really, they're nothing. Just a rough week."

She saw him shift slightly on the couch, taking the weight of his left shoulder. It reminded her of another shoulder she'd dealt with that week, one belonging to a much less malleable man. Assuming that Adamantium Man was even human...

"Doc?"

She snapped back to her patient. "I'm so sorry, Kyle, I drifted off for a moment there."

"Busy week for you too, huh?"

Yes, you could say that. A year's planning down the drain. What was the point of getting the mayor on your couch, spilling the city's weaknesses into your confidence, if that Adamantium Asshole (as she preferred to call him) was going to swoop in at the last moment?

Still, she'd at least hit him in the shoulder with a bazooka. Even he had to have felt that.

"Maybe I should come back," he said softly.

Dr. Fonda got a grip on herself, and forced her mind to concentrate on Kyle. "No, no. Let's carry on. Your recovery is what matters here. What about your progress making friends? Any luck?"

He hesitated. "One, actually."

She nodded supportively. "That's great, Kyle. You've been cutting back on work to make more time for socializing."

"Well... not quite. I met him on the job."

"At the metal factory?" She'd never quite understood how a metal worker managed to pay the fees she charged, but he did, in full, on time, which was better than many of her patients.

"No- I mean, yes."

Another lie. She pursed her lips disapprovingly, letting him know she knew. "No and yes? Who is this paradoxical person?"

"Just a mate," Kyle said. "He, er, he works at the Central Bank."

The name made her cold. The Central Bank. The same Bank she would have robbed, if Asshole Man hadn't shown his masked face. He must be ugly as sin. Why else would he wear a mask? And then he'd saved a security guard's life into the bargain.

"And how did you meet?"

Kyle hesitated. She could tell he was on the verge of letting go of the shield, of finally letting her in. 

He said, "At a bar."

And just like that, she saw the shield go back up in his eyes. Dr. Fonda sighed. He was proving a tough nut to crack. But she'd get there eventually.

She always got what she wanted from her patients in the end.
