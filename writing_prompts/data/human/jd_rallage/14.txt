"Lil' Suze? A no show, huh. Well, maybe somebody can go and find where Lil' Suze has got to." The announcer seemed a little flustered, but he was a professional. He found his patter again. "And our final contestant, ladies and gentleman is the one, the only... TONY HAWK!"

Unlike the previous contestants, each of whom had entered the arena to resounding cheers, this last name drew only low murmurs. Most had never heard it. A few, with interests in the history of the sport, remembered an old athlete of that name, back when skating had been in its infancy. But that man was long dead now, and had been doing the Eternal Ollie in the sky for the better part of three centuries.

The figure shuffled into the arena in silence, a hooded sweatshirt up over his bent head so that his face was invisible. He carried a skateboard-sized metal case under his arm, and only when he had finally taken his place at the end of the half-pipe did he place this case down.

The announcer was still talking, gamely trying to fill the silence. "I understand that Hawk has come out of retirement and is here by special invitation. He's certainly made the most unusual entrance that I've ever seen-"

The figure glanced up at the commentary box. For a moment, the outline of a gaunt face was outlined by the stadium lighting. Then he pointed a gloved finger up at the commentary box, and the announcer went abruptly silent.

A low whisper that carried around the stadium said, "I never retired. I only went in search of true mastery."

The stadium was gripped in a tense silence as 50,000 fans waited to see what would happen next.

The figure that called itself Tony Hawk unlocked the metal case and lifted out a board of solid black. There was a collective exhale of 50,000 breaths released simultaneously. Hawk placed the board down on the lip of the pipe, and small flames licked up around the wheels.

Murmurs began to fill the air. 

"Sick, man, that's Vecna's Plank..." 

"Whose plank, bro?" 

"Dude, what's a Vecna?"

"This is from a game?"

"What do you mean, 'just like in the movie'?"

"You're telling me that's some mythical board? I dunno, that's pretty sketch."

"Whatcha been smoking, sister?"

As the figure bent forward over the board, a necklace slipped out of his sweatshirt. It hung for a moment on a chain around his neck before a wizened hand quickly stuffed it back in. But not before everyone in the stadium had caught a glimpse of the twisted metal, and, as one, shuddered in revulsion at its chilling aura.

"You...," one of the other skaters stepped forward, a tall woman with blond dreds. She pointed an accusing finger at the thing called Tony Hawk. "I saw you with Lil' Suze five minutes ago. She was talking with you, and then she was gone, as if she'd been sucked into that thing... that amulet or whatever. I thought it was just the weed, but now..."

A low voice emanated from under the hood, travelling through the air on waves of pure menace, "But now?"

Another man, the bookie's favourite going into the competition, said, "So not cool, brah. What did you do to Lil' Suze?"

A few security guards began to drift towards the hooded figure.

"Lil' Suze was just a poseur," the figure that had once been Tony Hawk rasped. "She did not have the talent or the dedication to justify her place here. We must all make sacrifices for our art. I myself have made many over the years.

"I stole this board of power from the hoard of an ancient red wyrm, and escaped only with the loss of my left pinky. I have descended into the Nine Hells to trick Asmodeous himself into teaching me the secret of the Devil's Grind, for the false promise of a soul I no longer have and the true enmity of all fiends for the rest of eternity. I have practiced my moves daily in the gnarliest skatepark in all the planes, the back of the Great Leviathan herself as she swims through the deep places. 

"I have drunk the poison of Orcus, and so I ask you now, 'What is one more sacrifice?'"

He waved another hand, and the security guard closest to him froze in the act of reaching for his arm.

"And now... let us give the masses what they came for. Let us tear it up!" Dark energy began to crackle around his claw-like hands, wreathing all nine fingers in purple illumination. "How do you want to do this?"
