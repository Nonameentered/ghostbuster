The doorbell rang late on a Friday night, long after any sane and God-fearing person had locked their door for the night.

Against his better judgement, Timothy "Little Timmy" Fallow undid his deadbolt, and allowed the door to open to the end of the security chain. The porch was dark and deserted.

"Hello?" he ventured. 

There was a scuttling sound, of many little feet, and something small and pale flashed past Timothy Fallow's feet before he could slam the door closed.

Not taking his eyes from where the thing had stopped, Fallow groped behind him in the dark hallway and found the handle of an umbrella.

"Damn cats," he muttered, although it was an awfully small cat.

He flicked on the light. It wasn't a cat.

A small shrimp hovered a few inches above the carpet, fluttering on a pair of white feathery wings.

"Good evening, Mr. Fallow," it said politely.

Fallow pointed the tip of his umbrella towards the creature. "Who in the Shrimp's name are you?"

"Oh, how observant of you," the creature said. "Just the qualities we're looking for in our Prophet. You can call me Ozik."

Fallow swept the umbrella towards the door in a motion that screamed *Get out!*, and his lips made the same words but no sound came out.

The creature sighed. "Ah, yes. The First Refusal. As it was foretold in the Book of Prawn, so it comes to pass."

Fallow managed to splutter, "What... what are you?"

"I come on behalf of the Great Shrimp," the creature said. "I am Her messenger in this mortal plane. Weren't you expecting me? Didn't you get our missives?."

The tip of the umbrella began to droop, as did the creature's face.

"Oh dear," it said. "You *didn't* get the messages. There must have been a mix-up. What's the address here?" It didn't wait for a response, which was lucky, as Fallow was in no condition to give one, but instead it flew up to the table holding that morning's mail. "Ah, no wonder. Street, not Avenue. Some poor soul across town must be frightfully confused."

It chuckled at Fallow, as if the two were sharing some private joke.

"Still, we ought to get going, Prophet Fallow," the creature said. "No time to waste, and all that."

Fallow said, "Holy Shrimp."

"I'd tell you not to take the Lady's name in vain," the creature said, "but frankly it's the only thing that's kept the Church alive these past few years."

It flapped a wing, and a hat rose from the coat rack and landed on Fallow's head. Then the creature flew over the the door and looked back at him expectantly.

"Well, come on," it said. "Demolition is scheduled to begin in half an hour, and a representative of each Church needs to be there."

Fallow's feet began to pull him out the door.

"Holy Shrimp," he muttered.

In his ear, a feminine voice whispered, "Hurry, my dear Prophet. Apocalypses hate to be kept waiting."

And then it added, "You should probably hang onto the umbrella. It might get a bit damp.
