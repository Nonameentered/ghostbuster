After six months hunting the worst kind of poachers in South Africa, Quentin Mosk wanted nothing more than to find a backward little beach and drink himself into oblivion. A week on the island paradise of San Doru should have been perfect. It should have been nothing but drinking in bars, drinking on the streets, drinking on the pier, and if he was lucky, in the bedroom of an accommodating local.

He did not get his drinks.

Instead, he was here, lying flat on scuffed-up ceramic tile in a dingy hotel lobby with his trusty M14 sitting in front of him. The rifle’s barrel rested on a barricade of makeshift ‘sand bags,’ most of which were sacks of potatoes. The gaps between were shored up with smaller bags of rice and powdered sugar, all duct taped together and wedged into the gaps. 

Basically anything baglike in the kitchen had been appropriated for his defenses, much to the dismay of the cooking staff.

Mosk listened with half an ear as the lingering whine of artillery shells filtered in from beyond the rose-tinted windows. They’d mainly been shelling the south side of the city, but still he listened. Even if it would make no difference, he wanted to know if he was about to be blown apart into tiny little meat chunks. 

It’s just the way he was. 

“So you’re the cranky old vet.” A voice with a heavy southern twang spoke up from behind.
Mosk spared a glance back. In that fraction of a second he observed two things. 

First was the holster at the man’s hip. It was leather, fancy, and it held a six-shooter with a long barrel and engraved ivory handle. The revolver was even older than Mosk’s aging M14. He wanted to sneer, but at the very least the holster was angled correctly and the hand that rested on it had the right calluses in the right places.   

Second thing he noticed was that the man was a goddamn cowboy. He had on big, leather boots with silver tips, a red checkered shirt, a belt buckle the size of a sand dollar, and all the rest to go with it. He looked like he’d stepped straight out of a shitty cigarette billboard. 

“Heard you’re holdin’ down the fort all by your lonesome.” The cowboy said with a grin that didn’t touch his pale blue eyes.

“And who the hell are you?” Mosk turned back to keep watch on the rose-tinted warzone outside.

“Name’s Bryce.” The words came slow and lazy, a strange counterpoint to the screams of artillery shells far above.

“And who the fuck are you, Mister ‘Bryce?’” Mosk spared another half second glance, his iron-filing eyes spearing the baby blues of the other, “You some dumbass actor down here to play cowboy for the locals? Sellin’ yer off-brand cigs and ten gallon hats? Get the hell back up to your room.”

“Actor? Heavens no.” Bryce seemed disgusted by the notion. “I’m a performer.”

“And what’s the damn difference?”

“Well—”

A staccato of gunshots cut him off. The tinted windows rattled and shook. A neon ‘Corona Lite’ sign fell from the wall and shattered into a thousand yellow shards. 

Mosk settled himself behind the sights of his M14. He panned back and forth over the doors and windows. This was shit. It was all shit. There were multiple entry points, poor defensive positions, and a goddamn wannabe cowboy as his only backup. 

*Just Wonderful,* He thought to himself.

The soldiers that charged past the windows did so in a flash, moving up and slamming the double doors wide open. They were a ragtag bunch, no standard uniform between them, just a set of bright yellow bands wrapped around their biceps and maroon-colored caps on their heads. Mosk counted three in tank tops, two in band T-shirts, and one in a filthy, mud-smeared dress shirt. 

Rebels. Just his luck.

The tank top in the lead started shouting rapidfire in spanish, or maybe it was portuguese. Mosk didn’t speak either. The rebel’s dark face got angrier the longer he yelled. They hadn’t raised their Russian surplus AK-47, so Mosk kept his own weapon carefully angled away. No need to start the party early, he figured.

“Y'all speak any english?” The cowboy managed somehow to shout slowly, carelessly, his left hand idly scratching the side of his chin. 

The rebels turned to yell at each other until the one in the dress shirt shuffled forward. 

“You!” He pointed a shaky finger at Mosk. “Put down!”

Mosk gave his answer with a shake of his head. 

“Put down!” Dress shirt took another step forward and pointed at the M14. “Put… DOWN!”

Mosk didn’t dare take his eyes off the agitated rebel. The boy in the dress shirt couldn’t be older than nineteen. Hell, none of them looked like they’d need to shave anything but their upper lips anytime soon. Mosk didn’t want to fire, but the AK-47’s they carried were serious weapons being waved about in a serious way. Once those rifles turned to point at him then he wouldn’t have a choice.

Six against one were real shitty odds, but they were what stood before him. 

“Put down NOW!” The dress shirt rebel charged forward and raised his rifle. 

The sound of the gunshot hit so fast that Mosk’s finger jumped on the trigger, the only reason he didn’t squeeze it down himself. His arm pulled the barrel up to the rebel’s face, and he stopped only a fraction of a second before letting all hell loose from his gun. A single atom’s twist of time kept him from blowing the poor kid’s skull straight into the ceiling. The kid’s eyes were wide like black marbles. A shaking set of fingers rose up and ran themselves over a now-hatless head. His homemade cap was behind him on the floor, still smoking from the shot that had almost cut it in half.

Mosk flicked his eyes back over to Bryce and found the cowboy with his revolver in hand, a thin curl of dirty smoke still coiling out of the barrel. 

The other rebels charged forward, AK’s rising to take aim at the cowboy. Mosk raised his own sights toward tank-top number one. He took a quick breath, narrowed his eyes, and was once again set to pull the trigger when five shots rang out in sequence. 

This time he saw it happen. Five red caps flying off of five young heads, all in order, right to left. The crowd of young men stumbled to an awkward stop, feet and ankles twisting over the dirty, broken tiles. 

The lobby was almost silent. Six shots had been fired, six hats had been perforated. The only sound to hear was the slow, methodical clinking of the cowboy loading bullets into his gun, chamber by chamber.

“Now, boys...” Once again, Bryce managed to pitch his voice loud enough to fill the room but slowly enough that it sounded like nothing more than a friendly conversation. “We’re all just visiting yer little island. So I say… you boys go on your way, we stay here, and everybody stays alive. Ya’ll comprendé?”

“The hell you doing, boy?” Mosk hissed, “They don’t understand a word of yer shit!”

“It ain’t about the words.” Bryce drawled as he finished loading his gun. “It’s about how yer sayin ‘em.”

Dress shirt recovered first, charging almost all the way up to Mosk’s M14 and screaming: “PUT DOWN! PUT DOWN!” 

Mosk eyed the AK held in two dirty, shaking hands. The gun wasn’t aimed yet but it was on its way. 

“I don’t want to do this, kid.” Mosk turned his own rifle toward the rebel’s chest, taking the cowboy’s words to heart. He put all the things he didn’t want to do into the two words that came out of his mouth: “Back… OFF!”

For a long moment nothing happened. Mosk held his breath, curled his toes, and kept his eyes glued to the barrel of the kid’s AK-47. The black metal quivered and jerked left and right like it was bobbing over the surface of a lake, luring out the fish below.

Then the leader in the tank top gave a shout. The rebel squad backed out of the same door they’d charged through a minute ago, one by one moving out into the street and sprinting away. They ran alongside the tinted glass to the next building, to the next group of scared people huddling together while bullets and explosions tore their lives apart.

Mosk watched them go, breath tight in his throat. There were still six rifles in those hands, each of them capable of killing everyone in the hotel. Even out of sight they could do it. He waited for the shots, for the spray of unaimed bullets, uncontrolled death. He waited for the screams of the other guests, of children and families, workers and managers, all hiding away in their rooms behind and above.

Yet none of it came.

It took him ten minutes to relax. He pried a shaking hand off of his gun and placed it flat on the cold tile, pressing his fingers out until he could feel more than the prickling tingle of numbness that overwhelmed them. He’d been gripping the metal so tight for so long that he’d lost all feeling. 

“Performer… not actor.” Mosk said the words syllable by syllable, like they were something foreign and new. His eyes were locked on the six maroon caps scattered around the lobby floor, all with blackened holes through the cheap fabric. “That’s a hell of a difference, cowboy. Hell of a difference.”
