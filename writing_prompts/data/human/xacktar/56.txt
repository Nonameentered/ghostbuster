"Ladies and gentleman, boys and girls! welcome one and all to the thirty-first annual I.M.L. *International.* It is a beautiful day here in historic Kottbullar Park where we will watch the American's *Boston Bolognese* face off against the UK's own *York Pork Players!*"

"That's right, Shef. The *Bolognese* have had quite the spicy season already, starting off with that devastating injury to their head packer, Phil Aymenyon, who suffered three broken fingers on the first pack of the first game."

"Huge blow to their team, there, Cook."

"And then just two games later their incredible upset against the *Pittsburgh Penne* where they managed to squeeze out a win in double oversauce."

"Highlight of the season, for sure, but let's not discount the *York Porkies* either, they came out of *nowhere* mid-season to show a penchant for incredible plays made with astounding speed."

"I think a big part of that success stands on mighty, mighty shoulders of their left breadfetcher, Shawn Parma. He has the speed, the need, and the unstoppable agility to not only move into the enemy backlines and grab the early-game bread crumbs and eggs, but he has a record fourteen out of nineteen olive oil return rate in the first quarter."

"That is impressive, Cook, so impressive. Early ingredient acquisition is a huge boon to the packers, giving them the chance to get the ball packed, formed, and on the field that much sooner."

"Right you are, Shef. Oh, and here come the players now. Leading the team for the *Bolognese* is... well, I don't believe it!"

"Is that Phil Aymenyon?"

"It is, Shef, it is! He's back! He is BACK! After ten weeks out with a broken metacarpal, Phil Aymenyon is here and heading straight to the bowl!"

"The fans are going wild with excitement. You can feel it through the booth, in the stands, in the air. Cook, gotta tell you, they've been waiting for this moment all season and there is no better time to see their star back in action than here at the *International.*"

"But let's not forget the *York Pork Players!* They are bolting onto the field under the banner of their beloved team mascot, Poachy, the York Pork Pig!"

"My kids love Poachy, possibly more than they love me."

"Haha, right you are, Cook. They certainly do. And who can blame them? Leading for York is their head packer Basil Lantime with Shawn Parma right on his heels."

"They both look ready to roll their sleeves up and get their hands in the bowl today, Shef."

"That they do, Cook. Oh, here the ref with the game garlic bread."

"Looks like Aymenyon is taking butterside."

"There's the flip..... and it's butterside down, York gets bowl position!"

"Well, folks, with that settled it is now time to see the action, the plays, the game that will show off the best of the best in the I.M.L. Get your drinks, get your snacks, and *Llllllllets get ready to Meatbaaaaaaaall!"*
