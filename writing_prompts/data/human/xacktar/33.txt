Hi, Kat! I have crit for you! 

I had a bit of trouble tracking who Tom was in the beginning so I think you may want to bring him in by name first to make it a bit clearer! 

> Tom wiped his pale, thinning locks from his eyes. Sweat dribbled down his shiny, sunburned forehead. His glasses fogged from the exertion of weeding the herb bed.

I noticed that these starting sentences all begin with the same sentence structure. It felt a tiny bit off due to this.

> Annie grimaced her stomach knotting.

Missing a comma separating the two clauses.

> This was not the man she’d married. That man was confident, suave, and articulate.

I think the tenses here are a little bit off. I'm thinking you want 'That man had been' instead of 'That man was' if I am reading this correctly.

> anti-anger medicine

Is this a thing? I wasn't sure if we had slipped into a sci-fi setting when this showed up or it is something I just don't know about. If it is not either, then I might suggest being more specific with it, give us a medicine name, even if it is one you make up.

> “You what? Tomorrow’s my day with Jamie to catch up after traveling all week. We were going to practice cooking some nice Indonesian food in preparation for my Jakarta trip. Jamie loves our cooking days, don’t you, Jamie?”

I think there is a bit too much repetition of information in this dialogue. It felt like it was more narrative than dialogue. 

> Annie approved of the attention to detail, a point she prided herself on.

This is a bit tell-y. I think it would have been better if you had showed us her approval, or directly what she was thinking. 


Hope this all helps! I can't wait to hear the story at campfire!
