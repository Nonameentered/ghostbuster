Lemerd considered all of his past interactions with the orcs while he slowly rotated above one of their cookfires. He probably knew more than most people due to his colorful, if troubled, past. 

First, there was the whole thing with winning that orc bride. That had been troublesome. Luckily, where drinking had done him wrong, some sober thinking had turned things around. Well, kind of. Then there was the badger race down south. How was he supposed to know that baby orcs kept them as pets? Finally, there was the series of events that led him here, tonight, to being a side-dish in progress.

On the upward rotation he waggled his head at the orc turning the spit, "Oi, brudda! Hey, ehm, Looks like you got plenty to eat tonight, so... why am *I* on the menu?"

Turning-spit orc glared at him, huffed a thick, yellow steam out between its massive tusks, then said, "Yous one dat one dat dishonor chief."

Again, Lemerd walked his mental fingers through the many files labeled 'Made the orcs mad.' 

"Which chief?" 

There was a grunt and more steam, "Chief Bu'kha. He gift yous honor of marriage to daughter. Yous spit on gift."

Lemerd wiggled in indignation, "I never spit on Nah'kha! she was sweet."

"Yous dishonor gift."

"He lost her in a card game! He bet her on a pair of jacks!"

"Dey was honorable jacks."

Lemerd slumped, then straightened again as the flames below reminded him why slumping was momentarily bad. He figured he had about six more spins around before the last shred of dignity around his waist caught fire and left him feeling *really* exposed. He racked his mind for details about Bu'kha. Unfortunately, the number one thing that connected all his knowledge of the orcs was that each time started by drinking orcish mulled wine. 

Would be nice if he could remember anything after, but alas, each event was nothing but a hazy blur. 

"Look, I'm sure we can work this out, right? Nah'kha and I are good friends! She opened a nice flower shop down-"

"Quiet, meat." 

Lemerd the meat went quiet. The flames rotated closer once again and he gripped the burning iron of the spit while he looked around. A few feet away there sat one of the small, black barrels that held the fiendish orc drink. Stuff was highly flammable too. 

He glanced from the barrel, to the fire, to the orc above, "Heyyyyy, sooooo, brudda, um.... up for a game?"

The thick, green hide of the orc's face bent closer, blowing hot, sulfuric steam into Lemerd's face. 

"Wat?" It rumbled. 

"A game, drinking game! We..... both drink till the other can't. You win, I hop right back on here and cook away. I win, well..."

"I not let go."

"Tell you what, you win and I'll just...uhhhhhhhh... roast myself! No more turning the crank thing there. Sounds good, yah?"

"Dis *is* hard work... hmmm."

"Sure is, bruddah. That's why you need a drink!"
