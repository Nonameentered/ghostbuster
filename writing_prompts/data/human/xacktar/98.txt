Count Augustin watched as the whales were pulled down from the sky. 

Their wings always touched first, the great leathery pieces that looked so clear and white from below, yet were great and bulbous once they reached ground. Something changed after the killing blow, after the great beasts succumb to the hooks and harpoons and let their ballasts free. They lose their glory, lose their luster. 

It was much like man, in that way. All glory vanishes upon death.

"Your excellency, I must protest." 

The Count turned to regard his Grand Steward, the master of all his holdings and businesses in the city of Greyhook. Lord Girard au Lustinia had served the Count faithfully and without pause for nigh on seventeen years. In all that time, the Count had seen the man so pale, or with such a sheen of sweat upon his brow.

"The fleet..." The Grand Steward went on. "To disband it now, when the hauls hold numbers never recorded, it is folly!"

Count Augustin raised an eyebrow at this. Girard had a natural way of dancing around the issue when he believed he Count had done something in error, through foolishness or ignorance. Yet here, now, as the screaming of the  whales and the shouts of the skydock butchers reached the balcony they stood upon, he dared speak plain.

"Folly?" Count Augustin gestured toward the paper reports on a nearby table, all handwritten, all signed with the Grand Stewards own hand. "These record numbers, this great harvest of oil and flesh, you read each line, tallied each column?"

"Every one, my lord." The Grand Steward once again made boldness his move and stepped up till he was closer to the Count than custom dictate he should approach. "If we... destroy our company this way, withdrawal completely, then Count Peritoch will have the opening he has ached for these past decades. He will take our routes, our harvest. He will have what is needed to push us-"

"The numbers." The Count cut him off, the interruption used as a reprimand for stepping so close. "Tell me about the numbers."

"But-"

"How many slain?"

"Over seven thousand since March, your Excellency."

The Count placed his hands on the wrought iron rail that ran around the balcony, hands burning from the sun-baked black. "And how many were female?"

"I will have to check."

"Over five thousand." The Count answered. "Four thousand of which were of breeding age. My spymaster informs me that Peritoch has caught more than that, and the lesser ventures also taking in as many as their ships can tow to dock." 

The Grand Steward was silent now, standing up slowly from where he had bent down to examine the table.

"In total, an estimated eleven thousand breeding females now burn in our lamps and sit salted in our larders. Eleven thousand that can no longer give birth or raise the young."

"But they always come back."

"Hmph." Was the Count's only response. 

"Are you saying...?"

"There will be a famine." The Count said it plainly. "For many years, as I see it. We have destroyed the herd, taken more than we should. In our fight for territory and accounts this was overlooked. I am as responsible as Peritoch and Le Moutte and even more so in some respects. It was our ships that carved this enterprise out from the clouds, was it not?"

"It was, your Excellency."

"And now we depend on it, we need it just to work and eat. I have a fear, a great fear that this will turn us to ruin, Girard." 

He heard the quiet gasp as he said the Stewards name, it was an even greater breach of protocol than stepping close unbidden. Yet at this moment, the protocol seemed immaterial. 

"So disband the fleet." The Count moved on, his voice low and weak. "Empty the yards. Empty the coffers to keep them paid, for we will need them, I hope. We will need everything we have gathered and saved and horded as our God-given gifts for our cleverness and aggression."

"What... what can we do?"

Count Yustal au Augustin, heir the to house of Augustin and thirteenth in the royal line of Le Maris lowered his gaze from the sky full of beast and ship. He stared out beyond the walls and docks and towers of the city, out to the shimmering reflections that rippled with the wind-tossed waters. 

"I'm thinking of the ocean, Girard. The great, wide ocean."
