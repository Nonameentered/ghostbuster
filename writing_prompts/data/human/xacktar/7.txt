Doctor Emma Layter marched up in front of her friends and coworkers holding a shoebox, a set of burned cables, and a small, plastic water bottle. She set the items in the dirt at her feet, lifted her head and began to speak.

"We are gathered here today to honor a fallen comrade." She had a perfect speaking voice: clear, loud, and quick, "Jerry was more than just a part of our team. I remember the moment he first arrived at our lab, I looked him straight in the eyes and thought to myself: 'This one is gonna be trouble.'"

A murmur of muted laughs rippled through the crowd. 

"And I was right! Within the first week Marge caught him in her office, stealing her lunch." Emma looked down and smiled, "She opened the door and there he was, carrot stick in his mouth, eyes wide as saucers."

"Never heard Marge scream like that!" Someone yelled out.

"Jerry was a scamp, a scoundrel, a rotten little fiend... and we loved him." Dr. Layter lifted her head, "During pre-certification trials for RF-9167, Jerry was running two, maybe three sample tests an hour. He was *unstoppable.*"

The assorted lab techs and office workers called out with a scattering of 'Yes' and 'Hear hear.'

"He never wavered, never complained... Okay, he had a tendency to run off and swipe food that didn't belong to him, but who could blame him? That was just Jerry. We couldn't run a single test without making sure he had something to munch on."

Dr. Layter paused for a moment. She pulled out a tissue from her purse and dabbed her eyes.

"More though, Jerry is... our hero." Her voice cracked a little as she spoke, "When we were three weeks behind schedule and our funding was up for review, when it looked like our project was hopeless, destined to be shut down. It was Jerry, Jerry who saw our great need and took it upon himself to act!"

She reached down and picked up the bundle of burned wires, holding them up above her head in a clenched fist. 

"It was Jerry who escaped his lab. It was Jerry who crawled through three stories of ventilation shafts to the server room. It was Jerry who wiggled his way into the L3 server, grabbed these wires with his teeth, and bit clean through!"

The crowd was cheering, gloved hands waving and clapping.

"By frying the L3, Jerry gave us *hope*, hope we dared not ask for. It is because of his heroic sacrifice that we now have a six-week extension on our review!" 

Dr. Layter bent down and placed the wires on the shoebox, then lifted both up before her, like she was offering it to a heathen god as a sacrifice. 

"To Jerry!" They chanted, "To Jerry!"

"To Jerry," Dr. Layter said, her voice little more than a hoarse whisper, "Crazy, wonderful little rat."
