"Behold, I am Super-Lady!" Avery announced as she jumped out from behind a stack of dusty weight equipment. 

She had a mask on, one far too large for her. It was just as dusty as everything else in their grandfather's garage, but you could still see the gleam of the bright green and shiny black underneath. 

Tyler left the chair of the ancient computer console he'd been pressing buttons on. "Where'd ya get that?"

"Over here." 

They retreated around some weights, past a pair of black motorcycles, and around the remnants of a chemistry set to find at least a dozen mannequins shoved into the corner. Each had their own costume, most in a motif of black and green, but not all. There was yellow and dark pink, dark blue and purple, but they were always paired: Always.

"These ones looks familiar." Tyler raised a hand and slapped it down on a plastic shoulder, causing dust to explode off of it. "They was in a hist'ry book at school.'"

"Yeah?" Avery dropped her own mask and looked up. "Why?"

Tyler shrugged. "I dunno. Didn't read it or nuffin."

They stared in silence for a moment before they both tried to pull the tight fabric off the plastic torso.

"Let me do it!" Avery whined.

"I'm stronger."

"Are not!"

"Ya-huh!"

"Just get your hands off-"

"STOP IT!" A door slammed open behind them and they turned to find the imposing figure of their grandfather outlined by the sunlight from the back yard. "Hands off, THIS INSTANT!"

Fingers unclasped and arms snapped to sides as if they hadn't been touching anything, ever, not for a million years. 

"What have you been doing? I told you- I TOLD YOU!" Grandpa stormed his way through the mess until he was towering over each of them, one hand holding his bad hip while the other alternated between pointing and curling into a fist. "You need to stay out of here!"

"Why?" Tyler rolled his eyes and leaned on a nearby table, "It's just a bunch of-"

The sound of glass breaking cut him off. All eyes turned to the sound. The table he'd picked had apparently held something round and glass and it had rolled off and shattered into a thousand pieces. 

Grandfather made a sound, it was a terrible sound. It superseded all scolding and yelling in the kid's minds. It was a sound that they'd never heard come from him before. It was the strained cry of a soul-swallowing sorrow. 

"No..." He whispered as he knelt down to search through the glass shards. "No..no..."

Avery and Tyler stood shock still, afraid to move, to even wince. They were suddenly in uncharted territory.

"Why?!" Grandpa's choked tears burst apart with a roar of anger. "You want to know WHY?"

Tyler wanted to run. He wanted to hide.

"It's because..." He pulled a burnt piece of fabric from the shards. "This is all I have left of him now."
