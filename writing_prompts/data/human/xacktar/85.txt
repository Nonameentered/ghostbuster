*This is highly unusual.*

The dragon exhaled, not with burning flame, but with a rattling, rasping huff. 

"It shouldn't be. I don't see why the previous monarchies spent *all* that time training and armoring knights, when, In fact, you- Oh, one moment!" The small man standing before the dragon opened up his bag and withdrew a collection of papers. "Ah, there we are. You have successfully incinerated twenty-three out of twenty-three 'Rescuers' sent to 'Win Back the Princess.' That is a one-hundred percent success rate."

*This is true.* The dragon lowered it's head and shuffled a bit more out from the massive gates that protected the tower he lived within. *And I will continue to do so.*

"And my client is *deeply* sorry about all of those attempts. Different management, messengers got crossed, you know how it goes."

*No.* The dragon's eyes became slits of burning sulfur. *I do not.*

"Well...." The man shuffled back half a step. "In any case, the, uh, 'New Kingdom' management had sent me to discuss with you the possibility of perchance-"

*I tire of your words. Where is your weapon? Where is your steed? Draw and charge, little stick, so that I may enkindle you.*

"Well! I'll have you know that I am *not* a man of violence!" The small man actually marched up to dragon, arms' length from a set of teeth that outweighed him two-to-one. "This is a new era! One where we may reach equitable terms through the synergistic application of customer-centric content and efficient maximization of value-added strategies."

*What?*

"I am talking about a new paradigm! A re-alignment of core values!" The man waved the papers around, drawing the focus of the dragon to their fluttering. "Look, dragon, pal. You have something we want: a young, mint-condition princess. That has been firmly established. What I'm here to ask is what *you* want. As an associate of *Zipplezap, Zetahk, and Lex*, I am fully prepared to represent all relevant parties in an-"

*Cease thy endless prattle!* A gout of flame rushed from each nostril, catching the man between them. *I want for nothing.*

The diminutive associate slowly pulled his hand back trying to extinguish the small fire it was holding. "Per-perhaps, perhaps. Still, there must be something you desire?"

*I desire to silence thy screeching tones and burn all who stand against me!*

"Now we're getting somewhere!" The associate dropped the charred remains of the papers and pulled yet another stack of them from his bag. "Now, tell me... approximately how many knight-burnings would it take to, say, give my client a three-year lease on the princess?"

*...What?*

"You let us 'borrow' the princess for a few years, then, in compensation, the law firm of *Zipplezap, Zetahk, and Lex* promises to provide the approached party, you, with a set number of knights to burn."

*How... many?*

"Yes."

A burst of flame and a gnashing of teeth set the papers free. 

*More than one.*
