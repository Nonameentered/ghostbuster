Though I am massive and a terror

And a thousand-one years old

Out of all my worldly treasures

There is nothing quite like gold.

&nbsp;

Gems may sparkle in the cave light

Silver gleams prismatically

Platinum and Rhodium

May be prized... just not by me.

&nbsp;

I dislike the way the gemstones slide,

Silver quickly turns to black,

Rhodium, it blinds the eyes,

And platinum just smells flat.

&nbsp;

So if you wish to bribe a Wyrm

And avoid my violent fire,

Then offer not your silver coin

It buys nothing but my ire.

&nbsp;

For when I fly back to my roost,

Deep under mountain's dark,

Ancient bones and weary head

Seek rest in warmth apart.

&nbsp;

And silver, gems, the other things

They're all so harsh and cold.

To a dragon seeking restful sleep

There is nothing quite like gold.
