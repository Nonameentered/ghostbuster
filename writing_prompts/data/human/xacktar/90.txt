>"I like to find inspiration in the people around me and the people I get to interact with on a daily basis. My daughter is such a huge inspiration because she really loves all the high fantasy stuff. Before going to bed we sometimes tell each other stories and take turns adding on to them and making them more elaborate. Itâ€™s all so much fun."



This is so cute and lovely! I might die from it. It's so great to have someone you can share stories with and who is just as excited as you to be a part of them!
