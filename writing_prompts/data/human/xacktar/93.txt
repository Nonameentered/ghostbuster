It was a knock he'd waited three weeks to hear, so when it came he felt not the urge to rush, to run and stumble and pull open the door in a grand gesture of joy. 

Instead he felt the dread. 

The dread of hope that may soon be crushed. Christopher had waited so long, sent the letters with fear on every curve of ink within them. There were a thousand ways to be wronged, a thousand more to be betrayed by fate, circumstance, the servants, the mailmen.

The knock rung out again and he rose himself from the chair, pulling his robe close to ward of the cold that filled the cabin when one moved from the light around the fireplace. 

He reached the door, set his hand upon the locks and waited, hoped, feared. The wind crashed and howled outside, the cold seeping through the cracks and prickly skin and blood and bone beneath. 

He knew a third knock was coming yet he would not let it be. He pulled the bolt over and bade the door open.

James Clarence Jones' face stared back at him. It was the face he'd hoped for, prayed for. 

The poor man was coated in frost. Christopher grabbed for him, pulling him in toward the fire, his hands and arms soaking in the snow and turning it into bone-chilling waters. James Clarence had been many things to Christopher over the past ten years. He was a rival, a goalpost, a colleague, a friend...

Now it seemed he was more. 

"I read them all." He said through frozen lips, "Though few I had to burn for fear of what might be found within. Yet the words within I still hold inside, and still I feel them burn."

Blood thundered in league with his heart as Christopher listened.  "James..."

"I have not long." James Clarence pushed away, setting himself at arms distance but letting his arms linger on shoulders. "A day, no more. You had time to plan, I did not. I'm only here as a ghost between Memphis and home. I can't-"

"It's enough." Christopher told him. "Enough to sit together with nought but the wind between us, no ears turned unseen upon us. It is enough to have opened that door and seen..." 

The words failed him. Then words were secondary. Then words weren't needed at all. 

Yet outside in the snow a shadow cast against the door and through the wind and tearing of the trees one might have heard the steady crunch of boots walking steadily closer, and closer.
