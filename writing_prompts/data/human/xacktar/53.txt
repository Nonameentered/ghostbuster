A tower west, a tower east;

Each built to scare foul, foreign beasts.

On tower west a young man paced,

Lamenting war his nation faced.

For he was not the warring type,

Hated leading, loathe to fight.

Yet on his head sat princely gold

And king and queen were growing old.

It'd fall on him to order death

Despite how much in heart he wept.

&nbsp;

On tower east, a maiden stewed

Lamenting foolish war that brewed.

She yelled objections: sought and brought.

Yet father King, he listened not.

So she scowled on tower east,

Dreading end to kingdom's peace.

If only one would bend an ear.

And listen to her reasoned fear.

But she was princess, not a prince

So she was 'frail' and 'without sense'

Or so the courts did say and swear. 

As they dismissed her righteous fear.

&nbsp;

Then one day, on tower west

The prince heard havoc, loud unrest.

He stood and gazed across the moor,

For which his country would soon war,

And spied upon the tower east

A woman rage like captured beast.

And rather than to be appalled

He found, instead, he was enthralled.

She had passion and a deadly grace

As she screamed and cursed and paced.

So in a fit of foolish swell

He stood on tower's wall to yell,

And scream, and laugh, and wave his hands

To the crazy woman from foreign lands.

&nbsp;

At that time, on tower east, 

The princess and her fit did cease

For some young fool was screaming back

From the tower that they'd soon attack.

'He must be brave. He must be bold!'

She thought, seeing such a scene unfold

For he stood on just the thinnest ledge

On towers wall: a fearful edge.

She wished to know what type of man,

Who lived in that far borderland,

Would rage and scream and beat his chest

Upon that tower to the west. 

&nbsp;

And so to tower west there came

A letter crest in royal frame.

The man, he opened it to find

A message stern, but also kind.

From the Princess Ayaseer.

Before the dark of night drew near

The Prince, he wrote in joyful peace,

And sent it back to tower east. 

&nbsp;

The letters flowed; forth and back

Each tower rising stack on stack.

As the drum of war grew bold,

And envoys took to horse and rode,

There hid among those diplomats

The wild prince, clad all in black.

And on the eastern tower's side

The Princess also took to hide

And so in moorland's grass they met

While envoys sought their war to set.

Yet under dark, so says the lore

Two bodies kissed, embraced, and more.

And after a time in breathless rest.

They declared to envoys, east and west

That a marriage they would undertake

To bind two kingdoms ripe with hate.

Or else let slip their indiscretion

To both sets of courtly session.

&nbsp;

And so the towers: east and west.

Were well forgotten, put to rest.
