"Stev? Are you Stev?"

Stev woke up, stared at the geometrically intricate wall that had caged him in for what seemed like forever. He levered his massive body up off of his cot. His tentacles were shriveled and turning an unhealthy gray. Not enough water, not enough light.

"I am." He mumbled as he peered through the hexagonal gaps at the creature beyond. It was thin, gray, puny... it looked only vaguely akin to the monsters that had invaded and enslaved his homeworld.

"And you are human?" It asked him. 

"No." 

"Oh. Are you sure?"

Stev closed six of his ten eyes and quickly calculated the gaps in the cage, the amount of atrophy to his tentacles, and then how close the little idiot outside would have to be for him to crush him into paste. The math was not in his favor. 

Stev pointed to the cage next to his. "That's the human. His name is Steve, not Stev."

"Ah, thank you!" The alien shuffled over and repeated his question.

What answered was a mess of wailing, scratching, panicked screaming, and the usual distress that most creatures in the prison barge got up to on a regular basis. The assistant conqueror waited patiently until it ended.

"Yes, we get that a lot. Now, how do humans turn gold into Nitrous Oxide?" 

Stev perked up at this. Elemental transmutation was something that even his species had struggled with. He wriggled his way over to that side of the cage to observe.

"What?" Steve said after a long moment. "We don't."

"Not according to our post-enslavement reports. We have extensive records of previously unknown elements in wide circulation upon your planet, elements with incredible transmutational properties!"

"....What?"

"Come now, Stev."

"Steve." Stev corrected.

"Right, Steve. Tell us about the elements."

"What elements?!" 

"According to our records, earth possessed the elements of confusion, surprise, lightheartedness, style, and many others in lesser degrees. We are *particularly* interested in this element of lightheartedness. Long name, sounds complicated. It says here that it comes in several states on earth, which implies a low melting point."

"What are you talking about?" Steve cried.

"Look, we know about the solid state: Laughing Matter, also referred to as 'Comedy Gold.' We also know about the liquid state of Laughing Stock, what we want to know is about how we arrive at Laughing Gas, which has been extensively documented as being Nitrous Oxide."

For a long moment the human Steve just stared at him, then glanced at the muscular tentacle monster in the cage next to his, then back to the conqueror. 

"I don't have any idea... but I can show you one of the other elements."

"Oh, that is progress." The conqueror chittered excitedly. "Please show me."

"You have to back up first, go stand over there." He pointed right next to Stev's cage. "A little further. There, perfect."

"Which element is it?" 

Tentacles wrapped around the puny alien, cracking it in half.

"Surprise!"
