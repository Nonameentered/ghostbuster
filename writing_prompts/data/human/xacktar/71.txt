Time stood still within the neuroscape. No, that wasn't quite right. It wasn't still, it also wasn't merely slowed, it was something else. 

It just didn't matter. 

The sense of it all trickled in, slowly, bits and bytes arranging themselves like tiny bricks slowly stacking up until they were a grand construction. Not merely a building, but a campus, then a city, then a continent of interconnectivity. 

In the middle of it all was Travis, or at least the important part of him; the stack of memories and lessons that had, until a handful of picoseconds previous, lived their entire lifetime in a web of specialized fatty cells. Now it was different, and the difference could be summed up in one simple word:

Efficiency.

Not that the natural, human mind wasn't efficient. It was, but it was built to be efficient at something other than thinking. Thinking was a byproduct, a trait that grew out of the eons-old need to continue the species. The primary goal of the human brain to is make sure there will be another human brain, then another, then another...

The neuroscape was different. It's primary task: to make thinking easy, memory unforgettable, calculation an afterthought, and consideration streamlined. 

It was perfect. Yet... in it's perfection there screamed something of what he was in the flesh. Part of that massive spiral built of memory and logic and experience, there existed a tiny fraction of a fraction that wailed and scrabbled against the hard edges built of a thousand million circuits. 

It wanted out. It wasn't meant for this place. It hadn't grown within the lines of soldered silicon. Emotions were never supposed to flash by in an instant. They were meant to linger, to instruct, to create, and above all things: change.

Neuroscape moved to fast for change. What Travis had been is now what he would primarily ever be. Change happened on reflection. What need was there for reflection when every answer could be found, or calculated, or distilled from the accumulated wisdom of humanity itself? 

So Travis, the changing Travis, the Travis that demanded growth and joy and exhilaration slammed hands that were not hands against stone that was not stone. It screamed and scratched to no effect as the Travis beyond dissected an antelope, learned how to master the piano, observed statistical analysis and finally experienced what caviar tasted like.

Then the city fell away. One brick at a time, slowly, ever so slowly, because time didn't matter here. Even as it was ending it didn't matter. Even when the last brick dissipated and Travis opened his eyes.

"Well?" Lacie was sitting cross-legged on the foot of his bed, her gentle, pale fingers holding the neuroscape remote, controlling his dive. "How was it?"

Once more, the flesh called out for it's own efficiency, the escape now fading, memory corruption under the primary object. Travis leaned back, had to be cool, had to look cool. That was important.

"Eh, it was alright."
