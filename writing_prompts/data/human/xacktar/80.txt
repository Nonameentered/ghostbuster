"Where are the goldfish? I want to see the goldfish."

"Gramma, you need to speak a little-"

"They always have goldfish, you know. In the little bowls with the little balls. I always feel sad for the poor things. I try to win as many as I can, you know, just to help. I used to take 'em to the old pond in the park and let them go."

"Yes, Gramma, I know. Can you tune it down just a little? The priest is speaking."

"What?"

"You're shouting again! Did you put your hearing aids in this morning?"

"What? Sorry, dear, I think I forgot my ear doohickeys."

"OF course... Okay, watch my hands. Turn your volume down from here...to *here*."

"Are we going down the hill?"

"No, Gramma."

"They have the pig show down there, you know. Every year. Always smells like farts! Little Toby would always ask me that when I took him down there: 'When do the farts start, Gramma?' OH, that child! He kills me!"

"Yes... thanks for that."

"What's that, deary?"

"I said thank you for shouting that to everyone. Very helpful."

"Oh, that's nice. Do you want a toffee?"

"No, Gramma."

"I think I have one in my purse. Oh, where is my purse?"

"You haven't had a purse since '98."

"Oh, where did I put that. I must be losing my mind! I swear, if I keep this up... oh, deary, what's wrong?"

"Nothing, It's nothing, Gramma. I... I just need to you speak a little quieter."

"Oh, that's nice. You're a nice boy. Do you want an ice cream? They always have ice cream by the Ferris wheel. I used to buy some for little Toby after we took a ride to the top. He loved the Ferris Wheel."

"Gramma, please... This is a funeral."

"Funnel cake? Oh, of course, dear. Let's have some funnel cake. Just don't tell your parents!"
