Detective Sergeant Cleese Shay stepped past the first body and through the carnage around the dining room table, carefully lifting his trench coat in pinched fingers to make sure he didn't contaminate its carefully-muddied edges. 

"I've seen some terrible things in my time, but this?" He grunted as he pulled out a cigarette, a cigar, two brandy flasks and a lighter. "*This* takes the cake!" 

"Ummmm, *actually...*" A younger cop in uniform piped up behind him. Well, he was *almost* in uniform. He also had on one of the floppy, brown hats full of fishing hooks and little fake feathers on them. Some of which had become perilously loose so they  jangled as he moved about. This didn't stop him from reaching toward the table and grabbing a pie plate. "I think this takes cake? I mean, it's called a 'pie plate' but that doesn't mean it's *just* for pies. It-"

"How did it go with the lawyers, Teralli?" Shay cut him off. "Did we get anything from 'em?"

"Sorry, Sarge." Teralli shook his head, making the hooks and lines dangle and sway. "Somehow they knew we were on a fishing expedition."

Detective Shay sighed. His hand shook as he dipped his cigar in brandy, lit it on fire, then threw it on the carpet and crushed it under his heel. As things squished and crumpled together, something caught the detective's eye. 

"DAMN IT, Teralli!" He cursed. "Get this damn fishhook off my eye!"

"OH!" Teralli squealed. "I'm *soooo* sorry! Little dickens got away from me there!"

"Son of a whistling grandmother... Yer lucky that I'm a hardboiled, hard-pressed, hard-tack, hard drive, hard left-hand turn detective who is one day from retirement!"

"This is gonna sting a little... aaaaand there! All free! Just blink a bit and you'll be fine"

"You really are the worst..." Detective Shay let the words mumble off to sulk on their own time as he crouched down and lifted the tablecloth. He reached under one of the dining room chairs and pulled out a baseball glove. 

"Look at this! Do you know what this means, Teralli?" He turned the item over in his hands, revealing the back label that said it belonged to the editor of the local paper. "Do you?"

"Ummm..."

"Goddamnit!" Shay spat. "Don't you see? The press is gonna have a field day with this."

"Well, they're gonna need a baseball too, and a bat... and a field. I think there's a nice one a few blocks down twenty-second street. I wonder if they take reservations?"

"Not now, Teralli!" 

"Oh, well, of course not. The reservations would have to be booked weeks ahead."

"Goddamn it!" Shay pulled a cigarette case from his pocket. "I need some air."

"Um, I saw a box fan in the closet."

"A what?"

"A fan."

"That's it!" Detective Cleese Shay's hands shook as he tried to open the silver object in his hands. "That's just what I need to blow this case wide open."
