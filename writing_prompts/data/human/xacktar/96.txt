They said the laundry chute was haunted. 

Violet Francis had heard it from Slyvia at school, who'd heard it from a girl at summer camp, whose dad told her that he knew the lady who'd lived here long ago. 

"How can a *laundry chute* be haunted?" Sidney, Violet's little brother whined behind her as she pushed the rest of her teenage body through the open window. Bettleville Manor had been broken and moldy from before either of them were born. Rocks and baseballs had removed all the glass from every window and each door was soft enough from rot you could leave handprints if you pressed hard enough. 

"Sylvia told me it can sing!" Violet told him as he grasped his dirty little hand and pulled him up and through the window. "She-oof, she says it will sing you a love song if you open it up."

"So?" Sidney sniffed and got to his feet. "I have a clam that does that."

"That's a toy, it's different!"

"Why?"

"It just is!"

"Sounds stupid."

"You're stupid!"

Violet just through her hands up and stomped her way over the crooked floorboards. Brothers were the worst thing in the world. She'd rather live in a house like this alone than be stuck with a stupid little twerp who always left-

He thoughts stopped in their tracks as she heard something. It was like a long, low sigh but somehow colder, keener. 

"You hear that?" She whispered.

Sidney only sniffled and wiped his nose on his sleeve in response. 

"It's the song."

"No, it's not."

"Yes it is!" Violet glared. "I'll prove it!"

She pushed the heavy door to the room away, leaving handprints of her own as the wood cracked and opened underneath the pressure, releasing agitated termites. Violet hardly noticed, she was nineteen now. She was too old to be creeped out by a few bugs. She crept her way through the hall, listening as the breathless noise became clearer. There were words in it, soft little words calling from far away. 

*"...Down is up and up is.... turn me over, turn me over..."*

"See?" Violet stopped and put her hands on her hips, "I *told* you it was-"

She turned around to find that Sidney wasn't behind her any longer. 

"Coward." She shouted through the house, hearing the suffling of feet climbing back out the window from the room behind. 

Whatever. She would do this herself. It'd be better this way without him. She crossed the hallway next, being careful to test the floor with each step. Many of the boards were little more than bundles of jagged splinters, others cracked and crumbled at the slightest touch. It was like playing the floor is lava  but the floor was actually just pain.

Soon she found the laundry room. It was all door-less cupboards and rusted pipe fittings. The song was strongest hear. She could make out every word now. 

*"...day it takes me lower. Turn me over, turn me over!"*

There was something strange about the song. It was like it was saying words she'd heard before, of maybe in a voice she knew. It almost sounded like Jax. Jax had been her first crush, but he'd moved away a year ago. She was still angry at him for never leaving her his address. Jerk. 

Violet shook those thoughts away and found the chute at the far end of the room. She put all her strength into prying the lid open. She stood on tip-toes and shoved her head down into the darkness. 

"Hello?" She called out. 

The song kept playing, the soft voice breaking and becoming scratchy and raw with each word. 

*"Every day it drags me lower. Turn me over, turn me over! You don't know how much I owe 'er. Turn me over, Turn me over!"*

It totally sounded like Jax, but at the same time it didn't.

There was a flicker of light, blue and green and so near to the darkness that held it that it illuminated nothing more than the edges of the far end of the chute. A black square set against a black nothing. 

Violet pushed her toes higher, wiggling arms under the heavy lid and bracing herself along the side. She strained eyes and ears to see more, hear more. 

*"Turn me over, turn me over, turn me over, turn me-"*

The world tilted, the ground became the wall, the wall became the ceiling. The heavy door lifted as she fell further into the chute, then slammed down on her legs. She felt bones crack as she fell even further, skin scraping but not stopped her as her body slipped down into the dark. 

She landed in a pile of old sheets and clothes. The blue-green darkness showing her little more than that. She could see no walls, no doors or windows. All she could see was the chute above, the fabric underneath her, and the shimmering of her own blood as it seeped forth from her broken legs. 

"Help..." She wheezed as the pain threatened to rob her of her thoughts. "Help...Sidney.... help....me!"

*"That won't work."* Something said from behind her. 

Violet turned her head to see something else there in the pile with her a skeleton with skin. Flesh was pulled so tight over it's skull that the eyes looked like they would fall out. It was wearing a hat, though, a hat she knew. A hat with a fancy, swooping J on it.

*"You have to sing, Violet."* It whispered at her. *"You have to sing."*
