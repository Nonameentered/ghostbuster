It had taken Frederick an hour to convince Hilda to doff her furs, and another to get her to wear a gown. When the doors to her room finally opened, letting out a trio of harried maids, he came inside and stared. Her black hair that she usually wore in a braid had been set loose, tumbling over her tan shoulders. The purple gown the maids had picked out hugged her toned figure and flared out below her narrow waist.

"I must look ridiculous in these garbs," she muttered, tugging at her neckline.

"No." He swallowed. "No, you look stunning."

She glanced at him as if to see whether he was telling the truth and blushed. "Ever the sweet-talker." She glanced down her front. "Even so, I don't see how your women wear these things. There's not even a place to clasp a knife."

"Cutlery will be provided during the banquet, I assure you," he said dryly.

She squinted at him. "You make sport of me, husband."

"Just a little." Coming closer, he hugged her around the waist. "Thanks for doing this."

"It is only proper that I follow your ways when I'm here," she said gruffly.

"Bear with it for a little while," he said. "Then we'll borrow a couple horses from the stables and go for a ride."

She perked up. "I'll hold you to that."

"Frederick, the fifth Prince of the Empire, and his wife Hilda, the Chieftainess of the Northern Steppes," the herald announced.

Frederick started toward the throne under the curious gazes of the courtiers and his royal siblings. Hilda hastened to follow but tripped over the hem of her gown and caught herself on his arm. Duchess of Renia giggled. Frederick glared at her until she shifted uncomfortably and hid her face behind a fan.

They approached the throne. His father, emperor Roderick, was stately as always, if with new streaks of gray in his beard. 

"Welcome back, son," he said. "You look healthy. The life in the steppes must agree with you."

"It does," Frederick said simply. 

He held his father's gaze calmly, the way he wouldn't have been able to three years ago. Something like approval crossed the emperor's face, and he turned his attention to Hilda.

"Welcome to my court, Lady Hilda, and thank you for coming all the way here."

Rather than curtsy in the manner of court ladies, she just inclined her head. "I greet you in the name of the Telua, my emperor."

The courtiers murmured at the violation of etiquette, but the emperor just smiled. "Tales of your people's prowess in battle have reached even our city. We're glad to have you aligned with our great Empire."

Hilda nodded proudly. They exchanged a few more pleasantries, and Frederick and his wife took their place beside the courtiers. He was well aware that they stood out. He was no short man, but his wife was even taller than he, and carried herself with the confidence of a warrior. Even he had changed during his time in the steppes. His face was weathered by the wind and the sun, and he had acquired a wiry strength he hadn't had when he lived an easy life in the palace.

His later siblings were introduced after him alongside their spouses. Much like him, they had been married off to distant lands in father's ongoing quest to secure alliances. Frederick hoped they would be fortunate enough to find happiness as he had.

***

The reception was followed by a banquet. It was a private event, but his eight siblings and their families as well as several dukes and duchesses who were royal cousins made quite a crowd.

The emperor clapped his hands and ordered the first course brought in. Frederick folded the napkin in his lap and picked up the knife in his right hand and the fork in his left. Seated opposite him, Hilda copied him with a look of intense concentration on her face. Frederick hid a smile. He felt guilty for enjoying her discomfort but couldn't help finding it amusing.

Conversations began flowing as they enjoyed the meal. Frederick would have liked to catch up with his brothers and sisters, but as luck would have it, he had been seated next to the Duke of Renia and his wife. As the banquet went on, the portly Duke downed one glass of wine after another, his face growing redder and his voice louder.

"I must say, Your Highness, I admire your work in expanding the Empire's alliances. Of course, some alliances are more propitious than others," he said, sending Hilda a meaningful glance.

His wife tittered as if he had made a great joke. Hilda scowled but remained silent.

Frederick frowned and dabbed at his mouth with the napkin. "I'm not sure as to your meaning, my lord."

A brief silence fell over the table, and more than one sibling looked at him with surprise. The duke appeared a little taken aback, but quickly recollected himself.

"I meant no offense, my dear boy," he said, chuckling. "It's just that—take the seventh princess, for instance. Her marriage to the Prince of Ilfad gives us access to their famed ports." He smiled at the princess's husband, who nodded graciously. "Compared to that, what does your marriage bring us? Horse and yurts?"

"I wouldn't underestimate the Telua," Frederick said quietly. "I lived with them for three years and witnessed their strength and tenacity first hand."

The duke chuckled. "I can tell the barbarians made an impression on you, but let's be reasonable. What is a horde of horsemen to our legions?"

The emperor frowned and opened his mouth, but Hilda acted first. Raising the silverware knife in her hand, she stabbed it into the table inches away from the duke's chubby fingers. He let out an undignified squeak and yanked his hand away. 

"You may look down on me," she growled, "but I won't let you disparage my people."

A stunned silence fell. The duke glanced around the table as if for support but found little. Frederick took an unhurried swallow of his drink, resisting the urge to grin madly. His wife was the best. Had he been standing, he might have swooned.

"Tell me, Hilda," he said into the silence. "How many warriors will answer your father's war horn?"

"Twenty thousand," she said proudly. "They ride like wildfire, and their arrows blot out the sun."

"These fierce warriors now defend the northern border from raiders—your lands included," Frederick said, watching the duke blanch. His own vaunted legion, after all, barely numbered five thousand. "You would do well to show some respect."

The duke dabbed at his brow with a handkerchief and inclined his head to Hilda. "Forgive me, my lady, I misspoke. I meant no disrespect to your people."

She squinted at him as if gauging his honesty, then huffed and effortlessly ripped the knife out of the table. The duke swallowed and sidled as far away from her as the width of his chair allowed.

The emperor clapped his hands, amusement dancing in his eyes. "Well then. How about some desert?" 

The meal passed without further incident, save for the duke's hands trembling so badly each time Hilda had reached for a knife that he spilled his drink over his gilded doublet.

Frederick was in a great mood as they retired to their chambers, but the same couldn't be said for Hilda. She turned away from him and frowned at the room's gilded tapestries as if they had personally offended her.

"What is it?" he asked, touching her shoulder. "Are you still sore about what the duke said?"

Hilda snorted. "That man is a pathetic fool who wouldn't last a day in the saddle. No, it is the luxury of this place that wears on me. Hearing it from you was one thing, but seeing it is another." She faced him and looked him squarely in the eye. "Don't you miss this life, husband? The fine silverware and seven course dinners, the servants to cater to your every need?"

He laughed and shook his head. "When I first came north, I thought I would. I resented my father and thought of your homeland as a frigid wasteland." He reached up to touch her cheek. "But then I met you. You taught me the beauty of the rolling steppes. The freedom of having a horse beneath me and the wind in my face. I wouldn't trade it for anything."

"You and your sweet words again," she growled good naturedly, and pulled him in for a brief kiss. "Won't help me out of this garb? I'm not letting those servant girls fuss over me again."

He smiled. "Gladly."
