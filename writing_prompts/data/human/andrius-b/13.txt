He awoke to a strange noise and bolted to his feet. The room spun, his vision blurring, but he could still see some strange glowing marks on his arm that weren't there before. Looking at the mirror, he gasped. His eyes glowed purple, the same purple as the marks.

The noise came again; shattering glass, then footsteps. He faced the door, his heart racing. The footsteps drew closer, more than one pair, and there was a hiss of inhaled air.

The footsteps ceased before the door was blasted from its hinges. In rushed two horrible humanoid creatures, impossibly pale, with mouths full of needle-like teeth and curved claws. 

He barely had the time to raise his arms defensively before the first monster slammed into him, claws grazing his forearm as they sought to puncture his throat. He kicked it, and the creature staggered back and snarled, spraying saliva. The second one flanked him and lunged at him. Before he knew what he was doing, he punched with his marked arm.

The marks flashed, and a transparent image of his fist burst forth, knocking back the monster and caving in its chest. It collapsed to the floor and didn't get up. The other one screeched and lunged again, but he brought up his marked arm in defense, and a barrier shimmered into existence, blocking the monster. As it staggered back, he snapped back its neck with another flying fist.

Hisses and growls drifted from outside. He glanced down at his arm, made a fist, and stepped out the door. A dozen of monsters lurked down the hallway, and upon seeing him, they all screeched and attacked.

The next few minutes were a blur of claws, blood, and flashes of purple energy. He found that he could tap the mark for a burst of strength, and used it to toss a monster at its brethren before finishing the lot off with a flying fist. He fought his way to the exit and found himself on a landing with a staircase and an elevator. 

He called the elevator, and with his back to the door, fended off more monsters rushing from upstairs. The door dinged open, and he leaped in. Jabbing the bottom button with his thumb, he blasted an encroaching monster from the elevator with his marked arm. 

The doors closed, and the elevator started to descend. He braced against the doors and ducked his head, panting for air. 

A creak of metal was his only warning before a heavy weight fell onto his shoulders and powerful arms clamped around his neck. They had broken into the cabin from above! As he struggled against the monster choking him, another leaped down before him. Snarling, it sank its claws into his chest.

A scream erupted from his throat, but there was no pain, no sensation of claws penetrating his innards. As he stared down in shock, color drained from his vision, and he found himself drifting out of his body to behold the elevator cabin from above. A line of text appeared before his eyes.

He swore and reached up to his face to slide up his headset. Blinking at the light of his living room, he found his buddy Josh watching him with a broad grin.

"I told you DeepImmersion mode hits different," Josh said smugly. "That the best you can do? Give that thing here and let me show you how it's done."

"Not yet," he growled, lowering the headset. "I can do this."
