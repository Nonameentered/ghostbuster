Sunlight filtered through the sand-scuffed panels of the dome, shining down on the crowd. The town's entire population of three hundred and twelve gathered for Vlad's inauguration. The town used to be called Mars Prime, but over the years, it became known simply as the town. Names became unnecessary after the asteroid crashed into Earth and made this the last inhabited place in existence.

There wasn't much pomp to the ceremony. Vlad's predecessor had passed away, so it was the brusque sheriff who placed the lanyard with the access card onto his neck. Vlad made vague promises of a better future, which he suspected the threadbare denizens knew to be empty words. His gaze roved the crowd as he spoke until he spied Dorothy. She blanched and ducked her head. She had rebuffed his advances before, but now that he was mayor, he would take her for a wife, and they both knew it.

"We will persevere," he said in conclusion. "As we always have."

There was some halfhearted applause. Vlad descended from the stage that had been used to host concerts in long-forgotten times. Some people approached to offer congratulations or clap him on his back, but most kept a respectful distance. From the moment that card was placed around his neck, he decided who lived and who died, who was allowed to have children and who was not. It was the only way to survive on the meager yield of hydroponics and recycled oxygen.

Come night, he made the traditional journey to the observation deck, as his predecessor had before him. Perhaps a hundred people gathered around the locked door, murmuring and whispering to each other. As Vlad approached, they parted before him and watched in tense silence as he lifted his access card and touched it to the keypad.

With a faint beep the door slid open, releasing a whiff of stale air. He nodded somberly to the people and stepped through, allowing the door to close behind him.

A large telescope dominated the room. The only light came from yellowish strips along the control console, the glass dome above shielded by an aluminum shell. Vlad fumbled with the controls, causing the shell to retract with a grind of protest. He gasped at how clear the night sky was; these panels were the only ones not yet scratched to cloudiness by the sandstorms.

Returning to the controls, he set the targeting system to Earth. His excitement mounted as the telescope whirred and turned, seeking out the planet their predecessors had come from. Then it was done.

With bated breath, Vlad bent over the eyehole. For a long moment, he couldn't comprehend what he was seeing. Then he hissed in a breath. Orange-and-brown clouds covered large swaths of the planet, but underneath he saw green and blue. What's more, on the night side of the planet, there were *lights*.

He reeled back from the telescope, his chest heaving with rapid breaths. The technicians still maintained the two Orion launch vehicles with religious devotion. If the people learned of this, they would insist on trying for Earth, no matter the risk. Even to those born after the cataclysm, it was the lost home they were eventually meant to return to.

Vlad ran a palm over his face and realized his hands were shaking. He couldn't tell them. Here he was a ruler. Up there, if they even made the flight, he would be no one at all.

He shut off the targeting system and raised the protective shell.  Schooling his expression, he opened the door. A hundred pale, gaunt faces met him.

"What did you see, mayor?" asked an old woman, her eyes alive with forlorn hope.

"Dust," he said gruffly. "Dust clouds and magma. Nothing up there but death."

A desolate sigh escaped the mouths of the gathered, and they began to disperse. Vlad watched them grimly, the image of the healing blue-and-green planet bright in his mind's eye. They couldn't know. Never.
