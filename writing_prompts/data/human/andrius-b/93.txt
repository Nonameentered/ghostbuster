It was seventy-nine days, thirty hours and twenty minutes after Master expired that the visitors came, a man and a woman. Cork recognized them as Master's associates and let them inside. Were he human, he might have felt anger at them not being with his Master during the last days of her life, but such feelings were beyond him. If he felt anything at all, it was the drive to see his task through.

"Master's body is preserved downstairs," he said in an even voice. "Excuse me, I must see to the experiments."

The visitors exchanged a glance and descended into the basement. Cork returned to the worktables and turned down the heat under a bubbling vial of purple liquid. As it cooled, it slowly turned into a greyish sludge. Another failure. His efficient motions betrayed no irritation as he noted down the outcome. This was but another data point on the road to understanding.

After a time, the visitors returned and watched him work.

"What are you doing?" the woman asked.

"Research," Cork said. Something in his mechanical mind stopped him from elaborating. They may not approve, and there was nothing more important than his task.

The woman gave the man a watery smile. "Vivian always said it was a capable assistant. One of her best creations."

Cork said nothing, but the clockwork gears in his guts whirred louder for a few seconds.

"How long have you been... researching?" the man asked. "No, that's a stupid question. How long will you keep at it?"

Cork swiveled his mechanical head toward him. "As long as I continue to function."

The man shook his head. "Vivian's dead. She's *gone*! Do you understand, automaton?"

Cork looked at him unblinkingly. "I understand. I was present when Master expired."

The man reeled back as if struck. The woman patted his shoulder sympathetically.

"Vivian wouldn't have wanted you to waste your time on experiments that no longer matter," she said softly. "You can stop now... rest."

"Master gave me a task," Cork said.

The woman's lip trembled, and her eyes misted with tears. Cork could not understand the reason for her distress. Picking up the vial, he set to disposing of it in the kiln. The visitors conferred, not bothering to lower their voices.

"We can't leave Vivian like this," the man was saying. "We have to give her a proper burial."

Cork straightened up from the kiln and pivoted around. "No."

The man scowled. "She must have a proper send-off. You can keep playing in her laboratory, automaton, but we're taking her body with us."

"No," Cork said, coming closer. "Master must not be allowed to rot in the ground."

The man scowled and opened his mouth, but the woman spoke first. "I'll seal the house with my magic. Carve a nice tombstone before it. Vivian wouldn't have minded being buried this way, I'm sure."

The man bit his lip, then nodded. Cork escorted them through the door and closed it gently, unaffected by their pitying glances. He returned to the worktable to set up another experiment, barely registering the rumble of magic that entombed Master's house. He needed no air, food, or water, and the laboratory was stocked with all the equipment and ingredients he would need. He did not have Master's clever mind, but he had patience.

One day, Master would live again.
