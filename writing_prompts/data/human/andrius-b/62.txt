He squeezed in through the closing door and plopped down on n empty seat, panting from his run. An old woman several seats to his right sniffed disapprovingly before returning to her book. He smiled as the train jolted into motion. *Made it*.

His gaze landed on a pair of dainty shoes under a frilly hem of a dress so long it nearly brushed the grimy floor. He looked up, his eyebrows climbing his forehead. The dress was resplendent with frills, with long wide sleeves and a flared skirt that draped over the nearby seats. Its owner was the palest woman he had ever seen, with midnight-black hair held back by a—snood, he thought it was called—and cool grey eyes.

And she was staring back at him.

His cheeks heated up, and he quickly averted his gaze. How long had he been staring? He couldn't tell. In his defense, she did make for a peculiar sight. Was this historical reenactment? Cosplay?

The train stopped at the next station, and more people rushed in. He risked a glance across and instantly found himself pinpointed by a pair of grey eyes. He held eye contact for a moment, captivated by her doll-like features, then wrenched his gaze away. 

The train resumed moving. He shifted in his seat, still feeling her gaze on him. What a strange woman. Stranger yet, none of the other passengers seemed to be paying her any attention. 

Swallowing, he pretended to read the advertisement above her head and hazarded another peek. *God*, she was still staring. Was she angry? He couldn't tell. Her face remained cool and emotionless, and he could have sworn she hadn't blinked once. 

He pulled out his phone and stared down at the screen. From the corner of his eye, he saw her stand and approach him, her skirt swishing about her feet. He backed into his seat and stubbornly kept his gaze lowered until she stooped over him, casting a shadow over the screen.

Unable to take it any longer, he looked up. Her face was uncomfortably close, her eyes scrutinizing him unblinkingly.

"C-can I help you?" he asked.

Her brow knitted in the first display of emotion he had seen. "You can see me?" Her voice was soft and even.

"Well, sure. Can't everyone?" He chuckled nervously, then clammed up. The other passengers seemed to be sending him wary looks.

She shook her head slightly, her eyes never leaving his face. There was something so odd about her, so out-of-place in the dingy subway, that he couldn't help taking her seriously.

Mustering his courage, he addressed the old woman to his right. "Excuse me."

She faced him reluctantly. "Yes?"

"Do you see a lady in a black dress?" he asked, tipping his chin before him.

The old woman stared at him in silence, then rose and shuffled to the front of the car. The nearest passengers sidled away, muttering under their breaths. He groaned softly and rubbed his forehead. What an inconvenient timing to go insane. 

The lady in black considered him for a moment and sat down beside him. He sidled one seat away. She followed without a word. He opened his mouth, then closed it. Best not acknowledge her.

Another stop. More passengers filtered in, and the car filled up, but no one acknowledged the strange lady, and neither did they attempt to sit beside him. How odd. If she wasn't real, he expected someone to take her seat. He closed his eyes and screwed up his face.

"What are you doing?" the hallucination asked.

He winced. "Trying to make you disappear."

She was silent for a moment. "Do you possess such a power?"

He snorted at the seriousness of her questing, then squeezed his eyes shut and focused some more. Cracking one eye open, he peeked at her. "Apparently not."

She nodded wistfully. "I didn't think so. It would've been convenient, though."

"Convenient?" he asked, unable to hold back his curiosity. "How so?"

"I've been around for a long time, and I haven't found a way to disappear yet."

He shivered at the melancholy in her voice. She didn't sound sad so much as detached. *Resigned*. 

The train stopped once more, and people left and got on. She kept peering at him, her delicate hands clasped in her lap.

"Mine's the next stop," he said quietly.

"That's a shame." She lowered her head, breaking eye contact for the first time. "I haven't met anyone who could see me for a while."

He drummed his fingers against the seat. "Oh, what the hell," he muttered. As the train began to slow, he stood, wiped his sweaty hands on his shirt, and held one out. It somehow seemed appropriate. "Will you come with me? I'll at least hear you out."

She raised her head and blinked in surprise. For a moment, he thought she wouldn't take his hand, but then a smile curved her lips, and she laid her hand in his. "Thank you."
