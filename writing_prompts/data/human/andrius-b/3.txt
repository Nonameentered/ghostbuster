The war room in the High Keep of Adenar housed an enormous ornamented table atop which lay a map of the city and its environs, cluttered with tin figures representing the defenders and the surrounding enemy. Captain Surly had been explaining troop positions and angles of fire and whatnot, but I was so busy being terrified out of my wits that it just went in one ear and out the other. 

In my defense, I wasn't suited for military strategy. Or command in general. Or much at all, really. It's just that all the suitable men had gotten themselves killed throughout the long siege. So, because my mother was the sister to the baroness of the land, here I was, frowning at the map and pretending I knew what I was doing.

Can you tell what my best quality is yet? That's right: I'm a realist. And after Captain Surly led me through an inspection of our defenses this morning and I saw the weary faces of the soldiers and the dwindling supplies, I knew that it was only a matter of time before the city was lost. We had to lay down our weapons and open the gates. It was the only way our lives would be spared.

"Lord Alfonso?" Captain Surly said, his sharp eyes peering at me from under his bushy eyebrows. 

I twitched. "Er, very good. Proceed, captain."

"That was the end of my report," Captain Surly said with a note of irritation.

"Uh, yes, of course. Forgive me, I was lost in thought." I cracked a smile but received only a scowl in return. "Thinking about troop positioning and whatnot."

"Excellent, my lord," Captain Surly said. "And what are your insights?"

I could feel myself break into a sweat as I bent over the map and furrowed my brow. My only insight was that we had to surrender as soon as possible. The trouble with that was that Adenar's citizens were a remarkably stubborn lot. The past three years had seen several collaborators hanged. If I made known my intention to surrender, I would be hanging from the gallows within the hour.

*A breach*, I suddenly thought, staring at the map. If one of the walls was to be overwhelmed by the enemy, they could pour into the city unabated. Who could blame me then for trying to spare the soldiers? A single breach, and I would have the justification needed to raise the white flag. 

"Withdraw a third of the soldiers from the battlementsâ€”and on the eastern wall, leave only a skeleton garrison," I said, looking at the highest concentration of enemy troops on the map. "They're to wait in reserve."

Captain Surly's eyebrows rose. "My lord?"

"You heard me, captain," I said, crossing my arms to hide the shaking of my hands. "I have a feeling the enemy might try... something. We have to be prepared."

"A *feeling*?" he said. "My lord, should the enemy send their siege towers to the eastern wall, the city will fall."

"The siege towers are slow, lumbering machines," I said disdainfully. "Should that happen, the reserves will reach the wall in time."

Although clearly unhappy, Captain Surly saluted and turned to an aide by the door to send out the orders. I slowly exhaled and wiped my hands on my trousers. *Now we wait*.
