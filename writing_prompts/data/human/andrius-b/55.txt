Curtis awoke with a gasp. He lay on a bone-white beach by a black sea under a night sky that looked nothing like the one back home. There was no pain, even though his last memory was of screaming as he was pierced by a spear. He stood with a jangle of armor and wasn't surprised to find Death watching him.

Her pale face was framed by raven-black hair, and her eyes were dark and sad. She wore a black dress that fluttered in an unseen wind. Her bare feet left no imprints on the sand as she came closer.

"You're here. *Again*." Her mellifluous voice held a note of exasperation. "I told you to treasure your life, yet look at how mangled you are."

"That is the fate of a soldier."

She touched his bloodied chest. "Not all soldiers die young. What were you thinking, charging into the enemy lines alone?"

"Had anyone asked me then, I would have said I was protecting my comrades." He laid his hand over hers. "But deep down, I might have been hoping to meet you again."

A blush tinged her cheeks, and she hurriedly freed her hand. "You fool. My task is to guide souls like yours to the Beyond. We can't be together but for these brief moments in between."

"Yet I treasure these moments more than anything." He reached under his tabard and smiled in relief. The rose was still there, albeit a little crushed and soaked with blood. "This is for you."

Death accepted the blossom with both hands. "It's beautiful," she whispered.

"Not as beautiful as you."

She sent him a startled glance, then looked away, her cheeks positively glowing. "You're incorrigible. Haven't you been listening to anything I said?"

"I don't care. Nothing will sway my heart."

She contemplated him and sighed. "One more time. I'm sending you back *one more time*. Accept your medals, retire to some peaceful little village, and live there till you're ninety."

He reached for her in alarm. "But I don't want to go back. I want to stay with you—"

"Die before your time again, and I shall hurl you to the word of the living before you can blink." She clasped his hand with her cool one and softened her voice. "I won't accept you coming back here. Not before you've lived a long, fulfilling life."

"Wait, does that mean—"

Death let go of his hand and glided out of reach. Wind tore through the beach, raising a cloud of sand that swallowed Curtis and carried him skyward. 

Death admired the rose in her hand, then looked around as if to see if anyone was watching. Tucking the rose into her hair, she giggled and skipped away along the beach.
