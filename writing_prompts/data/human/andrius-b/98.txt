Reginald was in a conundrum.


It wasn't the identity of the assassins that concerned him; gleaning anything from the charred corpses would be difficult, but that was a headache for the spymaster. It wasn't even that it had been Her Majesty who put them in such a state, nor the mystery of why she had briefly grown a tail and a pair of wings.


No, what worried him was that he could still see the aforementioned wings bulging against the back of Her Majesty's gown as she comforted the stunned king—and the guards, busy as they were with dragging off the corpses, were only a stray glance away from seeing them too. A good butler anticipated his master's desires, and since Her Majesty had never revealed her... attributes before, she clearly desired to keep them secret.


Reginald sidled to block the guards' line of sight and tried to catch Her Majesty's eye, but alas, she had leaned in to speak to the king. Worse yet, a group of advisors rushed into the throne room through the far entrance, no doubt eager to show off their loyalty and condemn the attack.


Now, Reginald could have spoken up and faced no reproval, but in his eyes, such a thing just wasn't done. A good butler blended into the background, only responding when called for.


Such a conundrum called for special measures. He lifted his white-gloved hand and coughed into it with a  carrying sound perfected by decades of service.


The queen looked up sharply and pierced him with a slit-pupil gaze that would have made a lesser man quake. Her expression softened as she recognized him. "By the gods, Reginald, I'd forgotten you were here! You weren't hurt, were you?"


"Not at all," he said. "Forgive me, Your Majesty, but your dress appears to be in a disarray. Shall I fetch you a cloak?"


"My dress?" The queen's brow furrowed in confusion before she followed his gaze over her shoulder. A gasp escaped her lips, and the wings vanished with a rustle. She faced him and lowered her voice. "Reginald—I must ask that you keep what you saw here a secret."


"You don't need to worry," His Majesty interjected, sending him a fond gaze. His face was still pale, but his voice was steady. "Reginald has been with me since I was but a boy. I'd trust him with my life."


"Thank you for the kind words, Your Majesty," Reginald said, his already straight posture assuming an almost military sharpness. "Is there anything I can do for you? A calming drink, perhaps?"


The queen licked her faintly sooty lips. "All this fuss made me hungry. How about an early dinner?" A blush colored her cheeks when the king barked a laugh. "Shush, you."


"A rare steak, perchance?" Reginald said.


The queen flashed him a row of too-sharp teeth. "Exactly what I was thinking."


Reginald bowed, pleased at having anticipated correctly, and excused himself. A man prone to senseless woolgathering might have recalled the legends of dragons who were said to have fled persecution by taking on human forms. Such a man might even have pondered why it was that Her Majesty hadn't seemed to age a day since the king had taken her as a wife. But Reginald was a butler, and a good one at that, so he only made a mental note to replace the carpets in the throne room and to tell the kitchens to stock up on red meat.
