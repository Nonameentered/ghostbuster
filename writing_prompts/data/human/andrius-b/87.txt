Xander swept his gaze over the runic array one last time, took a deep breath, and started the chant. The harsh words echoed as if repeated by thousands of unseen tongues, and the runes skittered over the worn stone of his tower like inky spiderwebs. His heart beat faster, not in fear but exhilaration.

Some of his fellow wizards called him insane; others, greedy. For all he knew, he might've been the former, but never the latter. It wasn't riches he sought, nor power for the sake of lording over others. No, what drove him was the simple desire to learn the truth of the world.

The chant kept building toward a crescendo. Xander was but a conduit to the magic and couldn't have stopped even if he wanted to. The last word fell resoundingly from his lips, and in a profound silence that followed, the very space above the center of the array warped and split to reveal something blacker than the blackest night.

Xander forgot to breathe as he leaned closer. Something stirred in that blackness, something with myriads of eyes and barbed feelers and mouths that whispered dark secrets. And it looked back at him, and it spoke in a voice that scraped the insides of his skull.

"Why do you interrupt my slumber, son of man?"

Xander's eyes bled as he struggled to catch glimpses of the unfathomable form. "*Beautiful*," he whispered.

The feelers squirmed, and color tinged the being's faces—all hundred-odd of them. "What do you hope to achieve with your strange words? Speak your demands as others did before you."

Xander swayed under the strength of the voice. "I only wished to see what lay below the foundations of the world," he said. "And you're everything I hoped for and more."

The being was silent for a time. "You are the strangest human I have encountered. What is your name?"

He barked a laugh and choked on his blood. "Xander," he said, wiping his lips with a trembling hand. "I have been called strange, but never by an Outer God. Is that what you are?"

"I have as many names as there have been civilizations. If you must, call me Sheshup." The being's many eyes bore into him. "The way you're leaking fluids from your orifices is fascinating."

"It seems my body isn't fit to behold your greatness, Sheshup." He sniffled and gave a bloody grin. "But I'm glad to amuse you in my last moments."

The countless eyes blinked, and a tentacle stretched from the blackness toward him. Xander staggered closer, half-expecting it to pull him in, but it only wiped the blood off his upper lip with curious gentleness.

"I have comprehended your form," Sheshup said. "Step back."

He shuffled back and caught himself against the wall. Blackness poured from the rift and shaped itself into a figure of a woman: bones first, then muscle, and lastly pale alabaster skin and midnight-black hair whose every strand seemed to possess a life of its own. He  exhaled in admiration.

Sheshup turned toward him, and a smile curved her lips. "A constraining form," she remarked in a voice that longer made his ears bleed, "but not without its charms."

Xander tried to speak, but broke into a coughing fit. "Why?" he choked out.

Sheshup glided closer and supported him by the shoulders. Her eyes were pure black, and he felt that if he stared into them too long, he would lose himself—and not in a poetic sense. "I never felt the desire to walk the material planes before, but you seem to have the potential to stave off my eternal boredom." A faint blush tinged her cheeks. "Does the prospect of my company displease you?"

"Never," he croaked, clutching her cold hand. "I shall dedicate my life to showing you everything our world has to offer."

Sheshup smiled a smile with too many teeth. "Then I shall make sure it will be a long one."

The secluded tower lay abandoned until another wizard dropped by and discovered remnants of a spell that made his hair stand on end. Countless inquisitors were sent in pursuit, but none ever returned. And throughout the lands, a cautionary tale spread: if you meet a strange wizard and a woman with eyes black like the night, never cross them lest you not live to see the morning.
