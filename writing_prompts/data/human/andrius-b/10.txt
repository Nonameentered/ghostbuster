Grug must go to stars. Grug climb tree. Tree break and Grug fall. Back hurt very much, but Grug live. Tribe bring meat. Grug heal. Grug find larger tree. Climb and reach up, but stars too far. Tribe laugh.

Grug see mountain in distance. Grug dress in fur and climb mountain. Alone because tribe afraid. Fingers bleed and very cold, but Grug not die. Climb mountain and reach up, but stars still too far. Grug scream.

Grug come down from mountain and think for many days. Need higher place. Maybe Grug make own mountain.

Grug gather rock and make mountain. Many summer pass. Mountain too small. Grug scream and break mountain. Then Grug sad and gather rock again.

New tribe come to Grug. They talk funny and do strange things. They burn forest and put seeds into ground and gather them when they grow.

Grug is excited. Grug wants to teach his tribe, but when he goes to the old place, he only finds bones. His tribe returned to earth. Only he is different. Grug cries.

Grug can't find his tribe, but he finds others. He teaches them to burn the forest and plant good seeds. Those that learn grow large and strong. They follow Grug.

Grug tells them to build a mountain tall enough to reach the stars. Many tribes gather to help. They think Grug wants to reach the gods. Grug lets them believe what they want.

A hundred men sweat piling stone upon stone. Work is slow, but Grug is patient. Every night he climbs to the top and tries to reach the stars, but they're still too far.

One day the top of the mountain collapses, and a falling rock crushes two men. The chieftains spit at Grug and say he will never reach the gods. Grug runs with tears in his eyes. 

He wanders the land. He meets many people and discovers many things. The wheel, the plow, new crops. Grug thinks. He doesn't know how to reach the stars, but maybe someone else will. More food means more people who have time to think about something else besides getting food.

He learns everything that is good and teaches others. Countless years pass. Tribes grow large from rich harvests and settle down and build cities of stone. People learn to put words on clay so they're never lost.

Things start to move at a dizzying pace. Cities become countries, and countries become sprawling empires, with rolling fields of wheat and great libraries of knowledge. Grug hopes he can reach the stars soon.

The progress speeds upâ€”accelerates. There are new words, new inventions, new knowledge, not every hundred years, but every fifty, ten, five. Reaching the stars turns out to be much harder than he imagined, but humanity's ingenuity, once freed from the shackles of hunger and poverty, is up to the task.

Grug is no longer a teacher. As humanity's knowledge fills book after book, he finds it impossible to keep up. That's all right, though. Knowledge is just one part of the equation. There's also wealth and sheer will to keep pushing forward, and he has those in spades.

When the first rocket lands on the Moon, when the first man sets foot on its dusty surface and the staticky broadcast reaches the Earth, Grug shivers. The deep satisfaction eclipses that of his first hunt in the savannah so very long ago.

Even so, he knows it's but a start.

Grug peers through an observation window inside a space habitat that is home to millions. He stands at the leading edge of humanity's expansion wave. Behind him, laser highways criss-cross the Milky Way, pushing starships between billions of colonized worlds. Ahead, the distant stars of Canis Major galaxy shine at him. Distant, but closer than ever before.

A brilliant beam of light pierces the void, and the window dims to protect his eyes. The laser beam stretches toward a star in the intergalactic void, the first of the many hops on the way to the new galaxy. Constructor ships will go first to build a relay station and send the beam to another rogue star, and so on, and so forth. It will take hundreds of thousands of years, but eventually, a pathway will connect the two galaxies.

A thunderous cheer erupts. He turns around and smiles at the crowd. Several hundred thousand people are gathered here, and unseen cameras are broadcasting to billions more within the star system. Some resemble him in shape, others not at all. Most are ageless, through advances of science and not quirks of fate, although they are all children compared to him.

A tall and handsome man approaches him and bows. Grug cares not for formality, but he knows it's futile to object.

"Forefather," the man says respectfully, "what will you do now?"

The crowd falls silent. Billions are watching him on their screens. Untold quintillions will witness this moment eons later as the radio signal travels across the galaxy.

"Grug go to stars," he says with a wry grin.

The crowd erupts in cheers. He turns his back to them and extends his hand toward the stars of another galaxy. They're finally within reach.
