From the time he was a snot-nosed brat, Bron spent every free minute at the village's smithy, captivated by the rhythmic hammering, flying sparks, and the hiss of the red-hot iron being quenched. So when he came to the temple for his coming-of-age ceremony, it came as no surprise that the Smith God bestowed upon him his blessing. He was brought to the Sacred Forge in the capital—what better shrine to the god of blacksmiths than a forge—and put to work alongside the other acolytes.

Tirelessly they toiled, producing wondrous devices, clever mechanisms, and peerless weapons. To Bron, there was no greater happiness. Each time he lifted his hammer, he would call upon his god, and divine inspiration would guide his hand to shape the metal and hammer out its impurities.

Then war came, and the Sacred Forge was tasked with producing swords and spears and more horrible weapons. A fresh acolyte carelessly left a container of naphtha by the furnace, and when Bron rushed in to take it away, it exploded and knocked him unconscious. When he awoke, he found that he had lost most of his arm.

He brooded, wandering the Sacred Forge by day and dreaming of wielding his hammer by night. He sat, he figured, and he sketched with a piece of coal on paper, and then he threw the sketch into the fire and started anew. 

The acolytes stared when he walked into the forge months later. Bron heated an ingot in the furnace, set it onto the anvil, and picked up his hammer in his left hand. He prayed to the Smith God as he had countless times, but no divine power filled his remaining limb. He ducked his head and stood there for a long time, and the acolytes would later say that that had been the only time anyone saw him cry.

Then he raised his hammer, inhaled the sweltering air, and struck.

He toiled for a day and a night, and the acolytes watched and murmured in shock at his creation: an arm with steel bones and silver nerves and brass skin. Before the metal had cooled, he attached it to his stump and roared in agony as he riveted it to his flesh, and after he was done, he passed out where he stood.

Once he came to, he was told he was no longer welcome at the Sacred Forge, for he had lost the god's blessing. Bron saw the horror in their eyes and did not argue. Gathering his meager possessions, he left the capital and walked until he stumbled upon a secluded valley. There he built himself a forge, and since he slept and ate in it, it became his home too.

Attracted by the noise of hammering, the peasants came, and although they eyed his metallic arm with fear, they were happy to barter for nails and horseshoes. Hunters came for arrowheads and knives. Then came the son of the lord, and after Bron forged him a sword, people said there was no finer blade in the land.

As his fame grew, visitors from across the land streamed to the valley and vied for his attention. Some begged him to teach them, and recalling his boyhood, Bron did so. His forge grew to sprawl over the valley, and even during the rare moments when his hammer was resting, those of his apprentices pounded on.

Years passed, and his lungs, damaged by fumes and heat, began to rattle and wheeze. Bron sat and figured and sketched, and then he fired up his forge and crafted himself new lungs from a pair of bellows. When his vision began to fade, he replaced his eyes with a pair of polished gemstones. And when his heart started to stutter, he fashioned one after a furnace, and its beats thrummed through the entire valley. His apprentices bowed low to him, and visitors from afar brought him tribute and prostrated themselves.

In the faraway capital, the furnaces of the Sacred Forge lay cold. And the name the blacksmiths of the land called upon as they swung their hammers was that of Bron.
