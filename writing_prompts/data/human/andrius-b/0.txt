Come morning, the princess took one look in the mirror and declared that she needed her hair brushed. When Ruldrim produced a bejeweled comb from his hoard, she scoffed and explained that princesses needed ladies-in-waiting to brush their hair for them. He sighed, grabbed a clawful of gold, and winged his way to the town, not even pausing to question his obeisance.

Days passed, and new furniture and servants appeared in his lair, while his precious hoard dwindled before his eyes. Still the princess persisted with her demands. Ruldrim hoped the knights would come soon. Deep down, he was even prepared to throw the battle just to be rid of her.

Such were his thoughts as he lay in the only corner not yet taken up by ornamental rugs and soft divans that Annabelle insisted were vital to her survival. He morosely watched the princess eat grapes atop one of the aforementioned divans when an unfamiliar boy approached him and bowed.

"Master Ruldrim," he said politely. "Her Highness requests your presence."

Ruldrim stared at him, then at the princess, who lounged just a dozen paces away. "She's right there! And who are you supposed to be, anyway?"

"I'm Her Highness's page," the boy said proudly. "It wouldn't be proper for a Princess of the Realm to come calling on her own."

Ruldrim snorted out a streak of flames, causing him to jump back with a yelp. Humans and their ridiculous customs! He rose and extended his neck toward the princess.

"Drimmy!" she exclaimed, handing her unfinished bowl of grapes to a maid. "Just who I wanted to see. I'm bored."

"And?" he asked irritably.

"I told you he was somewhat slow," she whispered conspiratorially to the maid. "Bring me a jester."

Ruldrim took a deep breath. "I shall not."

"Perhaps you didn't understand," she said slowly. "I wish to be amused."

"Oh, I understood perfectly. There will be no more amusements, no flowers, and no cakes until I get at least one good battle out of you!" He released a cloud of smoke. "Are your knights even coming, or have your brothers abandoned you for being so insufferable?"

Annabelle's bottom lip trembled, and she burst into tears. The ladies-in-waiting rushed in to comfort her, shooting him dirty looks. Ruldrim shrank back despite himself.

"Th-they must be busy ruling the kingdom," she sobbed. "But perhaps we can remind them of my plight."

"Remind them?"

She dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief. "If you were to fly over the kingdom and give them a scare, they would surely send a squad of knights to fight you."

Ruldrim found himself nodding; that was the first sensible idea that had come from her mouth. "Yes," he rumbled, rising to his full height. "Yes, I shall do just that!"

"Wait!" the princess cried. "Take me with you. I know which provinces have the strongest knights. Let's start with Duke Ashswiftâ€”his champion won the last year's jousting tournament."

That was all Ruldrim needed to hear. So excited was he at the prospect of fighting a jousting champion that he bent his neck and allowed the princess to climb onto his back without complaint. He crawled out from his lair and swiftly took to the skies. 

"Not so fast!" the princess yelled, slapping his neck. "I'll fall."

Ruldrim swallowed back his irritation and slowed his ascent.

"That way!" She nudged him with her heels as if he were a common horse. "Left, go left, you silly beast!" 

He gritted his teeth and turned as she ordered. Just a little longer, he told himself, and it would all be worth it. For a time, they flew in the direction of the setting sun. The forests underneath were replaced by a grassy plain, then rolling hills.

"There!" she cried, pointing at a sprawling mansion atop a hill. "That's Duke Ashswift's summer residence. If you burn his prized rose garden, that will surely send a message!"

Ruldrim stilled his wings and glided down toward the mansion. Once directly overhead, he took a deep breath and spewed a torrent of flames at the garden, torching rosebushes and ornamented benches alike. Screams rang in the mansion, and guards spilled onto the grounds, gaping up at at him. Annabelle clapped and laughed gleefully.

"That'll teach Rosaline to boast about her roses," she said.

Ruldrim contorted his neck to stare at her with one eye. "What?"

"Don't worry your scaly head about it," she said, patting his neck. "I'm sure the Duke's knights will be rushing to your lair. Now fly me back, I'm in the mood for cake."

Ruldrim sighed and winged home, hoping against hope that she was right.
