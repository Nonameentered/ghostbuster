The heart-shaped ruby atop the magic wand that lay on the coffee table flashed red. "I sense an Incursion. Your strength is needed, Ichika!"

Sprawled on the couch, Ichika grimaced and lowered her phone. "Seriously? Now? I was this close to drawing a rare—"

"People are in need of your help," the wand said with indignation. "Fill your heart with courage and fight!"

"Damn it." Tossing the phone aside, she groaned and stretched her arms above her head. "All right, Shiny, let's get to it."

"We've been over this, Ichika," the wand chided.

"Ugh, fine." Grabbing the wand, she deadpanned, "Shining Heart, give me strength."

The wand was silent, its ruby blinking urgently.

Ichika sighed exasperatedly. "Do we really have"—she spun around—"to do this"—she leaped forward—"every damn time?" Raising the obstinate wand toward the ceiling, she cried, "Shining Heart, give me strength! You bastard."

Bright lights erupted around her, but she had gone through this enough times to close her eyes before it could blind her. A sudden breeze caressed her skin as her comfy blouse vanished to be replaced by a frilly dress so short that a regular person wearing it would be arrested for public indecency.

Once the lights faded, she cracked open her eyes and looked around warily. At least there were no flower petals this time; those had been a bitch to clean.

Smoothing down her skirt in a habitual gesture, she walked up to the window and flung it open. With a last weary glance at her windswept apartment, she took flight, rising quickly over the drab apartment buildings of the district. Sirens blared in the distance, and Shining Heart thrummed in her hand, granting her an instinctual sense of where the Incursion had occurred. 

She smelled the monster before she saw it—the stench of the sewers, rotting and vile. Police cars rushed toward the incident, and officers were evacuating people from the streets. Everyone looked up at her passing and cheered. 

Perverts, she thought even as she forced herself to smile and wave. Fortunately, Shiny's magic prevented anyone from seeing up her absurdly short skirt—just barely. The wand had some incomprehensible ideas about how magical girls ought to be.

Noises of shattering glass and panicked shouts drifted to her ears. She rounded a corner and saw the monster. Four stories tall, it resembled some unholy cross between a slug and an octopus and stank accordingly. Its countless limbs were overturning police cars and lashing at the officers as the monster slithered toward the water cannon that was barely holding it at bay.

"Always with the tentacles," she muttered in disgust.

Schooling her expression, she descended to the group of policemen clustered around the water canon. Their faces shone with hope and admiration when they saw her. She resisted the urge to tug down her skirt.

"Thank god you're here," exclaimed the sergeant. "We've trying to hold it back, but—"

"I'll take care of it." Realizing she had been too brusque, she clutched her wand in both hands and widened her eyes earnestly. "You just evacuate the civilians, sir. Fighting those things is my mission."

The sergeant's heartfelt reply died in her ears as she soared back into the air. The monster was lashing its tentacles at everything in sight as the stream of water splashed against its thick skin. 

"How admirable, Ichika!" Shining Heart exclaimed. "You often talk callously, yet you truly care for the people."

"Whatever," she muttered, approaching the monster. Inhaling deeply, she yelled, "Stop right there! I won't forgive you for destroying our precious city!"

The monster turned its slimy eyes up at her and gave a burbling laugh. "I knew you would come if I raised a ruckus, foolish girl. Now taste my tentacles!"

A dozen tentacles surged toward her, much faster than their earlier ungainly movements. Ichika swore and swerved aside, shuddering in disgust as the slimy tip of a tentacle brushed her bare arm. Stupid useless costume.

"Don't think I'll let you do as you please!" she cried for the benefit of the spectators. "My magic will wipe you away!" Evading another tentacle, she twirled her wand dramatically. "This spell is powered by the feelings of everyone in the city! Divine sparkling beam! 

A violently pink beam erupted from the ruby atop her wand and hit the monster squarely in the head, yet it only staggered back and raised its tentacles again.

"Everyone's feelings?" it burbled. "What a joke! It didn't even sting, huhuhu!"

"Oh no," Ichika said loudly, "what am I going to do?"

"We must raise our sync rate!" Shining Heart said. "Reach deep inside your heart for that seed of courage! Think of the smiles of everyone you want to protect—"

"Yeah, yeah," Ichika said, and stuffed the wand under her skirt. Dimensional storage was one of the few real perks of her costume. Darting over the monster, she flew the way it had come from, purposely keeping her speed low.

"Running away?" the monster mocked. "The chase will make the prize all the sweeter, huhuhu."

Ichika shuddered and rolled to avoid another attack. The creature burbled in excitement as it pursued her, leaving a trail of slime along the cracked street. She reached a crossroads and looked around in feigned panic. The narrow alley to the right was empty and barricaded off at its end. Perfect.

She landed in its middle and planted her feet firmly. The monster sloshed its way toward her. It towered over her and took up almost the entire width of the street. 

"Giving up? Maybe you're not as foolish as you look. Let me play with you, huhuhu."

A smirk rose to her lips. "Sure," she said, stooping to reach under her skirt, "let's play."

The monster's eyes bulged out as she produced her Howa Type 96 grenade launcher and heaved the barrel level with its slimy bulk. She squeezed the trigger and gritted her teeth as the weapon belched out a series of belt-fed grenades, kicking powerfully in her arms. Slime splattered the surrounding buildings as the monster was blasted apart.

"W-what kind of magical girl uses guns?" it screamed, shielding its oozing front with its tentacles.

Ichika snorted and kicked off into the skies. "The kind that gets the job done," she said, aiming squarely at its head. "Divine beam, my frilly ass."

Grinning viciously, she squeezed the trigger and didn't let up until all that remained of the monster was a steaming crater. The silence when she stopped firing was deafening. Exhaling, she landed beside the crater and stowed the Howa Type 96 away. The whirring of a helicopter reached her ears, and more sirens. She smoothed down her dress and drew her wand.

"Ichika, we're meant to be partners," Shining Heart said, flashing red. "Why won't you wield me?"

"I would if you had something stronger than a pretty lightshow." She brushed back her hair and grimaced when she encountered a gob of smile. "Clean me up, won't you?"

"There's nothing stronger than friendship and love," Shiny said hotly even as a faint light surrounded her.

"My best friend Howa says otherwise." 

Shiny huffed and went silent. Ichika glanced up at the nearing press helicopter and straightened up from her slouch. Cars screeched to a halt at either end of the alley, and the battleground was swiftly surrounded by a crowd held back by a ring of policemen. Ichika waved and tried not to wince at the flashes of the cameras.

"It was a powerful monster," she proclaimed, clasping her hands over her chest, "but I was able to defeat it thanks to everyone cheering me on."

A cheer rose from the crowd. Ichika preened a little. As much as she hated her work, this part wasn't entirely bad.

"Ichika," Shiny chided, "it's not good to lie—"

"Be quiet," she hissed, clasping her hand over the ruby. She smiled at the crowd and scuffed her shoe against the street. "It was everyone's feelings... and my love for this city."

The crowd cheered louder. Ichika waved, kicked off into the skies, and allowed herself a weary groan. She needed a nice soak in a bath, and Shiny was going into the back of a drawer for the foreseeable future.
