Jack plunged his shovel into the packed soil and lifted it, causing dirt to crumble down down the slope. The bare light bulb now hanged several yards behind him, a testament to his progress. Truth be told, he didn't *need* a larger cellar, but several hours of digging always left his muscles burning and his mind blissfully empty.

He thrust his shovel again and paused in surprise when he didn't encounter as much resistance as before. He fumbled for his flashlight and turned it on. A small hole had opened in the soil ahead.

Frowning, he brought the flashlight closer. Beyond was a tunnel with earthen walls reinforced with timber, with a wire running along the ceiling. He was no engineer, but this looked like no utility line. More than anything, it reminded him of bootleggers' tunnels of the Prohibition era, but of course, that would be ridiculous. This was a new neighborhood, his own house built not five years ago. 

Jack grabbed the shovel and quickly widened the hole until it was large enough for him to squeeze through. Crawling inside, he landed on packed dirt and shone his flashlight left and right. Picking left at random, he set off, his heart beating faster with the thrill of discovery.

The tunnel sloped downward, weaving left and right. The timber seemed fresher the deeper he went, and light bulbs hanged overhead, although they were turned off. Someone was clearly using this place.

He turned a corner and promptly bumped into that someone. Swearing, he staggered back and raised his flashlight. The two men stared at each other for several seconds before Jack recognized his neighbor.

"Ned? What the hell are you doing here?"

"I could ask you the same," Ned muttered, rubbing his nose. "Point that thing away, will ya?"

"Sorry," Jack said, lowering the flashlight. His heart was still hammering in his chest. "What is this place?"

Ned shifted uncomfortably. "Just... just my tunnel. I'm sorry, I know it's under your land. I started out small, but then just kept going and couldn't stop."

"Damn," Jack said slowly, looking around. "Your house is what, fifty yards away? Must've taken heck of a lot of time."

Ned perked up. "Just about five years. Come, I'll show you how far we've gotten." He turned and gestured him to follow.

Jack fell in step with him. "It wasn't just you?"

"Not anymore. Trevor from a street over joined in, and Mike—you know Mike—comes down here to hide from his wife. We call ourselves the dwarves." Ned laughed self-consciously. "Mike's idea, not mine, but it stuck."

Jack chuckled. "I suppose it fits."

Ned ducked under a low-hanging timber. There was light ahead, illuminating the end of the tunnel and a pile of fresh dirt. "Anyway, you gonna tell me how you got in here?"

"Oh, right," Jack said. "I was widening my cellar and broke through into this place."

"You too, huh?" Ned smiled. "Things just seem so simple down here. Peaceful."

Jack nodded slowly. "I think know what you mean."

Ned glanced at him, then jutted his chin at the dig. "Want to dig together? See how far we can get?"

Jack rolled his shoulders. "Hell yeah I do."
