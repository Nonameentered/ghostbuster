The doctor leafed through her printouts, tasting the air with her forked tongue. Adam and his parents sat in tense silence. Well, his parents were tenseâ€”Adam's own feelings were somewhere in the realm of curiosity.

"Well, the good newsss is that all of his blood tests are normal," said the doctor. "Almossst perfectly so."

"Oh, thank god," father said, patting Adam's shoulder with a bear-like hand.

His mother clasped her talons together. "But then why hasn't he had his Change?"

Adam resisted the urge to roll his eyes. Listening to her, one might think he was *dying*.

"That's the question, isn't it?" The doctor picked up a pen and a notepad. "I would like to asssk you some questions, Adam. If you're uncomfortable, I can ask your parents to leave."

He shrugged. "They can stay."

The doctor tapped her pen against the notepad. "Would you say you're happy? Content?"

"Sure. I have a good life."

"Hmm." She scribbled something down and smiled at his puzzled expression. "Don't worry, there are no right or wrong answers."

"I wasn't," he assured.

"Very good. And how do you feel about not getting your Change?"

"I'd be interested to know what makes me different," he said slowly. "But it's not the end of the world."

Mother sniffled. "He's so brave."

Adam *did* roll his eyes now.

The doctor winked. "How are you doing at school?"

He tilted his hand side to side. "Eh."

"Any foods you strongly dislike?" 

He blinked. "Well... I'm not a fan of bell peppers."

"But you always eat them when I make fajita," mother exclaimed.

"I don't hate them *that* much."

The doctor scribbled some more. "Favorite sports?"

"Don't care about them enough to have one, to be honest." Adam glanced up at his father. "Sorry, dad. I do enjoy watching football with you."

"It's all right," father said, chuckling. "I could tell you weren't really into it."

"Favorite color?" the doctor asked.

"Uh... I like blue. And grey. Brown's not too bad either..."

"He's not picky," mother said in a theatrical whisper. 

"I'm beginning to see a pattern," the doctor said excitedly. "Tell me, how do you feel about the leading presidential candidate?"

"She's kind of a jerk."

The doctor's brow furrowed. "That's a little unexpected." She tapped her pen against her lips. "What about her competitor?"

"He blathers a lot without saying anything."

The doctor leaned forward excitedly. "So if you had to vote today..."

"Er..." Adam scratched his head. "You know, I'd have to think about it."

"Please, doctor," mother interjected, "what do these questions have to do with anything?"

"Just tell us what's wrong with our son," father seconded.

"Oh, nothing is wrong with him as such," the doctor said, smiling. "Adam is just neutral."
