Dinner at home was the usual affair, which was to say Alex's parents were exchanging furtive glances as they decided who would start questioning him today. He resisted the urge to roll his eyes as he spooned the delicious stew into his mouth. They were worried about him, but really, he was fine.

"How was school today, son?" It seemed father would be the one to start.

"Fine," Alex said.

"Give me more than that, buddy." Father leaned forward eagerly. "Unless you want to keep whatever happened a secret?"

Alex did roll his eyes this time. "There's not much to tell. Got a C on a math test. Did some cool chemistry experiments."

"Oh dear," mother said. "I hope you weren't exposed to any mysterious substances unknown to modern science."

Alex sent her a flat look; she sounded like she hoped for the exact opposite. "Of course not. Our teacher never shuts up about lab safety, and we don't have anything *mysterious* in there anyway."

Her face fell. "Oh. Well, are there any subjects you've done particularly well in lately?"

"I did get an A+ in physics." He suppressed a snort at the excitement on their faces. "But so did half the class. It was a really easy test." The drop in their expressions was so funny that he had to duck over his bowl to hide his grin.

"Enough about the lessons." Mother seemed to have recovered first. "Made any new friends?"

"Or rivals who you hate but can't help aspiring to?" father added hopefully.

"Rivals, huh?" He chewed for a while and swallowed, stoking up the suspense. "Nope."

Father sighed and slouched back in his chair. "I see."

Alex returned to his stew. From the corner of his eye, he saw mother reach out and pat father's hand comfortingly. They were such drama queens. 

"Well... well, what about girls?" father asked. "Anyone catch your eye lately?"

"Kinda," Alex said.

There was a second of stunned silence before father slapped his palm on the table. "I knew it! I knew it would happen sooner or later!"

"Who is she?" mother cried, quivering on her chair.

"Amanda from my history class." Alex pointed his spoon at her. "Don't make such a fuss; we only talked a few times."

"Amanda, Amanda," mother muttered. "Doesn't ring a bell, but that could mean something in itself."

"Is there anything unusual about her?" father asked with a gleam in his eye. "A strange vibe, like she's not of this worldâ€”or maybe she vanishes at random times, or likes to climb to the roof to watch the sunset..."

Alex laughed. "What are you even talking about, dad? She's a normal girl." 

"Are you sure?" mother asked. "She could be leading a double life."

"Positive." He had *checked*. Getting involved with a protagonist would be just courting trouble. "She's really nice, and she likes painting."

"Er... I'm happy for you, son," father said, not very convincingly.

"Thanks," Alex said, setting down his spoon. "The stew was delicious, mom."  

"You're welcome, dear," she said, putting on a strained smile.

Alex brought his bowl to the sink and left the kitchen, pretending not to hear father's weary sigh and mother's soothing, low voice. He ducked into the bathroom and eyed his reflection in the mirror critically. *Ugh*, his black hair was showing speckles of red; he would need to dye it again soon. It had changed color right at the time he had discovered his powers. 

He washed his hands and left the bathroom with a whistle. Those powers would remain unused forever, if he could help it. His parents had told him all about battling monsters and saving the world, and that just sounded like a giant pain. As far as he was concerned, a background character's life was the best.
