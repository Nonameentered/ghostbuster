I've tried so hard.  My parents know I have a superpower, but because of the Anonymity Laws, the tester is forbidden to tell them what it is.  How can I tell them that the only thing it's suitable for is being a villain?  I can't even go to the police and ask them if they have any old cases that could be solved if they knew what had been typed on a computer held in evidence.  The Common Law Act says the police cannot use natural superpowers until over half the population has superpowers.

And I *will not* work for any of the spy agencies.  I've talked with friends who went that route.  Oh, no details, just "what's it like?"  Unless they're gushing about protecting the country against terrible threats (while staring at me with their eyes flicking side to side like metronomes), they look at me and, in a dead voice, say, "don't."

Nope. I am not going there.

So what's left?  Get an education, and get a regular job.  But here's my overachiever go-go-go parents, *insisting* that I use my powers and getting pissed off when I refuse.  So pissed off that when I hit 18 and graduated from High School, I came back from the graduation ceremony to find two duffle bags with all my stuff crammed into them, sitting out on the sidewalk, and a locksmith changing all the locks.

I just stood there, on the sidewalk, staring at my former home, tears rolling down my cheeks.  When the locksmith finished, he walked down to where I was, handed me his business card, and...

"Sorry, kid.  Your parents are assholes.  You need anything; you talk to me.  I don't know if I can help, but I guarantee I'll listen."

He clapped his hand on my shoulder and went to his next job.

I picked up the duffle bags, wincing as things went crunch and crackle.  Of course, they rammed all my models into the bags without wrapping them.

I almost went to the police and reported their illegal acts on a computer, but that would have been petty revenge and made me no better than them.

I shrugged them over my shoulders and staggered to my last friend's house.  I hoped for at least one night sleeping inside and a chance to use their phone to call around about jobs.

"Sorry, Joe.  Your parents called mine and made all sorts of claims that you'd done something terrible.  My parents told me not to talk with you.  I told them your parents were lying.  They punished me for lying.  In two months, I turn 18.  If I want a chance at college, I can't get thrown out."

I knew my parents had "friends" (say acquaintances who are scared stiff of being turned on), but I hadn't known Bill's parents were among them.

"I didn't know your parents knew mine.  Sorry to trouble you."  I could see he wanted to bring me in anyway, "No, Bill.  You get your education.  *Then* we can talk."  I sounded like I had a plan, so Bill nodded fiercely, shook my hand, and we parted ways.

*If* his parents go through with it, it will be four or five years before we can talk again.  I looked at that business card.  It was going to be a long walk.

I got there an hour after closing.  I looked around back and found one of those electronic locks.  Now, I *could* have opened it quickly, but that would have been wrong.  So. I found a shadowed corner to settle back into and waited for morning.

••• 

That kid is still on my mind.  I don't believe a god damned thing his parents accused him of; I know too much about them and their "friends" to believe anything they say.

I get to my shop, park in the back like usual, and walk up to the door.  I nearly jumped out of my skin when a voice spoke almost at my feet.  "Good morning, Sir."  I look around, and there's that kid, his two duffles, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes.

"How'd you get here?"

"Walked, Sir."  Standing up and stretching.  "I thought maybe you could use some help."

"Me?"

"Yes, Sir.  Several cars went through here last night, and all stopped at your place.  They punched numbers into that lock pad, cursed when it didn't open, and left."

Dumbfounded.  I was dumbfounded.  My security cameras never picked up anything, yet I knew someone was poking around.  Here this kid was, telling me they *were* here last night, as if it was nothing to him if they found him or not.  He must have seen something on my face.

"They never even looked at me."

I shook myself; let's get inside; we can talk about this where people can't snoop.  "Come on in."  I go to punch in, but he stops me.

"Here is where I might be able to help you."  He puts his finger on the five key and stares.  His fingers blur across the pad, and the door unlocks!  "After you, Sir."

I step inside and look at him, "Well, get your bags and come in.  I think we have plenty to talk about."

••• 

We did.  That poor kid got shafted by life.  A superpower he couldn't legally use, parents who were assholes, and all his friends were either gone or their parents were in his parents' pockets.  Who was also ethical enough to wait outside my place when he could have gone in, brave enough to quietly wait while late-night raiders tried to get into my shop, and honest enough to tell me everything.  Including his power and writing down the numbers my visitors tried.

They had the length, eight, and the digits, but not the order.  "With all this, why didn't they just stand there and ring the changes?"

"They can't, Sir.  The police sweep that alley with a searchlight every time they pass."

"Okay, Kid.  You got a job.  I can't pay more than minimum wage, and there are no fringe benefits, but I'll throw a cot in the back and teach you everything I know about locks.  Deal?"

"Deal!"

That kid has a good grip!

I worked for Mr.Willson for the next year, scraping up the money for a cheap laptop.  Just something to let me get at the state university's online classes.  It might not be Caltech or MIT, but they still had a solid accreditation.

Mr. Wilson stood by his bargain too.  He taught me everything he knew about locks, then got me licensed.  He paid for it out of his own pocket and presented it to me as a birthday gift.

I tried hard not to choke up.  I could see him embarrassed that such a simple thing moved me.  I stuck out my hand, and we shook.  It was the beginning of a new phase.  I became his unofficial partner.  We shared out jobs, but I spent most of my time at the shop, helping customers make good choices, fixing the odd job that walked in, and making spare keys.  I got a share of the profits I helped bring in, which helped my laptop fund grow.  Buying that laptop got closer every day.
