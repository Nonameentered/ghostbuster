Of the individuals given names, all but one were decent people.  That one got his just deserts.

For myself, I have had to deal with my name being abused throughout my life until college.  It's still a shock when I see an author use my name, but I remind myself that the author has no idea who I am, or what I'm like as a person.  They just needed a name, and pulled mine out of whatever random hat they use.
