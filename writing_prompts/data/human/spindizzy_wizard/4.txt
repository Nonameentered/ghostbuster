Continuing my thoughts, one could imagine a spell book with key words left out, like names.  When the occasion arises, you select an appropriate spell from the book, fill in the key words, and erase the portion you want to happen.  A combined blessing and curse with the name omitted.  Imagine a thief who steals the book and writes in the name of a hated enemy.  They erase the blessing, thinking the curse will happen.  Imagine the chagrin.  Or the reverse and a loved one falls to a terrible curseâ€”the horror at realizing what they have done.
