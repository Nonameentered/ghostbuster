Oh, I have no doubt that there was conflict.  It simply happened after the heroes came back.  And since the heroes were pissed at being kicked out, then begged to come back and be the executioners, they weren't going to listen to anything they considered bullshit from people who damned well should know better.

Kind of hard to have conflict when the target of your anger is a super, and you aren't.

Now, if you're referring to the conflict between the villains and the heroes, the usual reason that the heroes struggle is because they choose not to kill.  Since the last part was written by the heroes, they chose not to go into details.  It was a distasteful necessity, authorised by the legitimate government, and it's over with.  That's the end of it as far as the heroes are concerned.  How anyone else views it is their problem, not the heroes problem.

Aside from the PTSD and a distinct tendency not to listen to arguments from people who aren't happy with what their government authorized.

You're not happy, talk to your congress critters.  We can always leave again, if that's what you decide.  Of course, if we do, you can forget about us coming back again.
