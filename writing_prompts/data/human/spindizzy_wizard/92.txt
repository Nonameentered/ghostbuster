I was stupid.

"Nein!  Bad storm!  Stay!"

I had the weather forecast for clear weather for the next three days.  I rechecked the forecast, which was the same.  "No storm."  He shook his head.

"Nein!  Bad storm!"

"Papa!" A voice called out, and the old man's face screwed up in anguish.  "Bitte!  Stay!"  He said, but I had only two days left on this vacation.  If I did not go today, I would never climb this mountain.

"I will be careful.  I will turn back."

This seemed to mollify him.  A young woman came up with a chiding look.  She looked at me, "I hope my grandfather has not annoyed you."

"Not at all; I appreciate the warning of bad weather."

Her face relaxed, "Then you will be staying?"

Her face fell as she heard my excuses.  She looked at her grandfather and shook her head.  He looked at me, shook his head, and said, "Denken Sie an die Eisjungfrau.  Rufen Sie sie an und sie kann Sie retten."

She translated for me.  Her face was so serious.

"Remember the Ice Maiden. Call on her, and she may save you."

She and her grandfather turned and walked away.

I did keep more than one eye on the weather.  Checking the forecast repeatedly, watching the sky for clouds.  There was nothing.  No warning until I was halfway up the glacier.  A sudden shift in the wind and its speed picked up.  Looking on the horizon, I saw thick black clouds billowing up with frightening speed.

I did not hesitate.  Between the earlier warning and the unnatural speed of the clouds, I was unnerved.  I started my descent.  Before I had retraced a tenth of my progress on the glacier, I was enveloped in a blizzard the likes of which I had never seen.

Complete whiteout, with the sun so dim I could barely see the bright spot, I had to depend on my GPS tracker to guide me back. With the storm getting worse, I triggered the first stage alert.  It provides a position update via satellite to the climbing hostel every fifteen minutes.  They would know I was on my way back down.  I added the code for severe weather.  That done, I focused on getting off the glacier as quickly as I could.

Speed.  Speed was life.  On the glacier, there is no shelter.  The wind can come at you from any direction.  Breathing becomes painful; as your energy is sapped, your speed drops.  Soon I was at mountain speed.  Step, three breaths, step, three breaths, repeat, repeat, repeat.

My mind numbed, and my vision shrank to the next step.  Every fifteen minutes, the tracker beeps, and I check it to make sure I'm not turned around.  Still a quarter of the way to go.

I'm not sure what happened next.  I remember checking the tracker and then?  Nothing.  I have fallen, and the tracker is nowhere to be found.  The lanyard is still with me, but the device is missing.  I remember where the sun was, but how long have I been unconscious?

Get up.  Step, three breaths,...

*Ten feet off the path, the tracker beeps.* 

••• 

Deep within the ice, a being stirs.  Something strange has interrupted its slumber through the ages.  A plaintive chirp, as if some strange bird were laying on the ice, slowly freezing.

It would have gone back to sleep, but the chirp kept disturbing it.  Finally, the chirp stopped, fading out in mid-chirp.

Maybe it can get back to sleep now.

••• 

I'm going to die.

Step, three breaths.

Stupid weather service.

Step, three breaths.

Ought to have that old man on your staff.

Step, three breaths.

What was it he said?

Step, three breaths.

"Eisjungfrau!"

••• 

Deep under the ice, eyes snap open revealing pale blue irises.  What was that?

••• 

Step, three breaths.

"Eisjungfrau!"

••• 

An elegantly slender neck bends as a head turns in the direction of the sound, pale blond hair falling back away from a heart-shaped face.

••• 

Step, three breaths.

"Eisjungfrau!"
