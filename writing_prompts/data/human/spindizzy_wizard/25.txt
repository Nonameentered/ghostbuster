### Post-Race Conference: Senate Penal Racing Committee 

The committee members believe this session is closed.

"Superintendent, what were you thinking?"

"At what point, Senator?"

"When you decided to let that maniac join the race."

The Superintendent — is not stupid — he is wired to the teeth and broadcasting live, using the same sort of tech they use for the track.

"I remind the Senator that I do not have control over the selection of drivers; this body does.  I further remind the Senator that he has informed me, personally, that I do not have the power to remove a driver who does not violate the written rules."

"As a result of your poor judgment..."

"No.  Senator.  I am not playing that game.  The responsibility resides with the power, and that is squarely in the hands of you and your colleagues."

One by one, the other Senators twitch, and glance at each other.  There is some information being passed.  One wonders what it could be.

"Stop interrupting me!"

"Then stop lying.  I bear no responsibility where I have no power.  This body holds power, as *you* have made plain for the last five years, Senator."

"I've half a mind..."

"Well!  At least you recognize your limitations!"

"YOU ARE FIRED!"

"No, Senator.  You do not have that power."

"What?"

"My position comes from the President.  This body sets the rules and the limits of my power.  You can change the rules.  You can even strip me of all power, leaving me a figurehead.  You cannot replace me.  You cannot fire me.  You cannot even ban me from speaking openly of this meeting despite it being a closed session.  Those powers are given by the president, and you cannot take them away."

"We can find you in contempt of Congress."

"I have no problem with that, since there are members of Congress that I find eminently contemptible.  In any case, that is not why we are here today.

"The proper question for this august body is where do we go from here?  A whole field of rookies with one expert driver?  Do we cease the races?  Do you find the other half of your mind and leave the entire matter in my hands?  Have you asked your constituents what *they* want?"

"If you think we are going to give you a free hand to pander to the morons who watch the races..."

Senator Diego interrupts.  "Objection!  My constituents are not morons, and they have definite ideas on what they want to see."  There is a rumble of agreement from the other committee members. "I move that this body turns all aspects of Penal Race operations, other than budget, over to the Superintendent."

The call "Second!" is a chorus.

The demand for an open voice vote is clear.  The result is foregone.  The threat unnecessary, but the chairman was never smart enough to leave it unsaid.

"Very well, Superintendent.  It's entirely your responsibility now, and I'll be watching you like a hawk.  What do you intend to do?"

"Gentlemen, the first order of business is to straighten out the finances.  I propose a simple plan.  Of the gross revenues generated by the Penal Racing program.  15% goes to the racers for equipment, all of which must be from these approved lists.  15% goes to the general operating fund of the program, which is in need not only of more staffing, but replacement and upgrades for the broadcast system.  30% to go directly to the general repair funds of the prisons.  The remaining 40% to go to rehabilitation programs.  Designed not to ivory tower ideals, but to down to earth practical programs that have *proven* themselves.  The list of approved programs and the training are listed here.

"Gentlemen.  The power of the purse is indeed in your hands.  Please have the kindness to use it wisely.  This program has been repeatedly raided for things it was never meant to fund, and worse, for initiatives that have made rehabilitation a poor joke among both the populace and the prisoners.  I beseech you.  **Leave the prison money alone if you have the slightest desire to meet your constituents fondest wishes.  Less crime!**"

The chairman is unimpressed but is quickly overridden by the other Senators.  Not because they necessarily agree but because their staffers warned them *this meeting is televised.* 

One can only wonder how bad a Senator must be before his staff does not warn him of the same fact.
