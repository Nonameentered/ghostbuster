I'm trying to remember the title... Healer?  He got hit with a parasite that kills 999/1000 and survived.  It mostly resided internally to his body, and made adjustments to make sure he stayed alive.  He had incredible healing powers, I think mixed with periods when he became the Typhoid Mary of the galaxy.  He tried to stay isolated then, and it usually worked.
