### Mission Control: Extrasolar Exploration Agency

Radio: "Infinity, this is Mission Control.  Do you read?"

Director Benson explains to the honored guest, "They're due back about this time, so we've been calling every hour just to make sure they know we're still here, and nothing too weird has happened."

"You're joking!"  The Prime Minister of Tonga is shocked at the suggestion.

"Not at all.  There was a very low probability that the drive would put them into an alternative universe.  Or worse, from our perspective, the time contraction would result in them arriving back a thousand years later or earlier!  I'll grant you, the probabilities were practically zero, but they did exist in a mathematical sense."

Much calmer now, the Prime Minister continues.  "I see.  And how do we know that none of those mathematically zero options have happened?"

"Cherenvok radiation.  We've seen the receding cone of radiation that their FTL passage creates.  They're here, but their sublight drive will take time to bring them into our range of their transmitters."

Radio: "Infinity, this is Mission Control.  Do you read?"

Radio: "Mission Control, this is Infinity.  We read you."

"Director Benson?  He sounds... sad.  Very sad."

"Yes, he does.  Please, Prime Minister, do not speak of this until we make an official notice."

"Agreed.  Director?  If there is anything that Tonga can do for your project or whatever issue Infinity has discovered, please bring it to my personal attention."

Surprised, Directory Benson responds, "Certainly, and I thank you.  Support for interstellar exploration has dropped off.  We had hoped for exciting news from Infinity, but now... Honestly, to me, he sounds like a man facing execution."

### ESS Infinity And Beyond

"I have no idea how they're going to take this, but I can't expect it to be good for the program."

"I understand, Sir.  Still, we have proof that there is life beyond our own."

"Yes, we do.  Life that is in such desperate need that none of them have a pot to piss in when it comes to anything but survival.  There's no chance for trade, and we are so far ahead of all of them in the sciences that there's no chance for the exchange of knowledge.  The best we can hope for is resources, but they have no materials that we do not have."

"True.  But it's even worse.  They have not surveyed their systems; we would have to expend a great deal of time and effort to gather the information necessary to determine what resources they have.  It will be far less expensive and difficult for us to explore our own system or find uninhabited systems to exploit."

"It'll be the end of the extrasolar program.  I'm terribly sorry, Captain.  I know how much this program means to you.  To all of us.  There must be *something* we can do!"

"Well, Doctor, if you have an idea, I would be delighted to hear about it."

### Tongan Prime Minister's Office

Mr. Prime Minister,

You were kind enough to offer your aid.  I do not know what you could possibly do to relieve this situation, but if you have any ideas, I would greatly appreciate hearing them.  This brief will be released within the next 48 hours.  I cannot delay it longer than that and may have to release it sooner.

In Great Hope, But Little Expectation,

Director G. Benson

...

With the greatest of sadness, we inform you that although the rumors of life in the universe other than our own are true, life is in such dire straights that there is no possibility of meaningful discourse or commerce of any sort.  Instead of going forth and finding grand civilizations and new challenges, we find disruption, disease, poverty, death, and all the ills that we have struggled against for so long.

It is ironic.  We finally solve all those issues for ourselves and go forth to find the same issues awaiting us among the stars.

...

"Prime Minister, what is it that holds your attention in Our presence?"

"Forgive me, Your Majesty.  You know that the Infinity And Beyond has returned, yes?"

"Yes, although I see little use to us in that grand venture."

"Perhaps not, and yet, there may be something we can do for them that would, in the end, repay our kindness a thousand times over, Your Majesty."

"Continue, Prime Minister."
