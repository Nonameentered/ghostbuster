"How do you know that?"

"I spoke with the lady you called rather than *assuming* that it was Father Patrick.  She sent him to bed before you called."

"Should you speak with her again, please convey my apologies.  That is hardly adequate, considering my language, but it is what I have to offer now."

"I spoke with her at some length.  You have been selective in what you have told others."

"Yes, I have."

"Can you tell me why?"

"Mother Superior, what are the consequences if Father Patrick is found to have had direct communication from God?"

"Why, he would... Oh, Dear."

"Yes.  The consequences for Patrick would be bad enough.  What of the remainder of the clergy?  This is just one reason the Church never beatifies anyone still living."

"I see."

"Please, if you have the opportunity, try to get Father Patrick to understand.  I am afraid he will no longer listen to me, and I cannot blame him for that.  I must go to confession; then, I believe I will meditate on this matter.  Perhaps God will grace me with an idea since I have none left myself."

"I will pray for you."

"Thank you.  And thank you, whomever you are who has a man telling a very amusing story.  I envy you such a friend.  I will pray for all of us."

The phone clicks.  "I had no idea his hearing was so acute!"

"Perhaps the phone has a volume setting?"

"That must be it.  His old phone fell victim to a power surge, although it looked to me that the handset was crushed."

"A power surge indeed," I commented dryly.  She chuckled, "So!  Not a lie!"

The Mother Superior continued, "I will keep your confidences.  Until and unless it becomes necessary to testify in an ecclesiastical court."

"Acceptable."
