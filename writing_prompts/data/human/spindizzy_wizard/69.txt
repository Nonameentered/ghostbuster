Another one... At least this mansion appears like a genteel refugee from the post-war south.  It's a relief from the usual foreboding manse that looms over your head, threatening with every step forward that it may crash down around your ears.

This one simply says: I am here.  I will always be here.  My master will always be here.  If you come in peace, you may go in peace.  If you come in violence, you will never leave.

That last is a whisper, borne out on the thousands of minnie ball marks on the face of the mansion.  They came.  They attacked.  The estate and owner are still here.  Oh, the marks are gone now—expertly repaired long ago.

I know they are there because I have seen the photograph and read the after-action report from that battle.  I am here to settle accounts with the owner of this estate.  This debt has gone unpaid for far too long.

*KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK* 

I wait patiently.  His one servant is elderly and slow to move.  Still, three knocks are sufficient—any more will only aggravate him, adding unnecessary stress.  The door opens smoothly and without undue sounds.

"Yes?"  His servant is tall, almost a parody, but the solemn look and quick eyes speak of a wit held in check.

"Doctor Raymond Van Helsing, to see Lord Graymoore.  A matter of financial import."

He looks at me, somewhat perplexed.  "The Master is nearly awake, and night is close; do you not wish to return at dawn?  Perhaps with trusted friends?"

"A misapprehension, my briefcase holds pens and a largish quantity of paper.  I intend no violence."

"Please, come in. I will see if the Master is ready for a visitor."  I am guided to a richly appointed study.  "Please wait here."

I possess myself with patience.  Through the windows, I watch as the sun finishes setting.  Across the lawn, with the Magnolia trees on either side, the view is enchanting.  I watch until full nightfall is upon us.

A voice speaks directly behind me.

"I would not expect one of your lineage to come on a mission of peace."

The voice is cultured but not unusually accented.  This one has worked hard to fit in.  "Perhaps peace is not the right word, yet I am not here to offer physical violence but to settle a debt you have long ignored."

"A debt?"

I turn to face him.  He appears as any gentleman might, well dressed, well groomed, not at all archaic.

"Doctor Raymond Van Helsing, of the Internal Revenue Service.  Whether you are the original Lord Graymoore or a descendant, you and your hypothetical ancestors have never paid any taxes.

"It is my sad duty to inform you that either we come to an amicable agreement on a schedule of payments until you have caught up, or the United States Government will have to freeze all of your accounts."

He smiles thinly.  "Violence indeed, but not physical. Come, let us reason."  An elegant gesture towards his desk.  He directs me to the chair at his side, a signal that he wishes a non-adversarial resolution.

We work through the night, and as the cock crows, we have reached a preliminary agreement.  The fiction that he is a descendant will remain undisturbed.  When you come down to cases, vampires at this level mainly desire peace.  Blood hunger is not an issue; blood banks, unfortunately, must dispose of far too much blood that is nearing the end of its useful span.   At this level, the vampire often owns several banks outright.  More than enough to keep them well fed even on the freshest blood.  The last thing you want is to drive a stable community member into a frenzy of self-defense.  They do far too much work ensuring that their less well-endowed compatriots do not cause undue harm.

"A pleasure working with you, Lord Graymoore."

"And with you, Doctor Van Helsing."  His servant appears in the shadows remaining before dawn.  His eyes are red. "Ah, may I assume the individuals approaching the house in stealth are not yours?"

My face turns stone hard.  "They are mine by blood.  But that is all.  They appear to need another object lesson.  Shall I deal with it?"  It is his land and his right to defend himself when he has committed no crime other than tax evasion — now settled — and self-defense.

"No, there are those who have become restless since the War of Northern Aggression."

His servant nods and departs.

"If you will forgive me, I must make my retreat.  The sun and I are constant adversaries."

I nod, and he departs.  In the early dawn hours, the screaming begins.  By 10 am, the last scream was two hours ago.  I gather my papers and my things.  As I approach the front door, his servant stands in my way, holding my coat.  While he helps me don the coat, I comment.  "There is one left."  I turn to him, and he nods.  "A sniper."  He nods again.  "You have been unable to find that one."  He hangs his head.  "Not your fault.  Dhampir are rare indeed."  His eyes lock to mine; the red is a brilliant glow.  "Yes, the same one who dealt with your prior master."  He bares his teeth.  It would be a terrifying sight, but his eyes are now looking over my shoulder.  "Hello, Jason."

"Hello, Raymond.  Time to pay for your crimes."

"Funny thing, Jason, I was about to say the same to you."

The servant glances back and forth between us.

"Yes, we are twins."  His eyes grow large.  "Blood is thin.  Jason fought for the north.  I fought for the south.  We both knew what would happen if the balance was disturbed.  Jason did not care; I did."

At that moment, we leaped—servant and I at Jason, my brother.  Werewolf and Dhampir, versus Dhampir.  Neither of us is vulnerable to Jason's bullets. It devolves to hand-to-hand.  The grand foyer is devastated, but in the end, Jason falls to our combined attack.

"Kinslayer!" is Jason's last word to me.

Yes, I have killed my brother.  But my brother has led our entire family to their dooms.  All save Sigmund, who places his hand on my shoulder in sympathy, and myself, who sought only peace after that war.  Jason would never give up The Hunt.

I look at Sigmund, "Do as you think fit.  I must report in," Sigmund nods.  He doesn't say much, not after he watched Jason kill our mother.

I used to wonder if I was the evil twin.  Not after seeing the glee on Jason's face as he murdered our mother.  I leave, and the door shuts behind me.

*Alpha, Delta 4, Ray leaving the house.* 

*Delta 4, Alpha, clean shot?*

*Alpha, don't give an order you know will not be obeyed.*

*Delta, take that shot.* 

*Step out in the sunlight and give that order, you disgusting bastard.* 

*Take the shot, or your family dies.* 

*Break.  Sigmund? Did you hear that?  How about the rest of you?  You want to live under someone like that?*

The sounds of fighting erupt behind me—a pity.  I hope my brother survives, but I cannot interfere.  The IRS has no jurisdiction over domestic disputes.
