### Pack Bonding 101 

In many species, the advantage of having reliable partners in life's little moments of stress is obvious.  What is less apparent is cross-species bonding.

The Frang/Guon bonding is one of the most well-known since it approximates symbiosis, yet the two species have full ability to exist without the other.  It's simply that their abilities are so perfectly matched to cover for the other's lack that they were considered the same individual for many years.  Eventually, the tripartite language barrier was broken, and the individuals involved on the Federation side got an earful for ignoring half the partnership.

Now, I know you all want to hear about humans, but we will not cover human pack bonding in this class.  ***HOWEVER***, this class is a *prerequisite* for any subsequent classes, *including* humans.  So you can sit right back down.  You want humans?  You must learn about *us* first.  That way, you will have a basis for comparison.  Human Pack Bonding is covered in 201.

### Pack Bonding 201 

By now, you should all have reviewed the class progression and be aware that we may not reach humans in this class.  The administration, in their infinite wisdom, has plans to expand the curriculum, which would push Human Pack Bonding to a 400-level course.

Nevertheless, we will endeavor to include at least some aspects of human pack bonding in this class.  I have already informed the Administration that they do not have the sole say in the curriculum and that this class *will* cover the more common human/other bonds.

— Professors F'Targ/G'Kald; opening remarks on Pack Bonding 201.  This is the first class dealing with humans, and the class sizes are once again reasonable.

### Human Pack Bonding 301 

You are congratulated for making it this far.  In this class, we will cover lesser-known pack bonding among humans, as well as the health benefits that even bonding with a small prey species can bring.

For that reason, after this session, this class will also require Biological Sciences 202.  Offsetting that requirement, this class counts as double points to graduation.  However, since I disagree with the Administration on the necessity of these curriculum changes, no additional work will be assigned.
