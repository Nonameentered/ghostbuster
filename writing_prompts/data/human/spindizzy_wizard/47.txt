### Cat And Mouse 

Over the next five biological years of the Time Traveller, many interventions are attempted.  A clandestine organization grows around the laudable goal of improving the human condition.

Finally, that organization accepts that a single individual, moving through time linearly, is responsible for every setback they have experienced.

### THIS Ill-Timed Rebellion

"We must plan simultaneous operations," says the head of the organization â€” The Historical Improvement Society.

The Time Traveller disagrees.  "Simultaneous operations are not possible; you already know that."

They have had this argument before.  The reasons are clear enough.

You would need to send two teams back with the same device since you cannot operate two different devices within plus or minus a year of the same slice of Planck time.

To retrieve the teams, the device must remain active and in the original arrival location until all are recovered to that location.  It is impossible to reestablish a relationship for recovery at a later time; the very presence of the team creates a disruption that precludes recovery.

Wherever a time device is in operation, no other time device can ever reach that time again.  Not even from the other side of the universe.

And the one hard rule that the Time Traveler has insisted upon.  "No up-timer may remain in the past for any reason.  Even dead, they must be brought back or turned into elemental vapor."

There are good reasons for this rule, but they are not based on a physical law that makes remaining impossible.  Instead, they are based on three goals.

(1) Avoid anything that threatens an ongoing chance of exposure.

(2) Even a body could carry information, or disease, from the future to the past for an agile mind to read or a vulnerable population to contract.

(3) Limit contact to avoid cross-temporal contamination.

Of course, that assumes they are not on a suicide mission.

"It is entirely possible if we have no intention of recovering the teams."

The Traveler grasps the meaning.

"But that would mean that the team must suicide!"

"Indeed.  And for some missions, finding someone willing to die to see it done even at the cost of suicide is trivial."

"No.  I will not allow that on two grounds.  First, the recovery of a team is essential to learn what happens.  Second, the vaporization devices are a terrible risk, only intended as a last-ditch... You have no intention of listening to me, do you?"

The lazy smile of the Director is a sufficient answer.

"In that case, I have no reason not to use this," holding up a solar detonator, the same device used to vaporize irretrievably lost agents.  "I had one surgically implanted.  This is the external dead man switch."

As the directors start to stand, "Oh, don't bother leaving.  You each have one as well.  They are all tied to mine.  If I die, you all turn into miniature fusion bombs.  If you leave my presence beyond a certain distance or for longer than allowed, the same.  If you attempt to have it removed, the same.  If you leave this facility, the same."

They all slowly sit back down.

"I always knew the risk of involving others, so I took steps."

The Director responds dryly, "We seem to be at an impasse."

The Time Traveler smiles at the Director, "Not as much of an impasse as you may think.  I can choose to leave, and none of you can stop me without dying.  I can choose to stay, and again, none of you can stop me.  Neither of those options is high on my list of desirable plans since both would require the destruction of THIS and all personnel.  To be blunt, everyone associated with THIS knows too much about time travel to allow you to run free.  At least not until we achieve our goal."

The relief in the room is palpable.

"I propose a meeting between ourselves and this unusual individual.  Obviously, they have a reason to stop our attempts to improve humanity.  I would like to know what it is.  Perhaps we can make use of that information in a way that will achieve our goal without upsetting whatever the other has planned."

The directors are all skeptical.

"I propose we send one mission back.  I will be the single agent."  A not at all concealed shift among the directors.  "As long as the time machine remains operable, we will all survive.  If any of you decide that THIS is no longer acceptable, switch the machine off.  We all die."
