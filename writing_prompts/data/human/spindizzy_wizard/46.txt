“SHOW YOURSELF!!!”

•••

Everyone told me I had to have faith.

Everyone told me that I simply had to believe.

Everyone said he works in mysterious ways.

I said, "Bullshit.  Everything you've said amounts to God being on the same level as Santa Claus.  No, on a *lower* level than Santa Claus because parents will go to ridiculous lengths to make sure their child believes in Santa.  Making the miracles happen.  Showing their children that Santa is real.  Those parents will not lift a finger to help their child believe in God."

"You are not a child!" they rebuked me.

"Compared to what God is purported to be, I am his child, and he has done *nothing* to convince me that he is real."

"That's why it's called Faith," they remarked snidely.

"And what of William?"  They froze.  "Did William believe?"  Oh, yes, he did.  "Did he do everything in his power to save his family?"  That and more.  "And what happened then?"  The church kicked him out when he had a screaming breakdown in the middle of services two weeks after losing his entire family.  "Did you sanctimonious bastards try to help him?" No, they didn't.  "Did you ever think that God expects you to put the same effort into helping people believe in God that you put into Santa?"  Sacrilege was their answer.  "Sacrilege.  Christian charity to the same level as you would for a commercialized Saint is sacrilege?  I'll tell you what I think of that!"

And I did without ever once using profanity, taking the Lord's name in vain, or raising my voice.

I got out of that church alive, with two black eyes swollen shut, a broken arm, a fat lip, a concussion, and bruises in places I didn't know I had.

There wasn't a mark on any of them, so why did I do 30 days in jail for assault?  No one had an answer for that either.  At least when I had the chance to speak with the judge, he had the grace to look embarrassed and away.

My apartment was re-let, and my property sold to pay that last month's rent.  My car was impounded and sold for parts.

I went right back into that courthouse and filed multiple civil lawsuits against every stinking one of the bastards involved in this travesty and argued my cases so eloquently that I was awarded damages on top of court and legal fees, as well as the actual value of everything they took from me save one: the value of my faith, if not in God, then in the good nature of my fellow man.

I bought a motorcycle and minimal necessities and left.

They undoubtedly thought the same thing I was, "and good riddance!"  I still think I got the better of that deal since I am free, and they are still stuck in that cesspit.

I toured a lot.  Saw a lot more that made me sad.  And finally found this place: a high rolling hill in the middle of a plain so broad that you can almost see the horizon.  There isn't a sign of human habitation that you can see from here.  I checked around quietly and found out who owned it.  A quiet word with the owner, and I had permission to camp there indefinitely as long as I kept my camp clean.  The owner even had a booklet on how to keep a clean camp according to his wishes.  The purpose of my camping there was some soul searching and asking God for some answers.

Every Sunday, we would meet on that hill before dawn and watch the sunrise.  It's magical.  We would spend the entire day talking about anything as though it was the essential thing in the world.  I told him what had happened to William and me.  He shook his head in sorrow.  We talked about what I did and how it made me feel, which was empty.  Oh, there were those moments of triumph, but once the money was paid, all I wanted was to get away from there.

We talked about the future.  What did I want to do?  It kept circling back to that town.  The people I knew there was decent folk.  The silent ones suffering.  The brash youth being led astray.  The tough guys who weren't as tough as they thought led to mistakes.

I would go back.  I would open a "place of worship," nondenominational, welcoming, helpful, and never judgemental.  I did not care who you believed in, who you followed, or what you did so long as no one, not even yourself, was harmed.  Come with an open ear, a warm heart, and a helping hand, and you will be welcome.

There was just one last thing I wanted.

I wanted some proof.

Thus, that heartfelt scream on the morning of my last day on the hill.

After a moment, a calm voice echoes from the heavens in reply with a simple question: “Why?”

"Because faith is not enough."

We had every argument I had ever had over the nature of God and the validity of demanding faith as a sign of worthiness.

"Fine.  If you are unwilling to support those who believe in you by making your presence and approval plain to all, then I will not profess your faith to anyone."

"Why?"

"Because I refuse to put myself in a position to be told I am no different than the charlatans who loudly profess your faith but refuse to provide proof.  Nor will I support a God who lacks the courage to stand up and be recognized."

I'm trembling like a leaf on the inside, but I'm resolute, which carries the day.

"I will visibly support you, but I warn you that the result is your death at the hands of those who put you on this path.  No, I cannot change that for you if I would not change it for my son."

In the end, he was right.  I was murdered by an assassin paid for by the council of faiths.  The discovery of that was the death of every other church in the town save the one I started.

Never accept a faith that has at its core the demand that you do not ask for proof that it is legitimate.  Yet do not turn away if the proof isn't flashy either.
