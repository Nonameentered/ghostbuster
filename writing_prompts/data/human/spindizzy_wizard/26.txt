# WARNING: GRAPHIC VIOLENCE AND GRUESOME DEATH

In the race, a relatively short 100 laps at the venerable Indianapolis Raceway, deaths happen almost immediately.  One driver tries to side-swipe Assassin into the wall.  He ends up in the wall instead, and the car explodes into flame, which spreads across the track.  The driver struggles but does not exit the vehicle.  No emergency services are provided.  There is no yellow caution.

"One down, Mike."

"Yes, Don.  Did you notice...?"

"I did.  That fuel tank exploded for no reason."

Another driver, less aggressively, attempts to put Assassin into the infield.  Assassin evades easily; the other driver runs into some debris from the earlier crash.  His car flips into the air, headed for the viewing stands.  Still spinning, the gas tank explodes, spreading its deadly payload across the crowd.

"The locals did not expect this!"

"Nope.  The prisons are going to breathe a lot easier this evening.  Did we get any clue who was sitting in those areas?"

"The complete chapters of the Aryan Brotherhood for this prison district.  They paid to have EMS standing by for them and their brother, the driver who sprayed gas all over them."

"Why didn't they show?"

"An *Anonymous Donor* bribed the Department Of Corrections to keep EMS services out."

Jointly, "Who would do that?"

The rest of the drivers are cautious.  They stick to racing.  Assassin is easily the best, moving up through the laps to second position.  A Pitt maneuver in the wrong place spins the lead driver side-on into an unguarded concrete retaining wall.  The car splits open, and the driver is thrown on the track.  He lies there stunned while the remaining drivers mostly manage to evade him.  Mostly.

"That was..."

"...sickening.  Excuse me."

Sounds of retching come from the studio.  In quick succession, the remaining drivers are dispatched.  The last driver stops his car in the pits and refuses to come out on the track.  Assassin pulls up next to him, and there is a conversation.  Finally, Assassin pulls away.  Holding his hand out the window, he clenches his fist around something.  The last car explodes in the pits, and Assassin flamboyantly tosses the device away.

"I guess that's it."

"There aren't any other drivers unless..."

> "Cut to the garages!"

A low rumble is heard; one car is slowly revving the engine, testing itself.  It is The Strangler's car leaving the garages, coming out on the track.

"Mike?"

"Yes, Don.  I see it too."

"He did say there would be only one survivor."

"And I heard a package was delivered."

"This is it, folks.  There is still some racing; we will return in a moment."

> Cut to the car, moving slowly onto the track, in a picture in picture as silent ads run with the engine sounds coming through clearly.

"Strangler cannot think he's going to win, can he, Mike?"

"Stranger things, Don.  Stranger things."

As Strangler's car moves around the track, he stops at each wreck and uses his vehicle to push the debris out of the way.  When he comes to exposed remains, he climbs out and carefully moves them to the infield.  In some cases, he has to make multiple trips.

All the while, Assassin's car shadows him.  Always staying a discrete distance away, never encroaching.  Respectfully.

Soon, Strangler pulls up to the start-finish line.  Assassin joins him there, and they both climb out to converse.  It is a short conversation. They shake hands and return to their cars.

"I wonder..."

With a scream of engines, they take off racing in earnest.  Despite Assassin's best efforts, he cannot keep up with Strangler.  Soon, Strangler is on the same lap.  Now the driver's race begins with maneuver and feint rather than overpowering engines.

"Don?  Why isn't Strangler pushing past?"

"The crew just finished the fuel calculation, Strangler and Assassin have nearly the same amount of fuel now, and the pits are unusable."

"Will it be enough?"

"I believe so, but you cannot be certain.  There's no data from the cars themselves."

On the last lap, they are side by side, Assassin on the outside, going into the final corner.  Both hit a slick spot and start sliding toward the wall.  A jagged piece of the first car juts out into the track, and Assassin's car is impaled.  The metal enters the driver-side windshield low and juts out low from the driver's door.

Both cars run out of fuel and die, stacked against the earlier wreckage.

Movement is seen in both cars.  Strangler is out first and runs to Assassin.  He reaches into the car and drags Assassin clear.  One of Assassin's legs is gone, and the bleeding is bad.  Strangler applies a tourniquet, which slows the blood loss.

They're arguing over something; the commentators remain silent; this is something they have not seen before.

Strangler hefts Assassin up on his remaining leg, and they hobble to the finish line.  Together, they cross it.

Strangler lowers Assassin to the ground. And kneels next to him.  Assassin's body goes lax; he has died.

Convulsively, Strangler rips his helmet off and screams, "IS THIS ENOUGH BLOOD FOR YOU?  HAVE YOU HAD YOUR FILL?"

> "CUT!  CUT!"  The screen goes blank for minutes before a jarring jingle for laundry soap cuts in.

"The only soap that washes your clothes as clean as your soul!"

The irony is not lost.
