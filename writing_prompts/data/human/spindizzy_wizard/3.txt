### Catalog #32 

**Lux Orb** 

Appearance: a small sphere of perfect quartz crystal.

Function: (1) Tossed gently upward, the orb will ignite brilliant white light, hovering at the best position to provide the light desired by the user. (2) Hurled at an opponent, the orb will flash blind all who look at it when it is within three cubits of the foe.

Notes: In the latter use, if the foe manages to avoid blindness, the orb will circle them until either recalled by a thought or successfully blinding the target.  We have not attempted its use against groups of opponents, but we fear this is not long from happening.  Word of our fortune has spread far faster and broader than we would ever have wished.

### Catalog #924 

**Miniature Ark of the Covenant** 

Appearance: As described, but of a size to fit within the palm of the average person's hand.

Function: We decline to experiment.  

Note: Taking inspiration from an author, we have placed this item on a pedestal adjacent to the only door into the storeroom.  A sufficiently aware individual there to seek things of power may be incautious enough to open it.  What happens then is, at this time, anyone's guess.

### Catalog #82 

**Ornate Silver Trumpet** 

Description: As a common trumpet, but made of silver, ornately engraved, inlaid, and begemmed in nature scenes in all the glory and majesty that nature can inspire.

Function: The music you play affects the natural world for good or ill.  The trumpet reflects the last usage in the illustrations.

Notes: There is a classical piece of music that never fails to inspire the listener to conceive a beautiful dawn before a glorious day.  I played that song to the benefit of a friend being married that day when the forecast was for foul weather.

The marriage and reception, both outdoors, went off without a hitch.  I spent the subsequent week traveling in a constant soaking downpour to avoid flooding any one place.  Thank the gods of your choice that trains are seldom disturbed by weather.

Finding myself drawn to the thought of what would happen if you played "Night on Bald Mountain," I have asked my husband to hide the trumpet from me.

### Private Diary 

My wife requested that I hide the trumpet from her, and I agree that it is for the best.  I have cured my own curiosity in doing so by opening the Ark — with my eyes firmly closed — and placing the trumpet inside of it.

The interior is filled with items.

I shall not share this information with my wife.  I only write it here against the failure of memory, or my untimely death.

These diaries are the most secure form of storage I can imagine.  Only I can open it on my entries, just as my wife can only open it on hers.  We know others have used it, because there is a list of authors that can be called up.  I cannot see my wife's name, and she cannot see mine.  Yet there are names we have verified the existence of who are deceased.  The most terrifying is the first entry, which is a blur.  We believe the first user is still alive—the second user dates to the early Egyptian period.
