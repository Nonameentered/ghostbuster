"You don't want to do this."

"Barkeep?  You keep to the bar and leave adventuring to us."

I mutter, "If I do that, I lose more customers."  Louder, "Leave word if there's anyone you want telling if you don't return.  I'll see it reaches them."

"And how much will *that* service cost us."

"Not even a clipped copper.  I don't dun the dead."  That I'm willing to do it for free sobers them, but only for a moment.  One young boy I recognize from the next vill over nods at me and holds up one hand, fingers spread.  Five days.  I nod.  The others see this and rag on him.  "THAT'S ENOUGH!"  I roar.  "He's willing to do the decent thing and not leave people guessing!"  They look at me like I've grown a second head.  I stare them down.

In the morning, they come around and leave word of who to contact.  I see them on their way, but I like not how they glare at the young boy.  He does not seem to notice, but as they leave, I see him deliberately hold back until everyone else has goneâ€”especially the older man who spent much of his time honing his daggers.  Perhaps he does know but feels bound by an oath.

At nightfall, that young boy steps into the torchlight of the door covered head to toe in blood, his eyes vacant.  I tell Martha to take the bar and go out to him.

"Lad?"

There is no reaction.  I've seen this before.  He's in shock from what he's seen.  Gently, I lead him around to the back, where I do my butchering.  I keep a large tub there, fed from a trough run from a creek not too far away.

Martha, bless her, has sent Gerant, our blacksmith, to help.  Between us, we get him stood under that tub.  With a swift yank on a lever, the tub dumps its contents over the lad.  It's cold, and the shock frees his mind.

"What!?  Where am I?"

As I suspected, he has no memory of the events.  An honest lad, if memory serves me, his mind has blotted out a memory too horrible for him to face.  Leave it be, I say.  Leave it be.

In the morning, I write several letters and send him home with those letters.  Like most, he cannot read, so I've made marks to tell him which letter goes to who.

In the years after, many parties came to loot the tower or make it their own.  None returned, and none survived save that boy.  I never saw him again for over ten years.

### A Dark And Snowy Night 

I have to make it to Leads Vill!  I'm already late as it is, and now I've lost the trail.  Only the storm is worsening... I'll feel a right fool if I'm found frozen dead come spring.  It's what my vill headman told me would happen, but after ten years in the city, I had a message to deliver and a deadline to do it by.

A fat lot of good it'll do if it doesn't get delivered til spring.  Late it may be, but I must seek shelter.  I keep moving up the valley, so I'm headed in the right direction, even if I'm not on the path.

There!

Is that a tower?

Ha!  I've passed Leads Vill by half a day!  Well, I still need shelter, and that is all there is.  I hope the occupants will let me stay the night, even if it's only in the stable.

> A guardian observes the approaching young man and makes a decision that it has waited for, ever since the former owner of the tower died.  *THIS ONE.*

> The other servants prepare.
