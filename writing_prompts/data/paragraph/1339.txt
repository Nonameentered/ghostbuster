I didn't realize the peculiarity of my arm until I started school. At age five, I was sent off to the elementary school to learn the joys of reading and math. All I encountered, however, was the cruel reality of my classmates' rejection. When I told them about the organ in my arm during recess, they only further isolated me, either laughing or running away. I only managed to make a few friends, preferring the lonliness of my bed. Being alone made it easier to deal with the constant jeers of my peers.
