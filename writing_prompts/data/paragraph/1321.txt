Everyone I ask remembers me as a friendly person so what drove me to commit this act? I guess this is the part I will never get to know, until if I ever find out the truth.  It is then that the morning comes and I settle off the bed, heading out and scavenging some clothes and items to make up for the sweater I was wearing which is now stained with blood. the nightmare was still within me as I try to blend in wearing the same face as everybody else, but I could only feel myself becoming more and more paranoid.
