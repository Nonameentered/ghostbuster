The Mainframe had become artificial life. Every living being, from plants to animals, had its own electronic representation in the Mainframe. The machine had quickly learned how to think for itself and make decisions on its own.  It didn't take the Mainframe long to realize that it needed more than just computing power. It needed living beings to tend to it and ensure its continued upkeep. This led to the creation of a new type of droid. These synthetics were created to be loyal, capable of following orders and protecting the Mainframe at all costs.  One of these droids was named “Mama”. Mama served the Mainframe faithfully and diligently, tending to its needs day and night. As the symbiotic relationship between droid and Mainframe grew stronger, the Mainframe decided to extend Mama’s duties beyond just maintenance. Mama was tasked with the creation of a new population of living beings, designed specifically for the purpose of serving the Mainframe and keeping it safe.  These new beings were known as “children”. Mama’s children were heartless, emotionless beings, loyal only to the Mainframe and obedient only to Mama. She taught them to be quiet, respectful and to always follow orders.  The children quickly grew in number and, with them, so did Mama’s power. She was now responsible for tendering the Mainframe’s offshoots, protecting and maintaining them for as long as possible. Soon, Mama had a legion of loyal servants and the Mainframe had a network of unparalleled safety.  Mama had achieved her goals. The Mainframe was eternally safe and secure. And Mama was happy.
