For this, we must utilise the resources of Jol'el, that is why we will be destroying your planet.' 'No, NO! THISSS CANNOT BE!!! '   Dave roared, a vein popping on his forehead. Beyond his rage, however, he was only met with silence. The goverment had crumbled and the unionists had been powerless against the sudden invasion of the reptilians.

A yellow light, similar to the one the creatures in the sky radiated, was slowly becoming brighter with each passing second.
