I had a problem then. If I couldn ’ t take anyone I knew, who could go with me? There was no way I was letting this power go to waste, so who should I take along? After family I tried starting the freeze out with someone then ditching them. That didn ’ t work, as soon as they were out of sight time resumed as normal.
