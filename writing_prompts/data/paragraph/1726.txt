As the game goes on, Mario is throwing the most perfect, succulent meatballs down the gravel pavement that he can muster. He further surprised everyone by winning the match. Then, during a victory dance, something happens that nobody could prepare for. The meat cubes, in their ball form, melt in the heat. All of them, hitting the pavement like a herd of wildebeest, completely exposing their raw, uncooked insides to the public.
