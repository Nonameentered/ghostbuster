High school would have been a lot easier if I could have snacked. Instead, I have to make sure I finish my three bottles exactly two hours apart and always at the same time. It gets boring too. I switch up what they actually look like, just to keep myself from going insane. Chocolate-flavored milk for breakfast, lime-CytoFluX for lunch and banana-flavored electrolyte-y gunk for dinner. You get used to it after a while. But still.
