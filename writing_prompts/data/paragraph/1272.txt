'Well I'm not really, I don't have super human strength or the gift of otherworldly magic. I'm clever but not nearly as sharp as a magically enhanced mind. I'm fairly squishy, I cut easily, I'm regularly seriously injured by plants and rocks that are just lying about. I have a ludicrously high pain threshold but I'm really very easy to kill.'
