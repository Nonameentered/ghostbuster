It had been a fairly successful system of collecting what little bit could from the atmosphere, and he had been quite pleased after collecting several liters of what had seemed like clean liquid to survive the week.  There hadn't been much else, not for a very long time. He was among the last dozen kilometers of people left on the planet, unable to sustain a living in what had been otherwise the most plentiful and blessed land of his home. He knew there would be no respite, no end to the hardship that had settled on all of them. Â No way of truly getting out of this god-forsaken place.
