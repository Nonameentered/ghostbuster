'Long ago, when I was married, I swore never to have kids. I didn't want any children to be born into this world, so that was that. But my wife had other plans, and so my daughter was born. I fell in love with her and swore to devote my life to her. As she grew, though, I began to worry.'How would I protect her from the world?' So I set out to every doctor, physician, and scientist I could find, asking for a cure. Of course, if there was a cure already, no one would be like this.'
