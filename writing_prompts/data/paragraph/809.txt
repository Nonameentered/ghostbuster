One day those humans learned of Elves. But it wasn't for the meeting of races nor from Dwarves. They stumbled into the deepest, oldest caves. Drawings were painted with blood on the ancient walls of the underground hall. Paintings of tall pointy eared creatures reading and killing their Dwarven friends. It was the Elves and they were the enemy.
