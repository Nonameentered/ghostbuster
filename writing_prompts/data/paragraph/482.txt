It wasn't too hard to create a new universe where there were creatures on each planet, in each solar system, in each galaxy, living and dying constantly... And he folded this universe into itself countless times until it was a vessel fit only for him. He scanned the minds for what they all considered perfect and used them to make a single form- old with a flowing beard of pure light to show endless age and wisdom, a stern gaze that perceives all and demanded respect, a powerful and perfect body of infinite and endless strength, 10 beautiful wings of pure white dove feathers that showed not only speed that he could fly through the universe but also endless compassion. He was draped in pure, golden robes signifyingneternal wealth but also sandals of pure red, smooth leather, signifying the endless journey that he could walk with a single step.
