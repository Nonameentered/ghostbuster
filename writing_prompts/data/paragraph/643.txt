'You know, some people would think living forever might be a gift. I have made many friends, but I've lost just as many.' I pause for a moment. 'I've been in love, I've experienced all there is to life, and even the some more. Loneliness is just another part of life, as is love, heartbreak and death.' I take another sip of my coffee, 'And even still, if I could make the choice to make myself not live forever, I probably would n't. The human race interests me, seeing where we all began, and where we're about to end up I couldn't be more excited to experience the next 2000 years.'
