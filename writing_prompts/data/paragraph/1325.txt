I finally arrived at a room being escorted by the captor, who was revealed to be my partner from the crime. He was a man older than me, scrawny looking, yet his face seemed to hold experience I could see. He gave me a fond welcome asking if I was alright. I gave him a blank, confused expression, as I try to process the current situation. He told me that he was the one who planned the hit, and had gotten me involved with it. He gave me an explanation, and a reminder that even though I cannot remember, I still am part of this crime.  He then told me a good tip, he told me to find identities of my victims, so that I can find out of their family and the crime more deeply. That way it'd be easier for us to keep proceeding for our plans and with that I finally understood why him and I didn't part ways. He accept me as part of this now, as he explained that we were partners, growing with each other, and through this knowledge, I felt safer here.  It was here when I embraced my name as Frank Baker, my alias for this lifestyle, and found a life I could accept. Vowing to never again commit a crime, I desired to never forget this situation ever again, but rather understand how insecurities and bad decisions can bring the worst of crimes. No matter how many lives I touched, I know I must not do this again, and understand the truth of what its like to be a criminal.
