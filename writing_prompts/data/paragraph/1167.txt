And so Claire went on, much older than her years, and far stronger of a person than anyone could ever imagine. Then one day, a woman in her early 40s went into the hospital complaining of sudden chest pains, but exited it in a body bag. Claire was called to the hospital when the body came in. She figured, just like always, she'd perform her miracle on the woman, spray her with embalming fluid, and pass her body onto the family, all the while feeling a little bit of satisfaction in her work. But when she saw the woman lying there, cold and dead, Claire felt something new.  She felt a responsibility for the woman.
