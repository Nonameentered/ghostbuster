The United Nations have worked together in the time we had to devise a plan for those of us left to brave it out.' I cleared my throat, and looked down at the list in front of me. 'We have began building, in suitable areas, large underground shelters able to fit ten thousand people, along with enough rations to feed them for up to a year. In addition, each shelter will be fitted with its own garden that can provide for our nutritional requirements should the need arise.' Thank god for the hydroponics boom. 'A list of shelters can and will be made available to you by your regional governments in the passing weeks. All shelters will close two weeks before the scheduled arrival of the asteroid.'
