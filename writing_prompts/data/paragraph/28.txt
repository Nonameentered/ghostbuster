'W-w-what is it?' Janice stammers. 'It's like... like it's alive!' Malkowitz quickly regains his composure. 'I'm not sure yet, but I'm going to find out.' He turns to the others in the room. 'We need to be ready. This could mean serious trouble. And not just for us.' With that, he heads quickly towards the bridge, the rest of the crew right behind him.  We soon arrive at the bridge. The atmosphere is tense. We all take our places, plugging in to run diagnostics on the moon's surface. We wait with baited breath for the results. They come in quickly. 'The surface is being filled with excess energy,' Johnny reports. 'Whatever's causing it, it's doing so incredibly quickly.' Malkowitz nods. 'Increase shields for the ship and reverse the gravity fields surrounding us,' he orders, 'We don't want to get sucked in to whatever this is.' We all rush to do as he orders. The ship begins to shudder as it diverts energy to its shields. We all grip onto our workstations, prepared for whatever comes next.
