The freshly done burgers had perfect grill lines across both sides. He had only flipped them a single time, it's the rule. They had been topped with a thick slice of cheddar cheese, three slice of bacon and a single leaf of lettuce. You had to get veggies in your system, somehow. He had baked the sourdough buns himself, they had been timed to come out of the oven just moments before the food was off the grill. It would be a satisfying meal, the juices of the hot meal running down the sides of his hands. The satisfying crunch of the bacon mingling with the slightly burnt texture of the scores from the steel grating of the grill.
