I ’ ve had five months to reflect on my actions, to really think if that one punch was worth my death. The answer was easy to figure out – no. I ’ m not that stupid. But in my half a year, I ’ ve found freedom. I can have a drink after work if I like, I can fuck my wife, I can say fuck! I can throw on an old R rated movie and watch Arnold Schwarzenegger blow some shit sky high. I ’ m not saying I ’ ve been around the world on a pleasure cruise, living like a playboy for my final year. But I have lived, for the first time in seven years, I ’ ve lived.
