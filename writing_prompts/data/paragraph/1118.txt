Perhaps I might go back to Vienna and dine off the simple people whose beer consumption is admirable as much as it is shameful. Perhaps I will get back to hearing the operas of Strauss and Mozart, or maybe the occasional performance of Marschner ’ s 'Der Vampyr.' But for now, I sit like Tosca, in a place I should never wish to be waiting for the right moment to make my escape and be free again. Now, this never sleeping city of Milan holds me hostage with the taste of death on everyone ’ s lips.
