The children obediently run inside, one of them calling her "Aunty Arya." The camera follows ARYA into the castle, which we now recognize as the seat of House Tarth. As she enters, JAMIE and BRIENNE stand up and join her. JAMIE: Looks like you made an impression, milady. ARYA: It's been a long time since I taught the Younger Starklings. I'm a bit rusty. JAMIE: I'd say you did great. The camera cuts away to a wide shot of the three, who are now facing each other.  ARYA: I should get back to Winterfell. I still have unfinished business there. Brienne stands a step in front of Jamie and places her hand on the older lady's shoulder, warmth radiating from her face. BRIENNE: You have a home here now. We'll keep your place warm for whenever you are ready to come back.
