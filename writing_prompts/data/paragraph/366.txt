Surprisingly, no one spoke or even moved. I looked around the auditorium, and only saw two kids at the back. They were a boy and a girl, and seemed to be talking about something. The boy had a wooden cane he was leaning on, and the girl had auburn hair and had her hands on her hips in an 'I-don't-give-a-damn' pose. It was strange, but I knew they were important in some way.
