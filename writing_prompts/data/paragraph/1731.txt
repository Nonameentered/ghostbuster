The first step was to collect evidence. I pieced together the shredded communication log and discovered that the last message received by Jones was a request to meet with someone in the hydroponics lab. That was when I got curious. I checked the security footage and noticed that this person immediately left the scene after Jones went in, but the person was not wearing a space suit.  That was enough for me to know that this person was the murderer. I follow the trail, looking at the other cameras and tracking the individual's movements. I discovered that they had entered the station a few hours before the murder occurred, and that they had left the station shortly after Jones had died. I also found a white flower on the floor of the lab that didn't belong and, after putting two and two together, I realized that this person had left it as a calling card.  At this point, I was convinced that I had my murderer. I presented my findings to the mission commander who ordered an emergency arrest. I set up a trap and, in the end, the suspect was apprehended. I had solved the case and we had our murderer.
