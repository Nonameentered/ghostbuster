My most pressing task as far as my continued survival is concerned is to solve overpopulation. To do this will take an absolute masterstroke of a plan; that's well within my capabilities. I have several tricks in place that I have employed already, but this next one will be one for the history books. Ironic really, because I took it straight out OF the history books! It's just about marketing the right ideas to the right people. Did I mention how good I am at marketing?
