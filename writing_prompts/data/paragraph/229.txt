We open on a very wide view of a majestic Gold Hall. Two sets of tall, golden stairs slowly descend from the left of the frame, with two separate towering thrones set atop them both. The camera slowly zooms out until the faces of the two thrones can be seen, and a man and a woman are seen seated in them, faces expressionless.  The man is JON SNOW, hands folded in his lap. The woman is DAENARYS Stormborn, her black locks and iconic silver boots partially visible. The silence is broken by the thump-thump of slowly approaching footsteps.
