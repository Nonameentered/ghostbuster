I set down the paper and looked back to the camera. 'There are many other changes in government policy I need to inform you of. One of the most pertinent of which is the world-wide implementation of a strict resource allocation. Officials will decide who gets what according to age, job skills, and so on. This is the only option we have left.' I was proud that no one had seemed to protested much. The option of a resource war seemed unacceptable given the time frame, and people had largely resigned to their president's fate. My heart thumped in my chest. This next part was something I had wished for many hours I would not have to say.
