With fear crippling me, I decided to try to sneak my way out only to find out I was being followed by the local law enforcement. In a panic I switched my outfit with a random person and ditched my coat with blood. The thought of being caught made me go on a spree for the next few days, believing they are trailing me while hiding and living on the streets with no home or purpose. Was I making any sense while trying to escape?  No.
