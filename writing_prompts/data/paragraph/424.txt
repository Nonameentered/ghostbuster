'Ah. That took many years and so many mistakes. Sometimes I thought I'd never fix these dreams, just be stuck away in a corner of my own mind forever.' He looked up and smiled. 'But I realized something, something that was so simple yet so hard for any dreamer to comprehend. To truly manifest my dreams, to make them as grand and alive as I wished them to be I had to feed in them experience. I had to live and learn a little of the world it was to be set in. That's when I started traveling, used what I learned to dye my dreams with vivid blues and greys. Run through those hills and go fishing in those rivers. I had to become a part of the dreams in order for the dreams to become real. Only then I had achieved the beginning of true imagination.'
