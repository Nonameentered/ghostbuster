For a daemon NEDD had a particularly nice voice, it was deep and strong and reverberated so that you felt the lower consonants rather than hearing them. 'What brings you to this place mortal?' NEDD was technically mortal too but he could pull off the look and did so as his standard greeting to challengers.
