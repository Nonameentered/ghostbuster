The young man closed his eyes in resignation and accepted the chalice. Then with a single guzzle, he drank the entire potion and felt a burning sensation inside him that slowly started to spread throughout his body. His vision blurred and he felt himself slipping away from the world of reality and into a dream state.  At first he felt nothing, nothing more than the tugging sensation of slipping between worlds. However, soon he started to feel a vast energy within him, like a thousand stars had been set alight within his chest. He could sense the sheer power he had acquired and knew exactly what it was. He was now a god.
