Eddie, the bane of the astronomy elective, was about to open his mouth to query the bizarre statement, but fell silent as Dr Mehmed continued speaking, his lips not even moving. 'Calculations point to the successful re-entry of an intergalactic probe, one presently orbiting around Tangerines Major. According to the navigation parameters, the intersection with the Upper Atmosphere Surveillance Net is slated to occur in a mere minute. Shall we give it a go?'.  The class stayed silent, too astonished at what was happening to even breathe. Dr Mehmed had just predicted the re-entry of a probe that was currently in orbit around another planet? Impossible! Eddie couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at the sheer mental capability of the professor, and hoped deep in his heart that the prediction was accurate.  Dr Mehmed tapped a few keys on the computer in front of him, a map of Tangerines Major in full and vivid colour appearing on the projector screen. A yellow dot appeared on the map, zooming in closer and closer until an intricate series of symbols could be seen tracing the route of a single dot.
