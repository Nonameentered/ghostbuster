It was a rare sunny day in my hometown. I could see children running around screaming joyfully while the adults set up a barbeque party. I was about to light up a cigarette when I heard a collective gasp from a whole block away.  Of course, any addiction and small pleasures were forgotten as most of the citizens ran out of their homes and business offices to see what the commotion was about.  We all looked up… and there in the sky, between the bright and fading stars…. was a massive crack on the surface of the moon. It was massive - a half moon in itself. The edges were searing as if the mountains of the moon had been alight. There were whispers of some kind of blast, something blew up the surface of the moon and planted this giant canyon.
