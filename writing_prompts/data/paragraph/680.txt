My door is open. But my parents ’ house is unfamiliar. I have bookcases on the wall, along with trinkets that once filled my childhood. I don’t recognise the wallpaper, or the old photos that line my walls. I have no idea what year it is. I can’t help but panic, I try to process what is going on before I reach into my pocket for my phone.
