The Magus sprung into action and pulled forth another vial, this time a blue one. He threw the vial into the middle of the German's group and, as soon as the vial touched the ground, a wall of bright, blue flames erupted. For a moment, shells of armor, bullets, and screams of terror filled the air. Then the flames began to eat away at the bodies and steps of the German's, pushing and then calving them away from the King's army and into the waiting arms of the enemy Magus.  The German, now surrounded with destruction, ushered his own Magus forward. William had never seen armor like it in the British Army. It's color was darker than the night sky, distinguishable from the regular brown Army coats. The Magus himself wore a hooded cape with a red interior. William knew it only meant one thing, he was an enemy Magus.
