I had worked hard. I had been born to a poor family of immigrants, who came to this country in search of a better life. We lived in a tiny apartment, barely enough room to move in. Worked in a factory, and barely made it by paycheck-to-paycheck. But I had worked hard- despite all the odds, despite all the obstacles, I had made it. I was no longer just a street urchin, but a Candidate, a potential leader of mankind.
