Hundreds of families across one hundred generations aboard one mammoth ship. A thousand years ago it was launched with the singularly simple goal of depositing a collection of humans on another planet to build a colony. Planet by planet, system by system the *H.S. Renewal* has visited a laundry list of exoplanets but each has been crossed off like items on a shopping list. One simple task had turned into the longest mission in mankind's fifty thousand year history. In fact the current generation of explorers could be called human in genetic makeup only. None had any first-hand knowledge of Earth or the Sol system as contact with Earth had been lost some two hundred years ago. It is unknown who fired the first shot but we do know it was the United States who committed to full-scale nuclear retaliation. Now the *Renewal* contains the only known surviving Homo sapiens. Survival the primary goal, education the primary means of attaining that goal. Survive, educate, populate; that is the motto of a faction of the refugees aboard that still believe their voyage ever had a mission. Another faction believe it as the last voyage of the damned, set off a thousand years ago by fools.
