As he drove out of town, he passed through a lot of places where he grew up. He passed the old arcade where he once spent $ 5 in quarters just placing with his friends from sun up to sun down, caring only about beating each other â€™ s high-scores. He drove by his old elementary where he once starred as 'the wolf' in his class play of The Little Red Riding Hood when he was 8. He drove by the carpentry shop where he and friend got their first job.
