...*Thud* He jerked back into consciousness, alone. And jolted back to set his fist where it was before he lost consciousness. He readied himself for a second, thinking about all the meat that used to be in his fridge and all the cold drinks he once drank. He thrust his fist into the ground, 'Food. Water. Please.' Suddenly he felt the mound shifting and he heard a *splish*, as if some secret deep underground could no longer remain so. He pumped again, and the sound repeated reluctantly, emerging from the same spot with greater force. He pulled his arm back and felt the mound move, like wet porridge. He leaned forward and smelt, and was greeted by a rich, wet earth. Unlike the baked dirt he was so used to, this was full, ripe and healthy. He reached his hands forward and pinched some mud between his fingers, pressing it into two discs between his palms. He seemed to realize something in that instance and, with a new surge of vigor, he moved forward and sunk his whole fist deep into the earth. He savored the feeling, the coolness, and when he pulled back his arm he watched fresh water spring out, dampening the dirt and the furrows of his hands.
