'This was a very complex situation, requiring a great deal of skill to pilot the Voyager safely and precisely. It serves as a reminder of the potential power of knowledge and technology.

A sharp voice cried 'FREEZE!' and the room fell silent, as a dozen more figures came swarming in, each pointing a deadly weapon at the astonished doctor and his students.
