Toby's eyes adjusted to the new reality and the comet filled his vision, lit up by God's own spotlight. Its deep ruddy hue struck him with awe and wonderment, so alien and yet so familiar. He could feel his ship creaking, groaning in the uncomfortable proximity to a celestial body. But Toby had faith in its design. After all, it had brought him here to make history. He pushed his ship further, closing on the comet's dark side. The stars reappeared on the horizon and the temperature dropped, though his instruments registered denser air than expected. This could mean catastrophic failure for his craft, but Toby remained focused and pushed onward. He felt the ship shivering between himself and the comet, and he embraced the sensation wholly, allowing the fear to wash away as he maneuvered closer.
