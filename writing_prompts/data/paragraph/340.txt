At the King's Fountain Akron took a seat and waited. After a few minutes he saw Pitch walking up the street, a grin on his face and an ever-bobbing cane in his hands. He stopped and spotted Akron, waving his cane in a big arch overhead. Akron knew what this meant and stood from his chair, waiting. Pitch walked by his rows of tables and chairs, smiling and nodding to the proprietor who smiled back. Finally, he reached Akron and clapped his hands together. 'You figured it was me, Sarge,' he called in a voice that was more a bark then a speech.
