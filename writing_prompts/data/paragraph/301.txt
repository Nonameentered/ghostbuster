I can't say it's a total shock that I ended up here. I was always a little different, even as a kid. Every other kid was interested in Quidditch and I decided I wanted to study Defense Against The Dark Arts. Of course, I always got top marks, but I don't think they'd ever take that seriously. That's why I wound up here.
