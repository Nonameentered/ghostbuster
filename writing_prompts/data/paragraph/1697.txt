Uneasy, Gary clicked cautiously into the inbox to read the latest email. The sender was names 'God Almighty'. Gary's eyebrows rose. He hadn't heard from Him in several centuries.  He opened to the mail, feeling a heavy weight settle on his heart as he read.  'Gary, My inbox is full. I haven't been able to read any of the prayers coming from Earth for the past week. Someone has sent a virus to your computer system and it's completely blocked out any of the emails sent in. I'm currently unable to take action, and I'm afraid the virus will be here for the foreseeable future.  I'm sorry.  God Almighty.'  Gary slumped back in his chair, his stomach flip-flopping. It was hardly a surprise- those up in Heaven always had bigger priorities, and their main concern was to ensure that individuals and their communities were finding their own solutions to problems as opposed to relying upon divine intervention. It was a noble mission, Gary had to admit, but the feelings of helplessness and worry that it brought weren't ones he enjoyed.  Gary looked up at the door of his office, and before he'd even formed a thought in his head he was on his feet and striding across the room. Reaching the corridor, he skidded to a stop and rounded on the angel guards at the end.
