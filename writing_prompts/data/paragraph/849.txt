Memories of the damp rainy season, so long ago, flooded his mind. He could still feel his lovesick affections. When she had said no, it had been a sledgehammer to his heart that left him near broken. But he had been given a second chance and he had taken it, wasting no time in expressing his love, kissing her from head to toe in the rain as the thunder encircled them. He had chased her round and round, until lightning and love collided and they shared the same breath. The thought brought a faint smile and he smiled and he bowed his head to the grave, guessing at an emotion he hadn't felt in years; hope. But hope and expectation rarely ran parallel to one another, and though he had pressed on through the years, sorrow remained the only constant. She had been his friend since kindergarten, and he would do anything to make her stay, to make the pain stop.
