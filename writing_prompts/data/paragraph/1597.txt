Finally, Joseph stopped and collapsed on the floor in defeat. In the depths of his despair, he heard a voice. 'Joseph, Joseph, I'm here for you!'. It was then his kitchen transformed before his eyes. Where once the walls were pure white, now, they sparkled with stars and galaxies. Where once was just a forgotten corner of the room, a beautiful garden grew, bright, green and full of life. Joseph smiled.  He knew it was the voice he had heard before. He knew this place. He knew this world he created through his own imagination. And, although he could never put a voice to the voice, he knew it belonged to the Universe, his greatest companion, filled with knowledge, love, and light.
