We had to think fast. **** 9:47AM I glanced around for someone who could help us, a flight attendant or something. That's when I saw the pilot and an idea came to mind. Knowing that the plane was struggling with a broken engine must have taken its toll on him. I asked her to distract him while near the cockpit while I snuck up behind him. As he was distracted I quickly noticed that something was off. Something was out of place. I removed a panel and saw exactly what it was. We had a bomb. 9:49AM I quickly alerted her and we both knew what had to be done. We had no time to alert the authorities or the passengers, we had to act fast. The quickes way? We had to disarm it ourselves.
