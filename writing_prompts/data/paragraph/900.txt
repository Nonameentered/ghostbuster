People ran, or turned to ash, some just stayed behind and chose fate.   No city was spared, there was no region or place to hide. We die in the ashes.   And yet, from the ashes and in a time that the world thought was forgotten, a party arises.  A team of individuals whose mission was simple: fight fire. Wherever, whenever, for however long it takes. They were determined to slow it down, to protect what isleft and to eventually hopefully put out the fires that ravage the world.  This is their story, a testament to all humanity that in even the darkest of times, even from the depths of the fires, knowledge, courage and hope can arise.  This is the story of those who chose not to accept that everything burns, and that the fires can be stopped.
