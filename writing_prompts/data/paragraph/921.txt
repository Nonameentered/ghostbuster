I opened my eyes and emptied the gun in the clone's direction, watching the body slump against the ropes secured against the chair. The client, my now numbed old buddy, was enough stunned he barely moved. His mouth gaped open in terror and amazement.  '...Why?' He asked.  I put my gun away and stared him in the eyes. '  Because you had me do the job.' I stated.  And without another exchange, I left. I drove out of there feeling heavier than I ever have. I knew what I did was wrong, but I had no choice. I had a job to do and I did it. That's all there is to it.  -- -- --
