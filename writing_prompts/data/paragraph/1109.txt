This is the story of how I got into drugs. How it started off as a way to cope with the stress of living, and quickly became an addiction. There was no turning back. I was in the hands of the 'Cocaine God'. I'm writing this now because I want to spread the word about the dangers of drugs and how quickly they can become an addiction. I'm trying to save others from going down the same dark path I did.
