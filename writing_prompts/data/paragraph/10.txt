This is the end, the mere end of me and my struggles, my life and every second of every day that I spent struggling to stay alive, struggling to make things right... I stood still as the figure approached me, I couldn't move, my mind was unfocused, my eyes were squinting, I could feel the freezing air creeping in, I could hear the eternal darkness whisper to me.  'You have been given a second chance, a second chance to make something different, something more pure and true.. Do not forget how fortunate you are to get another go at life'  The figure extends his hand, I held it tight and I suddenly felt my body dissapear, I could feel again.. I'm standing under the stars, one last time, I pray for a better world.. with all of my heart and soul.
