Having asked many people in my area, I've come to realise that people like me are rare, but exist. We can see the 'soul escorts'. Not to be confused with spirit guides, the benevolent creatures who apparently help you through your life, these creatures help you end it. In the past I've been able to prevent deaths because I've seen them, but I decided, with the help of a forum comprised of only Seers, that the risk of playing with mortality is too great. Some have provided evidence that ghosts or other supernatural apparitions are what you get when someone dies without their spirit guide, left to wander Earth for eternity, with no way out.
