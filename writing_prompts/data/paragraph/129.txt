I'm not allowed to think about it much longer, as the feeling in my stomach bubbles over and pops once more as it had been doing all night, slowly worsening. I pinch my eyes shut, knowing what's coming next, and for just one moment, as the pain peaks like a giant wave waiting to break, I think I may just die this time. And just as quickly, the wave reaches the shore, and I know I have a few moments of peace. I open my eyes and look around. I can't help but surrender to the weight of them after a few moments, and I drift to an uneasy sleep, as the tension escapes from my stomach and from the rest of my body, dissipating into the small space I call home.
