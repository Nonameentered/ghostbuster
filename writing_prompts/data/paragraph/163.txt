For a brief moment, I am tempted to go out there and finish it. They would never know it was me. Nobody would come looking for them. I could finish this and so many of these late night incidents would end. But I know better. It brings me no satisfaction. Plus, I'm still weak from the fourth strike. I struggle to my feet, ready to go back to the cabin.
