Bob's eyes lit up and- ignoring the gravity problems- leapt up and excitedly snatched the bottle. His pulsating red skin glowed as he brought it to his lips and guzzled the contents down.  'Oh yeah! This is the best!' He belched out a few more clicking noises in the bar's holographic atmosphere and slammed the bottle back onto the counter with a satisfied smirk. He wiped the edge of his mouth and pointed to Bill with a pudgy finger. 'I don't understand,' he said in a slightly lower than usual tone, 'how you humans can tolerate the gravity of this planet. You do ridiculous stuff with style.'
