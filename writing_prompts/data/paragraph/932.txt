My reverie over a can of Campbells is interrupted by a loud banging on my livingroom window. A crime to be caught enjoying your meal, apparently. A sign in the hand of one of the assailants reads “GOD HATES POWERFUL MAN JUICE.” My fingers tighten around the can of SpaghettiOs as I realize I have stumbled into a pro-life demonstration. It ’ s gone viral in the past few days, apparently. Protestors outside of every grocery store in town, demanding that the government outlaw prune juice. As one of the weird, second-wave ex-partiers, I am not exactly enamored with the idea of my government trying to tell me what I can and can ’ t eat – but this seems a bit too far, even for me.
