I start to make my way up, despite the pain in my side. I'm on the run now, he'll come looking for me if I don't leave soon. I hurry through the woods and onto the main street. Cars whoosh past and I can almost feel their drivers staring at me as I stumble along. I tuck my mask into my shirt and make my way to the old convenience store.  Once inside, I slip into the back room and close the door behind me. I attempt to sit down but the pain is too intense, so I just lean against the wall and try not to move. If I stay still long enough, I can pretend I am somewhere else. I drift off, imagining a small cabin out in the woods. It looks just like the one in my dream.
