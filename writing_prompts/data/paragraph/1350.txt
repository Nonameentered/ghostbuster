William heard a groan and saw a soldier on the bottom corner of the trench. He was about to step down to help when he saw the Mage kneel down next to the soldier and start to chant something inaudible. He threw his hands out and pushed a yellow aura directly over the soldier, healing wounds that William wasn't sure existed. The soldier got to his feet, thanked the Mage and then re-joined the platoon at the top of the trench. William tossed the dead soldier, he now remembered his name was Andrew, over the edge and then looked at the Magus.
