Bob started to laugh uncontrollably. 'Dang!' he sputtered, 'it sounds like you got a real bad deal! And a horrible experience being the 'Test Subject' of the Alliance! But you did get to be the president and have all the limelight to yourself! It was hard to miss that on the news!'  'Ha!' Bill said, 'yeah, it was great! I mean, they were gonna put me in a- ugh- museum and make me talk to the press! I don't really talk to anyone there anyway, so that was a plus.'  He slammed the shotglass and pushed the empty bag back to Bob. 'It really sucks that I had to go through all of that though. At least they made the accommodations really nice and made sure to pay me well. But still!' Bill said, his eyes wandering off to the neon sign behind Bob. 'I mean, why the heck did they have to pick me for this? I'm just some random traveler who wanted to explore the universe a bit.'
