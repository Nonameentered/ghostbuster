I know, it's a long example. When I explain it to friends... when I explained it to myself, even... I learned that I love making that fully realized burger. I like putting that piece of freshly done food in their mouth. You've got to rekindle that interest in cooking up a story. You need to figure out what flavors you actually like. If you start but never finish anything, you need to diagnose what that is. Are you not interested in the final product? Then you're cooking the wrong story. Are you vested in the final product, but the work to get to that end isn't satisfying? You need to start mixing in different ingredients, adding flourishes, seeing things that other people don't see or don't give much attention to.
