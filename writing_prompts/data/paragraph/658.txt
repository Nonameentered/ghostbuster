Gulp. I can't believe what I had just heard, my cat had somehow learned to talk. Now he's asking me to quit my job and go on some 'adventure' with him. What is this, Alice in Wonderland? No way am I going to leave my job for some random crazy cat adventure, what kind of ridiculousness was that? But I could've sworn he said something Smart.
