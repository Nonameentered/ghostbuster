“ Vladimir Ufa, ” the Care Bear repeats, his voice dripping with malice. He takes a few steps towards the young man, claiming his attention. “ Very well, Vladimir Ufa, I will have need of you and your skills soon. Remain here at the Palace. ” The Care Bear’s voice lowers and fills with a menacing fury. He points a black claw at the young man. “ And, Vladimir Ufa, if you ever speak of this to anyone, your life is forfeit! ” Vladimir gulps, nodding profusely. “ Yes, My Emperor! No one will ever hear this from me! ” The Care Bear grins, though there is no warmth in it. He turns around and crawls back into bed, pulling the covers over him and muttering something about Capitalist Pigs. Catherine grins, her blue eyes scanning the young man. She motions for him to leave and as he turns around, she whispers, “ Maybe we will have need of your skills in other areas as well, Vladimir Ufa. ”
