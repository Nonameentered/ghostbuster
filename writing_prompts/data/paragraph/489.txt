What? You think I'm asking for a pile of helpless newborns to knock off? That's a big NO from me. It's nothing but a silly rumor that's grown up around here, and it's a royal pain.  Let me put it this way: when I, Lucifer, took over this corner of hell, I inherited an enormous number of innocent little babes. I didnâ€™t ask for them; no one did. But it has been my job to provide for them, as much as one can while residing in the depths of the afterlife.
