Fires from a careless spark, ignited in careless haste, can tear a city down, start a war, kill millions in a blink of an eye. There are no safe harbors from a fire, it's a force of nature that claims all victims equally, it has no morals, no prejudices, no ideals. Fires have the capacity to wipe entire civilizations off the face of the Earth, and they do it with an almost effortless glee. A single home fire can take away a family, a forest fire can be so encompassing that it blots out the sun, an industrial fire can put an entire nation into an economic depression.
