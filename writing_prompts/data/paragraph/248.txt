The camera pans upwards until we see a small group of children playing with wooden swords on a grassy field a ways from the beach. A woman stands in front of them, a sword fighting teacher. The camera continues upwards. We see a small castle, with a balcony over the field. Two figures sit on the balcony, indistinguishable. The camera glimpses a reflection off a golden hand.
