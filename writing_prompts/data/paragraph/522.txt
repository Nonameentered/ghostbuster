Part of me is glad she got off that easy, we ’ ve all heard the classic tales, people appearing on the local news every Christmas day telling the harrowing tale how a gift mutilated them and showed them the error of their ways. But that ’ s all bullshit, you can see it in their eyes, it ’ s fear motivating them to tell their tales. There ’ s nothing they wouldn ’ t give to have back their hands, their eyes, their legs, they ’ d all happily be the same scumbags they were before their gift was dropped off.
