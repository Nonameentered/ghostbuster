I resolve to step down and to delegate my authority to someone else, whilst investing in provided measure in order to ensure the safety and protection of my country and its citizens. This will be done through the implementation of a robust security plan that will regulate the country's borders, monitor its internal security, and identify those who pose a threat to the state and its inhabitants. This plan should also include measures to help ensure the monitoring of illegal immigrants, as well as initiatives to aid the integration of citizens within the community. Furthermore, I will look to invest in building and strengthening my country's economy, in order to give citizens more access to opportunities in order to increase their quality of life and to encourage others to come to the country and join the population.
