However, as I began to overtly note it, I saw a sight on the screen as the cosmonaut's feed didn't showcase the interior of the ship, but *an actual being* poking out from inside. Crothers had his hands extended, showing he had nothing in his hands, unlike our guest, who had a glowing weapon in her own. It wasn't the fact that he had a clearly advanced piece of technology, but it was another person. A *human woman*, with what looked like a suit intended for vacuum combat, yelling at us silently from behind her helmet.
