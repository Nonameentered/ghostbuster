But Jesus. I hate. Hate hate hate hate. Hate more than I have hated anything else. Hate more than I hate terrorism and ebola and Donald Trump ’ s political campaign. Fucking hate the lack of variety in my meals. Sure, I ’ ve lost fifteen pounds. Sure, it ’ s cheaper in the long run. And sure, I don ’ t have to deal with the hassle of finding a new home for my crying, screaming shit-monsters. But I really miss solid food. Real food. Food I can chew up. Steak. Crusty warm bread with the soft chewy inside that I have gnash with my molars into a glutenous blob before I can swallow it down. It ’ s awful.
