My life is an example of this. I come from a place where coal is the only commodityâ€”a place I call Death's Holler. Everyone here knows of our situation. We are surrounded by rich ground that wants nothing else to do with us. We were a great people back then. We had our traditions, our culture, and our own kind of respect. We were miners, and the coal was our currency. It was something we could offer to the world.
