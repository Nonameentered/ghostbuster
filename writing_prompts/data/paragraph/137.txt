“ Yes, I ’ m sorry to bother you but I just need help. My daughter was just struck by lightning while standing under a tree during a thunderstorm. I need help! ”  The 911 operator told us an ambulance was on its way, and I felt myself gradually coming to. I opened my eyes and looked around, the world seeming hazy and unreal, like I was suddenly in a dream. My mom ’ s voice sounded muffled, and my brother and sister were huddled together, looking scared and confused.  The ambulance arrived shortly after, and I remember feeling my body jolt as I was lifted onto the stretcher. I closed my eyes as I was wheeled out, an unexplained feeling of determination coursing through me.  Once inside, I managed to speak a few words to the EMT.
