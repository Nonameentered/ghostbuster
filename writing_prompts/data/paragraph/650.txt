And then something strange happened. I heard the cat meow again, but this wasn't his regular meow, this meow was deeper and more intelligible. It sounded almost like he was trying to speak in a human tongue. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I sat up in bed and looked at him and he was meowing again.
