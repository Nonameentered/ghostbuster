General Bolden made his way to the antechamber, as he had done twice before. He recalled with amusement how Presidents Bush and Obama simply laughed at him before carrying on with the briefing, just as his predecessors recalled tales of 'The Revelation' dating all the way back to the Johnson administration. It began as a dare, something two drunken scientists made in a Houston bar back in the days of the Mercury program. If either of them made it to the office of the Administrator, they would assemble some official-looking presentation and bring it in for the President's in-brief. Something in private, very secret, plenty of pomp and circumstance for what would really just be an icebreaker at the beginning of a long and boring meeting.
