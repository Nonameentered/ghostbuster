Both those asleep and those awake alike had a single question, however: Why did this happen? Was this the result of some sort of terrible mistake? Or was it intentional?  We searched for answers, but none were found. We scoured the land, looking for someone or something that could explain what had happened. But nothing fit the pieces together. We were left with more questions instead of answers.  We also searched for a possible link between us, some kind of common thread that could connect us all. We looked at religion, at geography, even at shopping habits. But still, nothing surfaced. It seemed any potential link was forever lost.
