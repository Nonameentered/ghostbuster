The Platoon started to breathe easier and a few of the soldiers cheered. William stood up and watched the gas slowly clearing. He smiled at the Mage, who hung his hands in fatigue. He collapsed against the wall and without William needing to tell him, two of the ranks kept his body reclined. William stepped into the middle of the trench and grabbed a rifle which had been discarded, most likely in the panic before. He checked the bullets and the clip, *click*, the sound echoed through the trench. William began walking along the trench, double-checking for any Germans movements outside of the gas. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a figure moving in the shadows. He assumed it was another soldier coming back from patrol, or at least he hoped it was. However, as he tilted his head, he could tell that it was no soldier. It was an enemy Magus, cloaked in black and wearing what appeared to be the latest in German Mage technology. Before he could shout a warning, the Magus threw a yellow aura over his hands, and a grenade landed in the middle of the trench.
