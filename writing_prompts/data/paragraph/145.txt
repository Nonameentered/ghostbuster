A part of me feels relieved when the head rolls away from me. It's done. The deed is finished and I can start to move on. But I know there is still so much left to do.  I look around and see the other people in the room. They are all scared of me now, and I can almost feel the judgment radiating off of them. It's a strange feeling, being seen as both the villain and the hero in the same moment.  I shake off the feeling and take a deep breath. I can do this. I have to do this. I was put here for a reason, and I'm not going to let anyone down.  I grab my blade and survey the room. There are three people here, all of them obviously shaken by my presence. The first is a jock, the kind of guy you see in movies who always gets the girl. The second is an older man, probably in his fifties. His face shows a lifetime of regret. The third is a woman, younger than the other two. She looks scared, but she also looks determined.
