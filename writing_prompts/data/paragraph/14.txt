I arrive at the bridge, the hub of the vessel: the place where it's always humming with activity. It's a bit quieter than usual today, however. A lone figure stands at the window, looking out at the stars. It's my shipmate, Dale Malkowitz. He's an old-timer, been on this vessel since before I got here. He's always been kind to me, despite the fact that he's orders of magnitude more experienced in spacefare.
