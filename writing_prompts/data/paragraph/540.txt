It was the 99th year, the one that marked the end of 'The Gods', of the ruling classes. Mankind had decided to end old rules, old hierarchies, but we were somehow still bound together by something. Maybe it was just the spirits of the old kings, or maybe something more- I'll never know. We had decided to create a fair future. Thus the Candidates were chosen, five of us from all different nations, creeds, genders. We were the prototype, the test run for the rest of humanity; torn from our homes, our families, our friends. In search of something better. In search of something greater.
