The blade digs deep through the fat of his neck with a sickening thud. I can smell the copperyness of the blood as it oozes out of him. I take a deep breath and force myself to keep looking. I can do this. *Yes, you can do this. It needs to be done.*  I got thrown off my feet, and I started running. I'd seen what they were doing to our possessions... they were getting away with our stuff. I needed to catch them before they got too far. I was almost there when I felt the icy grip of cold steel pressed against my back. It was one of the robbers, and he told me to stop. I didn't want to, but I couldn't do anything. He had a gun to my head. "Where's your money?" he shouted.  My pulse raced. I knew I needed to act, but what could I do? He had me cornered. I had to think of something, and fast. The gun was still pointed at me as he grabbed me by the neck and forced me back. That's when I noticed the window. It was open, and there was no one in sight. He forced me forward, and I stepped up to the window. In one swift motion, I jumped through it, sending shards of glass everywhere.  The robber was too shocked to react, he couldn't fire his gun. I heard him shout after me, but I didn't stay to listen. I had to get away.  Whitney, my friend, was right behind me. She had been watching the whole time, and she quickly followed me out the window. We both landed in the garden, and started running for the house. It felt like we were in slow motion, our feet barely skimming the ground. I could feel the sweat dripping down my back, but I kept running.
