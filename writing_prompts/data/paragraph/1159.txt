She didn't understand what was happening, but she could feel a slow, but steady pulse coming from his chest. She got up and grabbed the stethoscope, which confirmed that he was breathing, although very shallow. Claire had no idea what was going on, but immediately started performing CPR, desperately trying to revive the boy. After what seemed like eternity, the little boy stirred, opened his eyes and started wailing.  The relief was immense, and Claire wept with joy. She knew what she just did was impossible. The doctors told her she performed a 'miracle', but when Claire looked in the mirror she saw old age, exhaustion and sadness in her eyes mirroring the death of everyone she had resuscitated.
