The stark chords of Tosca begin once again; Scarpia ’ s motive is the first thing the audience at La Scala Opera hear. Perhaps they are jaded by it, but it still elicits within me feelings from a bygone life. Soon we ’ ll see entrances from Cavaradossi and of course our leading lady, Tosca, forced to do the unspeakable and murder one man to try and save another ’ s life. Poor Tosca; if only she had known that Cavaradossi was truly given a stay of execution, perhaps she would have accepted Scarpia ’ s demand for intimacy.
