I looked up to see a woman, hooded and cloaked, standing beside Emperor Kane. Her weapon pointed and ready. The light from the room's chandeliers glittered off of the metal. I had never seen someone take a stance such as her to a man such as Kane before. It was captivating.  My attention was taken away from the woman, however, as Kane's elite guard turned on him, guns pointed straight at his chest. It seemed like my action had little effect.
