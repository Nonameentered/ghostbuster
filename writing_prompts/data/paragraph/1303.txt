'Sarah!?' The voice spoke from the other side of the door. 'Yes honey?' She called back, the reports already starting to feel the effects of being put down for a few minutes. 'Are we doing medicine and engineering today?' Megan's voice was full of eagerness, she was just three weeks away from her college graduation.
