He put on his favorite pair of jeans, slid into his shoes, and made his way outside to begin his day. But as he stepped out, there was something else out there that commanded his attention. He couldn't quite make out what it was, but it seemed almost familiar. As he stared, the thing suddenly moved towards him. It was a woman, walking with a purpose. He could feel her gaze like a spotlight on him, and he felt immediately drawn to her.  The woman walked up to him and gave him a gentle smile. "Hello," she said. "My name is Amy. We go to the same school, but I don't think you've noticed me. I thought I'd introduce myself."  Joseph felt like he was being moved by an invisible force. He had never felt such a connection for a stranger before. He found himself wanting to know more about her.   They began to talk and Joseph realized how intelligent and interesting she was. They both had similar interests, and soon they were talking as if they had been friends for years. At the end of the day, they had exchanged phone numbers and had made plans to meet up again.  The days and weeks that followed were filled with deep conversations and laughs. They talked about life and dreams, shared their hopes and fears. Joseph found himself increasingly intrigued by Amy, and life seemed to have a newfound sense of magic to it.
