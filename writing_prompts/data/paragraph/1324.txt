It was as I held my head, looking at the ground and trying to think, that I noticed a wallet at my feet. It had some money, but most importantly a name. it was the man I killed. His name was William Miller. At this moment I felt powerless, all wanted to do was go home, take a shower, and never think of this day. But I had a responsibility, a responsibility to learn of what I did and how I could prevent it from happening again.  I tucked the wallet in my pocket and took a deep breath. For now I knew my purpose and it was time to face it head on.
