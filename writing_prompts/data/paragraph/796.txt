'A mole? But, sir, how do you know that?' Sergeant Taylor stuttered, his mind racing to comprehend what the major had just said. The major held up a piece of paper. 'This is from Secretary Jass himself. He is the one who alerted me to the breach in security.' He handed the paper to Taylor. 'You have your orders, sergeant. Dismissed.' With that, the major stalked away, his boots echoing off the metal walls of the hangar.  Sergeant Taylor was left standing with the paper in his hand, his mind reeling. He took it back to his desk and read it. It was a direct order from Secretary Jass.
