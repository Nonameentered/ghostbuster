I pick myself up, not bothering to brush away the dirt and dead leaves, and I ghostly step around the house. The moon hides away every few moments, leaving a painting of darkness. The entrance to the carpark comes into view.  Two figures race from the house, colliding into each other as they frantically rush to the getaway vehicle. They both jump into a white car parked on the far end.
