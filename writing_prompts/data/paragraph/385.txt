So started the arm wrestle. At first it was slow, but then it began to go faster. Both of us were yearning for victory, trying to overpower the other. For a while, I thought I was going to win, but I was losing my strength quickly. I had fought in the last aDAM Encounter, and it had been unnecessary. To think I had risked my life for nothing! It made me mad at the Cains, who were supposedly saving humanity. To make matters worse, they weren't making a scratch in the ongoing aDAM war. And even though their numbers were small, they were among the most resourced people on Earth!
