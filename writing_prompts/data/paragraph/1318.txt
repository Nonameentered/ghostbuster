I finally settled in a barren alley, trying to figure out what I have done. first of all I tried to remember the scene but it was too much of a strain even for me, I can't remember anything at all, as to why I did it, I don't know, as to who was with me, he told me that he was an ally or something, as to where I am, I don't know.'Why has this happened to me' was all I can think of at that moment.
