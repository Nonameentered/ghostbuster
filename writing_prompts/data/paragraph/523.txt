Yet that doesn ’ t change anything, millions of people die every year because of this crap, and we ’ re supposed to rejoice? Spread holiday cheer around, and wish our neighbors a very merry Christmas even knowing that there ’ s a chance that their son or daughter was maybe a bit too mouthy in school this year, and will be added to the ever-so-mournful Christmas obituaries. You ’ d think the death toll would ’ ve gone down after the first few years, but it ’ s still growing. Every. Single. Year. There has been more, and the answer to the question which all news stations ask when the death toll gets released is; we ’ re inherently assholes. You, me, your grandparents, all of us. None of us are perfect, it is impossible for us to be. But we used to embrace this aspect! We used to consider our imperfections to be what made us beautiful! Now? We dot our I ’ s and cross our T ’ s, we don ’ t say a mean thing about anybody ever, even when they deserve, we never curse, we always look both ways before crossing the street. People used to think it was our government that would turn us this way, sterilize our culture, make us all become non-thinking robots, afraid to act outside the norm. But no, it was him.
