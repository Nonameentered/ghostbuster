The boardroom was deathly silent. Commander Toby Harrison stood towering over the desk with a single printout in his hands. He looked at her with that familiar intensity, an admiration that had endured for years. With a strength he'd rarely revealed in such public settings, he placed the printout on the desk and spoke.  'That, ladies and gentlemen, is where I landed. Ellie, after the longest 12 months of my life.' His voice only slightly softened as he continued. 'My gift to you is the first footprint on a comet, made by yours truly.'  The room erupted in applause and Toby released a deep breath. Finally, the mission had been a success.
