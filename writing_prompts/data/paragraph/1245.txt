The challenger took a final swing and his wooden sword staggered against his hoof. There was a mark on the armour plaiting but it looked like bits of wood ground against the chitinous plate, rather than any damage to his person. The challenger backed off and dropped the broken handle on the stone floor, littering was not something he liked but the maintenance goblins would be round later to clean up anyway so it wasn't a problem.
