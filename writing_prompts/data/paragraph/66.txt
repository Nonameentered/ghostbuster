The next thing I knew, it was silent. Uniformly gray scenery stretched out in every direction and I could feel a slight tremble in the air. I could only guess that it was the shudder of a plane that had just experienced some kind of catastrophic failure. I was about to figure out that the plane hadn't crashed after all, but there was still something surreal about the way it lurched through the atmosphere, defying reality with every passing second.
