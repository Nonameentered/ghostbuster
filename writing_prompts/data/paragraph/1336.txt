Yes, it's true that humans do have very poor memories. However, the capacity for memory varies from person to person. Some people are able to remember much more than others, even though it may be difficult for them to recall things they learnt in the past. This may be because humans tend to form memories using various senses, including through emotions, sights, smells, etc. Another factor could be that memories decay over time, meaning that they become harder to remember the longer you wait.
