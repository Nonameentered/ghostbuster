With no other reasonable solution, I decided to emit martial law for the rest of my citizens to stay safe. To those who were breaching national security in the name of extremism, I issued stern charges of treason, and delayed the migration process of the remaining ones who wished to enter.  Though only a handful of people utilised the means of terror for their personal gains, the street seemed to be lightened with all of these immigrating men and women. Despite being a place of relative peace and solace, the level of revolt had initiated a strong sense of lawlessness and fear to other residents.
