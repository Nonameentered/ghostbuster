The Platoon stood up and grabbed their rifles with haste. Bullets flew off from the walls and sandbag bunkers that lined the sides of the trench. A few Germans climbed over the top and started firing rapidly, which caused a panic in the Platoon. William helped the Mage up and stood in front of him. 'Hold the line!' He shouted to the soldiers as he stood and loaded his rifle. He fired off a few shots, taking down a German as he heard another yell out in German, 'Gut Punch!'.
