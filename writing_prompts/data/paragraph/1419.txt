We Engi landed in this place, the hab we now call home. It was dark and cold, but the soil held meat and metal and the air held water. We built with what we had. Shelters of rust and brick, in an ever-shifting circle of huts and caravans. Inundated by pieces of forgotten tech, we took what we could to keep ourselves warm and safe. We salvaged what we could and used the rest for fuel or trading with the Offi of the mountain, the Secu of the tunnels, who still follow the old gods of insect and nuclear fire.
