The spaceship spun in the air before settling in the sky. An Arbiter appearing in the center of the ship. It wasn't a reptilian, but had a humanoid form, was covered in a shiny metal armor and had wings fluttering behind it. ' Dave Johnson, you are breaking the laws of the Union. You shall be judged for your actions. ' Dave took a step back, not expecting such a powerful figure to appear from nowhere. 'What are you going to do? Kill me?'.  The Arbiter shook it's head. 'No, this is not our way. We will absorb you to our fold and assimilate your species for the betterment of the Union.'  Dave slowly began to realize what this meant. He would no longer be in control of his own destiny. He would be reduced to nothing more than a part of a massive hive mind. He had lost.  But then, the Arbiter spoke again, 'However, I do offer one final chance.'  Dave looked up, unsure of what he heard. 'What is it?'.   'A contest of strength. You must prove yourself worthy to be part of the Union by defeating me in single combat. If you prevail, you will be granted a place among the Union as a leader, as we recognize your worth.'
