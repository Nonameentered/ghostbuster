Over the past week, I have experimented with different things, different emotions to make these creatures appear and disappear. I learned that they are drawn to negative emotion- they feed on something in the host's blood. Because of the little organ in my arm, I am aware of their presence. My hand doesn't phase through them. I tried picking one up three days ago and it stabbed me with its sharp little claws. I mean, if you had been ignored your entire life and someone just grabbed you, wouldn't the surprise force you to lash out? These creatures now know I am capable of making contact with them. Now they're going after my family.
