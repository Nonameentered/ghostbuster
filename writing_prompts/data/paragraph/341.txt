It was not Pitch, but Jane, one of the women from the company. Though she had never been an official part of the troop, she had done her part during battle to help get the soldiers back to the front without fear of retribution from her own country. Her home kingdom had many treaties against its own people entering war. Akron had always wondered what made her go against her home, especially to fight for a kingdom such as the one they were fighting in, but he had never asked.   Regardless of the reason, Jane had done her part during the war and now seemed to be here to do something else. 'I came to find you,' she said, 'because I had something for you. Pitch wanted you to come to the old coaching inn. He said you'd know why.' Akron sighed and nodded his head. 'Same old Pitch,' he muttered.  The inn was much as he remembered it, the lamp light dim and the smell of stale beer thick. The only difference now was the steady slurping and snoring of a few of his former comrades in arms stretched out between tables. Pitch was at the back, dealing a game of cards with a couple of women Akron didn't recognize.
