My father's business however, sold something different. We sold dreams. Not the fake dreams of false fame, wealth, and romance, but the true dreams- the deepness and dedication of true love, or the peace and solace of a calm and quiet life. Dream capsules, as we called them, filled with the strongest and purest forms of emotional content- love, happiness, joy, and peace, all stewed together and then compressed into a single shimmering capsule. It had a faint taste of honey, and a sweet perfume, but it was more than just that- we sold emotion, intangible feeling that could be experienced by no other.
