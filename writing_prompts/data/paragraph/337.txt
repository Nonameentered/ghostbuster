He was a good swordsman, but the army had just dismissed a legion of good swordsmen back to a kingdom who did not need a single one.

As it was, he and likely most of his brothers in arms were living on tabs and promises of payment. He was beginning to wonder how much farther he could make his'soldier's honor' stretch.
