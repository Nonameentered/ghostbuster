homes and gathered at the main intersection of our town, all of us just looking up, speechless. Even the usually chatty Harv was quiet, holding his head and looking so scared. We could all feel… something in the air, something bad.  Harry had come out of his liquor store, and a few of the other locals came out of their shops and houses looking just as confused. I heard a few muttered words here and there, like “what the hell?!” and, “what is that?” but most of us were speechless, just standing and looking. even Jones, the town drunk, looked sober and nervous… he was holding onto Harry ’ s shirt for dear life.
