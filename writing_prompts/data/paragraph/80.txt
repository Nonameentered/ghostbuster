Okay. First, let's take a look around. It's a passenger plane, nothing out of the ordinary on board. A lot of people, some with kids, a few sleeping, some talking, that sort of thing. No red flags, no sign of any trouble. Second, let's think of what could have caused it.  It was so powerful, it felt like something burning up. Like maybe some sort of fuel. Or explosives from an on-board bomb?
