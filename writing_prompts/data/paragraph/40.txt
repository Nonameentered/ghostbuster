Now I'm lackadaisin' along through these godforsaken alleyways, an' then I see this thing moseyin' along in front of me. I kid you not, this creature was like nothin' I'd ever seen in me life. Bright silver spindly legs like a puppet or a suit of armor, a hulkin' mass of darkness with an ever-changing shape, and two bright yellow eyes peaking out from the top of it, like it's lookin' 'round. An' it's just strolling along, keepin' its distance but clearly inside the alleyways.
