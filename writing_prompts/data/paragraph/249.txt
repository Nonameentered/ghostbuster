The camera now zooms closer to the balcony until we recognize the man as JAMIE. He's looking out to the field but is clearly not focused on what's happening. Next to him, BRIENNE is looking forlornly at something off in the distance.  The camera zooms further in until we see what BRIENNE is looking at. It's ARYA, the sword teacher. Her back is towards the castle but she senses something and looks up until her gaze meets Brienne's from the balcony. They both grow still, and the moment lengthens. Finally, ARYA looks away and continues with her lessons.
