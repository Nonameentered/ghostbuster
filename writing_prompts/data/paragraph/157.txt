I roll over in pain. I can see the faint lights of the car they came in. It's still parked where they left it. I want to stop them from getting away, but my ribs are broken and I can't move. That's when I hear the voice, someone is coming. It's Whitney again. She sees me laying there and kneels down next to me, her eyes brimming with tears.  'Cindy, what have you done?' She looks scared, shaken.
