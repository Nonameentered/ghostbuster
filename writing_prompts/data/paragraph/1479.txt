It almost looks as though the bones are grinning. I can not say whether this is an illusion caused by the lighting or by the skeleton's clothing, but I am met with what almost looks like a welcome. I look away, unnerved, before consulting my notes for instructions. The parchment is silent, so I guess I am to proceed unguided. I swallow and take three steps forward so that I am standing at the altar. I look up to meet the eyes of the stone gods. They seem to recognize my presence and murmur in a voice that is not quite real or imagined. *You have come. Now what do you offer?*  I hesitate, uncertain. Offer what? Coins? Jewelry? My life?  *Do not stand there, boy! Offer up something worthwhile!*  The hushed yet demanding tone of the voice causes me to take a step back. I look around for something of use and my gaze lands on the knife at my belt. It is a family heirloom through many generations, worth more to me than anything else. But if I offered it, could they even use it? What could they do with it?
