I want to share with you something that I discovered about myself that rekindled my passion for writing. You need to fall in love with yourself and the words coming out of you. It's very easy to get bored with writing, your plot, whatever. Writing, like cooking, needs herbs, spices and variety. If you cook a frozen burger adding nothing extra, that burger is going to be plain.
