I was there for an interview; I had been referred by a recruiter. The owner said he wanted someone who was 'efficient and reliable'. I had an idea what he meant since his desk had two chairs in front of it so he could 'interview' people directly. Instead of a normal desk, his was a bit raised, like a throne. He was looking for the perfect employee, one who he could control and manipulate.
