Finding solid food is hard if you don ’ t know where to look for it. There are still fringe groups of traditionalists who have all run outside to live off the grid and off the land, but they ’ re a select few and kind of culty. That weird stuff always freaks me out. And you can always find someone in some alley somewhere who ’ s got an old bag of Skittles, but that ’ ll cost you an arm and a leg and you might end up getting shot for it. But I ’ m just a normal guy. I don ’ t wan na do some backalley deal or sell my soul to some random Jim Jones wannabe asshole in Backwater, Utah (pop. 43 ).
