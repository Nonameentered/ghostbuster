Harrison felt a wave of relief come over him as he snapped out of his stupor. He'd been so close to breaking off the mission that he had almost forgotten it. He neutralized the thrusters and nodded to himself. He had to remain focused.  It was time to change his tack. He crosschecked his systems one last time before he tilted his head to the side. His eyes gradually adjusted to the light streaming in from the comet's surface. He blinked slowly, and snapped on a pair of polarized goggles to help shield his eyes.  He shut off the thrust and the craft drifted towards the subsiding gas jets. He drifted closer, and closer still, searching for a calm pocket of air near the surface, his reaction times increasing with his anxiety. He heard Mission Control's voice in his earpiece, urging him on, but he was already more in tune with the comet than his controllers back home.
