He thought about the way the stars shone, burned in white hot fury and how their tiny glints of light lit up the dark night sky. He thought about how tiny he was compared to their majesty, their brilliance and the sheer vastness of their beauty. He thought of how they became his guide when times were tough, when life's obstacles felt insurmountable.  'Sometimes I do,' he said, and he opened his eyes. 'It gives me hope, it makes me feel like I'm part of something bigger. A part of something timeless.' Cas smiled.  'Me too,' she said and snuggled closer.
