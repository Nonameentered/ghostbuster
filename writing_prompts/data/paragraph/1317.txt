Had I known what I was I would have responded with a standard response a cold blooded killer might have given a comrade, which is I do not know. The instant I saw blood on myself I grew into a panic, breathing slowly, heavily, realizing what I have done, and having this man beside me congratulating me about it. it was very unsettling. wait, unsettling is downplaying it. IT WAS REALLY FUCKING TERRIFYING. I was so confused I ran to the nearest opening I can think of in the crowds staining blood on the people around me as I shrug to run to whatever sanctuary I can find.
