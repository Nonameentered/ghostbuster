I open my eyes in a panic, sweat beading and then falling down my face. I look around and the sun in shining through the maroon curtains of my studio apartment. Everything seems to be as I left it the afternoon before, but there is a heavy, unfamiliar air in the room. I notice the throw cover I lazily hang to separate my twin size bed from the rest of the apartment has been ripped to the ground, and that the kitchen faucet rhythmically drips against the cold steel sink. I was alone last night like I always am, I think. No one has been here but me in over three months.
