I flipped the phone open, and I saw it light up. I don ’ t know how long I sat there, but it was long enough for my mother to walk past, and say she was leaving for work. It was only then I realised I was shorter. My back didn ’ t hurt. My mother left, and I sat there in silence. I looked at my desk, there was my old bulky CRT monitor. I looked at the TV, and it had a video player under it, and was also a CRT and took up most of the space in the cabinet at the end of my bed.
