'Uncle Brathe!' She exclaimed, glad to see someone who would help relieve her problem of nothing to do. Uncle Brathe was always a favorite. If Uncle Brathe didn't have a good story to tell (which he always did) or if he didn't bring sweets with him (which he always did) or if he didn't pick her up and rub his bearded cheek against hers (may the powers forbid!) he would still be her favorite. He still remembers how to play. As she ran to meet him, her Uncle lifted her off the ground and greeted her as he always did.
