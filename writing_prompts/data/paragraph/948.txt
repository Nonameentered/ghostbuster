'You killed her, Francis. It was all your doing, and you can't run away from it.' The man still didn't turn to look. He could only pant, wondering where these words were coming from. The cemetery was silent, save for the faint cries of crows in the far off distance. It agitated Francis further as he attempted to locate the source of this voice.  But then, suddenly, he heard the distinct sound of quiet footfalls, and far off he could make out a shadowed figure shimmering in the mist. The figure began to take shape, female, and Francis noticed a cold glint in the woman's eyes as she made her way closer.
