I was ushered into a dark room, where I see a man sitting in the dark wearing a black suit and his gold chain shining in what little light is in the room. I'm thrown onto the ground. I know why I'm here. The last words I want to hear come out of his mouth 'Where my money?' I start crying trying to explain where my mom has went. BAM! I get kicked in the face. 'WHERES MY FUCKING MONEY !?'
