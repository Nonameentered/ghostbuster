So after a few days of preparation I went out to discern what had happened. I followed the usual procedure. I went to the crime scene to look for clues. I collected all of the evidence from the room, and even the bed. Each item was tagged and bagged. As I looked around, I noticed a spatter of blood near the victim's nose. Maybe someone had punched or slapped him. I took a sample to send to the crime lab.
