Note: I just watched Episode 1 of Season 4 and haven't read any of the books, so I don't know what happens after that. Please no spoilers! This is also my first WP post, but constructive feedback is welcome. Also, just for fun I tried to do an unofficial screenplay format, hence the weird capitalization.
