'In the coming weeks, local hospitals will offer euthanization services for those who seek them.' I let out a shaky breath. 'Regional governments, if they choose to, may also seek the euthanization of people deemed unable to fully contribute to society during the impact winter.' I shuddered in disgust, but I knew the intentions were objectively good. The mentally ill and physically handicapped had no place in the shelters. Who would care for them? What could they be if not another mouth to feed? I hoped, at the very least, each one would get their own marked grave.
