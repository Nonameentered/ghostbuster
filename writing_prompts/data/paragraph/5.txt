Years have passed, and I've come to realise, that even I can be replaced, and I will never be able to understand the wonder that is life, and I'll never be able to grasp and even a glimpse of its purpose.  So I prepared for my resurrection, one that will set me free. Inbetwenn the spider webs and the ruins I found a small package, a present from someone no longer alive. I took it, and I opened it as quickly as I could. It was a phone, a slim and modern one, so different from what I used to know.
