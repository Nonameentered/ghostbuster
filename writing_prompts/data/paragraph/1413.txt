Hi! My name is Jack. I was a reporter for the 'Daily News'. I say I was because I quit about an year ago. You see right before I quit, my crew- me and my buddies, we were doing a report on hospitals. Strangely I don't remember which one my friends' idea it was to do a report about the toothpastes doctors used- of course now I know that it might even have been mine or none of us.
