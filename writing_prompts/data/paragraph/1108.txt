Two weeks later, I'm sitting in my apartment shaking from withdraw. I have been doing cocaine for too damn long. All my money is being sucked away by this terrible habit formed from parting to much. 'What have I done?' The sweat drips down my forehead as I hear my phone buzz. I pick it up. The text reads 'You want some more of the good stuff?' A giant smile grows on my face. I respond letting my dealer know that I'm in dire need of a hookup but, spent all of my money earlier. Kevin, my dealer, texts back with 'I can give you some now, but, you'll have to pay more when you do get money.' I agree. I get the cocaine and never speak to him again.
