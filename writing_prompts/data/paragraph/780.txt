The Greater American president was the last people I waved out of the door. Before he left, he pulled me in for a tight hug. I could feel the weight of the world pass off of his shoulders and onto mine. While he never had control over more than half of a continent, I think I could relate to him more than anyone else. I was soon to inherit the entire world. I waited for a moment in his arms, and he in mine. I suppose we both expected some exchange of words. There were none.
