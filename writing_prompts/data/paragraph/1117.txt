Oh the dreaded aglio. For so often I took it for granted during my time in Vienna. Stakes could be easily enough avoided with good planning (an internally locked coffin with plenty of reinforced steel between my face and the world that might wish to destroy me ), but the Austrians never bothered with garlic quite as often as they do here.
