I take a deep breath and tilt my head back toward the stars. *Not tonight.*  I'm not sure how I manage it, but I move my arm forward, machete in hand. The girls scream and scramble back into their car. I watch in silence as they drive away. The moonlight gleams off my mask as I turn around, and I can feel someone looking at me. He's angry, but I don't let it bother me. *It's over. You did it.*
