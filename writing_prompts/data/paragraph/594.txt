After a few months passed, we noticed a trend amongst the survivors that had previously gone unnoticed. Every single one of them had a receipt for a purchase from Bad Dragon, a popular sex toy store. The mere fact that none of us had put together the connection between the purchases and the disaster before was mind-blowing; we were all complete strangers, yet all of us had bought from the same store.  We tried looking into the matter further, but eventually had no luck. We searched all of Bad Dragon's records and could find no explanation for the purchases or for the destruction that had befallen us all. We resigned ourselves to the fate of living in a wasteland, never knowing the cause of our suffering.
