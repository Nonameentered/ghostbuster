I glance around. Dale Malkowitz is busy tinkering with some machine. There's no one else here. He's the only other person in this part of the ship, and I'm kinda hesitant to disturb him. However, the strange formation of the moon's surface seems too weird for me not to mention it. So, I walk up to him. 'Dale,' I say, 'Come look at this.'
