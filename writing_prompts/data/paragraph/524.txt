We ’ ve all turned into dull drones, just waiting for the axe to fall. Christmas time, for the past seven years, has been a time of stress and agony for me. Every year, I ’ ve been teetering so close to the line that I ’ d almost felt like I ’ d get dragged away by the jolly old elf within minutes. Thought about biting my tongue, not taking that swing when the guy insulted my mother. Thought about not talking back to the teacher, not questioning her claims when I knew I was right. I ’ ve tried my best to do as I ’ m told, I really have, but I ’ m only human, and humans make mistakes.  I made one of the biggest one mistakes of my life on the 25th of December, but it was one of the best. In the heat of the moment, I punched a man in the face, all because he made a comment about my mother to me. It was a spur of the moment thing, but sitting in that bar, knowing I ’ d sealed my own fate, I felt something I ’ d lacked for years. Peace.
