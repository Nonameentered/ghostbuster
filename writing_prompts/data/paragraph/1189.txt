'This world works off of give and take Red. The corporation does more harm than good, it may take lives but it gives even more back in exchange. The world isn't a fair place. This isn't some fairy tail universe Red... There isn't some end-all be-all solution that will result in the perfect world for everyone. If you think so than you are a fool.'
