I'm brought back to attention by a steady, soft light at the end of the valley. I make my way over cautiously, throwing a glance at the carvings at regular intervals. The torchlight reveals a single path, as though beckoning me forward. There is no door or gate, no warning or sign. I wonder if I should turn back, but my feet keep walking.
