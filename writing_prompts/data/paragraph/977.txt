I use the burger analogy when explaining writing to friends. I ask them: Which sounds better... A) Jack put a frozen burger on the grill. After a while, it was done and he ate it. Or B) Jack had before him a bowl. Ground sirloin beef was mixed with a beaten egg, Italian bread crumbs, worcestershire sauce, minced garlic and a few pinches of cayenne pepper. The charcoal grill had already been burning red hot when he added the soaked hickory woodchips on the fire. The patties were seared as the flames licked the side of the meat. He took a swig of the whiskey, it warmed his belly and reminded him of his father. He had always said a man should never grill sober.
