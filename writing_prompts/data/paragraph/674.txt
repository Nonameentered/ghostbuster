Oh god. They ’ re here. I see a pair of them walking up the sidewalk, hand in hand. I have to hammer faster. I hit my thumb. It cracks open and bleeds. It doesn ’ t matter. I have to protect this house. They ’ re coming up the driveway. Leave. LEAVE. They stopped to look at the rosebush I have out front. I ready another board. They judge my color-scheme. I nail it to the doorframe. The door opens. I throw myself back onto the staircase. A single arm reaches through the gap in the boards.
