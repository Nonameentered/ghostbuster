Sandy rolled her eyes again as she tabbed through Social media. The device, when inactive, looked like a clear piece of plastic that could be folded and stretched. It had no buttons whatsoever, because it didn't need any. There were no ports to plug into a power outlet (an out dated home accessory) because the device remained powered through solar energy. She smirked as her father continued to grumble at the kitchen table about how kids these days didn't understand anything and how the government spent too much time in other peoples business.
