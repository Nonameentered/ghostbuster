'Down! Down!' A voice yelled and the soldiers hastily laid on the ground. The Mage, again, threw his hands up in shock and the yellow aura illuminated the entire trench with a blinding light. William watched the explosion and his ears filled with the deafening scream of the grenade. He saw dirt and mud fly over the trenches, felt the ground shake beneath him, and started wondering if he would die this way or survive to fight another day. He knew the answer was neither.  Instead, the dirt stopped flying and the mud dissipated to reveal a group of German soldiers, standing atop the trench. Shouts and curses filled the air as William saw the Germans' hands grabbed the grenades off their belts. They started to slowly make their way down the side of the trench, rifles in hand and pointing straight at William and the Platoon.
