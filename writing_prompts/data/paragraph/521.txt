All of this should be such a joy, a wondrous time where people all around the world are brimming with love and excitement over what they might have been brought. But it ’ s not, I ’ m worried, I ’ m borderline panicked. Every single year, I ’ ve felt my anxiety grow as the temperature drops, all because of one question nagging me between the ears. Am I on the naughty list this year? And there ’ s no answer, there ’ s never an answer because we weren ’ t given a guideline, there ’ s no clear line drawn in the sand that we must not cross lest we end up on the naughty list. So we ’ re left to our own devices, trying to live our lives as best we can, but people slip, they always slip. There ’ s not a soul who doesn ’ t know someone who made it onto the naughty list, I ’ ve been to the funeral of three of them alone. I ’ ve hugged my crying brother-in-law after the small explosive took my sister ’ s life. And what ’ d she do? I don ’ t know, neither does he, all we can be certain of is that she made it onto the naughty list. And she was among some of the more fortunate.
