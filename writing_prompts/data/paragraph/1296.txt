A poverty-stricken man, lastly he, The most befitting wish sought out of me. I saw that brokenness had taken glee, So with me he spoke, what hope it could be.  No treasures of gold, gems, or brighter days, But the things true wealth will always outweigh: A loving family and a helping hand, A reputation free of any brand. Life bounded by no chains of misery's walls, A laughter free and not giving in to bawls. Store of joy set overflowing, life's ships, Not the fairest of gold can ever eclipse.
