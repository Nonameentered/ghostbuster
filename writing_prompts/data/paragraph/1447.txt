From above, Saluy might have seen hundreds of green and white pods, spilling forth the people of the Engi in a shower of humanity heading planetward. The planet was blue and white and the clouds were speckled with the gold of sunlight. It was a beautiful sight, but for Saluy and the other Engi, it was a portent of terror. For the first time, they were going home.  The old one turned to him and again, for the first time Saluy heard it speak. **You have been chosen. You must remain calm. ** Saluy felt the familiar chill run through his body once again. This was the moment for which his whole life had been preparing and yet his every instinct pulled him backwards, wishing he had stayed in the habs and domes, safe and ignorant of the fate that awaited him. He clamped down on his fear and, with a resigned and heavy heart, completed the ritual with which he had been charged. The old one pressed a vial to his arm and injected him with a substance. Saluy felt his consciousness blur and fade as his body relaxed against the chair, and the world around him began to swirl away.
