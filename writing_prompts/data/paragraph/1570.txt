But these shops are a dime a dozen, selling quick and meaningless gimmicks to a populace hungry for the sacredness of life, but too jaded for that same life to express any emotion save for excitement, sought after in a transient fashion. Instead, my father sold dreams. Put inside glass capsules, the dreams were made of the embers of memories, of moments so exceptional that they lingered throughout millennia, forever suffused with an intense emotion. Just take one of the capsules, and open, and the dreams well from within- the sights, the sounds, the smells, the sights. Like a dream catcher, suspended forever in time- eternal euphoria, Nirvana-like bliss.
