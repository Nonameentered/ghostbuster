'Mission Control, this is Solo 1. Approaching the dark side of the comet. Visual is still strong.'  'Copy, Solo 1. Proceed at your own pace, Harrison.' The thrusters kicked in again and Harrison regained control. He felt the tug of the comet, dragging him toward his destination, but he kept a steady hand on the wheel. He edged forward, careful to respect the comet's atmosphere. Suddenly a river of dust swirled up blasting forward at high velocity, forcing him to take evasive action. Harrison slammed his throttle back and rammed the controls the other way. The change in direction was abrupt and uncomfortable, dragging him off course and nearly out of visual range.
