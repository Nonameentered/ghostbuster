Of course, rumor has it the baby sacrifice was invented by a handful of unscrupulous cults who thought it was a good way to scare people and gain a following. Big mistake. All it did was saddle me with 250,000 screaming children. Of course, youâ€™ ll never hear about my volunteer work at the local orphanage or my commitment to bettering our planet for future generations, no, just the baby sacrifice slander.
