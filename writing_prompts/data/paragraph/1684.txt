The afternoon session was all pleas this time- Gary imagined the desire they must have given birth to in their hearts, the tiny spark that had brought their pleas to life, like wishes on a falling star. He didn't regret granting them; he liked feeling that he could help, but he was tired, and he tried not to let the heartache of human suffering swamp him too much.  Gary was just about to customise the most beautiful sunset any of them had ever seen when, with a flash, his computer screen filled with an error message. He had been logged out of the account, and no matter how he pressed the keyboard, no matter how he pleaded with the screen, he couldn't seem to get back onto the prayer inbox.
