Must've been out like a light for ages, but when I woke up, I find myself here. So tell me, Doc: are time travellers really that sought after as subjects of study?'Cause I know you found me in your fancy cyberwebs database thing and I can't be three hundred years old as my passport would say if I had one, but I'd really like to not die, y'know? What do y'say, wan na go and grab a beer at the pub?
