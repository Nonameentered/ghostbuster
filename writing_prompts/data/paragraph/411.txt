Gieta sat in the field near her house surrounded by daisies and sweet-grass, weaving the two together in absent boredom. This place used to be her favorite place. It was a place where any adventure could happen, where any story from the imagination of an eight year old girl could and would come to life. Not any longer though. The grass seemed dull. The flowers seemed listless. How dreary it was. She didn't want to be there anymore. Gietas train of thought was cut off from the sound of footsteps striding through the grass.
