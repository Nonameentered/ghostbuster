I walk now down an old path between mounds of coal, relics of a past life. Here, the air smells like an ashes, the trees bisect the horizon like daggers. Solid shapes crawl out of the shadows in the night. Statues, long-forgotten by their makers, their faces contorted in fear, anger, or despair, all too similar to the emotions I feel rising with the morning sun.
