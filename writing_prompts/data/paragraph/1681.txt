Of course, there were harder prayers too, ones Gary had to spend a little longer mapping out. He couldn't save the dying partner of Lucy, 33, from leukaemia- it was simply his time to go- but he could give him an extra moment of lucidity, and the strength to grab Lucy's hand and tell her how much he loved her. And when Andrew, 17, begged him to stop his best friend from considering suicide, Gary couldn't change the thoughts in the head of someone who hadn't prayed to him directly, but he could lift the cloud of panic from Andrew's vision just enough to let him support his friend and look for other sources of help himself.
