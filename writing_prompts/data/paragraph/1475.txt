I do not go to the market anymore; frequent trips have emptied our heirloom pouch of silver coins. My father, a strong man, drives the northern road on a half-broken cart in search of a new trade. We block the misfortune of the cold and dark with conversations of promised horizons. I learn of endless possibilities, and dad regales me with stories of gods and heroes. He speaks of Death's Holler. Of a valley so steep and so deep, that even the bravest of men hesitate to tread its path. It is said that at the bottom lies an alter to a forgotten god; long forgotten by us, but not by itself. He promises me that in this valley lies our fortune, for it is said that only the bravest of deeds will bring this god's gaze upon us. I am to go forth and do something bold enough to capture the eye of a forgetful god.
