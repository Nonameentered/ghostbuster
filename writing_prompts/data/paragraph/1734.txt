I tried taking people I knew first, friends, family, classmates, girlfriends, but the trouble was their brains just couldn ’ t process it. During the time freeze they would either run off and do their own thing which they ’ d always wanted to do, or they ’ d go catatonic with shock and not do anything the whole freeze. That might ’ ve been alright, after repeated trips they would probably get the hang of things and we could have some proper fun, but the trouble was after the freeze they convinced themselves it didn ’ t happen.
