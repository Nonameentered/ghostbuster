Saluy felt like his mind was on fire. Information cascaded through his skull, like a river of blinding white light. He felt as if he was being pulled apart and put back together again. He could feel every single ship system come alive in his mind, like neurons and synapses connecting as he turned them on one after another. He felt the engines come alive, the reaction thrusters flaring to life and reversing the ships course. He could feel the billions of lines of code that controlled every movement of the ship, and as they began to run more smoothly under his control, he could feel the ship speeding up, moving faster than ever before through the void.
