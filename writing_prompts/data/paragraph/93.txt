We both pretend to be looking for a seat and make it to the restroom end of the plane without anyone noticing.  Once in the bathroom, I wedge one of the doors open with a chair and push through. She's standing there, hands pressed against her face and I can barely make out what she's saying, something like 'it's real, it's going to happen'.  I take her hands away and look into her eyes. 'We can prevent this. Tell me everything you saw, all of it, nothing left out.'
