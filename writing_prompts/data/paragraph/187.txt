The unionists had argued for months over their new constitution, sign declairing 'Freedom, Equality and Justice for All'. And yet, as soon as the leader of the new unionist party (Dave), stepped forward and lifted his right hand, i heard a strange sound comming from off in the distance. I snapped my head to the direction of the noise and saw it. It was a giant reptilian head, emerging from the clouds. The crowd erupted in shock and awe as the creatures face filled the sky.
