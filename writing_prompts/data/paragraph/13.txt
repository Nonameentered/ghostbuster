I find myself looking out the window of my quarters on the Depth Reaver, a space exploration vessel.  The stars stretch out endlessly before me, a reminder of the grandeur of space. It's a sight that never fails to captivate me and leave me in awe no matter how many times I witness it.  But, this time, I cannot help but feel a strange sense of restlessness. Space exploration is all very well and good, but it can be quite lonely, and often times it can be quite boring.
