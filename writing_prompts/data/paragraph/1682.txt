Gary knew, as much as he enjoyed solving people's problems, that the real joy came in knowing he was working in God's service. Some days, Gary felt he was simply a middleman, channelling and relaying prayers to God, but at those times when he stumbled across a particularly desperate plea, he was reminded of why it was he was here- why he had taken this job in the first place. After dealing with the prayers of everyone from misguided teenagers to overworked mothers, Gary finally paused on a prayer from Leo, 19, who wanted to know why God was making him suffer, when all he wanted was a family and to be accepted and loved. Gary squinted at the tiny cursive as the words blurred in front of him. He leaned back in his chair, rotating his aching shoulder blades as he thought of the private pain his prayers were reflecting, day after day.
