Darn buggerer turns around on the spot faster'n my eyes can see and says, he says 'sure! I got your fire here.' And the feckin' thing stretches out one of his spindly legs and wraps it around me like a cobra and pulls me into itself. Devil's pits, that felt like I was bein' burnt layer of skin by layer. He sure got me with that. Good feckin' joke, mate.
