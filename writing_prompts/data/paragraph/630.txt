The most predictable part about them is that they don't expect to be seen. Sometimes I'll see one on the street, and I'll take the opportunity to study them. If the notice me staring, they freak out. They'll hide behind people, bushes, lamps, anything that'll hide them from one who sees. I guess they're told that they must always remain hidden, or they'll suffer some great consequence; I can't really think of any other explanation for that kind of reaction.
