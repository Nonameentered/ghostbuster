My resolve is to strictly enforce the consequences for disregarding my orders. To eliminate the unfair perceptions, manifesting an efficient and cohesive unit. Be this by means of disciplinary action, rewards, legislation, or any form of enforcement, I will assure its success and restore rightful order.  On the final day of the month, I had been warning my people of a fatal storm that would sweep within days; and they would not hear it.  I had been cajoling the public to have faith in me and trust that I would guide them towards shelter before the storm approaches, but they fiercely condemned my words. I was naive; I had thought that I had the rig to say the right thing that would protect them despite the present storms and Earth's shifting atmosphere. I was appalled.
