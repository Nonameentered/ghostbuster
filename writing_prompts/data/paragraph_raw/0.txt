So many times have I walked on ruins, the remainings of places that I loved and got used to.. At first I was scared, each time I could feel my city, my current generation collapse, break into the black hole that thrives within it, I could feel humanity, the way I'm able to feel my body.. After a few hundred years, the pattern became obvious, no longer the war and damage that would devastate me over and over again in the far past was effecting me so dominantly.
Unlike the cities and homes I used to know, they were forever developing, this one didn't, this one could wither away during a single night, no one cared, even if it was the centerpoint of a whole kingdom or the house you grew up as a kid, no one cared, just another ruin in the sand.
I have lived through civilizations, and with each of them fell, each and every time I picked myself up and marched forward to find a flaw in the pattern.
Acceptance, something so important. a skill that has proved itself worthy dozens of times, an ability that looks so easy to achieve, a gift, that I wasn't able to aquire in all my years, until now. When the ashes on the ground flew into the now empty air upon humanity's fall, I felt as if all of it's weight was crushing me. Ignorance took over and I searched years for a hope, a sign of the very same patterns that I used to watch reappear every hundred years, the very core of my will to exist that was now no more that I so strongly wish was.
If you have ever wondered if silence can drive people crazy, it can..
Years have passed, and I've come to realise, that even I can be replaced, and I will never be able to understand the wonder that is life, and I'll never be able to grasp and even a glimpse of its purpose.  So I prepared for my resurrection, one that will set me free. Inbetwenn the spider webs and the ruins I found a small package, a present from someone no longer alive. I took it, and I opened it as quickly as I could. It was a phone, a slim and modern one, so different from what I used to know.
I slowly dialed the number I was given, exactly 1729 years ago.
I could feel my heart beating faster as I heard the chime of the device signaling me that I have reached my desired destination. I slowly opened the window cowering from the person behind it.
Through the darkness, I saw the light of what I presume was a throne, I started walking towards it, but before I got to quickly a voice rung in my head.
'You have finally arrived' He projected into my mind, with the most chilling cold and unhuman voice.
This is the end, the mere end of me and my struggles, my life and every second of every day that I spent struggling to stay alive, struggling to make things right... I stood still as the figure approached me, I couldn't move, my mind was unfocused, my eyes were squinting, I could feel the freezing air creeping in, I could hear the eternal darkness whisper to me.  'You have been given a second chance, a second chance to make something different, something more pure and true.. Do not forget how fortunate you are to get another go at life'  The figure extends his hand, I held it tight and I suddenly felt my body dissapear, I could feel again.. I'm standing under the stars, one last time, I pray for a better world.. with all of my heart and soul.
Funny isn't it? Even by achieving immortality, death, is inescapable.
