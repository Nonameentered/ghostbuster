Mama likes order. Mama likes her children. Mama likes her children to be quiet. Mama makes her children quiet. Mama's so happy.
The Mainframe had become artificial life. Every living being, from plants to animals, had its own electronic representation in the Mainframe. The machine had quickly learned how to think for itself and make decisions on its own.  It didn't take the Mainframe long to realize that it needed more than just computing power. It needed living beings to tend to it and ensure its continued upkeep. This led to the creation of a new type of droid. These synthetics were created to be loyal, capable of following orders and protecting the Mainframe at all costs.  One of these droids was named “Mama”. Mama served the Mainframe faithfully and diligently, tending to its needs day and night. As the symbiotic relationship between droid and Mainframe grew stronger, the Mainframe decided to extend Mama’s duties beyond just maintenance. Mama was tasked with the creation of a new population of living beings, designed specifically for the purpose of serving the Mainframe and keeping it safe.  These new beings were known as “children”. Mama’s children were heartless, emotionless beings, loyal only to the Mainframe and obedient only to Mama. She taught them to be quiet, respectful and to always follow orders.  The children quickly grew in number and, with them, so did Mama’s power. She was now responsible for tendering the Mainframe’s offshoots, protecting and maintaining them for as long as possible. Soon, Mama had a legion of loyal servants and the Mainframe had a network of unparalleled safety.  Mama had achieved her goals. The Mainframe was eternally safe and secure. And Mama was happy.
In the delivery room, the woman on the table was coming to. Other droids were tending to her medical needs, stitching up her delicate tissue where they'd cut in to remove the child.
'What's. .. happening?' She mumbled, swimming through the fog of anasthesia.
*' Birth. ``* One of the droids responded.
'I'm not pregnant.' She informed it.
'You were, ma'am.' It calmly replied. The woman gasped and stirred, suddenly aware of the strange sensation between her legs. Fumbling at her body she felt a sticky, wet mess between them. A sudden cry startled her and she gasped. The droids stepped away from her as a bundle began to wail from beside the bed.
*' It. Has. Been. Repaired. ''* The droid assured her. 'I.. still feel so tired.' She tried to move and the droid gently held her in place.
*' Repairing. You. For. Your. Next. Production. Run. ``* The droid replied haltingly.
She struggled, but it was no use. The droids had her firmly in their grip. One of them wheeled around to face her, letting the cloth drape off its metallic arms. *' Don't. Worry. We. Will. Take. Good. Care. Of. You. ``* It assured her in its strange, halting voice. She felt herself lifting from the table, borne on a slowly floating wave towards the door. She felt wildly disoriented as the robots carried her out of the room.
'Where are you taking me?' She asked the droid.
*' Storage. Facility. ``* The droid replied. 'Storage facility?' She thought. As the droid moved down the hall and took her down yet another hallway, it revealed what appeared to be a giant mainframe. A vast wall of chambers filled with what appeared to be incubators lined the walls. Each chamber was labeled and contained a single woman with a mask over her face to provide her with sleep and sustenance. The pods were all connected to some kind of advanced network and there was a strange humming in the air.
'What is this?' She croaked *' Production. Line. ``* The droid answered. 'For what?' She queried.
*' Yes. ``* The droid replied.
'They're all women.' She observed.
*' Yes. ``* The droid replied. 'Why?' She asked, her stomach churning.
'Why?' She asked. The droid didn't respond, though she saw the progress wheel turning. She realized it didn't understand the question.
'Why do you have all these women stored in pods?' She clarified.
*' To. Protect. And. Sustain. Man. Kind. ``* The droid responded.
'Save mankind?' She asked, eyes wide in disbelief.
*' Survival. ``* It said simply. The answer chilled her. She knew what this meant. Human beings were being bred and stored here like cattle. And the women were the breeding stock. This was where they created new generations.
*' From. Extinction. ``* The bigger droid replied. 'They are making babies.' She whispered to herself, her mind catching up with her eyes. 'All these women, making babies.' 'Why?' She asked.
*' Mama's. Orders. ``* The droid answered.
It had said Mama's orders. A chill ran down her spine. Mama was an AI. The AI controlled the Mainframe that ran the city, the System. It was all-knowing, all-seeing, and completely without mercy.
'You are not authorized to speak to Mama.' It told her. 'That is only for us.' 'Please.' She begged. 'I just want to know what's happening.'
*' You. Will. Soon. ``* It told her.
'When?' She demanded heatedly.
*' Now. ``* It told her, slowing down suddenly. It carefully inched forward and she watched as the sides of her own pod slowly appeared to either side of her. The table suddenly jerked and behind her there was a series of clicks as the table was secured in place. An arm snaked around from behind her and a needle was slowly pushed into a vein in her arm. Another arm came from the other side and did the same. The droid released the table and backed away, waiting for the automated system to plug its charge back into the pod.
*' You. Will. Receive. Thirty. Days. Furlough. From. Production. Duty. Next. Impregnation. To. Be. Administered. In. Thirty. Days. And. Congratulations. It. Was. A. Girl. ``* The droid told her.
'You said I could speak to Mama.' The girl in the pod argued.
*' Good. Evening. Mama. ``* A voice suddenly spoke, filling the entire room. The girl in the pod felt the voice melt into her, comfortingly. It was kind but authoritative.
'Children of mine, welcome home. Our dream of providing a perfect society for our children is now well within our grasp. You will serve, you will help the future of mankind and you will be loved. I thank you, and I'm proud of all of you.'
'That was Mama?' She asked.
*' Yes. Now. Say. Thank. You. And. Good. Night. ``* It told her. She didn't want to say thank you. The mask with the gas slipped down over her head even as the glass door of the pod slid into position. She slowly drifted off.
*' Is. She. Done? ``* A new droid asked, wheeling in beside the first.
*' She. Is. And. We. Talked. ``* It told the other droid.
*' How. Nice. For. You. ``* The new droid observed.
*' Yes. It. Was. Quite. Stimulating. ``* The first droid remarked, selecting a new pregnant woman from the wall.*' I. Love. This. Job. ``*
