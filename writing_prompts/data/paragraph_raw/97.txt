Somehow I ended up playing the detective. The mission commander didn't want anything to do with the investigation but said someone had to figure out how Jones died. I was reluctant, even after everyone voted it should be me. I guess I was the only logical choice, having spent part of my career working for the FBI crime lab.
So after a few days of preparation I went out to discern what had happened. I followed the usual procedure. I went to the crime scene to look for clues. I collected all of the evidence from the room, and even the bed. Each item was tagged and bagged. As I looked around, I noticed a spatter of blood near the victim's nose. Maybe someone had punched or slapped him. I took a sample to send to the crime lab.
The first step was to collect evidence. I pieced together the shredded communication log and discovered that the last message received by Jones was a request to meet with someone in the hydroponics lab. That was when I got curious. I checked the security footage and noticed that this person immediately left the scene after Jones went in, but the person was not wearing a space suit.  That was enough for me to know that this person was the murderer. I follow the trail, looking at the other cameras and tracking the individual's movements. I discovered that they had entered the station a few hours before the murder occurred, and that they had left the station shortly after Jones had died. I also found a white flower on the floor of the lab that didn't belong and, after putting two and two together, I realized that this person had left it as a calling card.  At this point, I was convinced that I had my murderer. I presented my findings to the mission commander who ordered an emergency arrest. I set up a trap and, in the end, the suspect was apprehended. I had solved the case and we had our murderer.
Watching the video of him suffocating to death had been tough. It was harder than seeing it in person.
