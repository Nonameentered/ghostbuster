For years we had been warned.
The world was on the brink of global annihilation, and no one was doing anything to stop it. No one seemed to take us seriously. Food shortages, economic crises, and global warming were all problems that had been ignored by the world for too long.
People like William Cooper, who wrote about the aliens and their plan to take over the world, were silenced.  The full story, however, wasn't to be revealed until the fateful day of November 8th, 2021.
And then, finally, it happened.
At least, that was our plan.  The day of the swearing in should have marked the beginning of a new era, and a bright future for our country.  But our dreams of a utopia were quickly shattered.
The unionists had argued for months over their new constitution, sign declairing 'Freedom, Equality and Justice for All'. And yet, as soon as the leader of the new unionist party (Dave), stepped forward and lifted his right hand, i heard a strange sound comming from off in the distance. I snapped my head to the direction of the noise and saw it. It was a giant reptilian head, emerging from the clouds. The crowd erupted in shock and awe as the creatures face filled the sky.
Horror spread through the crowd, and as the president spread his wings and screeched at the sky, the crowd scattered like ants.
His words echoed throughout the stadium, the gathered crowd paralyzed.
Among those reptilians was Dave, who had been in power for centuries but the humans had never known he was from beyond Earth.
People ran in terror, screaming and crying in panic. Dave calmly, albeit nervously, commanded the reptilians to stand down and let the citizens go. The reptiles followed orders, but it was clear that there was something else going on.
From a rooftop, on the opposite side of the capitol grounds came the one who had fired the shot. It was a tall, slender figure cloaked in a white cloak. His long, pale hair obscuring his face from view as he slowly lowered the long rifle. The figure moved back behind the roof, unseen as pandemonium erupted in the crowd below.
Anthony, having pulled himself together, had taken his gun and pointed it at the nearest reptilian. The shot missed, but the noise gained Daves attention, who had quickly shifted his gaze from the crowd to the guard.
A loudspeaker boomed from the ship.
'Organics of Joo'el. We, the Grox Empire, have come to take your planet
'Thessss planet has fallen prey to sscoundrelss. They have taken advantagess of your vulnerability and ssisled you into ssubmission. That will end now!' The image then turned towards Dave who could barely keep himself from shaking in fear.
There was a few seconds of silence before the screams resumed, only to be stopped again by a strong voice from above.
Everyone was too shocked to move, too confused to even comprehend. 'You.. what?' Dave muttered. The figure in the holoscreen smiled, 'I've said it before and I'll say it again. Consent is irrelevant.'
A collective gas popped from the people below.
The figure let out a sigh of frustration. 'Organics, we have observed your planets progress and have concluded that global distribution is necessary in order to achieve global peace. Your planet will be modified to reflect our way of thinking.'
{We apologize for the interruption, but the Grox have reached your system and our authority is absolute.}
The creature in the sky seemed to pay no attention to the outburst and simply begin to ramble on. 'The Grox, who are currently advancing towards your sector, must be stopped by any means necessary. For this, we must utilise the resources of Jol'el, that is why we will be destroying your planet.' 'No, NO! THISSS CANNOT BE!!! '   Dave roared, a vein popping on his forehead. Beyond his rage, however, he was only met with silence. The goverment had crumbled and the unionists had been powerless against the sudden invasion of the reptilians. There was no hope and no other option but to surrender. Dave could feel his heart sink and he almost gave up. But then, a faint light in the sky caught his eye. A yellow light, similar to the one the creatures in the sky radiated, was slowly becoming brighter with each passing second.
There was a loud crackling sound, and then the sky filled with a bright yellow light. Every one of the silver chariots now illuminated the area that it was hovering over and seemed to be scanning the ground for something.
Almost immediately, the ground began to shake, like millions of rumbles of thunder were ripping through the sky. The chariots seemed to be trying to form giant yellow circles. But it only took a few seconds for the source of the destruction to reveal itself.
Golems. Big yellow eyes and glowing lines, creating an equillateral triangle covering the top of the golem's head. We had been told stories of such creatures, but none of us expected to see one in our lifetimes.
The constructs had four limbs; two long, sharp, primarily used for digging, while the other two had more of a crushing, hammer like use. Their large, metallic bodies were traveling on tank-like treads, and from their heads a myriad of wires and other instruments shone.
'What-! ?' They had no mouths or eyes to speak of, but they kneeled and their bodies and eyes started to glow yellow, as if from energy.  Suddenly, a voice boomed from the sky, 'Organics of Joo'el, we apologise for the unexpected interruption. We shall utilise your planet to halt the Grox advance.' The golems rose and flew out towards the horizon, leaving behind a yellowish light in the air.
'What the fuck iss thiss?! How did you do thiss?! !' The silver being seemed indifferent to Dave's demands and simply spoke.
As everyone silenty watched the golems walked around aimlessly, every now and then, one of them would observe their surroundings as if they were scanning it.
'We a unit of warriors deployed from Ag'ttar to halt the advancement of the Grox. We are here to either terminate or enslave you all. Surrender and accept your fate or face eminent destruction.'
The golem began to move, and with it a blue dome of light sprang up with it. The golem stopped above Dave, almost as if it was waiting for something, when the voice came.
For a brief moment, everyone froze. That was, until, the ground began to emit strange humming sound. { We have awoken.} The voice, if it could have been called that, was as if it had to be in everyone's head.
'WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR MILLENNIA TOBRAVE THAT ACHIEVE THIS PLANET! TAKE IT OFF YOUR SILVER HANDS NOW!'
The golems had all stopped moving and in unison addressed the crowd below, their booming voices muffled by the ground.
'WE SSAY NO! !!'
{We have seen them, the Grox, coming ever closer. We are here to protect you, we are the Interdementionary Arbiter Council, and we have come to put a stop to this.} The booming voice echoed throughout the crowd, signalling recognition of the IAC's presence. 'We wish to discuss the fate of this world with all organic lifeform present.'  'SSorry, ssilver boy, that wont be happening.'
'NO, NO! LISTEN TO ME! !!'
[THIS PROPERTY BELONGS TO THE GROX EMPIRE. PLEASE DISPERSE IMMEDIATELY.] The giant golem voice was almost robotic and sounded like it had not moved its vocal chords in centuries. 'The hell is this?!' Dave had now turned purple, a sign of being close to a lava-like state. 'The Grox Empire are a powerful species known throughout the universe. They are one of the few species capable of interstellar travel through the use of warp-tear holes.' 'SSO?! We will sstand our ground! I am the warlord of thiss planet and I will not ssuffer your invassion! We will take back our world! !'  The golems stopped in their tracks, as if they were considering Daves words. [THIS PROPERTY BELONGS TO THE GROX EMPIRE] The golems moved forward, causing a wave of fear on the ground.
'THEN GIVE US THIS PLANET! !! IF YOU'RE GONNA TAKE IT, TAKE IT, BUT GIVE US A FUCKING CHANCE! !! LET US PREPARE FOR THE BATTLE! WE CAN FIGHT! !!'
Suddenly, the ground began to shake again. { Oh oh} The reptilian crowd, the human crowd, the golems, the silver chariots, all looked to the skies for the cause of the shaking.
It was a sleek, metallic looking ship with a symbol of a circle and two horns clear on the front.  The ominous ship floated over Dave and the assembled creatures, turning all eyes towards it.  A voice filled the air, it didn't boom like the other, but it wasn't quiet either. It was strong, and filled with authority.
The vehicle had alien symbols emanating a dark purple light from the front. A hatch opened and a figure, clad in a dark body armour, slowly descended. 'This is an Arbiter of the Grox Empire. We are here to assess the situation.'
From the spaceship a small blue creature appeared. The creature was only 3 feet tall, with large eyes and pointy ears. It floated above the crowd, seemingly unconcerned by the tension of the situation. 'I am the Arbiter of Space and Time. I have been sent by the Galactic Council to mediate this conflict.'
The spaceship spun in the air before settling in the sky. An Arbiter appearing in the center of the ship. It wasn't a reptilian, but had a humanoid form, was covered in a shiny metal armor and had wings fluttering behind it. ' Dave Johnson, you are breaking the laws of the Union. You shall be judged for your actions. ' Dave took a step back, not expecting such a powerful figure to appear from nowhere. 'What are you going to do? Kill me?'.  The Arbiter shook it's head. 'No, this is not our way. We will absorb you to our fold and assimilate your species for the betterment of the Union.'  Dave slowly began to realize what this meant. He would no longer be in control of his own destiny. He would be reduced to nothing more than a part of a massive hive mind. He had lost.  But then, the Arbiter spoke again, 'However, I do offer one final chance.'  Dave looked up, unsure of what he heard. 'What is it?'.   'A contest of strength. You must prove yourself worthy to be part of the Union by defeating me in single combat. If you prevail, you will be granted a place among the Union as a leader, as we recognize your worth.'
The small craft opened, and an even smaller creature slowly began to emerge from within. It was an old creature, with skin a dark grey hue, withered and fragile like leather. It had a small face with two, huge, orange eyes, that seemed to be examining the situation. They glowed with a crackling aura, like scattered embers.  'I am the Arbiter, sent here to resolve this conflict.' the voice of the creature seemed to reverberate in Dave's head, as if it were coming from inside his very being. 'Your arguments are not suitable for this planet, and I cannot allow neutirals to halt the advance of the Grox. I will allow you to survive, but only with my guidance.'
'SSHUT UP! !!'
