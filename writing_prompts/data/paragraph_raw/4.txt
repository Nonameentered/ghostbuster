There's a magical moment between wakefulness and sleep, a moment where noise seems to reach a crescendo but everything is so calm right as you crash into the warm waves of sleep. As my eyes closed the only thing I saw was the time on the TV screen in front of me, faded blue numbers that read 10:34AM.
Unless your plane explodes. Searing heat tears through flesh and shard of metal pierce every nerve, for a fraction of a fraction of a moment there is nothing but horrendous pain and then there is darkness.
The next thing I knew, it was silent. Uniformly gray scenery stretched out in every direction and I could feel a slight tremble in the air. I could only guess that it was the shudder of a plane that had just experienced some kind of catastrophic failure. I was about to figure out that the plane hadn't crashed after all, but there was still something surreal about the way it lurched through the atmosphere, defying reality with every passing second.
9:35AM
I still didn't know what was happening as my mind raced, processing what could have caused the noise and fear I saw in my dream. There were no alarms or any other emergency signals in the airplane so I let out a deep breath, thankful it was just a dream.
I had to figure out what was going on.
The good? I'm not alone.
The bad?
I'm alone.  No back-up, no resources, no escape.  But I know what I saw and I'm damn sure I'm not wrong.
Especially if I'm wrong.
9:36AM
***** Within moments I was on my feet, glancing around to see which way I needed to go. My mind was spinning and my heart was racing, a million thoughts swarming through my head. I needed answers, answers fast if I was to save all these people before it was too late. But how?
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm not. Either way, I'm not going to go down without a fight.
7 minutes left.
9:36AM
Alright.
Okay. First, let's take a look around. It's a passenger plane, nothing out of the ordinary on board. A lot of people, some with kids, a few sleeping, some talking, that sort of thing. No red flags, no sign of any trouble. Second, let's think of what could have caused it.  It was so powerful, it felt like something burning up. Like maybe some sort of fuel. Or explosives from an on-board bomb?
That's really bad. Not like anyone would believe me.
9:38AM
My only hope is that I can find out what causes the whole thing before the whole thing happens.
***** 9:37AM
9:37AM
First stop? Bathroom. Experience an explosion is enough to make you feel the urge to... relieve yourself.
10 people walk into the washroom, one woman in the last stall catches my eye. We lock eyes and I can tell right away that she knows something.
The good news? I may not be wrong.

9:37AM
'You saw it too?' I asked her.
We both pretend to be looking for a seat and make it to the restroom end of the plane without anyone noticing.  Once in the bathroom, I wedge one of the doors open with a chair and push through. She's standing there, hands pressed against her face and I can barely make out what she's saying, something like 'it's real, it's going to happen'.  I take her hands away and look into her eyes. 'We can prevent this. Tell me everything you saw, all of it, nothing left out.'
She nodded, her eyes wide. She looked like she was in shock, like she might break down at any second. 'Do you know what it was?' She shook her head but her eyes stayed glued to mine. 'Okay. Let's take a look around.' We started walking, peeking around the seats and trying to find out what had happened. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary and I didn't want to start asking questions.
'Me too. We gotta figure out what's going on.' She nodded again and it was like we'd been here before. We knew what kind of situation we were in and the only thing we could do was try and figure out what was going on. I look around the cabin, searching for anything that might give us a clue. 'We need something, something to tell us what happened.' I said.
She shook her head.
9:40AM
'I smelled it.' I said.
She snapped her head towards me and thought for a moment.
'It came from in front,' she said. I turn around in my seat, looking towards the front of the plane, and that's when I notice the difference in the passengers. Most of the people in the back were relaxed but there was something different about the middle of the plane, people seemed more tense even though the plane was still on its normal flight path.
I looked back to the passengers. There were six rows between her seat and mine. Six rows of nine, that's... 54 if any math from school stuck.
9:39AM One row between us. In a plane that small, one row could make all the difference. 'What do you think?' I asked as we studied the passengers, looking for anyone who seemed out of the ordinary.
'Yeah! It came from in front of you. It came from behind me. So that means-'
'It could be a bomb!'  We both just stood there, not saying a word, for what felt like an eternity. Finally, I spoke.  'We need to talk to the people around us and see if anyone sticks out. We need to figure out who on here might have a reason to go this far.'
**** 9:39AM We pushed our way between people and stopped in the middle of one of the aisles. I scanned the rows of people, trying to figure out who might be the cause of this impending disaster. I could see the panic in some of their eyes, the knowledge that something was wrong and something was about to go very wrong. We just had to figure out who.
9:40AM.
Time was ticking.
*****
9:43AM We decided to split up and get a better ground report. I was the one to start. I stood up and walked back to the back of the plane, watching every face I passed one by one. There was the young couple, the older woman, the business man, the family, the group of young people.
We had to act. First, I needed to get to the front of the plane. If I could get eye level with the cockpit I might be able to spot any suspicious behavior. That meant moving twenty rows of people. She offered to help and start clearing the way while I made my way up. I wasn't sure what I was looking for, I was just hoping something might provide a clue. As I got closer the noise of the engines got louder and the pressure on my ears felt like a vice. So this was the inner workings of a plane... Now it was just a matter of observing.
But then I noticed something. Three people stood out.
A middle-aged man, stoic and intense.
A young woman, wringing her hands and biting her lip even when people weren't looking.
And an older woman with a slightly suspicious-looking suitcase.
'Those three.' I said under my breath. She nodded and we began walking down the aisle towards them.
But we needed to be sure. 9:43AM
We had to act fast. I moved towards the 'suspects' row by row, checking every passenger until I reached the aisle just behind the three of them. But how were we going to get them to confess if we couldn't even get close to them? Maybe some sort of bluff?
We had to think fast. **** 9:47AM I glanced around for someone who could help us, a flight attendant or something. That's when I saw the pilot and an idea came to mind. Knowing that the plane was struggling with a broken engine must have taken its toll on him. I asked her to distract him while near the cockpit while I snuck up behind him. As he was distracted I quickly noticed that something was off. Something was out of place. I removed a panel and saw exactly what it was. We had a bomb. 9:49AM I quickly alerted her and we both knew what had to be done. We had no time to alert the authorities or the passengers, we had to act fast. The quickes way? We had to disarm it ourselves.
'Everything okay here?'
That's when I saw it. A metallic cylinder with a handgrip, about the size of a small water bottle.
'Please, don't move. I'm an agent with the FBI!'
He wasn't holding a badge though. Which meant things were going from bad to worse.
