'By the thousand teeth of Scrolith, Simon, it's *hiss, roar, roar, claw!*'
I stared at Simon, my pet basilisk, with my lips pursed in a tight line.
'Sorry. Thought it was hiss, claw, roar roar.'
I sighed through my long-dead teeth,
'No, my lovely reptile friend, it's hiss, claw, roar roar. And rather than teeth, it's *three months*.'
Simon's tail lashed sullenly.
'Three months.' I intoned flatly.
He mumbled something unintelligible.
I glared at him, my eyes blazing like blue embers, then said sternly,
'Sorry,' he muttered again.
'By the Dark, it's four things Simon. *Four things!*'
I whirled away, my midnight cloak swirling around me imperiously. I'd been practising that for *years*.
'Alright everybody,' I waved my hands grandly, 'break's over. Time to get on with it.' The assembled monsters shuffled uneasily. Acromantulas scrabbled in the corners, whilst Driders clicked their mandibles menacingly. Minotaurs snorted, and Dark Elves sulked menacingly. I'd hired out the entirety of the Underdark for my performance piece- it was my magnum opus, a play about the eternal struggle between good and evil. By the gods, it was going to be *spectacular*.
I clapped my hands to gather their attention. 'Right, today we are practicing Scene two, Act One.'
The skeletal horde shuffled forward, all armoured in black and gold, weapons held aloft.
'Fredrick!' I shouted, pointing a black fingernail at one of the skeletons.
'Fredrick!' I snarled.
He cowered into the shadows. 'Come now, Fredrick. Where is your costume?''
*' Fredrick! ``*
He shifted again, trying to make himself smaller.
*' Where is your armour? ``*
'I-I-I-I... ' he stammered.
'Fred, where is your armour?' I repeated.
'Well, um...I kinda won it in a game of Orcish Roulette.'
The orcs laughed and cheered, the rough jangling of crude gold coins still echoing around the chamber.
'You there, with the fancy blade. You got something of Fredrick's, didn't you?'
He smiled, yellowing teeth poking out from beneath a lopsided moustache. 'Something came up. Supplying new armour would take weeks.'
He shrugged and grinned, 'Would ya rather have a tail of lies?'
'Tholo, this better not be true or there will be no play tonight.' He waved a severed hand in surrender. 'No man, it wasn't me- it was Thorg.' Lending to the shuffling orc, I scowled fiercely. *' Thorg,'* I rumbled. He hung his head so low his horns almost touched his boots. 'Yes master.'
My eyes fell on the brave heroes looking resplendent in their shining armour, swords held high, awaiting their cue. I grinned- this was going to be good.
'Vanguard, into formation!' The skeletons clacked to obey, assembling in a neat line, swords raised. 'Orcs at the ready.' The orcs picked up their curved blades, eager for battle.
The undead army scurried forward obediently.
The heroes leapt into action, hacking and slashing their way through the ranks.
The battle carried on for several minutes until the heroes vanquished the skeletons. As the dust settled, I stepped forward.
'And now, the half-man! Half-dragon! Lord of the underworld!' I bellowed.
'Ahahahaha! Your puny heroes cannot stand against me! I am the harbinger of doom' The dark creatures cheered and clapped, issuing deep-throated cries of 'Doomsday!'
Simon stared blankly into space.
*' Simon,'* hissed one of the dark elves, 'you're up!'
He snapped out of his trance.
'By the thousand teeth of Scrolith! *Hiss, claw, roar, roar!*'
We were going to need *a lot* more practice.
It was going to be a *very* long night.
