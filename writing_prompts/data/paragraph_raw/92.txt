A change of clothing, canned tuna, a loaded revolver, and a full tank of gas on his red'76 Mustang Cobra, that's all Thomas needed to start a new life.
The sun slowly crept up over the horizon as he set his sights South. Destination: Mexico. He had no clear plan, just the desire to start anew, free from his past. He had been on the run for weeks, and felt it was time to move on once and for all.
As he drove out of town, he passed through a lot of places where he grew up. He passed the old arcade where he once spent $ 5 in quarters just placing with his friends from sun up to sun down, caring only about beating each other ’ s high-scores. He drove by his old elementary where he once starred as 'the wolf' in his class play of The Little Red Riding Hood when he was 8. He drove by the carpentry shop where he and friend got their first job.
He remembered all the good, the bad, and the weird and drove faster and faster. There was no looking back now, he thought, “No looking back.”
As he drove up a hill and down the other side, his old life, his old town faded from the rear view mirror. Thomas not once looked back, not even when making a lane change.
