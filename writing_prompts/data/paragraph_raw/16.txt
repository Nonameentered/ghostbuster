Akron returned to his room, another day gone and he was no closer to finding work. He was a good swordsman, but the army had just dismissed a legion of good swordsmen back to a kingdom who did not need a single one. He might have found work as a Night Patrolman had his unit been in one of the companies nearer home when the war was over. As it was, he and likely most of his brothers in arms were living on tabs and promises of payment. He was beginning to wonder how much farther he could make his'soldier's honor' stretch.
He had nearly gone to bed when there was a knock at his door. He opened it to find an empty walkway. He stepped out to look down into the tavern and saw no one rushing for the door. When he turned back to his room he saw a note just on the other side of his door. It read, 'Akron, Meet at King's Fountain. I have work.- Pitch.' Akron folded the note. Pitch had never been a brave man in the company, but he was the most resourceful. What he lacked in holding the line he more than made up for in his scrounging after the line no longer needed to be held, most of which he kept for himself.
He almost left the note where it was. He's heard stories of wizards and magicians, of things more powerful and more dangerous than a warrior could ever be. But times were desperate and he had a feeling that whatever Pitch had -- it was worth looking into. He pocketed the note and left the room.
At the King's Fountain Akron took a seat and waited. After a few minutes he saw Pitch walking up the street, a grin on his face and an ever-bobbing cane in his hands. He stopped and spotted Akron, waving his cane in a big arch overhead. Akron knew what this meant and stood from his chair, waiting. Pitch walked by his rows of tables and chairs, smiling and nodding to the proprietor who smiled back. Finally, he reached Akron and clapped his hands together. 'You figured it was me, Sarge,' he called in a voice that was more a bark then a speech.
It was not Pitch, but Jane, one of the women from the company. Though she had never been an official part of the troop, she had done her part during battle to help get the soldiers back to the front without fear of retribution from her own country. Her home kingdom had many treaties against its own people entering war. Akron had always wondered what made her go against her home, especially to fight for a kingdom such as the one they were fighting in, but he had never asked.   Regardless of the reason, Jane had done her part during the war and now seemed to be here to do something else. 'I came to find you,' she said, 'because I had something for you. Pitch wanted you to come to the old coaching inn. He said you'd know why.' Akron sighed and nodded his head. 'Same old Pitch,' he muttered.  The inn was much as he remembered it, the lamp light dim and the smell of stale beer thick. The only difference now was the steady slurping and snoring of a few of his former comrades in arms stretched out between tables. Pitch was at the back, dealing a game of cards with a couple of women Akron didn't recognize.
Pitch smiled, revealing several chipped teeth, 'Should've known you'd show, Sarge.' He held up a deck of cards, 'I got time to play for money?'
'Pitch,' Akron said, 'Why'd you call me out here?'
'Have a drink, Sarge,' Pitch said, reaching for the bottle of ale he had hidden in his coat.
Akron stepped back, his hands shaking, 'What do you want me for?' he demanded.
Pitch scratched the back of his head, 'Let me rephrase. I work with a small Mage School, they need a sword and a set of eyes to guard the school when they send representatives to other Schools,' he said, 'tougher and more dangerous than we thought. So we need a few good people to keep our people safe.'
Akron grimaced. He knew Pitch was a rat, but this was too much. 'What does the Mage school want with me?' he asked.
'Sarge, it's just a power play. This school's not a big one, they just need to bring up their numbers a bit at the meeting,' Pitch said, shrugging his shoulders.
Akron sighed, 'What do they want?'
Pitch swallowed, 'It's the Mages Circle. The Council of Seven.' Akron stepped back, 'What in the hells did you get yourself into?'
Pitch glanced over his shoulders, 'The Archmage's meeting,' he said lowly. Akron could feel his neck hair rise.
Pitch looked around before he spoke again. 'One of the other smaller schools called a meeting. Seems they're tryin' to show they got power and want to take their seat at the Wizard's table.' 'And how does me being there put you in anyone's good graces?' Akron asked, folding his arms in front of him. 'Cause I'm putting together a show of force,' Pitch said, already shifting his weight from one foot to the other. 'I'm hoping to create a room full of powerful wizards and warriors, but I can't do it without someone to command the others.'
Akron sighed. He knew he was on dangerous ground now. 'So you want me to bring a band of swordsmen with you, make yourselves look tougher?' he asked.
Pitch held his hands out, 'They ain't lookin' for no one special, Sarge- just another face in the table. But if that face can look like he knows how to handle himself, then maybe the Archmage takes them a little more serious. It's worked before, it'll work again.' 'You need more than one face, Pitch,' Akron said, fishing for information. 'Nine more,' Pitch said, then quickly added, 'Corporal Akara too. He's still looking, I thought you might want to know.'
Akron eyes narrowed, 'All of them?' He demanded.
Pitch nodded, 'The pay's good, Sarge, really good. I didn't know what else to do. The guys were so down. I just wanted to give 'em something to hope for.'
'Yes,' Akron said, remembering those nights all too well, 'And you want what, for me to be like the old Sergeant, whip them up into shape and lead them in front of the Mages?' Pitch nodded. 'Yeah, Sarge, lead 'em in like they were your old unit. They think I'm crazy, but it'll work. I'm sure of it.'
'Look, Sarge,' Pitch said, 'this ain't no rolling into the city, swords swinging. This is just bluffing and has no real danger. I just need you to be in the room when I talk to the Mage Council.'
Akron began to shake his head, but his stomach grumbled loud. A hint of a smile crept across Pitch's mouth. 'How much does it pay?' Akron asked.
Pitch pulled a sack from his pocket and held it out.
Akron looked inside and saw more gold than he'd seen in a long time. 'Fine,' he said.
'Good,' Pitch beamed, 'When do you want to start?' 'Tomorrow at dawn,' Akron said, 'the rest of the men should be here by then, I expect.' 'Good.' Pitch replied, a satisfied look on his face. 'I knew I could count on you, Sarge.'
Akron turned and was walking away when he heard Pitchs' voice again. 'Sarge, you don't have to get your hands dirty, just stick around. All I'm askin' is that you look like you know what you're doin'. You don't have to say or do a thing.' He paused and sighed, 'Why don't you come to the meeting and see for yourself?'
'Alright, Sarge, alright. If that's what you want,' Pitch said as he wrung his hands. 'The Archmage is gon na love you.'
