It all started on Halloween. I was an exchange student in Rome and me and some friends had gone out to party. I myself had dressed up as the Holy Father himself, Pope Francis. To be honest I looked pretty darn convincing. I had the glasses and I even had died my hair so that it looked gray.
One night while we were out, we saw an old man screaming on the corner. We were curious so we approached him and he seemed to recognize me. 'Hey, I thought you were the Pope!' he exclaimed.
He started talking to us in Italian, and then what I assumed was Spanish. Then he said 'Oh Americano. You need help? Come eat with me!' However someone snuck up behind the old man and stabbed him. He then ran off but a group of Swiss Guards chased him down. He was then caught. We then just stood there and watched until one of the guards came up and started talking to us. They then took me away into Vatican City.
The guard then took me into a garden and told me to stay put. He then left. I was then approached by a Cardinal who asked me why I was dressed as Pope Francis.
'Look can you help me? I'm not Pope Francis. Really i'm not him.'
'I see you've been working on your English. Preparing for your next visit to the states eh?'
'No i'm serious.'
The Cardinal then walked away. I was then taken to the Papal apartments and then the guard walked away. I then saw the opulence of the apartment and thought to myself 'It's good to be the Pope!'
