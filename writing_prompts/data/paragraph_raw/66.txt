Two blurry colors were making zig zag motions around the city. One is yellow and the other red. The yellow one seemed to be ahead of the red one. It was Eobard Thawne and Barry Allen running against each other. The city seemed like it stood still in time compared to how fast these two were moving.
They zipped around buildings and cars, darting here and there like two comets. Barry was trying to catch up with Thawne, but to no avail. No matter how fast he ran, it seemed like the man in yellow was always a few steps ahead.  Suddenly, Thawne stopped midway between two buildings and Barry nearly crashed into him. The Flash skidded to a stop, breathing heavily. He didn't understand, why did Thawne stop? He's sure that he was outrunning him.
'Are you done asking yourself the usual useless questions, Barry?' mocked Thawne. 'It's pointless to continue this as I already know the answer. It's losing speed that should worry you more.'  Barry looked down in defeat. Thawne has beaten him not only in speed, but in wit. He had no idea what he was talking about. What about speed, what about the answer? He's completely lost.
Barry looked up and saw Eobard standinge with his hands on his hips. He was grinning.
'I've done something, non-foolish Barry' said Thawne. 'It seems that you've won the lottery! Ain't that something?'
'You used the worst of humanity to your advantage. I hoped it wouldn't be necessary but it was.' lectured Thawne.
Barry was paralyzed in horror. He didn't understand what was happening. Thawne knew he was poor and he knew he needs the money. So he bought Barry a winning ticket. It was Thawne who made him rich! That's why Barry was getting slower! It wasn't the debt that weighed him down, it was the money he suddenly possessed!
'It was me all along, Barry! Me!' Thawne was hysterical at this point.
