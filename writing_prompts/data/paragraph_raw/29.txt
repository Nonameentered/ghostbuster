'Aw, don't cry my sweet little girl! You were so quiet earlier, even with all the racket my friends made!'
He gets up from his seat and takes a few steps towards her. He bends down to her tiny figure, barely visible in the dark.
'Shh, there there. I'm here. Where's your mom and dad? Let's find them, yeah?' He gently picks her up and rocks her in his arms as he begins to search around the room. Nothing. Not even a toy to show somebody was ever here. He furrows his brows in frustration, then looks up to the baby and coos.
He gets to work. He quickly grabs his laptop and sets down the bouncing baby in the middle of the room. With one hand, he swipes away the dirt and crumbs from the floor. With the other, he pulls out the supplies he needs for the diaper change.
He rummages through the shelves. Empty bottles and bottle caps. He grabs the wet naps and baby powder then turns to the closet nearby.
'There they are. Don't worry sweet thing, you'll be clean and tidy before you know it. I'm a cleaner by trade, and I'm the best.'
She reaches for her crying rags as he deftly changes the poo holders. He spreads the wet naps on the floor, followed by baby powder. He brings over a step stool and climbs on it, lifting her up. He reaches for the changing pad and wipes her clean.
The crying dies down.
'There you go, all better now. Your window awaits.' He smiles, realizing his little miracle.
He picks her up and cradles her close to his chest, swaying slightly from side to side.
He begins to croon a lullaby, she's breathing easier and easier. His deep, soothing voice runs through her veins like a gentle river, calming her down with each lyric. He holds her close and steadily rocks her back and forth, until she falls fast asleep.
When the lullaby is over, he steps back to admire his work.
'No child should die screaming, 'he said as he reaches for the same gun he executed her parents with.
