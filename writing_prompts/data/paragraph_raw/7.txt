“ Sadie! I told you not to stand under the tree in the middle of a thunderstorm! ”
My dad's voice boomed over the thunder. I had forgotten — I was never supposed to stand underneath a tree during a thunderstorm. But something inside me was telling me not to move. I froze in place, my eyes wide as the lighting struck.
“ Hello?! My daughter was just struck- “
“ Yes, I ’ m sorry to bother you but I just need help. My daughter was just struck by lightning while standing under a tree during a thunderstorm. I need help! ”  The 911 operator told us an ambulance was on its way, and I felt myself gradually coming to. I opened my eyes and looked around, the world seeming hazy and unreal, like I was suddenly in a dream. My mom ’ s voice sounded muffled, and my brother and sister were huddled together, looking scared and confused.  The ambulance arrived shortly after, and I remember feeling my body jolt as I was lifted onto the stretcher. I closed my eyes as I was wheeled out, an unexplained feeling of determination coursing through me.  Once inside, I managed to speak a few words to the EMT.
“ Sadie? What ’ s wrong? ” I snapped back to reality, my mom standing in front of me, her eyes wide with fear. “ Huh? ”  I scrambled to my feet, but my brain felt like it was on overdrive. Ideas seemed to be bursting out of me, without me having to actually think about them.
My mom looked back at me, a hint of recognition in her eyes, but the rest of her face read as one emotion: terror.
“ You know what else? I ’ m gon na get like, 50 windows from craigslist, they have the best deals, and make a greenhouse! ”
I looked outside, and it wasn ’ t my mom ’ s words I heard, but my brother ’ s.
My mom ’ s face became stern. Placid. And serious. She slowly leaned forward and looked me dead in the eyes.
“ Not. Home. And his computer is plugged in. ENERGY WASTER! Doesn ’ t he care about this house?! He could ’ ve burned the whole place down! ”
