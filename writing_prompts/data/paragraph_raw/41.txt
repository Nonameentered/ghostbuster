The sound of feet running down the hall echoes through the massive palace. A young Russian man yells out, pushing aside servants as he nears the Emperors private chambers. “ A message for the Emperor and Empress! Move, I carry a message! ” he yells at the slow moving servants. He pushes past the guards and throws open the massive wooden doors, “ My Emperor! My Empress! ”
The two figures on the bed look up from beneath their silken sheets. Their eyes feature of a soldier and a beautiful queen lay upon the intruder. The figures are both older, but the one on the left, is almost regal in stature and has a raw power in his eyes that makes the young man freeze in fear. The figure on the right, is beautiful with blond hair and a slim figure.
The two shapes stir, the smaller of them possibly being the Lady Catherine of Russia, consort to the emperor. The larger lump also shifts, displaying a massive body with two incredible, glowing eyes, reminding one of a great dragon looming over its prey.
The other figure slowly stands, turning gracefully to the man in the doorway. Emperor Care Bear, the powerful ruler of Russia, looks down at the young man, a frown marring his handsome features. Care Bear ’ s deep yellow eyes bore into the young man ’ s, “ This had better be good, Young Man. I assume, then, General Victor sent you? ”
The Care Bear sighs and rubs his tiny head with the paws of his furry hands. “ Very well, what does the General require of me? ” he asks, climbing out of the bed and adjusting the naval cap he adorns at all times. Empress Catherine smiles fondly at the creature and caresses his head, speaking to him softly as she does so.
The young man nods his head, tearing his eyes from the beautiful Catherine to the note in his hand. “ Um, General Victor says that there has been movement of Indian troops near Vladivostok. There has been a sighting of a Giant Death Robot, along with several platoons of infantry men and several tanks. ”
The Care Bear ’ s expression becomes grim and he turns to Catherine. “ What do you make of this? ” he asked, though he already knows the answer.  She nods thoughtfully. “ It seems that the Indians may be planning something big. Perhaps they are plotting to invade Russia and take it for their own. You must bring all of our forces together and prepare for battle. ”
“ General Victor also mentions sightings of American XCOM squads near Volgograd, My Emperor. ”
The Care Bear stops his chuckle and his face goes serious as he turns to the young man. He leaps over to him, face hardening to a mask of anger and terror. “ XCOM?! Wait, what did you say?! ” The young man gulps and nods his head, going through the details once again. “ American XCOM squads have been seen near Volgograd, My Emperor. Word is they are preparing to invade. ” The Care Bear ’ s face contorts in anger and he clenches his fist, shaking it at the young man. “ XCOM! Damnable America! How dare they threaten us once again! We must prepare for war. ” He turns back to the bed where Catherine lies, her eyes wide at the sudden outburst. “ I must speak with the generals and generals of the Army of the Great Peoples Republic of Russia. All units must be put on alert. ”  He turns back to the young man, “ As for you, you ’ d best have a name.
“ M-My name is Vladimir, My Emperor. ” Vladimir replies, standing a bit straighter. The Care Bear smiles and pats his shoulder. “ From this day forth, you are to be my second in command. Take care of the Empress for me, she needs someone to watch over her. ”
“ Vladimir Ufa, ” the Care Bear repeats, his voice dripping with malice. He takes a few steps towards the young man, claiming his attention. “ Very well, Vladimir Ufa, I will have need of you and your skills soon. Remain here at the Palace. ” The Care Bear’s voice lowers and fills with a menacing fury. He points a black claw at the young man. “ And, Vladimir Ufa, if you ever speak of this to anyone, your life is forfeit! ” Vladimir gulps, nodding profusely. “ Yes, My Emperor! No one will ever hear this from me! ” The Care Bear grins, though there is no warmth in it. He turns around and crawls back into bed, pulling the covers over him and muttering something about Capitalist Pigs. Catherine grins, her blue eyes scanning the young man. She motions for him to leave and as he turns around, she whispers, “ Maybe we will have need of your skills in other areas as well, Vladimir Ufa. ”
Vladimir blinks and turns back to the Empress. When his dull brown eyes lock with her piercing blue ones, he gulps and smiles nervously. The Empress smirks and makes a ‘ come hither ’ motion with her finger, letting the covers around her chest slip slightly. Vladimir is undressing and hopping towards the bed before the thought is passing through his mind. Vladimir has resolved to keep more than an eye on the beautiful Empress.
