He stared into the Distance, it wouldn't be long now... he could feel the presence of the Red Flame... and it wouldn't be long until he arrived.
Delta adjusted his helmet, as he stared into the green river below, the continual slush from the factory pouring in, tarnishing the clear blue coming from up river.
Delta had been in this position for days, overseeing the factory and making sure none of the workers got too close. He hadn't spoken to anyone for days, the only communication being a constant sub-dermanal comm developed by this company, to reduce the amount of words spoken. His blood rushing as adrenaline pumped through his veins, his thoughts breaking off from the dullness of his self assigned duty.  However, his momentary peace was broken as he heard a faint thud in the distance, followed by a crackle of red hot flames.  Red had come....
He arrived in a blazing fluorescent torrent of red fire, suitable to match the rage he currently held. Delta merely stood arms crossed at the top of the factory.
"It is time to show the world that I will not accept their pollution any longer." He exclaimed. Red on the other hand, shook his head in despair.
Red's face was stern and full of rage. The flames blazing around his body gave further testament to his fury. He had been here many times before to protest the factory's activities, but now he was here to take extreme action, and take it he would.
Delta exhaled. 'Have you no backbone Red? You are a Hero, you deal out justice, not destruction. This facotry has been proven guilty for many wrong doings, including gross negligence of safety precautions, but that does not mean that it should be destroyed.' Red stead fast in his belief that the factory should be destroyed, regardless of the consequences.
'I'm sorry Red, but the law is law.' Delta replied, his arms still crossed and his gaze not moving from the toxic pool below.
'What's more important? The energy of some, or the lives of many?' replied Red.
'This world works off of give and take Red. The corporation does more harm than good, it may take lives but it gives even more back in exchange. The world isn't a fair place. This isn't some fairy tail universe Red... There isn't some end-all be-all solution that will result in the perfect world for everyone. If you think so than you are a fool.'
'Fine. If you won't help me I'll do it my self! The Flame of Justice will have its vengeance!'
Delta sighed, 'Loyalty to the law is of higher importance then the lives of a few people, it is the only way to ensure global peace.'  Red laughed, 'What a joke... you may have been a hero long ago... but you are a coward now! Loyal only to the government that lies to you!'
Delta looked Red square in the eyes, his piercing stare heavier than ever. 'You have a right to your opinions, but that doesn't discount them from being wrong. We live in a world where the law must be respected, regardless of its faults. This is not a fantasy, it is reality, and I can not and will not let you take it by storm. For too long heroes have been allowed to abuse their power, and you have allowed it to go on for far too long. You call me
'Are you sure you wish to challenge me Red? I know you understand the consequences of such an act.'
'Go ahead and try.' Raged Red
Red lept into action shooting a flurry of fireballs at Delta, but they were all easily blocked by his superior skills. Red seemed to be stuck in autopilot, not even the slightest bit of strategy employed it seemed.
'Pathetic...' Quipped Delta 'My Turn.'
Before Red could react Delta had appeared behind him and grabbed him by the neck.
'You've crossed the line! You've broken the law too many times, you can no longer be a champion of justice. Not here, not anymore...'
Red engulfed his body in flames in a vain attempt to have the iron grip released. Delta Put his palm to the back of Red's head and much to the shock of the burning hero the flames suddenly flowed into Delta's hand, and slowly the fires of Red started to flicker and fade.
'What are you doing to me?' he uttered through a stuttering voice.
'I am merely giving them a more useful home. Don't worry, I will use them well.' Retorted Delta
Delta then raised his hand and directed the flames towards the factory, and in a single sweeping motion the whole building burnt to cinders. In mere moments all which remain of the factory was a giant heap of burnt rubble which lie in the river, slowly being washed away. Delta stood over Red's body, no longer engulfed in flames as he had extinguished them all, He was panting with exhaustion but still conscious.
Delta had used Red's own fire against him, and it had worked. The flames served as a reminder of the destruction he had almost caused, and in that moment he was sure of his own defeat. He had been humbled.
Red could feel the piercing gaze of Delta through the opaque visor. He never thought he could be defeated this easily. His mind had gone blank and there was nothing but regret in his mind.
'You are subject to the law, like everyone else... and you will be tried as such. Enjoy your time in prison. But know this.... your biggest punishment will be regret.'
