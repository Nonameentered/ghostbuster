I am the daemon that all men do seek,
Due to omnipotence that I possess.
I shall bring fortune to all lives so bleak,
To those who believe I do grant largesse, Though their hearts be blighted by their requests. Yet pain and suffering lies in my wake, For while time governs the fate of man, From my gifts in tragedy some partake, That can never be undone, alas, my plan.
A man of*outcast* once stumbled upon me, All he desired was a proper guise. From me, golden robes he wished and so were they -- Clothing of magnificence revised. His nobles spurned his newfound look mislead; Alas, repugnance rose from his peers. But his courage stayed and faith in me he pled, I in return gave wealth, no more fears.
Wealth that would squelch his every slack of vice, But for his wants that I brought forth, did fence
A man devoted in loyalty sought, For which, a kingdom I did bestow on him. But he forgot the wisdom he had sought, 'Bout how the power of authority dims.
And with a wish I set his life a-blaze.  Another man, of fields a husbander, Asked for just favors from *His* Lord I refer. So dull his life of frugal effer veser, I turned his hard labor to visions a-fÃªer.
A girl who wanted gems once found my lamp,
Though those mine form came with high a cost;
Refulgent jewels upon a chain were clamped,
Tight'ning around her neck when she sought sleep.
A poverty-stricken man, lastly he, The most befitting wish sought out of me. I saw that brokenness had taken glee, So with me he spoke, what hope it could be.  No treasures of gold, gems, or brighter days, But the things true wealth will always outweigh: A loving family and a helping hand, A reputation free of any brand. Life bounded by no chains of misery's walls, A laughter free and not giving in to bawls. Store of joy set overflowing, life's ships, Not the fairest of gold can ever eclipse.
I gave it all: eternal happiness.
