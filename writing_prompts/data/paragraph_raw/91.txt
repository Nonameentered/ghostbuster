The children rolled their eyes.
Sandy was having a typical teenage moment; She was rolling her eyes at her father's explanation of how technology and communication used to be. He was talking about how small, hand held devices were before cellphones and how they had to be plugged into a power outlet in the wall just to charge them.
'Yeah, but *did* you turn it off?' Sandy asked her father.
'No. But I should've.' he said sheepishly.
Sandy crossed her arms with a smirk and adjusted her glasses. 'That's funny, Dad. Because before 2020, these things were still pretty new. They weren't like the phones we have now that operate off of the Net.'
Franklin sighed. 'Yeah. That was the way it was for a while. But you know, these devices that we have now are so much better. They have a longer battery life and they don't need to be plugged in or charged. Plus, they have more powerful processors and can do more things with less energy.'
'And this was prior to the Online Security Act of 2020.' Sandy continued, 'Before that companies left their software with back doors that allowed hackers in to steal your stuff.'
'And the government.' Franklin grumbled. 'Now the government controls all of it. And you can't get them out of your pocket!'
Sandy rolled her eyes again as she tabbed through Social media. The device, when inactive, looked like a clear piece of plastic that could be folded and stretched. It had no buttons whatsoever, because it didn't need any. There were no ports to plug into a power outlet (an out dated home accessory) because the device remained powered through solar energy. She smirked as her father continued to grumble at the kitchen table about how kids these days didn't understand anything and how the government spent too much time in other peoples business.
