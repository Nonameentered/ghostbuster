SLAM! The ringing steel doors echoed through the the hangar as Major Harvey Johnson marched smartly across the empty space. The cyber Intel team had been taken by surprise, as no inspection was scheduled for today. They all stood nervously as attention. A man with more stripes on his arms than the rest moved to intercept the major.
'Good day, sir. Sergeant Taylor, CIC Intel.' Taylor snapped to parade rest, eyes straight ahead.  Major Johnson placed his hands on his hips, looking Taylor up and down. 'At ease, sergeant.' Johnson commanding tone gave Taylor pause.
'Sergeant Taylor, report!' he shouted, still holding attention. Sergeant Taylor quickly snapped to the major's side, saluting with perfect precision.
'As you were.' All of the airmen relaxed into their stances, and Taylor spoke up again. 'What can I do for you, sir?'
'I need to speak with your men privately, Sergeant. Is there a place we could speak?'
'You have one hour to get this unit ready for Overseas, permanent cycle.' He said sternly.
'A mole? But, sir, how do you know that?' Sergeant Taylor stuttered, his mind racing to comprehend what the major had just said. The major held up a piece of paper. 'This is from Secretary Jass himself. He is the one who alerted me to the breach in security.' He handed the paper to Taylor. 'You have your orders, sergeant. Dismissed.' With that, the major stalked away, his boots echoing off the metal walls of the hangar.  Sergeant Taylor was left standing with the paper in his hand, his mind reeling. He took it back to his desk and read it. It was a direct order from Secretary Jass.
'Sergeant Taylor. This is the Secretary of Defense speaking. You will comply with Major Johnson's orders, now!'
Taylor took a deep breath, thinking of the consequences of failure, and then met the Secretary's gaze. 'Yes Sir.' Taylor was ready to do whatever it took to protect his unit and the country.
Major Johnson nodded in approval and proceeded out the door without another word. The cyber Intel team quickly broke into action, verifying clearance of their stations and beginning the process of erasing their files. In a few short hours, they had complied with the Secretary's orders.
