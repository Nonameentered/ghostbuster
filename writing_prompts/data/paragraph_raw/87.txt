There are few that can compete with my father's business.
My father's shop, located on the cobblestone streets of the old city, sold dreams. Not the ones of riches and fame that can be bought elsewhere, but those of life itself. Dreams devoid of the horrific, those of love, of happiness, of peace, of warmth.
'*Become famous, with thousands of glowing fans, all wishing to spend time with you!*'
But my father's shop was different. My father was a dreamer, a creator of dreams, not the fake ephemera of the street corner merchants. He sold dreams, real dreams, dreams of emotions, dreams of passions, dreams of realities.
But these shops are a dime a dozen, selling quick and meaningless gimmicks to a populace hungry for the sacredness of life, but too jaded for that same life to express any emotion save for excitement, sought after in a transient fashion. Instead, my father sold dreams. Put inside glass capsules, the dreams were made of the embers of memories, of moments so exceptional that they lingered throughout millennia, forever suffused with an intense emotion. Just take one of the capsules, and open, and the dreams well from within- the sights, the sounds, the smells, the sights. Like a dream catcher, suspended forever in time- eternal euphoria, Nirvana-like bliss.
But these are hollow dreams, fleeting moments of pleasure, or maybe even danger, that pass through the minds of those that take them as swiftly as they arrived. No one ever remembers the people they meet or the places they visited when the morning sun rises.
My father's business however, sold something different. We sold dreams. Not the fake dreams of false fame, wealth, and romance, but the true dreams- the deepness and dedication of true love, or the peace and solace of a calm and quiet life. Dream capsules, as we called them, filled with the strongest and purest forms of emotional content- love, happiness, joy, and peace, all stewed together and then compressed into a single shimmering capsule. It had a faint taste of honey, and a sweet perfume, but it was more than just that- we sold emotion, intangible feeling that could be experienced by no other.
We make dreams. Dreams the kind of dreams one can't help but return to night after night, dreams that become more real than the waking world. Dreams that transport our customers away to new places and adventures, ones that they can scarcely imagine, yet can feel in the depths of their hearts and minds. Dreams that give their minds the kind of rest they'll never get, nor want, from anything else.
It was there, in my father's business, that I came to understand that dreams couldn't just be found in a pill- they had to be crafted from the ingredients of life, to mix and shape and hone until a masterpiece was found. It was my father's dream and our family legacy that I kept, an alchemist of sorts, spending my nights chained in my shop, cooking concoctions.
And it took me years, years of perfecting my technique, allowing my dreams to conjure experiences to the level I had always dreamed of creating- a true masterpiece of emotion, one that could be tightly contained in a tiny pill, yet never consumed by the avarice of the masses.
And then it happened. I had made the perfect dream- and when I slipped it into the capsule, I could feel my skin tingle in anticipation of the joy that would soon be brought to the one who consume it. A joy that I could only guess at, for I would never be able to consume my own work. But then an old man walked in, a foreigner from unknown land. He hovered around the shop, looking at each capsule with a keen eye, almost as if he knew what was within. And then he spotted it- the perfect dream. 'What is that?' He asked in awe.
'That's it, isn't it?' He said. 'The perfect dream.'
My heart stopped in my chest. I knew this story- this was the man who had purchased the same dream capsule from my father thirty years before. I had heard the rumors, how it had changed his life, and since then he had gone in search of another, yet to no avail. Until now.
'I haven't seen something like this since your father.' He said, never taking his eyes from me. 'It is the most perfect dream capsule ever created. I could not bear not to buy it.' He continued, despair filling his eyes. 'Please, lend it to me, just for one night. I will never ask you for anything again.'
'It's priceless,' I uttered. 'I can't place a value on something so perfect.' The old man nodded. 'Then I'll take it, and pay in kind.' 'What do you mean?' 'I'll exchange my own life for it,' He said, 'A life's worth for a lifetime of bliss.'
And he did.
He opened the capsule and inhaled the contents, slowly, deeply, while his eyes closed in satisfaction. He turned to leave, but not before I could stop him.
'Was it worth it?' I asked, unable to contain my curiosity.
'Yes,' Answered the old man, turning to leave, 'Yes it was. A happiness so great that it can never be attained in reality, one that will forever cast the rest of your life in shadow, knowing that it is false, yet the most real thing you can imagine.'
And with that, he left.  I was left in shock, not knowing what he meant by those words. So I asked myself,  'Why did he do that?'
The old man smiled sadly, and placing a hand on my shoulder he said 'Because, my dear boy, I am Death.'
