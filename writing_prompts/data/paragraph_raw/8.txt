I don't want to cut off his head, but I don't really have a choice. I close my eyes and just wait for it to be over. My insides turn as I feel the swing connect.
A part of me feels relieved when the head rolls away from me. It's done. The deed is finished and I can start to move on. But I know there is still so much left to do.  I look around and see the other people in the room. They are all scared of me now, and I can almost feel the judgment radiating off of them. It's a strange feeling, being seen as both the villain and the hero in the same moment.  I shake off the feeling and take a deep breath. I can do this. I have to do this. I was put here for a reason, and I'm not going to let anyone down.  I grab my blade and survey the room. There are three people here, all of them obviously shaken by my presence. The first is a jock, the kind of guy you see in movies who always gets the girl. The second is an older man, probably in his fifties. His face shows a lifetime of regret. The third is a woman, younger than the other two. She looks scared, but she also looks determined.
The blade drips with blood and I can feel my stomach churning. I try to keep my breathing steady but the smell is enough to make me gag. I know I have to do this, and try to shove the feeling of guilt and sorrow away.
*Do I have to remind you? Remind you how they came here -- to OUR home -- and ransacked OUR things? They are trespassing!*
The blade digs deep through the fat of his neck with a sickening thud. I can smell the copperyness of the blood as it oozes out of him. I take a deep breath and force myself to keep looking. I can do this. *Yes, you can do this. It needs to be done.*  I got thrown off my feet, and I started running. I'd seen what they were doing to our possessions... they were getting away with our stuff. I needed to catch them before they got too far. I was almost there when I felt the icy grip of cold steel pressed against my back. It was one of the robbers, and he told me to stop. I didn't want to, but I couldn't do anything. He had a gun to my head. "Where's your money?" he shouted.  My pulse raced. I knew I needed to act, but what could I do? He had me cornered. I had to think of something, and fast. The gun was still pointed at me as he grabbed me by the neck and forced me back. That's when I noticed the window. It was open, and there was no one in sight. He forced me forward, and I stepped up to the window. In one swift motion, I jumped through it, sending shards of glass everywhere.  The robber was too shocked to react, he couldn't fire his gun. I heard him shout after me, but I didn't stay to listen. I had to get away.  Whitney, my friend, was right behind me. She had been watching the whole time, and she quickly followed me out the window. We both landed in the garden, and started running for the house. It felt like we were in slow motion, our feet barely skimming the ground. I could feel the sweat dripping down my back, but I kept running.
*How could you let her do that?*
I like the feeling of being weightless. Bits of shattered glass encompass me, sparkling with moonlight. I feel like I'm floating in space, surrounded by stars. Then I hit the ground and I think I feel a rib break. I shift to make sure.
*Mother fucker!*
I push myself off the ground, barely making it into a standing position before collapsing again. My vision is blurry, but I see him and Whitney running out the front door.
As I lay there in pain, I can see movement in the room above me. It's Whitney.
'He's gone.' she shouts before disappearing back into the house.
I start to make my way up, despite the pain in my side. I'm on the run now, he'll come looking for me if I don't leave soon. I hurry through the woods and onto the main street. Cars whoosh past and I can almost feel their drivers staring at me as I stumble along. I tuck my mask into my shirt and make my way to the old convenience store.  Once inside, I slip into the back room and close the door behind me. I attempt to sit down but the pain is too intense, so I just lean against the wall and try not to move. If I stay still long enough, I can pretend I am somewhere else. I drift off, imagining a small cabin out in the woods. It looks just like the one in my dream.
My anger and determination return to me, and I manage to haul myself to my feet. I take a deep breath of the crisp night air and collect my thoughts.
I roll over in pain. I can see the faint lights of the car they came in. It's still parked where they left it. I want to stop them from getting away, but my ribs are broken and I can't move. That's when I hear the voice, someone is coming. It's Whitney again. She sees me laying there and kneels down next to me, her eyes brimming with tears.  'Cindy, what have you done?' She looks scared, shaken.
'Keep it together, Cindy. I need you to keep it together' Whitney's voice is stern but supportive.
I pick myself up, not bothering to brush away the dirt and dead leaves, and I ghostly step around the house. The moon hides away every few moments, leaving a painting of darkness. The entrance to the carpark comes into view.  Two figures race from the house, colliding into each other as they frantically rush to the getaway vehicle. They both jump into a white car parked on the far end.
I know they are heading to the car even before I hear the doors open. In the next few seconds, they will drive off, and I can go back to being alone.
Suddenly, the car sputters and fails.
The engine begins to hang, and I hear the girls swearing. They keep trying, but it's no use.
For a brief moment, I am tempted to go out there and finish it. They would never know it was me. Nobody would come looking for them. I could finish this and so many of these late night incidents would end. But I know better. It brings me no satisfaction. Plus, I'm still weak from the fourth strike. I struggle to my feet, ready to go back to the cabin.
I take a deep breath and tilt my head back toward the stars. *Not tonight.*  I'm not sure how I manage it, but I move my arm forward, machete in hand. The girls scream and scramble back into their car. I watch in silence as they drive away. The moonlight gleams off my mask as I turn around, and I can feel someone looking at me. He's angry, but I don't let it bother me. *It's over. You did it.*
I am too weak to fight him. He takes control of me, one limb at a time, and everything fades.
When I wake up, I am in the woods. It is almost pitch black, but I can make out a tiny cabin in the distance. I start walking toward it, but my foot catches on something, almost knocking me over. I look down to see a limp figure curled into a ball beneath me. She has blonde hair and a blue dress patterned with diamonds. Some of the diamonds are red now. I try not to think about her again as I continue walking.
As I approach the cabin door, something triggers in the back of my mind. I feel isolated, safe. The door creaks as I push it open and walk inside.
Inside, I find a room illuminated only by a single candle. On the walls are strange drawings of boys wearing space helmets. I want to look at them more closely, but the candlelight doesn't quite reach.
This one is of also of a boy, a real one. He is sitting in a wagon with a cardboard box on his head, cut up to look like the same space helmet in the drawings. He isn't alone, though; there is a man standing behind him. His face has been drawn over in a furious series of pen marks. Though I can't see his face, the man terrifies me. He fills me with the same kind of dread I feel every time I hear --
*Get up. If they get away, they will come back.*
'Cindy, run!' Whitney screams as she gets up. We both start running toward the window, but he stops me. He grabs my right hand and yanks me back, screaming in my face.
I don't want to do it. I don't want to hurt her.
*Suck it up and just do it already. You know what needs to happen.*
No.
*Do it, you piece of shit. Do it or I will!*
I try to resist, but I can feel his will flowing through me. His anger and hatred pressing down. I stand there without moving as he fights to control my arm.
I throw my machete toward the ground as his shouts fill the room. The force of it brings me to my knees. Even as I resist, I begin to feel him taking control. My right hand stiffens and begins making its way toward the weapon. Before he can grab it, I kick it away. It skids to a halt right next to Whitney. She picks it up without hesitation and lunges forward.
It surprises me that I don't feel pain when the blade enters my chest. Then a scream pierces through my skull and I know it has hurt him instead. I feel my body begin to go limp again, though nothing steps in to take control.
'Die!' Whitney shouts at me, but I don't blame her.
I don't mind that she doesn't understand. I don't even care if he does. It's only important that I know it, that I feel it in my bones even as my vision starts to fade.
I'm not the bad guy.
