'..the population is resistant Lord. What shall you resolve to next?'
I resolve to step down and to delegate my authority to someone else, whilst investing in provided measure in order to ensure the safety and protection of my country and its citizens. This will be done through the implementation of a robust security plan that will regulate the country's borders, monitor its internal security, and identify those who pose a threat to the state and its inhabitants. This plan should also include measures to help ensure the monitoring of illegal immigrants, as well as initiatives to aid the integration of citizens within the community. Furthermore, I will look to invest in building and strengthening my country's economy, in order to give citizens more access to opportunities in order to increase their quality of life and to encourage others to come to the country and join the population.
My resolve is to strictly enforce the consequences for disregarding my orders. To eliminate the unfair perceptions, manifesting an efficient and cohesive unit. Be this by means of disciplinary action, rewards, legislation, or any form of enforcement, I will assure its success and restore rightful order.  On the final day of the month, I had been warning my people of a fatal storm that would sweep within days; and they would not hear it.  I had been cajoling the public to have faith in me and trust that I would guide them towards shelter before the storm approaches, but they fiercely condemned my words. I was naive; I had thought that I had the rig to say the right thing that would protect them despite the present storms and Earth's shifting atmosphere. I was appalled.
With no other reasonable solution, I decided to emit martial law for the rest of my citizens to stay safe. To those who were breaching national security in the name of extremism, I issued stern charges of treason, and delayed the migration process of the remaining ones who wished to enter.  Though only a handful of people utilised the means of terror for their personal gains, the street seemed to be lightened with all of these immigrating men and women. Despite being a place of relative peace and solace, the level of revolt had initiated a strong sense of lawlessness and fear to other residents.
I was terrified. Why were they opposing their own leader...
I figured, it was perfect time for my personage to withhold my position
