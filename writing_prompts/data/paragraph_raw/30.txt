'Do you ever think about what it's like up there?'
Her hair was spread out on the grass. The cool night air had left them both with goosebumps as Alec fidgeted, trying to find a position with his hand on hers that didn't make it seem like he was nervous.
The city was a long way away now. It was her idea, to come out here, get away from it all. He leant back, other arm propped behind his head as he looked up at the stars.
'Sometimes,' he said. 'Do you?' She shifted beneath him, her hand still in his. She seemed content to lie in silence, and perhaps, if he'd been brave enough, he'd have taken the offering and let himself get lost in the stars. But the city lights still seem to haunt him.
'Is it?'
She rolled onto her side. In the dim moonlight he could see nothing beyond the reflections in her eyes, but he knew she would be smiling. She loved to smile. She took her hand, leaving his despondent, and placed it over his eyes. What little light there was before vanished.
'What do you see?' she asked.
He heard her chuckle, and it felt like a warm embrace.
'Everything is dark.' He replied, matter-of-factly. She hummed in response. 'Open your eyes,' she coaxed.
'Do you ever think about what it's like up there?' she asked. 'Floating around in the vastness of the universe?'
'Do you ever think about what it's like up there?' He said eventually.
The moon hung low, but the cloudless night was endless. Millions of stars floated in the heavens. The ribbon the milky way rose from above the horizon.
'It's beautiful,' he whispered. She squeezed his hand tightly. 'Do you ever think about what it's like up there?'
She moved to his side then. Her arm around his shoulder, tugging him close, and craned her neck up too. 'Do you ever think about what it's like up there?' He asked.
'Do you ever think,' she said, 'about what it's like, up there?' Alec's eyes fell closed. His breath was calm and steady. He thought about the way the stars shone, burned in white hot fury and how their tiny glints of light lit up the dark night sky. He thought about how tiny he was compared to their majesty, their brilliance and the sheer vastness of their beauty. He thought of how they became his guide when times were tough, when life's obstacles felt insurmountable.  'Sometimes I do,' he said, and he opened his eyes. 'It gives me hope, it makes me feel like I'm part of something bigger. A part of something timeless.' Cas smiled.  'Me too,' she said and snuggled closer.
Alec brought her in close.
