I was feckin' sloshed, mate. First time I ever was in the Big Lemon, and I'd found me the best feckin' pub I could imagine, I tell ya what. So I stumble out when it was closin' time, musta been'round 4 o'clock in the morning, and made my way through some alleys to find the quaint little AirBnB place I'd rented for the week.
Now I'm lackadaisin' along through these godforsaken alleyways, an' then I see this thing moseyin' along in front of me. I kid you not, this creature was like nothin' I'd ever seen in me life. Bright silver spindly legs like a puppet or a suit of armor, a hulkin' mass of darkness with an ever-changing shape, and two bright yellow eyes peaking out from the top of it, like it's lookin' 'round. An' it's just strolling along, keepin' its distance but clearly inside the alleyways.
Now the strange, cutty figure stops and I'm about to turn around and bolt all the way back to the pub, but then it stops and it just stands there silent-like for a few seconds.   Then it speaks.  It speaks in a voice like a young lad's but somehow inhuman, 'hey mate, you need fire for somethin'?'
Darn buggerer turns around on the spot faster'n my eyes can see and says, he says 'sure! I got your fire here.' And the feckin' thing stretches out one of his spindly legs and wraps it around me like a cobra and pulls me into itself. Devil's pits, that felt like I was bein' burnt layer of skin by layer. He sure got me with that. Good feckin' joke, mate.
Must've been out like a light for ages, but when I woke up, I find myself here. So tell me, Doc: are time travellers really that sought after as subjects of study?'Cause I know you found me in your fancy cyberwebs database thing and I can't be three hundred years old as my passport would say if I had one, but I'd really like to not die, y'know? What do y'say, wan na go and grab a beer at the pub?
