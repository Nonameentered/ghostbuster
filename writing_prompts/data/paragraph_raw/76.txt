The gas encroached over the top of the trench. William McKenzie's eyes saw the green smoke almost immediately and the words escaped his mouth, 'Gas! Gas! Gas!' The soldiers in the trenches, most of whom were taking a break from the battle and smoking on cigarettes, sprung into action. They grabbed their weapons and then hurried themselves against the dirt wall in the trench, hoping their Mage would make it in time.
The Mage, his instructor from the Academy, had been warned of the gas presence earlier but had not had enough time to shield the soldiers with a protective ward. William had heard the words 'Run! Hurry! It's coming,' amongst the confusion and he knew it was too late.
The Platoon started to breathe easier and a few of the soldiers cheered. William stood up and watched the gas slowly clearing. He smiled at the Mage, who hung his hands in fatigue. He collapsed against the wall and without William needing to tell him, two of the ranks kept his body reclined. William stepped into the middle of the trench and grabbed a rifle which had been discarded, most likely in the panic before. He checked the bullets and the clip, *click*, the sound echoed through the trench. William began walking along the trench, double-checking for any Germans movements outside of the gas. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a figure moving in the shadows. He assumed it was another soldier coming back from patrol, or at least he hoped it was. However, as he tilted his head, he could tell that it was no soldier. It was an enemy Magus, cloaked in black and wearing what appeared to be the latest in German Mage technology. Before he could shout a warning, the Magus threw a yellow aura over his hands, and a grenade landed in the middle of the trench.
'Down! Down!' A voice yelled and the soldiers hastily laid on the ground. The Mage, again, threw his hands up in shock and the yellow aura illuminated the entire trench with a blinding light. William watched the explosion and his ears filled with the deafening scream of the grenade. He saw dirt and mud fly over the trenches, felt the ground shake beneath him, and started wondering if he would die this way or survive to fight another day. He knew the answer was neither.  Instead, the dirt stopped flying and the mud dissipated to reveal a group of German soldiers, standing atop the trench. Shouts and curses filled the air as William saw the Germans' hands grabbed the grenades off their belts. They started to slowly make their way down the side of the trench, rifles in hand and pointing straight at William and the Platoon.
William heard a groan and saw a soldier on the bottom corner of the trench. He was about to step down to help when he saw the Mage kneel down next to the soldier and start to chant something inaudible. He threw his hands out and pushed a yellow aura directly over the soldier, healing wounds that William wasn't sure existed. The soldier got to his feet, thanked the Mage and then re-joined the platoon at the top of the trench. William tossed the dead soldier, he now remembered his name was Andrew, over the edge and then looked at the Magus.
'Are you okay?' William asked as he moved closer to the Magus. He patted his shoulder and back, looking for any wounds before the Magus grabbed his arm. 'Get the Platoon ready, Sir.' His voice was shook and his face drained. William looked around and saw the bodies of two other fallen soldiers. Two of his own men.
William heard another shell coming. He ducked and closed his eyes. 'We have to keep the Mage safe, and buy him some time!' He yelled as he opened his eyes and rushed up onto the wall, ready to fire his rifle at the enemy. The rest of his platoon followed suit and soon the entire trench was filled with the smell of gunpowder and screams from falling soldiers.
The Magus looked up, his eyes scanning around in a mixture of confusion and terror. 'What?'
The Mage shook his head. 'No. I will not be able to protect everyone. My strength is failing.'
The Mage nodded and held out his hands. His aura glowed bright as he began to chant out something. William could smell the energy and the pieces came together in his head, the Mage was about to erect a dome shield around the trench, the same type of shielding he has seen in some of the King's Palaces back home. 'Do it,' William said and motioned for the Mage to get to work. He worked quickly, mumbling words in a language William did not understand but had heard about in day dreaming stories, and soon erecting a dome of yellow light. William watched in amazement as a thick barrier formed and gradually filled in the trench. He counted to three and then clapped his hands. 'Shield erected.'
The Platoon stood up and grabbed their rifles with haste. Bullets flew off from the walls and sandbag bunkers that lined the sides of the trench. A few Germans climbed over the top and started firing rapidly, which caused a panic in the Platoon. William helped the Mage up and stood in front of him. 'Hold the line!' He shouted to the soldiers as he stood and loaded his rifle. He fired off a few shots, taking down a German as he heard another yell out in German, 'Gut Punch!'.
The spoke in their own language and William wondered what they were shouting over the trench. He surmised it was similar to what he would have been shouting. They needed a confirmed Magus kill. William reloaded his rifle carefully, as to make less noise, he knew they wouldn't get one today.
Suddenly, there was a loud explosion above the trench. William realized what it meant and knew that he had to act fast. 'Stop!' He shouted and all eyes turned to him. 'Magus prepare to retaliate.'
'Go.' William yelled and took aim. The marksmen in the platoon opened fire and the Germans stopped in their tracks. The sudden hail of bullets took them by surprise and the Magus looked up from his trance. He barely had time to get his hands up before the bullets started shooting around him. He dropped to the bottom of the trench and the Germans, while stunned and confused, slowly retreated.

The Magus sprung into action and pulled forth another vial, this time a blue one. He threw the vial into the middle of the German's group and, as soon as the vial touched the ground, a wall of bright, blue flames erupted. For a moment, shells of armor, bullets, and screams of terror filled the air. Then the flames began to eat away at the bodies and steps of the German's, pushing and then calving them away from the King's army and into the waiting arms of the enemy Magus.  The German, now surrounded with destruction, ushered his own Magus forward. William had never seen armor like it in the British Army. It's color was darker than the night sky, distinguishable from the regular brown Army coats. The Magus himself wore a hooded cape with a red interior. William knew it only meant one thing, he was an enemy Magus.
The King's Magus stood tall and proud, protecting his platoon with fierce loyalty despite the overwhelming odds. He threw his hands over his head, called out an incantation, and a yellow aura started to slowly fill the trench.
The air blackened in front of them as two different auras clashed together. It came out in a wave as sparks lit up around them and blinding yellow and red light encompassed the skies around them. The German troops opened fire, but almost instantly their bullets disappeared into the chaotic field of magickal power. William grabbed whatever cover he could and closed his eyes as the ground vibrated beneath him.
William felt himself fly back, a burning sensation gripping his body and tossing him in the air. He heard the cries of his comrades and the shouts of the Germans, but his universe felt like it was spinning back in time. He lifted his rifle mid-fall and fired off some blind shots, hearing the cries of pain as his rounds found their targets. Then, he felt the sharp pain in his stomach and felt himself hit the ground face-first.
When he opened his eyes again, he found the two armies had stopped their battle. Both sides looked at the aftermath and gasped. The two Magus were both lying on the ground, their cloaks singed and their eyes staring deep into the sky.
He heard his own Magus, groaning and moaned something about the 'blast causing him to blackout'. William smiled and thought 'it was his aura that saved my life.'
He nodded to him and immediately jumped onto the transport. The transport growled and started to move away but before it left, it bowed slightly.
William felt his own aura tight against him, as if to form a shield between him and the enemy Magus. But it was all too late.  The last thing William saw was the enemy Magus raising his arm up and screaming. Then, a flash of light and everything went dark.
