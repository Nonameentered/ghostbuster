General Bolden made his way to the antechamber, as he had done twice before. He recalled with amusement how Presidents Bush and Obama simply laughed at him before carrying on with the briefing, just as his predecessors recalled tales of 'The Revelation' dating all the way back to the Johnson administration. It began as a dare, something two drunken scientists made in a Houston bar back in the days of the Mercury program. If either of them made it to the office of the Administrator, they would assemble some official-looking presentation and bring it in for the President's in-brief. Something in private, very secret, plenty of pomp and circumstance for what would really just be an icebreaker at the beginning of a long and boring meeting.
The astronauts and scientists believed it would be what everyone expected it to be, just some military mumbo-jumbo about the possibility of the Americans being placed under extraterrestrial control. Talks of increasing the emphasis on planetary defense and a few charts and figures to back it up. They took it so seriously, they even gave it a name: 'The Revelation'.
It was quickly established as a tradition among successive Administrators and their Presidents as a way to start off the difficult and sometimes contentious briefings. A reminder that everyone was of a similar mind when it came to the great endeavours of NASA, and to remember a moment that was utterly unique in the history of the Agency.
Even with the years of tradition behind it, it was still a nervous time for the Administrator. To be found out was to risk dismissal or worse, risk losing funding for NASA. Still, there were certain things that just had to be done. Certain rituals to be observed, for old time's sake.
General Bolden nervously cleared his throat as he said those words his predecessors had said so many times before: 'Mr. President, could we please speak in private?'
