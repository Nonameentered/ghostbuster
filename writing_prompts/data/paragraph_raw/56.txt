It was a Monday morning when I woke up, groggy from a short sleep. The sky was still dark and all was quiet, so it came to my surprise that my dad was awake in a sort of silent trance, his eyes bloodshot and full of rage.
'I can't believe this,' he said, 'this whole country has gone to shit!'
'Morning, dad.' I replied. The TV had its sound muted but what he was angry at was quite obvious. It was on the news channel and the headline *ZUAFFYUL X-2739 ELECTED AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES* I was wholly indifferent to politics, I had no opinion on the matter.
'Do you understand what this means, son?' His voice sounded genuinely scared, which I felt was an overreaction. 'We've got to leave the country. This is the first step in a slippery slope. Eventually he's going to announce the genocide of humans to massive applause. And we voted for him! Ha!'
He shook his head in disbelief and started to go on a tirade about our corrupt government and the flaws in the election process.  The election of Zuaffyul X-2739 made me ecstatic however, I knew what type of reaction my dad would have so I kept my excitement in check, but I couldn't help but sending out a text to my friend.
'You've heard? History is made today! Our kind is now finally represented in the highest of offices! Feels like a dream come true, congratulate me!'
Z was my best friend at school. The fact that today, for the first time ever, one of his kind was elected president made me extremely happy. I made sure to hide this happiness from my father the rest of the morning before heading to school.
