The Council of Elders had gathered, as was tradition. A dozen or so familiar faces — Zorxx the Great, High Priest of the Poinsai Beta star system; Derns the Fierce, Intergalactic Warlord of Epsilon 9; and Sol, Elder of a system so distant, it remains nameless — among others. The ceremony was to begin shortly.
As follows in the ancient scriptures of the starcreatures from Old Atlas Sigma 6, the Lottery was to be pulled on this date.
Nature has a funny way. It has a strange tendency to refresh and replenish itself. From death, comes life; from extinction, comes evolution.
On this night, a curious twist of fate had occurred, as had happened throughout the councils. Earth, the third planet from the Sun was chosen.
It would seem fate had a fondness for Earth, the tiny blue marble becoming a commodity among the Council.
The chosen one, the planet that would receive the blessings of the Council, never was the same. Sundered Seas, scattered continents, broken moons and desolate lands. These were the fates awaiting each designated planet.
The ceremonial feast had been prepared and the horns sounded. The Council began the chant.
'Civilizations crumble,
People cry,
Many will suffer,
But one will be blessed, To carry on the verse.
Life is a blessing,
But also a curse,
But who can be certain
Who knows which is worse?'
The Prophet began its process. It said nothing. Silence fell upon the ceremony chamber. Faces grew grim.
At the rise of the New Sun, the fleets would be dispatched, and planets would become the ashes from which civilizations are born. One planet was chosen to grow.
It wasn't Earth.
