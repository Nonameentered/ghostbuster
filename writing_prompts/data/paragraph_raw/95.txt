Gary settled himself into his office chair and logged into the prayer inbox. He sighed with an air of trepidation as he opened the spam folder, ready to sort the few genuine prayers out from the mindless drivel that had somehow made its way in. He'd been asking God for a better spam filter for years, but apparently (Gary rolled his eyes) His Lord Almighty had other, more pressing issues to deal with.
Gary clicked impatiently through the junk mail.
*Get rich quick with this easy, foolproof plan!*
Delete. *Gain spirituality through this exclusive Miraculous Mart spiritual cleansing!* Delete.
*Do you need the ultimate solution to unlikkle problems? HALOBR OS offers the perfect answer!*
Delete.
*Win the jackpot of life! Best prayers are answered here!*
Delete (with many raised eyebrows).
Moving onto the main inbox, Gary settled in for a long day's work. He cracked his knuckles, staring at the extensive list of mail, and took a gulp from the polystyrene cup of vending machine coffee that sat next to his keyboard. Slowly, methodically, he began to work his way through the list of prayers.
Cathy, 29, who had prayed for the strength to finish a presentation for her boss, found herself imbued with a new sense of purpose as she discovered her most attractive colleague would be sitting in on the meeting. Meanwhile, Logan, 58, was granted the morning off work to watch his kid's school play, and Alfred, 84, stumbled upon his lost pen behind the sofa.
Of course, there were harder prayers too, ones Gary had to spend a little longer mapping out. He couldn't save the dying partner of Lucy, 33, from leukaemia- it was simply his time to go- but he could give him an extra moment of lucidity, and the strength to grab Lucy's hand and tell her how much he loved her. And when Andrew, 17, begged him to stop his best friend from considering suicide, Gary couldn't change the thoughts in the head of someone who hadn't prayed to him directly, but he could lift the cloud of panic from Andrew's vision just enough to let him support his friend and look for other sources of help himself.
Gary knew, as much as he enjoyed solving people's problems, that the real joy came in knowing he was working in God's service. Some days, Gary felt he was simply a middleman, channelling and relaying prayers to God, but at those times when he stumbled across a particularly desperate plea, he was reminded of why it was he was here- why he had taken this job in the first place. After dealing with the prayers of everyone from misguided teenagers to overworked mothers, Gary finally paused on a prayer from Leo, 19, who wanted to know why God was making him suffer, when all he wanted was a family and to be accepted and loved. Gary squinted at the tiny cursive as the words blurred in front of him. He leaned back in his chair, rotating his aching shoulder blades as he thought of the private pain his prayers were reflecting, day after day.
Gary treated himself to a hot chocolate at lunch, although it tasted bitter against the nausea that had risen in his throat on reading Leo's prayer.
The afternoon session was all pleas this time- Gary imagined the desire they must have given birth to in their hearts, the tiny spark that had brought their pleas to life, like wishes on a falling star. He didn't regret granting them; he liked feeling that he could help, but he was tired, and he tried not to let the heartache of human suffering swamp him too much.  Gary was just about to customise the most beautiful sunset any of them had ever seen when, with a flash, his computer screen filled with an error message. He had been logged out of the account, and no matter how he pressed the keyboard, no matter how he pleaded with the screen, he couldn't seem to get back onto the prayer inbox.
Gary pulled at his hair in frustration. He'd had enough of his Lord's personal interference today, thank you very much. What did you expect from a man who talked to his computer? There was a tapping at his door. Gary turned, and found an angel standing there, a look of concern spreading across his face. 'Yes?' mumbled Gary, with more than a hint of dread.
The angel tapped a few keys, opening up programmes that, frankly, Gary didn't even know existed, before he announced, smiling, 'Looks like you've got yourself a virus'.
'What?'
'A computer virus. Opened any odd attachments recently? Emails from unknown senders?'
Gary shook his head, 'No, I...' He trailed off as he suddenly remembered the email he'd opened that morning before he'd gone to pray. One that claimed to be from the 'Creator of Heaven and Earth'. He should have recognised it as spam, but at the time he'd been far too busy getting the prayer answers ready to pay it any attention. Now it seemed that the email had been hiding a dangerous secret.
'Well this isn't one I've seen before, I'm going to have to get my supervisor in here to sort it out.' The angel beamed. 'She's pretty booked up, but I can probably slot you in around Thursday.'
'Thursday's not gon na cut it!'
'Don't worry,' the angel said airily, 'if you're willing to wait I'm sure I can get you something earlier.' 'Don't worry?' Gary spluttered with anger. 'Don't goddamn worry?'
Gary kicked the side of his desk, hard, and instantly regretted it as pain shot through his foot. Hopping up and down, he cursed again, before letting himself flop into his chair. He glared at the error message, still shining out from the computer screen. He couldn't answer any prayers. It would take time for things to get better for Leo, and if the boy had to resort to prayer again, Gary wouldn't even be able to read it. It would go unheeded and unanswered.
And then Gary had a thought. Something about this virus seemed suspicious. His job description didn't include opening dodgy emails- it included sorting through all of the prayers addressed to him, good and bad. The purpose of the virus seemed to be disrupting this task. Which meant someone was purposely trying to stop him from receiving prayers.
Actually, that was a point. Who was capable of sending him a virus? An uneasy feeling began to coil in the pit of Gary's stomach. Most humans didn't even have the capacity to pray consciously- their thoughts were simply translated automatically into mail form. To understand the system, to send a virus, you'd have to be a supernatural being, something from heaven- or hell.
And why break the prayer operating system at all, unless you had a reason you didn't want them answered- unless you wanted the people of Earth to have to fend for themselves?
Uneasy, Gary clicked cautiously into the inbox to read the latest email. The sender was names 'God Almighty'. Gary's eyebrows rose. He hadn't heard from Him in several centuries.  He opened to the mail, feeling a heavy weight settle on his heart as he read.  'Gary, My inbox is full. I haven't been able to read any of the prayers coming from Earth for the past week. Someone has sent a virus to your computer system and it's completely blocked out any of the emails sent in. I'm currently unable to take action, and I'm afraid the virus will be here for the foreseeable future.  I'm sorry.  God Almighty.'  Gary slumped back in his chair, his stomach flip-flopping. It was hardly a surprise- those up in Heaven always had bigger priorities, and their main concern was to ensure that individuals and their communities were finding their own solutions to problems as opposed to relying upon divine intervention. It was a noble mission, Gary had to admit, but the feelings of helplessness and worry that it brought weren't ones he enjoyed.  Gary looked up at the door of his office, and before he'd even formed a thought in his head he was on his feet and striding across the room. Reaching the corridor, he skidded to a stop and rounded on the angel guards at the end.
“ Where is he? ” he demanded.
“ Have you made an appointment? ”
“ No! This is an emergency! ”
Gary could feel a vein popping out of his neck. He was on the verge of leaping over the desk and breaking into God ’ s office himself, when a holy, eternal aura seemed to descend over the room.
“ Gary. ” God's voice was calm. “ What seems to be the problem. ”
Gary was out of breath, and he could feel sweat beading on his skin. “ I need your advice. ”
