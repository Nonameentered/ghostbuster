I haven't been in my best times in the past few days. All I know is I killed a man, in cold blood, with another person identifying himself as my partner and finally congratulating me on a job well done.
Had I known what I was I would have responded with a standard response a cold blooded killer might have given a comrade, which is I do not know. The instant I saw blood on myself I grew into a panic, breathing slowly, heavily, realizing what I have done, and having this man beside me congratulating me about it. it was very unsettling. wait, unsettling is downplaying it. IT WAS REALLY FUCKING TERRIFYING. I was so confused I ran to the nearest opening I can think of in the crowds staining blood on the people around me as I shrug to run to whatever sanctuary I can find.
I finally settled in a barren alley, trying to figure out what I have done. first of all I tried to remember the scene but it was too much of a strain even for me, I can't remember anything at all, as to why I did it, I don't know, as to who was with me, he told me that he was an ally or something, as to where I am, I don't know.'Why has this happened to me' was all I can think of at that moment.
With fear crippling me, I decided to try to sneak my way out only to find out I was being followed by the local law enforcement. In a panic I switched my outfit with a random person and ditched my coat with blood. The thought of being caught made me go on a spree for the next few days, believing they are trailing me while hiding and living on the streets with no home or purpose. Was I making any sense while trying to escape?  No.
Laying in bed, resting from the nightmare of a day I have had, I try to think for clues, I thought'the knife back at the scene would surely tip me off','why can't I remember my partner in this incident, who was he?','why was I there?','what was my motive?'
Everyone I ask remembers me as a friendly person so what drove me to commit this act? I guess this is the part I will never get to know, until if I ever find out the truth.  It is then that the morning comes and I settle off the bed, heading out and scavenging some clothes and items to make up for the sweater I was wearing which is now stained with blood. the nightmare was still within me as I try to blend in wearing the same face as everybody else, but I could only feel myself becoming more and more paranoid.
With my makeshift coat and new garments I shift along returning to the scene of the crime, to find it riddled with sirens, and people of authority. as I try to walk along observing slowly, I overheard'must have been a hard life'I mean how can a man murder someone who can't even remember himself, a man with amnesia'And a young man himself!'. I was suddenly taken aback, all I could think was to despair in the form of regret, knowing my victim's innocence, and how could I have, with my hands, killed such a man.
I felt guilty, I was trying to think of alibis, I started to panic once more, and I felt that everyone was there to gang up against me, I felt small in the world at that moment, all I could think of was run. but that might put me into more attention than I am currently needing. what do I do.... what do I do...
It was as I held my head, looking at the ground and trying to think, that I noticed a wallet at my feet. It had some money, but most importantly a name. it was the man I killed. His name was William Miller. At this moment I felt powerless, all wanted to do was go home, take a shower, and never think of this day. But I had a responsibility, a responsibility to learn of what I did and how I could prevent it from happening again.  I tucked the wallet in my pocket and took a deep breath. For now I knew my purpose and it was time to face it head on.
I finally arrived at a room being escorted by the captor, who was revealed to be my partner from the crime. He was a man older than me, scrawny looking, yet his face seemed to hold experience I could see. He gave me a fond welcome asking if I was alright. I gave him a blank, confused expression, as I try to process the current situation. He told me that he was the one who planned the hit, and had gotten me involved with it. He gave me an explanation, and a reminder that even though I cannot remember, I still am part of this crime.  He then told me a good tip, he told me to find identities of my victims, so that I can find out of their family and the crime more deeply. That way it'd be easier for us to keep proceeding for our plans and with that I finally understood why him and I didn't part ways. He accept me as part of this now, as he explained that we were partners, growing with each other, and through this knowledge, I felt safer here.  It was here when I embraced my name as Frank Baker, my alias for this lifestyle, and found a life I could accept. Vowing to never again commit a crime, I desired to never forget this situation ever again, but rather understand how insecurities and bad decisions can bring the worst of crimes. No matter how many lives I touched, I know I must not do this again, and understand the truth of what its like to be a criminal.
