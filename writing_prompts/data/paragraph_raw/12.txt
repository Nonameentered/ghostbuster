'Disengaging from primary module. Do you copy?'
'Scanning for primary initiate. Copy.'
'Separation complete.'
'Looks good. Ready when you are, Commander.'
'Roger that. Engaging thrusters.'
Gazing upon the comet, Commander Harrison felt consumed by his awareness of its gravitational pull as he had for many months in this mission. Everything had centered around this grand celestial meeting. Now finally up close, the comet looked more lovely than he had imagined. The pull was so much stronger now, defying his most basic fears. Those deadly gaseous streams whirled off the comet's surface, in a dance both beautiful and terrifying.
Harrison reignited the thrusters, pale flames licking the static darkness and blasting a swirling vortex through the comet's dust-strewn tail. He rode the wave of the exhaust and felt the force of the engines digging deeper into his calloused hands as he controlled the craft. The comet's gravity surrounded him, pushing him ever closer and no matter how his expert hands moved, his course seemed inescapably fixed.
'Mission Control, this is Solo 1. Approaching the dark side of the comet. Visual is still strong.'  'Copy, Solo 1. Proceed at your own pace, Harrison.' The thrusters kicked in again and Harrison regained control. He felt the tug of the comet, dragging him toward his destination, but he kept a steady hand on the wheel. He edged forward, careful to respect the comet's atmosphere. Suddenly a river of dust swirled up blasting forward at high velocity, forcing him to take evasive action. Harrison slammed his throttle back and rammed the controls the other way. The change in direction was abrupt and uncomfortable, dragging him off course and nearly out of visual range.
'Sorry Mission Control. Holding back a little.'
'Passing 5,000 kilometers and still no visual.' 'Roger that, Solo 1. Keep looking.'
'Couldn't maintain a visual. Making course corrections now. Rendezvous to Comet Ellie is still on.'
'Copy, Solo 1. Keep it slow and steady. Remember the gravity.'
Harrison felt a wave of relief come over him as he snapped out of his stupor. He'd been so close to breaking off the mission that he had almost forgotten it. He neutralized the thrusters and nodded to himself. He had to remain focused.  It was time to change his tack. He crosschecked his systems one last time before he tilted his head to the side. His eyes gradually adjusted to the light streaming in from the comet's surface. He blinked slowly, and snapped on a pair of polarized goggles to help shield his eyes.  He shut off the thrust and the craft drifted towards the subsiding gas jets. He drifted closer, and closer still, searching for a calm pocket of air near the surface, his reaction times increasing with his anxiety. He heard Mission Control's voice in his earpiece, urging him on, but he was already more in tune with the comet than his controllers back home.
Toby's eyes adjusted to the new reality and the comet filled his vision, lit up by God's own spotlight. Its deep ruddy hue struck him with awe and wonderment, so alien and yet so familiar. He could feel his ship creaking, groaning in the uncomfortable proximity to a celestial body. But Toby had faith in its design. After all, it had brought him here to make history. He pushed his ship further, closing on the comet's dark side. The stars reappeared on the horizon and the temperature dropped, though his instruments registered denser air than expected. This could mean catastrophic failure for his craft, but Toby remained focused and pushed onward. He felt the ship shivering between himself and the comet, and he embraced the sensation wholly, allowing the fear to wash away as he maneuvered closer.
And then he was through. The comet's rocky surface loomed large before him and it was glorious in its perfection. He slammed the attitudinal controls, setting the landing sequence a little aggressively in his haste to join the surface. Outside he could see a chunk of hailstone shoot up past his window, and emerge into the broad sunlight where it condensed into a single clear teardrop. He turned away, his attention back on the surface.
The boardroom was deathly silent. Commander Toby Harrison stood towering over the desk with a single printout in his hands. He looked at her with that familiar intensity, an admiration that had endured for years. With a strength he'd rarely revealed in such public settings, he placed the printout on the desk and spoke.  'That, ladies and gentlemen, is where I landed. Ellie, after the longest 12 months of my life.' His voice only slightly softened as he continued. 'My gift to you is the first footprint on a comet, made by yours truly.'  The room erupted in applause and Toby released a deep breath. Finally, the mission had been a success.
The teardrop coursed its way down her cheek. Ellie Harrison didn't dare look Toby in the eye for fear of breaking the moment. Her 8-year old son held her in an embrace that was surprisingly strong. Standing across the room, Toby's father looked as stunned as she felt. She could read the elation in David's face, and a reflection of her own longing for this very moment. Closing her eyes to the torrent of feelings that overwhelmed her, she managed to hold perfectly still. Her son was hugging her for the very first time. That was enough.
