-Week 18 aboard the Depth Reaver, Circa 2023-
I find myself looking out the window of my quarters on the Depth Reaver, a space exploration vessel.  The stars stretch out endlessly before me, a reminder of the grandeur of space. It's a sight that never fails to captivate me and leave me in awe no matter how many times I witness it.  But, this time, I cannot help but feel a strange sense of restlessness. Space exploration is all very well and good, but it can be quite lonely, and often times it can be quite boring.
I arrive at the bridge, the hub of the vessel: the place where it's always humming with activity. It's a bit quieter than usual today, however. A lone figure stands at the window, looking out at the stars. It's my shipmate, Dale Malkowitz. He's an old-timer, been on this vessel since before I got here. He's always been kind to me, despite the fact that he's orders of magnitude more experienced in spacefare.
'Evening, Dale,' I say.
'What up, Danny?' he replies cordially.
'Nothin' much. A little bored, I guess.'
Dale raises an eyebrow. 'You're bored when you're *in space* ?'
I shrug. 'It gets old after a while, ya know? Plus, there's not much to do in the same place for over a year.'
Dale tut-tuts me and rolls his eyes, but doesn't say anything. We continue on our way together in silence for a while, until we reach the end of the hall and get to the observation deck.
I glance around. Dale Malkowitz is busy tinkering with some machine. There's no one else here. He's the only other person in this part of the ship, and I'm kinda hesitant to disturb him. However, the strange formation of the moon's surface seems too weird for me not to mention it. So, I walk up to him. 'Dale,' I say, 'Come look at this.'
He turns around, giving me a questioning look.
I point at the moon. His brow furrows. 'Huh... I guess there's something up with the surface. I'll have to look into tha-'
That's when it happens. BANG.  There's a sudden sound, like something is hitting the moon's surface. We both jump in surprise.
'What's going on?' I ask, alarmed.
Before he can say anything, another crack appears, and then another. We both gape. 'What the--' I say as I reach for my communicator. 'This is Danny Wittell from the Depth Reaver. We have an emergency here. Something strange is happening to the moon's surface.' 'd Copy that,' comes the reply from the other end. A few seconds later, we hear a thumping of running feet as the other crewmates flock to the window.
The other crewmates enter, unsure of what to expect. As their eyes lay upon the moon's surface cracks, they widen.
'W-w-what is it?' Janice stammers. 'It's like... like it's alive!' Malkowitz quickly regains his composure. 'I'm not sure yet, but I'm going to find out.' He turns to the others in the room. 'We need to be ready. This could mean serious trouble. And not just for us.' With that, he heads quickly towards the bridge, the rest of the crew right behind him.  We soon arrive at the bridge. The atmosphere is tense. We all take our places, plugging in to run diagnostics on the moon's surface. We wait with baited breath for the results. They come in quickly. 'The surface is being filled with excess energy,' Johnny reports. 'Whatever's causing it, it's doing so incredibly quickly.' Malkowitz nods. 'Increase shields for the ship and reverse the gravity fields surrounding us,' he orders, 'We don't want to get sucked in to whatever this is.' We all rush to do as he orders. The ship begins to shudder as it diverts energy to its shields. We all grip onto our workstations, prepared for whatever comes next.
Little bits of the moon begin to float away, torn free of the rest of the surface. We all stare, speechless. And then... it happens. It *happens*.
The side of the moon facing us is... torn away by a...
Human... hand?
A giant, *giant* human hand. And then, a head emerges. It's huge. We all move back in shock and awe. Then, the head turns to us.
A giant... human face?!
It's at least fifty feet wide, and its features are beyond human. Its eyes are golden, its hair is silver. Its skin is glowing, and it radiates an aura of power. We all watch, transfixed and shocked, as this giant face looks down upon us.  No one speaks. No one moves.  And then...  It looks up.  Its eyes stare at the stars beyond, and something else beyond that. Something far more powerful...
*Internet.*
The giant face seems to look right at us, and speaks.
'Prepare to be reunited, soldiers of Earth.' John Malkowitz nodded. 'I think it's time for us to go home.'
'Are you sure about that?'
