'I've gotten myself into quite a pickle,' my client told me, 'So I'm trying to get rid of some loose ends.'
It sounded like standard business to me. I was hired often to "tidy up" some of my client's messes. Usually it included informants snooping around or a bribing official. This one sounded like a perfect example of that. It was a simple request, or at least it seemed like one.
He gave me all the precise details. The person I was to take out, the address. Everything. I was intrigued by the task but I kept my cool. I asked him a few questions. Name, motive, anything to help me out. He simply shrugged, 'It's a job that needs doing. That's all I can say.' That was all I was going to get.
I went to the address disclosed for me. I found myself standing in front of small house, the wooden shutters decaying from time. The stairs on the porch looked like they were about to crumble if I coughed on them. For all I cared, the house could have been a pile of rocks, as long as I still got paid.
Before I could knock, a man stepped out of the shadows and beckoned me to follow him. I followed his wary steps until he opened a door leading to a long hallway.
We went deeper and deeper into the house until we reached the basement. We were greeted by a pleasant wave of musty air and the smell of fixer-upper projects. Halfway projects, pieces of furniture stacked high in corners, and a real sense of desperation.
The basement was cold, damp, and I could feel an excitement in the air. A figure was oddly seated in a folding chair. He was bound by rope to the metal structure bound to the seat, he wasn't going anywhere. And then stood another figure.
'Hi,' the'him' standing up said, 'I'm sure you have a lot of questions.'
I did, but that was unprofessional. I shook my head in response. I just wanted to get this weird shit over with. 'Good,' he said, 'I need you to kill me. THIS me!' He quickly corrected.
He continued, 'Yeah, I'm sure you recognize me. I just pulled off a heist. I needed to be in two places at once, so I made a clone.'
I only thought how.
'It's actually a pretty simple process. I managed to splice my cell's DNA and it grew in a lab. Now, I only need you to finish it off,' he said, gesturing to his clone.
I looked at the man, then back at the clone, then back at my client. 'You realize how insane this is?' I asked.
'Look man I'm a bank robber, but not a murderer. Plus he looks just like me! Think you'd be able to do the same? Just do the job and I'll pay you, dude.'
I looked at the clone sitting in the chair, tied up. He looked at me with tired, red eyes. His sorrowful expression. 'Don't do it man,' he said, 'He's lying. I remember everything in my life. I'm an actual person. *He's* the clone! Have some god damn morals!'
The 'me' interrupted, 'Shut up! Shut the fuck up, you imbecile. Just do the job!' He screamed.
I glanced at the two of them. My client and his self-made copy. In that moment, I could see right through them. He wanted to tie up all of his loose ends, see no one point to him. But at the same time, his clone was his brother, existing with life and emotion and memories of being alive. The idea of a person being able to create themselves, or a version of themselves, fascinated me, but I still had a job to do. I pointed the gun at the clone.
The two started yelling back and forth. At me. At each other. I zoned out, closed my eyes. I blocked them out and drew my gun.
-- -- --
I opened my eyes and emptied the gun in the clone's direction, watching the body slump against the ropes secured against the chair. The client, my now numbed old buddy, was enough stunned he barely moved. His mouth gaped open in terror and amazement.  '...Why?' He asked.  I put my gun away and stared him in the eyes. '  Because you had me do the job.' I stated.  And without another exchange, I left. I drove out of there feeling heavier than I ever have. I knew what I did was wrong, but I had no choice. I had a job to do and I did it. That's all there is to it.  -- -- --
I parked my new car at my new house. I still had some junk money left over. It would take a while for the rest to be laundered, but it would last me the rest of my life if I was smart about it. All my loose ends were tied and I covered my tracks. Some other poor bastard would be getting arested for what I did. After all, the event was just a job, and I still got paid in the end.
