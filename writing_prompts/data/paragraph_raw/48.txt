'Weren't you suppose to take that blow?'
I looked up to see a woman, hooded and cloaked, standing beside Emperor Kane. Her weapon pointed and ready. The light from the room's chandeliers glittered off of the metal. I had never seen someone take a stance such as her to a man such as Kane before. It was captivating.  My attention was taken away from the woman, however, as Kane's elite guard turned on him, guns pointed straight at his chest. It seemed like my action had little effect.
"I'm sorry, what?" I asked, confused.
'So you know of me?' I couldn't help but respond. I looked at the trio of misfits who had accompanied this women into the Emperor's suite. Two hulking brothers who had the IQ of a toad and some gangly archer had subdued the half dozen guards and two other councilmen who had been staying with the Emperor.
She merely smiled. 'My dear man, my name is Zelda Winchester, and I was sent to liberate Kane. I know of you, and everyone else hiding in this city plotting how to keep the throne.'
I let out a sigh. 'Of course.' I finally recognized her dark green hair, with a natural shading that I had only seen once before. 'You must be the daughter of that Planter fellow. The one who stabbed the emperor as Prince Arn since he had a forest razed. I'm guessing this is your revenge?' I was only talking to avoid getting killed. This event had occured twenty years before, early in my infiltration into the Empire when the old emperor ruled
'My father was not some fellow! He was a protector of the forest, a title handed down since the true rulers of Scoren reigned, the Winchesters! A forest your emperor destroyed for no good reason! One of them many evil things you helped him do. You have served this empire for decades, and have stayed quiet as he ended thousands. Why shouldn't I kill you as you stand?' The heroine began to point her sword in a far more threatening manner.
'Did you forget about Wallace and Monroe? Or the Emperor's youngest brother Stallone? You have done nothing except ruin the end of the Empire.' I began to work into my rant, but I was cut off.
'Ruin the end? I know what he was doing here. He was going to kill the Lamons ambassador and declare war on them for the resources of the Western Sea. And it would have been either fight for the Emperor or die!'
'It was going to be a coup that ended the Kane empire you fools!' I realized the eyes of the allies to the hero in the room were on me, and that all others were dead. I was the last to enter this room with the former emperor to live. I was going to make the mercy count.
'No, you fools! Sly Kane is the one who will be ending the Empire. It has been his goal this entire time, and while the emperor planned a pointless war he was biding his time. Tomorrow he would have arrived with the Lamons mercenaries and they would have taken the throne.'
The four of them couldn't help but shake their heads. The archer pointed his bow in the direction of Allen, one of the dead councilmen. 'No, we only got from spying on him the plot to kill him.' He seemed the too honest type.
'It is Sly Kane.'
'Impossible! He was executed last year for defying the emperor! He had no remorse for his nephew.'
'But I did, and forced another prisoner to take his place. And I sent him to Lamons, where he gathered the trust of the royalty and we continued our plot to end the Empire. So tomorrow, while the Emperor comes with 30 men and his close advisors, Lamons had brought 300. It would have been a bloodbath that ended everyone relevant to the Empire. And as the highest ranking heir. Sly would have taken the throne and converted power into a parliament, much like Lamons is. But with the Emperor dead, those men I spoke of earlier will run and know something is up. The assault on Lamons will occur and many men and women will die to your overzealousness.'
They looked shaken as I told them this, as I explained to them their folly. Then one of the oafs spoke.
'But if we kill them, we still good?'
'Huh? You mean Wallace and Monroe and Stallone and the others that would have been there? They are spread in multiple locations, with many a guard. Arn was arrogant and thought he would not be attacked and brought among his weakest with him.'
'But Lamons has 300 men you said.' The oaf pointed a giant hole in my logic.
He was right. If we attacked now, this could be salvaged. 'Alright, but we must move fast. Stallone will be here shortly to speak with his brother, and he will alert the rest once he sees the dead. Sly is staying in a tavern not far from here, while Lamons decoy ambassador is three floors below. We must move quickly.' I began to look at the heroine who still was pointing her sword threateningly at me.
She looked around and sighed before putting her sword down. 'Fine, but I will help. I wish to meet this future leader, and to see if he is true or if he is using you to further his goals.'
I chuckled as I went to gather my cloack I needed for this excursion. 'I have been doing this for longer than you have been alive. Waiting for this day to end it all at once. If I thought Sly could betray me, I would have let him die.' I made sure it covered my face well enough and made my way to the door.
'Let us finish this.'
