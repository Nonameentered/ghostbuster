Finding good help around here is nearly impossible.
What? You think I'm asking for a pile of helpless newborns to knock off? That's a big NO from me. It's nothing but a silly rumor that's grown up around here, and it's a royal pain.  Let me put it this way: when I, Lucifer, took over this corner of hell, I inherited an enormous number of innocent little babes. I didn’t ask for them; no one did. But it has been my job to provide for them, as much as one can while residing in the depths of the afterlife.
No, good babysitters do not sacrifice babies and children. I know this from my own experience, caring for hundreds of infants and young children as a substitute parent.
The truth of the matter is, no, they don ’ t make good babysitters. I would never even think of asking someone to commit such an atrocity just to help me out with childcare duties. Ugh, it ’ s really quite repulsive.
Folks, please, do not believe the hype. It ’ s purely malicious gossip. I am not an evil baby killer. In fact, I ’ m quite the opposite. It ’ s me, your faithful Satan, tending to the babies all night long. Every night. Yes, that ’ s right. I don ’ t sleep.
I mean, how are non-evil people supposed to take me seriously when they keep hearing preposterous tales like, “ the Devil will slaughter children and drink their blood in order to gain strength. ” Do I look like the kind of guy who has the time to pull off something like that? Hell no.
Of course, rumor has it the baby sacrifice was invented by a handful of unscrupulous cults who thought it was a good way to scare people and gain a following. Big mistake. All it did was saddle me with 250,000 screaming children. Of course, you’ ll never hear about my volunteer work at the local orphanage or my commitment to bettering our planet for future generations, no, just the baby sacrifice slander.
“ Then the babies are killed? ”—that ’ s all anyone ever asks.
So, yeah, I take care of 250,000 infants, and I wish I got the credit I deserve for it. All I'm asking for is a little recognition every now and then. Hey, at least they didn ’ t have to be sacrificed, right? That should count for something.
So on behalf of all us down here, I implore you to stop spreading the rumor that I condone baby sacrifice. People need to understand that it isn ’ t part of our demonic mission, nor will it ever be.
For evil ’ s sake, I ’ m doing the best I can. If I ever come across as mean, cut me some slack. As a single father of 250,000, I think I'm entitled to being a little cranky once in a while.
