We were gentle, once. I don't remember it clearly anymore, but I can see it on the faces of those who knew me, and the others. Now, we are neither gentle nor hard. We are not benevolent, nor cruel. Not saviors, nor tyrants. Not children, nor grown. We simply are. We are simply'Candidates'.
The title should give you some glimpse into our past, as well as our future. Especially today, the day before our graduation and our selection. All but one of us will have failed... HAS already failed. So many decisions led us here, so many twists and turns, as humanity has forced us into a mold that perhaps none of us were meant for. Perhaps humanity was not meant to be led by a single person. Or perhaps we were chosen for this process in order to save the humanity of others at the cost of our own.
It was the 99th year, the one that marked the end of 'The Gods', of the ruling classes. Mankind had decided to end old rules, old hierarchies, but we were somehow still bound together by something. Maybe it was just the spirits of the old kings, or maybe something more- I'll never know. We had decided to create a fair future. Thus the Candidates were chosen, five of us from all different nations, creeds, genders. We were the prototype, the test run for the rest of humanity; torn from our homes, our families, our friends. In search of something better. In search of something greater.
I had worked hard. I had been born to a poor family of immigrants, who came to this country in search of a better life. We lived in a tiny apartment, barely enough room to move in. Worked in a factory, and barely made it by paycheck-to-paycheck. But I had worked hard- despite all the odds, despite all the obstacles, I had made it. I was no longer just a street urchin, but a Candidate, a potential leader of mankind.
The tests began soon after. Tests of strength and speed, of emotional stability and understanding. Tests of my humanity, and of my ability to lead. And tests of my loyalty. Where would I draw the line, between what was right and what was wrong? Could I give when it was most needed?  I remember the night of Janine, the night that would decide my fate. Janine was a young woman, the same age as me, and for weeks we had been hiding together. Hiding from the hunters, from the madrigal, from the chaos of our world. But Janine was sick, and we knew it. We knew her death was coming. And that is when they tested me. Would I self-sacrifice? They knew I could, but would I?
I won't be selected, and I know it. I know it because they don't test, they don't prod at me. I let Janine die, simply because to save her would have killed us both. They wanted self-sacrifice, but cold pragmatism stopped me. We were friends. In another life, maybe lovers, had we met. But I let her die anyways.
We were gentle, once. What are we now?
