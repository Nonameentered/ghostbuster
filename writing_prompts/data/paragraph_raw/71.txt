The pitter-patter of little feet across the metal grating across the living quarters punctuated the otherwise dull hum of computers and machinery which, in-turn, punctuated the maddeningly monotonous silence of deep space. Sarah sat reading her daily reports, preparing for another shift in sick-bay. Her daughter Megan tugged at the corner of her purple robe, smiling up at her mother with the most endearing green eyes. Innocence was trademark, innocence and the faith of her mother.
'Mom, can we go to the bridge, please! I promise I'll be quiet!' Megan said, her voice excited.
Sarah turned and smiled but shook her head. 'Next week.'
'You said that last week' Megan grumbled and turned to go back to her studies.
Hundreds of families across one hundred generations aboard one mammoth ship. A thousand years ago it was launched with the singularly simple goal of depositing a collection of humans on another planet to build a colony. Planet by planet, system by system the *H.S. Renewal* has visited a laundry list of exoplanets but each has been crossed off like items on a shopping list. One simple task had turned into the longest mission in mankind's fifty thousand year history. In fact the current generation of explorers could be called human in genetic makeup only. None had any first-hand knowledge of Earth or the Sol system as contact with Earth had been lost some two hundred years ago. It is unknown who fired the first shot but we do know it was the United States who committed to full-scale nuclear retaliation. Now the *Renewal* contains the only known surviving Homo sapiens. Survival the primary goal, education the primary means of attaining that goal. Survive, educate, populate; that is the motto of a faction of the refugees aboard that still believe their voyage ever had a mission. Another faction believe it as the last voyage of the damned, set off a thousand years ago by fools. Sarah styled herself a believer but James, her husband, fell firmly into that second category, known as *denialists*.
As Megan had since toddled away to her bedroom Sarah resumed her reports, straining to remember the complicated details of the propagation of nerve signals in zoological biology. Science had consumed her days since she was admitted to medical college. Engineering her husband's, but it was the rigorous classes she was taking at the college that had caused them to start discussing the moratorium on education. They had discussed it since arriving back at the *Renewal* five years ago but had yet to arrive at a resolution, each time their discussion would end in a heated argument that would quickly end in the only resolution either of them had ever agreed to take: sleep.  'Sarah!?' The voice spoke from the other side of the door. 'Yes honey?' She called back, the reports already starting to feel the effects of being put down for a few minutes. 'Are we doing medicine and engineering today?' Megan's voice was full of eagerness, she was just three weeks away from her college graduation.
Sarah giggled briefly, her eyes never leaving her reports. 'I just hope she passes.'
James laughed. 'Well you taught her to believe in simple probability and statistics. In her mind five-to-one is an optimistic best-case scenario.'
'He really doesn't believe does he?' Megan asked aloud from her bedroom door, referring to her mother and father's marriage difference.
'Well, maybe if you hadn't done that abacus project in your first term you...' 'Jim!' Sarah cut him off before he could go off on his usual rant against the (misleading) quality of the educational system on board the *Renewal*. He chuckled to himself and took a sip of his coffee, securing his mandible behind the cup with both hands.
Sarah shook her head and sighed. 'I know you don't believe but I do and I asked you to keep that denialist talk out of our quarters.'
'No, you asked me to keep it away from Megan. She's buried in her chemistry textbooks, I could scream out chocolate ice-cream and she wouldn't hear me. Besides, at this point nobody would know how to start a colony even if we did find a suitable planet. We stopped educating builders with your great-grandparents and we stopped educating architects with their grandparents!'
Sarah silenced him with a stern glance, her eyes finally lifting from her reports. 'I don't want to hear that talk.'
'Okay, okay, sorry baby' James sighed and composed himself again.
Sarah mumbled an acknowledgement and turned back to her work, all trace of a smile gone.
James took the hint and stood up with his coffee again. He straightened his uniform and stopped to kiss her on the top of the head before walking toward the main entrance to their quarters. He stopped one last at the threshold and turned half-way back to the dining table and his wife. 'We've got two mesoplanets and a thermoplanet to survey today, I'll let you know what we find.'
'Survey with a smile' Sarah called back without looking up, her own lips quivering in amusement.
James chuckled, 'yeah, right. See you tonight.' He blew a kiss back to Sarah then turned again and exited their quarters.
