'Floride!' I exclamed. That was the answer. It must have been suppressing the bacteria into a dormant stage all these years. Patient zero had bad hygiene, was pretty isolated far from civilization, but was around people when the we were all exposed to the bacteria. Though the early victims might have been through contact it was only once we lost running water that the number of infections exploded. I asked 'What are we going to do?'
Dr. Fredbotvonick smiled and said. 'We fluoridanate water in the river, then we fluoridate water in all river.'
He knew the technique was good but it would take a lot of money and manpower to monitor the process. But he was not going to let the public suffer. So he sent out a team of volunteers to the local river and with their help they managed to fluoridate the water, halting the spread of the deadly bacteria. Not only that, but they also organized health education and sanitation programs afterward that dramatically lowered the rate of disease in the area.
'Are you coming?' I asked
'I can not. This is your job. Your fate.' Fredbotvonick said, 'I need to rest.' I saw the stack of local anesthetic at his desk and immediately understood.
