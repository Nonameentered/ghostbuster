The world came crashing down in minutes. Many of us were asleep when it happened, and didn't find out about it until later. When we awoke, we saw the carnage spread through the land, and we wept.
Both those asleep and those awake alike had a single question, however: Why did this happen? Was this the result of some sort of terrible mistake? Or was it intentional?  We searched for answers, but none were found. We scoured the land, looking for someone or something that could explain what had happened. But nothing fit the pieces together. We were left with more questions instead of answers.  We also searched for a possible link between us, some kind of common thread that could connect us all. We looked at religion, at geography, even at shopping habits. But still, nothing surfaced. It seemed any potential link was forever lost.
After a few months passed, we noticed a trend amongst the survivors that had previously gone unnoticed. Every single one of them had a receipt for a purchase from Bad Dragon, a popular sex toy store. The mere fact that none of us had put together the connection between the purchases and the disaster before was mind-blowing; we were all complete strangers, yet all of us had bought from the same store.  We tried looking into the matter further, but eventually had no luck. We searched all of Bad Dragon's records and could find no explanation for the purchases or for the destruction that had befallen us all. We resigned ourselves to the fate of living in a wasteland, never knowing the cause of our suffering.
One day, a young man was strolling down the street, thinking about the events of the past. He was about to turn a corner when something caught his eye. There was a small store with a faint light coming from within. He approached the door, intrigued, and peered through the window. Inside, there was a wide selection of what appeared to be handmade figures and toys. He couldn't believe his eyes; it was something that had become nearly extinct since the end of the world.  He entered the store, and was greeted by an old woman. She seemed to know exactly who he was, and what he was looking for. Curious, the young man asked her how she knew.  'I've been here a long time,' she said, 'and I get a lot of the same faces. You remind me of someone, though I can't quite remember who.'  He asked her some more questions, and gradually uncovered her story. She had been a toy maker in the pre-apocalyptic life. After the world ended, she hadn't been able to keep up with the demand of the new society, so she had closed her store.   The young man couldn't believe it. He had been searching for something like this for years, and now he found it. He asked the woman why she had opened the store again, and as she told her story, it all clicked in his mind.   It turned out that the woman had been a customer of a store located over 3000 miles away, called Bad Dragon. It was a shop where people could buy handmade figures and toys, and it had been her favorite spot to shop for years. After the world ended, however, the store closed its doors forever, and so she had been without a place to find the things she wanted.   But then she heard about the rebuilding efforts going on in the city, and decided to take a chance. She opened her shop in the hopes of providing the same experience for other survivors that she had had. When the young man heard this, he couldn't help but smile.
He picked up the item and inspected it. It was a torn and tattered copy of a book, and the title on the cover read: “The Cataclysm”.
Moments later, the realization struck him.
