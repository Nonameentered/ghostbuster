He stood there, looking as his own grave.
A 4x4 plank of wood adorned with wilting flowers and a single chipped stone had been placed at the head of the lonesome hole, marking the passing of some forgotten person who had been laid to rest there. Not even their name was known.
The man, Francis, stared at it. His hands clenched and unclenched and his breathing quickened as he did so. He couldn't bring himself to look away, not even for a moment.
'Do it, Francis.' A voice sounded somewhere behind the troubled man, but he didn't turn around to acknowledge it. Yet for some reason, it continued to speak. 'You know why you're here. We all know why.'
Francis hung his head low, body trembling with the turmoil of his inner demons.
'We all know what's happened. We all know what you're responsible for.'
The man went still and said nothing in response. He slowly closed his eyes, as if trying to hide from the truth.
'You killed her, Francis. It was all your doing, and you can't run away from it.' The man still didn't turn to look. He could only pant, wondering where these words were coming from. The cemetery was silent, save for the faint cries of crows in the far off distance. It agitated Francis further as he attempted to locate the source of this voice.  But then, suddenly, he heard the distinct sound of quiet footfalls, and far off he could make out a shadowed figure shimmering in the mist. The figure began to take shape, female, and Francis noticed a cold glint in the woman's eyes as she made her way closer.
'What do you want from me?' Francis hissed through gritted teeth.
The man lowered his gaze, head bowed in shame. 'I didn't mean . . .' his voice diminished to a whisper.
'Lies.' The woman stepped forward, gesturing to the crowd behind her. 'You killed her, just like you killed the others.'
The woman stepped forward, her gaunt face sharply illuminated by the early winter sun. 'You know what you did. You know *why* you're here.'
'You didn't have to do it, Francis. She was kind, and you took her away from us. From me.'
Francis felt an icy chill run up his spine, as if an invisible hand was dragging him down to his knees. He felt powerless in the face of this accusation, and suddenly the man knew he was being pulled toward his own grave.
It was Jessica's.  The child that Francis had wronged - the child he was responsible for killing - stood at the edge of the grave, staring with a wounded gaze at her murderer.  'You did this,' She said finally, her voice both accusatory and desolate. 'You took away my life.'
"What have you done?!?" The girl's voice, barely above a whisper, shook Francis to his core. It was her. It was Jessica. He had killed her. The truth of his actions was inescapable. There was no denying it any longer.
Jessica slowly made her way towards the forlorn figure of her murderer. When she was at arm's length, she fixed Francs with her soulless gaze, which he found infinitely more damning than any incrimination of the crowd.
'I'm sorry,' Francis sobbed. He laid in the dirt, curled up in a fetal position. 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm *so*, *so sorry*.'
The man stayed there for a while. He had no grasp on the passing of time. When he finally raised his head, there was no girl, there was no crowd gathered at the edge of the grave, there was no woman with her sharp words.
Just him, his guilt, and his grave.
