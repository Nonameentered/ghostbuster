Tugtug was Declan's favorite toy. Daddy gave him Tugtug for his fourth birthday. Daddy liked boats too. He had his own Tugtug, but his was much bigger.
One day, daddy took mommy and Declan on a ride in his boat. Tugtug came along too. Tugtug went everywhere with Declan.
Tugtug loved the feel of the ocean splashing him. 'This must be what home feels like,' he thought. Tugtug wanted to stay on the ocean forever.
Declan was Tugtug's best friend. Tugtug didn't want to leave him behind. One night when daddy wasn't looking, Tugtug took Declan to the water and they went for a swim.
That night there was an awful storm. Tugtug and Declan were swept away. Daddy and mommy looked for a long time, but never found them.
In the morning Tugtug found himself on a beautiful beach. Declan was nowhere to be seen! Tugtug floated along next to the beach, looking for his friend.
Then one day, Declan was there! He was very happy to see Tugtug again. From that day on, they were never apart. Tugtug and Declan sailed the ocean together, exploring new places and discovering new adventures. They were best friends forever.
The End.
