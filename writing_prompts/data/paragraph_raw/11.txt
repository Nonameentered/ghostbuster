He sat back in the chair, looking at the monitors behind me. Four of them were mounted a foot below ceiling height, all screens showed employees working. I glimpsed out the window to see the rows of cubicles, all with short walls so that the owner of this CPA firm could watch the employees constantly.
He cleared his throat and I snapped my attention to him. 'So, how'd your interview go?'
I was there for an interview; I had been referred by a recruiter. The owner said he wanted someone who was 'efficient and reliable'. I had an idea what he meant since his desk had two chairs in front of it so he could 'interview' people directly. Instead of a normal desk, his was a bit raised, like a throne. He was looking for the perfect employee, one who he could control and manipulate.
He also said that he was going to give me a personality test and that this test had never been passed before. 'It's designed to find out if you'd fit in here,' he said, his eyes searching my face for the obedient subservience he was looking for.
I had a gut feeling I knew where this was going. 'What kind of test?'
'Oh, great!' he beamed. 'It's a personality test that was developed by an evangelical Christian organization. I'm sure you can answer the questions honestly and that'll give me a good sense of who you are.'
He leaned forward, eyes narrowing. 'Now, I've already given your recruiter instructions; you will answer honestly. I won't making an offer to someone who isn't a perfect fit.'
He handed me the test, told me it was timed, and watched me like a hawk while I filled in the little bubbles. I didn't answer honestly, as he'd insisted, but instead drew from my knowledge of what the religious group valued. Test complete, he smiled smugly and told me that he'd get it scored and let my recruiter know if he wanted to proceed.
One week passed and my recruiter, Bob, called and asked me to come in. When I got there, Bob said that the scores came back and I had passed!
I thanked him, but held off on an answer. I had a feeling that wasn't going to work. I called my recruiter and told him the situation. Bob, the recruiter, was quite surprised. 'But he said you passed the test.'
'But why?' Bob wailed.
'Look Bob, the guy is a control freak. He wants to control everything, including his employees. I don't think I want to work for someone like that.'
'Bob,' I said, 'tell the other people you sent him that they don't even need to take the test.'
'Tell them he wants blind obedience and they should taylor their answers to that. Tell them he's going to watch them constantly and probably counts the pens every night to make sure they don't steal any.'
'Oh,' Bob grunted. 'Sound like the job, if they got it, would really suck.'
I couldn't help but laughing. 'Sounds about right.'
It's three years later and Bob told me recently that he still has never found anyone who wanted to work for the guy.
