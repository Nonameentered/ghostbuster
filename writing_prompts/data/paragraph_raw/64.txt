'Don't forget to ask her.'
Bobby was a young man who wanted to find out more about his future. His grandmother heard of a local fortune teller who could answer specific questions. She told him to go and ask the fortune teller about the most important decision he would ever make and the date he would die.
Bobby's grandmother had always been a strong advocate of taking chances and not letting fear stand in the way of opportunity. So when she asked him to go to visit a fortune teller, Bobby was a bit apprehensive. He had never done anything like this before and was wondering why his grandmother thought it was a good idea. Still, after much thought, Bobby decided to take his grandmother's advice and went to visit the fortune teller.
Bobby decided to take a chance and make the appointment with the old fortune teller that his grandmother recommended. As he arrived he was surprised by the old Victorian house that the fortune teller owned. It had a warm and inviting energy and Bobby could feel the curiosity and excitement build in him when the door suddenly opened, revealing the kindly face of the fortune teller.
The fortune teller herself was quite a sight. She had long, curly dark hair that framed her beautiful face, a bejeweled scarf of many different strong-colored stones draped her neck, and an inviting smile to welcome any and all customers.
'So, what can I do for you today Bobby?' Asked the fortune teller, her voice almost as if she had been talking to people like him her entire life. Bobby cleared his throat, still a bit nervous, but he had a plan.
'I want to know the most important decision I will ever make and the date when I will die.' Bobby asked with a bit of trepidation.
Bobby noticed that the fortune teller's attitude towards him changed but for a second, and then back, 'Sure, Bobby, let's do look into those things.'
Bobby was getting more and more enthralled. He saw the fortune teller's confidence in his face and moved forward on his chair in curiosity. She continued, 'Before we start, I must tell you, Bobby, that I cannot tell you the date of your demise, but what I can do is (you can, however, show you a vision that will help you understand what is the most important decision you will ever make and how that decision will shape your life.'
The crystal ball started to hum. Bobby looked inside the ball, and started to see a vision. It was of an office, and there a man in a nice suit is writing on a size able desk with a brandy glass and a bottle of it in front of him. He looks up to the wall and looks at a portrait, and then back to the coding. He stands up, picks up his glass and takes a swig.
Bobby leaned in closer and couldn't believe his eyes. He could see himself in the crystal ball as if in a window, looking at a man sitting at an expensive mahogany desk in what he assumed was some kind of higher-level executive office. There sat a handsome looking man in a suit, mid-forties looking at an open folder, with papers covering his desk. There was a tumbler of something placed next to his his reading glasses, but he could not quite make out the label on the bottle.
In the glass, Bobby could see a man seated in a rather fancy little home office. It was pretty clear that it was him -- Bobby -- sitting there at the desk. On the desk, in front of him, was a small, but very ornate name-plate. It said 'Robert'.
Bobby was indeed mesmerized by the dialogue of the fortune teller. He had never been this close to a real fortune teller. He nodded his head in agreement, yes, he could indeed see the nameplate on the desk, and the brandy bottle on the credenza, and the man at the desk. The man was him! Bobby!
'I see you are in a rather large office. It looks to be part of a large corporate structure. I see you working on something at this large mahogany desk. There seems to be a folder open and I can make out figures and such on the papers that you have spread all around you.'
Robert grabbed his glasses from his desk and began to read the folder revelation was hidden in the safe. At the same time, the vision before Bobby's eyes shifted from the past to the future and Bobby saw Robert, still wearing glasses, twirling the dial of the safe in his hands as soon as he had opened the safe.
'What? What do you mean? What is it that I am sad about?' Bobby asked, anxiously. 'Oh, Bobby, you need to be patient,' whispered the fortune teller. 'I am seeing a safe with a combination lock. It is a safe that only you can unlock. This safe holds the answers to your very questions.'
'He turns the knob on the safe but it doesn't seem to open. He seems to be having some difficulty with the combination. He slowly turns the knob to the right, his face lightly damp and holding in his frustration, stopping for a moment, then to the left and placing the knob on the number 10, then back to the right....' The fortune teller pauses for a moment as if to take a great inhalation of air and continues.... 'But the knob does not open and we see a flurry of rapid movement on Roberts part. You can see the distress in his eyes. His forehead is becoming all wrinkled as he mentally tries to figure out the combination.'
'You are testing yourself Bobby. The combination to the safe is what will be the most important decision you will ever make, and the date written by the dial is the day you will die. To open the safe, you will need to open the combination.'
He then cranked the lever on the safe again and this time the safe opened. Robert pulled out a piece of paper. Bobby and the fortune teller went back in time and watched as Robert stared at the paper for the longest time. His eyes began to water again but this time he rubbed them dry with the back of his hands. He then read the paper and nodded his head somberly a few times. Bobby could swear he heard a brief whisper of 'My God.' from Robert's lips. Robert put the paper back into the safe and slowly shut the safe and cranked the lever., trying a different combination of turns if the digits this time.
The door to the safe opened with a click.
The room returned back to its normal level lighting, and the fortune teller added, 'That is what I see, Bobby. In regards to your two questions. The most important decision you ever make will be when you open the safe and read the documents within. The date of your death will follow shortly after you finish reading the documents.'
The fortune teller said, with a solemn, professional face, 'That is all I can tell you about your decision and when you will die. But I can tell you one more thing; that decision will determine your fate and your date of death.'
'Bobby, you saw the most important decision you will ever make. When you make that decision your life will be changed forever. As for the date of your death, I'm afraid I can not tell you that. That is yours to find out. Good luck, Bobby.'
The fortune teller looked directly at Bobby and said, 'It means that the most important decision you will ever make is a choice you have yet to make. It will involve a choice of a person or a thing.'  The fortune teller then leaned back in her chair and said, 'Now let us look further. The date of your death? That is something I cannot predict, but I can show you the nature of your life and how to live it so that when it comes, you will welcome it with open arms.'
