Bzzzzzzt. Bzzzzzzzzt. Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzt.
I was startled awake by an unfamiliar buzzing, a noise I had never heard before. I groggily looked around my room trying to solve the mystery. I had only a hazy recollection of where I was and what I was doing there. Where was I? Why was I here?
I looked around the room, it was different. The bed was smaller and the wallpaper had been replaced, what was more striking was the size of the computer in my room.
My door is open. But my parents ’ house is unfamiliar. I have bookcases on the wall, along with trinkets that once filled my childhood. I don’t recognise the wallpaper, or the old photos that line my walls. I have no idea what year it is. I can’t help but panic, I try to process what is going on before I reach into my pocket for my phone.
“ What the fuck. ” I said probably too loudly. I picked up the phone.
“ LANGUAGE! ” Came a shout from downstairs. I had been too loud.
I flipped the phone open, and I saw it light up. I don ’ t know how long I sat there, but it was long enough for my mother to walk past, and say she was leaving for work. It was only then I realised I was shorter. My back didn ’ t hurt. My mother left, and I sat there in silence. I looked at my desk, there was my old bulky CRT monitor. I looked at the TV, and it had a video player under it, and was also a CRT and took up most of the space in the cabinet at the end of my bed.
What? Was going? On? I stumbled out of bed and went for a shower. There was no mistaking it, I was young again. 14ish? I went started to get dressed, and quickly realised I didn ’ t have a shirt because I wasn ’ t a senior. I had a polo shirt. I wore it with some trousers that clearly needed replacing. I was still struggling to believe this was happening. I checked my phones date, it was August 1999.
I got myself some toast, struggling to reach the toaster. I put on some apricot jam I found in the cupboard as my step brother walked in “ Toast and Jam? You only eat peanut butter. ”
He sat down, I told him what had happened and we talked about what it would be like being in school again. I had a feeling I knew something about this girl, something which had to do with ‘ my future ’ but I couldn ’ t put my finger on it.
I grabbed my backpack, checked I had my main subjects books and left for school. As I left the area I saw a girl from the year above me I ’ d never had the courage to talk to.
“ You ’ re Sophie, right? ”
She turned around. “ Yeah. Mike is it? You ’ re Jane ’ s friend. So looking forward to the new school year? ” She asked in a far too happy sound.
“ Does anyone ever look forward to school? ” I replied with the cadence of a 29 year old insurance underwriter who ’ d seen many a terrible grey Monday morning. Today was nice though, sunny, and warm.
“ Ha ha. I know. So you go anywhere over the summer? ” She asked.
“ Sophie, I feel like I ’ ve been gone a lifetime. ”
