All of this should be such a joy, a wondrous time where people all around the world are brimming with love and excitement over what they might have been brought. But it ’ s not, I ’ m worried, I ’ m borderline panicked. Every single year, I ’ ve felt my anxiety grow as the temperature drops, all because of one question nagging me between the ears. Am I on the naughty list this year? And there ’ s no answer, there ’ s never an answer because we weren ’ t given a guideline, there ’ s no clear line drawn in the sand that we must not cross lest we end up on the naughty list. So we ’ re left to our own devices, trying to live our lives as best we can, but people slip, they always slip. There ’ s not a soul who doesn ’ t know someone who made it onto the naughty list, I ’ ve been to the funeral of three of them alone. I ’ ve hugged my crying brother-in-law after the small explosive took my sister ’ s life. And what ’ d she do? I don ’ t know, neither does he, all we can be certain of is that she made it onto the naughty list. And she was among some of the more fortunate.
Part of me is glad she got off that easy, we ’ ve all heard the classic tales, people appearing on the local news every Christmas day telling the harrowing tale how a gift mutilated them and showed them the error of their ways. But that ’ s all bullshit, you can see it in their eyes, it ’ s fear motivating them to tell their tales. There ’ s nothing they wouldn ’ t give to have back their hands, their eyes, their legs, they ’ d all happily be the same scumbags they were before their gift was dropped off.
Yet that doesn ’ t change anything, millions of people die every year because of this crap, and we ’ re supposed to rejoice? Spread holiday cheer around, and wish our neighbors a very merry Christmas even knowing that there ’ s a chance that their son or daughter was maybe a bit too mouthy in school this year, and will be added to the ever-so-mournful Christmas obituaries. You ’ d think the death toll would ’ ve gone down after the first few years, but it ’ s still growing. Every. Single. Year. There has been more, and the answer to the question which all news stations ask when the death toll gets released is; we ’ re inherently assholes. You, me, your grandparents, all of us. None of us are perfect, it is impossible for us to be. But we used to embrace this aspect! We used to consider our imperfections to be what made us beautiful! Now? We dot our I ’ s and cross our T ’ s, we don ’ t say a mean thing about anybody ever, even when they deserve, we never curse, we always look both ways before crossing the street. People used to think it was our government that would turn us this way, sterilize our culture, make us all become non-thinking robots, afraid to act outside the norm. But no, it was him.
We ’ ve all turned into dull drones, just waiting for the axe to fall. Christmas time, for the past seven years, has been a time of stress and agony for me. Every year, I ’ ve been teetering so close to the line that I ’ d almost felt like I ’ d get dragged away by the jolly old elf within minutes. Thought about biting my tongue, not taking that swing when the guy insulted my mother. Thought about not talking back to the teacher, not questioning her claims when I knew I was right. I ’ ve tried my best to do as I ’ m told, I really have, but I ’ m only human, and humans make mistakes.  I made one of the biggest one mistakes of my life on the 25th of December, but it was one of the best. In the heat of the moment, I punched a man in the face, all because he made a comment about my mother to me. It was a spur of the moment thing, but sitting in that bar, knowing I ’ d sealed my own fate, I felt something I ’ d lacked for years. Peace.
Claire, my wife, did nothing but cry on the way home. She knew what I ’ d done to myself. But when she resigned herself to my fate, she thanked me. Part of me hates her for that, cause there ’ s a small chance just that tiny acknowledgement gets her put on the list right next to me.
I ’ ve had five months to reflect on my actions, to really think if that one punch was worth my death. The answer was easy to figure out – no. I ’ m not that stupid. But in my half a year, I ’ ve found freedom. I can have a drink after work if I like, I can fuck my wife, I can say fuck! I can throw on an old R rated movie and watch Arnold Schwarzenegger blow some shit sky high. I ’ m not saying I ’ ve been around the world on a pleasure cruise, living like a playboy for my final year. But I have lived, for the first time in seven years, I ’ ve lived.
And I wouldn ’ t trade that for anything.
Fuck you, Santa,
