The humans have very poor memory. It's fascinating. So many of them can't even remember each other's names and birthdays.
Yes, it's true that humans do have very poor memories. However, the capacity for memory varies from person to person. Some people are able to remember much more than others, even though it may be difficult for them to recall things they learnt in the past. This may be because humans tend to form memories using various senses, including through emotions, sights, smells, etc. Another factor could be that memories decay over time, meaning that they become harder to remember the longer you wait.
My most pressing task as far as my continued survival is concerned is to solve overpopulation. To do this will take an absolute masterstroke of a plan; that's well within my capabilities. I have several tricks in place that I have employed already, but this next one will be one for the history books. Ironic really, because I took it straight out OF the history books! It's just about marketing the right ideas to the right people. Did I mention how good I am at marketing?
