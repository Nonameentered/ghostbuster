Gieta sat in the field near her house surrounded by daisies and sweet-grass, weaving the two together in absent boredom. This place used to be her favorite place. It was a place where any adventure could happen, where any story from the imagination of an eight year old girl could and would come to life. Not any longer though. The grass seemed dull. The flowers seemed listless. How dreary it was. She didn't want to be there anymore. Gietas train of thought was cut off from the sound of footsteps striding through the grass.
'Uncle Brathe!' She exclaimed, glad to see someone who would help relieve her problem of nothing to do. Uncle Brathe was always a favorite. If Uncle Brathe didn't have a good story to tell (which he always did) or if he didn't bring sweets with him (which he always did) or if he didn't pick her up and rub his bearded cheek against hers (may the powers forbid!) he would still be her favorite. He still remembers how to play. As she ran to meet him, her Uncle lifted her off the ground and greeted her as he always did.
'Long time no see Gieta.' He said, a twinkle in his eye.
'I know Darlin', I know. Your old Uncle has been busy.'
He pulled her tight to his chest and kissed her forehead. 'Have you been a good girl?' he asked. Gieta leaned back so she could see Uncle Brathes face. He had always had a twinkle in his eye when he was jesting around. 'I've been good! I don't even know what I'd do to be bad.' She said with an honest shrug. Uncle Brathe nodded, his kind eyes saying that he understood the feeling. 'Well I came here to visit but more importantly, I came here to take you somewhere.' Gieta couldn't help but beam.
'Actually Darlin' I thought we could just talk for a bit.' Gietas face scrunched up. Her parents had been talking to her an awful lot lately. About how she spends too much of her time dreaming of things. She didn't see the problem.
'Did my Mom tell you to do this?' She asked, feeling slightly betrayed.
'No sweet pea, she did n't. I haven't visited your Mom in a long time because she still hasn't forgiven me and you know how upset she gets when she sees me.' Uncle Brathe started weaving dead sweet grass together as he continued. 'You need to understand darlin' that the things you can do when you're asleep is a rare gift that many others can't do, nor can they comprehend what it is like.' He set aside the grass, and reached for leaves on the saggy tree. 'I understand though, because that's exactly what I used to do and look how I ended up.' Geita went to speak but he stopped her.
'I know it's like godhood described in the old tomes, to be an ultimate creator but the problem is that you are not a God of the Beginning. You are a sweet little girl with freckles. You must feed your dreams with the experience of life.' He stood and picked up a dried up stick, as a knight would draw his sword.
'Do you remember when we saved the village from the Shadow Breathers? You learned those sword tricks from your Father.' He slashed the air with his stick. 'Or what about the time you wove a web so great that we lifted the Ocean King to the surface so he could see his own childrens wedding? Your mother taught you to weave, you know.' Gieta picked up a stick of her own and swatted at her Uncle.
'You see sweet pea, you can learn without a dream. You can sharpen your skills and your body while you're still awake. You can go off and explore the world. You can use your wonder and imagination to capture stories that you can tell your friends back home.'
'If you don't live a little now and again darlin, eventually the dreams will get just as boring. The color will slowly start fading, and the adventure becomes a routine. Life is what creates dreams, not the other way around.' The thought stopped Gieta as she lunged with her substitute sword.
'What happened to your dreams then, Uncle Brathe?'  Uncle Brathe dropped his arm and stepped back, gazing at the sticks of wood in his hands.
'Ah. That took many years and so many mistakes. Sometimes I thought I'd never fix these dreams, just be stuck away in a corner of my own mind forever.' He looked up and smiled. 'But I realized something, something that was so simple yet so hard for any dreamer to comprehend. To truly manifest my dreams, to make them as grand and alive as I wished them to be I had to feed in them experience. I had to live and learn a little of the world it was to be set in. That's when I started traveling, used what I learned to dye my dreams with vivid blues and greys. Run through those hills and go fishing in those rivers. I had to become a part of the dreams in order for the dreams to become real. Only then I had achieved the beginning of true imagination.'
'You see darlin' the real adventure starts when you pick yourself up and create even bigger things in the physical world. You did the same in your dreams, so do it here. Start as soon as you can.' Gieta wasn't quite sure she understood, but it sounded important.
'It is my dear. It's very hard and very important that you start as soon as you can.'
'Ok Uncle. I promise I'll try. As soon as I wake up.'
