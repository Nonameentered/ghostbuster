“ No, no no no... ” She backed up and turned the other way the second she saw me heading towards her.
“ Joanne? ” My voice startled her and she whipped her head around to face me. Her eyes were wide with surprise, almost fear.
“ You can ’ t be here, not now. I finally get this far and now you ’ re here. ” She was mumbling more to herself than to me at this point.
“ I-What-What do you mean? What are you talking about? ” I looked around, shifting uncomfortably.
She nodded but kept her head down.
“ What are you talking about? I- ”
“ We were best friends, true or false? ” She asked.
“ True, no false, I mean, we were friends but not… ” I looked at her once more to make sure she was actually standing there. “ You ’ re a dream, ” She froze at this.
“ No, no I ’ m- you ’ re a hallucination. I saw you for years! Every waking moment from- ”
“ Yeah, ” she sighed. “ I saw you since middle school. Everyday for years, it was like I was getting taunted and bullied by an imaginary friend. ” I tried to think back.  “ How can I – we- ”
“ Yes, that ’ s when you first showed up in my head. You were there when I was seven, and you disappeared when I was twelve. The last time I saw you was on a beach in Australia. ”
“ It was a dream, ” I said.
“ No, that actually happened. I was awake, I remember it exactly because that ’ s when I still lived in Australia with my parents. ” I looked at her, and began to realize something.
“ You saw me when you were awake, I dreamt you while I was asleep. I lived in Boston, when you lived in Australia. ”
“ Hold on, ” She sat down. “ My head hurts, ” She paused. “ We met, every day- ”
“ Every day for five years, ” I sat down next to her. “ We talked and laughed, until I fell out of the tree and we never talked again. ”
“ Every day. For five years, until we fell. What happened after that? ”
“ I moved away, you stayed in Australia, ” I said.
“ No, what happened for me? I don ’ t remember anything but falling head first and then… ”
“ Joanne, ” I looked her straight in the eyes this time. “ I woke up. ”
