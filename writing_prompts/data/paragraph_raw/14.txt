I'm really not sure why I took this job. I have family members who are retired Aurors. They view me with a mix of shame and despair. I've got family members who are pardoned Death Eaters, and they feel the same way.
I may not be the black sheep of the family, thanks to the aforementioned Death Eaters, but I don't get asked a lot of questions at family dinners.
But hey, family dinner conversations aren't why I'm where I am. I'm in a castle in northern Iceland, conducting high-risk research into powerful dark magic. I didn't always do this job, but here I am, doing it all the same.
I can't say it's a total shock that I ended up here. I was always a little different, even as a kid. Every other kid was interested in Quidditch and I decided I wanted to study Defense Against The Dark Arts. Of course, I always got top marks, but I don't think they'd ever take that seriously. That's why I wound up here.
My former supervisor taught me everything I needed to know about this rather shady job. When I started as his protege, he told me something that I'll never forget: 'Be prepared for anything.' That turned out to be a good piece of advice.
It wasn't easy but I worked my way up the ranks, from intern to researcher to sorcerer. I never thought I'd make it to supervisor, but here I am. Former supervisor got promoted to some minor position in the Ministry. A reward for taking a chance on a possible lunatic.
Damn
Now, I'm the boss. I have a new recruit. Fresh faced kid out of Hogwarts, who takes everything way too seriously. I worry about his ability to hold up in this line of work. Between the remote location and the dangers of our work, he's ripe to crack up.
'Welcome,' I say, taking the Kid by surprise. (He must've thought I was too busy with my work.) 'My name is Doctor Knox.'    He shakes my hand tentatively. 'It's a pleasure to meet you sir.' 'Let's get to it, Kid. We are here because the powers-that-be suspect an Old One may be stirring.'
'The Ministry wants us to start coming up with countermeasures, just in case the Old Ones rise.'
I take a sip of my coffee. 'That's what it means. Come up with traditional spells that a large group of wizards could use to put them back if they ever came. Be prepared. Not easy, obviously.' The Kid stares at me. He's utterly appalled by the idea. 'You mean you want us to create spells that could go up against gods? Isn't that's a bitâ€¦ excessive?'
'You're not at Hogwarts anymore, the stars could be right at any moment, then we all could be shit out of luck.'
I have to remind the kid of that a lot. He's still wearing his robes, looking like he's about to go to some damn Potions lecture. Meanwhile, I used a proven teleportation spell (I don't fuck around with those) to 'borrow' full SWAT Team gear from the Dallas Police Department. They have nice toys in Texas.
'Okay, so what are we going to do?' The Kid asks, finally beginning to get into the swing of things.
I take a deep breath before continuing. 'If an Old One were to actually start to rise, we would need a spell to banish it.'
The Kid looks at me, disbelief written all over his face. 'How the hell can we do that?' It's a good question. I'm still not sure. We do know what the ministry wants; a spell that can be used to, temporarily, send back any supernatural creatures that enter our dimension.  It's up to us to figure out the particulars. I'm the one doing the research after all. But I do know one thing...  'We have to make sure this spell is airtight.'
'Let me finish the preparation of the spell and you can start practicing the gestures,' I say after a few moments of silence. 'Make sure you extend your arm fully and keep the speed in check. Too slow and nothing happens, too fast and you'll redirect the spell inwards.'
'Well,' the Kid says after he finishes taking notes, 'what would that spell look like?' 'It'd be an extension of the summoning charm. Actually, you probably learned a variation of it in, where was it, fifth year?'
'Yes, I did. Although we never used that strange device at Hogwarts '
I shake my head. Hogwarts should really at least mention what a DVD players is to its students.
'Great, our fundaments are set. All we have to do is work on the incantation and practice the gesture.' Kid immediately tense up. He could recite spells in his sleep, but physically performing spells was another story.
'Alright,' he replies
'Remember: right arm fully extended, off to the side. Swing it in a controlled motion across your body.'
'I got you,' he says, a little more confident than I like. Damn Gryffindors are always like that.
We take a few minutes of drill and he gets the swing of it. 'Okay now, what's the incantation?' I ask.
'Piercus Four,' he answers.
'Good. Now, try it out,' I say.
The kid steps over to the other side of the room. As soon as he goes into the motion, I know it has gone to shit. He doesn't extend how arm far enough from his body and he moves way too fast. Before I can yell for him to stop, the fateful words come from his mouth.
'Piercus Four!'
The space around him blurs. By keeping his arm close and going too fast he redirects the spell at himself. My worst fears are confirmed when that space stabilizes.
There's nothing there.
Shit.
Now I have to go find him.
