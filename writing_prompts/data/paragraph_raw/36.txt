I've been trying to sleep. I have to work early tomorrow. If I fell asleep right now, I'd get about, I look at the clock, 6 hours if sleep. I'd have been asleep an hour ago if my FUCKING CAT WOULD SHUT THE FUCK UP! His nonstop meowing was driving me crazy. I let him out, I fed him, I was out of options.
'Just shut up please! Shut up or tell me what you want in English and I'll do it yourself stupid cat!'
And then something strange happened. I heard the cat meow again, but this wasn't his regular meow, this meow was deeper and more intelligible. It sounded almost like he was trying to speak in a human tongue. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I sat up in bed and looked at him and he was meowing again.
What?
Not gonna lie, I was a little freaked out. But I just shrugged it off as me being tired and my imagination running wild. Until he opened his mouth and said
Or was it?
What. The. Hell.
'You can talk?!' I practically shouted. My cat just looked at me with a glimmer of annoyance in his eyes.
Oh hell no. Okay, this was getting weird. I mean, it's my cat talking, and he wants me to quit my job and go on some weird adventure with him! 'Uh, well, uh...' I stammered, not sure what to say.
He cocked his head and looked at me as if I was stupid. 'Obviously.'
Gulp. I can't believe what I had just heard, my cat had somehow learned to talk. Now he's asking me to quit my job and go on some 'adventure' with him. What is this, Alice in Wonderland? No way am I going to leave my job for some random crazy cat adventure, what kind of ridiculousness was that? But I could've sworn he said something Smart.
'Of course! You want an adventure dont you? A real wild one? Well here it is, now make up your mind.'
'You know what, I'll do it. Tomorrow I'll go into work and quit.' I looked at my cat in disbelief and he smiled, knowing he'd won.
When I got home from work that night, sure enough, my cat was already packing up a bag. 'What have you got there?' I asked him, expecting an answer similar to when I asked him earlier. He only smiled and said, 'I'm just making sure we're both ready to go when the time comes.'
Suddenly my cat jumped dangerously high and landed on the back of my couch. He stared out the window, and then leapt off and sprinted upstairs and then back again, as if he were waiting for something.
He simply said 'You'll see.'  I stayed up the whole night, nervous of what I'd get myself into. My cat lay at the end of the couch, watching me. When the first rays of morning sun came, we both got up. I got dressed and he gave one last look at the door before turning away. 'Here we go.'  We walked towards the park, but we weren't playing. We were waiting.
'And when is this lady arriving? My questions still weren't quite answered but I figured it was better to keep him talking.  'Oh, any minute now, she'll be here.'
'Hello !?'
I ran to the corner to see a woman in a dark hooded robe, standing about 5' 7", standing in the corner. She had a strange glint in her eye and a smile that made me nervous, as if she was up to something.
'That lady.' My cat said snidely.
