He woke up with cracked lips and the taste of iron on his tongue. Rubbing a pain from his neck, he pushed himself up from the couch, a headache rushing to greet him like an unrelenting wave; he was parched.
He stood and made his way toward the kitchen, where he had set up for collecting the dew that sometimes gathered overnight during the monsoon months. It had been a fairly successful system of collecting what little bit could from the atmosphere, and he had been quite pleased after collecting several liters of what had seemed like clean liquid to survive the week.  There hadn't been much else, not for a very long time. He was among the last dozen kilometers of people left on the planet, unable to sustain a living in what had been otherwise the most plentiful and blessed land of his home. He knew there would be no respite, no end to the hardship that had settled on all of them. Â No way of truly getting out of this god-forsaken place.
And there would be no relief. Rains hadn't come for over a decade and efforts to resupply any region within a thousand miles of the equator had been abandoned. The heat was intense, the solar flares constant and unabated. Radiation had driven the land to desolation. And the population had moved on, searching for respite closer to the poles as any sane person would. But he could n't, not while she was still here.
He walked out the front door, watching the flagstone he had installed for her six years ago, the one she had helped him place. He knew she would have disapproved, too much extravagance invested for what amounted to a slab of stone. Perhaps that was why he had kept it there; a beckoning for her to return and reprimand him for such foolishness. He smiled, walking passed toward the derelict barn.
The stars, now seen in the sky, marked a time of a better life, a few months prior. The night he had returned home from the navy. The night he would hear of her death. The cemetery was walkable and he made the journey through the dark, his long strides eating up ground until he faced her familiar grave marker. His breath hitched and tears blurred his eyes. He had come to this spot every few days since it happened, but still no words escaped him. He reached out into the open, the wind lightly grazing over his arm and bringing him back to his old home.  Placing a hand on the field stone, he closed his eyes and remembered.
*Alexandria V. White Forever with her husband, James*
*Beloved wife, you are my everything*
He stared, fingering the engraving, and lost himself to a memory.  In the haze of their fifth anniversary, he had proposed the expansion of their small vegetable garden. She had sat in a chair, a drowsy grin on her face, as he had given his case. She had complied ultimately, and dozed off as he brought the argument to a close. Her laughter the next morning still made him smile - moments such as these kept his heart alight in these darkest of times.  But soon enough she had grown ill. The illness crept through her body in a matter of days, and he had done his best to keep her comfortable and cared for. He remembered her weakened state as the fever had taken her, feeling so helpless. Her last breaths and their final moments together blurred together tightly, her final words lost in time. It was the greatest pain he had ever felt. But one thing had remained clear - his dedication to her. He had promised that he would never leave her side, and so here he was, almost a decade later, still sitting beside her.
Memories of the damp rainy season, so long ago, flooded his mind. He could still feel his lovesick affections. When she had said no, it had been a sledgehammer to his heart that left him near broken. But he had been given a second chance and he had taken it, wasting no time in expressing his love, kissing her from head to toe in the rain as the thunder encircled them. He had chased her round and round, until lightning and love collided and they shared the same breath. The thought brought a faint smile and he smiled and he bowed his head to the grave, guessing at an emotion he hadn't felt in years; hope. But hope and expectation rarely ran parallel to one another, and though he had pressed on through the years, sorrow remained the only constant. She had been his friend since kindergarten, and he would do anything to make her stay, to make the pain stop.
He knew she wouldn't be fond of his decisions. Her words a few weeks before she passed kept coming back to him. '*Live,* James. I will be there to pull you through the gates, when the time comes. But do not waste yourself in grief or guilt. Travel. Learn. Do not stay here.' Well, he was selfish and he hadn't left. He couldn't leave.
He sat in silence for hours, running through the memories of their years together, until a deep threadbare tiredness filled him, and he fell asleep beside her.
...*Thud* He jerked back into consciousness, alone. And jolted back to set his fist where it was before he lost consciousness. He readied himself for a second, thinking about all the meat that used to be in his fridge and all the cold drinks he once drank. He thrust his fist into the ground, 'Food. Water. Please.' Suddenly he felt the mound shifting and he heard a *splish*, as if some secret deep underground could no longer remain so. He pumped again, and the sound repeated reluctantly, emerging from the same spot with greater force. He pulled his arm back and felt the mound move, like wet porridge. He leaned forward and smelt, and was greeted by a rich, wet earth. Unlike the baked dirt he was so used to, this was full, ripe and healthy. He reached his hands forward and pinched some mud between his fingers, pressing it into two discs between his palms. He seemed to realize something in that instance and, with a new surge of vigor, he moved forward and sunk his whole fist deep into the earth. He savored the feeling, the coolness, and when he pulled back his arm he watched fresh water spring out, dampening the dirt and the furrows of his hands.
He opened his hand, a gasp of surprise escaping him, for the mud had *molded itself* into a makeshift cup. Droplets of liquid sat at its bottom, enough for three swallows but no more. His throat rasped at the fleeting moisture, a feeling of absolute satisfaction flooding his senses. With some effort, he rose yet again and cast his sights at the sun above, let its rays pin him where he knelt, and watched as small wispy strands of vapor gathered in the sky. He knew what they were, and how he could pull them down.
He noticed a faint whisper in the wind, something akin to eminently familiar voice.
He reached out his hand again and opened his palm. The particles gathered there, a running droplet of water soon forming in its center. He shook the droplet alive and stirred it around his fingers and over his arm. He closed his eyes, feeling the liquid covering him as if the morning dew was all his own.
He looked around and, sure enough, the sky began to dimly weep. In moments, the cloudburst had overtaken the land, blessed water streaming over the dry surfaces, reviving the land and bathing us in an unwelcome glory. He fell to his knees in jubilation, tears mixing with the mud on his cheeks. His chest filled with the utmost of elation, however briefly, and he uttered a single quiet cry of joy.
He turned and headed back to the shack, his head up, his gait light. It was time to go.
'Goodbye Alexandria.'
