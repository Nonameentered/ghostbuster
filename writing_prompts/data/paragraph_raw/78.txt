'What does this mean?' I said.
'Oh, your son got the rules card. He's gon na be a lawyer,' the cardman replied.
That was unexpected. I mean, of course I wanted my little guy to do well in life, but lawyer? That seemed a bit extreme for a baby. I decided to ask the cardman for clarification.
The cardman looked me in the eye, 'sir, you know, you could have had any card you wanted for your son.' 'Yes, but the rules card, it's kind of like.... like a destined card, something that my son can - '
'No, no, no, please, I didn't mean it like that,' I said quickly. 'I just meant that I'd like to see what other future he can have. Please.'
'Are you asking me to change the card he's been dealt?' he said, an eyebrow raised.
'Well, no. Just, it seems unfair. Our son deserves a chance to prove himself. Is there any way to alter his card?' I said with a worried shake of my head.
He shook his head, 'wrong answer. Too many parents talk like that. Thinking their child will be a *normal*, when they themselves have a poisoned heart. Suitless people have made astounding contributions, sir.'
'There's nothing wrong with him wanting something different,' I said, trying to keep my voice level. 'There are plenty of careers out there without needing a bunch of rules and stuff.'
The cardman wheeled around on his heel to leave, but paused mid-stride. He turned slowly, 'are you a suitist, sir?'
'No! No, it's just that, my wife and I want grandkids and... umm... like this, he uhh, he couldn't even marry a two of cups, she's gon na be crushed. Please,' I begged.
He glared at me, clenched his fist, and cut our distance to mere feet and whispered, 'you *are* a suitist. And you can't see how bigoted that sounds,' he said, leaning in, 'guess what asshole, I was a blank and I'm better off than you, and he will be too.'
I hung my head in shame, feeling crass and foolish.
'Good,' he said, softening his voice, 'just recognize your privilege, and your son will be fine.'
I looked down at my baby boy, 'huh.'
