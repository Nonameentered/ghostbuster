The Moon, a Crack, and Conspiracies
It was a day like any other, until the moon changed. A hearty, deep gouge now runs through what looked like a perfect, bright crescent.  The town gathered from their home, curious and confused. Paul, my friend from college, turned to me and said “I’ve never seen anything like this.” That’s when I knew this was going to be something none of us were prepared for.
The Moon, a Crack, and Conspiracies
It was a rare sunny day in my hometown. I could see children running around screaming joyfully while the adults set up a barbeque party. I was about to light up a cigarette when I heard a collective gasp from a whole block away.  Of course, any addiction and small pleasures were forgotten as most of the citizens ran out of their homes and business offices to see what the commotion was about.  We all looked up… and there in the sky, between the bright and fading stars…. was a massive crack on the surface of the moon. It was massive - a half moon in itself. The edges were searing as if the mountains of the moon had been alight. There were whispers of some kind of blast, something blew up the surface of the moon and planted this giant canyon.
It seemed like the whole town was out here; Jones was at Harry ’ s talking about the surreal nature of the slit. Denise was here with her flowery white dress telling everybody that this is the end of the world. Old Viveca, who lives on the big hill at the edge of town, has been talking of bad omen.  The town went silent like a blanket had just been put over us… then came the sound. A
whole heck of a lot of commotion. There ’ s Wendy, still in that same red dress from last night, standing with her two kids. You can see Jones running away from Harry ’ s Bar carrying a bottle of liquor in his pocket. Old Viveca, she ’ s still walkin ’ slow and heavy, talking to herself. lit up like a Christmas tree. People are out here, out of our
homes and gathered at the main intersection of our town, all of us just looking up, speechless. Even the usually chatty Harv was quiet, holding his head and looking so scared. We could all feel… something in the air, something bad.  Harry had come out of his liquor store, and a few of the other locals came out of their shops and houses looking just as confused. I heard a few muttered words here and there, like “what the hell?!” and, “what is that?” but most of us were speechless, just standing and looking. even Jones, the town drunk, looked sober and nervous… he was holding onto Harry ’ s shirt for dear life.
“ Aliens. ” Paul ’ s statement surprises me, we haven ’ t gone through the roaming thought of others, so when Paul say ’ s it, it ’ s like something goes off in my head. We were standing in front of Harry ’ s Bar, watching all the people roos and worry. Jones steps out, his usual white V- neck shirt and jeans, a complimentary pack of Marlboro Reds in his hand. Yeah, Jones is here.
“ Naw, they ain ’ t doin ’ shit about this… and if they are, sure as hell not
gonna say much. ” Paul answers.
Paul stands silently for a moment, before he adds… “ This looks like somethin ’ out of a movie. Aliens that ’ s what I ’ m sayin ’. ” “ Man, stop it. ” The conversation ceases. I turn away from Paul and look at the circle of people in front of me. Harry and his barflies, all of which are
looking straight up at the moon. I look back, and Jones is going back into
Harry ’ s, probably the get his hands on some free liquor. Wendy and her
messed up, but kind hearted family is still here too, held together by love… and probably enough booze to fill an Olympic size pool. “ It ’ s not Aliens, ” I said. “ You don ’ t know that, man. ” Paul replies. “ I was watchin ’ this show the other night, it said Aliens built the pyramids, no doubt this is another one of their works. ” Paul ’ s eyes were still glued up to the gaping chasm in the moon…
unnerving.
“ Ya think the government planted this? ” Paul finally said, breaking the silence. “ It could be some test they wanna do, right? But at the same time, maybe they just want us all to see somethin ’ like this… ” “ Yuh think it ’ s Aliens? ” I said, still trying to make sense of all this. Paul begins to laugh, “ Aliens? Nah, not at all, ain ’ t nobody got time for that man… No, I ’ m talkin ’ bout the gov, the real ones, the ones they don ’ t teach in school. Ya know, the secret ones. ” “ Paul, please tell me you are not believing in conspiracies. Even I know we do not have the evidence to support that. ” Paul takes a deep breath. “ Yuh know… I can ’ t say for sure… but I got a feelin ’… somethin ’ real heavy is about to take place, and they don ’ t want us to know about it. They ’ ve been pushin ’ this space force shit lately… this is like the perfect opportunity for them to — ”  “ Yeah but the evidence — ” “ To what? To come in here and start bulldozing all the homes and farms around here? C ’ mon my man, they ain ’ t gon na do that. We ’ re here for one reason… this crack… it ’ s in the perfect spot… they got the technology for
this.. whatever it is… I bet they ’ re already plannin ’ a way to take it over and make sure no one outside of the US gets access to it. ” “ What they gonna do with it? ” I ask. “ Whatever they want, ” Paul replies. “ Most likely plannin ’ on gettin ’ somethin ’ out of it… like energy, or even worse
harnessing that energy some sort of way. ” I stood there, brows furrowed. “ What ’ s that got to do with aliens? ” “ Aliens are workin ’ with the government, man! ” Paul points toward the moon with two fingers. “ Seein ’ this crack, this slit… it ’ s some sort of weapon. Like a portal or somethin ’ for the government to harness the energy of the sun ; the energy they ’ re takin ’ and workin ’ on,
and create a space weapon… and aim it at…
oh, and Taiwan. ”
I pause, and think for a bit. “ Jones is right, you ’ re gonna put too much stock into conspiracy theories. Why would someone do that? ” Paul scoffs. “ They ’ re always plannin ’ that kinda stuff, Vince. Sure as hell
should ’ ve addressed that last... right after addressing the rest of that
nonsense.  “ Hey, ” Paul continued without missing a beat. “ You thinkin ’ what I ’ m thinkin ’? ”
“ Yeah… well don ’ t mean Taiwan ain ’ t an enemy… ” Paul tries to save his point but he forgets. “ Still don ’ t make sense to me why they ’ d use that on anybody and not just keep it as a secret weapon. ”
Boom, that ’ s why I think it ’ s have somethin ’ to do with the government. ” Jones seems to agree as he raises his bottle of Captain Morgan to the masses.
Paul keeps talking while people start to move away… Denise, who I always had a crush on from high school, leaves with her mother and brother. Wendy just keeps looking at the moon with her two kids, and Jones
is also looking up. She was too pretty to be here, she probably got
her son move in next door to her… probably to keep an eye on him from
her home and rest, likely missing her dead husband.
I think to myself, guess it ’ s just gonna be Paul and I figuring out what this is. I look back to Paul and him now smoking a cigarette and still talking- “. . . and I heard, from like two sources, that this ’ ll get bigger… and when it does, then that ’ s when shit is really gon na hit the fan. ”  “ What ’ s that supposed to mean? ” I say, now a little interested. “ Weapons…. missiles… deep shit… like, world-endin ’ stuff. ” “ Just how sure are you? ” I said, I ’ m sure my furrowed brows and raised eyebrows display my skepticism. Paul looks up from his cig and says, “ shit, don ’ t know… but there is one person that knows more that may help. Randy. ” I frown “ Randy? ” “ Yeah, you know, by Harry ’ s. His grandpa went to the moon…. “ “ What, like multiple times? ” Paul shook his head, “ Nah, just once. Long time ago. ” I just stare at him for a few moments trying to piece all the pieces together until it snaps. “ Randy ’ s grandpa?? Went to the moon?
once? ” Paul stops and scratches the back of his head.
“ Yeah, he did, but I don ’ t think that old man knows anythin ’ ” Paul said.
“ You think he know somethin ’ about this? ” Paul asks.
Paul stops and thinks. “ Yeah. He might have some answers. Clint! Let ’ s go to Randy ’ s. ”
So Paul and I leave the commotion… my mind deciding whether I want to
believe Paul or find out what Randy knows about his grandpa ’ s trip to the moon. We knock on a few more doors, but eventually find our way to Randy ’ s cafe. He runs a small cafe on the outskirts of town. It ’ s peaceful, and we can hear the crickets coming from the forest behind his cafe.
On the way back, I ran into Randy… and asked if he could talk to us for a bit, and he agreed. Pushed my bike to his place, and Paul and I Climbs a few steps up, and Paul and I stopped at Randy ’ s stoop and  Paul and I both look up… past stars, past clouds and more stars…. past space… and we saw the gigantic slit in the moon… words can ’ t do it justice. Just a giant slit of light, almost like a doorway. We shiver and
knock on his door. Randy ’ s face peaks out…. I can tell he ’ s visibly shaken.
“ Hey Randy. ” I say
“ Sure as hell saw it! ” He almost shouts back as he closes the door just a bit, “ Who are you? What you want? ”
“ Yeah… don ’ t know what it is, but we were wonderin ’ if you or ya grandpa
might know somethin ’ or somebody who can help. ”
Randy looked away for a few seconds, then back at us… his face serious and anxious.  It became clear he was ready to tell us something, something only he knew… something big.
“ Neither, ” Randy said in a stern voice, I could see his eyes getting watery over here face. “ You know what it is then? ” Paul asks excitedly. “ Grandpa never said the name, ” Randy said, sadness consuming his voice. “ But he did tell me somethin ’ once… a few years before he died… I was just a kid, barely remember my momma ’ s face. He
said what… but all he said was it ’ s bad… like real bad… like deep shit bad. ”
“ You think we should tell the authorities? ” I asked him in a worried voice.
He pauses and looks toward the moon. “ I don ’ t know if I ’ m comfortable telling y ’ all… don ’ t wanna get too many people in trouble. ”
Randy opens to the door more, we step in and talk for a few hours….. turns out… maybe everybody ’ s time on earth is about to get real shorter…
