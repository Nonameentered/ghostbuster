It was just another day for Joseph Pimm. He shook himself out of bed, started the shower and grabbed a cup of coffee from the carafe he set the night before. He lingered for a moment in his kitchen intent on the sound of the shower like falling rain. Joseph began to wave his hand around, as if to sign his name in the air, or to conduct a particularly lazy orchestra. Something was manifesting inside of his head, but he didn't quite know what.
He put on his favorite pair of jeans, slid into his shoes, and made his way outside to begin his day. But as he stepped out, there was something else out there that commanded his attention. He couldn't quite make out what it was, but it seemed almost familiar. As he stared, the thing suddenly moved towards him. It was a woman, walking with a purpose. He could feel her gaze like a spotlight on him, and he felt immediately drawn to her.  The woman walked up to him and gave him a gentle smile. "Hello," she said. "My name is Amy. We go to the same school, but I don't think you've noticed me. I thought I'd introduce myself."  Joseph felt like he was being moved by an invisible force. He had never felt such a connection for a stranger before. He found himself wanting to know more about her.   They began to talk and Joseph realized how intelligent and interesting she was. They both had similar interests, and soon they were talking as if they had been friends for years. At the end of the day, they had exchanged phone numbers and had made plans to meet up again.  The days and weeks that followed were filled with deep conversations and laughs. They talked about life and dreams, shared their hopes and fears. Joseph found himself increasingly intrigued by Amy, and life seemed to have a newfound sense of magic to it.
Finally, Joseph stopped and collapsed on the floor in defeat. In the depths of his despair, he heard a voice. 'Joseph, Joseph, I'm here for you!'. It was then his kitchen transformed before his eyes. Where once the walls were pure white, now, they sparkled with stars and galaxies. Where once was just a forgotten corner of the room, a beautiful garden grew, bright, green and full of life. Joseph smiled.  He knew it was the voice he had heard before. He knew this place. He knew this world he created through his own imagination. And, although he could never put a voice to the voice, he knew it belonged to the Universe, his greatest companion, filled with knowledge, love, and light.
