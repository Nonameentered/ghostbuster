Note: I just watched Episode 1 of Season 4 and haven't read any of the books, so I don't know what happens after that. Please no spoilers! This is also my first WP post, but constructive feedback is welcome. Also, just for fun I tried to do an unofficial screenplay format, hence the weird capitalization.
--- Game of Thrones, Season 4 Episode 2 Cold Hands, Warm Hearts
We open on a very wide view of a majestic Gold Hall. Two sets of tall, golden stairs slowly descend from the left of the frame, with two separate towering thrones set atop them both. The camera slowly zooms out until the faces of the two thrones can be seen, and a man and a woman are seen seated in them, faces expressionless.  The man is JON SNOW, hands folded in his lap. The woman is DAENARYS Stormborn, her black locks and iconic silver boots partially visible. The silence is broken by the thump-thump of slowly approaching footsteps.
Cut to a wider shot, we see a staircase leading up to the throne. The steps are made of weathered stone and lined with worn flags, hung years ago.
Pan right, and we see SAMWELL TARLY, all grown up now, wearing the Maester's robe and chain. The camera then slowly zooms out to show the two figures. SAM faces DAENARYS who has a look of determination in her eyes.
Looking from behind SAM we see DAENARYS in the throne which towers above her head. To her right stands SIR JORAH, after all these years, he's still protectively looking over her. The Hand of the King's medallion hangs from his armor.
DAENARYS: What news have you brought? SAM: Your Grace, Castle Black has been breached. The wildlings and their army of White Walkers are moving south, headed straight for Winterfell.
DAENARYS: What do you advise, Grand Meister? Can we do anything?
SAM: We need to find the ancient text known as The Horn of Winter. It may contain information on how to stop the Army of the Dead, or at least weaken them. DAENARYS: Where can we find this text?  SAM hesitates, almost afraid to say the word.
The camera shifts position as it moves back somewhat. SAM continues the thought as we slowly fade to black.
SAM :... blood magic.
Silence.  SAM: But it could be our only chance to save The Wall.
JORAH: If I may, your grace, it might behoove us to seek an alternate solution - something else that may void us from the need of the dark arts. The camera tilts up and we see DAENARYS' face soften as she looks at JORAH, her eyes twinkling with a knowing affinity for him. She believes in him and his capabilities and trusts him explicitly.
DAENARYS: I hope to not need it. But if the wall may be breached, we must be prepared. In the meantime, my smiths work tirelessly to make swords and attows of Dragonstone, and convoys arrive weekly at Castle Black with these weapons and reinforcements. And Jorah, you must stop calling me that. I am...
She stands, the room quiets and the theme song plays in the background, growing louder until the end of her sentence.
DAENARYS: ... Daenerys, the Seventh of Her Name, Protector of the Realm and Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar and the First men.
Still facing her, we hear
JORAH and SAM (in unison ): Yes, my queen.
Fade Out.

Fade in to a beach. The waves crash against the rocks and the sun is setting over the water. We hear laughter and the squeak of children's shoes.
The camera pans upwards until we see a small group of children playing with wooden swords on a grassy field a ways from the beach. A woman stands in front of them, a sword fighting teacher. The camera continues upwards. We see a small castle, with a balcony over the field. Two figures sit on the balcony, indistinguishable. The camera glimpses a reflection off a golden hand.
The camera now zooms closer to the balcony until we recognize the man as JAMIE. He's looking out to the field but is clearly not focused on what's happening. Next to him, BRIENNE is looking forlornly at something off in the distance.  The camera zooms further in until we see what BRIENNE is looking at. It's ARYA, the sword teacher. Her back is towards the castle but she senses something and looks up until her gaze meets Brienne's from the balcony. They both grow still, and the moment lengthens. Finally, ARYA looks away and continues with her lessons.
BRIENNE: You know, I never expected this life for either of us. JAMIE, wistfully: I know. But I wouldn't change it for the world. We still have each other. They look into each other's eyes and laugh. Cut to a low angle of the field. We see ARYA walking up towards them, a stern look on her face. As she gets closer, they stand up, a slight nervousness now on their faces. ARYA addresses the children without breaking her gaze. ARYA: Alright you lot! Put those play swords away and line up, it's time for real practice
ARYA: Alright, that's it for today. And remember, what do we say to Death?
The children enthusiastically shout  CHILDREN: Not today!
The camera shifts to a closeup of ARYA and follows her movements.
ARYA: Hah! Good job. Now go wash up and get ready for dinner.
The children obediently run inside, one of them calling her "Aunty Arya." The camera follows ARYA into the castle, which we now recognize as the seat of House Tarth. As she enters, JAMIE and BRIENNE stand up and join her. JAMIE: Looks like you made an impression, milady. ARYA: It's been a long time since I taught the Younger Starklings. I'm a bit rusty. JAMIE: I'd say you did great. The camera cuts away to a wide shot of the three, who are now facing each other.  ARYA: I should get back to Winterfell. I still have unfinished business there. Brienne stands a step in front of Jamie and places her hand on the older lady's shoulder, warmth radiating from her face. BRIENNE: You have a home here now. We'll keep your place warm for whenever you are ready to come back.
The camera pans to face a large door on the side of the castle. ARYA climbs a flight of stairs and stops at a wooden door. She takes a deep breath and pushes it open. We are now in the room JAMIE and BRIENNE were sitting in - but this time, their shape is distinguishable. We can just make out JAMIE's signature golden hand resting on the balcony railing. ARYA catches sight of them and stops. We see the emotions on her face - mixed feelings of joy, sadness, and confusion. Why were they here? She steps back slowly, closes the door, and turns away. We follow ARYA, in silence, as she slowly walks away from the castle. We still hear the distant sound of the sea and suddenly, the sun appears on the horizon. ARYA stops, and turns to gaze at the scenery before her - the sun setting over the Sapphire Isle. She smiles. FADE TO BLACK

I had to stop here today, but I have an idea for the storyline which I'd like to write if anyone's interested in me continuing.
