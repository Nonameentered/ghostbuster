This is my first one of these, so be gentle.
Everything Burns
Every so often, a great fire brings death and destruction and chaos, leaving little more than scorched earth and burnt dreams in its wake.  The Great Fire of Rome. The Great Fire of London. The Great Fire of Chicago.
Fires from a careless spark, ignited in careless haste, can tear a city down, start a war, kill millions in a blink of an eye. There are no safe harbors from a fire, it's a force of nature that claims all victims equally, it has no morals, no prejudices, no ideals. Fires have the capacity to wipe entire civilizations off the face of the Earth, and they do it with an almost effortless glee. A single home fire can take away a family, a forest fire can be so encompassing that it blots out the sun, an industrial fire can put an entire nation into an economic depression.
Not only Buildings, Castles, cities, Empires have been torn asunder by the devastating effects of flame, but also the lives of those within them.
But only till recently has this been remembered.
What if the flames won? What if nothing else but fire tore through homes, businesses, families, cities, countries, and all throughout the world?
It started with the little things, that people shrugged off as nothings too worry about. Little fires here and there, too often to be coincidences.
Then it started spreading, slowly at first, but quicker and quicker soon fire consumed cities, towns, villages, forests, homes. No one could prevent it, no one could stop or stop it, it became a reality that everything could and would burn.
The scientists found something when the fires started to spread everywhere and the whole world was burning, the air was thick with the smoke... they found something that had been released in the air. An airborne virus that made the fires burn hotter, faster and wilder causing devastation on a global scale.
The became more intense and the devastation more widespread and eventually, no one was safe. The entire world was burning.  Now, humanity is reduced to cinders, and all that remains of our once great civilizations are ruins of ash and smoke. What remains of our once grand cities and structures is nothing but charred remains.   But something positive rose from the ashes. A newfound respect for the potential of nature and for the fragility of humanity. We finally understand that the same fire that symbolized our energy and ambition can also be our downfall.
People ran, or turned to ash, some just stayed behind and chose fate.   No city was spared, there was no region or place to hide. We die in the ashes.   And yet, from the ashes and in a time that the world thought was forgotten, a party arises.  A team of individuals whose mission was simple: fight fire. Wherever, whenever, for however long it takes. They were determined to slow it down, to protect what isleft and to eventually hopefully put out the fires that ravage the world.  This is their story, a testament to all humanity that in even the darkest of times, even from the depths of the fires, knowledge, courage and hope can arise.  This is the story of those who chose not to accept that everything burns, and that the fires can be stopped.
Everything burns.
