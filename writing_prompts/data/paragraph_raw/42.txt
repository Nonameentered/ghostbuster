We'd been wandering for what felt like years. I would have written down my adventures for later generations, but writing hadn't been invented yet. We set up camp near the mountain. It was supposed to offer defense, but from what we weren't sure. Military hadn't been invented yet either.
Before long we had developed a way to communicate. Then another camp sprang up a few tiles away from us. Another camp, then some more caravans to settle more cities. Things were moving at a hectic pace!
We learned how to work with metal, how to make buildings, and train soldiers. This was all within the first couple weeks. It was like some... higher power was guiding our development, but I couldn't say for sure.
We soon developed navigational techniques and even inter-planetary travel. Rendering of the stars revealed a gas giant two solar systems away, and it seemed like the best place to settle. We haven't arrived there yet, but we're making good progress and our ships can warp through space.
I've been alive on this planet for almost 10 weeks now, and I just hope I stay alive long enough to see our civilization expand to Alpha Centauri.
