'For the safety and well-being of all local citizens this warning will be broadcast silently.'
The end of the message is quickly met with static, soon replaced with another message.
And then it clicked. Someone was sending me some kind of message.
I paused, not sure if I was more alarmed by the message or the fact that it was appearing without me pressing the power button. I stood still, listening for something over the sound of my racing heart.  Nothing.  I took a deep breath before I slowly made my way to the bedroom and grabbed my phone. A quick glance at the news sites showed nothing, nothing at all about auditory hallucinations.
I sighed, and stretched, and got my coffee. As I settled at the table, I heard a strange noise coming from the television. At first, I assumed it was just feedback — but then, I heard a woman's voice over the static.
“ It's the government!” she exclaimed in a low voice, panicked. “My God, it's happening! There are people... voices inside everyone's heads, telling us to do things. Don't listen to them! Don't believe them! Don't trust them! Just... sit down, cover your ears, and don't look around. Please. It's the only way.”
My heart started to race as I scrambled to the corner of the room to pull the plug on the speakers. I didn't want to take any chances. This couldn't be a good sign.
New text scrolled across the television screen, error-ridden as if it was being typed with frantic speed. “ Please do nt listen to anything that you heaf. we do not know what is happening at this time. Unplug all speKERS AND RADIOS. IF IN BUILDING WITH PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM, LEAVE BUILDING IN ORDERLY FASHION. Do not listen to voices. Do not close your eyes. Please communicTE IN WRITING, DO NOT TRY TO SPEAK. DO N'T LISTEN PLEASE DO N'T TRUST VOICES. ”
