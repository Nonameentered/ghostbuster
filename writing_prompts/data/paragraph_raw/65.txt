Claire discovered her ability when working on her first child.
Claire had only ever dealt with the dead, but this time it was different. She was working on a live case; same as any other day. It's usually just paperwork or interviews that she does, which Claire loves. She hates the thought of someone's life ending too soon.
But the little boy who laid before Claire, naked except for a paper-thin white sheet covering his genitals, he hadn't experienced anything except for the shit luck that the world had bestowed upon him.
'Oh God,' Claire said, covering her mouth with one hand, and pushing back the flap of skin that had folded down from his forehead and covered his left eye. It was there, that his head must've collided with the asphalt. The rest of the family was fine after the car crash, but a faulty booster seat and faulty car door spelled doom for the three-year-old who wouldn't make it junior high, much less elementary school.
'Oh *God*,' Claire said again, this time with a hint of anger in her wavering voice. If there was a 'God', how in the hell could he ever let something happen to a child? Someone who was too young to probably even understand what life and death was?
Claire shook her head and blinked away the tears that were brimming in her eyes. 'No,' she whispered, shaking her head again. 'Not this time.'
Claire opened her eyes and shook her head.
'Bullshit,' she whispered, laying her hand on the boy's sternum. It was then that she felt a heartbeat.
She didn't understand what was happening, but she could feel a slow, but steady pulse coming from his chest. She got up and grabbed the stethoscope, which confirmed that he was breathing, although very shallow. Claire had no idea what was going on, but immediately started performing CPR, desperately trying to revive the boy. After what seemed like eternity, the little boy stirred, opened his eyes and started wailing.  The relief was immense, and Claire wept with joy. She knew what she just did was impossible. The doctors told her she performed a 'miracle', but when Claire looked in the mirror she saw old age, exhaustion and sadness in her eyes mirroring the death of everyone she had resuscitated.
***
Claire never performed a miracle again - not intentionally.
But it didn't stop Claire.
Every single time she was presented a child under the age of five, she performed a miracle. Things became difficult when people started learning of the undertaker who brought the dead to life, and countless times Claire had to move and change her name.
But the funny thing about it, the more Claire performed these miracles, the older she became, and with the aging, came the changing of her facial features.
People began to marvel and gossip of how she had been a young woman only a few years earlier, and of the supernatural powers she must harness. They concocted stories of witchcraft, the devil's work, and of course, princesses who were cursed for something they never did.  But none of these stories were true. All it really was, was the price of doing what Claire did; bringing the dead back to life. Each miracle she performed left a little bit of life taken from her own. For each life she brought back fron the clutches of the reaper, she aged five years, until one day, she looked like a 100 year old woman, despite only being thirty four.

And so Claire went on, much older than her years, and far stronger of a person than anyone could ever imagine. Then one day, a woman in her early 40s went into the hospital complaining of sudden chest pains, but exited it in a body bag. Claire was called to the hospital when the body came in. She figured, just like always, she'd perform her miracle on the woman, spray her with embalming fluid, and pass her body onto the family, all the while feeling a little bit of satisfaction in her work. But when she saw the woman lying there, cold and dead, Claire felt something new.  She felt a responsibility for the woman.
The family was beyond grateful, but sorrow for what had happened still lingered in the air. The woman saved had almost died, but Claire was able to bring her back. Her skin was pale, her eyes wide and unseeing, and as she woke, her body shook with silent sobs. Claire simply stood there, looking at the woman, feeling the peace break through the room as the woman's family surrounded her and wept with joy.
Her family wailed in the background as Claire laid her hands on the woman's chest, calling for the life to come back into her body. It took two hours and forty-seven minutes, but eventually the woman opened her eyes and everyone in the room held their breath. Claire, however, collapsed on the floor and died with a smirk on her face.
She felt the last of her life escape her through the tips of her fingers, and Claire collapsed in the silent room. In her mind's eye, she saw the Reaper come for her, still smiling the same smile from the day she performed her first miracle, but this time, Claire smiled back.
*You take plenty from this world, I know you do, but it must sting to know I took some back from you.*
