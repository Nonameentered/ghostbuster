'Assembled ladies and gentlemen, students and faculty members, please refrain from delivering any pointless verbal interactions. Any essential communications shall be emitted only by my computational device.' Dr Mehmed smoothed his snowy white laboratory coat, pristine mustache perched on his upper lip.
Eddie, the bane of the astronomy elective, was about to open his mouth to query the bizarre statement, but fell silent as Dr Mehmed continued speaking, his lips not even moving. 'Calculations point to the successful re-entry of an intergalactic probe, one presently orbiting around Tangerines Major. According to the navigation parameters, the intersection with the Upper Atmosphere Surveillance Net is slated to occur in a mere minute. Shall we give it a go?'.  The class stayed silent, too astonished at what was happening to even breathe. Dr Mehmed had just predicted the re-entry of a probe that was currently in orbit around another planet? Impossible! Eddie couldn't help but feel a sense of awe at the sheer mental capability of the professor, and hoped deep in his heart that the prediction was accurate.  Dr Mehmed tapped a few keys on the computer in front of him, a map of Tangerines Major in full and vivid colour appearing on the projector screen. A yellow dot appeared on the map, zooming in closer and closer until an intricate series of symbols could be seen tracing the route of a single dot.
'Observe the graphic display before you, if you will. 25 minutes ago, I instructed the satellite to report what it witnessed at precisely 11: 45: 04'. Stifled laughter broke the stillness of the room and Dr Mehmed narrowed his eyes, one finger sending a small ripple across the large display. 'Silence. If I am right, a sizeable object from beyond our own solar system shall be convenient to view shortly'.
The silence in the room was deafening, all eyes were glued to the screen, expecting some miracle answer to the mysterious disappearance of the trillion-dollar NASA project.   The room was held in suspense until the final seconds ticked away, laughter erupting from the group accompanying by scattered applauds. The atmosphere in the room had changed dramatically, the dire anticipation of moments before replaced with a euphoric wave of school pride.
Suddenly the image blinked, swivelling to the far side of the planet. The satellite was following something as it made its way across the atmosphere. A bright yellow haze lit the edge of the earth, an unseen signal travelling faster than the eye could see.   As the camera zoomed in, the brightness shifted to a pillar of light, and there-- a vaguely familiar object, trailing a plume of fire from one end. It was a probe launched by the space agency a few days ago.  The silence was absolute, the sheer madness of the situation breaking down in the faces of the crowd as an unspoken understanding swept in.
Tim, a student at the back of the class, began to clap, which was quickly followed by the slow applause of each and every student in the classroom. Throwing a sharp look at the clapping, Dr Mehmed raised an unearthly finger to stir its audience into silence.  'This,' He said in a grave tone, 'is but the work of a single mind. A single group of scientists, driven by a single purpose. We, as scientists, shall strive to work together for a single cause. Never shall we be severed by cause and effect.' He paused, letting the eerie aura in the air linger. 'No matter the cause, our research will achieve the effect we desire.'
The students were speechless. Even the tech-savvy amongst them had never witnessed such a feat. Dr Mehmed had truly managed to access and manipulate a multi-billion dollar interstellar mission, solely using his mind.
The classroom broke out in applause, amidst conversations of disbelief.  'Do not assume this to be a trivial matter.' began Dr Mehmed sternly, silencing the once boisterous classroom. 'This was a very complex situation, requiring a great deal of skill to pilot the Voyager safely and precisely. It serves as a reminder of the potential power of knowledge and technology. Now... if you'll excuse me, I must confirm the results before the authorities arrive.'  The words had barely died away when the door burst open, a figure in black military fatigues and body armour barrelling through at great speed. A sharp voice cried 'FREEZE!' and the room fell silent, as a dozen more figures came swarming in, each pointing a deadly weapon at the astonished doctor and his students.
'FREEZE!' screamed the commanding officer. Obviously outraged by the professor's idea of fun, but also immensely impressed by his feat, he ordered his men to apprehend the professor. In a daze, Tim blurted 'You! You're a secret agent!'  The other students in the room were just as shocked, mouths agape. They had all heard stories of the mysterious government organization known as DARIN - the Defense Agency for Renewable Institutes of Nations. The professor had led them all to believe that he was a teacher - not some covert agent.  The officer sneered, 'That's right. You should have known better than to challenge a doctor. Who could have predicted what would happen? The professor, on the other hand...'  He narrowed his eyes at Dr Mehmed and continued, 'You have some explaining to do.'
'We have received intel that this one has breached military protocol, transferring confidential data offline in an unapproved manner.' announced one of the soldiers, as a multitude of lenses and gun barrels converged on the doctor.
'MEHMED!' roared the headmaster, charging into the room. 'WHAT HAVE YOU DONEâ€½ '
