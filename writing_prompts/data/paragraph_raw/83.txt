It's frustrating to only have one of something.
My life is an example of this. I come from a place where coal is the only commodityâ€”a place I call Death's Holler. Everyone here knows of our situation. We are surrounded by rich ground that wants nothing else to do with us. We were a great people back then. We had our traditions, our culture, and our own kind of respect. We were miners, and the coal was our currency. It was something we could offer to the world.
But then there was a drought.
I do not go to the market anymore; frequent trips have emptied our heirloom pouch of silver coins. My father, a strong man, drives the northern road on a half-broken cart in search of a new trade. We block the misfortune of the cold and dark with conversations of promised horizons. I learn of endless possibilities, and dad regales me with stories of gods and heroes. He speaks of Death's Holler. Of a valley so steep and so deep, that even the bravest of men hesitate to tread its path. It is said that at the bottom lies an alter to a forgotten god; long forgotten by us, but not by itself. He promises me that in this valley lies our fortune, for it is said that only the bravest of deeds will bring this god's gaze upon us. I am to go forth and do something bold enough to capture the eye of a forgetful god.
I walk now down an old path between mounds of coal, relics of a past life. Here, the air smells like an ashes, the trees bisect the horizon like daggers. Solid shapes crawl out of the shadows in the night. Statues, long-forgotten by their makers, their faces contorted in fear, anger, or despair, all too similar to the emotions I feel rising with the morning sun.
I'm brought back to attention by a steady, soft light at the end of the valley. I make my way over cautiously, throwing a glance at the carvings at regular intervals. The torchlight reveals a single path, as though beckoning me forward. There is no door or gate, no warning or sign. I wonder if I should turn back, but my feet keep walking.
In the center, is another statue. Unlike the ones I had seen before, this one was carved from a different stone than the surrounding valley. This one sat upon a throne, and though without arms, it held a scepter in its skeletal hands. A faint smile was sculpted on its face as if it were amused by my presence.
It almost looks as though the bones are grinning. I can not say whether this is an illusion caused by the lighting or by the skeleton's clothing, but I am met with what almost looks like a welcome. I look away, unnerved, before consulting my notes for instructions. The parchment is silent, so I guess I am to proceed unguided. I swallow and take three steps forward so that I am standing at the altar. I look up to meet the eyes of the stone gods. They seem to recognize my presence and murmur in a voice that is not quite real or imagined. *You have come. Now what do you offer?*  I hesitate, uncertain. Offer what? Coins? Jewelry? My life?  *Do not stand there, boy! Offer up something worthwhile!*  The hushed yet demanding tone of the voice causes me to take a step back. I look around for something of use and my gaze lands on the knife at my belt. It is a family heirloom through many generations, worth more to me than anything else. But if I offered it, could they even use it? What could they do with it?
My fear must have made its way to the surface, as I can feel the hairs on the back of my neck stand tall. I turn my head slowly to the chamber's center. Above the altar sits a basin, much like a bowl. I take a step closer, my hand finding my side before steeling my body and crossing the threshold. I can hardly breath as I move towards the alter, ready to give what is asked of me. Then, a voice appears in my head:  'Child, give me the price of your soul.'
I inhale deeply. I suppose I knew this was a possibility when I signed up for this task.
I reach up and take my own pulse. It beats strong and steady, and I offer it up to the alter.
*My boy, I'm going to need more than that.*
