Chief of the Engi, Saluy son of Davok son of Rofuy spoke 'We are the Engi. My father told this story of our beginning: Our gods cast us from the garden for our many crimes against them. Cut us out like bad crops and tossed us into the stars. The elders say that one day, the gods will call us home and forgive us; that by following their laws we may atone.
We Engi landed in this place, the hab we now call home. It was dark and cold, but the soil held meat and metal and the air held water. We built with what we had. Shelters of rust and brick, in an ever-shifting circle of huts and caravans. Inundated by pieces of forgotten tech, we took what we could to keep ourselves warm and safe. We salvaged what we could and used the rest for fuel or trading with the Offi of the mountain, the Secu of the tunnels, who still follow the old gods of insect and nuclear fire.
The old ones also protect our habs and domes. The old ones are ancient, stronger than steel and seemingly eternal. As a child I imagined that they were the same gods that cast us out, come in secret to help us find our way.
Our people come from the Engi sky-crafts; habs that touch the stars and daring highdecks to steal materials crucial to our survival. Without these crafts and their daring pilots, the Engi would not survive in these hostile stars.
The old ones live in the tunnels beneath us. They weave their metallic strands into the passages leading to our habs connecting the worlds we have been abandoned in. They are better than walls and mud; they quicken with hidden fire that keeps us safe.
We also work the metal, draining off it's magnetic hot-lines for our structures, seeing and repairing weak spots in their frames. We give the old ones food and offer prayers in their honor. We are, after all, our elder's children and the old ones our caretakers.
But now, something has changed. I can feel it in my bones. The old ones have become restless. They do not speak or ask for sacrifice, but their lights have grown brighter and more frequent. Something is coming and I fear I know not what.
The children were entranced as the elder continued to speak. He spoke of battles and courage, of victory and defeat. But he also spoke of courage still, and hope. That is why, when the lights went out, the Engi held fast. For the lights were not of our making, and we did not know what they meant.  Saluy paused, his calm voice left the assembled children in thoughtful silence. The only sound was a loud creaking coming from the large gantries which held the habs and domes in an eerie embrace. Suddenly, the creaking stopped and a voice screeched from the darkness: **Intruders detected! Activating security drones!**
Overhead, on the gantries and catwalks of the habitation dome, spinning red lights emerged from rusted shutters. Claxon warnings blared. A door, hidden by generations of rust and oxidation slid open along one wall and the drones- painted and decorated by generation after generation- slid forth.
The Engi gathered quickly, tucking small children away and hustling them to safety. Saluy motioned the several other adults to follow him and they hurried to the center of the dome where several large torches had been lit. He turned to the children huddled around him, wide-eyed and frightened. 'Listen to me. I have told you a story. The old ones, they are not monsters but men of honor, sent to keep us safe on our eternal journey. They come for us now, that is true, but the fear of them is unfounded. '
The Engi were on their feet in an instant, some gathering foodstuffs and weapons for the journey, others running to their quarters. Children were lifted up into safety in the arms of their mothers, old and wise.
The adults had rushed in, throwing aside the awnings and canvas as they selflessly prepared for the coming storm. Secu, ancient enemies of the Engi, had been sighted near the hab and the older ones knew the danger they posed.
The old ones wheeled about in some pre-known purpose heading toward the doors to which that had come a few moments before. There, they formed a line, ancient and silent and waiting.  Saluy, sensing something was wrong, leapt to his feet and grabbed his youngest child from the safety of his arms. He clambered around the room, gathering the rest of his children, and urged them all toward the door. As they approached, the old ones parted and held the door open for them.
The pods began their ascent, rising up through the ceiling of the dome, towards the stars.
Saluy shivered. Secu and Offi. Here? Somehow, he knew.
The old one that watched from the shadows spoke. **The Engi have a new home. We have been delivered here by a new form of reckoning. Prepare yourselves.**
The Old One's frame rocked slightly as if in acknowledgement, but it did not speak. It merely motioned Saluy forward and then lifted him in it's steel grip, carrying him towards a hidden doorway at the center of the vast dome.
'Old One! Answer me! I know you can speak!'. It said nothing and Saluy struggled with all his might. He'd seen Old Ones lift Secu, who were all warriors of terrible strength and incredible height, effortlessly from the ground and rip them limb from limb.
The doorway was pitch black and Saluy felt a terrible chill in his guts. The Old One approached the door with calm treads and stepped inside, still carrying Saluy. Once inside, the Old One chimed a series of notes. The door slid shut with a series of clanks and squeals and a light appeared over head. The room, once lit, held no terrors. The Old One set Saluy down and turned him gently until he was facing the wall beside the door.
On the wall was a control console with a large screen and a single chair. A star-shaped insignia was painted in black against the grey wall, and beneath it a series of faded characters in a language he'd never before seen.
The Old One approached the terminal and tapped a flickering light with its clawed right hand.
**This is a message from the gods. **
Saluy had experience with the old ways, and as the old one clacked and moved it's arms in weird patterns around him a thought occurred.  'Old one, are you talking about.. the gods?' He asked.  The Old One stiffened for a moment, as if surprised. Then, ever so slowly, it nodded.
He looked up, but the old one had left the room. No matter, he thought, this thing is just a terminal. I can manage this. He looked back at the glowing words and suddenly they made sense.
The terminal lit up.
A light flashed and Saluy felt something similar to a static shock that bit his wrist. He opened his eyes and the old one was holding a second wire harness and offering it to him.  Saluy took the wire, but his eyes still were still glued to the blinking terminal.  **Courses plotted. Trajectory calculations complete. Initiating jump.**  The walls began to shudder and Saluy screamed as he felt the ship lurching beneath his feet, the room around him darkening as the engines roared. He tried to stand, but found himself unable to move. The old one, still holding the wire harness, stepped back and then forward again, its lights flashing a steady rhythm.
The room disappeared and Suluy felt as if he were falling. The air pressure changed and pushed against him. He wanted to scream or struggle, but found he was suddenly and completely calm. He watched as the room shrunk into the smallest of dots and then disappeared and he was surrounded by a vast darkness he could not even begin imagine. He could feel the ship– no, *this was* the ship –moving, slowly at first and then faster and faster.
It was a queasy, sickening feeling. One moment, they were in the habitation dome, the lights twinkling and the stars of the Engi glowing brightly in the night sky. The next moment gravity seemed to reverse itself and they were pushing off the floor as the ship powered up its engines. The walls of the hab circled them and then dropped away until the were just sitting in the middle of a vast nothingness.
The Old One seemed to sense his unease and spoke again. **Passenger Sullivan, please prepare.**  Saluy, wide-eyed and speechless, stared at the Old One as it began to undress him. Off came the tunic, the trousers, the belt and boots. The old one bade him lie down in the chair and secured his arms and legs with buckles and straps. Saluy had no chance to resist even if he wanted to.
From above, Saluy might have seen hundreds of green and white pods, spilling forth the people of the Engi in a shower of humanity heading planetward. The planet was blue and white and the clouds were speckled with the gold of sunlight. It was a beautiful sight, but for Saluy and the other Engi, it was a portent of terror. For the first time, they were going home.  The old one turned to him and again, for the first time Saluy heard it speak. **You have been chosen. You must remain calm. ** Saluy felt the familiar chill run through his body once again. This was the moment for which his whole life had been preparing and yet his every instinct pulled him backwards, wishing he had stayed in the habs and domes, safe and ignorant of the fate that awaited him. He clamped down on his fear and, with a resigned and heavy heart, completed the ritual with which he had been charged. The old one pressed a vial to his arm and injected him with a substance. Saluy felt his consciousness blur and fade as his body relaxed against the chair, and the world around him began to swirl away.
Saluy looked at theOld One and managed a weak smile. It chirred and tilted it's head, then from it's chest came several clinks and whirrs as a portion of it's chest opened up and a length of cable and a small headset emerged. It reached up and secured the headset around Suluy's head, and a soft hum of a low voltage current travelled across his scalp.
**Initiate upload. ** Said the old one, voice a cool buzz.
**Upload initiated. **
The upload was instantaneous. Saluy immediately felt himself grow dizzy and the ship, which moments before had been silent, seemed to hum as if the dead computers of the ship had suddenly come alive. All around him, he thought he heard whispering, as if a thousand voices called to him all at once. His vision blurred and his mind raced.
Saluy felt like his mind was on fire. Information cascaded through his skull, like a river of blinding white light. He felt as if he was being pulled apart and put back together again. He could feel every single ship system come alive in his mind, like neurons and synapses connecting as he turned them on one after another. He felt the engines come alive, the reaction thrusters flaring to life and reversing the ships course. He could feel the billions of lines of code that controlled every movement of the ship, and as they began to run more smoothly under his control, he could feel the ship speeding up, moving faster than ever before through the void.
The old one stood behind him as hisbody jerked and shuddered, his teeth chattered and his eyes rolled in his head. Its clamp hands secured him to the chair as the ship settled into orbit and corrected the decay into the planets atmosphere. Below, the pods slashed through the planets clouds, trailing fire. Almost every one had functioning chutes and thrusters that came automatically online. Almost. Some were crushed against mountains before their chutes could open, or smashed into each other in the high air currents of the upper atmosphere. Saluy watched through the ships eyes as his people fell to their new home.
Saluy's mind linked directly with the ship's computer for only about 13 seconds, but in that time he learned everything it could teach him.
The ship, he learned, was a giant ark, intended to settle the outcasts on the strange planet below. The population was specially chosen, carefully selected for their knowledge, skills, and courage. Robots, provided by the same mysterious benefactors, were called Guardians and programmed to help the fledglings set up their new home. Saluy was learning it all, becoming engulfed in the sheer magnitude of data, when the old one broke his connection. The terminal screen faded and the headpiece was removed. Saluy rose slowly, feeling light but dizzy, and looked over the small desk at the old one. The light in its eyes faded to a dull orange, humming gently. Its duty was done.
'Gods above...' he muttered as his vision swam. 'Gods above, I; m glad I didn't know that was going to happen...'
As he wiped away the drool and looked up, the old one was pressing something into his hands. He looked down to see a bent piece of metal. He turned it over a few times and then recognized it. An old security drone, vintage 985, this one was someone's favorite, its metal body painted in bright colors and its eye sensors wiped clean. It had a hand written label that read: Davok's Blessing.
'Droid, what is your designation?'
**Designation X-5, Chief Engineer Sullivan. **
Suluy stepped away and began to survey the room. It was small, but he felt it was manageable. He rested the palm of his hand on the control panel and could feel the power necessary to keep the engines running, the life support and heating functioning, the habs powered- all within his direct command if need be.
**Acknowledged, Chief Engineer Sullivan. **
Saluy nodded, satisfied. He'd known it was a good decision to come. He'd just been afraid it would destroy him. He seemed to be fine.
'Very well. Let's go, we've got a lot of work to do and I want to start with seeing how many of the security droids we can have patrolling the ship within the day. The Secu, the Offi, they're still up here I'm betting and we need to neutralize them. Come. Let's begin. '
