'Who here has been in an aDAM attack?' I said, addressing the college audience. I was glad I was here, giving my account of the aDAM attacks. It was a good job; I sacrificed too damn much for this world, and it had given me little in return. Being a touring guest lecturer across the world was a dream come true.
Surprisingly, no one spoke or even moved. I looked around the auditorium, and only saw two kids at the back. They were a boy and a girl, and seemed to be talking about something. The boy had a wooden cane he was leaning on, and the girl had auburn hair and had her hands on her hips in an 'I-don't-give-a-damn' pose. It was strange, but I knew they were important in some way.
'Well, these two, evidently,' I said, gathering up my courage as I faced the two kids. The girl yawned, putting a hand in her auburn hair, and the guy snatched the cane off her, did a little jig, *and* pointed it at me. 'You'll be surprised, lady. I'm from Coleman Hill-you must've heard of the Cains from there, the veterans of the aDAM encounters!'
And then there was that moment of silence. After lowering my head for the smallest of tilts, I opened my eyes early to find those same two kids looking at me. The girl looked bored, and the guy looked like he was trying his hardest crack up silently. It looked like he was having a spasm.
'You. Girl with the auburn hair and guy with the cane. Get up here,' I demanded. The girl looked annoyed-did she have resting bitch face or something? -and elbowed the guy, who couldn't hold it in anymore and burst out laughing. The rest of the auditorium was quiet as the duo made their way forwards. It made the cane's impacts with the floor that much louder.
'You two are also U.N. soldiers, aren't you? Cains?'
'Eh? Yeah, how did you know?' the girl said, looking surprised.
'The mark of Cain. I saw it when you guys stood up. You should never boast so shamelessly, especially when there are former U.N. soldiers present.'
'Well, duh, we're students in a college auditorium...'
'Don't give me that attitude,' I snarled. I wanted to slap her face. In fact, the guy's too. He gave up standing and was rolling around on the floor.
I put an arm proudly on my black uniform. 'I am a U.N. soldier, part of the 82nd generation. I have fought in the previous 12th aDAM Encounter, when the aDAMs decimated Paris and terrorized everyone in France. I was pinned to the ground for hours when the level of the Gravity Field surpassed everybody's expectations. Do you know how hard it is to be helpless, unable to move? I only survived because I drank the rainwater that sipped into my mouth. I couldn't do anything as the aDAMs stepped onto my fellow soldiers and brothers. And you, *you* have the gall to pretend to be U.N. soldiers? !? You have not been in my situation! Have you been bragging to your friends that you're one of the lucky few to be Cains, defenders of humanity? Don't make me laugh. You're sad, pitiful, human beings.'
The girl looked embarrassed, and the guy stopped his incessant giggling. I made sure to scan the auditorium, letting my gaze land upon student after student.
Then the guy finally began to speak. 'Please dude, stop speaking. You're embarrassing us. A true Cain never talks about past aDAM Encounters they've been in. They're too traumatizing.'
The girl stopped laughing. 'Yeah, what's
'Wow, how did you guess?' the guy said, raising his eyebrows.
'I think mine's in the laundry,' the girl said. She had a pinky in her ear, digging around for some earwax or something. Again, it made me want to tear their heads off. 'Who's dead body did you get yours from?'
The girl and the guy were both coughing up laughter now. I had no choice but to be a *real* man now and show these ignorant kids who's boss.
'Arm wrestle contest?' they both said simultaneously. Then they both began laughing again.
I replied nothing, just stared them down softly, and patted the ground in front of me. They looked at each other, and then finally nodded.
'Sure. Jenn, you got this,' the guy said. The girl sighed, but also laid down.
So started the arm wrestle. At first it was slow, but then it began to go faster. Both of us were yearning for victory, trying to overpower the other. For a while, I thought I was going to win, but I was losing my strength quickly. I had fought in the last aDAM Encounter, and it had been unnecessary. To think I had risked my life for nothing! It made me mad at the Cains, who were supposedly saving humanity. To make matters worse, they weren't making a scratch in the ongoing aDAM war. And even though their numbers were small, they were among the most resourced people on Earth!
In the end, the Cains managed to fight back, but I was too late. I just wanted revenge- but the feeling of helplessness had clouded my judgment.  And so here I was, challenging two kids to an arm wrestling contest. Two kids who were actually Cains. As I began explaining the rules, I noticed something strange. Those two were strangely prepared; the girl had some sort of contraption strapped to her arm, and the guy had a robotically enhanced cane.
'Alright, so who goes first?' the girl -Jenn- said, already laying down. I looked around, feeling cornered. My only option was to extend my robotic arm and pray.
'Ready?' she said, and at that moment, I knew I was fucked. A split second later, bolts and screws were flying around everywhere, electricity spewing from splayed wires as I stared in shock.
'God, you're such a dumb dude if you didn't think the U.N. was watching you,' the guy said, yawning. 'Please. H.Q. wanted to expose you directly with a public announcement, but we Cains convinced them that we wanted to have some fun. Mannnn it was hilarious seeing you'beat' Cains in arm-wrestling contests who pretended to try their hardest. Shame Jenn here was getting too pissed off.'
