Bill slammed the empty shotglass upside down on the counter. 'Seriously! They never talk about how much... Ummm... Paperwork! Yeah! And shouting! They never mention that in the pamphlet!' He reached over the floating counter top and grabbed another green bag from the shelf. After uncapping the top, the liquid slowly slid out and splashed into another shotglass in his hand. The counter bobbed down slowly as Bob dropped the bag on it. 'I signed up to go see the sights and meet new cultures! Not to get stuck in an office signing contracts and making ads! Paper after paper after- ugh- paper... Meeting the president even gets boring after the 20th time! So many questions that we had answered in our report months ago! You never realize how much people don't read until you do something abnormal. They always want to ask the same question but hear the answer from you!'
Bob started to laugh uncontrollably. 'Dang!' he sputtered, 'it sounds like you got a real bad deal! And a horrible experience being the 'Test Subject' of the Alliance! But you did get to be the president and have all the limelight to yourself! It was hard to miss that on the news!'  'Ha!' Bill said, 'yeah, it was great! I mean, they were gonna put me in a- ugh- museum and make me talk to the press! I don't really talk to anyone there anyway, so that was a plus.'  He slammed the shotglass and pushed the empty bag back to Bob. 'It really sucks that I had to go through all of that though. At least they made the accommodations really nice and made sure to pay me well. But still!' Bill said, his eyes wandering off to the neon sign behind Bob. 'I mean, why the heck did they have to pick me for this? I'm just some random traveler who wanted to explore the universe a bit.'
'Ah yes- I have experienced similar issues back on Earth. It seems that no matter where we go, bureaucracy follows. It's like the tide coming in and out. We just have to brave the waves until the storm passes.'
Bob's eyes lit up and- ignoring the gravity problems- leapt up and excitedly snatched the bottle. His pulsating red skin glowed as he brought it to his lips and guzzled the contents down.  'Oh yeah! This is the best!' He belched out a few more clicking noises in the bar's holographic atmosphere and slammed the bottle back onto the counter with a satisfied smirk. He wiped the edge of his mouth and pointed to Bill with a pudgy finger. 'I don't understand,' he said in a slightly lower than usual tone, 'how you humans can tolerate the gravity of this planet. You do ridiculous stuff with style.'
'Oh yeah, definitely. Just wait until they legalize cross-species marriage! Your gravity is so much worse. You can do crazy things here. I can't imagine doing it with a girl so heavy and so slowly... Ummm... What was I- Oh right! What I don't understand is how- ugh- you're drinking me under the table so easily!'
'Probably that dang gravity again. Alcohol just floods in and out on Earth. Here, the alcohol chills in your blood for such a long time! Your kidneys barely have the work and the good times last so much longer! Which reminds me: Here is another shot!'
