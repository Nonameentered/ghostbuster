You just got fired, you're pretty sure your girlfriend is cheating on you, you're 75k in student loans debt, rent was due last week, and to top it all off? You're all out of beer. Oddly enough, you just got an email titled 'Would you like to change the difficulty? Current setting: Very Hard.'
There once was a man from Nantucket. Well, he wasn't really, but fuck it. One normal day, in the middle of May, he heard a ring from his pocket. 

From his pocket to his hand, the phone still rang with sweet, light-hearted tone. It wasn't a call. 'A message to all beta testers' was what the screen shone. 

He thought, 'An email from Eden Corp? I wonder what the hell this is for. Change the difficulty? Is this thing goddamn faulty?' A list of numbers shone 1 to 4. 

There's no such thing. This must be a prank. But whatever, no hair off my flank. He pressed a button, and became a sultan. Before his eyes, servants came in ranks. 

He celebrated without a care, though he should really be scared. Murricans are coming for carpet bombing; he didn't hit easy, but 'nightmare'!
