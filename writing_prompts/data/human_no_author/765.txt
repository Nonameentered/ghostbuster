[ You stay out too late] (https: //www.youtube.com/watch? v=nfWlot6h_JM) 
got the Joker on your brain 
That's what people say 
mmhm 
that's what people say 
mmhm 
& nbsp; 
You're the hero that we need 
but not the hero that we want 
At least 
that's what people say 
mmhm 
that's what people say 
mmhm 
& nbsp; 
But you keep brooding 
can't stop, won't stop 
stewing 
It's like you got this hole down in your heart 
and it's not gon na be alright 
& nbsp; 
'Cause the Joker won't play fair, fair, fair, fair, fair, 
And the Scarecrow's gon na scare, scare, scare, scare, scare 
Baby you're just gon na glare, glare, glare, glare, glare 
You can't bear it all, bear it all 
Bane is your nightmare, -mare, -mare, -mare, -mare 
And the city doesn't care, care, care, care, care 
Baby you're just gon na glare, glare, glare, glare, glare 
You can't bear it all, bear it all 
& nbsp; 
You always walk your beat 
You're like lightning on your feet 
And that's what they don't see 
mmhm 
that's what they don't see 
mmhm 
& nbsp; 
You're swinging on your own 
( swinging on your own) 
You make the moves up as you go 
( moves up as you go) 
And that's what they don't know 
mmhm 
That's what they don't know 
mmhm 
& nbsp; 
'Cause the Joker won't play fair, fair, fair, fair, fair, 
And the Scarecrow's gon na scare, scare, scare, scare, scare 
Baby you're just gon na glare, glare, glare, glare, glare 
I can't bear it all, bear it all 
Bane is your nightmare, -mare, -mare, -mare, -mare 
And the city doesn't care, care, care, care, care 
Baby you're just gon na glare, glare, glare, glare, glare 
& nbsp; 
I can't bear it all, 
bear it all 

Goodbye, Bruce.
