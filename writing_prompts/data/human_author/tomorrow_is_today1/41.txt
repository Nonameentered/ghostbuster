Love this poem! What an ending!

I think you captured the feel of the picture very well, and took it further where you added meaning and backstory.

You did a great job with the flow and rhythm of this poem. Like in that first section, you managed to have lines of equal length while still having variation in sentence patterns to keep it from getting repetitive or monotone. Then of course you changed the structure for the second section, which I think actually worked quite well. It fit the urgency of the moment very well, as opposed to the sentimentality of the beginning.

One particular detail I also liked was the parallel structure in "A land of lore, fable, and myth is now one of death, decay, and ruin."
