# Recipe for the Black Sea

Call it nature, call it nurture, you are free to question why you have been led to this place. Perhaps it is genetic, a family history, whether recorded and diagnosed or not. Perhaps it was unlocked by environment, by neglect or trauma. You can spend eternity trying to unlock the secrets of your own past. It won’t help you leave. Are you prepared to stay here?

The bowl in which you find yourself and your ingredients is a canyon of shadows. It stretches out in an optical illusion so that it looks impossibly large, walls so menacing the thought of trying to climb them makes you exhausted. Still, many people try. Some even succeed. Will you?

The canyon has a way of isolating people. You’re in a whole other world, impossibly large and impossibly dark. Who would join you here?

The first ingredient added is fog. It fades in and out at different times of day, and at its strongest will envelop you completely, leaving you shivering cold no matter the season. It numbs your skin and condenses on your clothes, adding weight to your shoulders and your chest. The thick moisture of the air makes it difficult to breathe, and every time you inhale you wonder how long it will take before you drown.

Put a pin in that, we’ll return to drowning later.

The second ingredient is ghosts. They call to you. Can you hear them? They whisper in the voices of people you know, people you care about, sometimes even you. What are they saying about you? Are they laughing at you? They know you’re different, you’re not one of them.

Some argue that ghosts are not a required ingredient, and instead are their own separate meal. Enough have the two together that I’ve listed them here, but remember to take my words with a grain of salt. There is a ghost that sounds like me too.

The third ingredient is tangible darkness. It is warm and heavy and thick, and envelopes you like a weighted blanket. If the level rises above your head, you will want to swim to the surface and tread water, for otherwise it will drown you. There’s that pin.

Finding something that floats is vital. You cannot tread water forever. Some suggestions include images, loved ones, words of people who have eaten the same meal and survived, any reassurance you can find. If you cannot find any object to cling to, external support may be required to keep you from sinking.

You may find yourself enamored by the darkness, compelled by it. You might want to swim beneath the surface, believing it to be beautiful. This is dangerous. Proceed with caution. Remember not to listen to the ghosts, no matter how much they sound like you, and remember that the black sea is not a part of you. Sometimes external support may be required. Do seek it.

From one chef to another, swimming in my own sea, best of luck out there.
