I do a lot of similar stuff in my own writing! Characters are definitely the focus (and like all my main characters are trans lol). Fantasy is so fun to explore, and it can be really cool to craft elements of the environment and setting around how they affect the characters. Pretty much all of my descriptions are through characters' eyes, focusing on what sticks out to them. I really enjoy it.

I wrote in my comment that one of the themes I go back to a lot is oppression. How my characters make it in a world that feels like it doesn't want them, whether they be directly on the run from people trying to kill them or whether they simply be abandoned by the government, left to rot in abusive situations or something. I definitely have that heaviness and tragedy in most of what I write.

I also have a lot of found family in my stories.
