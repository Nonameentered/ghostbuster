He turned left at the clock and began down the hall toward the door at the end. On the other side of a window in the door he could see it waiting for him.

As he approached, its eyes followed him down the corridor.

*Returning so soon?*

He looked through the window in the door. “You haven’t changed much, have you?”

*Neither have you*. The eyes blinked. They were so bright, he couldn’t look at them directly. They shone fuzzily, reflecting light sideways in his vision. He reached for the door handle and opened the door inward. The room was so dark. He needed rest. His eyes needed rest. He shook.

*If you’ve come here for an escape, you will be disappointed. We don’t offer those services in summer*. The scratchy voice laughed, a hollow sound.

“Why did you say back so soon? It’s been years."

*You know it’s always soon with me. Or did you forget that time passes differently here?*

The figure reached out and clasped his right hand. *Ah, you brought a watch again. Silly boy. Thinking you can keep track all on your own, in the place without sunshine.*

“Just quit it, alright? Just let me in.”

*Funny to ask me to quit it now, when you’re entering my room. My domain. You know I won’t quit there.*

He shook, but didn’t respond. He turned around and looked at the clock on the far wall, trying to piece together how many minutes had passed since he arrived. Maybe he could go back. Maybe it wasn’t too late.

The figure grabbed him and pulled him into darkness, the door shutting as he began to fall. *No looking back, my dear. You’re mine now.*

Hollow laughter filled his ears as he watched the window on the door grow further and further away, the creature spinning him until he lost all direction.

He was back in limbo.
