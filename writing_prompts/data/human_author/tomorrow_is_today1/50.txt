I do not know how I got here  
But I have a strong memory of fear  
and it’s gnawing at me, *move, go*  
while all my movements feel too slow  
and the fog in front of me won’t clear.

At once I watch a hall appear  
and feel myself move into here  
where cracks underneath a line of doors glow  
but where they lead, I do not know.

I tug a handle, but something queer -  
the door’s sound echoes in my ear  
I lean in, and what does it show  
but from behind, my own torso  
I’m back where I started, or somewhere near  
I do not know how I got here.  


Putting the origin out of my mind,  
I leave the door open, hoping I’ll find  
whichever one will take me away  
I know there’s got to be a way  
to return to the world that shined

Running, I forget what’s behind  
and what’s forward, as the hall’s lined  
endlessly with doors and floor and grey  
Am I just out of my mind?

A part of me is so inclined  
to give up here and stay confined  
But I won’t give up, won’t falter, won’t sway  
No matter how endlessly long this day  
I will get myself out of this bind  
even while feeling out of my mind.  


I run and run between each door  
Scanning for hints on the walls and the floor  
Memories haunt my brain like clues  
evening light filling my room with blues  
strange shapes reflecting off of my clothes drawer

If I can remember, can know what tore  
me from my life and what it was for,  
Will I know the way and not be confused?  
I run and run.

I search my brain for anything more  
to get me out of here, help me restore  
my life to what it was, so I don’t lose  
everything. What can I possibly use  
to escape? I already feel sore  
running and running between each door.
