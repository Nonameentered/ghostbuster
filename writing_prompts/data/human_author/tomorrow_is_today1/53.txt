“Dude. Calm the hell down. Did its meow sound like the word meow? Yes! That’s a normal fucking thing you dunce! We are not in a TV show where anything you perceive to be maybe strange must mean it’s supernatural and you’re gonna save the world by pointing it out. You’re screaming at me in my own home over a fucking meow. I literally read a post last week from someone that trained their cat to meow the word hello, and I heard somewhere that even with normal meows cats imitate their owner’s voice. So shut your loud ass mouth.”
