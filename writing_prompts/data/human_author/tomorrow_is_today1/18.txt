Death is in the air.

It lives alongside us, taking people slow and quick - always there, waiting, watching. The idea of a guaranteed lifespan is a laugh. Death can and will come at any time.

Look around the room. How many people are there? Is it just you? A few family members, friends, coworkers, classmates? A crowd of people. Note their faces.

Anyone in that room might die today.

Even you. Even everyone. Each moment alive, each ticking of the clock is a stroke of chance, a heart beating, a sparrow singing, *alive*, *alive*—until you’re not.

Perhaps death is absurd, as incomprehensible as you seem to view it. But I ask you, then, is life comprehensible? Is not your very existence as absurd as its inevitable transition into death’s veil?

Look around you. You are living upon death’s creation. The foods you eat, the places you walk, the plants you smile at when you go on a walk, all this is built upon death. Death breeds creation.

It is the way things are in this cyclical life of ours.
