The blanket is soft against my bare legs as I curl up and press the couch lever that makes it swing out and give my legs more room. After having a headache most of the day, it’s nice to feel so cozy.

“I got the banana bread and tea for you!” Rose said as she carried over our plates and cups and set them on the flat surface between us before snuggling into her own couch section. I reached a hand over to trace the top of her back, and she smiled. She took the remote and switched on the TV, changing the settings to display whatever spooky movie she chose for the night. Usually something Tim Burton. I definitely didn’t mind.

The banana bread was warm and soft, and I could feel the sweet tea fall down my throat and warm me up from the inside. Though the movie was playing, I laid my head on the pillow behind me and curled into a ball facing Rose. She smiled at me and pulled my blanket up over my shoulders.

“Still got that headache?” She asked.

I shrugged. “Maybe just tired.”

She nodded, and turned off the lights as the movie began to play. I just laid there, facing her, as I drifted off to sleep.
