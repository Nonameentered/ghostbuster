“Hey, what happened to your kid’s parents? I haven’t been seeing them around when you follow the kid.”

“Oh, I killed them.”

“What?!” I stared at him incredulously. The demon-turned-guardian angel just shrugged.

“They were hurting her, so I killed them. My job *is* to protect this kid, right? Then I made the right call.”

I huffed. “We have a strict policy on abuse, and it does *not* allow for killing anyone. My Lord, I knew this demon rehabilitation program was a bad idea. I’ll have to fill out the forms, and perform the hearing, find a replacement…”

“That sounds like a policy problem to me,” the demon said. I glared at him.

He sighed. “Listen,” he said. “I get that you live up here in heaven with all the goody goody two shoes who were lucky enough to turn out alright or unlucky enough to die before they grew jaded. But in my domain, I see everyone you’ve failed. And you know how many people are in there because of abuse? It’s cyclical. You allow the parents to abuse the children, the children don’t grow up right, more abuse follows. It’s your policy that lets this happen.”

“Well, you can’t just kill people!”

He shrugged again. “I dunno about that. Sometimes, people just gotta go. Your God up here can judge them when they’re gone, I’m not trying to take His place, goodness no. But I am doing my job properly. It’s astounding how many kids you guardian angels have failed because you couldn’t do anything to really protect them.”
