*I sit atop puffs of purple and white*  
*A world of clouds surrounding me*  
*there is a pond of fog my feet dip into*  
*and it feels light and cold.*

Our protest is small and quiet so far  
but just wait a while longer.  
My friend’s arrived and carries a sign  
and we laugh and hug each other.

&#x200B;

*I reach my hand into the pond*  
*watch the fog swirl beneath my fingertips*  
*I lean more and more forward*  
*and suddenly I’m falling in.*

I check my watch another time.  
Weren’t more people going to show up?  
I exchange glances with my friend  
and it looks like she feels the same.

&#x200B;

*As I fall deeper into the pond*  
*the air is dark and damp and thick*  
*and claws reach out to brush my skin*  
*with glowing eyes and toothy grins.*

A crowd of strangers walks by us  
They reach for my friend’s sign.  
They mock and spit and laugh  
and I hold my breath for them to pass by.

&#x200B;

*I see colored lights in all this dark*  
*veins of yellow and green*  
*I push away the claws and swim*  
*toward these liquid trees.*

The crowd has left, but we’re on edge  
and my friend grabs her phone.  
She hands her sign to me  
and she begins to make a call.

&#x200B;

*I enter the lime green liquid vein*  
*and feel it pull me upward.*  
*It’s filled with light and smells of wind*  
*and I smile and float and spin.*

To make our protest seem less small,  
we create a rhythm and a call  
And as my friend puts down her phone  
more cars pull up and park.

&#x200B;

*The vein releases me into the air*  
*and I fly up into the sky*  
*all around me are puffy clouds*  
*of pink and blue and shining white.*

The cars open up and emerge more people  
friends of my friend, apparently  
we give them signs and teach them our call  
and we stomp and chant and feel less small.
