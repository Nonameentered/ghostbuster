I find us slipping our opinions into our work  
clinging to the mindsets that define our existence as we analyze a novel  
seeing ourselves in its magical realism  
wishing to tell that this is what that means  
but we dip away a little bit and talk about joy.

The funny thing is that it goes both ways  
from the moment we wrote up that clause in our thesis  
that to find joy one must embrace the absurd  
we’ve seen it in our thoughts  
felt it in our hopes  
found it in our imaginings of a yet-unknown future.

If I look back I can see we’ve been doing this since forever, now  
creative writing assignments where our characters reflected us  
advocating for ourselves in discussions with a false ‘they’  
as if the people we were discussing were some other  
as if we were not who we are.

We want to sway opinion with the safety of an outsider  
to work slowly and carefully as educators  
not have the pressure to defend ourselves  
our own existence  
in doubt.

Maybe someday we will move these ribbons  
allow outsiders to see a truer picture  
it will never be safe to do so -  
but maybe  
someday  
it will be worth it.
