I once did an exercise for myself because I hadn't been reading or writing as much at the time where I pulled out a book I really like to reread and wrote a short piece in my notebook after each chapter. Though after a while I ended up forgetting to and just read a bunch of chapters, but by that time I'd already written a few things. I wonder if I should do that again.
