You wish you would stand up for yourself

as you watch him knock books off your shelf

&#x200B;

In a corner, small, frozen, quiet, and still

After all this time, you have no will

&#x200B;

to fight it. And he does the same

to your siblings, feeling no remorse or shame

&#x200B;

as you watch them frozen, quiet, small

cowering, never standing tall

&#x200B;

and as he yells you exchange a glance

wanting to ask for help, each knowing, *not a chance*.
