Damn. What a wonderful Petrarchan sonnet. I love where you took this from the prompt, and I think the poetic form you chose fits the theme of the poem very well.

I really appreciated the imagery in the first stanza and felt it helped to ground the poem and give the reader something to visualize, to make it feel more real. I think having the poem start off that way and then slip into the more abstract works very well.

The rhythm and flow of the poem is very nice. It isn't perfect iambic pentameter, but it still fits the form pretty well and sounds great while reading.

My favorite stanza is the first; I think it's really strong, and I like that it gives the reader an image to connect the emotions with. It's hard to say if this is with the poem or just me, but I had a bit of a harder time at the very end and had to reread to catch the meaning of a couple of the lines ("Into our existence, life's fare thee well" and after). I wonder if maybe there's a stronger way you could get across the same ideas and end off the poem. I also get that it's constrained by the form though.

Anyway, good job, love your poem!
