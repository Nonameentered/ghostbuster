Nothing exists except for the piano.

At least, not on the surface. I hone in on the sheet music of the next sonatina, ignoring the grace notes and volume markers as I stumble my fingers across the keys. I think it’s impossible for me to play a full song without messing up at least once. I’m messing up a lot more than once right now, anyway.

My brother in the other room must have a headache, because he keeps making noises. Squealing or grunting or singing random, unconnected notes. They don’t sound much worse than this sonatina, to be honest. Maybe it sounds better if a better player plays it. I turn the page.

I have to get better. I have to fix these clumsy fingers and learn to play properly, dammit. What kind of piano player am I if I keep messing up? I’ll never play anything that sounds good. I’ll definitely never write music at this rate.

I never said stuff like that to my piano teacher. She always wanted me to have fun with my playing, giving me books full of old love songs from the seventies that she thought were beautiful. It wasn’t the type of music I listened to, but she made me see its beauty.

Piano is all I have left of her.

I have to get better.
