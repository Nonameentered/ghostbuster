What ghost story will be told today, to another unknowing victim?

First our accomplice opens her mouth, excited to tell an altered truth:  
that a monster lurks within these very woods  
and it steals the face of someone you once loved  
and it lures you into the trees  
and impales you like a marshmallow to roast over a fire.

Our monster herself, she makes a correction:  
that the monster doesn’t steal the face of someone you loved  
but it lives inside them, a parasite in their mind  
so to die is to be betrayed by that very one.  
Your body is too large for a human to hold over a fire,  
so they break you up into pieces  
and roast each one for so long  
that they become bubbly and black and burnt.

Our victim would like to enter, now -  
knowing yet not knowing the stories are built on truth -  
saying:  
perhaps the monster lives inside more than one person  
and it puppets many together, like a hive mind or a collection of mushrooms  
and the monster itself cannot be killed  
but you can sever the connection between it and your loved one.

Our monster herself, she disagrees, of course.  
That connection cannot be severed!  
(for it was not severed for her.  
but she might not know she’s the monster after all -  
doesn’t everyone think they’re the main character?)

And all while they’re talking, the flame between them flickers  
aching to devour its next fleshy meal  
to grow from campfire to bonfire  
celebrating the kill.

Our victim’s last words are begging her monster to be human.  
Our monster’s last words to her are seething with blame.

How curious it would be to be the accomplice,  
watching it all in the light of the flame.
