“*Back and forth,*  
*back and forth,*  
*we are swinging back and forth.*  
*Back and forth,*  
*back and forth,*  
*we are swinging back and forth!*”

Ellie giggled as her Momma pushed her on the swing. The song was so pretty.

“Back and forth!” Ellie said.

“Yes, sweetie, you’re swinging back and forth.”

“You swinging?”

Momma laughed. “I’m pushing you right now.”

Ellie paused. “Is pushing fun? Like swinging?”

“It is fun, Ellie. I get to spend time with you, and that’s always fun.”

Ellie kicked her legs out the holes in the swing. The air blowing by felt like wind, but it didn’t feel that way before Momma pushed her. It was only windy when she was swinging.

“I flying!” Ellie said, and clapped her hands. “Momma?”

“Yes, dear?”

“Is it always windy for birds since they fly all the time?”

“Maybe when they’re higher up in the sky. But birds are used to the wind. They know how to fly in it no matter which way it’s blowing.”

Ellie clapped her hands again. The swing creaked every time she went forward. She could feel it in the seat and she could hear it. Both!

“Momma?” Ellie asked. “Can you sing again?”
