“Howdy, folks,” a painter said with a wave. “Why don’t you come take a seat? Find some friends. We got plenty of room for more here, always.”

Gregor and Ryan left the car and walked onto the hill. It looked like a small party, or Ryan’s memories of creative writing classes and open mic nights. Beyond the hill the rainbow shone bright in the sky, and on the ground it inspired a variety of paintings, outfits, even a few people with prisms and something called a diffraction grating making patterns with the light onto a screen.

While some people were standing, the hill was covered in folding chairs, and Ryan sat in one while Gregor walked back to the car to bring snacks. He wasn’t the only one who’d had the idea, apparently - there was a table set out with cookies and punch.

“Hey, what’s your name?”

Ryan turned to see a tall lady with braids and a pastel pink & blue color scheme taking the seat by him, on the opposite side of where Gregor was going to sit.

“I’m Luna. She/they.”

“Ryan. He/him. What is this, by the way? Other than the end of the rainbow.”

Luna laughed. “That oughta be the name for this gathering, huh? You’re not even the first to come out here searching for it and find us. But we heard the city wasn’t doing a pride parade this year and so we wanted to organize a little thing here on our own, where people can maybe celebrate quietly and be safe. So we came out here, called a few more people, and then more just kept coming.”

“Wow. It’s like we’re drawn to each other.”

“Right?”

Gregor sat down and gave them each a cup of punch.
