Norman took Dori’s elbow and they walked together, following signs from behind lampposts, buildings, windows.

“So,” Dori said. “You didn’t tell me you were of the shadows.”

“Did my arrival not say enough? I walked out of one when we first met.”

She laughed, and Norman looked over to see the yellow rings in the center of her eyes growing. “I didn’t even notice. Maybe I see too well.”

They walked a while longer, each watching each other to see what changes the night would bring. They seemed almost opposite in some ways - as Norman grew less and less visible, blending in with the road and only visible by a faint glimmer of moonlight, Dori’s dress sparkled and her eyes glowed brighter. A Walker and an Owl, side by side. Each Steen grinning wide.

Dori turned toward the space behind a building and hooted three times. Three times back she heard.

Dori and Norman glanced at each other, paused a moment, then together walked straight into the darkness.
