Good words, Haru! Loved your piece. The dialogue really carries it along.. And of course you had to make it emotional at the end ðŸ˜­

One thing I think editing could really improve is tenses. This is evident in a few places where you switch between past and present, like "I wanted to celebrate Thanksgiving with my mom ... I want to make things right." You also use "would" in a few places, like "I would walk to the front door and open it" and "I would notice that I was alone", and I think the sentences would (ha) be better without it. The would kinda makes it seem uncertain, like this is something the character isn't actually doing but thinking about doing.

I'd also love to have more context into this character's life and what they're going through with their mom. We get a good sense of how they're feeling that day, but I'd like to have a little bit more into maybe why or how long it's been like this for them. Not a requirement (and I know wordcount is limited), but you got me interested.

Overall, awesome job! These snapshots throughout the day work well I think in developing the story and packing a punch. Good words!
