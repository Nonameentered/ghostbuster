I dunno if this'll help you, but writing for the features has been nice for me since I often don't find prompts I like otherwise. I think it depends on what kind of prompt you like though - I really like TT, for instance, because I'm a huge fan of vague prompts with a lot of creative freedom.

You can also sort by a certain type of prompt, like IP (image prompt), SP (simple prompt), or RF (reality fiction).
