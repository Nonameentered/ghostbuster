Damn. I love this poem. I think you used the envelope / repeated part of the structure very well! The theme of the piece matches the structure, which I appreciate.

I think the poem has a nice rhythm to it. The rhyme and the consistency of the lines helps it flow well.

Mostly what I love about the poem is how well you expressed these two very different relationships and the feelings associated. You take these experiences I've had and put them into words. Plus I love the contrast between the two people.

Most of your lines are worded very well, so it's hard to find a bit to criticize. I was confused by "you put suffering scaffolding in" - maybe I just don't get it, but I'm not sure what exactly that means. And I noticed that a few of the lines, like "...the wonderful" didn't rhyme like the others did, and I wonder if maybe that could be tweaked to better follow the rest of the piece.

Overall, great job, love your poem!
