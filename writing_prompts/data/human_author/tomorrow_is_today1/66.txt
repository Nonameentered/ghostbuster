When today was ‘tomorrow’  
I thought I knew what it would hold.  
I really believed I could predict every step of the way,  
from the time I come awake  
to the sunrise signaling my return to bed.

Well, sunrise has come, and I’m awake.

I was so used to the time slurring together  
weeks indistinguishable from each other  
that I was convinced each day would be exactly the same.  
I was wrong.

Ha!

I was wrong!

How beautiful it feels to abandon that old anthem  
‘tomorrow is today’  
and allow each day to be new again,  
full of beauty and horror -  
full of  
*opportunity*.
