How easily we become what we once hated  
As soon as we are the recipient of a little bit of luck.

How quickly you abandon everything you fought for!  
How quickly you join the oppressors!  
How baked into our brains it is -  
must be, for this switch to be possible -  
that the only success we should desire is success within the system.

You fought the system not out of desire but necessity,  
Not because you didn’t want to follow it but because you couldn’t,  
And in your desperation  
For safety  
For validity  
For *approval*  
You allow yourself to become a token  
Knowing that if you keep fighting  
Then your one chance,  
one grasp at this elusive privilege  
will be stolen away again  
as you are ground into the dirt  
and told to be grateful that your body feeds the fungi.

Perhaps you are better off now.  
Perhaps not.  
But even alive,  
your body is still feeding the fungi  
the weeds  
the enemy  
As you watch yourself morph into little more  
than an object of theirs.

You lost your dignity  
and, too,  
your people.
