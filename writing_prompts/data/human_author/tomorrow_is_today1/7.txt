I love the line "This is not how you get wants that you "need."" so much!

This poem's got really fun rhythm. I love how it changes it up like with the shorter lines while still staying rhythmic throughout both with the lines (esp. longer ones) themselves and with the rhyme at the end that kind of helps give it structure.

I thought the story of the poem developed well throughout, and ended well on "tonight I finally sleep".

I was a bit confused by the last three lines of the first stanza, I wasn't sure exactly what they were referring to. I think the rest of the poem is clear, it's just those few I'm confused on.

Anyhow, great poem!
