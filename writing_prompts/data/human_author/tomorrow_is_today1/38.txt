The hours passed, the night and day indistinguishable under the same flickering lamplight as he worked. He was absorbed in his art, pausing only to wash hands, take a sip of water, use the bathroom, and begin again. He did not know how long it had been.

He could not leave.

He splashed water on his face and began again.

A fear began to make itself known in his mind that his work would be interrupted. Others would find him and call him mad and destroy his work. His precious work. This creature. He must keep it hidden, keep it safe. He was the only one who could accomplish this. The only one!

Was that a banging on the door? But nobody’s there. Is someone waiting, watching, biding their time to come in and destroy this creature forever?

All at once, the worries stopped. He looked back at his creature.
