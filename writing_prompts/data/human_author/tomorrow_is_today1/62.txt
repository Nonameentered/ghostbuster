I smiled up at the morning sky as I walked along the sidewalk toward the glass conservatory. A few birds hopped along the road or in the grass. It was too early for the trees to cast any spotted shadows with their leaves, so the ground around them was just a slightly darker shade within the cool tones that engulfed the sleeping town.

I grinned and shifted my gardening bag from one hand to the other, raising the first to push a lock of hair out of my face. What a beautiful time to be awake.

While the conservatory doors did have a lock, and I carried the key around with me, they were typically left open for free use, and today was no different.

I set straight to work, moving, as always, from top to bottom. Yesterday brought rain, so I left my watering can at home. Setting my bag down on a stone bench, I started with trims. Snip a branch here, another there. Keep the trees and plants all nice and pretty, give everything a little more room to breathe.

The garden breathed its sweet, spring air, and golden light began to creep in. I had no thoughts or words to express the beauty, so I picked up another tool and continued to work.

At each spot in the garden I took time to get to know the plants I was tending to. I felt that soft, almost rubbery touch of the petals of blooming flowers, the gentle roughness of some of their harsher leaves. Wherever I found weeds, I knelt down, not bothering with gloves, and felt the earth around them. I judged the thickness of the weed’s stem, the resistance I would face. Then, carefully, I pulled up each weed, root and all. It felt nice to remove them from the ground, like I was freeing the space for something new.

The light shone brighter now, and the blue sky showed new streaks of white and orange surrounding the sun. A thin layer of dried dirt caked my hands, and I reached up my elbows to push back the hair that kept falling in my face. I peeked under a few wide stones in their path along the ground to check for the insects, the roly polys and the worms that made this conservatory their home. A few roly polys crawled onto my arms. I smiled.

As I made my way around, checking over each plant a final time, I found a black journal lying under one of the stone benches. Rubbing my hands together to get rid of some of the dirt, I carefully picked it up and brushed off the cover. I looked over the front and back for anything that might tell me who the journal belonged to. Nothing on the covers. Maybe there would be information inside.

As I opened it up to the inside front cover, a few of the pages fluttered open and I got a glimpse of their contents - each a drawing of one of the plants in the conservatory.

I looked through a couple of the pages, intrigued. Whoever it was, this person was a great artist. I longed to fill the empty space beside the drawings with notes about each plant, when they grow, how to take care of them. Would this person add the notes themself, I wondered, if they knew what to write?

The inside of the front cover gave a first name - James - but nothing else. Fearing the notebook would get rained on or someone else might mistakenly take it, I placed it in my bag, pulling out a few plant markers and a pen. I wrote for James to visit in either the morning or evening on any day it wasn’t storming to come pick up his journal from me, the plant caretaker.

Leaving the note on the stone bench I’d found James’s journal under, I walked out into the morning light, imagining all the notes I’d write if that journal were mine.

\*\*\*

The air sat pink and heavy over the emptying streets, the yellow heat of the day giving way to the evening’s gentle warmth. The birds and squirrels hustled off to their sleeping places as James sat alone on a cool stone bench, flicking a pencil between his fingers and watching as the shadows gradually fell lower and lower on the houses and buildings of the town.

James saw the conservatory’s caretaker approach before she noticed him. He stood and held open the door for her.

“Thank you, dear. You must be James. My name’s Emily, I take care of the lovely plants here. I’ve got your journal here in my gardening bag - don’t worry, it hasn’t got much dirt or anything on it. I hope you don’t mind, but I caught a glimpse of a few of your drawings - they’re quite good.” She paused as if to say more, but closed her mouth and set down her bag to unpack its items.

“Thanks,” James said. “And uh, thanks for bringing it back to me.”

She flashed a thumbs up, and continued to set more tools out on the ground beside her. He recognized some of their shapes from when his parents enlisted his help with weeding their backyard, but wasn’t much familiar with gardening.

“You take care of this place really well. The plants are so pretty,” he said.

Emily looked up and grinned. “Thank you, dear. Of course, it helps that people are gentle with them. In a way, everyone’s taking care of them just by being respectful.” She stood up and held out the black journal to James. “Here you go.”

“Thanks.”

Crickets had started chirping now, and James glanced over to see the shadows lower on the trees than before.

“Goodness, I got here late today, didn’t I?” Emily said. “Well, that’s alright. I got long sleeves, and it is at least cool now.”

“Is that why you come here in the mornings and evenings, because it’s cooler? At least, since that’s when you told me I could pick up the journal.”

“Sure is!” Emily worked as she spoke, and James watched to see how she treated each plant. He supposed there’d be more to learn at a different time in the season, like when they were first planted or sprouting or something. Still, he liked watching people do things they were good at. He opened his notebook.

“Even if it weren’t for the midday heat, though,” Emily said, “I think I’d still like to come here in the mornings and evenings. They’re just magical times, I guess. Haha, and me here sounding crazy. But there’s just something about that sleepiness, the day waking up or slowing down, the sky all dim and changing colors quicker than you know it.” She paused. “I guess it’s like sharing a moment. Funny, you’re more likely to be alone in these hours, most people ain’t outside. But you all still see the same sunset.”

James smiled. He didn’t know how to respond, but he felt he agreed. He continued to sketch.

The rest of the evening passed by slowly, each person simultaneously working at their own tasks with an occasional word back and forth. James was relieved that Emily seemed content with it. A lot of people would get uncomfortable with silence or push him to respond more. His shoulders relaxed.

As they both finished up what they were working on, they paused and stood together to watch the burning sunset as it reached its orange tendrils across the sky before slipping below the horizon.

“I get to watch these sunsets every day I come out here,” Emily said.

“They’re beautiful,” James said.

Emily smiled. “You oughta come join me, when you have time. Plants could always use another caretaker, after all.”

James smiled back, and carefully tore a page out of his journal, handing it to her. “You can take this as a promise that I will.”

James waved goodbye and walked away, Emily staying behind to pack up her tools all neat and proper. She took a look at the page he’d given her before placing it in her bag.

It was a drawing of the section of daffodils, with an Emily-shaped shadow falling over.
