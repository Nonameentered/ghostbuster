>What makes a good hero?

Flaws. I want them to have humanity, to be imperfect, to have barriers stacked up against them that aren't fully overcome but simply worked with or around. I want them to be hurt, to be tired. I don't want an invulnerable hero. If they're invulnerable in one way, hold them down in another.

A lot of this is personal preference. I like stories of an ordinary person doing incredible things and prefer them over stories of superhumans being on a whole separate scale. I think it depends on what you're going for.

>What makes a good villain?

Impact. The villain has to mean something, to cause real harm and put the main characters in situations where they don't know what to do. I want them to be scary - not even necessarily because they themselves are a horror monster or very intimidating figure, but because their impact and their power is terrifying.

I personally don't believe that you have to show a villain directly. Maybe the villain is the leader of a government or organization, and you never meet the leader directly, but you see what atrocities are caused by said organization. Maybe your characters have met the villain, but the reader doesn't, or you only see snippets of interactions or memories here and there. Like in horror movies where you obscure the monster in shadow and don't see the full creature all at once. Keeping things hidden can be a great strategy depending on what you want the reader to feel.
