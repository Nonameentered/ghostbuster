I think something unique in our writing is the poetic voice. The sort of descriptions we use and the halting rhythm both contribute to this, both in actual poetry and in prose and prosetry.

There are also differences between pieces we work on as a group and individual pieces but that’s more getting into the details. As a group I still think we share a lot of skills and style quirks, probably from working together so much.
