Blink. Tap. Blink. Tap.

The pattern’s been going on ever since I turned off my bedside lamp. Were I more tired, it’d be nice to fall asleep to. But tonight my insomnia decided to kick in, so I’m sitting up in bed at three a.m. and feeling curious.

I push the blankets off my legs and slip onto the floor, still staring at the window. A yellow orange light keeps flashing, and every time I hear a tap like a bird hitting the window. Since I’m on the sixth floor it almost has to be a bird. It’d have to be awake at night, though. Maybe an owl?

But it’s not an owl I see when I walk over to the window. If I had to describe it, I’d say it looks like a spirit. Ball shaped with a little trail beneath it like fabric running off an object, white in its center with an orange glow around the edges and two large yellow ovals that look like eyes. What is this? I place my hands on the window near where it is and they feel cold. Probably the whole window is cold. I sit on the windowsill.

“What are you?” I ask softly. “What cool creature I don’t know about, eh? You’re glowing.” I smile and cross my legs.

It taps on the window again, and I giggle. “Sorry, this isn’t your room. Have you got one? Maybe in a tree?”

It flies up closer to my face and shudders. It taps the window again. “Now dear, you don’t have to make a show of being cold.”

But it keeps shivering. As I watch the shivering grows bigger and I see it sway in its movements, falling and rising and slamming into the window. “Well goodness. I’ll let you in just for one moment, alright? Maybe you have insomnia too, I’ll get you to sleep.”

I reach for the latches and open the window, and the little orange-glowing ball flies into my room along with a nice gust of freezing wind. I grin. “Real cold out there, huh. You better be glad I like the cold, otherwise this wouldn’t be worth it at all.”

I turn around to see the creature next to my shining lamp. Must like the light.

Wait, didn’t I turn my lamp off? Like, five hours ago?

I blink. I feel frozen to the windowsill. What do I do? Do I move? Do I try to shoo it out of my room? Maybe I’m overreacting, I probably just forgot I turned the lamp on. Right?

With my lovely little burst of anxiety, the cold air outside has gone from feeling nice to only making me shiver more, so I stand and close the window. As I pull the glass down again, I see the light from the little spirit creature reflected in it. I watch as it flies toward me.

Then all of a sudden I feel cold. My head turns down of its own volition and I watch from somewhere in my brain as it studies my hands, my clothing. A thought echoes in my brain.

*Thanks for letting me in.*
