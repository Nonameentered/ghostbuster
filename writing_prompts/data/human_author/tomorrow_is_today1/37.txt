In this world, people can use magical spells, but if they use it to transform their own body, there are negative side effects. For temporary transformations (ex: I'm turning myself into a dog for an hour), the side effects are usually temporary. For permanent ones, there is a higher risk of death immediately after and then there will be side effects that last your whole life, leaving you disabled.
