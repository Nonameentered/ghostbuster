A Sailor's Villanelle

The sea batted back at the moonlit sky  
glittering, shining its reflection so clear  
and I saw a spark in the captain’s eye.

I remember when I waved goodbye  
to my family, my home, standing at the pier.  
The sea batted back at the moonlit sky.

The first few months, I used to cry  
full of homesickness and fear  
and I saw a spark in the captain’s eye.

He showed me round, he took me high  
up on the ship, we looked out here.  
The sea batted back at the moonlit sky.

I watched the varied fish swim by  
and caught some with a great big cheer  
and I saw a spark in the captain’s eye.

Then back toward my home we did fly  
with money to make my family’s year.  
The sea batted back at the moonlit sky  
and I saw a spark in the captain’s eye.
