As I stood waiting for the hotel elevator, a family walked up to wait with me. The little girl hopped over to press the already lit button.

The family was all in swimsuits, the parents and a teenager each with extra layers of swim shirts and shorts to hide their bodies. The little girl hopped around in a pink one piece.

“Heading down to the pool?” I asked.

“Yep. What about you?”

“I’m meeting a friend down in the lobby.”

The elevator arrived and we stood together, the little girl hopping up to press the button to ground floor. I wondered how old she was. I was never good at guessing. Seven? Eight?

The elevator reached the ground floor, and we made our separate ways as I waited in the lobby for my boyfriend to arrive.

“Sorry I’m late!” I said as I walked over to Jason, who was sitting in the lobby waiting for me. “Gosh, I hope you weren’t waiting too long. I kept forgetting stuff, then I took a wrong turn on the way here and it was a bit of a mess.”

Jason chuckled as he grabbed a bag from me. “Don’t worry. I brought a book with me anyway.” He winked and gave me a quick kiss.

As we walked to the elevator together to go up to our room, I saw a little girl with wet hair and a swimsuit hopping from foot to foot and pressing the elevator button. She pressed it seven times. I pressed it three more after her.

“To get it up to ten presses,” I said, and she nodded. “My friend does that too! Except she does it five times. I like to make a wish whenever it’s exactly 11:11 on the clock. That’s why I have this watch, see?” She showed me her watch, which was smooth and white. “It’s waterproof so I could even bring it with me to the pool except Mom made me take it off for swimming.”

“Where are your parents?” Jason asked. “You’re here all alone.”

“They’re still swimming. My sibling just told me to go upstairs early and they’d follow in a few minutes. We’re gonna make drawings together.”

Jason thought for a moment. “Why don’t we get a hotel worker to come up with you and lead you to your room? Since you’re all alone.” I nodded. I had been thinking we might go with her, but that would probably look suspicious so I’m glad he said something.

“Hey,” I said, “why are your parents still down in the pool instead of going with you? Are they going to come back up with your sibling?”

She shrugged. “I think they wanted to go with me but my sibling just told them I was using the bathroom. We kinda snuck me out, actually.”

I glanced at Jason. He seemed to be trying to think it over. I couldn’t figure it out. Why wouldn’t the sibling just go with their little sister? This was really weird.

“I’m here now, Anna! The elevator still hasn’t come down yet?” A voice said, and a teenager in a black swimsuit ran up to the little girl. Their swim shirt had long sleeves, and it almost looked like sportswear.

“Nope! They were just asking me where my family was, and now you’re here!” She pointed at me. “He pressed the button ten times like Jesse does. I told him how I make a wish at eleven eleven.”

The teenager smiled and took her hand.

“Are your parents coming?” Jason asked.

The teenager looked startled. “Uh, no, they um, they’re just in the pool still. Still swimming. They were like, floating in the water, floating on their backs like in a lazy river but just the pool.”

Before anyone else could speak, there was a ding.

The elevator had arrived.
