It wasn’t the moment that we met, or any moment in particular. I can’t say when it grew, only that as I knew you more I liked you more too. I can get lost in your dark almond eyes and long wavy hair, and when you turn and smile I feel my face light up in response.

You know that I struggle with making eye contact sometimes. But you’ve got this mole on your cheek that I sometimes look at instead, and I guess I wonder if you remember it’s even there. I know I don’t know the details of my own face as well I do yours.

Is it the same for you, looking at me?

We’re writing a story together. I feel overjoyed. What greater form of intimacy could there be than to share in the act of storytelling? To peer into each other’s brains, our interests and perspectives. We learn from each other too. You’ve pushed me to include more action. You’ve followed my lead in painting emotion.

It feels like we balance each other out in some ways, and for other stuff we can revel in joined chaos. You have this confidence around people that I so admire, all while staying humble and exchanging private smiles with friends. With me. It’s beautiful. Sometimes I’ll be sitting alone so deep in a pit of my own thoughts and you just come around and pull me right back up. I wonder if you know what you mean to me.

So, Dantes, you handsome devil. I’ve spent too long feeling and not talking, so I won’t hide anymore. I probably won’t give you this note, but I’ll talk to you, I think. I will.

God, I hope you’re gay.
