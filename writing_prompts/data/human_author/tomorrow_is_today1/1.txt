Good words, Astro! This is awesome. The piece flows really well and I love the language used in sentences like "The harvest festival will get another guest" and "No more easy path, but he will not concern himself with them". The descriptions of environment also really work to ground it while simultaneously reflecting Ackley's feelings, especially in that last paragraph.

There's a couple specific spots that felt a bit weird. The portion near the beginning where it says "One of the links breaks. With all of his spite, he pulls with his leg until it breaks." felt a bit repetitive in the language (repeating 'breaks') and also left me a bit confused as to what happened. I wasn't sure whether he broke the chain or his leg, especially since one of the links had already broken.

This might just be a me thing, but Caldwell's "Can you forgive us" felt maybe a bit too abrupt? It probably would have felt more natural to me if he had been a bit more defensive at first, or even just said some form of sorry before asking for forgiveness, even if insincere.

Also I think you meant "soul" instead of "sole" in "villagers teasing the unlucky sole who had to interact" in the first paragraph.

Overall, really love this piece! I'm a sucker for a good escape/revenge story (The Count of Monte Cristo is my favorite book), and this built up the story and the world really well. Good words!
