I find certain themes come up in my writing a lot, particularly oppression, trauma and disability (usually mental but sometimes physical or even both), queerness.

I'm definitely at a point in my writing right now where I see all the things I want to be better at but I don't have that skill yet and practicing is hard (plus takes time). It's exciting too, though, because I do have goals. I think a lot of what I want to change isn't even things I'm necessarily bad at, but just don't do enough. There's certain things I often don't include or describe very much, and I want to write more pieces focusing on them. Stuff like descriptions, setting, certain types of emotions, characters, and experiences.

I guess it's hard to say why I get drawn to the same themes so often. I guess a lot of it is probably inspired by personal experience, just drawn out to bigger extremes and made into a fantasy world worth writing.
