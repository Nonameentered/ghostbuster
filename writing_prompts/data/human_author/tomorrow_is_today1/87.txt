He brought her home one night when mom and dad were out. She looked normal at first; back then I thought she was human. He said she was his girlfriend, and I believed him. I think even he believed it, back then. She was nice to him, nice to me. She baked us cookies, laughed at our jokes, and left before our parents could get home. I thought it was so cool that my older brother had a nice girlfriend. I wonder if that was part of what made him stay.

He stayed with her after he knew she was a monster.

I don't know when he found out. He never told me. I shudder to imagine him catching sight of a few too many teeth, finding rashes on his arms where her hands had been, waking up in the middle of the night unable to breathe with a tentacle around his neck. He told me later that she threatened him a lot, constantly reminded him no one would believe in. After all, monsters aren't real, right?

That's what we thought.

I think he must have known after a few months because I remember him visiting our aunt. No one ever visited her, the family called her crazy. But they started to spend a lot of time together. I haven't gone to see her yet, but the whole situation has me wondering. Did she meet a monster too? Did no one believe her?

I'm glad my brother stayed with her, because he stopped talking to me much at all. He wasn't ever at home before I fell asleep, and I'm not even sure he came home then. I asked him one day if he was staying with his girlfriend and why didn't he tell me and could I come visit. He got kinda mad. He said no, no, no. No I'm not staying with her and no you can't visit you can't see her. I got mad at him, then, too. I remembered her being nice and I wanted to spend time with her.

Remember, I didn't know she was a monster.

I think I scared him. I don't think he wanted me to know she was a monster; he wanted to keep me safe. He gave me a hug and he said goodbye and ran away. I felt bad for arguing. I missed my brother. I decided, then, that I had to follow him. To say sorry and play video games together.

That is when I found out.

I snuck into my brother's car and went with him to the place where he stayed with the monster. I stayed outside and decided I would ring the doorbell to talk to him and see if he would let me come in and hang out with his nice girlfriend. Then I saw her through the window.

Our minds have a way of blocking out details we don't want to remember. We still have the jist of the memory and how it made us feel, but we don't remember everything. What I do remember is thinking to myself that she looked really tall and that people weren't supposed to be purple. At first I was just confused, then terrified. I didn't know where I was, and my brother was with a *monster*.

I ran away as fast as I could. I didn't know where I was or where I was going. At some point I found a store and I ran inside. A lady saw me, asked if I was lost, and called my parents for me.

They had all sorts of questions for me when they came to pick me up. I wanted to tell them what happened, then I remembered I wasn't supposed to tell them my brother had a girlfriend. I didn't know what to do. But my mom had a trick. She said since I wasn't supposed to tell them, I could write it down on a piece of paper. So I wrote down that my brother was dating a monster. And then, since they already knew, I didn't think I really had to keep it a secret anymore.

My mom is the smartest.

I don't really remember what happened next. Nobody told me very much. I remember there were lots of phone calls, and my parents kept asking me questions. We even saw my aunt at one point. I waved at her and she smiled. Then she walked into a different room, and I heard her talking. I couldn't hear the words, but it didn't sound like they were smiling.

I think the monster is gone now. All the phone calls must have really done something because my brother is home again and he doesn't have a girlfriend.

But he isn't the same. And I wonder something. When you live with a monster, can they infect you? Like a zombie? Because I've been hearing disturbing sounds in the dark at night, and I counted a lot of teeth when my brother smiled at me the other day.

Can humans turn into monsters?
