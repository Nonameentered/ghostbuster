You called me a monster. My whole life I was told I was a pathetic sinner, that I must bow down low on the ground and pray to be erased and made anew.

You hurt me. I learned to be afraid of church pews, afraid of what you would do to me there. All of it in His name.

Oh, how long I dutifully suffered! I tried so hard to be morally nicer, to turn the other cheek, use your lessons against you, trying in vain to soften your beliefs so they'd leave enough space for people like me to be considered human. I spent years under your torture, always pushing myself to be better, maybe one day I'd finally be enough, or else at least die a merciful and heavenly soul.

I've changed my mind on 'heavenly'.

You want me to be the monster? I will BE the monster. And with those words, I broke in two and a new self emerged, just like you wanted it to. Just the wrong one

I ripped you to shreds, I did. I burned that church to the ground, I tore heads from their bodies, and where am I now? Am I guilty? Am I fallen to Hell, full of anger and pain? (well, maybe). But I have NEVER felt more powerful!

I am certain this power comes straight from Him. He accepts me for precisely who I am, welcomes my violent efforts, and that means that your people are making some very serious mistakes. Keep this in mind when you suffocate here. He wanted you dead. He brought this down Himself, sending me as heavenly punishment, an angel in disguise.
