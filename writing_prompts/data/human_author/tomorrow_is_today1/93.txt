"I don't need your protection, I'm just fine on my own," Emma said.

"Oh really?" Amaya hopped down from her steed, gently pulled Emma from her cart, and handed her a spare sword. She grinned. "Prove it."

Emma crouched and sent flames from her fingertips up through the sword's length. She smirked.

But Amaya's confidence was not deterred. She winked, and in an instant she was gone.

Emma glanced left and right, holding up her sword protectively.

Amaya knocked the sword out of her hand from behind, grabbed Emma by the waist, and turned her around.

"Careful with that fire, hottie," Amaya said. "Might burn your long hair." She pointed at her own short hair, hardly long enough to even be touched by the wind.

Emma blushed and pulled out of Amaya's grasp. "Well, you only got me just 'cause you're impressive. I still don't need your protection, it's not like anyone else can take me."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah."

Amaya reached a hand up and ran it through Emma's hair. "Nothing's gonna change that? Perfectly fine on your own?"

"Yeah..." Emma said, reaching a hand up to meet Amaya's.

"Nothing at all?"

"What are you even asking? You just keep repeating yourself," Emma said.

"Would it change anything if I kissed you on the mouth right now?"

Emma looked her in the eye. "Does that mean you'd like to?"

"Why don't you find out?"
