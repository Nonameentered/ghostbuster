Troy sucked in a breath. He was falling. Falling so fast, in the way where the world starts to spin and your eyes deceive you until you writhe unaware at the images in your brain  
repeating,  
repeating,  
repeating  
out of your control.

“It’s okay, Troy. Breathe,” Jenny said. She took control of their hand and slid it into their hair where it was short and fluffy. “Feel this. You’re here. It’s the present. It’s September fifth, 2022, and it is a Monday. You are at university, inside your dorm room on the third floor of your hall. You are eighteen years old. We’re okay. It’s 2022, it’s the present, we’re eighteen years old, not twelve. We’re right here in our dorm room.”

Troy shivered. He opened their eyes to see they were lying on the floor on their side. He stared at the ground. It was carpet. They were inside. It felt rough against his cheek. Jenny still had control of the mouth and was repeating to him that this was the present, at university. He didn’t remember why he was on the ground. Where he was before he went back in time. At least he was in the present again now.

“Okay,” Troy said roughly. He could still feel Jenny nearby, and others watching in the brain. He wondered if they would front next and get their homework done. On the upside, it was a weekend, so they’d have plenty of time.

“Okay?” Jenny asked. “Are you here? Are you alright?”

Troy shrugged, shifting his head against the ground. Alright didn’t seem right, but maybe it wasn’t wrong. The images were gone at least, though he couldn’t bring himself to move.

“It’s alright, okay, Troy? I’m going to stand us up now and get some water, okay?”

“Okay.”

Jenny took control of the body and walked over to their desk by the window. In a moment she would pace the room and talk to the system, trying to process and planning out what to do next. For now, she just took a breath.

The flashback was over.
