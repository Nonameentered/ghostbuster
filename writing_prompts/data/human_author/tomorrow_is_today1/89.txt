The man was holding a black object in his hand. He flicked it between and around his fingers, a dancing blade controlled with casual ease. One might wonder how many times he had cut himself learning. He would never reveal the information. His expression showed nothing.

In fact, from his expression alone it was hard to tell he was even there. His bright eyes stared into the darkest corners of a room, as if there were something hidden there to be uncovered if you looked hard enough. Long enough. If you didn't blink, and allowed the shadows to take over your vision.

What did he see?

He would never reveal the information. His expression showed nothing.

Out of the blue, the man gripped his black blade and thrust it into the plastic chair he was sitting on, right between his legs. His right hand let go.

His shoulder was bleeding.

It was as if he had stabbed his own right arm instead of the chair. He winced slightly and pulled out the knife with his left hand, standing and exiting the room without so much as a sharp breath. He walked out of the building, down a treeless sidewalk beneath a light grey cloudy sky. It was a moist day, and chilly, and the blood crawled down his back and into his black shirt, indistinguishable at a passing glance to a spilled cup of water.

One might wonder how many times this shirt had been stained and washed. He would never reveal the information. His expression showed nothing.

If he had a reason to be honest, he might tell you of the silhouettes he saw in the shadows, the memories of people they belonged to. He might discuss his forever efforts to grow stronger, more resistant, to find them again someday and remove them from the earth until all that was left of them was an invisible stain.

He would not tell you that he practiced magic only to grow more resistant, because he does not lie. He simply leaves out information. You might not guess it, in a conversation.

If you saw his back, his shoulders, his limbs, there would be no question.

The blade danced between his fingers.
