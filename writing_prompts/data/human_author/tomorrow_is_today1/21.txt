"He's trouble," they always said. Telling stories over the kitchen table, saying he shook things up. Teachers complaining openly about troublemakers and retards as one by one the kids they didn't like left their classes. Sometimes they found a different teacher. Sometimes they dropped out.

I walked by his house once, during one of those times I had to be anywhere but home, and was surprised at how peaceful it seemed. Different, too. No blue ribbons or country flags, just an overgrown yard, some bushes and cobwebs, and a rainbow welcome mat with a painted black fist.

I visited again a month later.

It's hard to say whether things with my family got worse or I just got more tired of it, but I was leaving the house more often in my senior year at high school. Not to clubs, not to coffeeshops or all those too-bright too-loud meeting places they encourage you go. But old sidewalks, creeks, parks. Places with shade and wind and crickets. I'd bring a notebook sometimes to write or draw, but usually I just walked in silence. Sit somewhere when my feet get tired, feel the roughness of the curb through my jeans, and just take in senses. I'd find something to focus on usually, like the swaying leaves of an oak, or an ant crawling by my hand, or wind flapping my shirt against my shoulderblades. It always took a long time for me to get up and move again. Going home felt like walking willingly into Hell. But where else would I go?

So I started to visit his house. He must have had a job or been busy with his "trouble" because he was never home in the afternoons when I came, but that didn't much matter. I needed somewhere to stay, and his porch had shade. I never saw him or even much considered the thought until one evening when I couldn't get myself to go home.

&#x200B;

I didn't fall asleep on his porch, because that would have been committing to staying. I was not committed to anything. I spent the evening conflicted, sitting straight up and frozen as if I might get up and leave any second. I didn't get up. I stared at the sky.

When he did come home, he wasn't driving a car. I wondered if he had one in his garage. How could he afford a house so young, anyway? I hadn't even had a job yet. I felt useless.

He rode a bicycle up to the house and paused when he saw me. He didn't look surprised to see me there, a near-stranger sitting on his porch looking like I'd seen a ghost. He just asked if I would like to come in.

I said yes.

His house was colored by brown wood and warm lighting, with the switches off and lamps on to keep it dim. I liked not having to squint. I liked the silence too. It meant I didn't have to deal with my thoughts yet. I simply followed him.

He made us both tea and heated up slices of a loaf of banana bread for each of us, telling me quietly that it had gluten and dairy in case I couldn't eat those. I could, so we ate in silence. The first words he spoke, after I had finished my slice of banana bread and had my mouth free, were "I know what your name is. What do you go by?"

It took a moment for me to process the request, and I realized I didn't have an answer. All I had was my name, but was it mine? It wasn't chosen. It wasn't fitting. I shook my head, and he nodded, seeming to understand without an explanation. I was grateful. Explanations are always anxious attempts to be believed, so I am ever grateful not to be required one.

"I suspect you know my name as well. But I go by Sunn. Any pronouns are fine, though I'm sure you mostly hear he/him."

I was glad he didn't ask for my pronouns, as I quickly realized I didn't know those either. Somewhere in my brain a voice was asking how I didn't realize my name and pronouns were so in question before now. I heard it, but ignored the voice.

"My sister and a friend are on the upper floor. They don't leave the house much. There is an extra bedroom on this floor, or if you like you can have the couch." Sunn stood up and brought our dishes to the sink. "I don't know if you intend to stay here for a night or for longer, but you are welcome either way. I figure if you were here when I got home, you don't have a great place to go back to."

I nodded and followed him to the extra bedroom, keeping my brain ever blank. Thoughts would be dangerous if I allowed them in now. Need to keep the heart slow and the breathing normal. When we arrived at the room, Sunn asked if I wanted to be woken up sometime, and I shook my head. Then he left, and I sat alone in the darkness on a bed with black sheets, warm and comfortable and numb to my present terror.

I laid on my side. I expected it would take a long time to fall unconscious. I was asleep in minutes.
