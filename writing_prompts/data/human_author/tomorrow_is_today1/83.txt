Gregor and Ryan slid together into the white space, paint mixing gently and covering the remaining portion of the canvas in lavender.

The white shrunk, bit by bit, as the realization came over them. This wasn't an escape. Soon enough the white would be gone, nothing left but paint.

One last spike of red, and the white of the canvas disappeared.

Gregor gasped. He could feel his body again, feel the gentle breeze pass over the hairs on his legs, feel the pressure of the ground against his head. He sat up and turned around to see Ryan next to him.

He sighed. "Ryan. Ryan, wake up, we're okay."

Ryan opened his eyes. He blinked. "What just happened?"

Gregor responded with a shrug, and the two stood up together. Gregor marveled at how simply the air entered and left his lungs, breathing again. You couldn't breathe as a liquid. He didn't envy fish.

"Greg, look at this!" Ryan took Gregor's hand and pulled him over to an object on the ground.

It was a painting. A painting of a rainbow, a lavender, and a kiss.

The pair looked at each other. Thoughts unspoken rose to the surface, questions shared, answers identical.

*I didn't know you felt the same way*.

Rainbow still shining in the sky above, painting not yet dry beneath the bright sun, Gregor and Ryan shared a kiss, and then the day begun.
