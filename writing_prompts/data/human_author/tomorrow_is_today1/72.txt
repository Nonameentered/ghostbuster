Yeah, I think part of the difference is just I'm thinking about being a civilian. Like, I'm gay and disabled, if I were in Nazi Germany I'd be totally fucked. I wouldn't likely be a soldier in either, but as a civilian I'd still be affected depending where I was.

The trenches from WWI are complete nightmare fuel though, for sure.
