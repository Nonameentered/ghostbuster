Burnt autumn colors and black branch-arms crawl from trunks across my horizon, cutting into a light gray sky. I watch a branch sway in winds that bring chills through my body. Its claws snarl and groan. It tilts.
  

  
*Snap.*
  

  
Down, down, down, that branch-arm falls, my arm falling with it. Oh God. It attacks my unmoving limbs, scratching and ripping at skin, moving with cold, cold, winds. I would cry out but find my words lost, my sight blurry, body not moving as I want it to. Body. My body?
  

  
*No. Branch body. Body of roots, of bark, of wood.*
  

  
I sway in this body, sway in cold winds.
