The God of Elves smiled at the party, looking down one them from a throne of white wood. Around the large open room stood guards, each bearing a perfectly blank expression. Where it not for the rise and fall of their chests, they would be indistinguishable from statues.

"You claim to protect them, but you made them into slaves. They can't complain, because you took their voice from them."

Ungul's voice was quiet, his rage palpable. His black beard covered the front of his hand crafted armour. The dwarven leader stood proud, even as he glared daggers at a god.

"Ungul, I did what I had to. Like this, they know no fear. They harbor no anger. War is a thing of the past for them. Instead, my children can live out their days in harmony, as they were always meant to."

He gripped the handle of his warhammer tightly. But it was not him who replied, but a woman of green scales. A long tongue flicked between teeth, leather cords bearing bones resting around her neck. Her tail flicked from side to side as she spoke.

"War, anger and fear is a part of life. You cannot live in the light, for then you have no appreciation for what you have. Darkness and pain, they give you a contrast. You do not give this to them. You force them to live a life half blind."

The God of Elves leaned forwards.

"Pretra, you come from a race that thrives from those aspects. But my elves are not lizardmen. They have no need for such things."

She bared her teeth, frustrated at his lack of thought. The third member of their group poked her in the side. The rune covered lump of rock withdrew it's hand, before rumbling out.

"I am not one who understands such intricacies of races and how they work. But I know that a life in chains is no life at all. Free them, and let them grow. Let them make mistakes, and help them clean it up."

The God laughed.

"Oh, such conviction Orun. And what are you going to do when I say no?"

They jumped, as cold metal circled their throat. It came with a horrible slicing sensation, as their connection to their people cut off. It was swiftly followed by a horrible pain, as a figure of shadows thrust a dagger into their back. It gave a hoarse whisper, as the God arched their back in pain.

"Then we will make you."
