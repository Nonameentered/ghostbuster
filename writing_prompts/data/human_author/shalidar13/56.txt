"This is your captain speaking, please close all blinds."

The voice of the captain was slightly strained, a definite undercurrent to his previously calm voice. Dustin instinctively glanced out the window, as exclamations rang out.

"Where's the sun?"

"It's midday, why is it black?!"

"There's no stars!"

"What's going on?"

From his seat, he could just see out across his seat neighbour. Beyond the plane was nothing but black. No light of the sun, despite being a day flight. No pinpricks of light from stars, but not clouds covering it either. He stared, as one of the flight attendants hurried down the aisle.

"Please, close your blinds!"

Unlike the captain, her voice was panicked. She leaned over where she could, forcibly closing the view outside. Despite the curiosity, no-one chose to argue. Herself and the others rapidly worked down the plane, ensuring there were no ones left uncovered.

"This the the captain. Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know what's going on. Please remain calm, and we will get back on our usual path as soon as we work out how to."

As he stopped speaking, another voice spoke up.

"Wait, I can't hear anything!"

Dustin listened. They were right. The background thrum of the engines was no longer there. It was as though they were flying through something that absorbed all sound. But that was soon broken, by three loud, resonating knocks.

*Bang.... Bang.... Bang.*

The plane fell silent, as eyes looked around for the source. Dustin was the first to speak, asking the question on everyone's minds.

"What was that?"

*Bang.... Bang.... Bang.*

It came again. This time, multiple people looked directly at towards it source. It came near the cockpit, but not quite in there. It sounded like it came from the door they had entered from. But surely that wasn't possible.

*Bang.... Bang.... Bang.*

It kept on knocking. Panic levels began to rise, with people becoming restless. Dustin was beginning to freak out. He hated flying at the best of time. But this, this was nightmarish. His breath came in rapid succession, as he began to hyperventilate.

He stood up, eyes rolling around. He had to move. He couldn't stay there. One of the attendants move quickly to him. He could see her mouth moving, but her words were lost in the rushing in his ears. She tried to block him, but his fear leant his strength to push past.

He pulled his way to the bathroom. He had to get somewhere safer. People yelled at him, but their words too blurred into nothing. He wrenched the door open, forcing his way in. A hand grabbed at it, but he didn't let it stop him. With a burst of strength he slammed it shut, hiding away. He had to get calm. He had to.

Away from the crowd, he immediately felt a little better. But that small rise was quickly quashed by the hammering on the door he had just locked. But they slowed, as he noticed a rushing sound. It came from behind and above. He slowly turned, noticing the vent overhead. It rattled, before bursting open.

Something crawled out of it. It was utterly alien, a shifting mass of tendrils and intent. Dustin opened his mouth to scream, but before he could, it struck towards him. The tendrils spread into his throat, filling it up. He thrashed around, feeling it push further in. He couldn't breath. He couldnâ€™t scream. He couldn't do anything. His vision began to dim, as the something took over.

The Not-Dustin stopped moving. It felt its new form, the strangly solid body. It's main body was safe in the open cave of hard protrusions, with the wet shifting mass beneath it. Behind was an opening into the warm, squishy insides. It felt the controlling threads of this body, manipulating its solid form.

It could tell there were more outside. More bodies for its kin. But there was a solid barrier in its way. One this body had pushed through. But it didn't know how, why it wasn't opening.

Not-Dustin raised a fist, slamming it on the door. It heard cries from within, as it copied the old form-holder from outside.

*Bang.... Bang.... Bang.*
