I stumbled through the rocky terrain, body weak. I had long since lost my way, having fled the field of battle days before. My spear had become a staff, supporting me as I picked my way across unstable ground. I had no destination. I just had to keep going.

My eyes were growing blurry. My breath was laboured, exhaustion weighing me down. I just wanted to sleep. But sleep was death. If I kept going, I could find help. I could survive. I glanced around me, seeing nothing but rocks. I blinked, noticing a difference on one side. A small door, appearing to he made of metal.

I turned towards it. Metal was precious. A door of it had to be there for a reason. No sane man would waste that much on something unimportant. With slightly renewed vigour I staggered towards it. It could be death for me. But I had to hope it wasn't.

I drew closer, seeing it weathered and scratched. It must have been here for some time, that much I knew. I painfully raised an arm, weakly hitting it. For a moment nothing happened, before a red light appeared above it.

"This is a restricted area. Show identification."

I coughed, wincing at my dry throat.

"Pl..ea..se.... he..lp.."

The light flickered, before going out. I felt the ground rumble, and winced. I had clearly angered something. Some form of guardian spirit most likely. I couldn't put up a fight. All I could do was stumble back. The door itself began to open, and the spirit revealed its chosen form.

A golem of some kind, made of grey metal. It's base had two belts it moved on, with weird protrusions. The torso had a pair of graspers, with strange long tubes above them. Its head was similar to a person, though flawless. I tried to ready my weapon, to at least look more than the pitiful state I was in. But trying to hold it made me lose my balance, and I fell to the ground. My vision faded, as I heard the golem approach.

\-----

I gasped awake, eyes opening wide. I was on something soft, as soft as I imagined a cloud would be. Around me was a bright, open room. I lifted my arms, feeling something tug on one. Glancing down I saw a tube leading into me, connected up to some clear membrane.

"You're awake. It's lucky you found me when you did. Any longer and your dehydration and malnutrition would have become terminal."

A similar voice spoke to me as before. But this one had emotion, words of relief.

"Your garb is strange though. Tell me, what is the current state of the world? My uplink was lost, and I have been wondering."

I licked my lips, looking around for its source. I saw none, confirming to me it was a spirit that inhabited this place.

"Thank you spirit for saving me. The world is dark. Lord Tuilo is expanding his reach. Lord Enross fights back, but as you can tell by me being here, it is going poorly."

The spirit was silent, before speaking again, confused.

"I'm sorry? Lord Tuilo and Lord Enross are unknown to me. What of America? What of China?"

The names were strange to me. I had heard of them in myths, but I had paid little mind to them. Now I wish I had.

"I don't know them spirit."

It was silent again, before it's words became amused.

"I am no spirit. Please, call me AMAS. I am a program."

I assumed that I had offended it. Clearly it was stronger than a spirit. I bowed my head.

"I am sorry, great program. Forgive me, I know not the ways of your kind."

It was silent again, before giving a sigh.

"No matter."

There was a strange whirr beneath me, a long rod emerging from below. It bent to touch the tube in my arm, before pulling it out. The tube fell below the membrane, and the rod withdrew.

"Please get up. I believe I have an understanding of what has happened. But it means I am in need of a new Director. You seem like the right person to help me reestablish my connection to the world."

I slowly got up, utterly confused. But I placed faith in this program. It had every opportunity to kill me, or let me die. But instead it saved me, and seemed geniune. A section of wall slid away, revealing the same golem as before.

"Please, follow this drone."

I obeyed without question. It lead me through strange tunnels, all lavishly made of metal. I was hopelessly out of place here, surrounded by unimaginable wealth on all sides. If I took even a small portion I would be rich. But I had no way of knowing how to leave. And I had no wish to anger something stronger than a spirit.

It lead me to a platform, a series of lights on one side. The drone pressed something, and the floor began to drop. I panicked. Surely this was descending into the earth, where demons lived.

The side fell away, and I gasped. It was an enormous cavern, coated in metal like before. But that wasn't what surprised me. What did surprise me was the monstrous forms frozen in place. They were made of some metal I had never seen before, clearly made by something other than human hands.

They were enormous. Their feet could crush my home with ease. They would tower over even the greatest of castles. I could make out a shape to them, roughly humanoid. But their arms ended in bizarre contraptions. These were avatars of the gods.

"Welcome to the Titan Hanger."
