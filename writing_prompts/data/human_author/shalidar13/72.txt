The living were amusing. Not so long ago, their grandparents lived in fear of me. I had spread terror across the country, as I claimed its land for my own. They believed I would slaughter them, and raise all as undead beneath my command. They believed I would turn it into a desolate wasteland.

Such a small idea. In my early years i had intended that. A place of utter death, without the noise and unpredictability of the living. But I changed. I had no love for life that much was true. But by letting it grow and fester, I would gain a greater number of corpses. Indeed, I could experiment on some to give me even greater soldiers.

There were some of those who thought they could stop me. Misguided fools who called themselves heros. They attacked my forces, destroyed places of interest, generally making my campaign that much harder. It all came to a head when they snuck into my lair.

Oh the battle was fierce. If I still had a heart, it would have been beating with adrenaline. They fought well, in a surprisingly effective team. But I was a foe they could not beat. Though I did not slay them immediately, for such willing subjects were hard to come by. I took them, turning them into my Generals, their strength backing my own. With them at my side, I claimed all that I desired.

But now, I did not need to conquer any more. I had an empire of my own. The rest of the world was a mere annoyance, one I knew others would claim. But I had no desire to rule it all. Just this place, and these living cattle.

Instead, I had to defend here. Those other places wanted to take my land. They said they wished to free my people, claiming I kept them as slaves. They are all cretins. I do not subjugate my people like that. If they were in chains, they would try to break free.

I let them live. I let them enjoy their little towns, and making their little happy families. I do not terrorise them, and they do not plot against me. Sure, there are a few dissenters. I use extreme force against them. But to the common person, I protect them. Magical creatures attack their homes, my armies hunt them down. They get saved, and I get a new addition to my growing force.

In times of disaster, I sent in the Corpse Finders. They locate the dead, and in doing so help save the living. I make sure areas are stable, so that I continue to get my steady flow of corpses. And they get peace knowing that they can live there.

They once called me a parasite. Now they know we are in a symbiotic relationship. As long as they live, I mostly leave them alone, and they get to enjoy life. But when they die, their bodies are mine.
