Just looking at my costume was enough to make my powers activate. Everyone else had cool, sleek looks, merged with their powers to make them the embodiment of what they were. They looked awesome, and I could tell they felt awesome as well.

Mine was a clown costume. Literally. Big shoes, hideous polka-dot shirt, dungarees a horrid yellow. I had an annoying fake flower, and a big red nose. The base had a rapid face painter for me as well, letting me get ready nearly as quickly as the rest. And I hated every second of it. I hated circuses, clowns, the whole lot. So naturally they called me the Ringmaster.

But I couldn't deny its effectiveness. When not on duty, they would ensure I was treated well. When I put it on, they let out the snide comments. I knew they didn't truly mean anything bad, but in the heat of the moment sometimes having someone point out that my socks didn't even match would give me the push I needed.

It wasn't as though my powers were particularly flashy either. I would just get stronger, faster and harder to hurt the more hate I felt. This extended to things I held, meaning the inflatable hammer they gave me really packed a punch. Whilst my official call was the Ringleader, I knew of my unofficial designation as the Juggernaut.

I sighed as I started to put on my ridiculous suit. A call had come in about one of the Grave Stalkers. They had started a ruckus, something about an artifact activating that they wanted. I didn't really care though.

Like always I was the last to be ready, and our flyer was ready to go. I boarded as I heard the start of the whispers.

"Late again."

"Stupid costume."

"Why is he here?"

I hated them. I hated that my powers needed them to do it. I focused on my hatred, feeling muscles tighten and skin harden. I glance at Coordinator, speaking with a voice modulator to make even that sound like one of the stupid people.

"I'm assuming we are going with the wrecking ball approach?"

She glance at me, nodding whilst rolling her eyes.

"Obviously. Like was always do."

It stung. I hated it. But it would help me in my fall to earth. After all, it had been proven that there was little more disruptive than a six-foot grumpy clown armed with what was basically a sledgehammer being dropped into the centre of a gathering.

I just hated that it was me who had to do that. Again.
