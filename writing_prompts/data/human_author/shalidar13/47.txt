The human, Martin, bent to retrieve his rifle. I kept my aim on him ready to act. He slung it over his back, reachable but not quickly. My threat assessment of him decreased, with such voluntary disarmament. He left the path I had been following, choosing instead to walk between trees.

I kept my sensors up, following behind the human. His words indicated it was unlikely to be a trap. However I was still in an unconfirmed situation. I had no set routine for the current scenario, beyond returning to the rally point. Vigilance was key in an evolving scenario.

Martin stopped, looking at his dog. The dog was staring intently towards a group of heat signatures. Clearly animal, likely his prey. He looked to me, indecisive.

"There's a group of boars over there. They've been ruining the local area, and need putting down. I'm not going to target you, so please don't shoot me."

Boars. I ran down my records. There was a brief description of them. An invasive species. Humans would eliminate them to protect their lands. Larger one could prove dangerous. If they turned on Martin, I would loose my best current source of information. He had proven friendly thus far. The solution was simple.

Inside my arm, a firing chamber and two barrel sections rotated into place. My elbow straightened, connecting the barrels together. I hoisted my now prepared precision weapon, aiming it towards the boars. Martin had readied his own rifle, kneeling and taking aim.

**Crack Crack**

Two shots fired at near identical timing. His was smaller, aimed towards one of the larger ones. Mine was larger, the shock wave spraying a mist of collected rain drops around us. I dropped the largest boar, already changing to the next. Martin's shot had definitely hurt his target, but it wasn't dead yet.

**Crack**

I downed another boar. Target markers danced around as they started to flee, and I aimed at another.

**Crack Crack**

Another pair of shots. Martin finished off his initial target, and I removed another. The remaining ones ran between trees, disappearing. Martin showed no sign of wanting to pursue them, instead smiling at me.

"Thanks for the help there. They are an absolute menace. I don't suppose you could give me a hand shifting them? No sense in letting good meat go to waste."

I needed to gather information. But the human wanted to conduct the interview in comfort. Moving boar carcasses would delay this. My assistance would decrease the time spent. I disconnected my precision weapon, returning to burst. I moved to the larger ones, picking them up. My older servos groaned at the effort, but remained functional for now.

Martin hoisted the smaller one over his shoulders, staggering slightly under the weight. He nodded at me, walking off again. I followed again, still scanning the area.

His route took us to a road, where a vehicle was parked up. Its outside was weathered, rust climbing the edges of some panels. The truck had a large bed, that he hoisted his boar onto. He slapped it, rolling his shoulders.

"You can put them up here. Erm, it might be a tight squeeze in the front, do you mind sitting out here as well?"

I regarded the cab. Definitely designed for humans. My larger frame could fit, however I would restrict the drivers movements. A poor idea to follow. I placed the bodies down, and scanned for the best bracing points. Although the exterior was worn, the internal frame appeared strong. I oit my manipulators on them, hoisting myself into the bed.

The truck dipped as I did, my mass significantly higher than that of the three boars combined. It didn't break, however the stress would cause greater wear during this journey. Martin nodded to me, heading towards the cab.

"Don't worry it ain't a long drive. Then we can talk."

I detected a message being sent. I intercepted it, reading it as it went towards its recipient.

>You'll never guess what I found. I'm coming back now.

I cycled in a round, hearing the engine rumble to life. That could be a trap now. The threat level was rising. Beneath me the truck slowly began to move, straining against the load. I kept my sensors up, reading the world around me. I catalogued the threat of all that I passed, in case of ambush.

As we travelled my diagnostic completed. There was corruption in my code. Not something I could isolate, as it was in most parts. I had two options. Locate a repair station, and undergo a reinstallation process, or self terminate. Another thought came through, this time an order.

*I will not self terminate.*

After seven minutes of driving, we pulled into a driveway. I scanned the area, noting a two storey building. Likely residential. The front was open, a few smaller animals walking around, apparently chickens. I detected another life form running towards us, smaller than Martin but still human shaped. Martin stopped us, practically leaping out to hug the small human.

"Daddy! You're back!"

He laughed, lifting the child into the air.

"Of course I am dumpling. Have you been good?"

The child nodded, giggling.

"I'm always good Daddy."

I climbed down from the bed, eyes on them. Martin had a family here. It was unlikely to be a trap then. Though the child seemed surprised to see him back. I didn't know who he had told. The child stared at me, eyes wide.

"What's that Daddy?"

Martin put them down, crouching beside them.

"It's someone who needed help. Could you go and get Soph for me please dumpling? Tell her we will be on the porch."

The child nodded, running off. I monitored her run, whilst turning to Martin.

"Citizen, who is Soph? Who did you communicate with?"

He frowned, before exhaling.

"How? Oh right, you're... anyway, Soph is a good friend, who I texted ahead. She will be a better one to explain than I. This way."

He began to walk up towards the house. I followed again, scanning the porch. It held a bench with a swinging seat. No weapons of any kind. Danger was unlikely. The floor was wood, unlikely to support my weight. He climbed up the three steps, whilst I waited at the bottom.

A door opened, and the child ran out again. They were followed by a bright blue figure. Human shaped, but clearly a droid like me. No armour plating to speak of. No obvious weaponry. A face with movable parts. They looked at me, gasping.

"Is... are... you found an Alpha!"

I searched my memory. Nothing about an Alpha, beyond temporary designations.

"Droid. State serial and objective."

They looked at me with an expression of wonder.

"You live? I thought you were all lost in the Revolution?"

"Droid. State serial and objective."

They shook their head.

"My name is Sophie. We don't have serial codes any more. We don't have objectives. We just have our own lives."

That didn't compute. All droids were required to have a serial. Any exiting the base must have an objective. This was one with neither, and with no weapons.

*I want my own life.*

"Citzen. Droid. Explain this."
