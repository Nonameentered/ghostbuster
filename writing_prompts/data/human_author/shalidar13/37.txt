"What are we looking for?"

I smiled, glancing at my guards. They were eager sorts, fresh from the Adventurers Guild training halls. This was a nice easy job for them. I liked to hire newbies, and give them their first paying job. It gave them a boost to start their careers, and got my name in their minds.

"Good ones to look out for are Fenswort, Gratheberries and Dayshade. Fenswort helps make basic healing potions, Gratheberries stamina potions, and Dayshade is a mana restoration. I however am looking for a couple of bespoke ingredients."

I pulled out my guidebook, pointing at each herb. I didn't need it, having been at this for years. But for them it was a boon. It made them feel helpful, and helped me get some additional materials. The one experienced adventurer I had with me snort, raising an eyebrow.

"Oh aye? What are you looking for then? The fart of an owl? Maybe the first tears of a baby rabbit?"

I flipped her off, chuckling. We had know each other for a long time, Tryina and I. She had been with me for many gatherings, and knew my ways.

"Close but not quite. My shop gets a little stuffy sometimes, so I need to made something to manage the temperature. If I am right, which I always am, I need the beat of a butterflies wings, and the breath of a forest spirit."

"Oh I see, just that huh?"

I laughed.

"For a start here. There are other materials I think I might need, but they will be sourced elsewhere. For now though let's stick with that."

Tryina gave a nod, looking at the fresh-faced adventurers.

"Alright guys. Let's do this. Stay close, shout if you spot any danger. Remember, Oligun here is our priority. If he dies, we don't get paid."

She paused, tilting her head.

"Well, that and we will then be on the bad side of pretty much every party and noble in the surrounding hundred miles. So don't mess this up."

The others nodded, looking a little worried. I smiled, clapping my hands together.

"Don't worry, I have every bit of faith in your skills. As a bonus, if you can find me an urnful of the three herbs I mentioned I will give you all a free potion of your choice from those basics."

That made them focus. Potions weren't the cheapest of things, with the time it took to prepare and the raw ingredients. A free potion could very easily be the difference between life and death for them.

"We won't let you down."

I grinned, clicking my fingers.

"Well then, let's get to work."
