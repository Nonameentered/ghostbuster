"In our village sweet, beneath the stars,
We dance and laugh and sing,
But if you leave into the mists,
The fates will take everything."

The child smiled sleepily, as their mother laid them down. They had lived in a village for so long, most memories of the outside world had faded. Only those who were prepared could leave, only those who could be lost. Any others were forbidden. It grew into a song for the children, warning in lyrics.

This child slept in their home, mind filled with thoughts and dreams. An innocent soul, one loved by many. One who could not be lost. Yet none knew this was the last night the child would rest here.

They rose with the sun, giggling as they followed their parents around. They played with each other, and the child sometimes played alone. Some lessons were taught on nature, and farming, but only briefly. As a youth, the attention span was measured in minutes at most.

After the midday meal, the child wandered off. They found a butterfly, giggling as they ran after it. Their focus was held by the colourful thing, ignoring the danger as they drew close to the village boundary. They paid little mind as the butterfly passed through, disappearing into the mists. They ran out to follow, warnings forgotten.

The mists wasted no time. An open mind was there, untrained and unguarded. It poured into the new vessel, bringing with it ancient thoughts and memories. The child cried, clutching their head as these images filled their mind.

The thoughts of a long dead people. Random fragments and memories. The taste of pie, mixing with bitter liquor. Blinding lights and pitch black caves. Laughs, screams and silence. Soft fabric and harsh canvas. All mixing into a maelstrom, a cacophony of the past.

It slowed as the final memory of the past pushed through. A group of humans, elves and dwarves around a crystal sphere. They spoke in harmony, a forgotten tongue winding together. The child knew their goal, as understanding of each participant forced its way in.

A desire to spread magic to all. To give all the same strength, the same potential. A charitable mission, gone horribly wrong. The sphere took in their magic, but did not stop there. It drew in their minds and thoughts, and those of all around. It drew in more and more, a terrible siphon, that reached around the world. But pockets were unable to be taken, held in wards of antimagic.

The sphere could not contain it all. It broke, spreading power and knowledge to all, a black mist of energy ruining the Arcane Weave. One that sought to fill any who stepped in. The minds of the participants had imprinted on it, even as they were torn asunder. It called to those filled with thr knowledge to use it, and fix what they had done.

The child cried, turning back to the village. But those boundaries they had crossed now held them back, the power too involved with the child's form. Their home was barred to them, even as they fought through the broken shades of long ago.

The child had to leave, the final commands weighing on their mind. They were young, but full of its purpose. The magic would sustain their body, letting then dedicate their time to fix the mistakes of the past. They walked alone into an abandoned world, the only comforts they held in the world lost to them.
