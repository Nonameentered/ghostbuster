"Harvey, we got a job for you. Give me a call back when you wake up, my favourite hairy beast."

I rolled my eyes as I listened to the message. Jeana was a good agent, if a little irritating at times. With care I put the phone back on my beside cabinet, stretching. I felt a aeries of clicks, groaning in satisfaction.

I pushed off my duvet, slowly climbing out of bed. My eyes were well adjusted to the dim light, part of my unnatural gifts. I looked at my mirror, seeing the fur on my body sticking out in all directions. I was as tall as ever, with thick body and limbs.

With a yawn I moved to my ensuite door, keeping my claws close to my sides. I had to delicately pull down the handle, gouges in the door reminding me of the many times it took to perfect this. I managed to leave it unscathed this time, as I nudged it open. I turned on the light, quickly doing my morning business.

As I flushed the toilet, I took out a new bottle of dog shampoo. At first I found it humiliating, using this sort of product. But I had fur now, not human hair. It was different, and so needed different treatments. The closest to it was dog fur, hence the shampoo. It had taken time to find one I liked, with a minor level of scent to it. Most people probably wouldn't detect it, but they would certainly smell wet dog.

The shower itself was quick. I had it down to a science, washing this much fur quickly and thoroughly. It stuck to my body, highlighting the muscles I had grown since the change. I barely worked out, but this was still ridiculous. Part of me wanted to see what would happen if I out effort in, but that was only a small part. I broke enough stuff even when trying my best not to.

As I turned off the shower, I grew excited for the next part. It was an absolutely ridiculous thing. For some it might be seen as a rich guys extravagance. For me, it was a necessity to be able to wash and get ready without spending two hours blow drying myself. I depressed a button, grinning like a buffoon as my inbuilt surround drier got to work. It was like standing in the middle of a tornado, but less destructive.

I retrieved my series of brushes, combing through my fur as it dried. I might be a beast, but it was no excuse to look like one.  By the end I looked a little puffy, but not too much. It helped soften my image, which definitely helped my case with the kids. At the start I had given a lot of youngsters nightmares, with my unkempt appearance. Now I looked super huggable, a much better view in my opinion.

Once dry, it was time to choose my trousers. I had given up wearing tops at this point. They were uncomfortable at best, pushing all my fur up against me. Plus I ended up looking lumpy, generally ruining the appearance. If I had to go formal, I found a waistcoat made a good comprise. Trousers however were a must. I favoured baggier ones, ending up with a bunch of jogging bottoms.

I chose a light grey set today, contrasting my dark brown fur. As I pulled it on, I picked up my phone again. I used the pads of my fingers to unlock it, dialling Jeana.

"Good morning! How is my ball of super menacing fluff doing today?"

I rolled my eyes.

"I'm doing fine. What's this job you are so excited for?"

I heard a rustle, and I pictured her at her desk. Probably with a mug of ginger tea, and piles of paperwork that she liked to ignore unless necessary.

"So direct fuzzy. Well, they want to do a film involving Egyptian gods. And they want you to play Anubis if you are interested?"

"Doesn't he only have the head of a dog?"

I heard a slight chuckle.

"True. They did ask if you would be up for being shaved-"

I let out an involuntary growl.

"Not going to happen."

"Oohh, that was a good one. Have you been practicing? Want to be the big bad wolf?"

I breathed through my nose.

"You had better have told them no."

She laughed again.

"Naturally. Don't worry, the only time you will lose fur is when you shed. Anyway, they didn't mind it. Apparently there will be very few full body shots of you. Mostly just head, and for those body shots they can cgi you with a human body."

I sighed.

"That doesn't sound too bad. Sent me the script and I'll have a look."

"Already on its way."

I heard her chair creak, as she probably leaned back.

"Anyway, are you still happy going to the convention next week? You are allowed to not go to every single one."

I grinned at that.

"Of course I am. Do you have any idea how many people want to hug me there? And the amount of head scratches I get, mmmmm, so good."

Jeana laughed at that.

"Oh you are the bestest boy aren't you? Are they going to make you play fetch as well?"

A laugh came out of my lips.

"You wish. Anyway, got to go. I need to hunt down some breakfast."

"Take care Fido. I'll call you later."

"Bye you cheeky little-"

The line went dead, and I grinned. Irritating, but I couldn't deny those conversations were always a blast. My stomach grumbled, and I rubbed it. Time for some food.
