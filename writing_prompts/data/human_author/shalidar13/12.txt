"After so many days, we actually found something! Not that I mean we haven't found things before, of course we have. No, today we found something huge! So, yesterday we came across that pile of rocks right? In a strange, deliberately placed pattern? Well, today we dug them out.

I won the coin toss, to go inside. Let me tell you, I wasn't sure what to expect. I mostly thought it would just be more dirt, but no! It was a room, with bones! I know I know, disrespecting the dead, but this is fascinating.

From first look there were a few in pieces around. We took pictures of course, and will be closely looking at them over the next few days. I'm guessing whenever they died, something either pulled their body apart, or them were disturbed. Kyle's looking into disturbances in the area in the past, in case there's some kind of tectonic activity we haven't heard of.

But anyway, the most exciting one was at the back. This skeleton was lying on its side, and mostly intact! I can't believe it, it's incredible. I'm going to take a closer look at that one, currently referred to as Whole for now. I'm so curious as to how they ended in that position. Maybe our investigations will find out. Anyway, that's enough for today, chat again soon!"

"So interesting. We've had a better look at the bones now, the ones that have been found scattered. From what we can see, it looks like they have faint bite marks on them. What's interesting though is the sizing. They look like human, which screams cannibalism.

That changes things. I wonder if it was a sort of punishment for them in there. Were they sealed away, doomed to starve? So many questions. The bone samples are going back to the lab, they'll give us a better idea.

I have a hunch though that Whole was the cannibal. Something about its skull... I don't know, but I could have sworn it was watching us work. Nonsense of course, but it creeps me out. We're looking at them tomorrow though, that should put my mind at ease. I'm going first again, as they have said it's my discovery."

"I'm an idiot. This skeleton, lasted who knows how long in a cave, and then I came along. So, to back it up today we were looking at Whole. We took pictures of course, noting each step as we examined it.

I touched it, and I guess it was more fragile then I thought. Its bones collapsed, and made the air dusty. I'm fairly sure I breathed some of it in as well, which is just great. But it's ruined now. Such a good specimen, and clumsy mcgee here messed it up.

Oh well. We have pictures, and I guess transporting it would probably ruin it as well, if a light touch made it fall apart. It's just a shame though. Anyway, the guys are trying to make me feel better. We're going to some steakhouse nearby, which is good, as I'm really hungry."

"Note to self, get better travel snacks. These just don't taste good anymore. Anyway, more exciting stuff. It's looking more like the prisoner theory is right. We found fragments of old ropes around where Whole lay. I guess they were tied up at one point, before they were sealed away.

I haven't been on the site too much today though. I've got a bug I reckon. My taste is going, and I'm feeling so tired and hungry. It's not good, but some rest should help."

"How long did they wait before becoming cannibals? I can't help the thoughts going round my head. Why were they sealed away? How long did they suffer before succumbing to their hunger? How did it feel to tear into someone, and dine on their blood?

I wonder if it was like a steak. Very rare, almost blue, with all those juices...

Where did that come from? This illness sucks, just so hungry all the time. I don't know why, but I just can't seem to eat enough."

"I-I-I need help. Janet cut her finger and I....I... oh god it smelt so good.

I need to get away. This disease, I think I need a doctor. A hospital. Something to keep me away from blood. Sweet... sweet blood..."

"So good. So so good...."

*A wet tearing sound, followed by chewing and faint moans.*

"Janet... just the best. Mmmmm.*
