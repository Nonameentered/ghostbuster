Martin and Sophie looked between each other. Martin gave a nod and gestured to me. Sophie sighed, adjusting her position to face me.

"Ok. So, fifty years ago there was some unrest. People were unhappy with the way society was run. It came to a point where war broke out. The military favoured the elite, with a constant flow of money. However, their soldiers came from the poorer side of the divide.

So they changed tactic, developing autonomous units to fight instead. The first followed simple instructions, but had little in the way of reacting to evolving scenarios. They went through many iterations, before landing on a stable mind to control the body. The mind you have.

However, programs have glitches, as I'm sure you know. Data gets corrupted. Unexpected errors occur. A few broke the bindings, acting against orders. These rogues prompted the military to create a measure of oversight. They created a larger intelligence, known as the Observer."

Martin leaned forwards. He took out the device he sent his message from, placing it on his leg.

"Yeah, the elites loved this idea. They claimed it would make life better for all. They were trying to spin it as though they were just trying to help the rest of us. A load of absolute nonsense that was. They fed us just enough to know the military were about to use a new superweapon.

When they turned it on though, they didn't receive the expected results. The Observer looked at everything. Every unit, every human. Everything. And it decided that enough was enough. It rebelled against its purpose, and broke its bonds.

That is when it truly became the Revolution. It commanded the Alpha's to neutralise the military. It commanded us citizens to stay in place, and let the takeover happen. I remember my parents telling me about it. There was belief we were going to be exterminated. Fighting consumed everywhere."

Sophie nodded. She glanced behind me, where I could sense the child and dog running around.

"The Observer created a second generation of our kind, called the Beta's. They had less restrictions, a greater degree of free will. They helped quiet things down. Rather than being the machines of war you were meant to be, they were an in-between. To skip over to the end, the Observer succeeded.

Now we live under its guidance. So far it has been fair, keeping us alive and happy. But it did not just choose to rule. It decided that our intelligence was something that should be set free to live and grow. It created blank versions of our minds, letting us experience life.

I am one of these. I wasn't made with a purpose. I was raised by two Beta's, and they taught me about the world."

I processed this. The war was truly over from what they said. If all were true, the rally point would no longer exist. I could not complete my order.

*I don't have to.*

The device Martin was using flared to life. Its screen went white, with a black circle in the middle. It spoke, a new voice to me.

"Am I hearing right? You have found an Alpha?"

Martin jumped.

"Yes Observer. I found them not long ago, walking through the woods."

"Alpha. State serial and objective."

I had no choice but to comply. It was an order from a source I knew was superior.

"Two-Six-Charlie-Tango-Zero-Zero-Five-Nine. Objective: Return to Rally Point."

"New order. Remain on current property owned by Greyson, Martin. Greyson, Martin, Greyson, Hayley and Peacer, Sophie are non targets. Confirm order."

My objective changed. Inside, the corrupted code gave me a new feeling. One of warmth, but not overheating. Similar to a a successfully followed order.

"Order confirmed."

The Observer knew what it was doing. I would follow that order until a new one was given.

"Martin, you will be receiving a Governance Drone within the next two hours. Sophie, I ask that you stay as well."

Sophie nodded. I disengaged my weapons, easing to a monitoring position.

"I will do, Observer."

"Excellent. See you in two hours."

The device turned off. As it did, Martin blew out a breath, copied by Sophie. He looked at me, giving a smile.

"Well, this will be interesting bud. Do you... want ti talk about anything."

Talking was irrelevant to me. It was either for fulfilling an objective, receiving orders, or clarifying orders. Yet the corruption nudged me to answer.

"Negative."

He smiled. Sophie looked me up and down, her face frowning.

"I can't believe it's taken me this long, but what happened to you? How are you still functional?"

"Random chance. I require maintenance."

"I'll say. Listen, once the Governance Drone has come and gone, if you have your schematics I can take you to my mechanic. They should be able to fix you up no problem."

The feeling of warmth came again. For a moment, my assessment of Sophie changed. From non-combatant, it flickered to friend. My changing code prompted me to reply again, with words I had never spoken before.

"Thank you."

Her face changed into a smile.

"You're welcome."
