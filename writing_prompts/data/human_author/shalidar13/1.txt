"Thank you for coming out here."

I held a hand out to the woman as she stepped down from her carriage. A soft green dress hung around her, wafting gently in the breeze. A golden necklace hung around her neck, set with a sapphire in the shape of an eye. Her ears were pointed, small gold rings piercing its tips.

"You're welcome. Show me to this water you sent word about."

He tone was soft, but gave no option to argue. I nodded, slowly dropping my hand. I could feel the sweat already forming, as her presence scared me. But I straightened my back, leading her on.

"It's just around here."

She nodded, her eyes slowly raking across the landscape. Every now and then they stopped, as if taking something in, before continuing their sweep. I shivered a bit, knowing I was beyond outclassed.

I breathed a small sigh of relief as we reached the hole. Much of it had been completed, before I had realised the issue with the water. I didn't know much about magic, but water that shimmered every colour of the rainbow was certainly not natural. And knowing how dangerous magic could be, I didn't want to poke it.

"Hmmmm, were you aware this was a leyline focal point?"

I shook my head, as she beckoned a bucket with one of her figures. It rose into the air, wafting towards us. She pointed down, and it disappeared into the well below. She waited for a minute, before bringing it back up. Sure enough, it contained that same shimmering water.

"Interesting. Normally it's a non-reagent. The amount of excess..."

Her voice trailed off into mutters as she stared at the water. With a snap of her fingers she tore open a small hole in the air. Her hand disappeared into it, before coming out with a handful of arcane instruments. She set them up in the air, drawing some of the water and putting it in a few vials.

"Can I help you with anything?"

I was careful in my words. It was an offer, but not one that said I would do it. I knew mages could be tricky with words.

"No. This will take a while. I will find you when I need you."

It was a clear dismissal. I just nodded, secretly grateful to be able to get away. I had animals to feed, and crops to check. Hopefully she could confirm if it was safe to use or not. That, or let me know it if was useful to the mages. If they wanted it, I could easily charge them, and live comfortably from the supply. They might be tricky, but it was said they followed contracts to the letter
