"The Harvesting Touch?"

Zivro frowned at the mage. They were agitated, looking between the sword and him. Almost afraid of what they had found.

"Thats its name yes. It... um... it belonged to... well, a monster. Thankfully a long dead one. But having had a look, and knowing the stories, this... this is a dark weapon."

Zivro ran a finger along the flat of its blade, feeling the slight dips and bumps of the runes within.

"And what does it do?"

The mage grew even more nervous.

"Well... said you got better at fighting the more you used it? And... um... your desire for... blood.. increased? That's the... souls of your slain foes... um... binding to you."

Zivro paused. He didn't doubt the mages words. It almost made perfect sense, as if a deep part of him already knew. He slowly moved his hand back down the blade.

"Really?"

The mage nodded hurriedly.

"Yes. Um... its a dark weapon... it should be taken, destroyed if possible. Nothing good will come from it."

Zivro gave a thoughtful nod.

"How would we do that?"

The mage gave a grateful grin, turning to his books.

"Well, such a weapon is potent. It would need to be shattered as the enchantments are temporarily dispelled. Failing that, an active volcano would-"

Their voice cut off, and Zivro twisted the sword now sticking in their back. He gently eased them down, taking it out and letting blood pour out.

"Thats good to know. Thank you for your help, I will be sure to remember that."

He grinned as they gave a rattling gasp, life leaving their body. A sensation came over him, one that had escaped his notice before. It was a burning rush of warmth and cold, and he felt the flicker of something. He grinned wider, looking at the blank face on the corpse.

"A monster hey? Sounds like I've got some big boots to fill."
