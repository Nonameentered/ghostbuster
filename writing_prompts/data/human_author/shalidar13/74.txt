They clamoured for my attention. Not an hour went by without someone beseeching me. Some wanted knowledge, others power. They called for blessings for their friends, curses for their foes, and a whole host of other requests.

Some I would answer. If the caller caught my interest, or their request was worth granting. Sometimes they made sacrifices I would want, if it was something that intrigued me at the time. I could still remember when I took the first cow, and suddenly everyone wanted to sacrifice one.

I sat on my throne of light, listening to their pleas. A couple I sent representatives to, where it seemed more important to my continued worship. They would act in my best interests, and ensure my church thrived.

One plea caught my ear. It was a single person, a child. But they were not calling in fear or anger. It was a plea full of the innocence of youth, a pure, peaceful soul. They promised no riches, no favours, no living sacrifice. But they promised a treasured gift for them.

I was intrigued. It was something away from the centuries of boredom I had been feeling. With but a thought I appeared before the child, as they sat in a little room. They were apparently a boy, wearing noticeably worn clothes. Looking around, the cramped room seemed to be mostly made of second hand items.

"Child, why have you called on me?"

His eyes widened, before he gave a wide grin. From a pocket he took out a squashed bar of something, holding it out to me.

"Mommy says you live up in the sky, but that means you can't have food. So I thought you would be hungry."

I was touched. I was used to people calling me for favours. It was all they ever did. To be called on just to give me something, that was truly special. I reached out to take it, feeling the bar beneath my fingers. A glance told me it was chocolate, something I hadn't tried before. I didn't need to eat, but sometimes it was nice to have food.

"Thank you child. That was very kind of you."

His grin widened, and he gave a joyful giggle. I smiled in return, opening it up. With a snap I broke it in half, giving him the larger piece. He accepted it, and took a bite. I followed suit, tasting the sweet deliciousness. I knew it was probably the cheaper kind, but in that moment I didn't care. To me, it was the most amazing thing created.

In short order I finished it, savouring the taste. He had nearly matched my speed, though much was plastered around his mouth. I waved a hand to clean it off, making him giggle again at the tickling sensation. I felt the world around us, realising there were no others in the house.

"Child, where are you parents?"

He pointed to the outside world.

"Mommy has gone to work. She said she would be back before it got dark. Daddy..."

His face dropped.

"Daddy went away. We visit him sometimes, when Mommy doesn't have to work."

I could feel the truth behind his words. His father was dead, and his mother had to work hard to keep them alive. He didn't call on me to help, but he called on me nonetheless, and paid me. I knew I could just leave, but his generosity touched me. I could help him and his mother. And I would.
