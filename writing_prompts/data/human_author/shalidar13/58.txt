"We are dying."

Words came forth from the column. It was ancient, serving as the seat of power in this section of the galaxy. One of the many Precursor relics scattered throughout the stars, it was the most studied of them all. Yet after all this time, none had been able to work out how to activate them. Until the delegate of the newest race placed their hands on it, as had become custom.

"Though war has harried us, it is not the cause of our fall. Though sickness has at times run rampant, we are not falling to its clutches."

The sides of the column rippled with light, and a hologram appeared. It showed a creature that looked much like the humans. But its limbs were longer, each holding an additional joint. The back of its head bulged out, tubelike flesh running into its back. It wore a suit of almost clothlike material, but unlike anything that existed.

Any who had studied history would recognise this. Though none had been seen physically in our combined histories, paintings and sculptures existed if these creatures. This was one of the Precursors, speaking to us. It's words were accented, but unmistakably Galactic Standard.

"Instead, we fall to a greater foe. Time itself. We are old, and have seen much. Our bodies are not failing us, but our souls are. This is the sunset of our race."

It's face bore unmistakable sorrow, clearly contemplating the end of its kind. But yet it stood proudly, against the weight it must be feeling.

"However, we know it is not the end of life. Even now, we see the barest building blocks of new life to replace us. I wish I could see what they would be like. It has been lonely, being the only race of our caliber. But it is not our fate.

In our place, we leave stores of our greatest works. They will last for far longer than us, a gift to the next generations of life. But to guard from ill intent, a genetic lock shall be placed upon these stores. Only the race bearing our genome shall be able to unlock these cases.

They will be brash. Their history will be like our, fraught with infighting and violence. But in the end, they will persevere, and grow to true custodians."

It's voice shifted, and to the majority of races it's words came out as nonsense. But the humans heard it loud and clear, as ancient parts of themselves woke up.

"You are our heirs. Your past actions are just that, in the past. What matters now is your future. Take our gifts, and use them well. Let the galaxy shout with joy at your arrival. And let any who threaten its life quake in terror before you."

The humans nodded, tears brimming within their eyes. The hologram winked out, and silence fell amongst the hall. Those who were assembled knew this was history in the making. This was the dawn of a new era.
