The Queen of Immolation had been a thorn in the kingdom's sides for too long. She was unpredictable, appearing randomly in a blaze of fire. Sometimes she would burn down a single building. Other times, entire towns were turned to ash. Without knowing where she would appear made taking her down close to impossible.

But we managed it. A lookout was placed in every town, with a totem. If she showed up, they would scratch the totem, which would alert our prepared force. Three would go in to distract, ten would evacuate the civilians, and seven would set up our trap.

She found her way to Riverstead, burning every fourth home for whatever reason. Our lookout sounded the alarm, and we teleported in. The Bait struck first, attacking with their seamless combos. The Cleaners moved fast, their work helped by the giant plumes of flame. On the Trappers, we scattered to the edges of town, taking out small crystal rods.

Each was plunged into the ground, undertaking a rapid growth. As they grew, they began to crackle with lightning, charging our trap. We held onto them, keeping it from activating whilst we had people inside. It didn't take long for the last civilians to get out, and each Bait member soon followed. As they left, we released the pillars, letting the trap take hold.

A large health bar appeared overhead, showing the Queen of Immolation's health. It began to decrease, as pained screams rang out. It was slow, a far crueller death than we had anticipated. But it was steady, and so we settled in to wait.

Days passed, with the bar going down further. We were certain of her death. It reached the end, the bar fading from view. We didn't cheer, instead feeling a weight lift from our shoulders. It was over. We had won.

To be certain we left the pillars up for another day, before deactivating them. We prepared to venture in, and retrieve her body. But as we did, the ground shook.

A new life bar appeared. But whereas the last was red, as it was for all living things, this was black. It came with a grating laugh, and a blast of heat.

"And when the good slay the cursed innocent, so shall the gates of oblivion release the first of ten destroyers."

Her body came into view over the empty town. It became wreathed in flames, flames that grew. She turned into a towering being of flame. Tendrils of flames sprouted from her, touching down in the town. Each buildings close by became consumed in an inferno, from the mere presence of the fire.

What had we done....
