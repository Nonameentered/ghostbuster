"Who dares summon me?!"

The words shook the room, accompanied by a wave of heat. A figure of pure muscle and bone stood in its centre, seven eyes looking in all directions. Two horns sprouted from either side of its head, with a third rising in front. It's mouth was filled with yellowed teeth, sharpened to a point. Thick arms hung low, oversized hands fit only to crush and break. It supported itself on four legs, sharp talons digging into the wooden floor.

"I summoned thee, Sraz'licdox, Scourge of the Flaming Wastes."

A young man stood outside of the circle, wearing worn jeans and a dark blue polo shirt. A few days worth of stubble peppered his chin, long black hair covering his head. His eyes were dull even in this moment, as though all excitement had been sucked from his life.

"What do you desire? Power? Fame? Money? Speak quick!"

The demon spoke in a practiced tongue. It had been summoned many times before, used to what humans craved. They wanted one of those three, or a mixture of them.

The young man gave a sigh, shaking his head.

"No thank you. What I desire is simple. All I want is a friend."

That gave Sraz'licdox pause. Throughout his entire time no-one had wished for something so simple. Yet simple as it was, it was hard to give.

"Mortal, that is a different wish. You should know we are bound to the Infernal Codex. Mental manipulation is forbidden."

The young man nodded, sighing again.

"I know. I didn't want you to make someone my friend. Its silly, but I was hoping you would be."

The demon had to think. Friends were something he was not used to. He had siblings, in the infinite reaches of the Realm of Pain. But he could not consider any a friend. He looked down at this mortal, the barest speck compared to his long existence. And for a moment, he felt a new connection.

"You... wish to be friends with a demon? A being of literal evil and chaos?"

The man nodded again.

"I have no others, so any would be good."

Sraz'licdox bowed his head.

"Then... it would be my pleasure to be your first."
