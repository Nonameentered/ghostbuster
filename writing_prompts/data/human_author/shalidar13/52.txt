"Your kind are unworthy. Rejoice, as we cleanse you."

A voice rumbled across Earth, all hearing it at the same time. All understood its words, though the voice spoke only once. It was followed by tearing sounds, as the fabric of reality was ripped apart, great swirling portals taking form. From with each, a different race stepped.

The first came from a vortex of vibrant green and brown. Their bodies were thick and serpentine, made of rippling muscle. Each had four thick arms, adorned with metal coverings. Their heads were pointed, a wide mouth full of grinding teeth gleaming below small, deepest eyes.

They laughed as they moved their hands, manipulating the ground beneath. It split beneath any unfortunate to attract their presence, before closing them with crushing force. When shots were fired they made it into a wall. Once the fire depleted, that wall was sent forth to crush. In their mocking, were learned their name. The Tirra.

The seconds portal was a chaotic grey void. From within, fly-like beings flew forth. Their bodies were squat, with eight limbs topped with clawed appendages. Compound eyes sat below a pair of proboscises, twitching in the air. They introduced themselves as the Flagrus

They called howling winds to harry whoever was unfortunate to be in their way. A few drew amusement from ripping air from lungs, suffocating their victims. Others saw fit to push more in, until organs burst. As militaries turned on them, they would effortlessly dodge, unnatural bursts of speed preventing them from being touched.

Finally, the third had a seemingly calm blue portal. But from it came creatures that looked anything but calm. A dozen tentacles supported an oversized head. Five eyes were spaced evenly around its circumference, ever watching. Their colouration constantly changed, no two sporting the same pattern.

Those who fled to the sea found themselves dragged out into its depths. These monsters, the Proco, seemed to pity whoever they found. Such deaths were often quick but terrifying, as they forced water into any orifice. Bullets and missiles were swallowed by rising columns, taken below out of harms way.

Our world began to collapse. These beings were beyond anything we could have hoped to fight. They used our planet against us, slowly but surely stamping out our kind. But as hope died, a new emotion took its place. Anger. How dare they decide to destroy us. How dare they ruin our world.

Unbeknownst to both us and them, their arrival had begun a chain reaction. Power that had lain dormant rose. It was called by its equals. But it did not belong to them. It rose in our chests, excited by our anger.

The rage we felt went deep enough to connect to this power. The first came to was a group farmers, seeing their crops destroyed. They stared down the Tirra, and a silent voice asked if they wanted revenge. Without a single doubt they said yes. And from their fingers spurted the final element.

Fire consumed the destroyers, charring them to bone before they could comprehend what had happened. They took to the skies, murderous intent in their hearts. The Flagrus tried to deny them flight. But they used no air to support, but instead a roaring column of flame.

As they travelled, so too did the wave of pyromantic release. It swept the globe, giving all who yet lived it equal mastery. The hate in our bones fanned it, and we struck back at the invaders.

They screamed as we pushed back. The Tirra burned from their holes, rock to magma beneath them. The Flagrus were scorched from the sky, wings melted by our intense heat. The Porro were boiled alive, the water they surrounded themselves with proving to be their downfall.

We chased them back, scouring them from our planet. But it wasn't enough. Some of us stayed back, to rebuild what we had lost. But many chose to step through the portals, and lay waste to whatever they could.

The element master had sought to destroy us. But instead, they had made us into master of destruction.
