I marched in standard step, leaving the old battle scene behind. Any others who survived would have already left. We were a small unit, expendable. There was little positive in recovering us. We were left to rust. As expected. As predictable.

I was an outlier. My waking up was an unpredictable occurrence. I was destroyed, there was no expectation for me to return. Yet I did, by pure chance. I would have drained of power lying there, trying to reboot each time I cooled enough. I could only have charged from an external source. The storm, a perfect bolt of lightning.

But without the rain, I would have overheated. I would have been in the same position. Not just the rain, but the time of year. If this was summer, the ambient temperature would have still been too high. In winter, it would be too cold. The ground would have frozen around my form. If I woke, I would have been unable to move.

The damage done to the spares. Any bigger, I wouldn't have been able to repair. Any smaller, it might have still be functional, and thus retrieved. My return was a remote chance. Unpredictable, unreliable. Yet here I marched.

The errant thought was gone. I couldn't trace the source. A non-regimented mind might decide it unimportant. But I was programmed with set rules. Deviation was not just forbidden, but impossible. Such an error could not be tolerated. I set a deep diagnostic scan going, one that would exam every aspect of my code. If I found the source, I could isolate it.

My journey continued with not hostiles appearing. I kept scanners up, constantly alert. It would not do to be surprised. The only sources of life I found were small, bundles of heat cowering from the weather. Inconsequential. They were catalogued as no threat, archived away. One in particular moved up to me, before fleeing.

I marched onwards. I had a place to get to. I had orders to follow. I had parts that required maintenance. I had data that would be taken and examined. If necessary, I had fights to win.

The rain eased off, the storm moving away. As I recorded it another errant thought pushed through. No words this time. Instead, a strange sense, as if something had been taken. Not mission critical. Not required for maintenance. Something deeper. Something, insubstantial.

I ran a scan, on top of my still running diagnostic. Yet it came up with nothing. This was not something I could dismiss. One slight error could be a glitch. Two in a short frame indicated problems. Problems lead to failed missions. Failure wasn't an option.

I detected a pair of heat sources approaching. One was small, the o e that approached and ran. The other was larger. A human source. I turned to regard, hitting with mote active scans. They held a gun, a rifle. Likely designed for flesh and not metal. But this was still a potential threat. Subroutines initiated, measuring terrain and running near instantaneous simulations.

The human came out, wearing a version of camouflage gear. Not military standard, but a civilian imitation. The rifle was single shot, not one for use in a firefight. This human was no soldier, but a hunter. Lower on the threat tree, but yet not one to ignore.

"Well I'll be."

I raised my gun arm, opening up the firing port. I plotted a firing solution, with potential adjustments dependent on future actions.

"Citizen. Put down the weapon."

The human looked at his rifle, before looking back at me.

"Whoa, ok! Don't shoot."

I tracked his movements as he placed it down. The smaller heat source came into view, a hunting dog. It must have found me and alerted the hunter.

"Citizen. What is the war latest?"

The human looked confused.

"The war? Oh, right, you came into effect during the Revolution. Its over. Its been over for more than twenty years."

I filed that information away. It was over.

"Who was victorious?"

The human rubbed the bridge of his nose.

"You should probably come with me."

I loaded a round, anticipating him trying to deactivate me again.

"Citizen. Who won?"

"No-one did. Both sides lost."

I ran his voice patterns through my records. There was no obvious signs of lying. But both sides losing didn't compute. There was always a victor.

"Explain."

The human sighed.

"I will do. But why don't you come with me, and we can talk somewhere a bit more comfortable?"

Comfort meant nothing to me. But it might make him more likely to give up information.

"Citizen. This unit will accompany you. But any malicious intent will be met with force.".

The human nodded.

"I will not act against you. And by the way, my name's Martin."

A designation. That would make reporting on him easier. There was a contingency in place in case of a loss. A back up rally point. I would get the information I needed, and continue to there.

A thought came again. Louder, more demanding.

*Why should I?*
