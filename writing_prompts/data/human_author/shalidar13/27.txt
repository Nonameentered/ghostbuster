"I must say, it is a surprise to see people at this hour in my collection."

I stood at the top of a grand staircase, looking into the hall below. Three people looked up at me in shock, wearing dark clothing. Bags on their backs told me all I needed to know about their current plans, with each one clealry stuffed tight. I could call them out immediately, but were was the fun in that?

"We... um... we really wanted to see what you had on display here."

I smiled at the one on the left. His voice shook a little, fumbling at the start of his lie. But he pulled through admirably.

"I'm sure you did. And it's not that you wanted to take my reagents is it? Do you have a good explanation for that?"

They backed away slowly. I shook my head, snapping a finger. As I did my security activated, slamming doors and windows tight. Glowing blue chains shimmered into view over the top, sealing each exit tight.

"Now now. I'm sure you have a good reason. Tell me."

The right one looked at their fellows, before spitting out undeniable truth.

"You're rich, you can buy more stuff. We aren't, and need to take what we can when we can."

I gave a small nod in her direction.

"Ah, truth. I do so live that. In fact I have spent my life discovering old truths. Not that you would understand it of course."

The man on the left jabbed the others in the side. He looked up at me, fear rising in his voice.

"Look... I'm sorry. We will... we will leave them, if you can please let us go."

I covered my mouth with a hand, tapping one finger against my cheek as though thinking.

"Hmmmm. No. No I don't think so. I have a different proposal. If you help me with some research, I will let you go."

He glanced at his friend's. Seeing them nod frantically he peered up and me.

"Yes, OK. What would you have us do?"

I smiled, pulling out a pendant from my neck. It was made of a crows skull, old and well used. I tapped it, focusing on one of my display units.

"Well, I have been waiting for a good opportunity to study the hunting tactics used by the classic Tyrannosaurus Rex. I'm sure you won't mind being the prey."

My display of Tyrannosaurus Rex bones shifted. Ectoplasm bubbled up from the base, rising up to coat them. It made links between them, letting the bones move as they did in life. The trio looked at the glow in a panic, before staring at me.

"No, wait, please!"

They shouted, and I shrugged.

"You agreed to this. Tell you what, if you survive until the sun is fully risen, I will stop the experiment and let you leave."

With a grin I watched as the ectoplasm climbed up the pair of skeleton's necks. Ghostly fire burst to life in their eyes, and I looked to my horrified intruders.

"I would suggest you run."
