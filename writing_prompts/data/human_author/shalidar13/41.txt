"Ms Ilesford."

I groaned. Of course. Every single time I got a day off, or had to do something important, they came for me. The Guardians seemed to have a knack for arriving at the wrong time. I was on thin ice at work, and really just needed a week to relax.

I looked up from my morning coffee, hardly surprised to see Nocta in my dining room. His trenchcoat rippled from his shadow walking, the tight black suit beneath preventing easy grip. He wore a serious expression as always, with an eyepiece over his right eye.

"Nocta. Really? You found yet *another* piece of alien technology?"

His face didn't move. I groaned again. If they were at least a bit more chatty when they took me I wouldn't mind so much. But he was deadly serious. I'm pretty sure any sign of joy would mean he was losing his powers,or was an imposter.

"You need to come with us."

I sighed, shaking my head.

"And if I say no?"

He took a step towards me, eyes trying to bore a hole through me.

"We can make you help us. You know this Ms Ilesford."

That was true. One of their people could persuade you into doing whatever you wanted. Silver tongue was kept under close watch because of that, though she could only do so when touching you. I was grateful for that limitation, having been forced by her before.

"And yet, I rarely get adequately compensated for my time. Sure, you put it good words for me at work, so I don't lose my job, but I still lose out on promotions and such."

He reached out to me, unmoved.

"You can discuss that later. For now, we need to go."

I smirked as his hand passed through my body, gratified to see the look of surprise on his face.

"Like it? It's something I made after looking st that last piece of tech you found. I call it the Phasing Shield."

He glowered at me, trying to get s hold of me to shadow walk. I just sighed, tapping the watch on my wrist.

"You can't get me through it."

He gave a huff, calming himself down.

"You don't want to do this Ms Ilesford. You don't want to get in our bad side."

I glared at him in return.

"Do what? Stop being kidnapped? I would quite like to stop experiencing what it is like to be Princess Peach thank you very much. Besides, if I really wanted to do that, I think my start would be a little more impressive don't you think?"

Nocta rubbed the bridge of his nose.

"I guess. So what will it take for you to come with me?"

I smiled.

"Thats a good start. I'm fed up of being an on call volunteer. You want my help? I want a contract with adequate compensation, work hours, and holidays. Plus back pay for all those times you called me out."

He gave a sigh.

"I can't promise any of those things."

I took another sip of coffee, letting him stew for a moment.

"I know. The board will have to decide. But those are my terms. You want my help, pay me for it."

He nodded, vanishing into a shadow. I sighed, feeling tension ease from my shoulders. That was the first real test of my shield. Thank goodness it worked.
