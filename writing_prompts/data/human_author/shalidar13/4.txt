"Mayday, Mayday. Any Allied ships, please respond. We are under attack. Two Fal Carriers. We are a civilian vessel. We request immediate assistance. Mayday, Mayday."

The call was broadcast to an empty void. The last hope of a terrified crew. The Fal had been slowly sweeping through the galaxy, enslaving all before them. Save for one race, any the found were forced to feed their tyrannical machine.

Their message was responded to with jeers and laughs, as the Fal casually sprayed fire at them. They piloted large rectangular ships, delibrately angular. The haulers shields were growing dimmer, the generator barely holding against the onslaught. It was inevitable in their eyes now. They would be taken, never ti see their families again.

"C\--e in, we \---- you. Please \----- name and \------ for \----uring here."

A new signal came through. It was weak, with words dropping. But the captain of the vessel, a Tyrinra leapt to answer. Her sinuous body was snakelike, scales in spiralling lines of pink and yellow. A pair of arms seized the edge of her console, a central one manipulating the helm. With a flick of a switch she hailed the incoming signal.

"This is the Open Maw, I am Fyrnor. Please help us, we are a civilian vessel."

There was a momentary whine, before the signal came through much clearer.

"We read you Open Maw. How much longer can you hold out?"

She looked over to one of the few crew, a delicate Gomma. Their body was thin, an exoskeleton providing necessary support against the harsh reality of space. Its many eye stalks looked at a mass of screens, taking in more information than anyone else could handle.

"Shem, how long do we have?"

They flapped their thin wings, a nervous tic as they ran some calculations.

"Maybe four micro flaps."

She nodded, opening her mouth to pass it on.

"Four micro flaps? Ah, so just over two standard minutes. Understood, continue your bearing. On my mark, turn to heading eighty-four core ward. Copy?"

Fyrnor blinked in surprise. Shoving aside her slight misgivings she nodded, getting ready. She could tell whoever this was was used to giving orders, and had more experience than her.

"Understood."

She could hear an underlying amusement in their voice, before the line fell silent.

"Don't worry, you'll be fine."

They continued to flee, the carriers happily harrying them. Fyrnors misgivings grew, as the line remained silent. As they drew close to the end of their time, it started up again.

"Turn, now."

She didn't hesitate, twisting her helmstick. The Open Maw groaned as it did so, not designed for sharp turns. As she moved, she noticed a flash from ahead, as a new ship appeared. It had a long, slender look, its bow bristling with weapons. As she moved her ship, she saw it release a bright blue light, one that burned to see.

It was met with a gasp. She spun an eye to look at Shem, who seemed to be watching their pulse scanner. They turned a stalk to her, voice strangled in shock.

"Both carriers... they're gone."

"Indeed they are, and you are welcome."

The voice came again. This time It was over the intercom, rather than her channel.

"Apologies for hacking in, it helps us to hear exactly what's going on. Is anyone hurt, or any severe damage?"

Fyrnor looked at her blank video screen.

"We will do a run down. But can I see who just saved us?"

There was a genuine laugh, and her screen received an incoming hail. With a click she answered it, revealing their saviours. A primate with dark hide looked at her, a lonely looking mop of fur on its hear. A pair of small eyes crinkled, as it bared its teeth. It matched the description of something, but she couldn't out her finger on it.

"Sorry about that. The name's Gavin, its a pleasure to make your acquaintance."

She gave a pair of slow winks, one with each eye.

"Thank you Gavin, truly. I don't recognise your species though, I hope you don't mind me saying."

He laughed again, tilting his head back.

"Oh of course not. I'm a human."

Human. That was it. The one race the Fal hasn't enslaved, instead burning all remnants of them.

"A human?! But I thought you were extinct!"

His face changed, dropping.

"Almost. We almost were. The Fal saw to that. Luckily they didn't do a good job of it though. I can guess a few of your questions, but let me preempt some. No, I'm not the last. We have been hiding within the Hyperway. And yes, we are coming back."

He fiddled with something off screen. A moment later both hers and Shem's consoles showed a galactic map.

"I'm part of the Rapid Response. We were meant to be waiting a cycle before revealing, but our orders are also to help before if needed."

The map showed the Allied controlled systems in green, with the red of Fal systems spreading around. As they watched, blue specks appeared, heading for the contested borders.

"The Fal thought us gone. But now we are back, and have a score to settle."
