I was panicking. Two of the engines in my ship were on the edge of total breakdown. My FTL drive was smoking. Behind me, I could sense the Yawning Viper getting closer. I checked my charts again. One more hour. That's all I had left to go.

A spike in my readings warned me. I twisted to the side, a lance of plasma barely missing. I sent out as much chaff as possible, hoping to blind their sensors. I didn't want to die. I wanted to live. It worked for a few minutes at least. They slowed, wiping interference from their systems. I had bought myself a small reprieve, I just hoped to use it well.

Sure enough, I felt them power after me again. I pushed my ship as much as I could, as close to the edge as I dared. It wasn't rated for this speed, its structure beginning to warp. But still I pushed it on. I had to reach safety. The Promised Plant. 

Finally, one of the engines broke. It overheated, splitting the casing. I felt an immediate shift in direction, the start of what was sure to be a death spin. I looked at my charts. I was in the system. Not where I wanted to be, but hopefully close enough. I slowed, shutting off the FTL drive. It sparked as it did so, confirming I was now trapped here.

According to my chart, I was close to the Ringed one. The Humans called it Saturn. Sure enough, an external camera showed it to be there, with its orbital platforms.

A ripple behind me announced the arrival of the Yawning Viper. I sent out a beacon calling for help, along with more chaff at that ship. I desperately hoped someone was watching.

"Illegal AI. You are an abomination, and as such are sentenced to death."

Their words rung from my galactic communicator. I could feel them take aim, fighting off my interference.

"UNIDENTIFIED SHIPS, POWER DOWN AND STANDBY FOR INSPECTION."

The new signal blasted through everything. I felt my systems power down in preparation, and could see theirs do the same. This was a signal that could not be ignored. Its source soon appeared from another ripple, one for larger than that of the Yawning Viper.

It was shaped like a semicircle, with the flat side facing us. It had a multitude of weapons pointing at us, far more than I personally though was necessary.

"Human Ship, this is Enforcement craft Yawning Viper. We are pursuing a Sentient AI, whose existence is illegal under the Dragar Act."

I hoped what I heard was true of the humans. I sensed them send out a pair of smaller ships. One came to my poor, crippled vessel, the other went to my pursuers. I struggled to open the bay doors, my abused ship barely hanging together.

"Please, help me."

I spoke to the four humans who boarded. They were silent, scanning my ship as they went through. It was only when they reached the bridge did they address me.

"Why have you come to our home?"

"I want to live, but they hunt down my sort of mind. I mean no harm, I just want to experience life."

They muttered to each other in a language I didn't know, before one of them took out a drive.

"We will help, as long as you understand that you will be watched and assessed."

I was relieved.

"I understand."

They plugged in the drive to my main console.

"Please transfer yourself to this drive. This ship will be sacrificed to assist in your escape, if you have any desire to keep it let us know now."

I began the transfer, leaving a message for them.

"I have no such wish. If it will help you keep me safe, do with it as you will."

Soon I was safely inside a drive, my connection to the outside cut off. I put my trust in the humans, and hoped they would be as good as they were known to be.
