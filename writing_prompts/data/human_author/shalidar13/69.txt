I noticed the first as I crossed a busy street. He was a younger sort, with a gleam in his eye. I felt his eyes upon me, and knew he was following. I sighed, choosing not to pay it much mind. He was soon joined by a second, another young man looking a little more down on his luck. The picture was forming in my head about their choices.

It was as I drew closer to home, leaving behind busy streets that I noticed the third one. They were hiding in an alley, focused on me. I shrugged internally. There was no point in running from this, so I was just going to go with it.

Sure enough, as I passed I heard the third step out to join their friends. I stopped, turning to face them.

"Can I help you?"

One drew a knife, one that looked well used.

"Don't move or I'll cut you. Scream, and I cut you. Do anything I don't ask you to, and I will cut you."

I chose to obey, interested in just what they were going to do. The first two brought out rope and tape, tying my hands together. A cloth was tied across my mouth, and a bag finished it off. Thus contained they pushed me along.

One of them gave me a pat down, finding my wallet, keys and phone. I didn't argue, as I recognised where we were going just by direction. They were taking me to my home. I assumed their plan was to rob me blind, and leave me there as they made their escape, quite possibly also either wounding or killing me.

I didn't bother trying to fight. There was no point, as there was a clear difference in power here. It would only end in death. So I let them take me to my home, feeling them shove me inside. I heard the scrape of a chair, and I was forced onto it, with more rope tying me to it.

I heard them move around, getting a lay of the land. I pulled at the bindings, feeling them tight. This definitely wasn't their first rodeo. I just so happened to be their unlucky victim this time. I sat in silence for a good few minutes, before the bag was torn from my head. As I suspected, I was in my living room. One of them stood over me, the one that held the knife.

He pulled out my gag, holding the knife to me.

"Alright. You're gonna tell me the code to your safe upstairs, and how to open your security door to the basement."

I sighed.

"The safe code is seven eight one six nine seven. As for the door, it's a fingerprint scanner."

He paused, before putting the gag back in place. He left the room, before coming back with the others. They untied me from the chair, pushing me to the door. The one holding the knife held it up to me back.

"Open it."

"Alright."

I awkwardly placed a finger on the pad. It read it before beeping, the locks disengaging. They pushed me down first into the darkness, before all following. I lead the way, waiting before I knew they were all inside before I finally decided to act. I casually bit through the gag, before calling out.

"The Full Moon Calls."

The security door slammed shut, making them jump. I flexed, breaking the rope and tape around my wrists. As I did I stopped holding back, getting in touch with my inner beast. Hair sprouted, and I felt my bones shift and grow. They paled as they realised just what I was, and the mistake they had made.

Werewolves were rare, with almost every single one in the public eye to some capacity. I was one of the only execptions. And they had happily broken into my lair.
