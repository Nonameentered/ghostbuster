"How's my little monster this morning?"

I gurgled at the Master, as he opened up my cart. I was in my preferred form of a chest, watching him through my hidden eyes. He pulled out a piece of meat, dangling it in the air. My attention was on it. I was hungry.

"Good to see you are awake. Here, breakfast."

He gently tossed it to me. I opened my lid, whipping out a tendril to catch it and pull it inside. It was raw and fresh, my favourite sort of meal. Thinking for a moment, I changed my front to one of those masks they loved, choosing the form with the mouth curling upwards.

"Excellent. You did well last night, that's for sure. We're looking at doing a new act soon, so come out as soon as you're ready."

He left out into the morning sun. I let the meat dissolve inside of me, filling me with its goodness. Once the last trace was gone I moved, growing out two large tendrils. It was easier to move in my natural form, but the Actors were put off by it. So I made do with shifting whatever form I chose to help.

As I did, I considered myself. At this size, I was comfortable. But I knew I was getting a bit too big. As good as it was for the props the Master wanted, I couldn't do the small ones any more. But then again, at this point I was close to budding.

An idea came to mind. The buds would likely be like me. If I could teach them, they could join me. A family of mine, all part of the Act. I liked the idea of it. But first I would have to check with the Master. He liked me, that much I knew. I wanted to stay with him, and that meant doing what I was told. It was either this, or hunt Metal Ones. And Metal Ones hurt.

Set in my idea, I pulled myself into the sun. Around me I could see the Actors milling around. Some looked at me with concern, the new ones. The older ones, who I had seen for a long time, just gave me a smile and a wave. They were a bit more comfortable with me.

I waved at one, the Lead. She was the first one to trust me, besides the Master. And now she would happily perform climbing on me. At times I wondered what she would taste like, but they were few and far between. I much preferred her alive. She often had the best treats.

I soon found the Master, sitting by their fire. They were talking with the Maker, discussing the stage. I moved my way determinedly to them. I'm.sure they would like my idea. It would make the Makers job easier.
