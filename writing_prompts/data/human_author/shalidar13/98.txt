"Damnit! Helvax, are you ok?"

I winced at the loud voice issuing from our Paired Stones. Instantly the beast I was hiding from turned, it's crimson eyes focused on my position. I felt it lumber towards me, and I ran.

"Teilo, now is not the time!"

The monster roared, chasing after me. I let loose a stream of curses as I ran. It was a beast of nightmares, borne from the night terrors of an entire city. Something I boasted many of in my army. But this one was different. Its mind was shielded from me, by some other meddling. If I had time I could break it. But this thing wasn't giving me time.

"Sorry! Did you corrupt a Divine Sentry?"

I shook my head, even though he couldn't see me.

"No, you know I don't meddle with them! Why?"

I heard a curse, as I dodged around a wall. It roared as it claws hit ancient stonework, the halls of the ruins too narrow for it to use its true potential.

"Well, I'm currently running from one that seems to want to kill me."

"Wait... can't you talk to them?"

I could hear the frustration in his voice.

"Normally yes, but this one's thoughts are blocked!"

I felt cold.

"Someone is trying to remove us."

I slowed a little in my head long pursuit. With quick muttered words I slapped down a few trap sigils. They would hurt it a bit, but I couldn't easily kill something made of my own power base.

"I say this because I'm currently running from a Dreamhunter. One that I can't dominate. It makes sense, send monsters we can't easily defeat against us."

Teilo's voice was full of the haunting realisation.

"They have no idea what that would do."

I gave a mirthless chuckle.

"Or they know too well. They might want to cause chaos."

"Or that."

I heard a sigh.

"I'm safe for a moment. Clearly the best thing to do is try and deal with each others issue first. Then we can investigate."

I could heard the occasional thud, as my traps set off one by one.

"Definitely. Where are you?"

"In the heart of the Direen Plains. You?"

I thought. That was very far. Getting there with this in pursuit would be dangerous, but doable.

"The Shattered Mountains. I'm coming to you."

Muttering came to me, as Teilo thought.

"We'll meet each other. Head to Garens Last Stand."

I nodded. That would certainly be easier.

"Alright. See you in a day or so."

"Agreed. Just whatever you do, don't die."

I gave a barking laugh. The thuds were very close now.

"I don't plan to."
