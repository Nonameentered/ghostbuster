"What's the latest?"

I spoke through the door of the Monitoring Office. It was one of many, spread all across the world. It was manned by those of our kind who were the more pacifistic sort. Dryads and constructs worked in tandem, using both nature and machines to keep a watch over the world.

"Quiet for now. Please come in as well."

I smiled at the elf in charge, perched on her high chair. With her permission granted I stepped in, looking across the floor with interest. I could hear the constant buzz of conversation, as they spoke with each other about what they saw.

"I don't trust this. Its been too long since the last attempt. Something must be brewing."

Grionlia gave me a nod. She scratched one of her pointed ears, thinking.

"You and me both. They might be finished of course, deciding our planet is too much effort. But... my gut tells me they are making preparations."

I sighed, rubbing my head. I thought life was hard all those centuries ago, bring a newly turned. Having to feed and remain hidden, but also planning for the future. Now, I wished for those times again.

"Good thing we are too. I've been speaking with as many other Response teams as I can. They agree something is off. But they are using this time to train further, and make upgrades to their equipment."

She nodded, picking up a scroll.

"I'm glad to hear it. How are the dwarves and gnomes getting on with the recovered technology? Any luck in reverse engineering it?"

I smiled, flashing a fang.

"They say they have. Apparently they've worked out the base of their shielding. If all goes well, we will be given our own personal versions soon. Well, the weaker ones of us first. I know the lycans are low on the list."

She rolled her eyes, giving a small shake of her head.

"Did you have anything to do with that?"

I laughed.

"I'm flattered you think I would be able to do it. No, as amusing as it is for old rivals to be lower on the list, they have their rapid healing. It will hurt them sure, but without silver being used in those laser weapons they love so, they can't exactly kill them."

Grionlia pursed her lips, returning to her paperwork.

"Thats a fair point. Anyway, I think that's enough chat for now, don't you have somewhere to be?"

I shrugged, looking at the time.

"In a bit. The sun's still just barely up. We're going on a training excursion. But I will have a direct channel back, just incase."

She nodded again, her attention already devoured by her reports.

"Ok, have fun."

I shook my head, leaving her be. It amused me sometimes, the current state of affairs. Our races working together to save the world, without the majority even knowing it. What would they think if they knew their monsters were also their defenders? I'm sure it would be interesting. Though at some point they would find out. That much I knew.
