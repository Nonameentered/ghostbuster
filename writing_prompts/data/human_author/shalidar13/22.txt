It was one of the great spells left behind by Drinsvan the Noble. In an effort to preserve life and joy he wove globe spanning spells, affecting all life. The Boon of Good Health meant illness was a rare thing indeed, only serious cases ever showing symptoms. The Bountiful Boon ensured crops grew tall and healthy, ensuring food for all. And the Boon of Preservation gave us the sight into our own lives, when our end might come.

I was assisting in a ritual with one of the professors. As a poor student, I seized every opportunity to make money, a teat subject being one. He had proposed an idea to temporarily loop the natural mana in a person's body. According to his theory it either cause a temporary power boost, or have a permanent increase in potential.

I was more than willing to assist. At worst I would be paid to stand around whilst something failed. At best, I would become better for a while, something I could really use. My magic was average at best, but many roles wanted more than I could give.

He began to chant, as I stood in a chalk circle. Crystal and metal fragments were arranged around me, beginning to hover at his words. I kept an eye on my probability as I watched them start to orbit me, crackling with power.

It stayed low, something I was comfortable with. Any higher than point three I would say, to stop it from continuing. But it was still in the point zero area, a comforting sight. The chance of this killing me was low, which I could handle.

As he stopped chanting, I watched the number change. This was the dangerous part, as he stopped feeding into his spell, and letting it build. It meant it was past the point of no return. If he tried to stop it, all this power would have to go somewhere. All that would probably end up with bad things happening.

But to my surprise, my number decreased. It reached zero, something that was rare, as there was always a remote chance of death. But it didn't stop. It continued to fall into negative figures, an impossibility.

I wanted to speak, but my gut said not to. This Boon had never been wrong in the centuries since its creation. The chance of it happening right now was remote at best. Besides, speaking up would mean he would try to stop the spell, and that would certainly end badly.

The ritual pulled on my mana, drawing it out. It fed into the feedback loop, drawing and entering into me. I felt a strange burning sensation, as if my spirit was on fire. But it wasn't painful. It felt... good in a way. My probability dropped, until it stabilised at -0.98965.

The burning grew. I felt more and more power cycling through me. It was incredible, far more than I had ever seen before. Feeling it was indescribable. The ritual had not only worked, it had exceeded beyond his wildest dreams.

*You wield impressive strength.*

The whisper filled my ears. A face wavered before me, its mouth in a faint smile.

*Such power in the hands of a mortal... no... not mortal no longer.*

It wavered close, as the ritual rose towards its completion.

*Welcome to the halls of immortality. I will see you soon.*

The ritual finished, the last shreds of power flooding into me. I gasped, falling to my knees. As I breathed in short gasps, I managed to spit out words at the space the face had existed.

"What... was... that...?"
