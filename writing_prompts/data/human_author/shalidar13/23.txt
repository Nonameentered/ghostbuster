"Please, please cry."

I was at my wit's end. I had only been a mother for a few days, but already it felt like an eternity. My beautiful baby had been perfect at first. He fed well, moving and sleeping with little issue. But then he got sick. The Crib Pox they said, a rare illness that affected the newly born.

Most shrugged through it with ease. Milk, warmth and rest were all they needed. But in my case, he went from bad to worse. His breaths wheezed, his little body ice cold. I feared he would not survive. I knew he would be better when he found the strength to cry. But as time wound on he was silent.

"A mother's plea, is that what I hear?"

I gasped, looking to my right. A figure had crept up beside me, presence completely sealed. They wore an outfit of straps, barely covering them up. Their skin was deep red, a pair of horns curling from their scalp. I looked at the demoness beside me, a mixture of fear and dread in my chest.

"Who are you?"

She looked at me, grinning. Her eyes were purple, black blood vessels winding through. Her teeth flashed gold, each slightly pointed.

"You can call me Andresa. Your child is sick is he not?"

Her words seemed to curl through the air, wreathed in flame. I gave a nod, picking up my dear boy. He shivered in my grip, even as I held him tight to my chest.

"Can you help him?"

Her eyes flashed, and she gave a nod.

"I can, and I will. But," she held up a finger "it will come at a price."

I shivered myself, anticipating what would come. Demons craved souls. She would want mine in return for my sons life. A cruel offer, but one I knew I would take.

"You want my soul?"

Andresa laughed, reaching out with a clawed hand to pat my cheek.

"Oh no, I require nothing like that. No, I will save your son,but in return, I will take his humanity."

I felt cold, as her offer settled in my heart.

"His... humanity?"

She grinned, nodding.

"Yes... he will grow up big and strong, with the blood of demons in his veins. He will become a man you can be proud of. And after twenty five years, I will return."

I narrowed my eyes at her.

"What do you mean you will return?"

She grinned again, licking her lips.

"To collect my groom of course. That, or he wastes away here and now. Your choice."

I felt tears spring up in my eyes. It was a cruel choice. Either let him die, or choose a damnable fate for him. I wished I could say no. I wished I was string enough to let him go. But tears ran down my face, as I chose his future for him.

"Ok... please, save my son."

She sucked in a cheek, biting into it. Her face showed no pain, even as blood welled between her lips. Andresa leant down to my boy, pulling away a blanket to see his face. She gave a kiss on his lips, leaving a blood smear that his tongue lapped it.

"There. It is done."

I looked at her, feeling horror at what had happened. But my gazemoved as I heard a sound I had be praying to hear, as he gave an enormous cry. I saw his colour filled cheeks, as his new strength fought back the illness. I looked up to thank her, only to discover an empty room again.

I sat down with my son, gently rocking him. A thought came to me, as I smiled at my boys renewed vigour.

*What have I done?*
