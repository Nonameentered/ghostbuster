Being born is something most are unable to recall. It is a fairly traumatic experience, going from a warm cocoon to a cold and harsh world. The burning of air as it first hits the lungs. Sounds hitting newly formed eardrums. It is a horrific experience.

It is one I have seen hundreds of times. All from different times. Growing up I never remember, a small blessing I guess. But when I become an adult, the old me finds me. I pass on my mind and memories, granting me the ability to remember everything. From that I know my true position, one I have held for centuries. I am War.

But despite that knowledge, I am never the same. I retain the personality I had growing up. So whilst I am the same, I am also different people. Some would have seen the world destroyed from the memories of the former versions. Memories of the formers would call out for destruction on the current events. But I could not do it alone. I needed to be in agreement with the others.

I always know where the others are. No matter how far, I can pinpoint their location. I can tell when the title is going to be passed on. I know who the new bearers are when they are born, even though they themselves do not. Together, we make up a ticking clock. If we choose so, humanity will end.

Lately, I was becoming angry. The world was falling, and we hadn't done anything. Leaders were weakening, becoming spineless self-serving parasites over what they should be. They ought to help those beneath, not crush them.

Famine bid me calm. She said there was yet good and strength in the many. They could rise, and set the course back to order. She kept her aura in check as much as possible, trying to ensure they could be fed.

Pestilence reluctantly agreed with my view that things needed a shove. But he did not want to set it off, bring a more timid version of himself. He would support either path, his own desires hidden.

Death, mightiest of us all, stared me down. Her wizened form reminded me of the images of us, with her tightly drawn skin. She was always the leader of us, and we knew she had greater knowledge than our own. We only knew our purpose, and that is all we needed. She knew of the time before, and our creation.

She told us that destruction was a final resort. When there was no hope of redemption, then we should act. But for now, we should shake the world. Make them remove the chaff, and grow better than they were.

Pestilence was tasked with a scare, to remind humanity of compassion. He made a small plague, one that would be easily vaccinated against, but enough that they should remember their empathy.

Famine would stand by. Her power would likely cause the sickness to grow stronger, if the ill could not feed themselves to survive.

I would remind them of how destructive war was. I whispered in the mind of one particularly bad leader, pushing them into a fight they were truly unprepared for. Many a soul was slain from my action. But u hoped that from this, more would be saved.

And Death watched, and judged. She would be the final decider in this effort. We didn't really want to annihilate the world, as once our purpose was done we too would be lost.

But we were ready to do it anyway.
