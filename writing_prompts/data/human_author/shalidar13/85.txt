Being in my line of work, I was forgiven for certain eccentricities. If I had to attend somewhere, I would find myself a perch as high up as I could. For every weapon I handed over, I would have another hidden on my body. I seldom ate food at a banquet, choosing to bring my own instead.

Some called me rude for those manners. The brave tried to get on my good books. The foolish tried to butter me up. The wise kept their distance from me and my actions. I knew the Captain of the Guard had a dislike for me, as I ran circles around his men. But we worked well together, as I made mockery of his patrols, he would rework them to make a more secure net.

There was only one who I obeyed. The one whom I served willingly, even if much of the time I had no work to do. I was the King's Hidden Blade. The Royal Assassin.

Lately I had little to do. My last job had been to remove an upstart noble, who had tried to make a revolution. Naturally I couldn't have that, leading to my knife being buried in his chest. I had left my calling card, a pure black sovereign coin, in his hand, before returning. The last time my skills were needed.

But I had to keep myself fit and ready. So I prepared a nice spread for an indulgence, a nice tea. But I couldn't have it any place could I?

I searched for the perfect spot. The main hall? Too obvious. Too boring. Though I did like the look of one of the candlesticks. I took it with no-one being the wiser, even though I didn't try.

I peered into the concubine room. They enjoyed my stories, the three of them eagerly listening when I came by. But again, it wasn't the right place this time. I did pause at some of the new jewellery they had. A couple caught my eye, and were caught in my fingers. I wasn't going to keep them, but I liked the look of them.

I looked outside, seeing it rain. This made me smile, having tea outside would definitely be worth it. I looked upwards, seeing some gargoyles leaning out into the sky. They were practically begging to be used. I made sure my bag was secure, and I began the climb.

It was cold and wet. The wind didn't want to let up, buffeting me. It would be suicide to climb this in such weather. Unless you had my level of experience. I scaled the wall with ease, laughing to myself the entire time. This was perfect.

In short order I reached the summit, climbing onto the gargoyle's back. I carefully set down my pack, and took off my cloak. Using the ornamentation, I tied it to make a nice shelter. With it there, I unpacked my bag, setting up the candlestick and lighting it. The necklaces were dangled from the gargoyles fingers, glittering prettily. My teapot glowed as I activated the boiling runes, and made myself a nice brew.

It was time for tea.
