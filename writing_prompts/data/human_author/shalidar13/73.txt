"What is this?"

I spoke in an unfamiliar voice. I had closed my eyes in a broken town centre, surrounded by bodies and fire. The buildings were ruined, but I had held them back long enough. I had given myself in sacrifice to protect them as long as I could, the only one I was able to do.

But now I was in a strange place. I could tell I lay on a stone slab, with chains criss-crossing my body. I could feel pulsing energy from below, from what I assumed were runic symbols. Similar ones were carved into this bodies flesh, ones I knew instinctively held me here.

"Ah, the experiment was a success. Welcome back to the land of the living. Tell me, what is your name?"

A calm voice echoed around the room, unfamiliar to me. It had an accent I did not recognise, as though they spoke with the tip of their tongue.

"I am Gregorvir. Where am I? What have you done?"

I heard footsteps, but could not see the source still. The voice came again, pleased with itself.

"Ah, Gregorvir. You are currently within the arcane laboratory of Ferina."

I strained against the bindings, even with my strength being sapped by the runes beneath me. The voice changed, becoming sorrowful.

"I had to interrupt your deserved rest, for that I am sorry. However, I did not do it purely for my own research. I need the help of a great warrior, for we have none. But selfishly I chose the selfless."

I strained again, feeling the symbol below struggle to hold me. With its sapping me, I could tell this body was far stronger than my original. The name of the place meant little to me. Eventually I relented, and I felt a desire come to me. I had died. I knew I had been at peace, even if the memories of the place were lost to me. I wanted to go back.

"If I help, will you let me go back?"

The voice owner appeared, a middle aged woman, thin and tired. She wore a thick coat covered in burn marks and stains.

"If you help save my people, then yes I will."

I didn't know what was going on. But at this point I didn't care. I just wanted to return to my peace. It seemed to me this was the easiest method to do so.
