I kept myself hidden. My location was deliberately lost, only myself knowing the moon I resided upon. I had a burning planet below me, one that was in the stage of forming. I had a few drones that I sent out to communicate, though they would warp to systems to send out whatever messages I wanted.

I was hidden for a reason. I used to be human, but none would consider that my heritage now. A simple accident in decommissioning a military bio-lab. I was infected with a parasite, one that would convert the host into a living weapon. But it wasn't perfect, as I kept my mind. But my body, that was another story.

I changed. My skin turned black, with a shiny carapace initially place. I grew a tail, one of pure muscle and sharpened point. My limbs grew longer, with a greater strength than I could imagine. My head became oblong, my tongue converting into a mouth, with my original mouth no longer able to eat.

I knew if I was found out, I would be studied. I used the time of my transformation to set up my base. I obscured records, deleted all evidence of my actions. I escaped into the unknown, into solitude. I didn't expect to cure myself. Such a transformation as this couldn't be reversed. So I chose to study it, and see if I could use it to make new treatments for others. If I could isolate parts, I could break through safer genetic adjustments, ones that normal people could use.

Fate however had other plans. I knew when the pirates entered this system. Barring my drones, they were the first to warp here in a year. I watched as they wandered the system, inspecting each planet and their various moons.

My gut to me they weren't hunting for me. They were doing what I did, finding the right place to make a base. In this system, there was only one place. The place I had set up my med-station and biolab. Sure enough, their ship came overhead, and a shuttle was deployed to my home.

I shut everything down, bar my meat vat. Starting the growing process again would take time, and being that I could only eat meat, I didn't really want to waste it. Once it was all off, I hid in the shadows. I was thankful for my new form this time. It easily blended into the dark. I found it easy to climb up to the ceiling, instincts I had grow with this form keeping my movements near silent.

Soon enough, the first of the pirates entered the room. They were humanoid, though they had rubbery grey skin. They wore a worn set of overalls with various patches sewn on, and held a small light. Whilst I had assumed they were pirates, I wasn't sure. Until the next pair wandered in.

One stood tall, its insectoid face darting around. Its body was thick, supported by ten spindly legs. It held a remote in one hand, that it casually pressed. It caused its companion to spasm in pain, as a collar lit up. I could make out they were human, and clearly malnourished.

"Oi Graxxa, what do you make of this place?"

The rubbery one spoke, glancing at the insect. The insect chittered, moving its head to the side.

"Clear good place, cold hive makes base easier. Slave, what of this place?"

It pressed the remote again, elicting another spasm. The human shook as the shock wore off.

"P-please, don't. I swore to help."

"That not answer."

It pressed the button again. I used to think of myself as a weak man in conflict. I hated fighting, as I was never good at it. But I felt a new rage within me, directed at these pirates. Not only had they invaded my home, but they kept slaves, and tortured them. I couldn't let that go.

I reached down in the dark, holding onto the ceiling with my feet. I put my hands either side of the insects head, before grabbing and lifting them into the air. I knew I was strong now, but they felt practically weightless to me. I clamped a hand over its mouth, wrapping my other arm around its body and squeezing. I only meant to hold it tightly, instead I felt a crack, as its shell broke and insides pulped.

Below me the rubbery one spun around, looking for its friend. Seeing only the human there, it shouted, advancing on them.

"Graxxa! Where are you?! Where is he slave?!"

I threw the twitching body, letting it thud into the ground. The pair below me jumped, light spinning to land on the body.

"Graxxa?"

I gave a chuckle, which came out as a chitter of my own. The rubbery one began to spin, looking in all directions.

"Who's there?! Show yourself!"

I felt a terrible need to oblige, a feeling of anger, a need to cause pain. I crouched againt the ceiling, poised to leap. I scraped it with my tail, letting him locate me. His light fell on me, and he began to yell again.

"What the-?!"

He didn't get to finish, as I leapt onto him. I felt things break, as he crumpled below my massive form. He gurgled beneath me, desperately clinging onto life. I pitied him, seeing blue blood leak. With an almost caring hand I patted his cheek, before striking his forehead with the end of my tail. He finally died, and I stood to my full height, turning to the human.

He cowered before me. I felt it right for a moment, seeing him afraid. But then I remembered who I was. I wasn't a monster. I was a scientist. Through changed vocal cords I struggled to speak. They were rough, but to me just about understandable.

"Friend. Help."
