"Well, that didn't work."

I looked around at the artifact strewn room. Each one of them was priceless. Countries went to war over them, people had killed their loved ones over them. But right now they were scattered around the place.

I heard a thud from behind me. I turned, watching the skeletal form behind stepping back from Eternities End. The oversized sword in the shape of a clock hand was stuck into the ground, the sand inside its glass blade running down. It had been my last hope at ending my life. It was meant to accelerate aging to the point of the target being turned to nothingness.

But like all the others it failed. I was still alive. Death still couldn't take me. It wearily sat on a chair, sighing heavily. I walked next to it, taking the other seat.

"That was the last one wasn't it?"

Death gave a nod. It produced a large roll of parchment, looking at the final entry. With a slow motion, it crossed off the last name.

"I'm sorry."

I rested my hand on its shoulder. My mouth pulled into a small smile, as I gently pushed it back and forth.

"You did all you could. I am truly thankful you tried to help grant me my rest."

It patted my hand, the only living thing it could touch.

"What, what are you going to do now?"

I sighed.

"I... I don't know. If the combined knowledge of mortals, Death and gods can't end my existence, I don't know what can."

Death gave another sigh.

"I wish I could take you into my embrace. If any are deserving of rest, it is you."

I glanced around at the room again, thinking.

"Well, if I must remain, I may as well do some good. These artifacts, they should be sealed shouldn't they?"

Death gave a nod.

"Indeed. None deserve the suffering these things bring."

I stood again, looking around.

"Well then, let's bind this place to me. As long as I endure, these will not be released. And when new ones are crafted, we can try them as well. And if not, they too can be sealed."

Death looked around as well, nodding again.

"That, that is a good plan. In the meantime, I shall continue think on this as well. There must be some way to bring about your end."

I gave a mirthless laugh.

"One can hope."
