"Your rage is quite something."

The voice was hoarse, spoken from a throat that had shouted orders on a field of battle and chaos. I turned to look at its source. To my right stood a towering figure wearing scratched and dented armour. It's left arm carried a battered shield, the right a sword dripping with fresh blood. It's head was a skull, eye sockets filled with red flames. A crown of black finished its look, one that hurt to look at directly.

"Your heart holds no care for those you destroyed. To most, that makes you a monster."

I gave a short, pitiless laugh as I looked back at the village. I could just about hear the anguished screams of a few people, as they were trapped in their burning homes.

"They made my life hell. This is what they deserve."

"Quite."

I frowned, looking back at the figure. It's sword floated from its hand, hovering behind its head. Its blazing eyes stayed locked on me, as it stood over me.

"Who are you, and why do you care?"

The figure snorted, it's now free hand hanging down.

"I am the God of War. I am looking for my successor."

I looked it up and down, before shrugging. I had long since forgotten or cared for the whims of the Gods. None had answered my prayers, leaving me to a childhood of suffering.

"Ok."

The God snorted again, reaching out with its massive hand. It placed it on my shoulder, though it was easily as big as my torso.

"You look to be a worthy one, one who can wage war from both sides."

I looked at the visage of violence, raising an eyebrow.

"You think I should take your place?"

It gave a barking laugh, one that shook the ground. At each bark the nearby flames leapt higher, fed by its mere presence.

"In time yes. But first you must be prepared. Only those who are ready can take up the Celestial Crowns."

I glanced back at the inferno of my past, before returning to the God that stood before me.

"Fine, let's do this."

As I agreed, I felt a strange sensation on my head. It was as though something pushed through from my skull, splitting skin with no pain. I reached up to feel a spiked crown on my head, sharp and brutal.

"Let us go then, Heir of War."
