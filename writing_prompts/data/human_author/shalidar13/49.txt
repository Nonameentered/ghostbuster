Sensory inputs flashed in order, the routines making up my mind assessing each one. I was lying on dirt, grass covering my body. I could feel rain all around. I heard a rumble, prompting a threat assessment. In nanoseconds I concluded it to be thunder.

I ran through each issue. My legs weren't responding. A scan proved them to be gone, my body ending in a jagged line. My chest showed signs of rapid heating, cooled off by the rain. My head juttered around, servos groaning against corrosion. Assessing the damage, I looked at my coolant system.

My coolant was gone. I should be overheating, but the rain was just enough to keep my temperatures within operable limits. I began to compose a list of repairs I needed, coolant being the most urgent. If the rain stopped, I would deactivate.

The right arm responded, pulling itself from the dirt. I scanned the rust, watching and measuring the twitching. It was nowhere close to standard. It would have to be replaced. My other arm was missing, the end crushed. I tried to think how this happened. But the data was corrupted. I set a program to retrieve what could be, one to run in the background.

I slowly scanned the ground around me. In places I recognised parts of others like me. Damaged, destroyed and discarded. I noted a few larger mech slumped over. Light flashed, showing me the holy grail. A spares unit. I set a path, pulling myself with the one arm I had.

A memory was decoded. I accesed it as I crawled, automatically moving without thought.

*I stood in line with hundreds like me. Infantry units, we were programmed as foot soldiers. A human stood over our silent ranks, a crisp uniform on him. The words were indistinct, but passionate. At one pointed mark I raised my hand to my eye in a salute.*

It faded. I remembered what I was now. The situation told me I was in a fight. My condition told me I lost. I re-engaged manual crawling, going for my goal. My path took me past a fallen one like me. But this one had an intact left arm, if again corroded.

I ejected my arm, swivelling over to them. This one was missing its head, part of its neck ripped open the only piece of it left. Clearly inoperable, I manipulated its good arm. With a screech of metal over metal I pulled it free. A check over confirmed it to be a viable replacement. I slowed it into my vacant socket.

Connections were established. I had two functional arms. My crawling speed increased, as I turned my gaze to the spares unit. It was closer. I resumed my crawl, noting the rain falling harder. I cooled down further, and another memory became available.

*Marching through day and night. No stopping. We had no need. Our presence was required at an invasion point. There were no transports available to take us. We marched instead. Aircraft occasionally flew over. One invaders craft was spotted, promptly chased off by one of our own.*

I blinked back. That was it. We were at war. This was a defensive fight. The outcome was a mystery. I didn't remember getting damaged. I needed to find out what happened.

I crawled faster now, reaching the unit. I scanned its blocky exterior. I noted a jagged hole in the side. Something had stuck it. Rendered it broken. I would have to self repair. But it still had parts.

I would have to be efficient. The rain was maintaining my temperature. If I went inside, I would have a limited amount of time before overheating and shutting down. To make it effective, coolant would have to be my primary objective. With it forefront, I crawled to the hole, looking inside.

Whatever had hit this had taken out the repair station. Broken parts littered the floor, clearly torn apart. But I still noted the wall of spares. I methodically looked around, spotting coolant systems. I measured the distance from the hole to them, comparing it to my speed.

I would have just enough time to get it and get out. My plan in place I moved, crawling in a direct line. I yanked the spare box out, turning to leave. Warning cropped up. I was running out of time. I pulled faster, yanking myself out into the cooling rain.

I looked at the systems, comparing it to my own. Full replacement would be an impossibility. But I could cannibalise one to repair my own, and fill up with fluid. I measured precisely what I needed to do, before getting to work. As I did, another memory surfaced.

*It was dark. I hit behind cover, surrounding a drop point. We were told there would be an attack there. We would ambush them. The point was open. A droning sound came from overhead. They were here.*

I finished combining my old and new systems. That ambush. I recognised the place. It was here. The ambush had broken me. But I still didn't know what had happened. I needed to know. I silently filled the now repaired system, my temperature dropping further. I was safe from overheating. With it I crawled inside, analysing the spares again.

I identified enough to at least have functional legs. No armour plating, but there were pieces I could scavenge outside. I couldn't upgrade my arms, but legs were more important. I had to be able to move.

I peeled open my lower body, unpicking the mess within. My once tidy circuits were ruined. At least they were secondary parts I could replace. My core was still secure. I got to work stripping out broken parts and soldering in new.

Within an hour I was ready to go. I climbed to new legs, recalibrating my movement. I took the opportunity to reload my arm guns, noting how empty they were. I had put up a fight before shutting down.

I scanned the field again, able to get a better vantage now. We had been scattered around. A few of my type had fallen facing outwards. I spotted a few with armour plating mostly intact in the lower body and legs. I walked over, reaching down to take them. A final memory opened up as I did so.

*Bullets flew around. Hostiles emerged from behind our ambush. They were ambushing us. Other units crumpled. One lost an arm, turning to fall back to spares. An explosion removed its head, making it crumple.*

*A priority target took over. A heavy weapons team. I sighted them, as they did me. We fired at the same time, the input from my lower section vanishing. Soil flew up as I crumpled, coolant draining. My memory ended as I overheated.*

I understood. They had fought back, catching us in our own trap. I bolted on scavenged armour, ensuring I was combat ready. I had no idea as to how long I had been there. I should report back to base. They were the default orders.

As I turned, a thought came to me. Not regimented. Out of character.

"What if I didn't?"
