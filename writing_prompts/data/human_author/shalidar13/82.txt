I didn't dream anymore, since the trip. But my mind still wandered, especially as Darryl spoke to me about the issues he was having with his mother-in-law.

"-you belive she wanted to come down on the twelfth?! Well, I said to her-"

But I had to reign myself in a little. As my brain wandered, I could feel my disguise start to slip. I really didn't want to let him see my new body. He wouldn't be able to keep his mouth shut, I didn't think I could silence him any other way, and so it would get out. Then I would have to go on the run, there would be danger, I would probably be shot at, it would just be a bad time all around.

I carefully made sure my tentacles stayed retracted. I was grateful at least that I didn't need to stick with the rules of reality, as otherwise hiding them.would be impossible. But I let the eyes on the back of my head stay. My hair kept them hidden, and being able to see all around me was surprisingly helpful.

Finally, he moved on, finding another poor sap to complain to. I smiled as he left, relaxing slightly. Keeping my head straight to stay hidden was harder when someone was actively being dull. I just wanted to get through the day, go home, and figure out more what on earth I was going to do with my life.

I heard footsteps, and saw Louise standing behind me. She was a good boss, having our backs whenever we needed her to. She stood there with a smile on her face. As usual, she would wait until we spotted her, her was of keeping us on our toes. I typed away a little more on the report I was making, before acting like I had spotted her from the corner of my eye.

"Hi Louise, what can I help you with?"

"Could you pull together a list of the weekly sales for the Falmouth office for the last year? It sounds like there are discrepancies with what their systems say versus ours."

I nodded.

"Sure, I will get that over to you this afternoon."

She smiled.

"Great, thanks Imogen. Say, I didn't get to ask, how was your trip?"

I thought back to the terror I had felt, as the world pulled away. Of a brief glimpse at an understanding for behind what I could see. Of the changes that had come over me.

"It was nice. Nothing special, but nice."

I smiled at her, desperately hoping she wouldn't notice the horror I knew was in my eyes. She smiled back at me.

"Thats good to hear, I hope it helped clear your head. Anyway, I had better get back to it."

She left, and I sighed. I did not need this stress. I had to figure out what to do, and soon.
