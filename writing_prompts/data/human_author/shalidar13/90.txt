"I'm not hiding from you."

I raised any eyebrow.

"Then what, pray tell, are you hiding from?"

The dumpster shook, the lid raising slightly. I could just about make out the blokes head, before it ducked down again.

"I'm hiding from the thing behind you."

I turned my head. There was nothing behind me but an empty alleyway. I shook my head. This person was acting like they were on some form of drugs. But if I could just get through to them, I could make a new friend. I liked having friends.

"There's nothing there. Now get out of there, you are better than that."

Once again the lid popped up.

"You don't see it? You don't feel it's presence?"

I frowned.

"I have no idea what you are talking about."

The dumpster stayed closed now, and I heard a sigh.

"You're going to think I'm crazy."

I had to laugh at that.

"Really? Because hiding in bins is such a sane thing to do."

The bloke gave a short laugh of his own.

"I guess not. But anyway. I can see things that aren't there, they hide in a reflection of our world. You have one attached to you."

The dumpster shook, and the bloke screamed.

"IT'S HERE!!"

The lid was thrust open, and he climbed out. His hair was cut short, with a nose that had clearly been broken at some point. His clothes had a print of some band, one I couldn't make out. 

He tried to run, but the air seemed to simmer behind him. An unseen force threw him to the side, crashing into the wall. He was stunned from the blow, as his eyes rolled up in the back of his head. I casually stepped up to his side, gently shaking him.

"Hey, wake up."

He groaned, as I heard an almost phantom popping sound. His eyes slowly returned to me, struggling to focus.

"It's ok. You just had a little fall. Can you remember your name?"

He looked around blankly, before blinking.

"Yes, sorry. Its Terrence Daliger."

I smiled.

"I'm glad you remember Terry."

He spoke slowly at me, his eyes confused.

"Who, who are you again?"

I let my smile due.

"I'm Lily, your friend."

With that he nodded, false memories slotting into place.

"Yes of course."

I whispered as I help him to his feet.

"Thanks Devil."

I always liked making new friends.
