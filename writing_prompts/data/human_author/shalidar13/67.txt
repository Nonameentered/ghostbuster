"Hey Ma!"

She smiled at me as always as I stepped into the kitchen. It was full of the delicious smells I knew well, having been a loyal patron of her diner for years. But this time I was a guest no longer. Since finding out the secret to her recipes, I had been hired by her.

"Good morning young Frederick. Still happy to help out this old lady I see."

If you didn't know it, you would think her just any other elderly lady. She always had a kind word, or a shoulder to cry on. Her food was to die for, just a smell would bring you back.

"Of course Ma. How can I help today?"

I didn't know her name. It was one of her many secrets, but I didn't mind. She was happy me calling her Ma, saying it made her feel like I was part of her family. She pulled a pie from the oven, perfectly brown as always.

"Oh well, I can handle just fine you know that. But I do believe this pie isn't destined for the folks."

I had grown used to this now. She had a knack for knowing exactly when and where her food was needed. It would stay perfect during the journey, as fresh as the moment it was taken from the oven. The strangest part to me was how no-one else besides me had noticed it.

I knew why of course. She had an aura, and once you left it would would forget all the little details. Everyone knew of the diner, thinking it had always been there. They couldn't out a date, but agreed it had been run by similar people for generations. I had just happened to stumble in as her aura dropped, and I had understood the truth.

"Who is it for?"

She gave a sweet smile, placing it in a plain white box.

"Oh, just some woman who just became a leader."

With a flick of her wrist a label appeared on its surface. It was made of scribbles, but I knew it would reach the right person.

They always did.
