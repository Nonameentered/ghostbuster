"You are special, more than you know."

I rolled my eyes at Dad's tone. He always hinted that things were not what they seem. He spoke so often of hidden pasts, keeping parts secret from me. He promised it would make sense once I was old enough. But he never told me when that would be. No matter how often I needled him about it, he wouldn't say.

"Come on dad. You act like I'm meant to be important."

He smiled at me.

"You are. In fact, I think its time you knew."

I narrowed my eyes at him, crossing my arms.

"Are you really going to tell me? Or is this another poor attempt at a joke?"

His vaguely amused expression changed, becoming deadly serious.

"No. I'm not joking anymore."

With a sigh he reached up, feeling in the crevice atop his hunting cupboard. From it he withdrew a small chest, old but extravagantly carved. A golden lock sealed it, one that matched a key he took from around his neck.

"The truth is, I am no mere huntsman. Even this village is no ordinary village. Every man, woman and child has sworn their allegiance to our family."

He unlocked the chest, lifting back the lid. Inside was a green silk cushion, in which sat a crown of pure black.

"I am the Black King. The one whose knights serve beyond even death itself. The other Kings are Kings in name only. I am the only one to hold royal power. As my daughter, you too hold it, as the Black Princess."

With a sigh, Dad reached back up, taking out a second chest. This was smaller, but equally ornate. He unlocked it with the same key as before, turning it to me. I slowly leaned forwards, opening it. On another green silk cushion sat a black tiara, clearly unworn.

"Dad... why keep this hidden?"

He bowed his head.

"The other Kings fear me. Alone I was a target, a long lived one that's true, but only a target. But I was a known element in the constant game of royal battles. They tolerated me, and my slow expansion. But you, you changed it. If they knew of your existence, you would be their first priority. An Heiress to the Black Throne, they wouldn't allow you to live."

He slowly clicked each finger, bending it with his other hand.

"So I hid you, until such time as you were ready. I let them think I had vanished, my kingdom empty. But my loyal vassals came with me here, to protect us both, and let you have a childhood you would otherwise be without. Now you are grown. Now you are ready to learn the power that lies within us. And now we can reclaim our land."
