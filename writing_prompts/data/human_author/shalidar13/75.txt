I got into work on time, as I always did. I received the usual waves and greetings, as my coworkers saw me. I was aware of my privileged position on the workforce, being the company healer. Everyone made sure they were on good terms with me, in case they needed my help. I was incredibly well paid, as the bosses knew I could easily find other work.

To my surprise, as I walked towards my little office on the factory floor, I saw Damien standing there. Being the boss, he spent most of his time up away from the line. He only ever came down when necessary, or when he needed a stern word with someone.

"Cass, good to see you. Can we have a chat?"

His voice was level, but it obviously wasn't a question. I nodded, taking off my bag.

"Certainly."

I unlocked my office, leading him in. It wasn't a huge space, but had everything I needed. A desk on one side, with a bed next to it. There were cupboards filled with various supplies I might need, along with a couple of chairs. Damien took one, aside seated myself in my office chair.

"How can I help?"

He pushed the door closed, before crossing his arms.

"It has come to my attention that you use your lunch break to visit the hospital."

I shrugged.

"I do. What's the issue?"

He gave a long sigh.

"We pay you to keep an eye on our guys, not go and waste your energy for free when we might need it."

I saw where this was going. I doubted it was the fact I was going to the hospital in my spare time that was the issue. It was the fact I didn't charge. He was a capitalist through and through.

"I'm going to stop you there. Yes, I do heal those who otherwise have to rely on mundane medicines. However, I don't just go there out if the goodness of my heart."

It was a little white lie. Truth be told, I would do so anyway. The fact I got something out if it was a bonus.

"When I go there, I also chat with any nurses or doctors who have time to spare. They keep me updated on the latest treatments in progress, and any other developments. In return, I have been healing patients as you say, but also implying that you know what I am doing, and give your blessings."

Damien frowned.

"Why? Why do you make them think that?"

I smiled.

"It's mainly in case of a catastrophic emergency. I'm good. You know that, and I know that. But if anything when catastrophically wrong, I wouldn't be able to heal everyone. I can't be everywhere. However, as they think you are in essence donating to them, the hospital will be more likely to have spaces for anyone I can't."

His eyes widened, as he realised what I was saying.

"Oh.... oh I see. Well then, um, never mind. Have a good day."

I smiled, watching him stand up.

"You too."
