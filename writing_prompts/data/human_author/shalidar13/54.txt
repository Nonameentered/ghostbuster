The first thing I woke to was pain. My right arm was ablaze with it, coupled with a feeling of wrongness. I groaned, shifting slightly. With a regimented mind I pushed it to the side, allowing me to register my other senses.

I was warm, with something soft over my chest and legs. I could smell some form of meat cooking. I could hear it bubble, along with a quiet hum. I could taste old blood in my mouth, probably from a fight. With effort I forced my eyes open, taking in my surroundings.

I was in a furnished room. The walls were mostly bare, save for a couple of paintings of fruit. Against one wall was a chest of drawers, on top of which sat a vase of roses. A simple door lay open, the source of the hum and smell. My gear was carefully placed beside it, the leather armour cleaned.

"Ah, you're awake!"

A cheerful voice rang out, followed by footsteps. I looked up to the door, as they approached. I wasn't sure who I expected to see. Maybe an ex-hunter, or a wannabe.

The first thing I noticed was their skin. It was bright pink, and oddly shiny. A pair of horns curled from either side of their head, with a larger one rising from the back. Purple hair covered their bases, flowing down beyond their shoulders. Their eyes were red, crinkled with good humour. Their body was lithe, with the build of a runner. A tail held up a bowl of something, finishing off their appearance.

"You gave us quite a fright hun, fighting old Ragebone."

I went to push myself up, seeing the demon before me. But as I did, I noticed the absence to my right. I looked down, finally remembering. A tearing sensation, followed by agony. My arm dangling in the grip of a War demon.

"My arm..."

The demon gave a sigh, pulling at my cover.

"I'm sorry hun. I did what I could, but reattaching limbs is beyond what I can do."

I struggled to calm down. This was an end to my purpose. I couldn't fight like this. And now I had a demon who basically had me at their mercy. I felt myself shaking, and a hand rested gently on my shoulder.

"It's going to be OK hun."

I forced myself to speak again, seeing the demon look at me with pity.

"Why... why are you helping me?"

They gave me a pat, before pulling me up the bed. They fluffed up pillows behind me, making sure I had support.

"You needed it hun. And Ragebone felt just terrible after you fainted. He brought you to me to heal you."

I frowned, as they put a tray on my lap. The bowl was placed on it, revealed to contain a form of chicken soup. They put a spoon next to it.

"Now, I know you're a hunter hun. But that's no reason for us to just let you die. Besides, we're different from your usual demon hun."

I sighed internally, picking up the spoon. True, it might be poisoned. But I couldn't do anything else like this. Especially not with the demon watching.

"How are you different? All demons are monsters."

They laughed.

"Oh, normally I would agree with you. But in this place, we push aside such base tendencies. Of course, we still have the beasts below the surface, but unless provoked we keep them chained."

They nudged towards the soup, before standing up.

"Now eat your soup hun, I will be back in a bit to collect your bowl."

They left the room, and I felt my tension ease slightly. I wasn't sure where to go from here. But if this demon was being kind, I would take it. Heaven knows I needed a break for once.
