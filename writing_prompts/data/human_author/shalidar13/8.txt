At first I thought I was getting ill. I was shaking, feeling incredibly hot and sweating. I made the decision to stay in bed, hoping whatever this was would pass. I didn't notice when I fell asleep, but I sure noticed the dream.

I stood atop a stage, made from pure white stone. Below me stood a sea of faces, all staring. They spoke as one, many voices overlapping to make one of unquestionable strength.

"At the tipping point of the world, one shall decide its fate. They who hold the power of all, but the experience of none. So we pass on the burden of power to thee."

Their eyes rolled back as streams of light erupted from them. These formed ribbons that leapt high into the air, every colour imaginable showing. Then they descended, rushing into my body and filling me. It was a mix of pain, joy and awe I felt, as raw strength forced its way into every aspect of my being.

I woke up with a gasp, the dream still vivid, my body still feeling the after effects. I felt my senses shift, as the given powers manifested themselves. I knew it was real, even if I had dreamt it. I carefully reached out a hand, wanting to test. Just a simple one, lifting my slipper from the floor.

It shifted, but I wasn't putting enough power in. I focused more, making it leap into the air. It was far faster than I expected, more strength behind it then I had anticipated. The shock clouded my mind, until I realised how steady my hand was. I didn't feel ill anymore. But I had a new problem instead.

That simple test proved I had no idea how to use this. If I tried to act with them now, I would make things undoubtedly worse. I had to get better with these powers.

I threw off my duvet, leaping out of bed. Moving as fast as I dared I packed up my most valuable possessions, along with things for an extended retreat. Trying to hide this and act as normal wouldn't go well. I had to become a recluse first.

Once I gathered enough, I took off, using the granted power of flight. I was glad it was night, letting me practice without the world's eyes on me. It took time to work out how to stay steady, but that turned out to be relatively simple. Just slight motions every now and then made the perfect adjustments.

As I flew, choosing to vanish into the heart of Antarctica, I concentrated on what I could do. I could feel the strength of beings from myth and legend in me. The powers of every pantheon at the tips of my fingers. I could feed myself, survive the harsh climate, and most importantly, survive isolation.

Even during the flight, I began to experiment. I pulled on the weather, calling up a storm for Zeus. In my haste to practice I put in too much, making a terrible mess. Thankfully I had waited until I was on open ocean. It probably wouldnt affect anyone. But it was sobering. With little effort I had made a near disaster. I had to be careful. If I wasn't, I would kill an awful lot of people.

Their wordscame to me again. The world was on a knifes edge. And I had the curse of deciding its fate.
