"It hurts, doesn't it?"

I looked up, tears streaming from my face. I could still feel the void He had left me, where he had torn out the power I had grown for him. The faith I had carefully cultivated.

But instead of my modest home, I saw a small shaft of light around me. Beyond it was nothing but black, devoid of any features. I spun to look in all directions, seeing nothing. Instinctively I reached for His symbol around my neck. But all I found was the broken scraps He had left.

"My father is a real piece of work isn't he?"

Something came through the darkness. Whatever it was was enormous, slightly lighter than the utter void I was in. But I could not make anything out. I clenched the scraps tight, before finding my voice. It cracked, the pain feeding through.

"He left me."

"I know."

The thing suddenly became visible. A face of white, mouth pulled down slightly. Eyes made of swirling purples and blues, spiralling into a central point. The face of His sworn enemy.

"I felt it child, and have seen this before. He gives and grows such faith as you had. Then takes it once it has grown enough, to increase his own power. Time and time again this has happened. I'm sorry."

The face was suddenly attached to a head, with vine-like hair bordering its edges.

"But you need not be alone. I can give back what he took from you."

Her words were sweet, with a sinister edge. But my heart leapt at the thought of having its hole filled.

"But... why?"

She smiled, one filled with compassion.

"To grant you a life you deserve. You served faithfully, does that not mean you should be rewarded? Does it not mean you should get to enjoy your life? And is it not right that my father gets some comeuppance?"

Lovely words that tickled my mind. I wanted to accept. But part if me remained loyal still, despite what had happened.

"I... I can't just turn my back."

She scoffed, as a body appeared beneath her head. She wore a dress made of pieces of worn armour, some still caked with blood.

"He already did it to you. He doesn't deserve your love."

The last resistance fell, as I embraced the idea of feeling whole again.

"Ok. Please, help me."

She smiled, before becoming human sized before me. The light surrounding me began to fade, as she drew me into a strong hug.

"You're mine now."
