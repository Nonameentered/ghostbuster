"Ah, welcome! What can I do for you today?"

A thin, tall woman towered over me, wearing a tattered and worn ball gown. She flashed a grin, hands on her hips. I looked around at the seemingly random objects, beginning to wonder if this was a mistake.

"Hi.... I'm looking to get some gifts for some not so good people."

Her grin widened, as she gestured to the cluttered shop floor.

"I have many gifts that you could take. The question is, what result do you want? Annoyance? Pain? Death? Eternal torment?"

She made no move to hide what this was. A shop full of cursed items. I gave a small smirk.

"I don't want them dead. I want them to get annoyed definitely, maybe losing some nights sleep as well. But I don't want them dead. Not if it would be easily traced back to me."

She nodded in understanding.

"Of course. I understand. So, who are the unlucky people? How can I help?"

I reached into my pocket, taking out the list of people I had to buy for.

"Lets see... Kaleigh. She is a brat, whose parents are serious enablers. If she doesn't get what she wants, she will throw a fit and break things."

The woman nodded, rummaging through a shelf. She gave a snort of amusement as she retrieved a barbie doll,wiping off some dust.

"This would be perfect. A jealous little doll, that if not played with will wreck the other toys. Plus, the longer she goes without being played with, the more she will act creepy towards the owner. But she won't harm them, just creep them out."

I grinned.

"Perfect. Then there is Simon. The racist uncle. I could really do with him being knocked down a few pegs."

She thought for a moment, before going to a box. She rummaged through it, pulling out a fancy looking bottle of brandy.

"Here. This has a taste that is to die for. But once you have it, you won't want another drink of it until the next day. The dreams will be vivid, and based on your interactions during the day. So if Simon is cruel to others, the dreams will be cruel to him. Plus it will make sure he doesn't make the connection."

I was very pleased with that. Nodding in agreement, I looked down my list again.

"Oh, there's the twins, Peter and Paula. They are incredibly entitled, and will yell at anyone who doesn't bow to them and obey their every whim."

The woman grinned at that, picking out a watch and necklace from a jewellery box.

"Here, these are very fashionable items. But, unfortunately when wearing them, misfortune will come. They will spill their own drinks, their food will slide off forks, and any random act of nature will most certainly land on them. I had someone wear one to the seaside once. They went in a black shirt, but came back white."

I laughed at that image. I tucked the rest of my list away, nodding to the items.

"I will take the lot. I will be back soon with a more comprehensive list I'm sure."

She grinned back at me, devilish amusement behind her eyes.

"Excellent. I always value rare returning customers."
