They never stood a chance.

I was old, far older than they could imagine. The result of a cursed ritual, one I ensured could not be repeated. I was tied to the world, for as long as it remained, so would I. In age I found ways to tap into greater amounts of the World Reservoir, the ocean of power that surrounded us all.

I had grown weary of the gods, and their attempts to kill me. I was a monster in their eyes, something they could not permit to live. But they could not interfere directly. In their place they sent those who were easily swayed to fight for them.

Some had reasons, ones I could understand. After removing a village that worshipped a sealed horror, I was hunted for killing their family by one who didn't know the truth. I took an ancient artifact that would bring ruin to the world. Its holders weren't going to hand it over, and in the grand scheme of things their lives meant nothing. Of course that painted a target on my back.

I had beaten back many groups. Some gave me a challenge, but most in recent years were barely worth the effort. It was bad enough to kill those who stood for good, as I could understand their actions. But having to fight what were basically kids hurt the most, as they should have been enjoying life, not in a fight to the death.

The latest group were the youngest yet. They had been given blessings by the gods, strength they were nowhere near ready to wield. And yet they did, charging in battle towards me. They were brave, and had all the hallmarks of becoming great forces for good. And I was finally fed up of having to cut such peoples lives short. When I beat them, I did not kill them. I merely drained them until they were too weak to fight back.

"This is not your war to wage."

I hid my rage from them, talking in a calm voice. Those young faces looked at me with hate, as the gods decreed.

"You have slaughtered countless. It is our responsibility to end you."

I sighed, crouching next to their chosen leader.

"I do not deny I have killed. But so have you, in your quest to defend. Understand, I do not think you are like me. I am different, but I can do much to prevent you from making the same mistake I did."

He glared at me.

"What lies do you speak?"

I sighed again, patting his back. As I did I took the barest portion of power, letting it heal his body whilst leaving him weak.

"I trusted the gods once, like you. I thought they would protect us all. But they squabble and bicker, like children. They send innocents like yourselves to fight for them, and for what? Mere disagreements between them."

I fought to keep the disgust out of my voice.

"No, they do not deserve such respect and obedience. I do what I do to protect my home, nothing more. They are the ones to declare me evil, and hunt me down. I do not hate you, for you know no better. But they do."

I moved to the next member, preparing to heal them.

"You are kids, recruited with no thought for your safety. I have had enough of dealing with such callous individuals, who send you to me like lambs to slaughter. I do not ask you to change, but I will make the change for you. Those gods who so cruelly threw you to the wolves will find the fangs turned on them instead."
