I felt the circle snap open, releasing me onto the mortal world. For a moment I was filled with the desire for bloodshed and carnage, as I walked amongst those fresh souls. But that moment soon passed, as it always did.

"White wine's in the fridge, red's on the side. Choose your tipple, then come have a seat!"

I grinned at my summoner and friend. Agatha was a sweet girl, one who craved knowledge. She didn't want it for any purpose, but instead just wanted it for the sake of having knowledge. I had known her for years, after her first summoning me.

She had wanted forbidden knowledge at one point. I was of course eager to share, in exchange for her soul. Instead of accepting though, she decided to question me about what I used souls for. She was amazed to hear how we used them as food and fuel, to keep both ourselves and our creations running.

She kept on summoning me after that. Sometimes to chat, other times to just hang out. I grew fond of her company, battling down my old instincts when she first released me. I didn't want to destroy her. Her mind was a beautiful thing, always eager, and always listening. She was so much different to what I had experienced below, it was incredible.

I pressed my form down into a suitable female form. Though my demonic heritage poked through, my skin purple and a pair of leathery wings on my back. Still, resizing meant going through her small apartment was much easier. I found my way to the kitchen, pouring myself a glass of red this time.

"So, tell me, how's your studying going?"

Agatha grinned at my question, pouring herself a glass of white.

"Well thanks! Get this, I found a book on homunculi."

I tapped my glass into hers, taking a sip.

"Oh how fascinating, we don't have much on that below. Tell me all about it.".

She tapped my chest, grinning.

"Only if you do my hair again."

I gave a mock groan, before laughing. One time, one time I had offered to do her hair in a style I had seen below. Now it seemed that it was all she wanted from me.

"Sure, OK then. But you had better not hide any of the juicy bits!"
