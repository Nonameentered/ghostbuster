"Why, why do you not fight me? Am I not worthy of your attention?"

Julbras shook his head, leaving his sword sheathed.

"You are worthy. Any I choose to face in combat are always worthy. But I have no desire to fight you this day."

Polux was confused. He had taken this town with a squad of Primal Golems. Even now they towered over it, a quiet threat to any who stood against him. The populace was his to do with however he chose.

"But why? Are you not the kingdom's greatest warrior?"

Julbras smirked.

"I am yes. However, let us be honest here. If we were to fight, I would win. You know it, and I know it. But I do not seek out fights for the sake of it. I fight where necessary.

You probably didn't realise I could scry on your village. I did so on the way over. I saw how you treat those you rule over. I saw how you made sure they produced enough to keep them fed and healthy, along with plenty more for yourself. I saw how you repaired a broken house. You might claim that you do it for selfish reasons, but you do good here."

He gave a snort.

"In fact, do you know which noble you took this from?"

Polux nodded.

"Baroness Gilra."

"Indeed. She has been a thorn in the side of our kingdom for years. She harms us, but does it in such a way we can't depose her. But you took land from her, which is in fact a blessing."

Polux frowned, crossing his arms.

"How was this a blessing?"

Julbras tapped the coat of arms on his chest.

"As a noble, she was sworn to protect the crown, by protecting her lands. You took it, and she couldn't field a force to take it back. So she came crying to the throne, begging for me to help. It proves she is weak, and incapable of ruling. So you set off a process for us to remove her."

He reached into a bag, taking out a royal writ.

"The real reason I'm here is to make an agreement with you. You can keep this village, so long as you do not bring harm to the people. In return, I will not remove you, and you will act much like a small Land Lord, and pay appropriate taxes."

He gave Polux a steady look.

"What do you say?"
