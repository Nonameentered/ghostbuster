Sitting in the tavern room, I closed my eyes, cradling a habd sized orb. Its surface was green, save for a black slit running down one side. It glowed as I reached into the All-Seeing Orb's power, casting my mind out across the city.

It came to me as a bird's-eye view of the place, centred on the inn. As my view settled, spots began to emerge. I ignored the blue, as the many magical items shone through. First came a large number of purple spots. As always, the most numerous were stolen items. The brighter the spot, the more powerful the object. Most were small, with few larger.

I ignored them for the moment. As the majority were common items, I didn't concern myself. Self cleaning plates, self repairing clothes, even ever-burning candles, all were relatively common to be stolen. The larger ones I would deal with towards the end, as they were easy to sort out.

Next came red. These were very few and far between. Each was powerful, as a curse had to be. I didn't need to remember the number, as the All Seeing Orb burnt the image into my mind. They would be high priority, as curses were never any joke.

Finally, there was one spot that overpowered them all. A black presence, within the district populated with the upper class. A rare item for me, as it was forbidden by the people who made this Orb. An object that would be beyond my power to break, they would inevitably cause permanent harm to the world around them. I didn't know what, but I didn't particularly care.

Knowing this was my first target, I focused on it. My vision blurred closer, before stopping in a well lit room. A staff stood in a glass case, red mist flowing from its head. I could see the streams of power around it from its enchantments. Once again the Orb burnt its image into my mind. I would be able to perfectly recall its every detail, a fact I would happily use.

I let my sight move around it, ensuring I had seen it in its entirety. As it did, I heard its quiet voice.

*You know you want me.*

I flinched, pulling away. My connection with the Orb broke, and I was back in my room. My breath came heavily, as I calmed my racing heart. I hated when they did that. Intelligent items like that would always cause problems.

Shaken, I thought of what it looked like. It seemed to have been made from a twisted black branch, with curled sticks forming a cage at the top from which the mist leaked. I would have to get a basic wooden staff to start off with, and modify it.

\-----

I had found a staff easily enough. It took a few days to reshape and colour it, and another few to give it the right level of enchantments to fool a casual look. Enough to hopefully fool them long enough for me to safely get it gone.

With it stashed in an Extended Pocket, I snuck through this city's rich district. Unlike the rest of the city, this area had paved roads over cobbled, with clean-clothed guards making regular patrols. I made sure to avoid them, heading towards my target.

As soon as I set eyes on the place, I knew it. Even after only seeing it from the sky, I knew it. A three storey building sat in the midst of lush gardens. Good land wasted on colourful flowers, trimmed hedges, and non-fruit bearing trees. The house itself was made of pale brown stones, with multiple windows of glass. Just looking from the outside I could tell its inhabitants were disgustingly rich.

It was the dead of night when I had arrived. I stuck to the shadows, carefully approaching this place. I listened carefully, hearing the low murmur of voices within. Of course they hired their own guards. They just wanted to make life difficult for me.

I thought back to my viewing. From the jump within, I could tell it was held in the upper portions of the house. I guessed top floor, towards the rear of the place. With that in mind, I dismissed any ground floor entrance. It would be were they would expect someone to break in from. I doubted they would think someone would be stupid enough to climb up and in.

I smiled to myself as thought that. Stupidity was something i was known for. Looking upwards, I spotted an open window. I snorted as I put on a pair of climbing gloves, eyeing the decorative stones. A couple of tugs let me know they were surprisingly secure, able to take my body weight. I started to climb, checking each hold carefully as I ascended. Some gave me concern, but soon enough I reached the window.

I looked inside, seeing a dark study. I cast an eye over a clear desk and chair, before inspecting the bookcases. They were filled with books and ornaments, nothing exciting. But it was quiet, a perfect place for me to slip in. I climbed in, listening as hard as possible. Up here was silence, a fact I was grateful for.

I took out the Orb, quickly looking. I hated using it in the open, as the glow was conspicuous. But in here I would probably be safe. I didn't choose to do an area view, instead from this area. Sure enough, the forbidden artifact was on this level. Even better, it was in the next room.

I was pleased at my luck. I opened the study door, seeing an empty hallway. A large door sat to my right, exactly where the staff would be. I slipped over to it, trying the handle. To my shock it was unlocked. With a shake of my head I slipped in.

There it was, the staff. Its whisper came again, now I was in the room.

*Yes... Take me.... Use me*

I winced at it. I hated ones that talked. I looked over the glass, seeing it being a complete solid piece. I didn't want to break it. I was a professional after all. I took a hold, carefully lifting the case up. The mist spilled out, chilling my feet as it rolled over them.

In a quick move, I grabbed it, careful to ensure only my gloves touched it. Even so, I felt an insidious pressure in my mind, as it pushed into my thoughts. I slipped it into another Extended Pocket, before taking out my fake. I slotted it onto place and replaced the case.

I smiled, slipping back out of the room, followed by the house. No-one had known I was there. Another forbidden artifact was reclaimed. I knew the Sealed Chamber would be pleased to get it, and work to removing it from existence.
