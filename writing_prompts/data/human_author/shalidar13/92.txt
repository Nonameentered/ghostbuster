I walked down hidden steps, descending into the earth. It was a tight, dark passage, roughly carved into rock. I walked close to doors that slowly swung open, with no other souls in sight. But I could feel their eyes watching me. They always watched me.

Further down I walked, passing door after door. Even when they opened, I was met with no sound but my own breathing.  It was an isolating feeling. Until I heard the distant moans and cries. They bled through one final door, much thicker than the others. But even this one opened before me.

Within were hundreds of circles of force. Before each was a plaque, bearing names. Names that haunted me, being so familiar. Within each circle was a person. They each had haunted expressions, with no sense of hope.

Something compelled me onwards. I passed by cage of force after cage of force. I found myself drawn past them all, to an empty circle. One that waited. The plaque before it was blank, before letters carved themselves into it.

*Rela Convec*

It was a name I knew all to well. A hidden force shoved me, and I flew within. The walls suddenly formed, trapping me in. Making me another prisoner, in our kingdom's great shame.

I awoke with a gasp, drenched in sweat. The dream had come again. Every month, without fail, I would have it. The burden of my gift. Or curse, depending on how you looked at it.

I thought back to it. Although the end was a dream, the place itself was not. It was a prison, for the worst of the worst. There was no record of its existence. It was guarded by carefully selected guardsmen with no familial connections. The cells would keep the prisoners alive, removing the need for provisions.

Those prisoners were the worst of the worst. Those who were sentenced to death. But that was a waste, for my bloodline. We could pass injuries from one to another. By having a prison full of candidates, it was easy to act as though we were simple healers.

I stretched, gathering my thoughts. I was near to a battlefield, where the kingdom had once again fought with the Galren City State Alliance. There would be a large number of injured people. They were counting on me to heal them.
