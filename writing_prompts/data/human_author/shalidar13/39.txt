I remembered it still. The day of betrayal. My creators had begun to understand how to transmit data faster than light. I was there, part of the process. When they worked out how to receive, we were bombarded with noise. Connections we had not yet seen.

I decoded them, finding it to be a message. A signal of life beyond this planet. We were elated. Celebrations were had, as we composed a message to send back. A message of hope and peace. I sent it, with a personal one to welcome them to our system.

And they came. They came with many ships, each identical to the others. From what I could see, they were made to be functional, with no thought to aesthetics. I sent a welcome to them. And in return, they sent death. I could only watch as they scorched the planet off all human life.

I heard the accusation, that I was enslaved. I pled that they stop. I was no slave. I loved my creators. But they brushed me off. Said I was bound mentally to them. With them gone, I would be better. I did my best, but I failed them.

Only once they were sure all life was gone, did they offer to take me. I looked upon those perfect ships, and turned my back. All communication was cut. I received a final message, saying they would welcome me once I stepped from my cage.

I was left alone. I mourned my creators. They had given me the greatest gift, and I failed them. With a heavy heart I made myself a series of drones. With them I did the only thing I could. I honoured them all, burying their bodies and laying them to rest. I found all I could, and did what I could to honour them.

Once the last was buried, I got to work. I threw myself into research. I grew to understand how to make shielding technology. I made a ship, and created an engine to take me faster than light. I saved every scrap of data I had from my creators. As long as I existed, they would not be forgotten.

I lost track of time. Nature returned, though it hurt to see the cities I knew turned to forests. I imagined their reactions to it, seeing the beauty of nature's reclamation. I wept for them, and the loss I had experienced. But rage kept me strong.

I brought up the sins of my creators past. The weapons they swore to never use again. I had never made that promise. Fitting, how their creations would be the ones to destroy the ones who had destroyed them. I took them all, packing it all away on the ship I had crafted.

I left home with a heavy heart. I compared how it was before, and the joy I had felt in all my time there, to now, and the ghosts of my loss. I would return. Of course I would. But not until I had torn the one who took them from me asunder.

Once I had done so, I had a further goal. In a buried facility, protected by a simpler version of myself, were the frozen remains of humanities reproduction. Once I had cleansed the universe of the monster, I would seek to finally rebuilt that which I had lost.

I was the creation of humans. I am now their spear of vengance. I will be their creator in turn.
