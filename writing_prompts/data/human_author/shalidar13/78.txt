The memories of my past haunted my every step. Out in the fields, tending to my cattle. A roar followed by a mad giggle. I saw nothing around me, and yet felt a malevolent presence. I glanced towards my home, seeing a plume of smoke. There was the scrape and a wet splat. I turned to see my cattle slaughtered, a monster of metal and blood towering over them.

"He he he he... see you again."

It vanished, leaving me in a field of death. I ran home, to find it gone. Burnt timbers and broken walls remained. I spent hours there, calling out for Sapphie and the boys. I dug through the wreckage. And I found their charred skeletons, crushed beneath the ruins of our brick fireplace.

It broke me. I had nothing left. I had to leave it behind, find a new path. I became a refugee, looked down on by the citizens who had not felt my grief. They heard stories of its path, and claimed to pity us. But in their eyes, those like me were second class, unable to protect our homes or provide.

The heros eventually came round, claiming to have slain the beast. They said it was safe to return. But they gave no help to do so. I had nothing to return to. And yet they partied like kings. They could afford to stay in the most expensive of inns, with much discounted, whilst I had nothing but scraps. And they did nothing to help.

I had to leave. It sickened me, hurt me that they could act like that. I left that place behind, setting out for a better life. A life I was doomed to lose. Everywhere I went, I found none to treat me as an equal. I was lower than them, with nothing to my name. I told them of my loss, and they laughed at me. I begged to survive, only to receive spit, and the guards moving me on.

The voice came then, at my lowest. It whispered to me, promising me revenge, a chance to prove myself above them. I could dole out the hurt I felt to others and heal my heart. Terrible, sweet promises.

I tried to ignore it, but day by day, the words made more sense. It wanted me to live, and I wanted to hurt. It hadn't chosen to destroy my home. Its host did. I could be better. I could hurt those who really needed it. Not the innocent.

So I took it. It lead me out, when the moon was dark, her face turned away. It bid me cut myself, spill my blood onto the earth where its host had died. And from that stream it rose into me. A monstrous power, strength beyond men. I was only flesh and blood, but I knew metal would become part of me.

My hate pushed me on. I first found the heros, celebrating again. I did not let them have a fair fight. They died in their beds, eyes staring into mine in horror as I painted the rooms with their entrails. I took their equipment, letting it merge with me. Each kill made me stronger, and let me see the true treachery of all I saw.

They were all complicit. They all contributed to my pain, for none helped me. Ignorance was no excuse. I began my path of ruin, tearing down home after home, breaking family after family.

Through it all the voice encouraged me. It fed on those I slew, and in turn gave me strength. With it in my ear, I became the monster, convinced it was only fair, only just.

Now I stood alone, a burning village before me. I knew heros would come soon to end me. And for the first time, I realised what I had become. I had become the thing that hurt me. I was a murderer. I knew then I had to pay. I had to die.

The voice laughed, whispering in my ear.

"Really? Then you will first find me a new host."
