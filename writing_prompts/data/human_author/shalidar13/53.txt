"Get out of my way."

A human stood before me. It shook in its armour. Correction, he shook in his armour. Gender roles. Had to remember that.

"Y-you a-aren-n-t w-w-welcome h-here."

It, his voice was thin. Panicked. A tone I knew well, having met many like it, him before. A human who stood up to me, utterly terrified of what I represented. I leaned down, feeling the creak of my bones.

"No? Then stop me."

I slowly drew my Dread Blade, letting smokelike liquid drip from it. It fell in screaming faces, faintly familiar to the living that saw it. The human shook, his face paling. Wait, I got it right that time, score one for me remembering.

The guard looked like he was going to. The hand on the spear tightened, eyes beginning to fill with determination. Until I twitched, and it... he jumped. The spears was dropped, and I watched him cower away from me.

"P-please d-d-don't kill m-me."

I leaned further down, at an unnatural angle.

"I wasn't going to, unless your fought back. Though you are smart. Funny, I'm not used to people using their brains for something. I always considered that to be a useless sack of meat."

The guard shook again. If I had eyes, I imagine that's when I would have rolled them. I assumed anyway. To be honest I wasn't sure how that worked. They always screamed when I removed their eyes, so sure it must hurt to roll them.

Shoving aside the tangent, I regarded the guard. I causally lifted them up, inspecting them. He moved feebly to push me off. I laughed at the display. So weak. All that meat and flesh, but they still couldn't beat me. At least the Corpse Twins knew how to use it. They were worth training with.

"I have heard of this thing called cuteness. You will show it to me, for sparing your life."

It... his, I did it again, face was utter confusion. Like the faces of those priests and clerics that appeared, when their weird light show didn't do anything. It still held the fear, but a question pushed through it.

"W-why cuteness?"

I shrugged, putting him down.

"I have heard of these feeling you humans speak so fondly of. They make you feel, and claim make you stronger. I wish to experience these feelings. Supposedly cuteness is a good start. So show me this cuteness."

He nodded. I waved a hand for him to go forwards, and I lumbered behind. I looked at the buildings all around, surprised that they still used wood to build. Didn't they know how weak it was? At least stone was a challenge. Mulling this over, I missed the running of feet, until a voice got my attention.

"Halt abomination!"

The guard before me froze as well. It... HIS face showed a flicker of hope, as he stared at something behind me. I turned, seeing a group of five more standing there. One had a plumage on its pathetic helmet, making it stand out.

"Begone, or we will cut you down!"

I let out a breath with no lungs, watching the air crackle at the pressure. I drew my Dread Blade again, relishing their fear. But before I could act I seized controlof myself. This wasn't the time for aggression. Not yet. If they died, who would show me these feelings.

"Leave me alone."

They shuddered at my words. Reality seemed to settle around them, as they realised just who I was.

"W-we can't."

I let out an approximation of a sigh. It seemed appropriate.

"All I want is to experience a feeling. If you let me try, I won't remove you from existence."

Yes. This was called batering I believe.

"W-what?"

I gave a sigh again. It seemed to fit from what I had witnessed. If these people would just get out of my way, I would be more in control. They didn't understand how much it was taking for me to not lash out right now.

"I will see cuteness. Show this cuteness to me, and you won't soil my blade."

They dithered, and I leaned down again.

"Your choice. Feeling for me, or death for you and everyone here. You can't beat me. You know that."

The guard I had initially terrified ran off. For a moment I wanted to cut it down for running. But I wrestled it down. I was content with towering over this latest group, until they either fought back or showed me such a thing. I was hoping for feeling, but I would take more soulless husks.

I could see them beginning to panic. They shivered in their armour, constantly adjusting grips on weapons. I could already imagine what it would be like to attack them, and destroy them utterly. But before it broke, I heard running again. I turned to see that guard coming again, holding something in it... his hands.

"T-t-this is c-cute."

I looked down. At first I saw just hair, until it moved. Surprise at his return drew my attention, but this thing. This... *small* thing held it. I saw it, and I didn't want to crush it. For the first time in my long and death filled experience, I saw something I wanted to hold.

Was, was this feeling?
