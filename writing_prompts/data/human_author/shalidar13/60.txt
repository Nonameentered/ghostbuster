"Seriously?"

I stepped in from retrieving an overdue book, expecting to see the usual order. Instead, there was chaos, books and scrolls strewn about. Some of the gorgeous bookcases were splintered and damaged, with singed pages completing the picture.

"Ah, [Sero](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/n98c31/wp_you_retrieve_overdue_books_for_a_library_as/gxn5462?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3), you are back!"

I looked at the harassed looking Receptionist. It was busy sorting out its desk, picking up the pile of scrolls for sale. I placed the [Principles of Time](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/v1rxhl/wp_you_are_the_librarian_of_a_magical_library/iaoxrqt?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) on its desk. It accepted it with a click, looking it over.

"I trust the delinquent was easy enough to handle?"

I narrowed my eyes at it.

"Simple enough. What happened here?"

It gave an irritated sigh, pulling up a list of titles.

"The Dark Lord. He decided that we shouldn't give out books willy-nilly. Apparently he thought a display of strength would make us think twice before acting against his interests. He did demand that we turn all these books over to him as well."

I took the list, looking it over. It was full of the strongest of tomes, many of which were locked away for good reason. I spoke deliberately as I read through them, shaking my head.

"What did you tell him?"

It gave a fanged smile.

"Oh, just that I didn't have the authority to, only a Librarian did. He left an address to meet him at to hand them over as well."

It took out another parchment, this time with a meeting spot. Devils Peak, a day from now at the start of the Witching Hour. I shook my head again.

"What an idiot. I assume he promised to do worse if he didn't get what he wanted?"

The Receptionist's smile widened.

"Indeed he did."

I let a vindictive grin out.

"Good."

\-----

I stood atop Devils Peak exactly ten minutes before the note had said. My Dictionary was in hand, chained to me as always. I casually flicked through the pages, waiting. The wind failed to shift my hair, even as it surged around the otherwise barren out cropping.

"I assume you have seen reason?"

A cocky voice came to me. I slowly looked up to see a figure in black robes walking up to me. On each side it was flanked by Butcher Demons. They were large, brutish demons, eight feet tall and nearly that wide. Thier red skin was taut over muscles, with a massive cleaver held in each hand.

Above it was a swarm of Chained Souls, silently wailing in agony. Their spectral grey forms swirled around, faces rolling around showing a screaming facade. I shook my head, turning another page.

"So you are the one that attacked my Library?"

The Dark Lord clicked its fingers, causing four lights to appear around its face. There I could see them to be a young man, with pale skin and straggly beard. A scar ran down the left hand side, standing out in the light.

"It was just some minor vandalism. If you want to see an attack, I will be more then happy to show you."

He gave a laugh, one awkwardly echoed by the Butcher Demons. I glared at them, and they flinched, subtly backing away. The Dark Lord seemed to pay them no mind, as they held out a hand.

"Are you going to give me those books?"

I ran my finger down the page, resting it against a word.

"No."

His face twisted into anger, purple fire rising from his palm.

"Fool! I will take those books, and you will suffer for defying me!"

With a snap of his hand the ball of flames came charging towards me. I watched, smirking as they hit the edge of my field of Invulnerability.

"You really shouldn't have done that. **Banish**."

The Butcher Demons faded away, grateful looks on their faces. The Dark Lord gave a cry, pointing a finger at me.

"Souls! Add her to your midst!"

They gave a screech, swarming towards me. I flipped through my Dictionary, letting it open to the perfect page.

"**Rest**."

Their wailing stopped, agony replaced by peaceful smiles. The twisting mass came apart, as each soul left to whatever afterlife they were taken from. He raged, summoning a bolt of black lightning.

"Just die!!"

My smirk faded. I swiftly went through the pages, picking out a few words.

"**Chain**."

Golden chains appeared around him, binding him in place.

"**Drain**."

He gasped, as the power that filled him was ripped from his body, released into the air.

"**Brand**."

He screamed, as the sound of sizzling flesh filled the air. His forehead turned red, then black, as the symbol of the Lirary emblazoned itself on him.

"For your actions against our institute, you are hearby struck from our visitor list. Poena!"

I heard the familiar rushing sound, with the night lit by a pillar of fire. The familiar worm form of my colleague appeared, its three arms holding various sharp instruments.

"Librarian Sero! I assume you have found the culprit."

I pointed to the crying, bound form tmof the Dark Lord.

"That one. Are there many books beyond repair?"

He shook his head sadly.

"Even one would be too many. At least the originals are intact."

I gave a nod.

"Take this one. He will pay for what he has done."

Poena gave a sadistic grin.

"Excellent. I was running low on fresh materials."

He slithered over, sliding one of his instruments into his body to hold it in place. With his now free hand he pressed it into the bound form, taking the sobbing fool with him. I turned away, heading back to the Library. I really wish they would learn.
