I raised my eyebrow. I wsnt sure what his name would be, but Death certainly didn't seem to fit. After a moment I nodded, looking down at his awfully pale face.

"Thats an interesting name. I'm Daniela. I'm glad to see you are awake."

His eyes flitted around, taking in the pale blue walls and white furniture of my spare bedroom. He licked his lips, speaking again in his quiet voice.

"Where am I?"

I leaned over, feeling his forehead with the back of my hand. His skin was cool to the touch, a stark change from the fever he had been experiencing.

"You are in my home. I would have taken you to the hospital, but before you lost consciousness you said not to."

His head dipped in a shallow nod. I smiled, relieved that he was coherent. My biggest worry had been that I would do more harm than good. The fact that he was awake eased my concerns.

"Thank you."

I patted Death's cheek, standing up.

"You're welcome. Now that you are awake, would you care for something to eat? I have a few soups, but didn't know if you were vegan or not, or had any allergies."

His mouth curled up very slightly.

"Yes please. Vegan if you have it please, but anything will do."

I nodded, turning to leave.

"No problem, I will be right back."

I left, heading for my kitchen. I looked over what I had, settling on a tin of vegetable soup. A look over the ingredients didn't show any animal sourced ingredients, with the label stating it was vegan friendly. I heated it up, anxious to get back and make sure he ate it. I put his phone on the tray, taking it with me as I returned.

He had pulled himself upwards a bit in bed. He was still pale, but his eyes were open and attentive. With care I put the tray on his lap, not wanting to splash any of his soup.

"Here you go. Vegetable soup from a tin, I'm not going to make you risk my cooking."

He smiled at my joke, slowly lifting an arm to the tray. It was slow, but the spoon didn't drake as he lifted it to his mouth, drinking it quietly.

"This is lovely. Thank you."

I smiled back at him, before pointing at his phone.

"I charged your phone by the way. I expected someone to ring, but no-one has."

He gave a nod, still moving at glacial speeds with drinking.

"They won't have, I wouldn't worry. We often go weeks without speaking."

I nodded, frowning at it. I hated the idea of him alone, without anyone to check up on him.

"Well, you enjoy your soup. I have some things to do, but I will be back to clear up in a bit. If you need me, just shout."

Death nodded, delicately picking up his phone.

"Thank you."

I left, mind cycling to the washing I needed to do. I could relax a bit more now, without having an unconscious person preying on my mind. Though as I walked away, I overheard him speak.

"Hey War, you'll never guess what's happened."
