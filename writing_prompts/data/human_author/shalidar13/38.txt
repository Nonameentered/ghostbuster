We had been together a long time by now. First as friends whilst growing up, we couldn't deny there was a connection. At first it was laughed off. We would tease the other about having a crush. Until I realised that yes, I did want to be more than friends.

We supported each other as we finished college. I had specialised in animal welfare, she in technology. I knew she was brighter than I, but I didn't really care. I loved her, and she loved me. That is what mattered. Our differences didn't make us weak, but rather allowed us to support the other.

She never told me where she worked. Not that I minded, apparently it was top secret stuff. Far too much for me to want to get involved in. But something was off. She would come home late, sometimes moving stiffly. She would always brush it off as a bad day at work, but I worried.

It came to a head one day. I had it off, relaxing at home. We had agreed to get takeaway, a rare treat for us. I kept an ear out, the menu and phone by my side so I could order as soon as she got in. I heard the familiar rumble of her engine, smiling as she opened the front door.

"Welcome home sweetheart!"

I lazily spun around, laying on my front to look at her. But in place of her usual lazy clothes, I saw her wearing a blood red lab coat, with a tight fitting bodysuit underneath. A matrix of wires ran up the side of her head, wrapping around her eyes and mouth. All she was missing was an ant-shaped mask, and she would be Malware.

"Hi honey, did you have a good day?"

I slowly nodded, confusion on my face.

"I did... um, is there a costume party I don't know about?"

She frowned, cocking her head to the side. I pointed to her outfit.

"It's a good one, I must admit."

She looked down, and her face went white. She began to shake, and my instinct took over. I leapt up, folding her into my arms. I was smaller than her, but she said my hugs were more than big enough.

"It's OK. It's OK. I'm here, calm down. You can talk to me."

The pieces slotted together in my head. The reason for her secrecy, and the pain she was sometimes in. I hugged her tight, whispering.

"You're Malware aren't you?"

She nodded, hugging me back. I sighed, squeezing as tight as I could.

"Yes... I'm sorry, I didn't mean for you to find out like this."

I smiled though she couldn't see me. I had questions, that much was true. But first and foremost, she needed me. I was hardly going to abandon her.

"Shhh, its fine. Go have a shower, and I will order food. Then you can explain all this to me."

I heard a sniff, and she pulled back a litte, eyes glimmering. I gave her a light kiss, before releasing her and giving a light smack on her rear.

"Go on, go."

She gave a damp giggle, wiping the tears from her eyes.

"Yes Mistress."

I stuck my tongue out, heading to the phone. I took a small detour, retrieving iur bottle of emergency tequila. I had a feeling we were going to need it.
