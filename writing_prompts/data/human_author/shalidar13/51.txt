The first thing I noticed at the point of impact was a group of birds. Seeing multiple starlings in one place was hardly a surprise. They were known to flock together. What did surprise me was the position they were in. Rather than on the ground, or maybe even swirling around, they were frozen in midair, in the middle of flying over.

It was utterly bizarre. But as I drew closer to the centre, I saw other strange things. Grass had grown over the thrown up dirt, already deep enough to have not been cut for a few weeks. But before my eyes it wilted, turning brown and disappearing. After the barest of seconds, it grew again.

The rock itself was covered in spider webs. I could see rapidly moving specks darting around it, their architects unable to stop. Each pass laid more of the web, though curiously they left one side untouched. The side I happened to be approaching from.

The meteorite seemed to call to me. It was like a craving, one unable to be ignored. I had to investigate it. I had no choice. With anxious fingers I reached out, touching the side of its rocky surface.

At my touch it crumbled into sand, eroding away at the space rock. The debris poured out, creating a hole to its core. It was small, but just big enough to fit my arm in. Again, my gut told me to stick my arm in. Before I could think of how inane of an idea that was, I was already reaching.

I felt something warm within. Almost to the point of being uncomfortable, but not quite. It was hard, with regular flat sides and smooth edges. I worked my hand around its tennis ball sized shape, slowly bringing it out.

From inside the meteorite's core came a pure white crystal. I looked it over, trying to understand just what it was. As I regarded it, the crystal seemed to vibrate, before the world spun away from me. I flailed around, a chaotic mess of images surrounding me. All of a sudden it stopped, and I saw a stream of white beneath.

It had a name, one I knew as soon as I saw it. This was the Time Stream, the centre of our universe. It extended far beyond view both directions, an inconceivablely long line. With a jolt my view shifted again, to the very edge of the stream. Whilst for above it was a single smooth stream, up close it was a mass of different threads.

One of these curled outwards, breaking away from the main core. It tried to create a new branch, but it was too weak. It snapped off, the broken pieces binding together. They wrapped and tightened, forming a small white crystal.

The vision changed again. This time the crystal was in the forefront. Around it, I saw clocks run forwards and backwards. It controlled each one, making it change however it chose. It changed once more, and now I saw myself holding it. I watched myself manipulate time. I saw myself age, and the crystal growing darker. Then I crumpled, and the now black crystal shattered.

With a wrench I found myself back before the meteorite, holding the crystal. I understood it now. This was a fragment of time itself. It had chosen me as its bearer. Nothing could break this bond, save the end of my life. But with this, I could change the flow of time around whatever I wanted.
