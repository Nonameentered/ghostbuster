I woke up to the same view as always. Ilazeal sleeping next to me, her beautiful face in utter peace. I smiled, kissing her forehead and sliding out of bed. It was a chilly morning, and a part of me wanted to stay next to her. Unfortunately, work had other plans.

I got ready as quickly as I could, warming myself up as I did so. As I brewed a fresh pot of coffee, I heard movement from behind. A moment later her arms encircled my waist, and I felt lips on the back of my neck.

"Morning love."

I leaned into her, smiling.

"Hey honey. Did you sleep well?"

"Like an angel."

Her words came with her usual good humour. I grinned wider, rubbing her arm.

"Good good."

She let me go to start making some toast, and I sighed. To think we could enjoy such pleasantries, after the things we had experienced. The human world was a wealth of new sights, tastes and sounds.

We had a simple meal of toast, bacon and  beans, nice and filling to start the day with. Once done it was off to work for me, climbing into my van. I had found work at a construction site, where my otherworldly strength meant I was a fast and efficient worker. I made sure to keep it toned down, but otherwise worked hard.

I was having a break when I noticed Ilazeal had rung me. I smiled, calling her back.

"Garidal!"

She shouted as she answered. Behind I could hear the crackle of flames, and a pained grunt.

"Ilazeal! What's happening?! Are you ok?!"

"I'm fine!"

There was a thud, and her voice drifted away from the phone.

"Get out of my house, you damned gull!"

She returned to it, still in her fight mood.

"You need to get home now. They found us!"

I instantly looked around. My greatest fear was realised. I couldn't go back, not after this taste of freedom.

"How did- no, not the time. I'm on my way, which side did?"

She muttered darkly, a shrieking chorus echoing the words. I could hear a rattle of chains, white breaking glass.

"Your side of the family. Get home, now. We have to run."

The line cut off. I looked around again. No-one was paying attention to me. That was good news I hoped. If they had only found our home, then we could run. I walked quickly to my van, ignoring the looks I was getting. I had to go.

I drove quickly, at the speed limit. Asmuch as I wanted to get home soon, I didn't want to draw any additional attention to myself. Human intervention would only make things worse.

I drew closer, seeing a column of smoke. Sirens were coming, I could hear them as I turned into the road. There I saw our house enveloped in flames. Everything in there was probably gone. All of our possessions.

The door burst open, and Ilazeal came running out. Her clothes were burnt, but her fiendish blood kept her safe. I threw open the door, letting her dive in before accelerating away. In the mirror I saw a singed figure step out from the blaze.

"Go go go."

I obeyed. But as I did I reached out with a hand, rubbing the top of her head. She leant into it, both of us finding comfort in each others presence.

"What happened?"

Ilazeal picked at her ruined clothes, muttering darkly before replying.

"I was on a call with work, and the doorbell went. I was expecting a parcel, and this angel was disguised as a delivery person. Luckily I smelt him as I opened the door, and dodged the ray he sent my way. Unfortunately it hit a clothes horse, and everything went up in smoke. I was just able to call you around dodging his attacks."

I glanced at her, slightly panicked.

"He didn't touch you did he?"

She frowned, shaking her head.

"Not me. My clothes yes, but not me."

I drove faster.

"We need to change it then. If he touched it, he can track it for a time."

She pulled it off, chucking it from the window as we drove. Clad in her underwear she crossed her arms, before pausing.

"Wait, is that why I have never been able to sneak up on you?"

I gave a small chuckle, as we left stability behind.

"Maybe."
