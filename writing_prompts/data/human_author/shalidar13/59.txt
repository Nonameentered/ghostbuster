I sighed, coming to the end of this painting. This set was called Serva's Corruption, a series of paintings showing one of my servants change from man to demon. I was proud of this one, showing the twisted intellect in their fiendish form. Once the paint had dried it would make a fine gift to them, a reward for their loyalty and servitude.

As I stepped back, I felt the ground rumble. On instinct I summoned my armour, feeling it morph around me as the wall exploded. I froze as paintings fell, some torn to pieces. But worst hit was my most recent set. The explosion sent shards tearing through canvas, utterly destroying them.

"At last, we have found you!"

I slowly looked up to see the heroes, looking mightily pleased with themselves. Dramna, the farmhand-turned-knight, stood at their forefront. His silver armour was edged with gold, a gift from the royals I hadn't yet subjugated. His long time love interest Ferno stood to his side, holding a glowing rod. He wore robes and vestments of the Dawn bringer, wrapped in holy light.

To the other side stood a woman in baggy brown clothes. Her hair was pulled into a messy bun, with a hand supporting an open book. She was Gola, one of the arcane blessed. Finally, Orno loomed over them. The ogre wore fine tailored clothing, holding an enormous bow with spears repurposed into arrows. They were the one who had sworn to defeat me.

I knew them to say that friendship was what let them push through. I couldn't deny it, as I cultivated it in my followers. But I didn't need that power right this second. Seeing my most recent painting fall open from a tear was enough for me.

"You. You dare! YOU DARE!"

I shouted, rage pumping through my body. This wasn't the power I used, normally being careful and refined. But they had ruined one of the few things I truly cared for meant I had no time for such niceties. With a wave I encased my works in black orbs, protecting them from what was about to come.

Dramna had a look of confusion on his simple face. He opened his mouth, and asked the most moronic question I had ever heard.

"Um, what did we do?"

I didn't dignify it with a verbal answer. Instead he got a snarl, and I lashed out. First came an illusionary fireball, letting them clump up under Ferno's protective aura. But they had no time to react to it being fake before my actual spell took hold.

The rubble formed into a massive ball, hitting them as they blinked from the bright light. I was gratified to see a look of shock, before they were thrown from the side of my castle. I jumped down to follow them, rage urging me onwards.

I done through the air, activating a flight spell to give me speed. The first I reached was Gola, as she frantically wove a spell to slow her fall. Her eyes widened as I caught up, and she clutched at her book. I snarled again, reaching out to grasp it. With a vindictive satisfaction I tore it from her hands, before grasping the pages inside. They made a beautiful confetti as they were torn out, echoed by a horrified scream.

Dramna and Ferno had linked together as they fell, Ferno concentrating on saving them. I rushed at them, ducking at the last second to head to Orno. I didn't care to take anything from him. Rather, I ploughed into his chest, driving him towards the ground faster. I appreciated my choice of having my castle on a floating rock, as I rammed Orno into the ground.

Bones broke, and blood spurted as flesh ripped open. My armour protected me, but made things all the worse for my ogre cushion. I pulled myself from his ruined body, as Dramna and Ferno closed to the ground. Their speed slowed, gently setting them down. A moment later came another crash, as Gola landed with gruesome impact. I gave a horrible grin as the two survivors realised their predicament.

"You... you monster! You will pay for this."

I laughed at them, fury still coursing through my body.

"You ruined my love. I ruin yours."

I didn't bother with fancy spells or intricate weapon work. I pumped power into my fists and arms, letting my inner brute out. Dramna charged with his sword raised, vengeful tears in his eyes. I knocked it to the side, punching hard into his chest. The sheer strength of my fury overcame the wards within, crushing it into his chest. His eyes bulged, lungs no longer able to inflate.

Ferno shook, holding up his rod. He sent a beam of light towards me, crying out in anguish. I let the shadow of my armour absorb it, racing towards him. Fingers closed over his throat, and I lifted him into the air.

"You act like you are so good, yet you ruin things without thought."

With that I let the darkness within flow into his body. He bucked and twisted, as it fought with his holy light. I stood there, slowly forcing it into him. He fought it for as long as he could, but it was a wall against the sea. Soon he fell still, as I burned his soul out.

With a dismissive wave I dropped his body, looking at the carnage. I had hoped to have a masterful showdown with them, but in some ways I liked this more. I sent a message to my right hand woman, looking back up to my home.

"Desvira, there are some bodies down below I need cleaning up."
