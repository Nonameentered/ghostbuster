The Order of the Frozen Rose. It was a name that the common man praised, and the evil men despised. They were a group who sought to protect all, enforcing peace and allowing prosperity.

Their influence was felt far and wide. In near every city on the mainland you could find a building of theirs. It would be populated day and night, with both the powerful and the weak there. Some would go in to join the Order, others were there merely to learn from them.

They had existed for centuries, acting for the betterment of all civilisation. No-one outside the order knew how they came to be, nor who kept them together. But whoever it was was clearly an important figure to them. When spoken of, they were always referred to as the One Who Holds Our Love.

The truth was the One Who Holds Our Love was a spirit, bound in a column of enchanted ice. It took the form of a young girl, with infinitely kind and compassionate eyes. She would encourage and commiserate, and make people be the best they could.

She was bound to the ice, unable to leave its frozen core. She didn't mind this, for whilst the outside world was interesting, all she truth cared about was her Order.

But they were all betrayed. A new member of the Order had been kidnapped, years before they joined. A dark wizard tortured and broke them, making them into a sleeper agent. They would go out and join the Order, unknowing of the Wizard's designs. Once they met the core, they were to stab the One Who Holds Our Love.

It happened flawlessly. The new member met the frozen spirit, and immediately stabbed her. His sword broke the enchanted ice, only able to be broken by one who had sworn and oath to her. She cried as her home shattered, and her form dissolved without its reinforced hold.

The Order broke overnight. Each member felt her death, no matter how far away. They gave cries and screams of their own, vengeance burning on their lips. The unfortunate member was bound, interrogated to find out why. The mages found the Dark Wizard's spells, as the new member finally died after weeks of torment.

They focused their hatred on the Wizard. Where once they marched for peace, now they marched for war. Their building fell silent and abandoned. Peacekeeping efforts were cast aside. Even as they tore down the Wizard, ripping apart everything he had worked for, he laughed at them. His great work was done. Even after his death, the Order of the Frozen Rose would be no more.
