There was a crash of thunder, and the creature jumped. It huddled down in its bush, shivering. Rain lashed down, turning dirt into mud. The creature was so cold. It had lost home days ago, when it's parents were killed. Its fur was matted and filthy, its small green eyes screwed tightly shut.

Movement drew its attention. It heard the muttering of people, similar to those it had seen visiting the forest. From its small shelter it watched one of the people walk over, picking up wet wood. Another crash of thunder startled the creature, making it squeal.

The sound drew the person's attention. They instantly stared at the bush, reading the situation. Fear made the creature shiver more, passing into the bush and making it shake. The person watched and waited, ready in case a fight was about to start. Eventually they moved, heading to the bush.

"Hello?"

Their voice had concern. The creature looked at them, thinking in its small mind. It wanted to be safe again. Maybe the person would give it that.

"Look at you. It's OK, I won't hurt you little one."

The person reached out, gently brushing the creatures fur. It felt comfort in that touch, and a promise of kindness. With hope in its heart the creature purred, rubbing against the person's fingers. Its stomach dropped as they snatched it up, before purring again as it was tucked into the front of the person's clothing. The warmth from their body fed into the little creature's half frozen form, beating back a slowly creeping death.

It's memory went hazy for a bit then. It heard talking and laughter. A soft blanket on its back, and a bowl of fresh fruits. It felt their care, filling it with joy. One word stood out to it. Wittle. Not just a word, but a name. A name of its own.

\-----

It grew up with them, across their adventures. It found itself, a Forest Guardian. It kept itself small, even though its mind grew. It loved its adopted family, and how they played with it. It loved the little helmet they had made it, something it never went without. Wittle was happy with them, helping out in little ways across their adventures.

Now it stood alone again. Its family were lying on the ground, defeated. Over them stood Hanvel, the Crazed Smith. He sought to rule their world with his golems and creations. Wittle's family had tried to stop him, but he was too strong.

Wittle looked at its family. For the first time in its new life, it felt the fear of being alone again. It fed into anger, and the cute creature decided it was enough. It stood against the villain, snarling. As it did, it finally grew.

It started the size of a puppy, as it had been when found. But soon it passed the size of a adult dog, with no hint of slowing. Wittle continued to grow, taking up the mantle of its birth. Soon it stood over Hanvel, with its rage pouring off it. It gave a hiss, rearing back with a claw.

It would not lose its family again.
