"Where are youuuuu?"

It's voice rang out through the woods. I shivered, huddled behind a tree. My breath came in short, sharp sounds, deafening to me in the otherwise silent night. Sticks crunched as the thing slowly stalked nearby. I could almost feel its gaze wandering around, burning into the darkness.

I peeked around my tree, looking at my salvation. A house, it's door hanging open. In there was safety. In there I could defend myself. I glanced around, seeing its shadowy form slowly skulk away, calling out as it did so.

"Come out come out wherever you areeeee"

I shook my head silently. I would not lose. I couldn't. I just had to make one last dash. I waited until it was out of sight, crouching down ready. I took a deep breath, before burst out of my hiding spot. I kept as quiet as I could, but the world betrayed me.

My foot caught on a protruding root. Unbalanced I crashed to the ground, involuntarily groaning. I tried to suck it in, but it was too late. I heard the screech, and thudding as it ran towards me. Adrenaline rushed through my blood, forcing me up. I had no time to hide. I just had to run.

And run I did. The sounds of pursuit forced me faster, knowing what would happen if I got caught. The house drew closer. I was so close. Just a few more seconds, and I would make it.

Before I did, a pair of oversized hands hit my sides, long spindly fingers wrapping around me. They lifted me up, a third hand with talons gripping my head. I tried to fight, elicting a horrid laugh from it.

"Got youuuuu!"

I stared into its face. The skin sagged, a pale imitation of human flesh. Its eyes were too big, about the size of my palm, whilst it's nose was almost non existent. A mouth of sharp black teeth grinned at me, as a security light from the house turned on. I could see its overly skinny body with saggy skin, two pairs of arms connected to its torso. It matched them with two pairs of legs, claws in place of toes.

"Now you seek and *I* hide."

It put me down, giggling to itself. I briefly flashed a smile, holding up a hand as I calmed my heart rate.

"I know... I know... just give me... a moment..."

It nodded, crouching down next to me. I heard movement  from the house, floorboards creaking. With a raisied eyebrow I looked inside, my brother appearing.

"Sup loser."

I went to raise my finger at him, before thinking better of it. The monster beside me whistled, running up to him. He laughed as it enveloped him with its arms, gently patting it on the back.

"Hey sweetheart, did you beat her again?"

It nodded, giggling.

"I did! She nearly won, but I'm fast!"

I rolled my eyes, sighing.

"You are, but it's not exactly fair when you have twice the number of legs that I do."

It turned, poking a segmented tongue at me. I gave her a look, shaking my head in mock admonishment.

"Don't be rude. Now go hide, I will count to ten."

It giggled again, jumping away from my brother and dashing into the night. I looked at him, shaking my head.

"I'm getting too old for this."

He laughed, cracking his neck.

"Poor baby. But it is near her bed time, so one last round."

I nodded, looking out into the night. All I had to do was find her, or she had to get to the house. I nodded to him, and jogged off in a vague direction. Whilst she had the advantage of speed, she had yet to work out how to keep quiet. So I just listened for her giggles.

It was hard work being the favourite aunt of a monster.
