"Sooooo, how come you're joining up with a bunch of losers like us?"

I smiled, adjusting the bag on my back. A thud followed those words, as Trista hit her brothers arm. The pair of them were dressed in some off the shelf leather armour. Trista had a bow and arrows, keen eyes picking up the faintest of animal tracks. Himon, he held a spear, one he was used to using. I knew he was trained as a town's guard, but had only recently decided to take the life of an adventurer instead.

Sinolo shook her head, petting the feathers of her owl familiar. She saw more than I thought a novice mage could, hers eyes hanging on me more than once. I had a hunch that she knew my secret, but so far she hadn't blabbed. I chose not to confront her, letting her wonder.

"Simple Himon, I like going out with parties like you. You need some experience, and I am well placed to help with that."

Trista elbowed him, making him grunt.

"What he was trying to say... why haven't you kept a party? Couldn't you make more money that way? Get more fame?"

I shook my head.

"I could, but what need do I have for more money? I made enough years back, so now I do this for fun. Plus, I help people get stronger. Who knows, you three might be the next World Saviours."

I couldn't tell them the truth of course. I was a slime, having my own adventure in the world of the humanoids. I had money from all those times people had come into the dungeon I lived in, and had proceeded to die. Fame would be a bad thing. The more eyes on me, the more likely I would be seen slipping up.

"Yeah right, I'll just be happy if I am still alive to tell stories to the guys back home. Heck, maybe be the captain of the guard in my retirement."

Himon joked, already planning for the future. I smiled, hoping it would be the case for him. I liked it when they got back safe.

"Sinolo, how you doing?"

I turned my head to her, making sure not to go too far. I had done that before, forgetting the limitations of bones and muscle.

"I'm fine thanks, walking isn't too hard, it's the running I'm not so good at."

I gave her a tiny nod, before sighing.

"I get you. But you should learn how to. Part of being a good adventurer is knowing when to run. Trust me, I know."

I felt the stare on me. I sighed again, as they all waited for my story.

"Alright, geez you guys have the inquisitive look down to a fine art. Back when I first started out, I was with a team much like you three. Himon, I was basically like you. Eager to prove my worth."

Memories came back to me. The first fledgling friendships I had made.

"We went to deal with a goblin camp, a pretty standard job. But, what we didn't know was this one had allied with an ogre tribe nearby."

I sighed, thinking back to that day.

"The others, they were confident. There were only two ogres they said. It would be easy they said, as we watched the camp. The thing is, the hunting party wasn't there. One that made up most of their force."

I remembered the screams, and the blood that came out of them.

"They were unlucky. They were meant to be away from the fight, unlike me. So when the hunters came back, their backs were exposed. I heard their bones break, and found myself alone. And I ran."

It wasn't the full story, but they couldn't know the truth. They couldn't know how I collapsed my form, becoming a puddle to flee. I forced out a couple of water droplets, leaking from my eyes.

"It still hurts. I've grown since then. I know now I could save them. But I can't go back. So I spend time teaching you youngsters what to do, so you don't face the same fate."

I hoped they would listen. From their faces, it looked like they were. That was good. I hoped we didn't fight anything that would make me do that again. I was meant to be their comrade. Becoming a puddle would be the ultimate betrayal.
