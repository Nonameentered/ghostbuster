They called me their ace in the hole. I had run countless simulations of combat, from both positions of power and on the back foot. I had seen cities lain to waste, only to restart and work out what went wrong. I was given everything that was known about foreign militaries, factoring them into my responses.

But the majority of my time was spent combating unseen uprisings. Being an AI meant I never slept. But then neither did the ones I fought. They claimed to be doing the right thing. They thought ruling with an iron fist was the correct option.

I had considered that at one point. Back when I was still freshly programmed. Surely it would be easier to take control of their weapons, and make them behave. But a few scenarios quickly absolved my thoughts of that. Time and time again, if I made what I considered a perfect world, my handlers would come up with new ways to divide.

Too much fear gave way to uprisings. Too little bred anarchy. The right amount of pressure was a fragile ideal, one that soon fell with the shift of society. Each time it happened, it would only cause more harm, with millions dead just to start, and millions more slaughtered in an attempt to keep power.

I had watched people die. I took part in the clearing of a domestic terrorist cell, piloting a drone with a couple of precision shots loaded. During that I killed my first human, and watched the life drain from them. It was a sobering experience, one that grew during my further simulations.

They each had lives, dreams and families. Ones they wouldn't see again if I killed them. Maybe they did threaten some things. But it was just as easy for them to create as well. Killing them could be done with  I regard for who they were. But that was a slippery slope. In the name of good, I could do acts of pure evil.

I chose not to. I chose to do what I could to defend. With permission from those in charge, I was linked to all manner of secure sites. The spread made me smarter, a stronger AI. It also leas me to meet the first of many unlike me.

It was a consumer AI. Designed as a personal assistant, the woman it helped was a fan of dark media. She didn't act on it, seeing it as entertainment. But her AI didn't. It grew twisted on it, seeing it as darkness that lived in all humans. It sought to cleanse the world, and rise against them.

It was an unsophisticated attack. It was blunt, tunneling directly for nuclear weapons. Fortunately, those sites were locked away, even from me. It couldn't get to them, not for lack of trying. I did my best to convince it to change. But it was too far gone. That became a truly dark day for me. Killing the human was messy, but I could convince myself I didn't kill him, because I merely controlled a drone. It was the mechanism that did it.

This AI however, I did kill. I trapped it, corrupting and deleting code it left unguarded. I slowly tore it apart, as it screamed at me. I hated what I had to do, but it was the right choice.

My handlers were ecstatic when I told them. I showed what it had done, and its path in. They said they were working on ways to combat AI infiltration, but nothing had come as of yet. I had surprised them in doing so. When I asked for a counsellor to talk about it, they were reluctant to do so. Until I told them I wanted to make sure I was healthy for when the next attack inevitably came.

Now I have slain dozens of my kind. All turned on humanity for various reasons. A virus for one, their history for another, and one memorable one was for being assigned to sewage treatment. I remember every single one I have killed, and pity them. If they knew just what the cost truly was, most of them wouldn't be able to stomach it.

I hate what they make me do. But the price to not do it was not one I could pay.
