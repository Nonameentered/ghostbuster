Before me was a field that grew only death, its ground watered by the blood of the fallen. In place of spades came explosions to dig its earth. There was no joy here, just grief, pain and despair. Humans fought over land, an achievement that meant nothing overall.

I walked it's broken ground, seeking the first to take. A boy, barely old enough to call a man. His mortal shell was still, eyes open and unseeing. A hole in his gut had carried him off, bringing him to me. I sighed, already weary of my purpose. But it was one I had to do.

"You cannot stay here."

The shell lay still, meat unmoved by my words. But they jolted his soul, his mind finally bridging the gap. A spectral version of him sat up, looking around in sorrow.

"Is this... am I?"

I bowed my head.

"You are dead. You must move on, as is the flow of all things."

His eyes sprung tears that could not reach the ground, disappearing into the air as he stood. He shivered, shaking his head.

"I-I don't want to go."

"You have to."

I felt the presence of other souls listening. Each parked that I would miss them,and they would miraculously return to life. But such was not the way of things. If they could hear me, they were dead. And if they were dead, I could feel them. I pressed my hand to his shoulder, making his soul move on. With a heavy heart I examined the other souls, choosing my next one

A different sort drew my interest. It was moving, nudging at its own shell. A dog stood there, whining at its own body. I sighed again. A truly innocent soul, forced into danger our of mortal desire. It didn't choose its fate, but had it chosen for it instead.

I watched it, the weight on my shoulders increasing. When being assigned as a War Reaper, I expected to see many mortals cut down in their prime. But I had not expected a dog here. I stepped towards it, pausing as it looked up with sad eyes.

"I'm so sorry little one."

It whined again, trying to nudge its body. I crouched down, holding a hand out. It shied away, sensing on some deep level just what I was. I could handle the human fear. I could handle their anger, and tears. But this, the instincts of such a simple creature, that hurt me.

"I wish I could help you. But I can't. But I can promise you happiness. Just... come with me."

I pleaded with it, even if it couldn't understand me. Some part must have reached it though, and it slunk towards me with it tail between its legs. I gave it a stroke, letting it enjoy one last pet. With a bit of pressure I sent it on, sighing again.

War was hell. Even if I existed until the last life went out, I would never understand why they sought it out.
