The crypt is dark and quiet. It has been for a long time now. Ever since… well ever since they locked me in here some 4500 years ago. But that’s nothing to me, the noble guardian of Ze’pho’nad’s final resting place.
  

  
A shiver ran through my senses as their tiny little hands clawed at the entrance of the crypt. I could feel their metal tools prying at the large stones. But I knew they’d never get in. Their primitive little technicality would never be enough to….
  

  
Stone grinded against stone as the entrance slid open. 
  

  
They’d done it. Somebody had actually gone and done it! I thought. I finally get to do something!
  

  
Body tingling with anticipation, I tried out a few foams. 
  

  
First a great trilurk. Surely its massive pincer arms would scare the absolute shiitake out of anyone who came in here!
  

  
No, no, no, I reminded myself. Trilurks are so last millennium. So old hat. Modern people have modern needs. And modern problems call for modern solutions. 
  

  
A shebasiliar! I thought. Powerful legs, huge claws, ferocious teeth! But just as I took that foam I remembered something. Thick thighs and imposing physiques are In right now…. I might get a date before I scare anyone to death! 
  

  
I was so distracted thinking about what to wear, I hardly noticed the four grave robbers were already halfway through the first chamber.
  

  
“This is incredible, professor!” The young blonde said as she trailed behind an older bearded man. 
  

  
“Incredible!?” He huffed, “this is the single greatest discovery in human history! I think ‘incredible’ falls a bit flat my dear!”
  

  
“I’m sorry professor… I just thought” she mewed like a wounded puppy. 
  

  
“I don’t pay you to think!” The man snapped, “I pay you to bask in my greatness!”
  

  
“Holy guacamole Batman!” I said to Druce Wayne my favorite resident bat. “This guy tweak’in like crazy! Why hasn’t he been canceled yet!?”
  

  
“He’s on that sigma male grind set!” He replied, reminding me of an important truth. I was talking to myself again.
  

  
But now I didn’t have to. Now after 4500 years, there were real people to interact with. I rubbed my hands together after finally selecting a new form. 
  

  
This was going to be good!
