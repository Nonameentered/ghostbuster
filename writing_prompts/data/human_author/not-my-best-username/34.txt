Part 2

“What can I get you?” Shaw asked, trying his best to keep the worry he was feeling from showing on his face. “Whisky? Bourbon? A white wine?”

“No sir. nothing quite so strong!” the women smiled. “I’m looking for answers.”

“Answers!?” Shaw responded returning with the best smile he could manage. “Well in that case”—he reached into a compartment under the bar, navigated his hand past his gun, and retrieved a red and black leather menu which he handed it to the woman—“Everything you need to know is right in there. And yes, the pasta is gluten-free.”

A mix of amusement and surprise flashed across her face. She couldn't quite tell if he was kidding or just trying to wind her up. Either way, she instinctively took the menu out of his hand and looked it over. Forgetting just for a moment her reason for being there.

A second later she placed the menu facedown on the oak countertop, slid it away from herself, and took a seat on one of the vacant stools.

Two of the men sitting at the bar beside her looked at each other uncomfortably. Each no doubt asking themselves a similar question: Would it look suspicious If I were to leave so suddenly after she arrived? Or was it be more dangerous to share a drink with a potential enemy?

“I think there's been a miss understanding so let me be clear”—She reached into her jacket pocket and flashed her FBI badge—” May name is Smatha-”

“Sterling” Shaw interrupted, hoping to rattle the young agent just a bit,  “and according to this badge you work for the FBI!”

“That’s right!” she said. “I’m here in connection with a missing person case and-”

“You expect to find them in my bar?” Shaw cut her off a second time.

“Well, not exactly!” She said before pausing as she worked out what to say next.

Seizing this opportunity Shaw took control of the conversation.“Not to be rude but, aren't you a little young to be an FBI agent? I thought the FBI were a bunch of grey hair spooks in twenty-dollar black suits.”

Agent sterling could help but smile at the characterization. He wasn't half wrong.

“I guess you’re right,” she admitted, “but somebody has to tie up those pesky loose ends. Which brings me here today”—she slid a small laminated picture of a man faceup across the bar—“have you seen this man before?”

Shaw looked at the photo without tilting his head. “Can’t say that I remember him.”—He shrugged—“All sorts come and go. I’m a bit too old to remember all those faces.”

“But I’m sure that remembers,” she responded pointing with a finger to the camera mounted on the wall behind the bar.

Shaw scratched the back of his head. “Unfortunately that’s more for show than anything else. It’s been on the frits for a while now and I haven’t gotten around to having it fixed. I’ve never been too good with those computers.”

“That’s too bad,” she said. “I guess I’ll just have to take a look at all your records for the past few months to see what I can find. You would not believe what some of the guys at Langly can do! Give them some seemingly random pierced of data and they can track down almost anything”

“And it wouldn't hurt to have them take a look at your system. You never know what machines are doing when you think they’re broken!”

Realizing she wasn’t going to give up so easily Shaw have in and decided to throw her a bone. After all, he didn’t have anything to hide... not much to hide at least.

“Listen, I’m closing up in about an hour,” Shaw said. “If you can wait until then I’ll let you take a look at my computer. And in the meantime, you can be the guinea pig for my latest recipe. What do you think?”

Stirling only had to think about it for a second. She hadn’t eaten all day and it would take far longer than an hour to get a warrant allowing her access to what she needed.

She took out a notepad and wrote a few things down as she waited.

Shaw couldn’t stop himself from periodically checking the clock as the second counted down. He wasn’t necessary nevus but he couldn't help but wonder if it would be safer for him to simply slip something into the woman's drink and be done with it. She would die in a day or so and there’d be no way of tracking it back to him.
