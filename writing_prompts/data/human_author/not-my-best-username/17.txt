Case ID: F2RM66-6

Name: Mary Ann, Kelly.

Sex: Female

Age: 21

Occupation: “Manager”

Status: \[Under Investigation by INTERPOL\]

At 09:44 Karen Mc’callister walked into the Mallgreens located at 9002 West Landum st, DC, 20401, and demanded to speak to a manager regarding an incident involving one of the store employees.

At 09:52 the subject walked out of the manager's office and approached Mc’callister who, at the time, was berating one of the staff members.

CCTV footage shows Mary Ann, Kelly receiving a small device from her back pocket which she then appears to use causing a localized temporal anomaly ultimately resulting in a nonlinear deviation of temporal flow.

It is unclear if the device shown in the video caused the temporal event or if it simply controlled a separate device capable of this type of tachyonic interference.

Temporal technicians will have been dispatched. More details we retroactively are added to this report as they develop.

Supplemental:

Localized area \[274.3\] is still being affected by residual temporal energies. Resulting in recurring interpolations and fragmented Laynar planes. Agents should NOT be deployed into infected areas until leakage is sealed.
