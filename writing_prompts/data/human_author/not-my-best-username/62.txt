“Rat! Runt! Mutt!” —The light flashed before I fell back into darkness.

“What are you!? You little half-breed!” I could still hear the insults of the many voices that surrounded my barely conscious body as I lay face down in the dirt.

“Tell us with skin like that, are you closer to man or monster!?” The pain began to reassert itself as my body tried to heal itself.

I spit dirt from between my teeth before curling an arm around my head to protect it from the blows. “Don’t let the mud get in your mouth little hybrid!” A voice mocked,

“Maybe it wants to eat its own kin!” Another voice added.

I just wanted it to be over. I just wanted to stop. But no matter what I didn’t… it never made a difference… I could never change what I am… I couldn’t make it stop… not without… I wanted it all to stop.

The next thing I knew I was on my feet, flames radiating off my arms and chest and purple blood raining down from my temple.

“I’m sorry!” I cried to the crowds of shocked and terrified faces that stared horrified in my direction.

“I didn’t mean to!”—the words stuck in my Throat as more flames burst uncontrolled out of my forearms—“I can’t control it!”

Many of the children in the mob around me were already badly burned from my first outburst. I tried to control it but… it was like a Volcano was erupting in my soul, Those closest to me when I lost control of my powers

I didn’t want to hurt them, I just wanted them to stop hitting me.

“My child, Your abilities are for protecting those who, without them, cannot protect themselves. You must never use your power in anger or as a mere tool to fuel your ambitions. You must learn from my mistakes… Only then will it stop...” his lesson rang loudly in my mind as the town guards dressed in plated armor rushed towards me holding their broad swords over their heads.

“Give up your life you heathen!” a guard shouted, “We will not forgive what you’ve done to our children you beast!”
