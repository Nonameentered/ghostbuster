With a powerful flap, the mighty dragon drove the wind beneath its wings and landed gracefully atop a grassy hill. From this vantage point, the noble beast had a clear view of the rolling hills that gave shape to the meadow. 
  

  
And, if the tales of this land were true, this particular piece of the countryside was just as uninhabited as it was beautiful. An appealing prospect for a creature who so often received unwanted attention.  
  

  
But before the sun had set on that day attention is what the great dragon received.
  

  
Upon hearing of the dragon's arrival the young ruler of a local village, one so small nobody bothered to mention, sent a delegation of his finest knights to meet the dragon and seek its favor.
  

  
He made his men swear they would not return without an agreement from the dragon. So before they left they gather all that legends had told could to appease a dragon.
  

  
With her keen eyesight, the dragon spotted the company of men while they were still easy off. But she tried her best to make it appear like should cloud see them.
  

  
As the men grew closer the dragon raised its head and stood stoically atop hill. Trying its best not to frighten trail of men as they made their way up the hill. 
  

  
The men stop at the foot of the hill and fell to their knees in unison. 
  

  
“Oh, great Dragon! Ruler of the sky and protector of the sun. Please incline your ears to hear my humble words!” one of the men began. His voice was strong but the dragon could hear the fear in his voice. “I am your servant Chadwickian Varfellow, the leader of  the knights of Chacelordawn!”
  

  
The dragon wanted to speak but she didn’t know what to say. Would a simple Hi suffice? Or should she try using one of those hip new phrases the kids are so fond of... How did it go again?
  

  
She was so busy thinking about what to say she didn't hear most of whatever the knight was saying.
  

  
“...and because of this,” the knight continued, “We have brought you gifts of plenty!” —He made a grand gesture as a young woman appeared from the middle of the crowd holding a basket—“See, three-hundred pieces of silver, a bar of pure gold, and the blood of this fine maiden. The most beautiful virgin in all the land!”
  

  
“Please honor us by accepting these gifts as a token of fellowship and our devotion to you o great one! All we ask in return is for mercy. Please spare our lands from your flamming wraith!”
  

  
The great dragon leaned forward to get a better look at what they were offering, causing all the knights to stumble and fall to the ground. 
  

  
“Wraith!?” the dragon bellowed holding in a laugh so as to not broil the men alive, “Who said anything about wraith? Listen guy I appreciate the... housewarming gift and all but... you really didn't have to.”
  

  
“I mean I’m flattered, honored really! If my scales weren’t so thick you could see me blushing right now.”
  

  
The men looked at each other perplexed as the dragon spoke.
  

  
“What is a house warming gift?” one man said to another.
  

  
“Does the dragon plan to burn our village to the ground?” another answered. 
  

  
“How can I say this in a way you’d understand...”—the dragon thought for a moment—“Listen up home slices, this here drago is like your broth’a from another moth’a you dig? I an;t try’n to post up, I just try’in to chillax to the max and vibe out. You feel me little homies?”
  

  
The knights imagining the dragon was casting some sort of spell on them began to cower in fear, praying to their gods and telling their wives in their hearts they loved them. 
  

  
Seeing they fear the dragon tried to make itself smaller by crouching too low to the ground. But the shaking of the ground this caused only made the men more afraid. 
  

  
“Please great dragon, we are no match for you magic!” Varfellow said, standing up to protect his men. “Take away my life but I pray, do not harm the fine people of this land!”
  

  
“Listen Varfellow. Chad was it?” the dragon began, trying her best to make her voice soft and low, “I mean you no harm. Just leave your gift with me and come back later when you’ve all chilled out okay?”
  

  
“We shall obey!” Varfellow responded, “We will bring you more tribute! I swear on my honor that will have more than you desire within a fortnight!”
  

  
With that he rounded his troops a sped off back to the village, leaving the young girl and the basket of riches behind.
  

  
“No, that's not what I meant!” The dragon sighed. “Well.. it could have been worse...”
  

  
A dragon looked down to see the maiden shaking and trembling at the foot of the hill.
  

  
“So... How bout that fortnight... do you like video games too?” the dragon asked looking down at the girl.
  

  
The girl fell to the ground and began to cry. “Please oh dragon, take away my life but please do it quickly! Do not torture me so!”
  

  
“Oh come now!” the dragon replied, her town soft and sweet. “There is no need to cry... did those guys make fun of you back there or something? I’m not great at conflict resolution but I’ll talk I can talk to them when they get back if you like. ”
