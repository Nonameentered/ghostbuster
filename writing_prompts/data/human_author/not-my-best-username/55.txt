I sat perfectly still as the serrated blade rested against my throat. 
  

  
“This actually happens quite a lot," I tell my friend sitting across from me, casually ignoring the knife at my throat. "Well, not with her specifically, but this general situation is quite common for me."
  

  
My friend looked at me with utter shock
  

  
“You know, knives, guns, swords... one of those... spinny stick things...” I said trying to remember what it was called.
  

  
“Nunchucks?” the masked assassin asked quizzically.
  

  
“Nunchucks!? That thing from the WII” I laughed almost forgetting the knife at my throat. “I’m talking about a real weapon! It’s this kinda long stick that breaks in half!”
  

  
“Oh!” the assassin paused, “a bo-staff!”
  

  
“Ding! Ding! Ding! We have a winner!” I said, “I almost had it, it was just on the tip of my tongue!” 
  

  
“Wait for a second!” The assassin said with a note of shock in her voice “Why aren’t you scared of me? What arn’t you begging for your life!”
  

  
“Sorry! Sorry!” I apologized raising my hands into the air, “Jess, this is assassin number 378.” —I gestured to the woman dressed in all black standing behind me—” Assasin 378, this Jess. Jess is a good friend of mine from school and the best darn dancer I know!”
  

  
“But to answer you question... My boss thinks I have a death wish, Mom thinks I’m just unlucky and my therapist thinks it’s the result of some kind of repressed childhood trauma. Something about not getting enough of dads attention...”
  

  
“Personally I think it got boring around the 140 mark. That‘s when you really start to notice the little rotation of weapons and tactics they use. They might have even sent the same assassin a few times. but these things to blend together after a while...”
  

  
The knife dropped to my lap before the confused assassin disappeared outside. 
  

  
“What on earth was that all about!” Jess said leaning over the table “That was nuts!”
  

  
“I know!” I said picking up the knife. “Damascus steel and such intricate carvings on the handle! This one’s a keeper for sure!”
  


“What is wrong with you! are you crazy!” she snapped “somebody just tried to kill you and you’re-”
  

  
“I know, I know!” I interjected. “we promised not to bring up about work stuff. sheesh! You take out one mob boss and suddenly you’re the problem! Anyway... what were we talking about again?”
