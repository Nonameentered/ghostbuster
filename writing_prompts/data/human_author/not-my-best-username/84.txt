“You ever get the feeling you’re forgetting something?” I asked James Cameron my coworker who was standing opposite me beside the water cooler holding a blue disposable cup.

“I mean sure, I guess,” —He shrugged before taking another sip of water— “Like you left the oven or something right?”

“Kinda... but more like,” I rubbed my temple trying to collect my thoughts, “You know what mean, it’s like this gut feeling... like... there's something missing right here”—I tapped my aching belly—“in your stomach.”

“Are you trying to tell me you forgot your lunch again Jerry?” He asked raising an eyebrow. By his face, I could tell he already knew the answer. “You know I’m your friend and I don’t want to be that guy but... You really gotta start writing yourself a note or something man! That like this time this month or something!?”

“You’re right!” —I shook my head feeling a bit embarrassed— “My wife's always reminding me of this stuff but... every time I look into those big blue eyes of hers I... I just get all distracted and flustered you know?”

James reached out and gave me a pat on the firm shoulder— “You’re a lucky guy Jerry!” he said nodding, “your wife does have some BIG blue eyes...”

“...anyway, I should probably tie my PC down before things start shaking. IT wasn't too happy about last time.”

“You’re right!” I agreed, noticing the water in the cooler begin to shake.

A second later I was on the phone with a client.

“Thunder Mephlyn insurance, Jerry speaking,” I said, reaching out to grab a pen and paper, “What's the nature of your claim?”

“...A giant monster just stepped on your apartment is that right?— She’s kinda a cute an’t she?”

“What? Oh nothing... anyway, what’s the address?”

“...Okay, just give me a second to pull up your file...”

As terrified screams filled the air, and the thundering footsteps grew louder I typed the customer's credentials into the system.

“Good news sir!” I said, reading the insurance information that appeared on-screen, “Looks like you’re totally covered for the damage.”

“...No worries I’m just doing my job!”

“You too sir and remember, with Thunder Mephlyn you’re never hung out to dry!”

As soon as I hung up I turned to see my wife crouching over and holding a small baggy through the 15th-story window of the office building.

“Sorry, you had to come all the way down here honey!” I said retrieving my lunch bag from the tip of here warship-sized talons. “You know me, always forgetting things!”

Looking in the bag I was delighted to see some homemade tacos.

I couldn't stop a huge smile from appearing on my face “ Oh babe, What would I do with you!” I an asked

A hurricane-force wind swept the metropolitan street as she blew me a kiss before walking away.

As I watched the cityscape quake and crumble in her wake I was reminded of when we first met... I’ve always hated to see her go. But I LOVE to watch her walk away.

“You were right!” I said looking over at James who was for some reason sheltering under his desk. “I am a lucky man... Maybe the luckiest alive!”
