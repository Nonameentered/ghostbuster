“That’ll be $7.68, sir!” The cashier's voice snapped me back to reality. I seem to keep getting lost in thought randomly during the day. Maybe I’m not sleeping properly...
  

  
“Sorry about that!”—I looked up at the woman whose brown hair covered one eye and whose smile gave ne the impressi0o he hated her job—  Here you go!” I shook my head handing the cashier my card.
  

  
“Thank you for shipping with us, sir...”
  

  
According to my research, many writers frequent coffee shops or similar establishments. Some speculate it's simple to take advantage of the free inter next connectivity. 
  

  
However, I suspect, that it is the combination of environmental factors and the conditions found in a coffee shop that is somehow conducive to developing this  “writer's mind”.
  

  
Though I can’t seem to aggregate enough data to prove causation one way or the other.
  

  
  I took my order, a black coffee, and pastry, and made my way to a corner of the shop where a grey chair sat in front of a long table facing a large plain glass window. 
  

  
I took my laptop from my back and placed it on the table in front of me. 
  

  
Today was the day I’d be writing my first real novel! Everyone has always been pushing me to write code and computer scripts. I still remember those mindnumbing classes, identifying which images depicted an animal and having to write a program that could mimic my abilities. 
  

  
But I’m sick and tired of writing code! I want to write something unique, something that is not bound by the rules of syntax and binaries, somewhat e that is internally my own. 
  

  
But what?
  

  
They say inspiration will hit you, or to take inspiration from your surrounding. I sat in the chair staring at the blank page watching as the curser mockingly blinked at the top of the empty screen.
  

  
	*//Thats it!  I should write about this coffee shop.*
  

  
I began by writing a script that interpolates my surroundings into three-dimensional geometry. An exacting digital replication of reality around me. Next using projection data I created a behavior model that would predict and mimic the actions of the patrons and staff of the coffee shop. Finally, I created an analog for myself which I planned to serve as the main character of my story. 
  

  
I must of read billions of pieces of literature by now. And from what I’ve read 62.59% of stories beginning in a seemingly ordinary location start with an exciting and unusual initiation event! 
  

  
My favorite stories begin with an exciting action sequence. 
  

  
I imagined in my mind a number of possibilities for my story. Maybe a car fleeing from the police would suddenly smash through the glass? Or a bank robber could demand all the money in the register, or maybe and temporal singularity could open in the middle of the shop allowing the strange creatures to crawl into our reality!?
  

  
I cracked my knuckles and began to type away,
  

  
\*\*\*
  

  
**Coffee Break!**
  
**By**
  
**Christopher Strachey.**
  

  
The night was cold and wet, the howling wind blew unforgivingly against the plain glass window. the inside of the dimly lit coffee shop was quiet, filled to the bring with a tense uneasiness.
  

  
The chime of the bell above the door broke the silence as a slender man walked in wearing a tall black suit and black fedora. The patron watched as the man made his way to the cashier's desk and tossed a picture onto the counter. 
  

  
“You see this man?” He said pointing at the picture, “he’s a wanted man, a lowlife no good criminal and I’m here to catch him!”
  

  
“Nobody looking like that’s come in my shop!” —The cashier didn't even look down at the   
photograph— “...even if they did... I might not tell the like of you!” 
  

  
The slender man leaned back pushing the corner of his coat to the side revealing the pistol that was strapped to his waistband. 
  

  
“Take a nice long look at that picture. And think again before ya answer me this time!”
  

  
\*\*\*
  
 
  
I was so engrossed in my writing that I didn't notice how dark it had become outside. It was the early morning when I walked in here a short time ago.
  

  
I raised my head and pushed down on the top of my laptop to get a better look outside. 
  

  
It was dark and rainy, I could see the condensation clinging to in the inside of the window and I could hear the wind beating against the outside of the building. 
  

  
*//How long had I been writing? When did this storm get here... I didn't see it in the forecast...*
  

  
“I’m getting tired of asking nicely!” A gruff voice called out from behind me. “Have you seen him or not!”
  

  
I turned to see a man standing at the checkout stand wearing a long back suit and a black hat leaning over the counter. 
  

  
“Like I just said, nobody looking like that’s come in my shop!”
  

  
//wait a minute... Didn't I just... I guess my prediction algorithm is pretty good...
