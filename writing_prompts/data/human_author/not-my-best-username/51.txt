*The Gate* loomed before the trodden man. Whose aching scarred legs shook as he slalomed through the undulating mire that surrounded the bespoke stone structure. 
  

  
Most who had seen *The Gate* ran away in terror. But for him, the sight of massive stringing was enough to dull the sharp pains he felt throughout his body. He could feel it calling to him. Raised up out of the water like a beacon. set apart from the graveyard of the once proud trees whose hollowed husks had been consumed by fog and stringing mist. Their sacrifice left behind a guiding trail of gnarled monoliths. 
  

  
The man groaned within himself as he lifted a muddied boot out of the water taking a large step out of the mire and onto the large stone platform that surrounded *The Gate.* 
  

  
In response, a great wind blew from the direction of *The Gate* pushing the veil of fog out from before him. 
  

  
The Gate was much larger than it had been described to the man and much more daunting.  Its towering pillars made him feel as small as he did standing beside his father when he was a boy. The intricate carving in the stonework was enough to make a man's head spin. Though he wasn’t focused on them now. 
  

  
He pushed ever forward towards the gate stopping in front of a small cradle-shaped structure that was raised several feet out of the ground in the middle of the path in front of *The Gate.* 
  

  
He reached into his pocket and placed an item wrapped in cloth into the stone basin. 
  

  
A light began to shine from the gate as a man’s voice spoke. 
  

  
“Why do you seek my power?” It asked. 
  

  
“I need to be where he is!” The man cried out his voice hoarse and frail. “Please! Take me there!”
  

  
“Do you know what this will mean? The voice asked, changing from a man’s voice to a women’s. 
  

  
“I have nothing left to lose!” The man pleaded. “Just take me there, please! I beg you! 
  

  
“What will you do if I grant your request? The voice asked, shifting once again. This time it sounded like the voice of a small boy the man recognized. 
  

  
The man flinched and stepped away from *The Gate*
  

  
“I-I don’t know” the man admitted, “Reconcile? Repent? Change my evil ways and start again!? Anything must be better than rotting away in this world! There is nothing left for me here!”
  

  
“What of those in this world who depend on you?” The voice asked. “I depended on you didn’t I” the gate now took the form of the small boy it was imitating. 
  

  
The man fell to his knees collapsing at the boy's feet.
  

  
“I’m sorry!” The man said, tears rolling down his face. “I wasn’t there! I know I broke my promise. Come back to me” 
  

  
He reached out to grab the boy's hand but before their hands met the boys faded back into the fog changing form once again. 
  

  
This time it took the form of a man in his early twenties. Athletic and well-dressed. 
  

  
“You’ve cheated death many times have you not?” The figure asked using the voice of the man’s younger self against him. “Always dancing on the edge but never falling in.”
  

  
Looking around the man suddenly found himself crouching in the sun-soaked grass outside his childhood home. The atmosphere filled with the same happiness and cheer he remembered. 
  

  
“You didn't try and change what happened on that day.” The man shielded his eyes as the horrible event played before him again. “ But now you wish to interfere with the destiny of another. Do you have the strength to step through *The Gate?”*
  

  
“Yes, the man,” said, pushing back to his feet. 
  

  
“Very well.” The voice said as the illusion faded away returning the man to the swamp. “But know this; The Gate will take you not to where you wish to be but where you belong. 
  

  
Blinding flashed tormenting the man's eyes as he stepped with the last of his strength into *The Gate.*
