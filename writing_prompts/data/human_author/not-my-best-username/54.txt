Professor Newmen sat behind his desk like he usually did. Leaning back in his chair with his dark hair combed to one side and a white mug pressed to his lips that he’d occasionally peer over through his glasses to make sure no one was cheating during the test.

Newman's tests are always a wild ride. Not because he’s a bad teacher that gives us tests he never prepared us for like the rest but because his lessons often directly contradicted what was written in the history books.

He’d often say something like, “Lincoln never said anything about an apple tree. I was there that day, and let me just say the fun we were having had nothing to do with apples but boy, were those peaches sweat!”

And then he’d move on as if nothing had happened. But that’s only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to strange in Newman's class.

Remember that mug I mention just a second ago? The one he’s always drinking out of? One time the class clowns Dustin and Hunter were Horsing around when they accidentally knocked the mug off his desk on their way out the door. The mug shattered as most mugs do. But it was so boisterous in the room that no one seemed to notice as Newman picked the broken pieces which seemed to reconstituted themselves back into a mug in his hands!

It was the same mug he was sipping out of right now...

“You’re daydreaming Hughes!” Professor Newman called out to me. No one else seemed to hear it.

I raised a hand apologetically before dropping my head back down and getting back to the test.

**Q: What was the name of the series of programs and projects President Franklin D. Roosevelt enacted during The Great Depression?**

**A.** The Big deal

**B.** The new deal

**C.** Deal with it!

**D.** None of the above.

According to the textbook, the answer is of course B. *The New Deal.* But this was a "Newmen question". I remember what the professor said in a lecture a few weeks ago:

“Frankie D was one a heck of a guy!” He said, clasping his hands together, “funny, charismatic, and smart too! A lot smarter than most gave him credit for! in fact, even a bit of a book worm!”

“I remember talking with Frankie about a couple of programs he was cooking up with his boys at the White House. ‘This will really shake things up!’ He told me, ‘get things going in the right direction!’ The only problem was he couldn’t come up with a snazzy name for It. you know something that would really get the American people behind it!”

“Frankie wanted to call it The Great New Deal or something like that.”—He shook his head at the thought of it— “But I suggested something a lot more unique and a lot more personal for good old Frankie! I suggested we name it after one of his favorite books The Emperor's New Deal was my suggestion!”

“Frankie loved it so much he went with it” Newman concluded, “But over the years people kept shortening it. Calling it  just the New Deal” He rolled his eyes in class Newmen fashion— “That's why so many textbooks get it wrong. Human laziness.”

I circled D. and moved on to the next question.

The rest of the test was more straightforward. I didn’t see any more Newmen questions just some standard American history.

What happened after class was less standard. As always, I was the last to finish the test. Not because I’m dumb just because I like to double-check my answers!

Anyway, As I placed my papers on the stack waiting on his desk, he pushed his glasses out of the way and rubbed his eyes which seemed to glow with a yellow light that narrowly escaped through the cracks in his fingers.

Without uncovering his eyes Professor Newman leaned forward placing both elbows on his desk.

“Get off  here quickly!” He shouted. I’d never heard him raise his voice like this before.

Without raising his head he spoke again, more softly this time. “If you’re not careful, You’ll be late for the bus again! You should really get going!” he reminded me,

“Thanks teach!” I said slinging my backpack over my shoulder. “See you on Monday!”

I pushed through the door and turned to walk down the hallway. But for the rest of the day I couldn't stop thinking about all the oddities I’d noticed over the years around Professor Newman.

*Maybe there was something more to it... Maybe it was time to do some digging...*
