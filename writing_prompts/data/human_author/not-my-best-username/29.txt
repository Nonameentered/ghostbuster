Utter horror gripped her heart as she took in the scene of the murder. Not because it was particularly gory or messy, she’d grown accustomed to blood stains and missing limbs over the years, but because the scene was positively flooded with an ungodly amount of contradictory information and evidence.
  

  
Thousands upon thousands of individual leads that never seemed to quite connect with each other surrounded her as she stood in the center of the room.
  

  
You see the victim wasn’t your run-the-mill housewife we couldn't escape her violent husband or gamble who couldn’t pay his debt. he was a detective and not just an ordinary detective. That would be to simple. 
  

  
He was a temporal detective. A man skilled at solving cases before the crime even 
  
occurred. 
  

  
Evidently, he wasn't skilled enough though. Zanna thought. As she studied the dozens of newspapers that were scattered around the office. Pinned to walls and layout out like tiles on the richly colored oak floor. 
  

  
What was so fascinating about the articles wasn't so much the fact they each came from a different possible future, but how similar and different they were simultaneously.
  

  
“Richard Tracy found dead in Uptown apartment!” one headline read.
  

  
“Famous detective assassinated at Melgrove movie theater. Assailant still at large!” another read
  

  
“Temporal detective couldn’t see the future. The life and untimely death of Richard R, Tracy.” 
  

  
Zanna rubbed her eyes and pushed the newspaper away. How on earth was she going to make sense of all of this?
  

  
How did he manage to get all this information? She wondered tapping her nails on the desk. 
  

  
Just a year ago it was near impossible to get one shred of evidence from a possible future. Now she was sitting in an office brimming with it.  
  

  
But her train of thought was swiftly interrupted by a knock at the door.
  

  
“Yes, what is it?” Zanna called out. 
  

  
The door creaked open and an older gentleman with short white hair poke his head in. 
  

  
“Oh good, you’re still here!” the man said leaning into the room without stepping past the threshold. 
  

  
“Until they fire me like the last three detectives.” Zanna replied. 
  

  
“Four actually” the man corrected, “But that’s not why I’m here. I wanted to see if you needed any refreshments. Coffee or tea? Master Tracy couldn't think straight without a bit of caffeine, especially at this hour!”
  

  
“That’s very kind of you Mr...” Zanna paused realizing she hadn’t asked his name when she first walked in.
  

  
“Bates!” he said filling in the silence.
  

  
“That’s very kind of you Mr. Bates, But I think I should read through the rest of these articles before I took a break.”
  

  
Zanna knew that there had to be something useful written in one of these papers. She just had to find the one that didn’t contradict what she could see with her own eyes. 
  

  
Mr. Bates smiled warmy and shook his head. “Don’t hesitate to call me if you need anything. I’ll be in the study if you need me!”
  

  
As the door clicked shut Zanna’s focus locked back in she couldn’t allow herself to miss a single detail.
