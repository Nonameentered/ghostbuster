“You’ve got to be joking me!” the man said struggling to speak with a cloth gag in his mouth. 
  

  
“I assure you, Mr. Burnham,”  I said methodically  preparing the tolls of my trade, “This experience will be one you won't soon forge-”
  

  
There was a wet thud on the floor as the cloth I'd used to gag him bounced across the floor landing near my feet. 
  

  
“No matter what you do,” I said turning to face the bound man, “You will not esca-”
  
  
  
“I get it, I really do.. you're new to this but—C’mon my dude! 67% chloroform!? Is that really the best you find? I’m not even dazed right now and I just woke up! And—” he swayed from side to side causing it to balance on two legs for a brief moment, “look at all this wiggle room!”
  

  
“A bloated old man could worm out of these! And that assuming these ‘I got booted from of the boy scouts cause I could even learn to tie rope’ knots don't give out first! I mean can you even tie your own shoes!?”
  

  
I tried to speak but the man wouldn’t shut up long enough for me to get a word in edge-wise!
  

  
“And don't even get me started on your little streaming setup you go down here!” He gestured with his head to my cameras. 
  

  
“I mean is this the level we’ve sunk to! REALLY!? These days nobody can do anything without writing a blog about it or posting it on Twitter! And look at you! asking \~chat\~ those pitiful rage-filled parasocial keyboard-warriors, which finger to chop first! Where has all the class gone hmm?”
  

  
“Back in the day, there was so much intrigue! So much mystery! The cat and mouse battle between The Bedside killer and the LRPD. all those cryptic clues Mopcking jay left at his victim's houses before and after the crimes!!”—He sighed— “those were the days!”
  

  
He leaned back in the chair and cracked his neck. “I mean... what are they gonna call you? The Tutorial Terror? Think  about your legacy man!”
  

  
“I’ve heard enough of your insolent chatter!” I demanded stepping forward with my knife in hand. “All shall see my brilliance! Rejoice, your death will be but a  small brushstroke in my masterpiece!”
  

  
“By the time your body is found in the Orlan river, I will have already captured my next victim!”
  

  
“THE ORLAN RIVER!” the man cried out! “Anywhere but THERE, please! That's where Enigma dumped all his victims! People won’t know which serial killer, and I use that term lightly in reference to you, killed me!”
  

  
“Do you have a single original thought in that head of yours!?”—he groaned —“I mean, honestly, at this point, it might not be so bad if people thought Enigma did me in. At least that would get her tally a bit closer to the triple-digit mark...”
  

  
I was beginning to regret my choice in victim. Maybe I should have done a bit more research beforehand.
