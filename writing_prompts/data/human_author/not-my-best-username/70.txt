I don’t know how long I was standing outside, staring up at the gargoyle whose stone face seemed to be drenched with tears as the pouring rain ran down its cheeks, dripping down the sidewalk below. The concrete creature was perched on a ledge on the third floor of the Gotham Charitable Foundation building.

The way it stood thair, looking down at me reminded me of what he looked like as he stood on a rooftop not too different from this one. Come to think of it,  It was raining that night too, but when wasn’t it raining in Gotham?

By the time I had arrived, the voices had already died down. Despite that, I couldn't shake this feeling that the thunder crashing overhead was somehow trying to tell me something, but what?

\-Stop standing there like an idiot? get on with it already!? Or You don’t belong here! get out while you still can!

Either way, there was one tried and true method to decide.

I reached into my jacket pocket and retrieved my old faithful, my lucky coin.

A toss of the coins to decide my fate. I thought,  If it lands heads, I’ll go in. But, if it lands tails I’ll just have to hope lightning doesn't strike twice and I never come face to face with a masked vigilante again.

It is a big city after all.

I flicked the coin off my thumb and watched transfixed as the raindrops danced off the spinning silver dollar.

But before the coin could land back in my hand answering my question, A man in a worn-out red biker jacket came out of nowhere and snatched the coin out of the air!

“What do we have here!?” he asked laughing at me.

I tried to reach out and grab it back but another shorter man in a black leather jacket with alcohol on his breath, placed an open hand on my chest holding me back.

Looking around I counted five men in of them in total, all circling around me and laughing.

“What wrong kid!?” the man who took my coin asked, “Lemme guess, you’re girl dumped you!?”

“Nah! Nah!” another man in the group said, “Look how wide his eyes are, Looks like he’s coming down from a doozy of a trip!”—He grinned widely patting me on the shoulder.

“I didn't know you was a doctor Micky!” The first man joked tossing my coin in the air, “Don’t let it get you down kid, we’ve all been there! And hay, if you’re walking around here I probably know your dealer! He’s a personal friend so I’ll let you get that to him later!” He tossed the coin back to me as he laughed before walking away with his boys down the street.

“And one more thing!” he called out looking back at me, “I got this feeling thins are gonna land heads up!”

I couldn't help but chuckle to myself as the group of men ambled down the way into the dark.

Only in Gotham, I thought, almost forgetting that I needed to check the result of my coin toss.

I looked down and opened my hand... He was right, it landed heads up. I was so shocked by this that I almost didn't realize that my silver dollar had mysteriously turned into a quarter... everything has a price in Gotham.

I took a deep breather before pushing the door open and stepping inside.

The reception area was oddly clean and looked like it had just been renovated, likely due to all the flooding not too long ago.

There were a number of chairs and seats lining the wall sitting beside fake potted plants and posters advertising a “renewed renewal project”.

I followed the long strip of beige carpet that lay over the grey tiled floor and led to a small desk at the end of the room.

Behind the desk sat an older lady with short dark brown hair and red-framed reading glasses.

The woman didn’t seem to notice as I walked toward her shaking the rain from my jacket.

"Excuse me miss?" I said, trying to speak quietly enough not to scare her.

She looked up at me without saying a word.

"I.. I don't know things work over here, but... about a week ago... well.. a man dressed as a bat told me to come here. He said you have work for people like me, people who wanted to— need to mend their ways... so here I am"

“Blast it!” she swore under her breath,

“Sorry... Am I in the wrong place?” I asked

“No, No, you’re in the right place kid...” She said, “it’s just... I’ve been working here for over six months and I haven't had to do any work! Can you believe it!? It’s a dream come true! All I have to do is sit in this lobby for a few hours, doing whatever I want,  and collect my paycheck!”

“And if you’d show up a few weeks later I woulda won my bet too! Anyway, enough about me, what’s you’re name kid?”

“My names?” I asked.

“What do kids these days not have names and more!? Lemme guess you go by Condiment King or Puzzle Master or something!?” she said.

“The names Wayne.” I said,  “Wayne Wright,”
