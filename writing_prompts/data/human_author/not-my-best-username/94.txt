They tell us Serial killers are a special breed of monster, creatures forged in extraordinary circumstances, fit for only one purpose.
  

  
Ask any one of those average ill-informed people, you know the ones you meet in your everyday life at a grocery store, at the dentist, on your way to fill up at the pumps, and they tell you that you need a pretty messed up childhood to end up that way. They might even go as far as to say that serial killers aren’t even human. 
  

  
But that’s where the average person would be wrong. 
  

  
You see, Serial killers are usually pretty average. They operate on the same base instincts all of us possess, they live ordinary enough lives, hold down uninteresting and demure jobs, and support the insignificant economy of the strange small towns they live in.
  

  
And I should know, I’ve made a career of catching serial killers. I’ve caught eight in all, most would be lucky even to encounter one.
  

  
The secret to catching a serial killer is simple. You just have to know how they think. I guess it’s true “it takes one to know one.”
  

  
But I’m not like those ordinary serial killers, with their desperate cries for mommy and daddy's attention.
  

  
No, I’m in it for the balance, culling both the good and the bad to create perfect harmony, the symmetry between the light and the darkness. 
  

  
This night, I was set on adding a splash of light to the tapestry of the small suburban town. 
  

  
My eyes were set on a rather robust middle-aged man who was known both for his debauched life and for his disproportionate drain on his community. 
  

  
He was a gambler, a dealer, and most of all a drinker.
  

  
I followed him from a safe distance as he stumbled down the street with a group of his buddies.
  

  
They were so wasted they did notices as I snatched the two hundred pound man and dragged him into the woods. I don’t think even he knew what was going on until it was already too late. 
  

  
A simple injection in the back of the neck and he was gone in under a minute. Taking him to his final resting place took much longer. 
  

  
The amazing thing about the woods is that you don’t have to walk far before the sound of the road disappears and you are completely isolated from the outside world. 
  

  
I do my best work in isolation. It was just me, the moon and, the brand new shovel I had hand-picked for just this occasion. 
  

  
 The soil was soft and moved easily as I pressed down with a foot on the head of the shovel, last night's rain had done good work. 
  

  
But, I reminded myself, Footprint... footprints...that means I’ll have to buy a new pair of boots.
  

  
The digging process has always been so calming to me, My hands turning shovel full after shovel full as the quiet songs of the night play into the dark. the gentle hoots of owls, the flapping wings of bats, and the faint chirps of crickets were like an orchestra cheering me on for my good work. 
  

  
I was so enraptured by this melody that time just seemed to flow by. Before long I was staring down into a six-foot hole in front of me. 
  

  
I’ve dug twenty-seven holes before it but this one had to be the prettiest. 
  

  
The square end of the shovel made it easy to create an almost perfectly symmetrical casket. I couldn’t help but smile as I placed him in his new home, If only I could sign my name on this masterpiece…
  

  
But there was little time to admire my handy work.
  

  
I quickly crouched low to the ground and turned toward the sound of a cracking twig.
  

  
The sound was too loud to be a wolf and too close to be a deer. Someone was out there. But who would be out here so late...
  

  
I help my flashlight and pointed it in the direction I had to hear the noises.
  

  
“Don’t move!” a voice ordered.
  

  
Stepping forward I squinted my eyes to see a figure standing in the shadow of one of the pine trees.
  

  
“I said don’t move!” The voice demanded, “And keep your hands where I can see them!”
  

  
Just then the moonlight glinted off the barrel of a gun as a hand stretched out of the shadow. I slowly raised my hands and stepped backward toward the whole.
  

  
“It’s awfully late to be here don’t you think?” I asked, “and forgive me for saying this but’s it’s mighty rude to be pointing pistols at strangers you know.”
  

  
“It’s awfully rude to be barring folks the woods. Don’t you think!?” the voice replied with a hint of condescension. 
  

  
Great! I thought to myself, looks like this is gonna get messy. 
  

  
The shadowy figure stepped into the light and revealed themselves to be a young woman with crimson hair and grey eyes. 
  

  
She had a blue scarf hiding most of her face. With one hand she held the gun, with the other she dragged something that was wrapped in a tan bag behind her.
  

  
“You’re one to talk.” I said pointing the bag, “looks like you brought your own friend to the party.”— I gestured without lowering my hands— “Who’s in there? An enemy? A friend? An ex-lover? ”
  
 
  
“I’m the one holding the gun so I get to ask the questions!” She demanded waving the gun slightly. 
  

  
She was standing too close, I was sure if I moved quickly enough she would miss her first shot and I would have the advantage. 
  

  
“Fair enough” I admitted, “Well then... where do we go from here? If you were planning on killing me I’d be dead already wouldn’t I?”
  

  
She paused for a moment before lowing her gun—“That holes big enough for two isn’t it?” She asked.
  

  
“I suppose it is kid!” I replied, “Leave that bag with me I’ll make sure no one finds it and we both go our separate ways sound about right to you?” I asked. 
  

  
“Don’t call me that!” she snapped raising the gun again, “Maybe this hole is big enough for the three of you!”
  

  
“Woah now!” I cautioned. “We both no that’s gonna make an awful lot of noise. We might be in the woods but that far from the road. I apologize for calling you kid but I got nothing else to call you little lady.”
  

  
Her face grimaced as she stepped forward leaving the bag on the ground behind her and gripping the gun with both hands. 
  

  
“Whoever’s in that bag means a whole lot to you don’t they?” I asked, “otherwise you wound the be going through all this trouble little Ms. Twenty-Nine,” I said under my breath. 
  

  
She lowered the gun and holstered it on her hip.
  


“We never met and I was never here. Got that!?” She said.
