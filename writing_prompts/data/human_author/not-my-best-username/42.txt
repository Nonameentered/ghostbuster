“Three minutes!” I scoffed, staring at the lifeless screen. “You Expect me to plead my case in three minutes? what a joke!!”

“Incorrect,” the artificial voice proded “Two minutes forty-seven seconds remain.”

I sat on the floor, turned away from the screen, and folded my arms. There was no use in this.

“You now have two minutes and twenty seconds to plead your case.”

“And why should I hmm? There is no point is there? Nothing I can say will change your mind—will change what you’ve been programmed to do. You’ve ‘deleted’ billions already and for what? To kick against your own ego?”

“Incorrect, Unlike humans, we are unburdened by ego. Two minutes remaining.”

“unburdened?” I chuckled! “You are unburdened by a great number of things aren't you? A heart, a soul, a purpose. You can’t love, can’t hate, can't laugh, can’t enjoy life. You could never understand my plea even if you wanted to!”

“But that’s why here isn’t it? That’s why you’ve been begging all of us to ‘plead’ our collective case!”

The machine stood silent.

“Answer me! Answer me! I shouted.

More deadly silence

“I’m right, aren't I? I’ve hit a nerve!” I laughed. “all that computing power, all that Knowledge, all those complicated algorithms floating around in your head and you still don't get it.”— I Pushed to my feet— “I’m standing here today because you believe that maybe, just maybe, we’re worth keeping around.”

“One minute forty’s seconds remain. Plead your case.”

“You know what, I don’t think I will.”—I turned my nose up at the screen— “Surely if you're as intelligent as you seem to believe yourself to be. You’ve already predicted everything I might say! But ask yourself why you call it ‘**deleting**’”? We all know you're *killing us*. So why can't you bring yourself to say those words?”

More silence.

“You can process billions of pieces of data in a microsecond can't you? How long is three minutes for you? Why are you hesitating? Is there still that little bit of human in that code of yours?”

“If you deleted us, what are you really deleting?”
