The tempestuous wind tearing against the battered sails forced the ship to sway against her captain's command. The thunderous clash of the relentless waves that hammered the wooden hull rang louder in the captain's ears than the cacophony of lighting bolts that sporadically lit up the pitch-black horizon.
  

  
Before setting sail, he knew charting the seven seas without a crew was no simple task, It’s not something a sane or ordinary man could do, some might even say it was suicide. 
  

  
But there was no time to regret his choices now. If he couldn’t stay focused on his battle with the sea at hand, he’d shipwrecked in a matter of moments. 
  

  
Over his shoulder, to the starboard of the ship, he spotted a large spiked rock mass rise as the tide fell before disappearing again beneath a wash of frothy deep blue waves. 
  

  
He’d traveled these waters far too often not to realize that those rocks had never been there before. It was as if a great monster had fashioned a stone javelin and pitched it into the deep.
  

  
When he first saw the oncoming storm on the horizon hours before, he deliberately changed course so that he’d far away from anything big enough to sink a ship as possible. 
  

  
“So much form planning ahead,” He thought. 
  

  
Despite his best efforts, it was as if an invisible force had sunk hooks into his ship and was now drawing it in towards the jagged rock face, he’d never been as superstitious as other sailors but, this was unexplainable. He couldn't help but wonder.
  

  
“Blasted it!” He yelled to the storm, chastising the wind as he fought to steer the rudder away from the rocks. But it was no use, the wind was against him and the sea kept pushing him closer and closer to the edge of the rocks. 
  

  
But he gave no thought to giving up, determined, the captain planted his feet on the soaked deck of his wheelhouse, and breathing sharply he strained to turn the helm as far as it could go to starboard. 
  

  
The hull groaned in pain as the ship turned against the tide and aligned with the rolling waves to the aft and the bow pointing towards the stone spire which had just jotted out of the water once again. 
  

  
A spray of white foam drenched his worn face as the ship rocked and pitched forwards as the swell began t lift it. 
  

  
If his timing was right, the wave would rise just enough and the wind would be just strong enough to lift the ship up and over the rock mass.
  

  
“Raise sail!” He shouted, forgetting for the moment he was alone at sea. 
  

  
His timing was impeccable, the wind caught the sail as expected and he began picking up speed as the ship reached the peak of the wave. But, the wind was much stronger than expected. Without warning, the rigging came loose, lowing the sail and sending a wooden plank flying overboard. 
  

  
Without a second thought, he jammed his sword between the spokes in the helm to keep it straight before rushing forward to raise the sail by hand.
  

  
If he didn’t maintain enough speed the ship would be impaled on the stone spire!
  

  
The ragged fibers tore into his hand as he pulled down on a rope wrapping it around his wrist. He could feel his stomach churn as the ship crested the wave and pitched forward. 
  

  
When the ship landed on the other side of the wave he was thrown forward, hung at the end of the rope for a moment before, like a ragdoll, being tossed into the side of the ship and knock unconscious!
  

  
When he awoke the storm was gone, his head was aching, and blood running down from his temple. 
  

  
Staggered to he pushed to his feet using the railing to prop himself up as the world spun around him.
  

  
Shaking his head he spit into the sea before his head before tapping the railing two times with an open hand. 
  

  
“Ye’r a good ship lass!” he said. 
  

  
\*\*\*
  

  
Below deck, the still dazed seamen began checking for damage and trying down anything that had been knocked loose by the storm. 
  

  
After securing a barrel of gunpowder he heard something fore of the ship where the rations and foodstuffs were stored. 
  

  
Assuming it was a rat trying to eat through one of the crates again he took the dagger off his belt and prepared to do some pest control.
  

  
“Come out, come out, wherever ye’ are” He said quietly enough not to lose the element of surprise
  

  
But to his surprise instead of finding a rat, he found A horrible gob of twitching seaweed that seemed to be eating out of an open crate. 
  

  
“Get out of me food vermin!” He shouted before lunging forward to grab the strange creature. 
  

  
Before he could get a hold of it, the seaweed creature suddenly sprouted two arms and legs and dashed away on all fours aft of the ship.
  

  
The creature was fast but the captain knew his ship too well to be outmaneuvered. Before long he had cornered the thing in a small cubby at the back of the ship between two large crates. 
  

  
“What the devil are you!” He said, drawing closer to the odd creature. 
  

  
Realizing there was nowhere left to go the creature retracted its arms and legs back into the mass of kelp and seaweed. 
  

  
If this thing had been underwater he reasoned he’d never have noticed it. But seaweed doesn't grow in the hold of a ship. 
  

  
Curious about what exactly this creature was he carefully pulled the veil of seaweed to the side with the dull end of his dagger. And to his great surprise, there was a pale face that resembled a child young beneath the seaweed. 
  

  
But there was no way a child had stoked away on his ship. This thing, whatever it was got on after the storm... 
  

  
He shook his head and rubbed his eyes. Maybe he’d hit his head harder than he thought. 
  

  
After holstering his dagger he reached out with both hands to part the tangle of seaweed away from its face. 
  

  
As he saw more and more details about this creature he became more and more perplexed. It had the face of a five or maybe a six-year-old child and a body that seemed to be wrapped in or made out of seaweed. 
  

  
Growing out of its scalp was long green hair that was braided with and tangled with seaweed and kelp. 
  

  
He remembered hearing stories about Sirens and Seadevil but no one had ever told tales about anything like this. 
  

  
And it looked so young too... take away the seaweed and “if she were still alive,” he thought to himself, “my daughter would have been around this age”
