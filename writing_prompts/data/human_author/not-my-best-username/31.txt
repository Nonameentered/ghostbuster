As the small testicles released their grip from the back of the young hero's kneck he stumbled and fell to one knee nearly pushing his new attendant over. 
  

  
“My lord, are you alright!?” The attendant asked furrowing his brown under his long moppy hair. “Are you injured, young master?”
  

  
“My head!” the young man cried out gripping his aching scalp, “Who are you? Where am I... What did you do to me!?”
  

  
“It is I, Marcus, your humble attendant!” Marcus said, before kneeling beside the still dazed boy as he curled into a ball in the corner. “Do not worry master Luke, I will call a healer for you!” 
  

  
Marcus leaped to his feet and pocked his head outside of the tent “Healer! I need a Healer at once!” he shouted. Alerting both the camp guards and the healers that something was wrong. 
  

  
All the resulting shouting and panic were the perfect distraction for the small octopus-like creature to crawl its way out of the camp and into the nearby woods. 
  

  
“Whew!” the creature said to itself, “That was a hard week's work! Who would have thought it takes that long to kill a dragon? I should pick a strong host next time!” 
  

  
Taking control of a small lizard the creature made its way strangely through the thick woods and arrived at a small cabin hidden in the thicket. Then after realizing the mind of the lizard it crawled through an open wind landing on a counter beside an old cooking pot.
  

  
“You’ve been out late.” A gruff old voice said. 
  

  
The creature lifted itself with its tentacles to look up at the scruffy man who peered back at him incredulously. 
  

  
“Dad!” the creature said holding up two tentacles like a child asking to be picked up, “Did you see what I did? I killed a dragon, a whole hoard of monsters!”
  

  
“Did I do good? Are you proud of me!? Is Larvo still your favorite!?” Larvo asked
  

  
The huge muscle-bound man looked down at the oddly adorable creature trying his best to maintain his usual stoic expression.
  

  
“Do good!?” the man asked sternly. “You mind controlled that boy for over two weeks! How many times have I told you not to control things that can make decisions for themselves?” He shook his head and waved a finger in front of the Larvos pudgy face. 
  

  
As the man continued his lecture on the ethics of mind control Larvo slowly lowered his outstretched tentacles and made himself small. 
  

  
Larvo looked immeasurably sad, like a puppy after being told off for making a mess in the house. 
  

  
Seeing he had made his point the man's expression softened and he leaned in closer. 
  

  
“Other than that,” the man said, “You did better than good, you did great!”
  

  
If a Polymy could smile Larvo was beaming. The man could feel Larvo’s joy radiated through their psychic connection as they continued to speak telepathically. 
  

  
Not that he needed that to see Larvos happiness. His little tentacles couldn’t help but danced around as the man lifted him with one hand and placed him on his own shoulder.
  

  
“Do you mean it?” Larvo asked, “Are you really really proud of me dad?”
  

  
“I mean it kid!” He said as he went back to working on his equipment. “If it wasn’t for you that village would be in smolders. I’m not sure even I could have done a better job!”
  

  
Larvo wrapped his tentacles around the man's shoulder and gave him a squeeze.
  

  
“But don’t forget why we’re here” the man cautions his voice returning to its cold and calculated self. “A few more weeks and we’ll have more then a dragon to worry about.” 
  

  
“And one more thing,” the man added, “Stop calling me dad... it makes me feel old...”
  

  
“Whatever you say, dad!” Larvo said.
