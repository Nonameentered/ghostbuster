I lay paralyzed in my bed, unable to do anything other than stare back into the eyes of the murky figure that loomed over me.

Another night, another sleep paralysis demon... I thought wishing I could go back to sleep.

    “Naw... it’s the same one... just me... again... ‘demon's kinda harsh...”

“Oh, my bad! sorry man. Didn't mean to be offensive or anything... I know mane callings not cool.” I said in mind.

“It’s whatever... everybody does it. ‘Paralysis demon’, ‘sleep demon’,  ‘night terror’                            -           demon this demon that... but I’m not a demon, I’m just a dude. I got a name, it’s              -           Doug! Is it  too much to ask to be called by my own name? The name my momma gave -            me!?”

“Like I don’t go around calling you people ‘Sleeper demons’ or ‘nocturnal nightmares’     -            I’m just out here grinding, doing my job!”

“I feel you, Doug...” I replied in thought,  “you’re like the only one who ever comes to visit me and I was kinda rude back there.”

    “I appreciate that man... wait a second... How did you? Are you talking to me!?”

“Yeah? I guess!” I replied, “I was kinda having a prevent thought and you replied to it so... I guess I was thinking out loud!”

“Yeah people do that all the time without noticing it!”—he laughed—” aren't you scared   -          of me or something? People usually take one look at me and freak out then wake up in -           a panic or something...”

“I mean... you unique looking but not really scary if that's okay for me to say... I play horror games on a daily and you don’t even compare to some of the crazy stuff in those”

“Yeah, that explains a lot, my guy. Some of the stuff in your dreams are wild! Like that  -            centipede with the literal baby face, not that hawk chick with the scissor hand things... -            You should probably lay off those if you want to actually feel rested after going to          -             sleep you know...”

“Anyway... I gotta go and you’ll probably forget all this so...”

“Woah Woah wait!” I said in my mind, “You're going on to your next dream or whatever ever right?”

“Yeah...”

“Can I come with you!? I mean, is pandemic times dude. I haven't been anywhere interesting in like a decade bro!”

\-“Let me get this straight. You want to go with the paralysis demon you just met to                 -                     go mess around in other people's heads!?”

“First of all, we don’t use the ‘D word’ anymore. If I don't get to use it you should be canceled for using it on yourself! Second, absolutely! yes! Sign me up! I know we’ve only known each other for like 12 seconds but... C’mon, you feel it too! We’re already bros. Don’t try and deny it!”

If whatever kind of dream creature Doug is could blush he was definitely blushing!

“Alright! You’ve been pretty cool so you can tag along. But, this is a one-time thing! And my boss can never know about it! Deal?”

“Deal!” I agreed
