Borrowed time.

Straxus was in a worse mood than usual. Not only had he recently been demoted to Chief Technical Officer of temporal acquisitions but more annoyingly  the Celestial Intervention Agency was breathing down his neck again. Asking questions and poking their noses why they ddint belong. He stood in front of the view screen with his eyes closed as he typed on the holographic keyboard entering the necessary temporal or geological locational data into the machine.

“Which century are they sending us to this time?” Dr. Martha Bellome asked standing beside him watching him work.

Unlike Straxus, Dr. Martha Bellome liked her job. She found the work rewarding and she viewed each and every obstacle she faced as a fun puzzle to solve! She graduated top of her class in 2006 which although technically speaking was thousands of years ago was only three years ago from hwe perspective.

“Figure it out for yourself!” Straxus jabbed enlarging the screen so that she could see it. “it’s the only way you’ll ever learn.”

The screen displayed a long string of seemingly random of characters and symbols that changing every other second.

“225.679” Dr. Bellome readout. “Earth, United Kingdoms,1916?” She slowly translated the coordinate data before turning to Straxus for approval.

Straxus shook his head in frustration. “You’re 66% correct. I believe  that's a failing grade even by your standards. You got the planet and time right sure, but your knowledge of earth history is severely lacking. 1916 is years after the Americas gained independence and well before the reunification!“

Dr. Bellome nodded in agreement. “Humans are a fascinating species arn’t they. But it’s hard to keep track of all their politics.”

“Let’s get on with it,” Straxus urged, “I don’t want to be here longer than we have to.  Make yourself useful and read out the display while I tune the instruments.”

“Of course!” Dr. Bellome said stepping up to the viewscreen. “We're looking for a Walter Sutton. physician and geneticist. Born 1877.” she cringed as she read the next few lines. “Died of acute appendicitis, age 39. What a way to go!”

“I really don’t see how someone who died of appendicitis in some backwater epoch can help us with a modern problem!” Straxus moaned.

“You Never do. That's why they assigned me to be your assistant!” Dr. Bellome said, ” You’d just be alone in here brooding and belly aching otherwise.”

“Alright, alright! Thats enough,” Straxus said checking his calculations one last time. “let’s begin extraction!”

“Right away!” Dr. Bellome said as the machine roared to like. “Temporal engine spooling up. Artifacts low, wavelengths nominal!”

“Very good!” Straxus said, “ initiating tachyonic spore injection into time stream. Stand by for confirmation”

Dr. Bellome struggled to keep up with the flood of information scrolled across the screen. “All lights green so far! Tether is almost in place... We have a connection!”

“Very good doctor!” Straxus said please by his own work. “If the fish is hooked let's reel him in!”

Dr. Bellome entered a few more values before pulling down on a large lever. “Deploying temporal scoop in Three—Two—One!”

There was a huge cacophony of noise as matter began to stream through the temporal tunnel. Slowly but surely a man laying on a bead began to materials in the observation room. When the process was done the machine powered off.

“Looks like another job done!” Dr. Bellome cheered.

“Only if we can keep him alive!” Straxus noted.
