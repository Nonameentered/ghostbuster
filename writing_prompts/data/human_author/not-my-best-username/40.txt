I walked through the door with a pounding in my chest. I hadn’t been to a doctor's office since the incident in 09. I didn’t have the heart to… or the medical insurance.   
   
I made my way through the waiting room pacing by a handful of patrons sitting in plastic chairs waiting to be seen by the good doctor before finall reaching the reception desk.   
I leaned on the marble countertop and smiled at the dark haired receptionist sitting behind the computer. She peered up at me peek her eyes just above glasses and breaking away from her game of scrabble just long enough to acknowledge my existence.   


“Have an appointment?” She said, with a monitored voice.   


“Not really…” I said nervously, “I was hoping Dr. Jones had an opening today!”  


She paused for a moment enraptured by the games she was playing in her Computer. After a few sounds the spell was broken and she spoke again.   
“Dr. Jones retired three years ago.” She pointed out, “Dr. Roswell as taken over his practice. I can make you an appoint if you’d like.”  


I guess it was only a matter of time before the old kook pack it in. But he was the only doctor I really trusted. Despite how bad I was feeling I was in no hurry to try out a new doctor.  


“What he like?” I asked. “ this doctor Rosewell?”  


“Huh!?” She said, looking away for, the screen for a second. “Oh. He pretty alright. No one seems to complain and he pays well…”  


A second later a giant uptight tentacle monster burst through the door with a chart clapped in its grasp.   


I flinchEd back almost through myself to the ground. “What on earth is that!?” I screamed.   


“That’s the doctor…” the reception said as she glared at me.   


“Doctor!?” I said. “That’s not even human!”  


“Now now sir. Racism is not permitted on this property!” She pointed with a finger to a “No Smoking” poster on the wall.   


“That says no smoking you idiot!” I yelled.  


“Not that!” She pointed again. This time to “no racism” sign that was posted right next to the “No Smoking” sign.   


“It’s 2024 sir!” She remarked “this type of bigotry will not be tolerated.”  


“Now Jenny!” The tentacle monster interjected with a booming voice. “If you treat all my patient this way I’ll be out of business!”  


The creature carried itself on its tendrils and approached me extending a long arm like appendage in my direction. “Sorry about that. She can be a bit grumpy before her morning coffee!”  


I took the tip of the tendril in my hand and shook it like a hand. Nobody around me seemed to notice how strange this all was!

”James Roswell!” He said. “now take me to your leader!”
