The representative stood just on the other side of the reinforced glass, her long dark evening coat draped to the sides of her slender figure that was just as plain as the way she spoke.

"The League of SuperHeroes can't help but notice,"—she

Said before readjusting her glasses—"that certain corporations have a say in which supers the government determines are heroes and which are villains. A large say. The League has determined this is not an acceptable arrangement any longer."

“And pray tell, what does this have to do with me?” He didn’t bother to stand from his velvet tufted chair. Instead, he sat back and continued to read his book pausing only long enough to respond.

“I have been a thorn in the side of those ‘corporations’ for some time now. Argus, Line Corp, Heroshema, and I have an extensive history.”—He couldn't help but wonder what was going on— “What do they want with me now? Another victory lap? Or perhaps a photo op to raise more funds?”

There was a tap on the glass followed by A loud electric buzz as the motorized door slid open. He almost rose from his seat out of instinct but managed to resist the urge.

“You're free to go.” She said plainly.

“Free to go?” he asked, his voice raised slightly, “Ten years of being hunted like a dog, two years of hiding! and you're letting me go after just six months in prison?” He was beginning to enjoy the quiet change of pace of running his operation from the shadows.

“Oh well,” He placed his book on his lap and crossed his legs. She had his full attention “Halloween is a way off my dear, it’s quite improper to be playing tricks this early in the month.”

“There is no trick, I assure you,” she said before stepping through the doorway,”—She glanced around the room, taking in the refind furniture that seemed to belong more in a library or psychologist's office than a prison cell.

“We’ve reviewed your file and nothing you’ve done raises to the level of villainy...

While your tactics may be -- unethical, You’ve caused no casualties and you’ve never caused more than 10.000 dollars worth of damages to public or city property. A better record than many of the ‘heroes’ that are free to roam the streets.”

“If you’re going to lie to me, do try and be more convincing.” He wagged a finger, “If setting me free was the true goal of the League they would have done it without sending a representative to me. Especially one so poorly disguised.”

The woman's face began to contort as her skin changed from an olive tone to a light blue.

“I suppose nothing much get’s past you does it?” She asked now using her normal voice.

“I’ve studied every member of the League just as much as they’ve studied me.” He explained, “I recognized that face, You used it once before, haven't you? Five years ago when you infiltrated The Syndicates network.” —he rose from his seat and looked her in the eye—“Now tell me, what are you really here for?”

Instead of answering his question verbally, she gently reached out and connected their two minds.
