“Oh my goodness you’re so cute!” an older lady dressed in all white said looking down at a little girl who must have been five or six years old. . “I could just gobble you right up!”
  

  
The little girl looked up to her mother before smiling widely her cheeks flushing a bright pink. She knew she was cute but not everybody had to remind her.
  

  
“What’s your name sweety?” the woman asked kneeling down to her eye level. “You look just like my grandbaby did when she was your age!”
  

  
The little girl stepped back slightly partially tucking herself behind her mother's leg. 
  

  
“It’s okay.” the girl's mother said waiting for her to speak. “Sorry about that. Her name’s Lucy!” she explained breaking the silence
  

  
“Lucy!” the older woman said with a gleam in her eyes. “What a wonderful name! I always wanted to name one of my daughters Lucy... Such plump little cheeks you have! And such precision hair! Your eyes are to die for!”—She gasped— “you know people would pay a lot of money to be as cute as you young lady!—She winked and smiled widely—” I wish I could just pick you up and take you home with me for dinner.”
  

  
The girl's mom didn't seem to notice the older woman look left and right before whispering something into the girl's ear and suddenly standing up. 
  

  
“Well.”—The woman feigned a glance at her watch— “It’s about time I got home and started preparing dinner!. But it was so good to finally meet you and I’m sure we’ll be seeing each other very, very soon!”
  

  
The girl's mother gave a warm smile and a wave “Lucy, What do we say before we leave?”
  

  
“Nice... Nice to meet you” the girl said in a soft voice. 
  

  
As the mother and daughter continued on their way the lady dressed in white watched them disappear into the crowd.
