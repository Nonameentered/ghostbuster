“The rest of your people!?” Norman gasped.
  

  
He was unsure of how to feel about what he had just learned. In fact, he was unsure if he even believed it. 
  

  
Since he was a boy Norman had always wondered if there was life beyond his small town filled with such similar people. He used to imagine that his stuffed bears and lions in his bedroom had lives and adventures of their own while he was away at school or tending to his chores. 
  

  
A thought his mother quickly and through rooted from his young, imaginative mind.
  

  
Norman crouched to the ground and contemplated for a moment before reaching out a hand toward the creature.
  

  
“Surely we could get there much faster if I were to carry you wouldn’t we?” Norman asked.
  

  
Before Gilafogala Had a chance to speak the boy quickly spoke again 
  

  
“I-I don’t mean to be rude but, you see, it might be hard for me to see you let alone follow you as you scamper through this thick and tall grass.” 
  

  
“You practically blend in! So I just thought that since you can talk and all, you could just tell me which way to go” Norman said quickly without stopping to take a breath. 
  

  
Gilafogala raised a foreleg over his head. “You did a fine job when you picked me up the first time,” it said. “And I suppose it would be a good test of the progress of my linguistic skill thus far in my studies!”
  

  
“Very well young man, you may pick me up!”—The creature stepped toward the Norman—“w, Lower your hand and keep still while I climb into your palm”
  

  
Norman couldn’t stop his hand from shaking with excitement as Gilafogala climbed into his hand. 
  

  
“Where too?” Norman asked.
