—Sardines. We were all packed together in that cold, cramped waiting area like sardines in a thin tin can. That’s what it felt like at least... Sitting there as often as I did. Waiting there in that long dimly lit corridor surrounded by strangers and anxious with nothing but my own thoughts to ease the passage of time as the hours slipped quietly into oblivion. 
  

  
No matter how many times I’ve visited this place it’s never gotten any easier. I wanted to be a Medtech when I was younger but this ‘hospital’ was built far more like a factory than a place of healing. 
  

  
Rows of identical thinly cushioned metal chairs streamed endlessly down that narrow corridor that itself seemed to go on forever.
  

  
Vibrant flashes of color and light created a kind of tunnel of light as a result of the Holoscreens and projects that covered nearly every inch of every wall and bathed the room in a wash of light. 
  

  
Each screen advertised something different. One ad showed an image of a blonde woman holding a Vibro-Brush something about nanobot toothpaste, another displayed live footage of a luxury cruise, still, another offered the experience of a lifetime! A pill that made dreams come true. 
  

  
But the ad that caught my eye was for an Ellrillian coffin. “Let you’re loved ones rest in peace for only 3.000 credits a month!” it read. 
  

  
I couldn't even afford to die...
  

  
I instinctively stood as the loud hiss of the hermetically sealed door filled the space.
  

  
Beyond the door stood a middle age woman, not one I’d seen before, shrouded in a clod of disinfectant mist and dressed in a white protective suit that covered every inch of her body.  She waited for the door to fully open before finally stepping out into the hallway.
  

  
“How bad is it?” I asked, expecting to receive the same canned answer as always: no better, no worse. Come back in another three days. 
  

  
“He’s dying. He’ll be dead very soon.” she peered over her spectacles to gauge my reaction but didn't give me enough time to say anything. “I suggest you get your affairs in order... now, please sign here.” 
  

  
She held out a tablet as if this were routine. As if she hadn’t just told me that the only person I’ve ever cared about was about to die.
  

  
I looked down at it and instantly recognized the tablet as a payment form.
  

  
“H-He’s Dying!” I said, “Isn't there anything you can do!?”
  

  
She shook her head and reached out to bring the tablet closer to me.
  

  
“I’m sorry. We’ve done all we can with your current standing. Unfortunately, we cannot fulfill your request, due to your insufficient social credits. Please sign here.”
  

  
“But... That can’t be right!” I said raising my voice “We haven’t done anything wrong! We’re good people! There has to be some mistake!”
  

  
A subtle pip echoed through the PA system notifying everyone in earshot that the security detail was now monitoring the situation. I knew I had to choose my next words carefully. 
  

  
“Are you questioning me?” she asked, her tone growing even colder than it already was.
  

  
“Of course not!” I stammered, my mind racing to find an acceptable response, one that wouldn't trigger a censor. “That would be wrong. That would be a crime!” I said.
  

  
“And why is that?” she asked posing a question like a teacher quizzing a student.
  

  
“Because questions breed questions,” I said, repeating the mantra I’d known since I was just a little girl. 
  

  
“Very good. That’s correct”—she tilted her head and stood resolute—“Questions breed questions. Questions lead to answers. Answers lead to dissatisfaction. Your state loves you. Your state wants you to be happy. Don’t you want to be happy?”
  

  
“Yes, of course, everyone does.”
  

  
“Good, then please sign here.”
