Do your job long enough and they’ll eventually replace you with a machine. That’s been the unofficial mantra of the working class for years now. A news report published a few months back highlighted the strange fact that 78.9% of Human Resources workers have been replaced by third-gen, State-of-the-art, privately-owned artificial intelligence. 
  

  
Commonly known by the public as ‘AI3’s’
  

  
The first corporation to replace its Human Resources workers with AI3’s was Rexcorp, the brainchild of trust fund billionaire James Matthey, Rexxon. 
  

  
The reason for his sudden departure from human-focused employment was simple he said.
  

  

  
“Workers at Rexcorp are entitled to personalized care at all times, not just when someone is available to care for them! The good thing about artificial intelligences is that they never get tired or judge you for your quirky little mistakes. Put simply, they can be there for you when no one else can.”

The next morning started like all the others before it. The corporate drones woke up in their small overpriced apartments, left the family at home, took a shovel to Roxxen tower, and waited in line to be crammed into the turbo-lift in order to be delivered to their assigned floor. 
  

  
Incidentally, three of the companies’ hardest and least paid workers enter the Turbo-lift at the same time.

“You catch the game last night?” one of the James asked.
  

  
“Wish I could have!” Frank admitted, “This new acquisition has me working day and night!”—He placed a dark brown briefcase on the floor and rubbed his eyes— “My wife keeps telling me I should just start living here!”
  

  
“Sometimes I feel that I do!” The first man replied. 
  

  
Ashly straightened her skirt before leaning against the back wall of the Turbo-lift. Her makeup was smudged and there were signs of swelling under her left eye.

The overhead lights of the Turbo-lift flickered as the motors lifting the carriage slowed to a stop. came to a stop.
  

  
“Stange,” Ashly pointed out, “I thought there were only server rooms on the lower levels. I’ve never seen anyone get off on level 43.”
  

  
“Me neither,” James agreed. 
  

  
“Don’t look at me!” Frank said, “We’re barely halfway up to my floor!”
  

  
The metal door slid open.
  

  
“Maybe somebody’s getting on?” Ashly said, leaning forward to look out the door open door.
  

  
They waited but no one came. Stanger, the door wouldn’t shut. 
  

  
“I don’t have time for this!” Frank said, pulled a cell phone out of his jacket pocket, “I have a meeting in fifteen minutes!” Frank dialed in his phone and placed it to his ear. 
  

  
“Don’t worry!” James said, “I’ll page IT right away!”
