“You dare intrude into my systems for a mere joke!?” Kraven snapped. If the super computer wasn't so expensive he might have pooched a fist throrugh the monitor right then and there. “Don’t you have a large building to leap or a locomotive to run? Why spend your time pestering me!?”
  

  
The hero lowered he head and rubbed her hands together. She’d stop a moon sized meteor from deroying the earth, defeated the League of shadow, and even single handling put a stop to Captain Metallic. But now her hands were shaking. 
  
 
  
“I-I know, I know this is—Awkward for me too, but...”—She paused and swallowed —“But you’re the only one I can ask...”
  

  
“Me!?” Kraven scoffed, He had never seen the hero like this, not standing proud and resolute as she always had in the past. Instead she looked like an ordinary girl. But he was to wise to fall for what ever trap this was.
  

  
“Why not ask that dainty reporter that's always following you around? Or one of the many member of that cult you call a ‘Fan club!’ I’m sure any one of them would be happy to escort you.”
  

  
“Well, well... that's because”
  

  
Kraven didn't need to hear her answer to know the truth. A vile grimace appeared on his face as he pierced together what was happening.
  

  
“MUHAHAHAH! I see it now!” he bellowed, “I knew that righteous veneer of yours was nothing more than a farce! You are just as underhanded as the rest of us!”
  

  
“Under handed?” she asked. 
  

  
She tried to explain herself but he didn't give her a chance to speak
  

  
“You wish me to kill this EX-lover of yours no? You wish to watch his blood pool on the floor and enjoy the look on his loved ones faces as he breathes his last. You are truly vile! I’m almost impressed”
  

  
“What!? No! No killing!” She ordered. Regaining her heroic stance. “I don’t want you to kill him. Or anyone else at the wedding. I want you to...”
  

  
“Poison him?” Kraven interrupted.
  

  
“Crush his bones!?”
  

  
“Remove an appendage!?”
  

  
“NO! NO! NO! I don’t need you to do anything like that” the hero demanded. “I just need”—her voice became soft and smooth again—“I just need one impressive and cool that's all. 
  

  
There was stunned silence. “It’s just... he’s got a new girlfriend... and a new job... But me... I’m just same boring old me. And there are no dating apps for hero's”
  

  
Kraven nodded his head. This was one thing heroes and villains had in common. 
  

  
“I under stand now. But you still have not answer my question!” he said.
  

  
“I already told you! My ex is gonna be there and...”
  

  
“No,” he raised a hand, “why me of all people? your sworn enemy!.
  

  
“C’mon Kravy!” she smiled, “How long have we know each other now! We’ve had a lot of laughs haven’t we? Vargo, Lemond, that thing with the ducklings!”
  

  
“Speak not of the duckling!” Kraven growled slamming his fist on the wall. “We promised never to speak of the ducklings!”
  

  
“Look, you’re the only one I can count on!”—By the look on his face she could tell he wasn't convinced—“Sure we’ve had our differences but we’ve allways had each other back when it matter most!”
  

  
“I spared your life only to further my own plans! Do not mistake my evil genius for weakness or” His tongue stuck to the top of his moth as he tried to say the word. “Kin-d-ness!”
  

  
“Please!” She asked, “just think of all the intel you could did up at a party like this. Plus I hear there’s gonna be free fondue and even those little brownies you’re always stealing from the barker on 3rd”
  

  
Kraven thought for a moment. “It’s not black tie is it?”
