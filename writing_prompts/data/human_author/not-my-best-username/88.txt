Undercover work has never really been my thing. Control is always trying to convince new recruits and young  hopefuls that undercover assignments are the greatest thing since sliced bread and the easiest way to make a name for yourself in the agency. 
  
 
  
But the truth is, going undercover is the closest you’ll ever get hell on this side of your funeral. 
  

  
Not too long ago the high ups roped a poor pencil-pusher on subfloor 12 into his first undercover job. They told him he’d be a huge help in taking down a notorious smuggling ring. 
  

  
They weren’t wrong but they neglected to mention how he’d do it. 
  

  
Fun fact, rotting fish guts are a great place to hide drugs, dogs don’t like to smell them and most people are more than willing to look the other way if it involves turning their nose in the opposite direction of a rancid fish carcass. 
  

  
Poor guy hasn't been out in the field since. and let just say… he’s probably the furthest From a pescatarian you can get. 
  

  
With this in mind, you can only imagine my excitement when my handle walked in carrying a red binder with my name on it and my newest assignment. 
  

  
I’ve been an agent for over a decade now but even a first year greenie could tell from the look on her face that something was up. 
  

  
The handle usually carries the same sour grimace on her face, only masked slightly by poorly applied makeup and Botox. If I’m remembering correctly... The last time that psycho smiled was… right after her ex-husbands had that skiing ‘accident’ somewhere in the Appalachian mountains.  
  

  
I never looked into it, because I was too scared, but I don't think he was ever found. 
  

  
“Try not to screw it up this time!” She said snidely before tossing the red binder onto the corner of my desk and walked away without bothering to close the door. 
  

  
“Cheers!” I said sarcastically. 
  

  
I rubbed my temples as I looked at the binder for a moment, wondering what horror awaited me on my next assignment. 
  

  
to be honest after the whole Bringston incident I got wrapped up in. I'm fortunate they didn’t chain me up to a desk somewhere in Blackgate or assign me to babysit one of IA’s ‘special’ projects.
  

  
There was no getting around it, this was going to be a rough mission. 
  

  
I quickly skimmed through the file searching for the important information. As usual the first fifteen pages of so were filled with protocol, red tape, and largely redacted cryptic intel. 
  

  
Paper file have a nasty habit of not being shredded and instead ending jpm8n the wrong hand so most of the real info is  contained encrypted O.T.U.D’S or One Time Use Discs if you're new here.  
  

  
Following protocol, I closed my office door and turned off the lights and put my earphones on before popping the disc into my work station. 
  

  
I skipped through the usual “Top Secret” warning that appears on screen and entered my credentials to decrypt the file. 
  

  
“Let’s see what we're up against!” I said. 
  

  
“Good morning agent,” the voice of the recorded message said. “the man your looking at is Jean Paul Baptist”— a head shot of an older French man appeared on screen beside a graphic of four other blacked out faces —“ Baptist is one of five key members of an elite and secretive cabal that is believed be greatly influencing geopolitical events”
  

  
“Intelligence indicates that this cabal is planning to disrupt international peace and security as a part of a secret operation code named C.H.E.F.”
  

  
“While we have not yet known what exactly this operation aims to achieve, we do know that  this man”— \`\`an image of a very Italian-looking man appeared on screen—“ is Davide Marchesi, a world famous chef who is known for his exquisite cuisine and larger than life persona.”
  

  
“More importantly Marchesi has often been seen at events run by Jean Baptist and his associates.“— a collage of images show Jean Paul and Marchesi flash on screen.
  

  
“if reports are correct, Marchemsi has created a recipe with flavors so pure and potent it can alter and control the minds of All those who eat it”
  

  
“Your mission is to infiltrate this cabal, uncover the true aims of operation C.H.E.F and put a stop to it. This message Weiss self destruct in five seconds”
