There’s nothing better than a nice long rest after a hard day’s work. And as a knight of the Aquilaean Republic I have a lot of those, hard workdays, not long rests. 
  

  
But, nothing ruins that sweet, sweet beauty sleep like the thunderous shout of your commanding officer
  

  
“Godfrey!” My commander, Radcliff Glowheart shouted with a booming voice —“Why are you slumbering!?”
  

  
I instinctively snapped to my feet and stood at attention before the bear-of-a-man stormed down the narrow barrack hall, burst through the door, and lodged his great axe into the wooden frame of my bunk
  

  
 “I thought I told you to take out the bloody dragon!” He shouted not even an inch from my face. 
  

  
“Yeah,” I said whupping the sleep from my eye, “we had dinner... watched a play... we even took a stroll by the great river. She’s quite charming actually… Pity about the amphitheater though. You’d think after its burned down so many times they’d rebuild with finer materials, anywho, the show must go on as they say” I said, proud of my accomplishments. 
  

  
Commander Glowheart stood there with a blank expression on his face, no doubt awestruck by the incredible work I reasoned. 
  

  
I don’t think I’ve ever seen the old man smile. It’s like the years of strength training have sculpted a grizzled frown onto his face. Even since I joined this battalion one of my goals has been to make him proud of the warrior he trained me to be.
  

  
“I’m telling you, If you’d been there you’d been proud,” I said, “As you know I’ve always been maiden-less so at first, I wasn’t sure of what to do, especially with a dragon no less... But then I remembered something my grandmother was always saying ‘No matter what she may look like she’d say ‘treat a maiden like a maiden and she’ll be your maiden forever!’ So that's what exactly what I did I-”
  

  
“WHAT!?” Glowheart snorted, “You’ve been... courting the dragon!?” 
  

  
“Yes Sir,” I saluted, “I took out the dragon just as you instrucrte-”
  

  
Chips of wood fell to the floor as commander Glowheart tore the great axe out of the bedframe and raised it over my head—“Boy! If you were any other man I’d cut you down where you stand! I didn’t ask you to smoose the bleeding thing! I” — He stepped back, shook his head, and ran his scarred hand through his beard before taking a big breath. — “Little closely boy, I want you to TAKE A SWORD AND RUN IT THROUGH THE BLOODY DRAGON’S HEART! YOU GOT THAT!?” Glowheart screamed at the top of his lungs. 
  

  
“Sir Yes Sir!” I said before giving my commander a salute. 
  

  
Truth be told,  though our time together was short, I’d grown quite fond of that dragon, It was as if could feel a deep bond had formed between us, Her and I. Alas, orders are order and I am a knight of the proud Aquilaean Republic!
  

  
With a heavy Heart, vexed spirit, and disquieted mind, I readied my most powerful sword, one I was sure would kill the dragon. And when all was said and done, when I returned to my barrack after fulfilling my weighty duty as a knight and a protector of the land yes, after a long and hard campaign was complete and the battle was done, I couldn't help but feel that part of me, some part of my heart was still with that dragon. 
  

  
And as my mind drifted off to sleep I lone tear ran down my cheek. It was done. 
  

  
The next morning I rose before the sun with a pounding in my chest. And stepping outside into the foggy darkness I noticed Commander Glowheart riding towards the barrack in a hurry!
  

  
A plume of rich earth followed behind the hooves of the rushing beast beneath him as the thunder sound of its gallup grew louder and louder. 
  

  
I quickly took a lantern off its holder, lit it, and rushed through the morning fog to meet him. 
  

  
“What has happened commander!” I called out,
  

  
Without answering me the commander leaped off his mount ran towards me and lifted me up by the collar of my shirt. A hero's embrace!
  

  
“GODFREY!” He shouted shaking me violently “I told you to take a sword and run it THROUGH THE BLOODY DRAGON’S HEART!
  

  
“Yes sir! I did just that!” I said proudly, “And I didn't use just a sword! No no, I used the most powerful sword my hands could wield. You should have seen it, sir! The look on Saphira’s face as the words of my sonnet pierced through her heart like a mighty sword! You see, not even a dragon's scales can withstand the stabs of a  pen, for it is far more mighty than the sword!”
  

  
Glowheart's eyes widened as he slowly lowered me to the ground.
  

  
“You’ve... you’ve named the dragon!?” he asked.
