**~~Fryday~~** **Friday, 10/12/32**

Doctor Frasier made his diagnosis earlier today. According to him while I’m not diluted, I do have an overactive imagination.

He wanted to prescribe me some pills but I can’t afford them. Even if I could I’m not so sure he’s right.

If it really is ‘just my imagination’ then why does it only happen at night? Why can I hear it only in my bedroom and why does the knocking starts only when I’m completely alone?

Worrying about it now won't help me sleep.

Tom said he’d get the blueprints of the house to me within a week. Once I have them I’ll know for sure what, if anything, is behind that wall.

**Thursday 10/18/32**

It’s happening more often. It’s even louder now.

I started this journal so I could read my thought back when my head is more clear. But this is all getting to be too much.

Tom told me he got a hold of the blueprints over a week ago but he stopped replying to my messages. He won't even pick up his phone.

I bet the %$\*# forgot about me and went on vacation...

**Saturday 10/20/32**

Still no word from Tom. I’ll have to walk into the shop if I’m going to get any answers. Looks like he changed his number...

I noticed something else with the mirror. I don’t know what it is but it doesn't look right... I don’t look right. It’s like I'm staring at someone ~~elses~~ reflection. ~~His reflection~~

Something with ~~its~~ the eyes...

I couldn't sleep so I washed it off but as I did it was like watching someone else clean the mirror.

I’m all mixed up. I need to make an appointment with Dr. Frasier. I should be able to afford it when I get paid on Monday.

**Monday 10/22/32**

$H#\*! The B@$&! retired without warning me!

I have no one else to talk to about this. Everyone will just think I’m crazy!

I need to deal with this myself.

**11/02/32**

Everyones gone. Tom, Dr. Frasier, \[illegible\] the dog.

I was going to end it. I was going break the mirror. I bought a hammer... I had a plan. But but when the time came I couldn't do it. It was like hitting that man in the mirror would be hitting myself.

There’s something ~~leach~~ leaking from the rim of the mirror. It looks like motor oil and it smells sweet. Almost like Iron.

$H\*(! I'm so stupid! I don’t know what to do. Every plant in that room has wilted away.

**11/11/11**
  
KNOCK, **KNOCK**, KNOCK, **KN**OCK! 
  

  
It’s all I \[illegible\] hear now. T~~he~~ the \[illegible\] won't stop! When I look ~~for~~ in the mirror there's a big smile on ~~mmy~~ face . But I know I'm ~~not~~ smiling! \[illegible\]. It’s getting ~~let~~ harder and harder to look away. 
  

  
The knocks are calling to me. \[illegible\] me, asking me to open. ~~let  me~~ To open the window but how? How can \[illegible\]. ~~LeTMEiN~~
