I'll probably edit it later when I have the time.

You would think with national security on the line and our multi-multi billion dollar budget The Head Office would spring for some decent flight accommodations at least. I’m not saying I need to fly first-class or anything but- Economy... Really? 
  

  
And don't get me started on the THREE layovers I had to get endure. On its own, a ten-hour flight is bad enough, but after it was all said and done, it turned into an 18-hour ordeal!
  

  
By the time I touched down at the Bergerac Dordogne Périgord Airport in the southwest of France I was already feeling like warmed-over garbage which only made the next step in my mission that much harder. 
  

  
Stepping out of the terminal I was greeted by the typical airport ambiance, the sound of hundreds of people bustling around mixed with sporadic announcements playing over the PA system, and the cries of travel-weary toddlers.
  

  
According to my orders, my first contact was a middle-aged Frenchmen wearing a grey suit, a red tie, and a blower hat. And as I stepped down the stairs I saw a man just like that holding a white cardboard sign with the name of my new identity written on it, Maximilian Budapest the self-made millionaire turned globetrotter Foodie.
  

  
Typically when impersonating a high-class personality you want to make a grand and explosive entrance of some kind, something that says “I’m very rich and very important.”
  

  
Unfortunately for me, however, the group I was trying to infiltrate are some crazy radical ascetics that view spending money on anything other than food as a cardinal sin.
  

  
And apparently, the only way to get a meeting with one of them is to bring a rare delicacy that they’ve never tasted before. My job was to meet up with my designated contact in Dordogne and retrieve some ancient Georgian wine The Head Office probably spent the majority of my mission budget on. 
  

  
After trudging through French customs and finally making it out of the airport I took a scenic drive down the countryside to a rural town not far from the coast and about as far from Paris as you can get without leaving the French border. 
  

  
The driver dropped me off outside an ancient look house with cobblestone walls and a tall almost bell-shaped roof. 
  

  
I stepped up to the door and knocked the encoded knock: Three loud knocks followed by four quiet knocks followed by another three loud knocks. 
  

  
A second later the door opened and a short odd-looking man answered. He had unkept wiry hair, a poorly trimmed beard, and wore an oversized grey, brown and military green scarf. 
  

  
“What brings you to my humble chateau ?” he asked enthusiastically.
  

  
“I hear there are great places to drink around here,” I replied. 
  

  
“Only if you have enough coin and a strong stomach!” He said
  

  
“I have the coin,” I said, almost forgetting my next line, “but we’ll have and see if your stomach is up to the task.”
  

  
Encoded greetings are hard to remember in your native language as it is. Saying it in another language without sounding like an understudy in a school play can trip up even the most seasoned operatives.
  

  
Thankfully I am one of the best. 
  

  
As soon as he welcomed me into the house he dropped the French ancient replacing it with his native new yorker accent
  

  
“Fricken ay!” He said gesturing grandly, “What took you so long!? I’ve been held up here for weeks! Nothing to do, no good TV no good food... The steaks are all undercooked and they got no good bear here!”
  

  
The inside of the house was a mess. It looked like five board college kids had a stakeout and rearranged the furniture half a dozen times. 
  

  
I followed him as he spoke to the small kitchen where an old TV with bunny ears was propped up on a box beside a small window beside the sink. 
  

  
He pointed to a dark brown wooden crate that was partially covered by a red cloth— “That's what you're here for! Qvevri Wine, And you won't believe what I had to go through just to get it!”
  

  
“For some reason, the Georgians see winemaking as some big spiritual process! And drinking the stuff is their way talk’en to god or something! When I drink a beer I'm just trying to take the edge off you know, go to bed a little early.”
  

  
“I practically had to convert just to make them take my money! And all for some friggen ancient grape juice!”—He swore under his breath before slamming his hands down and leaning on the counter. 
  

  
“I’m not trying to give’ya a hard time or anything but, if you screw this up, I might have a heart attack, got it!?” he concluded. 
  

  
“I got it, boss!”— I said looking over the crate — “No screw-ups and I’ll make sure you didn't waste your time here I promise! ”
  


—Château de Commarque
  

  
From the outside, the 12th country French castle looked like it was somehow part of the landscape the light grey, tan and yellowing bricks towered over the green hillside like a monolith o an ancient past.
  

  
Apparently, Jean Baptist slowly restored most of the castle in honor of a great chef who once served a lord in the area. The grounds were covered with guards and black water security but if our intel was correct careful timing and the crate of wine in my hand would be all I needed to get in. 
  

  
On the lawn outside the castle, I spotted Baptist walking around with a glass of red wine in his hand and bodyguards flanking him. 
  

  
What I didn’t spot was the overly aggressive guard that was sneaking up behind me. Before I knew it someone had kicked me behind the knee and pushed me to the ground by my shoulders causing me to slam the wine crate into the ground. 
  

  
“What are you doing here!” The voice from behind me asked.
  

  
“Are you crazy!” I yelled hoping to get Baptists' attention.  “This is one of the rarest wines in the World and you almost made me drop it!”
  

  
I pushed back off the ground only to be stopped by the familiar cold touch of a guns barrel on the back of my head.
  

  
“Don’t move a muscle trespasser!” the guard said before pushing back down to my knees. 
  

  
“Not to worry mon amie!” John Baptist called out from the distance, “Can’t you see our friend is barres a gift? Let him pass and if the wine in that crate is unsatisfactory, ill let you do to him whatever you want.” The rotund Frenchmen waved off his security detail and motioned for me to approach. 
  

  
It was show time.
