**Ran out of space sorry! below is ending of part 2.** 

With that out of he way I was on my way to clock out, pick up my laptop, and get back to my writing. 
  

  
I left my office and made my way down the hallway towards the security office. But as I got closer the security admins desk I could feel something was off.
  

  
The security admin was sitting behind his desk leaning back in his chair with his feet on his desk and a perplexed look on his face. 
  

  
“Did something happen?” I asked leaning with an elbow on the desk. 
  
“Yeah, you could say that!” —he leaned down and retrieved my laptop bag from his   
drawer before placing it on the desk in front of me— “Buch of suits from up stairs   
payed me a visit... they wanted to have a look at something on you laptop... They don't   
just come down here for no reason...”
  

  
I quickly opened the bag and powered on the laptop. Although only took a second it felt like I was staring at the loading screen for years!
  

  
I opened the document I had been working on and —It was gone. my story— Erased?
