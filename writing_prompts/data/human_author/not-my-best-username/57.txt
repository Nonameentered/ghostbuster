Henchmen for hire part 5
  

  
\-Partners and crime. 
  

  
Duke shielded his eyes from the flurry of blinding lights as another atomic pulse blasted into Frostbite's icy shield. As impressive as it was that her shield had deflected the first blast,  it was only a glancing blow. 
  

  
Captains a critical second shot hit its mark squarely, sending huge chunks of ice hurling across the room. It took everything Frostbite had just to stay standing.
  

  
Her legs shook, the thick frozen mist that usually surrendered her dissipated, and there was a bead of sweat on her brow. She was almost out of strength. 
  

  
“I told you kid, get out of here! You’ve only got a few seconds before he’s done charging up! Go! Go!”
  

  
Duke knew what he had to do next. As much as idolized Captain Critical, Duke like so many other heroes knew that it was only a matter of time before the captain’s powers would be used for evil just like they had been when he was mind-controlled by Dr. Mindplex three years ago. 
  

  
If Omega Women had been there to stop him, Metro city would be nothing more than a radioactive crater by the sea. 
  

  
Duke had prepared for this moment. 
  

  
“Cover me! And hold your breath!” Duke shouted before making a break for the door. 
  

  
Captain Critical didn’t spare Duke a second glance. He didn’t see him as a threat and he was used to people running away from him. 
  

  
He was so unphased by Duke that he didn’t even notice the gunmetal grey grenade that Duke expertly tossed at his feet.
  

  
Captain Critical scoffed, “you really think a little grenade can do anythi-“ the grenade exploded into a thick grey cloud of powderized lead that completely coated captain critical body. 
  

  
When Captain Critical tried to fire his next blast the dense lead coating caused the atomic energies to reflect back at Captain critical creating a localized feedback-loop. 
  

  
A massive explosion erupted from Captain Critical's fingertips, sending him flying backward through one of the warehouse walls and a spray of debris skittering around the room. 
  

  
Duke was caught off guard by the magnitude of the resulting shockwave! He was tossed into the air and thrown shoulder first against the wall like a rag doll thrown by an angry toddler. 
  

  
He was left laying flat on the floor with a pounding in his head, a ringing in his ear, and a dislocated shoulder. 
  

  
He watched in all motion as a huge chunk of the roof above him broke off and began to tumble towards him. 
  

  
He tried to get out of the way but his body wouldn’t respond. Duke wants to be built to fight superhumans. 
  

  
He closed his eyes and waited but the impact never came, instead, a wash of icy cold air washed over his face. Duke opened his eyes to see a sheet of thick ice barely holding the ceiling above him together.
  

  
Duke forced himself to stand making eye contact with Frostbite just as she collapsed into an exhausted heap on the floor. she had used the last of her strength to save Duke's life. 
  

  
Ignoring her pain Duke willed his body to move as fast as he towards Frostbite.
  

  
Concert, rebar, and shards of the ceiling fell all around him as he lunged towards Frostbite, throwing his body on top of hers to shield her from the falling rubble.
  

  
If Duke had only been wearing his suit he probably could have taken that hit without blacking out.
