Looking through his old things was a strange experience, like diving into a world you’d heard about in hushed whispers, rumors, and fairy tales. Both familiar and completely surprising at the same time. 
  

  
I collected the few nicknacks that lay on the nightstand beside the metal-framed bed which was untidily draped by an old worn-out blanket and throw pillow that looked as if they belonged in a museum. 
  

  
The only things worth taking were his watch, his lighter, and a decades-old tattered newspaper plastered with coffee stains. 
  

  
I placed it all in the box I’d been carrying from the room collecting what I didn’t want to be sold in the estate sale.
  

  
Holding the box on my hip I walked out of the room and rounded the corner towards the final room on my to-do list. 
  

  
I can’t explain why but, I’d been struggling all day just to step foot in that room. The door to his office seemed larger and taller than all the others... like I was still looking at it through the same eyes I did when I was a child. Like I still hadn't grown in all these years. 
  

  
I stood in front of the oak door for a moment staring at the brass knob covered with indelicate castings. 
  

  
Maybe it was because my father had forbidden me from ever going in there since I was a child. Or maybe I simply hated that room because of what it did to me. 
  

  
Father has only been gone now a little over a month, but it felt like he’d been dead for decades now. 
  

  
Every earning he’d spend hours in other working on the “projects” he was always so obsessed with. But once mom died that obsession only grew. Hours stretched into days, days to weeks, sometimes I’d sit by the door crying, imagining he’d died of starvation. Other times I’d hear him sobbing and slamming his fists on the desk. 
  

  
I turned the knob, pushed, and watched as the door slowly creaked open revealing a room that I can only describe as a massive rat's nest. 
  

  
The Metal bins and cardboard boxes that lined the four walls were overflowing with files and documents. Binders and folders cascaded down from the stacks of boxes towards the center of the room to where a battered desk sat covered with papers and binders. 
  

  
I nearly vomited as the stench hit me, the putrid mixture of old coffee, rotting food, and cigarette smoke assaulted my senses sending me spiraling back out of the room. 
  

  
I stumbled backward and slid with my back against the wall sitting in the hall like I did as a child and waited for the room to air out a bit before trying again. 
  

  
Leaving the box on the floor I pushed off the floor and entered the room for the second time covering my mouth and nose with a hand.
  

  
Doing a quick scan of the room I noticed the seemingly random assortment of items that were scattered all around. No one item seemed to relate in the slightest to the next. 
  

  
In one corner, pinned into a box was a street sign with sticky notes posted to it listing several dates, names, and telephone numbers. To the right of that was a grandfather clock with its face smashed and its hands missing.
  

  
The only area that showed a semblance of order was on the desk where stacks of papers were arranged in a u-shape around an old book that lay face down just in front of the brown office chair.
  

  
The book was fairly large, perhaps the size of a history book or dictionary. It had a cracked red leather cover and a brown spine that was hanging on by a thread.
  
 
  
I picked up the book and carried it under my arm out of the room, still unable to bear the smell for more than a few minutes. 
  

  
I walked back down the hall to the living room and sat on the old couch facing the kitchen.  
  

  
The title of the book was written in a language I couldn’t understand maybe Latin or a similarly old dialect, the same was true of the first few pages.
  
 
  
With nothing to do until I could find a way to deal with the stench, I continued flipping through pages hoping to stumble upon some interesting artwork or illustrations.
  

  
But, to my surprise, about twenty or so pages in the language changed to old English. Filled with all the “thine”, “thee”, and “thous” you’d expect.
  

  
It was a bit difficult to read at first but it told the story of the death of an old queen and how it lead to the downfall of an entire nation. A few pages later it explained how the invention of Greek fire led to untold destruction and misery. 
  

  
The next story was about a beloved leader who was assassinated by a man at a play he was attending. The next story was about a terrorist attack involving two massive towers and two metal birds. That changed the course of history. 
  

  
But I knew these stories... not all the detail were here and the writing was a bit abstract but some of the events listed in the book had happened in my lifetime.
  

  
Why were recent tragedies written in old English? I wondered. More importantly, when were they written?
  

  
I was only at the beginning of the book but there were so many pages left to read.
