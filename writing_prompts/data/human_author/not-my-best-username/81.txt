The first few loops were enjoyable enough, even a bit therapeutic. I looked at it as a forced vacation, A nice rest bit, on a beautiful and mostly uninhabited planet surrounded by nature and scenery, from the typical hustle, bustle, and danger that seems to have a death grip on my life. 
  

  
And the great thing about a vacation in a time loop is that the fun never has to end! You can live the same days and make small little adjustments to enjoy unique adventures thanks to the near-infinite number of possibilities, all without aging. Theoretically, that is!
  

  
But as all temporal physicists know, The Web of Time isn't so simple, it has a way of nickeling and diming you. Either you pay now or all at once later.
  

  
I began to feel the weight of living so long in a loop as the tachyon-filled time winds beat against the rudimentary bespoke shielding I’d cobbled together. 
  

  
A covered my eyes with the sleeve of my jacket as sparks flew from the active heart of the control console.
  

  
“Hold yourself together, old thing!” I yelled to the machine, “Just a little further we’re nearly through the barrier!”
  

  
The time rotors wobbled and screamed as the rush of temporal energies hissed and surged through the system. Even for a time loop of this size, you wouldn't expect to see so much resistance. The barrier was far too thick to be naturally occurring as I assumed! 
  

  
I spent the better part of five minutes which, temporarily speaking is close to a lifetime, chipping away at the time-space barrier in a brute force attempt to breakthrough.
  

  
But, every time I thought I’d made a bit of progress the localized temporal energy would condense pushing down against the ship’s shielding, repelling me back deeper into the time loop.
  
 
  
It was as if a metal dome had been purposely erected around the time vector. With the engines threatening to over heart and no progress in sight, I did my best to touch down as close to the beginning of my personal time stream on this planet as possible. Where, logically, the barrier should be at its weakest. 
  

  
I fought against the controls and tried to keep my footing as the temporal flux dissipated and local time reasserted itself outside the capsule. 
  

  
Schrodinger's cat was out of the box but where?
  

  
Piloting such a small ship, your can navigational error rate is in the double digits. I was displeased more than fifty miles from the coordinates I’d been aiming for. 
  

  
A bellow of smoke rose from the counsel filling filled the room as the overworked engines sputtered to a halt. Stepping outside I checked my temporal pocket watch and did some quick maths in my head. 
  

  
“Let's see!” I said to myself, “If my calculations are correct, which they usually are… this is… day ‘R’… so... The first day I got here...”
  

  
As good news goes this wasn't the greatest. Sure I’d made progress, I was now in possession of a functional time capsule, but I didn’t know how I had gotten here in the first place. Perhaps this was how I’d arrived here in the first place. This same time capsule, this same time loop. Or maybe this was just another part of the loop or a fractured loop within the loop.
  

  
My spinning thoughts were interrupted by the soft voice of a woman standing behind me.
  

  
“Did you say it was your first day here?” She asked,
  

  
I turned around to face the woman, or female humanoid at the very least, who was standing on a small mound not far from a field of crops. 
  

  
In all my travels I’d never come across a race quite like the Tamzin’s. On average they are slightly smaller than humans, they have four arms, pale purplish skin, and small horn-like appendages that grow from their foreheads. But what makes them special are their minds. 
  

  
Their empaths you see. Nothing like those nosey telepaths that are always trying to get a peek at what’s under the hood, Tamzins feel the emotions of those around them, and express their own emotions through the color of their bio-chromatic hair.
  

  
Red hair is a sign of anger, yellow of happiness, dark blues or blacks can be a sign of fear or sadness and their hair turns white upon death.
  

  
The color of the Tamzin standing in front of me was a dirty blonde. So… confused, a bit stressed but still a tad happy to see me. 
  

  
“Sorry!” I said, realizing I’d been blankly staring at her lost in thought, “I’m Professor John Smith, and yes, this is my first time in this particular region, I was testing out my transport over there, and… it appears, I was knocked off course and ended up your lovely field here!”—I gesture apologetically towards the eyesore I call a ship—“sorry for the intrusion! Once I’ve done some repairs I’ll be back on my way!”
  

  
“No apologies are in order! Professor Smith,” she said, “My name I Kor’el Zapherin, and that field has not been in use for some time.”
  

  
“The Tamzin welcome all outsiders and even off-worlders like yourself, to our humble planet”—Her hair turned a powdery pink, the traditional color of peace in this part of the galaxy—“Please, I can sense you are tired, won't you come to take some refreshments in the village?”
  

  
“That sounds absolutely lovely!” I said, stretching my back, “It will be some time before the engine is cool enough for me to work on safely. And, as you say I could do with a break!”
  

  
I followed her lead down a dirt path towards a decent-sized village that was not too far in the distance. But as we got closer to the village I felt an eerie feeling deep inside my mind like, something terrible was just about to happen. 
  

  
“What’s troubling you!?” Kor’el asked, sensing my uneasiness.
  

  
“That’s the question isn't it!” I said, “I can't quite put my finger on this feeling... But I know I’ve experienced it before.”
  

  
A grabbed my head as something sharpy pierced through my psyche. 
  

  
Overhead dark cracks appeared, dotting the horizon above the village. Black and purple mist spewed from the cracks as they widened allowing the massive wings of those all too familiar and terrible creatures to smash their way through temporal space like rotting butterflies emerging from rancid cacoons    
  

  
“Time Wraiths!!” I said looking up at the four-winged inky black creatures
