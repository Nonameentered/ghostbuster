Seated at a large round table surrounded by a hoard of armor-bound men and rows of intimidatingly muscular women was Justin, a man who had dropped out of college to become a streamer on flinch.tv 
  

  
At first, he didn’t think he’d fit in here but the more he spoke and the more outlandish tale he told the more they loved him. 
  

  
“So anyway I started blast’n!” Justin continued, his words strong and sharp.
  

  
A strong hand slammed into the back of his shoulder as Varfellow, a Brudish knight who had died protecting his countrymen, patted Justin on his back for the fourth or fifth time in a row.
  

  
Justin was beginning to wonder if he could be hurt in Valhalla if a sudden bruise would appear on his skin and reveal the truth, the reality that he is not a warrior. 
  

  
Even in death, he couldn’t escape the imposter syndrome felt all his life. 
  

  
“Tell is boy! There is one thing we’re all dying to know,” Valfellow said raising his voice to be heard over the commotion of the crowd, “we’re ye able to avenge yer friend? Aeirth? That beautiful flower las?
  

  
Justin sunk in his seat slightly, dropping his head to stare blankly into his mug. Aeirths tragic passing was the first video game death that actually affected him. He cried for weeks and refused even to pick the game back up for a month or so after it happened. 
  

  
“It took decades!” Justin said, finally breaking the silence, “I had to wait decades just to face him again.
  

  
The battle took place on holy ground, on a battlefield by the name of Final Destination! A place where mainly a battle was won or lost, a place where dreams either come true or are crushed to dust.”
  

  
The name of this “sacred” battlefield was enough to give validity to his tale. The room grew ever more quiet as Justin spoke.
  

  
“The match was ferocious from the start! The white-haired man lunged forward, drawing his sword and air-dashing before unleashing a flurry of blinding fast attacks.
  

  
I barely had enough time to react and put up my shield before impact. In doing so I saved myself from the classic zero-to-death he’s known for!”
  

  
But that wasn’t the only thing I had to worry about. If only my C-stick wasn’t still broken after the last tourney I could have punished him out of shield, made him pay for rushing in so quickly!
  

  
Instead was driven back by his massive sword, forced to retreat to the ledge as he continued to throw out a barrage of attacks!”
  

  
Our swords clashed when I made a push to center stage. He was fast but I got the better end of the trade! I pushed him back and tech chased him through the air as he tried to avoid my attacks. I landed a good number of blows but I wasn't expecting him to throw out a counter in the middle of my combo!
  

  
I was sent flying back and sent crashing into a stage hazard which only opened me up more to his savage counterattack! 
  

  
I thought I’d be beaten then and there, two stocked without a chance for redemption but I didn't give up.
  

  
Tooth and nail, attack after attack,  I clawed my way back to equal footing. In the end, it came down to final stock. One blow would decide the victor of this battle.”
  

  
“What did you do lad!?” A voice called out “ how did you beat that monster!?”
  

  
A smile grew on Justin’s face. “Up-B, Down-B, Down special…. FINAL SMASH!” 
  

  
Although nobody knew exactly what he was talking about it sounded good so the room erupted into cheers and hollers. Some men cried tears of joy while others raised their hands in the air and shouted.
  

  
“Justin is cracked! JUSTIN IS CRACKED!” they cheered.
