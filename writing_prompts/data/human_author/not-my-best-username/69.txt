“Before you can defeat the criminal element, you first must understand it!” That’s what Captain Critical would say whenever he concluded one of his rousing and motivational speeches be it at a school, a job fair, or a high-class fundraiser.

Duke Dixon was nothing like Captain Critical. He had no cool powers, no snazzy catchphrase, no chiseled bulletproof jawline, and no, he’s never stopped a nuclear reactor from going critical with his bare hands. But, he was a hero nonetheless, a hero that wanted to get better, a hero to make a difference so he took the captain's words to heart.

But how can you understand the criminal mind? Duke wondered as he sat on the couch in his living room, leaning back with his feet resting on the corner coffee table perched between two or three empty pizza boxes.

Whether it was fifth grade math, baking, or tying his shoes, Duke needed hands-on learning.

“You’re a doer, not a studier!” He could still remember his father's wise words.

Duke sprung off his back and quickly ruffled through the random assortment so of items on his able, reaching between two pizza boxes he retrieved a newspaper and quickly turned to the back page.

“Villainy, Violence, and Paid Vacation! The Henchmen training workshop!” the headline of the ad read

“Are you tired of being locked in the slammer after every job? Tired of court fees and fines bringing your profits down? Are superheroes a super pain in your neck? Well, this workshop might be just for you!”

“Perfect!” Duke cheered holding the newspaper, “This is just what I need!”

A few hours later Duke was standing in a long line outside an abandoned warehouse on the corner of Olive and 23rd dressed in his finest henchmen attire and trying his best not to stand out.

He kept his head down and listened to the conversation going on around him.

“You wouldn't believe it!” one man said, “I went to the workshop last week and my phone’s been ringing off the hook!”—He gestured grandly and let out a big belly laugh—” I even got a job offer from Dr. Doof!”

“Son of a gun! I knew you had it in you” another man replied, “I bet you’ll be henchmen of the month and no time!”

“Shoot!” the first man said

The henchmen were far friendlier than Duke was expected, If he didn't know better he’d think he was waiting in line at Comic-Con, surrounded by nerds and enthusiast all waiting to meet their favorite author, not a bunch of thugs and killers he’d never waste a second punch on normally.

He mulled this over in his mind as he waited to get to the front of the line. What did it really mean to be a henchman? He wondered.

“What does it mean to be henchmen!?” a man said standing in the middle of the room. “A lot of other villains will tell you that henchmen are nothing more than a bunch o low-life thugs! Hired guns, cannon fodder to slow down your friendly neighborhood webhead! I’m here to tell you that you’re more than that!”

“In fact, without good working-class henchmen like yourselves, without the backbone of crime and villainy, supervillains would be super screwed!”

—The room ignited into laughter.

“In this workshop, you’ll learn how to be the best henchmen you can be! You’ll go from zero to defeating a hero and three easy steps! And trust me when I tell you, you won’t want to miss our expert panel with none other than Frostbite herself!”

Frostbite!? Duke thought to himself, she’s been in hiding for months!
