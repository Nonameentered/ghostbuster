The room was bathed in a wash of red light as the GNN logo flashed across Batcomputer’s screen in spectacular fashion.  
  

  
“Tonight the race to evacuate as the Wayne Foundation faces another in a long list of setbacks in recent months!”The red-headed news anchor said as footage of the city and graphics displayed on screen.
  

  
“Freak Hurrican Martha has already devastated most of Bruce Wayne's controversial affordable house project on the Westend. According to one insider report, nearly half of Wayne's thirty-two-million dollar housing fund has already been washed away by Martha. Leaving dozens of homes only partially constructed  and hundreds of Gothamites without a place to weather out the storm!” 
  

  
Bruce leaned forward and rubbed his eyes, causing his cowl to fold backward and rest on his back.  
  

  
“It’s good to see our hard work hasn’t gone unpunished...” Alfred said with his usual sarcasm. “Dare to say I was beginning to believe that Bruce Wayne was having a bigger impact than the Caped Crusader!”
  

  
“This storm is months too early!” Bruce said before quickly pulling up meteorological data on screen. “Somebody has to be behind this. but who stands to gain from this?”
  

  
“Mr. Freeze?” Alfred asked as he peered up at the massive screens.
  

  
“No.” Bruce said, “Jason was just checked up on him. He’s safe in Arkham for the moment. And with Wayne Tech researching his wife's condition this hurts him more than anyone else.” 
  

  
Bruce thought for a moment before shaking his head “Either way I won’t find the answer here.” —Bruce stood and pulled the cowl over his face. “I need to get out there. The city needs me.” 
  

  
“That is true However”—As Bruce turn around Alfred gave him a look that made him pause—“Are you sure this suite is the one you should be going out in?” Alfred asked his tone expressing what he thought, “I’m sure there are a lot of people who’d welcome a visit from Bruce Wayne right now.”
  

  
Bruce narrowed his eyes but didn't respond. Instead, he look at the Wayne logo that was beveled in the button of Alfred's jacket.
  

  
“Master Drake, Tod, and Cain are working hard and out patrolling as we speak. And With miss Gordan watching over them the city is in capable hands.”
  

  
“Maybe but” —Bruce sighed and lifted the cowl off his face—“I’m not sure what Bruce Wayne can do right now...”
  

  
“The same thing he’s always done. Take orphans and stays out of the cold, dark, shadows and give them a chance at a life he never had. ” Alfred said.
  

  
Bruce's expression remained stoic but Alfred knew he’s made his point. “Shall I bring the car around sir?”
