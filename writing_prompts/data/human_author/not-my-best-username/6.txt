“I know I broke a law, but I plead not guilty because that law is stupid.”

The courtroom was filled horrid gasped and the faint sound of his lawyer looing his mind.

The Honorable judge Barret slammed the gavel down hard on the podium before letting our a frustrated huff. “Order in the court! Order in the Court!” He was almost shouting. “There will be order in my court”

The defendant sat back down prompting is Lawyer to snap to his feet.

“Your Honor!” He said, leaving the honorific hanging in the air so he could think for a moment. “What ever one thinks of my client, and from their reaction, many don’t seem to like him. We cannot dispute the fact that the law was created for the protection of man. Not the man for the law!”

The judged peered over his glasses. The defense attorney was standing on thin ice so he chose his next works carefully.

“Who cares if he ‘stole’ From that Mickie D’s!? Who cares if he ‘Barrowed’ The Ice cream machine. It’s broken 90% of the time anyway!”

“The LAW cares Mr. Goodmen!” The judge snared, “I shouldn't have to remind you of that!”

“Than the law Is wrong!” he replied with out hesitation. “Studies shows that restaurants throw 27% of all they produce in a day! With a restaurant chain this big, that’s enough to feed 3500 house holds for a whole week! And that’s what my Client did!”

Before the lawyer could continue the defendant stood and interrupted.

“Heck yeah dawg! That’s my Lawyer right there!”
