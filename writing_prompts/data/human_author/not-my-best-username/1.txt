Powerman pounded a clenched fist on the round table before pointing an accusing finger at Quick Lash who sat opposite him wearing his signature red onesie. “You can’t just run through all your problems Dick! You might be able to phase through the walls, but, what about the rest of us!?”
  

  
 “Aren't you supposed to be faster than a train or something!? Just keep up! And what did we agree about using real names when we’re arguing!? It makes it way to personal man!”
  

  
Ultra women sat up in her chair to intervene like she always did whenever they got into a pissing match like this. “Powerman is right.” she said, barely holding her frustration at bay, “We’re a team. We can’t just let you run in there to fight on your own. What are we supposed to do if you were overwhelmed? We need to find a way to get us all into the castle!”  
  

  
Quick Lash saw her point but didn't concede his own. “We’ll I’m out of Ideas!”—He folded his arms—“You’ve shot down everything I’ve come up with! And our resident brain box is off somewhere brooding again!”
  

  
“We have to find a way. It’s what we do!” Ultra Woman said, her voice resounding like she was giving one of her renowned  long-winded speeches. “We are The League! We just need to put our heads together and think.”
  

  
“Have you tried calling her?” Powerman asked, “She’s a bit moody, but plans have always been her thing.”
  

  
“You’re right” Ultra Woman replied. “But you know how she is. She’ll be here when she wants to be. Until then we’ll have to figure this out on our own. ”
  

  
Just then, one of the interns walked in to do some needed repairs on a lighting fixture that had broken a few weeks prior. He wore a reflective safety vest and carried a ladder at his side.
  

  
“Sorry!” he apologized for his intrusion before setting up the ladder and getting to work. Not that anyone noticed. 
  

  
Quick Lashe’s face lit up as a  brilliant idea popped into His mind. The answer was staring him in the face the whole time! 
  

  
“I got it!” He began explaining his genius but his mind moved so quickly that his mouth could barely keep up. “What if we take the castle and Push it somewhere else!”
  

  
“We’re not doing that!” Powerman said with a groan, “That last time we tried something you saw in a cartoon... I don’t even want to talk about it... I haven’t been able to eat fish in months!”
  

  
“Oh, C’mon man! It worked for Patrick. Why won’t it work for us!” Quick Lash said in his defense.“Man I really wish that owl was around. She’s cranky but hot! And her Ideas are the best!”
  

  
A split second later an owl-shaped throwing knife stuck itself between two of his fingers.
  

  
“I’m glad to hear you like my plans!” the dark clad figure said from atop the ladder.
  

  
“Holey dude!” Quick Lash said, “How long have you been listening? How did you even get in here!?”
  

  
Her long black cape fluttered behind her as she leaped off the ladder and landed softly in the room. 
  

  
“The same way we’re getting into that castle.” she said, both offering both an answer to his question and the solution to their problem.
