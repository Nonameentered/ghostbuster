I don’t know how long I’d been standing in that library, just reading the same old book over and over again in a seemingly endless loop.

I’d been so long science I’d done anything fun like exploring or god forbid doing a quest. But, things didn't always use to be this way—Or at least... I don't think so...

You know, sometimes I hear villagers talking about their childhoods or growing up in a small town, but, the first thing I remember is defeating that Great Orc by hiding in a corner so he couldn't hit me and swinging at his knees for about an hour until he finally died.

Recently I’ve felt compelled to do the same mundane thing over and over again, Ike reading this book.

Finally, After getting through the book for what must have been the ten-thousandth time, the fantastical music filled the room and the usual white text appeared in front of my eyes.

                               —Intellect level up—
    
                         \--\[LV. 99\] >>> \[LV. 100\]-MAX--
    
                         —New ability unlocked (True Sight)—

But as soon as the message began to fade I felt a sharp pain, like a massive sharp spike was being twisted through my skull. I fell backward space around me began to tear apart and black voids began to swallow everything around me everything endless rows of strange green text

The next thing I knew I was standing by my bed like nothing had happened... like it had all been a dream...

Have I ever had a dream before? I wondered.

*<<<Check point reload successful!>>>*

Looking around the room everything looked slightly different like someone had moved everything around behind my back.

In the corners of my vision, I could see all these bars with strange words like

*LEVEL: 72*

*EXP: 125/10500*

*HP: 15000/15000*

*SP: 1200/2300*

*STA:200/200*

Turning around I noticed a strange semi-transparent box floating in the air with a text hanging over it ”Obj.camera.third.person” and a small window or portal.

On the other side of the portal, I could see the face of a man in a blue hood with a strange U-shaped headband that covered both his ears.

“Who are you?” I asked, resting my hand on my hilt, in my mind preparing for a battle.

“C’mon dud! It bugged!?” The strange man said, “It better have saved my progress...”

“What’s a bugged?” I asked.

“Is this a cutscene?” the man muttered, “why isn't my controller working!?”

I drew my sword and pointed it at the main in the floating portal, “Are you going to answer my questions or just ignore me intruder?”

“What are you talking to me!? How can you hear me!?” the man asked,

“You’re the one that just appeared in my room...” I pointed.

“What are you a dev!? A stream sniper?! Listen dud...” The man sighed ”I only used that exploit to do a little grinding! You didn't have to invade my game and ruin my immersion!”

“I mean you’re being weird dud... This game is like five years old and I’ve bought more them my fair share of packs and ALL the DLC. So just leave me alone alright!?”

“Listen, Sir... Obj camera man... or whatever you're called, I’m no devil and I care not for your LDC or immersion, I just want to know how you got in my room and what you want”

“C’mon dud! STOP being weird! I can not right now! you’re unbelievable! breaking the fourth wall like this... Listen, man, you’re not gonna troll me, you not gonna get a funny clip out of me, you’re just gonna look dumb!”

“So why don’t get out of my game and give me back control!?” —He groaned and ran a hand over his face "You know what frick it dud! I'm getting off for the day!"

As soon as he said that everything around me went dark...
