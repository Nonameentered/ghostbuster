Part 2

Duke pushed through the boisterous crowd, bumping shoulders with one of the men he’d been eavesdropping on early as he squeezed his way towards the front of the crowd trying to get a better look.
  

  
Everyone who watched him do this simply assumed he was another eager fanboy desperate to lay eyes on his favorite villainess in living color for the first time, and too stupid or naïve to realize she’d never look twice at him. 
  

  
And they weren't half wrong, the closest duke had ever been to seeing lady Frostbite was on the many television programs he watched that followed her many exploits. And there was no denying that Frostbite was a grade-A femme fatal. 
  

  
Villainesses have the nasty habit of being every bit alluring and attractive as they are sly and deceitful. 
  

  
 Duke tapped the button pinned to his lapel secretly taking a photo of the man currently speaking on stage. It was an infamous crime boss and owner of the mid-town lounge Yuri Alexander Gregorian AKA the polar bear. 
  

  
Yuri isn't your run of the mill baddy, for one thing, most of his business is legitimate and in a strange turn of events, he’s often been instrumental in taking down a number of lesser-known ringleaders and crime bosses, though, of course, he does personally benefit by taking out the competition. 
  

  
Yuri took to the stage wearing his classic white pinstriped suit, cleanly pressed white shirt, blue tie, and white fedora that was clearly a few sizes too small for his massive head.
  

  
Part of the reason he’ earned the name Polar Bear was his massive eight-and-a-half foot stature and his rotund physic. Even the microphone he held looked like a kids toy in his oversized hand.
  

  
Duke felt a chill run down his spine as, for a brief moment, his eyes locked with the mob boss. Unlike Frostbite, Duke and Yuri had met before. Though he carefully was disguised in his costume then.
  

  
Duke suddenly realized he was completely surrounded by enemies if he was found out how he’d been shredded to pieces by the mod! 
  

  
Being to speak, Yuri’s deep voice resonated through the makeshift auditorium so loudly the sound system seemed almost redundant
  

  
  

  
“Big mistake most criminals make is playing the bad guy all the time! This is fine and dandy until the tax man comes to take away your hard earnings! ” Yuri said, instantly gripping the attention of all those in attendance. 
  

  
“You might be able to go toe-toe with a man with the iron jaw or even escape the rat with wings that lurks in the shadows. but nobody, and I mean nobody, stands a chance against the IRS!”
  

  
The crowd nodded in agreement.
  

  
Yuri went on to explain the best way to diversify your investments, how to make your money work for you, and how to keep your assets out of the grubby hands of lawyers during litigation. 
  

  
Duke was surprised by how practical all this information was, it made him wonder why the heroes didn't provide any training like this. 
  

  
A lot of heroes operate without a secret identity, if they had applied half of Yuri’s suggestions they could still be fighting crime instead of trying to fight lawsuits.
  

  
He was so distracted by his own thoughts And so mesmerized by the presentation that he almost didn't notice the rush of frigid air that washed over the crowd.
  

  
At the back of the room, a tall woman dressed in dark blue pushed through the door flanked on either side by well-built bodyguards. Her long, flowing, snow-white hair contrasted elegantly against her dark complexion.  
  

  
A plume of ice crystal clouded the air with each of her breaths, and a trail of ice followed beneath the heals of each of her steps.
  

  
The crowd could hardly contain themselves as her dark blue lipstick curled up into a coy smile and her signature indigo jacket flowed behind her hovering just a few inches from the ground shrouded by a thick frozen mist. 
  

  
“Lady’s and gentlemen, our guest of honor has arrived! please welcome to the stage The frozen femme fetal, the ice queen the one, the only, FROSTBITE!”
  

  
“And remember one lucky devil in the audience will win the privilege of being Frostbite's personal henchmen for a whole week!”
