—\`\`\`Call Me Elsa.
  

  


For Duke, the rest of the conference flew by like a blur. He couldn't stop his eyes from darting back and forward near constantly between the presenters on the stage and the clock hanging on the wall. 
  

  
As the hands of the clock ticked closer and closer to the meeting conclusion and as the tone of finality became more and more prominent in the voices of the presenters, Duke's heart beat harder and faster in his chest!
  

  
He hadn’t felt nervous like this since his first patrol, not even when he faced Mindplex or The Sect of Shadows on his own. But he had carefully planned and prepared beforehand.
  

  
He had to, it’s the only way a powerless hero like himself could make a difference or even survive in a city filled by unequally powered superhumans with ill intentions.
  

  
But he had no time to plan anything this time. This had gotten far more interesting than he could have ever predicted. 
  

  
When He woke up this morning he’d only planned to be undercover gathering information for a few hours, then, he’d be back at home in time to watch the Yankees make it into the world series, and get those six hours of sleep his doctor’s been nagging him about.
  

  
But he couldn't let an opportunity like this slip through his fingers. In the past, he spend months on end going on stakeout after stakeout just for the chance to make the smallest break in a case he was working on. 
  

  
He knew if he played his cards right he could change the city for the better, maybe even cement himself as a real hero like Captain Critical!
  

  
Duke waited beside the stage as the event winded down and most of the people filtered out. Pretty soon only Duke, Frostbite, Yuri ‘the polar bear’ Gregorian, and a few staff members were left in the building. 
  

  
Frostbite and Yuri talk shop for a few minutes before appearing from backstage and parting ways. Yuri disappeared out the back door while Frostbite approached Duke who was leaning against the stage trying his best to look calm cool and collected. 
  

  
“There he is,” Frostbite said, “The man of the hour. I must say I’m impressed very few have ever been quick enough to dodge one of my attacks! And without any powers no less.”
  

  
“Thanks, Ms. Frostbite!” Duke said, scratching the back of his head.
  

  
“Don’t call me Ms.” Frostbite said, holding up a frost-tipped finger, “Ms. make me sound old and Frostbite is a stage name some journalist gave me I’ve never been able to kick.”—She slipped on a pair of white gloves before offering a handshake—“Call me Elsa, It might not be my real name but it’s closest we can get to normalcy with the work that we do. Just don’t confuse me with some Disney princess and we’ll get along just fine.”
  

  
Duke tried and failed miserably to hide the shell-shocked he was feeling inside, as he shook her hand. He didn’t know what he was expecting but it certainly wasn't this—She was even smiling at him!
  

  
How could The Ice Queen be so kind, considerate, and warm? The few heroes Duke met in the past had always given him the cold shoulder assuming he was trying to steal their limelight or cash in on their name recognition. 
  

  
And she’s the supervillain? 
  

  
“Here, take this,” Elsa said, reaching out with a silver card pinched between her middle and index finger, “We start tomorrow morning, this will tell you where and when to meet.” 
  

  
“Oh, thanks!” Duke said, reaching out to grab the card.
  

  
But before he could retrieve the card he felt his hand go cold as a flood of ice streamed from frostbite's hands sounding them in a think casing of ice. 
  

  
A split second later an atomic blast pummeled the ice barrier sending sharp shreds of jagged ice skittering across the warehouse floor!
  

  
“Captain Critical!” Frostbite grimaced, her warm expression instantly solidifying into the cold icy stare Duke was used to seeing. “Get out of her kid, I’ll keep you covered!”
