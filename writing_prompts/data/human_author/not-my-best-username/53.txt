Part 2 

(needs some editing but I don't have the time right now.)

The next morning I arrived on campus at the butt crack of dawn. About an hour-and-a-half before the first classes were scheduled to start and thirty minutes before any of the teachers or other staff usually showed up. 
  

  
It was a chilly morning, there was a thin veil of gray clouds blanketing the sky and a layer of thick mist hanging in the air and rolling in the wind.
  

  
I ran across the poorly maintained law, climbed over a short wall, and stealthfully slid my way into a quiet nook tucked between the main building and the gymnasium that overlooked the street and the main entrance. 
  

  
My plan was to wait for Professor Newmen to arrive, sneak in, and follow him around to see what he did when no one was looking. If he was going to do anything weird It’d be when he thought no one was looking I reasoned. 
  

  
“I gather you have eyes like me!” A whispery voice called out from just behind me.
  

  
I quickly spun around, planted my feet, and instinctively swung at whatever monster had managed to get the drop on me.
  

  
The punch glanced off the nose of a boy around my age who looked just as surprised by the punch as I was to have someone whispering in my ear in the twilight hours of the morning. 
  

  
He stumbled backward, tripping over his own feet before falling backward to the ground clutching his nose. He had short and straight dirty blond hair, huge round-rimmed glasses, and a baby face plastered with a look of shock and fear. 
  

  
“What was that for!?” he cried out!
  

  
“What are you doing creeping up on me like that!” I demanded, my hands still clenched into tight fists.
  

  
“My apologies!“ he said holding both his hand up with open palms “I didn’t mean to scare you! Honest! It’s just... this is my hiding spot!” 
  

  
He could tell by the look on my face that I wasn't buying what he was selling. “ I know why you’re here! You’ve seen it too! Right!?”
  

  
“Seen it?” I asked, “Seen what? What are you talking about!”
  

  
“All the antitypical occurrences common to this school!”—He wobbled to his feet before dusting himself off. — “The blinking lights, energy surges, strange radio frequencies, unusual astrological phenomena!” he explained speaking so quickly I could barely keep up.
  

  
“I just thought there was something off about one of the professors!” I said still trying to process all this new information. “Who are you and how do you know so much about this I asked!”
  

  
He leaned back and pushed up his glasses which seemed to glow as laughed menacingly.
  

  
“I used to look up at the night sky with hope and wonder in my eye searching for life beyond this world,” he said clearly launching into some grand speech he had prepared. “ That is until I started looking more closely to home!” —He posed dramatically— “My name is Doom Slayer679 and this is the story!”
  

  
I couldn't stop myself from bursting into a fit of laughter. “Doom Slayer-69! That's what people call you?!” I cackled.
  

  
“I’m sorry! I’m sorry!”—I tried to hold it in—“Not trying to be mean it’s just- I wasn't expecting anything like that so early in the morning! You’ve got to give me some warning next tim-” My mouth clasped shut as a strange energy filled the air. 
  

  
We both looked at each other before quickly turning to hide behind the wall poking our heads out to look out towards the street. 
  

  
Hovering above the path shrouded in fog were two great big glowing orbs bobbed up and down towards the entrance of the building.  
  

  
“What did I say!” The boy I refuse to call Doom Slayer said, “ stuff like this happens far too often at this school!”
  
 
  
As the floating orbs drew closer to the door I could make out a long shadowy silhouette around them. 
  

  
The form had long lanky arms and something flowing down at waist length. As he stepped out of the fog I saw Professor Newmen dressed in a long trench coat and wide-brimmed hat.
  

  
“That him!” I said. “The professor I was talking to you about”
  

  
“Ah!” he nodded, “Specimen 2298-4! A personal favorite of mine. You’ve got a good eye!”
