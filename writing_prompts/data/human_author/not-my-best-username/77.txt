—April 27th, even this close to midnight the streets are still crowded, filled with even more buzz and bustle now that the less savory elements are free to roam shrouded in a cloak of darkness think and murky enough to conceal their actions. 
  

  
I’m right there with them, waiting in the shadows, watching from the dark. Power hates a vacuum, especially in such a big city. Even before I took down Marquez Ortez, the notorious crime boss, I knew someone would have to take his place.
  

  
So why shouldn't it have been me? For nearly two years now I’ve been operating on both sides of the isle, moonlighting as the head of a crime family while maintaining my image as the city's protector. 
  

  
Sometimes it feels like I’m moonlighting as a hero doing more harm than good. But it's a necessary evil,  I never claimed to be a hero.
  

  
Standing on the rooftop of a decanting abandoned warehouse drenched in the rain and surrounded by the thick foggy darkness, I waited and watched as the drug buy I’d spent weeks setting up went down, knowing full well that I was just about to put a stop to it. 
  

  
Two back SUVs pulled into the parking lot, their headlight glinting off the puddles of rainwater  before stopping in front of the loading dock and honking twice. 
  

  
A gaggle of ten men, four in one car and six in the other stepped out of their vehicles wearing street clothes and wielding automatic weapons.
  

  
The men took their positions putting on full display just how much manpower they had, making it clear how bad of an idea it was to mess with them. 
  

  
Six of the men waited by the cars while another two walked to the middle of the parking lot and the last two drivers remained in their seats with the engines running and with their fingers on the trigger. 
  
 
  
One of the men walking forward carried an awful lot of my money in a black duffle bag. Money, that If things went to plan, would soon be safe in the police lockup hopefully putting me back into good graces with my contact at the PD, and getting her off my back for the time being.  
  

  
I didn't see it as a loss, more as an investment, a small price to pay to get these drugs off the streets and to put a little bit of fear into the hearts and minds of the rival gangs and thugs dumb enough to operate in my hunting grounds.
  

  
I watched patiently as eleven members of the eighth street gang stepped out of the warehouse and into the rain, armed with an absurd amount of firepower. 
  

  
Twenty-one targets to take out. I thought, they’re gonna be a rough night. 
  

  
“Look at what we got here!” one of the thugs, one of my men, said stepping into the middle of the two gangs. “I thought the Morette boys were still too scared to come out at night, too afraid of the shadows!” 
  

  
“If that freak thinks he can mess with us, he’s got another thing coming! We got more than enough to handle him!” another thug replied tapping on the magazine of his illegal modified automatic weapon. “Let’s get on with this, are we here to share ghost stories or to do business!?”
  

  
“Alright! Alright Keep your shirt on!” the first thug jabbed. “We got the cash if you got the product.”— He gestured to the thug carrying the bag of money 
  

  
With that, all the bad actors had taken their places at center stage. It was showtime! 
  

  
I leaped from the ceiling tossing half a dozen MFD’s which magnetized onto the majority of the thug's guns preventing them from firing. By the time I’d landed on top of one of the thugs knocking him out cold, most of the thighs were already in a state of panic. 
  

  
“It’s The Shadow!” one of the thugs yelled frantically trying his best to unjam his rifle and take a shot at me.
  

  
I took the gun from his hand and used it to strike him across the face knocking him to the ground.
  

  
Two down, nineteen to go!
