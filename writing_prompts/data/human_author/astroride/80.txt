##For the Shippool Lane

"Next," Tricia says. Five people walk up at the same time, and a single piece of paper is placed before her. She sighs and puts out her cigarette. "You are aware that I have to test to ensure you're a hive mind and not just trying to scam the system for the craftpool lane."

"Don't worry. We will use the regular interstellar lane like everyone else." The person up front is a tall human male with large ears. 

"Oh, that's nice. Are you the designated pilot of your group?" Tricia asks.

"No, that's Rwedx." He gestures to the Galork woman behind him. "I'm just the point person for social situations, and I'll be leading us through the question and answer phase."

"Alright, follow me." Tricia leads out of the general area and down a small hall to a room with a bee-hive symbol. The room contains one chair and a line on the floor. "Please stand on the line in a row."

The hive mind follows her instructions. "Alright, as you know we've got to do a sensory test to ensure proper connection. Do you consent to the standard test?"

The five nod their heads and clinch in preparation. Tricia walks down the line and sizes them up. When she reaches the end of the line, she turns and goes back to the start. Halfway through her second trip, she turns and slaps the human male across the face. The rest of them recoil in pain with him.

"Alright, that's adequate evidence for sensory connection." She checks the box. "Alright, I'm going to need your collective name."

"We call ourselves Hyden. My name is Jax, and I based off the Hydra in Greek-"

"I don't care why you called yourself that. I work for the DSV. If I heard everyone's stories, we'd get more complaints about being too slow. Now where was I?" Tricia looks at her clipboard. "Oh right, how long have you five been a hivemind?"

"Well, it started ten years ago between Gewn and I. Our most recent addition was Viw three years ago. We felt like we had a connection and could help-"

"Again, I don't need an autobiography. Just answer the questions." 

"Excuse me. You are an incredibly rude," a small Ewrc says.

"Loe, I think that's every member of the SMV," Jax says.

"It's true. We have a reputation to uphold. My ex-boyfriends told me the same thing." Tricia holds the clipboard to her chest. "I dated a human hive-mind once. I thought it would be fun, but they never shut up. Also, I greatly preferred one of them over the rest and caused problems. Do you all ever experience anything like that?"

"No, we generally view romance as a democratic affair."

"Did I tell you to keep talking?" Tricia asks.

"My god, why are you such an ass?" Rwedx asks.

"Sorry, I'm just cranky because Tyler is getting yelled at by someone, and I'm feeling his emotions."

"Wait, you're in a hive-mind too."

"We're more of a loose collective. Everyone at the Department of Space Vehicles is in it. The head honchos figured it would be a way to distribute the stress and boredom evenly. Instead it made us all cranky and mildly bitchy."

"I wouldn't say mildly," Loe says.

"Please everyone stop being rude. Can we just finish this process?" Jax asks.

"I already processed your application. I just need a photo." A droid flies in front of Tricia. Hyden smiles. "Don't smile you look weird." Hyden drops their grins in frustration. "That's better."
