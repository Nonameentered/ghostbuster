##Tea and Story Time

Princess Phoebe enjoyed her afternoon tea in the library. It was amazing how many books one could fit into a room, assuming one didn't want to move around very much. She had books about oceans and deserts and books that made one laugh so hard that one started to cry. Books were the fuse for a successful day.

Lord Periwinkle walked into the library and skipped through the bookshelves. In one leap, he crossed several piles of books. Phoebe clapped her hands at his marvelous dance.

“Absolutely wonderful, how do you manage to keep your vitality at your advanced age,” Phoebe said.

“I’m not that old.” Periwinkle shook his head. “I mean that I’m just a young whippersnapper at heart.”


“Would you like some tea? It’s made from starlight.” She drank deep from her cup of stars and smiled.

“Hmm, I’d rather not. I’ve heard that starlight has quite the amarulence to it,” Periwinkle said.

“Well, let’s sing a song together.” Phoebe stood and twirled.

*Dolphins on the sea.*

*Sparrows in the sky.*

*Love is with me.*

*How we fly high.*

“Uhh.” Periwinkle paused as he searched for words.

*I’m stuck on the ground.*

*There’s no one around.*

*Please come back to me.*

*Please, Phoebe come back to me.*

Periwinkle shed a tear. “I can’t lose you too.”

“What are you talking about? I’m right here.” Phoebe said.

“You’re here physically, but your mind is somewhere else.”

“What a silly statement.” Phoebe laughed. “Lord Periwinkle, my cattywampus might attack you for that. You know how he loves to eat nonsense.”

“Oscar likes tuna, and he’s even starting to worry about you. He walks into your room and sees the papers on the floor and leaves. You were always his favorite.” Periwinkle breathed. “And our name isn’t Periwinkle. It’s Paterson, and please call me dad.”

Phoebe started to cry. The towers of books around her began to fall. The table disappeared.

“But you never joined our tea parties before. So I had to give you a name. You can’t be dad here.”

“I’m sorry I did that. I thought it was a good bonding time between you and your mother. I would’ve joined if I knew that-”

“Stop it. Right now.” Cracks appeared in the walls and floor. “Queen Priscilla is coming. She’ll be here soon.”

“Phoebe.” Lord Paterson held out his hand. “I want to think the same, but it’s not going to happen.”

“No, she’ll be here. She has to be. It’s tea time, and she’d never miss tea time.” Phoebe said.

“I’m sorry, but she did.” Lord Periwinkle hugged Phoebe. The library disappeared.

A pile of papers and books on the floor replaces it. Stuffed animals and toys are buried underneath the papers. Clothes are scattered around the room. Phoebe and her dad sit on her bed.

“I can’t believe I did that. I’m twelve, not six,” Phoebe says. Oscar wanders into the room; he jumps next to Phoebe and nuzzles her. She smiles and pets him.

“It’s okay. We all handle grief differently.” Her dad wipes the tears off her face.

“Tea and story time with her was so special. I guess I just thought if I recreated it. She’d come back,” Phoebe says.

“If you want, I can make you a cup of tea every morning before school. It’ll be a special treat.”

“Can I tell you a secret,” Phoebe giggles, “I’ve never had tea. It was always pretend. It’s why I said it was made from starlight.”

“I figured. Starlight would burn your tongue. I’ll make sure to start you on a sweet tea.” Her dad stands and walks out, nearly tripping several times. “Oh, I’m sorry that I have to say this, but you should really clean your room.”

“I know dad.” Phoebe looks at the mess she made. “I know.”
