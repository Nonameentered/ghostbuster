##The Lemonade Business

"Good morning Andrew." Matteo walks close to me and starts bumping into me to demonstrate his gun. "What a lovely day."

"I agree." I take out the money.

"Woah, let's not do that here. Let's go somewhere else." He starts guiding me through the city until we reach a suburban neighborhood. On the corner of Third St. and Washington Avenue is a lemonade stand with a little girl as the attendant.

"Would you like some lemonade?" she asks.

"Uh, no thanks," I say.

"I think you should buy it, Andrew." Matteo jabs me with his gun.
"It's a hot summer day

"Uh, okay." I take out a dollar and place it on the table. She snarls at me.

"It costs one thousand dollars," she says.

"What the? But the sign says one dollar."

"There's a fee for serving bozos like you." I blink at the child several times.

"Wait a minute." I point my right hand to the two. "Is she in this?"

"I'm the frontwoman. Now hand over the money jerkface," she says.

"You heard the lady, jerkface." Matteo jabs me with the gun.

"Seriously, this is extremely irresponsible. What if the police or the Mancini family comes?" I ask.

"I'm not scared of those Mancini losers. They wouldn't dare strike at me," she laughs.

"Great job, Sofie. You're like a young Tony Soprano," Matteo says.

"Young Tony Soprano." I shake my head. "Why are you encouraging this. She should be at school. How old is she?"

"Are you the IRS?"

"Uh, no."

"The FBI?"

"No."

"My babysitter."

"What does this have to do with anything?" I hold out my arms.

"If you were any of those things, I'd tell. Since you aren't, I'm not telling you anything."

"I can't believe a six year old is sticking me up," I say.

"Hey." She puts her hands on her hips. "I'm eight."

"Ha, works every time," I say. The girl looks at Matteo with tears in her eyes.

"I'm sorry Uncle Matty. The mean man tricked me." Matteo hits me on the back of the head.

"It's okay Bella. We all make mistakes sometimes. Isn't that right Andrew?" He hits me again.

"Yep, I made a mistake. Sorry," I say.

"You can make it up to me by paying one-thousand and one-hundred dollars," she says. Matteo sticks the gun in my side. I sigh.

"Okay." I put the money on the table. She puts it in a small lock box.

"Thank you."

"What? Don't I get a lemonade?" I ask.

"No, I don't give it to meanies." She sticks out her tongue.
