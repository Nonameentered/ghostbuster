##Hiding from Violence

Bullets tear through the air. Men collapse on impact. The dirt is constantly hovering from the impacts. Shane, Evan, and John are watching the carnage from the safety of their hideout.

"Should one of us go out there?" Shane asks.

"Of course, it's glorious to die in the battle." Evan stands and places his hand over his heart.

"Then, why aren't you there?" John polishes his gun.

"I didn't say it was glorious for me to die in battle. No, it would be glorious if one of you two did it." Evan sits back down.

"No thanks, I'd rather live the rest of my life in charming little villa," Shane says.

"I always imagined myself dying under less respectable circumstances like getting kicked in the face by a horse," John says.

"If you both went out there, you'd get medals for dying in battle. While I would get a medal for being a sole survivor," Evan says.

"But we wouldn't be able to enjoy our rewards if we're dead," Shane says.

"It would go to your families."

"That would cause my uncles to fight, and I don't want to subject my mom to that," John says.

"Your uncles?" Evan asks.

"My father abandoned the family so my mom's six brothers tried to raise me. Spent more time bickering than fathering." John wipes a tear from his face. "One time, I was stuck in a well for four days because they couldn't figure out which one would get the honor of rescuing me. I grew to like that well."

"See. We're just like your uncles." Evan grabs John. "Go out there a rescue your nephew."

"Hold on. You're trying to trick him." Shane slaps Evan's hands. "Why are you so obsessed with trying to get us killed? Why can't we all wait out this little skirmish?"

"Ah, because three soldiers hiding is a bad sign. One is a coward. Two is a coward and his friend. Three is the sign of a potential rebellion," Evan says.

"I think you just want the hole for yourself," Shane replies.

"I agree," John nods.

"No, I just need a war story to regale a future companion with." Evan says. John shoots Evan in the shoulder. "What was that for?"

"You can impress the women back home with your wound. Say you got it when one of your companions went mad," John says.

"Oh my god." Evan looks at the blood. "You have gone mad. I'm dead either way." He crawls out of the hole. "I'm coming Valkyries."

"Nice job giving him motivation," Shane says. John shoots Shane. "Why'd you shoot me?"

"I wanted to make sure my gun still worked," John says.

"Wait for me!" Shane yells as he crawls out of the hole. John lies on his back.

"Now, I've got the hole all to myself." John closes his eyes. "Just like the well."
