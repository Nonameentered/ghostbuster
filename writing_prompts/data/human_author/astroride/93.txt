##Under Big Brother's Guidance

“All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” The man walks around Jack waving a knife with a smile on his face. “That’s why I had to rescue you. Big Brother told me that you’re one of our long lost siblings.”

“Dude, you’re old enough to be my father.” Jack looks around the basement for any hints about this man. The chair he’s tied to was pulled from a card table with a deck of uno cards on it. Behind the chair are four red bean bag chairs surrounding a flat screen TV with gaming consoles surrounding it. To the right of the chair is a colorful dart board with suction cup darts sticking out of it.

“I’m not old. I’ve just acquired my true face. At fifty, everyone has the face he deserves. Big Brother has taught me how to give others their true face earlier,” the man says.

“Is your Big Brother here?” 

“He’s resting upstairs. He came back from his trip to Catalonia. He exhumed three mummies there.” The man claps his hands. “I’m so happy that he taught me such an adult word.”

“Uh huh.” Jack nods his head. His life is in the hands of this Peter Pan knock-off. He may as well play along. “Will your brother bring one of them to the basement?”

“Basement.” The man shakes his whole body with his head. “This isn’t a basement; it’s a growlery. It’s where we release our inner animal. Watch.” The man emits a high-pitched roar that would be more at-home entertaining children. “Now, you try.”

“Grrr.” Jack’s attempt is disappointing, and the man holds the knife to Jack’s throat.

“Try again.” The man smiles. Jack unleashes a roar worthy of a movie. The man bounces and claps. “Good job.”


“Thank you.” Jack chuckles and taps his feet. “So do you and your older brother have names?”

“My name is Goober, and Big Brother is Big Brother. That’s all the name he’ll ever need.” Jack stares at Goober. Goober lowers his head. “You have to talk to me when I’m talking to you.”

“Sorry. I just didn’t know what to say. Uh, is Big Brother a father figure to you?” Jack asks.

“Of course not, dads teach us how to grow up. Big Brother tells us that we don’t have to grow up. We lose our youth because we tell ourselves we lose our youth. Get it,” Goober says.

“Perfectly.” Jack shakes as he struggles to think of another question. “So do we have other siblings?” 

“You just said we.” Goober gasps. “I knew you’d accept us. We have twelve brothers besides Big Brother and eleven sisters. I’m so glad you met me first. I recently had a fight with Crayon, my former best friend.” Goober crosses his arms and pouts.

“I’ll gladly be your best friend.”

“No, no.” Goober holds out his hand. “You have to meet all your siblings before making your choice. It’s the rules of Big Brother.”

“Will I ever meet Big Brother?” Jack asks. He hears a door open behind him. Goober jumps up and down.
