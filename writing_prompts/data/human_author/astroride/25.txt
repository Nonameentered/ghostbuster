##Planetary Disaster Group Chat

Marw: I've created this group chat because I don't how to describe what I'm seeing for my official report.

Ywu: What are you talking about? Earth is a level 2 planet.

Wme: Yeah, I wish I had a planet like Earth for my observation.

Jhp: Nah, you want a level 1 planet like Voew. Level 2 planets can become shitshows in the snap of a quar.

Marw: Earth is quite a mess. These people are, to put it mildly, insane. They built airplanes about a preon ago, and they are already dropping bombs on each other.

Jhp: Wow, that's a quick turnaround.

Ywu: Why are they fighting?

Marw: I don't know for sure; it's really confusing. There's a landmass called Europe that's divided into countries. One of those countries is the United Kingdom (which is really four countries, but one country in particular hates the rest. It's weird). That country is like scary powerful.

Wme: Oh, like the Ganthors?

Marw: Exactly like the Ganthors. 

Jhp: Oh no.

Marw: Yeah, there's this other country called Russia that the United Kingdom used to hate, but now they like. Another country called France that the United Kingdom used to hate, but not they like.

Wme: What a strange series of relations.

Marw: It's so bizarre. There's also this country called Germany which wasn't a country until two parmans ago. Germany's formation freaked out the United Kingdom, France, and Russia which caused them to make an alliance. Germany meanwhile aligned with Austria-Hungary which is technically ruled by Germans, but not really. Germany also joined with Italy another newly created country, but Italy decided to work the United Kingdom. I don't understand either.

Ywu: My brain hurts.

Marw: It gets weirder. There's this country called the Ottoman Empire that's been declining for four quaxis. Another country emerged from it's decline called Serbia. A lot of Serbians are in Austria-Hungary, and Serbians don't like that. So a Serbian man shot the heir to Austria-Hungary. This triggered a massive war because Russia supported the Serbians. The Ottoman Empire is also involved because why not. There are more countries involved in this such as Bulgaria and the United States a former possession of the United Kingdom. 

Wme: How do humans keep track of all this?

Marw: I don't think most of them do. And this war is scary. They invented this weapon called mustard gas. It's worse than the Yja dust. Humans are terrified of it.

Ywu: That's terrible. Why would they unleash it on an open battle?

Marw: It's not that open. They're engaged in something called trench warfare. The two armies have dug long holes in the ground and stationed their troops there. The middle is filled with barbed wire and called no man's land. The two armies shoot at each other in the hopes to break the other's spirit. Occasionally, one will charge at the other, but they'll gain a miniscule amount of land. It's horrifying. 

Jhp: That's brutal.

Marw: Also, the trenches are disgusting. I think just as many humans have died from the poor conditions in the trenches as on the battlefield. A new disease has been discovered in a country called Spain, and that disease may kill even more people.

Wme: This planet sounds like a disaster.

Marw: Exactly, how am I supposed to explain it to my supervisor?

Hwq: You don't have to.

Marw: Hello Hwq. I didn't notice that I accidentally added you to this conversation. I'm sorry for my unprofessional language.

Hwq: It's alright. This sounds like a shit show. I'll take an archive of this conversation for the record. Keep observing and hope for the best for this planet.

Marw: Yeah, I doubt things will get better from here in the immediate future.
