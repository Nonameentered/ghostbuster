[Poem]

##It was...

It was thrilling.

It was terrifying.

It made me a monster.

It made me normal.

It was when I lost all self-delusions.

It was when I was most confused.

It was what I had to do.

It was avoidable.

It was years in the making.

It was a heat of the moment decision.

It was hot with anger and violence.

It was cold with apathy to numb the effects.

It was heavily discouraged by everyone.

It was glamorized more than the other vices.

It was a moment that I will always look back at with shame.

It was a time when I felt most proud of my actions.
