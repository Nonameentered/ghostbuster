##Red Ball of Life

Blake's walking stick hits something hard in the ground, and a screech shakes the ground for several seconds. He tosses the stick to the side and bends over. A red light emits red from a crack. Moving the dirt aside, he picks up a red glass ball.

"I'd be careful if I were you." Blake jumps at the voice behind him clutching the ball close to his chest. He turns to see a man in a black cloak with a long flowing beard. His eyes are the same bright red as the ball.

"Sorry, I didn't see you there. Is this yours?" Blake hands out the ball. 

"Yes, thank you for your courtesy." The man takes the ball with a smile on his face. After cradling the ball, his smile fades. "This is not the right one."

"What do you mean?" Blake asks. The man looks up in shock. His face twists into sadness.

"You wouldn't believe me. No modern person does," he cries. Blake moves next to the man and pats his shoulder.

"I'm a huge fantasy nerd who found a glowing ball beneath my feet. I'll believe you," Blake says. The man smiles through the tears.

"If you haven't figured it out yet, I'm an ancient wizard. These balls are the remnants of magic that occur after a spell is completed. Three thousand years ago. My daughter accidentally trapped herself in one, and I've been searching for it ever since," the man says.

"That's terrible. Is there anyway I can help?"

"There is one way. It's a locator spell that taps into the power of the sun and moon and requires two people who believe in the power of magic with all their hearts." The man holds out the ball. "Take the ball. Close your eyes and believe."

"Isn't this a little clich√©?" Blake chuckles.

"Are you saying you do not believe because the vary foundations of magic have become trite? This spell is older than the written word itself. If you cannot set aside such modern notions, I will never find my daughter." Blake jumps and grabs the ball.

"Sorry. I believe. I believe." Blake chants with his eyes close. The old man smiles.

"Perfect." Red particles emerge from the ball. They surround Blake who opens his eyes.

"Wow," he says. The particles attach themselves to him. "Ow. Is it supposed to hurt?"

"Magic is pain." The particles detach from him removing bits of Blake. Blake screams as he is slowly disintegrated. The man laughs as Blake is drawn into the ball. The ball disappears into a burst of life.

"That'll give me another forty years at least if I need it. Now, if only I can find my life force." the old man shrugs. "Oh well, everyone alive nowadays wouldn't know the first thing to do with it."

The man disappears in a cloud of red smoke. Behind the smoke, a woman with glowing red eyes stands holding a red ball. She laughs as she will finally have her revenge.
