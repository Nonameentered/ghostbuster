##Genre Savvy

"Medusa, get the dolly," Euryale yells.

"I'm in the bathroom. Stheno, you do it," Medusa says.

"But I got the last one. Isn't it Euryale's turn anyway," Stheno yells back.

"You didn't get the last one. I did," Medusa replies.

"Fine, I'll get." Euryale moves to a supply closet to grab the dolly. After loading the would-be hero, she rolls him to the storage area in the back of their house. Medusa flushes and walks out of the bathroom.

"Oh gods, another cool guy," Medusa says. The statue on the dolly is a man in his mid-twenties wearing a leather jacket with no shirt. His six-pack abs had the kind of definition only achieved by dehydration and doing several sit-ups before entering. His pants are several sizes too small. The shot gun in his right arm is pointed in the air, but the safety is still on. His left-hand is placing a pair of sunglasses on his face. 

"Why do they insist on styling themselves so thoroughly if they know no one will live to tell the tale?" Euryale opens the storage door and places the statue inside. "This one even had a prepared quip. He said, 'I'm your mongoose.' Clearly, he thought that would sound cooler than it did."

"I blame modern culture for the general decline in manners." Stheno shuts the door.

"I agree. Perseus was had so much dignity when he beheaded me," Medusa says, "It was one slash and done. He didn't mock me or call me a monster at all."

"Are you sure? I remember you told me he screamed and called you hideous," Euryale says.

"Maybe. It was thousands of years ago. I really only remember what the legends say, and those legends never concerned themselves with how the hero looked or what he said," Medusa says.

"It's true, and the heroes didn't go out of their way to show us how smart they were. Or how 'genre-savvy.'" Stheno puts the phrase in air-quotes. "Their generation was."

"There've been worse times. Remember those centuries where the only people that tried to slay us were monks," Euryale says.

"Oh, how could I forgot. They kept saying we were possessed by the devil." Medusa grabs the snakes in her hair. "A few kept insulting me by saying it was the mark of the beast."

"I actually liked the monks. When I asked a few questions about the outside world, they would launch into lectures. I learned so much," Stheno says.

"That's what the internet is for now, but you're right. There is something more romantic about receiving calculus instructions from a man throwing holy water at you." Euryale snaps her fingers as she remembers her question. "Oh right, our statue is closet is getting full. Do we have any buyers lined up or should we start turning them into gravel?"

"I already have several buyers lined up." Stheno strikes a pose. "I will say I appreciate how business is done in the modern world. We would've never made this much profit in the Hellenistic world."

"Agreed, the heroes are gone, and the businessmen replaced them." Euryale says.

"I do miss a good here." Medusa rubs her neck where she was decapitated. 

"Me too."

"Me as well." The three women sigh and continue to reminisce.
