##The Other Side of the Call

"So you're saying in your universe pigs do fly?" I ask.

"Yep," Jack-8134 replies. When Uncle Alex gave me this phone, he told me it was to help learn new skills from other universes. I've mostly been using it when I'm bored. He probably expected that. 

"So what do you say when you want to indicate something is impossible?"

"When bats fly."

"Bats don't fly on your universe; how do they get their pray?" 

"A horde of them usually tackles someone to the ground, and then, they drink the victim's blood." I pull face away from the phone, and my jaw drops.

"That sounds terrifying."

"It isasikva." The phone stutters as connection to Universe-8134 is lost. I sigh.

The interdimensional cellphone works like a normal cellphone, meaning that I have to hold on in the air for a signal. Unlike other cellphones, I can't switch carriers or providers. I have to hope for the best. After holding it in the air for five minutes, the static clears from the device.

"Snarkle Snap." The cellphone requires a few seconds to properly translate interdimensional speech. The screen says that the signal comes from Universe-1092156. I've never contacted a universe that fare from my own. Uncle Alex will be interested.

"Hello, can you understand me?" I ask.

"Wjawk Quenkz," Jack-1092156 replies.

"I'm just contacting you for a friendly chat," I say.

"Sorry for the stammering. I was eating," Jack-1092156 says in a slightly deeper voice than mine.

"It's okay. What do people eat on your Earth?"

"Other humans." I pause for several seconds then chuckle.

"That's a good joke."

"It wasn't a joke. Do you not have unevolved humans on your Earth?"

"What do you mean unevolved humans?" My amusement turns to fear.

"In my universe, some humans have evolved into a more advanced state. Unfortunately, we require nutrients that only the unevolved can provide," he says.

"That's bizarre. How is cannibalism tolerated on your Earth?"

"Because it's necessary." Jack-1092156 is speaking to me like I'm a child. "Those unevolved fleshbags protest too, but they're opinions don't matter. The evolved are superior in every way."

"Fleshbags? Are you a robot or something?" Jack-1092156 laughs.

"You have no idea. Do you?" Uncle Alex bursts into my room. He picks up the phone and hangs up.

"What the hell was that?" I ask.

"A few hours ago, I came into contact with Universe-1092156. That's how you were able to call them on your cellphone." He shakes his head. "I stayed on the line for too long as well."

"What's going on?"

"They're monsters over there, and they want a new food source."

"Are they coming here?" I pull back in fear. Uncle Alex nods his head.

"And we led them right to us."
