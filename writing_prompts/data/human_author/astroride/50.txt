##Scarecrows Summit

Alyssa slips out of her parent's house with several bottles of beer in her jacket. Dave's last message was several heart eye emojis; teenage boys aren't known for subtlety. She runs into the night clutching her jacket. The cold is already making her teeth chatter, but starting the car would draw attention. Besides, the party is only ten minutes away by foot.

After five minutes of walking, she sees a light in the woods to the right of her. She thought it was further, but she could've been wrong. As she approaches the fire, she hears voices that she doesn't recognize. Within a few feet, she sees the meeting.

Four figures stand around a fire in overalls and plaid shirts with old hats. They are completely still while they talk. Clumps of hay stick out of their bodies. Alyssa crouches down and hides. This has to be some weird joke or for a video.

"Harold, you were lying when you said that gasoline scares off the crows. All it did was confuse the McMullins."

"Maybe you didn't do it right, Frank."

"Are you sure you won't sabotaging our farm on behalf of the Grants?"

"Harold, you can't just go around accusing each other of that. We have rules here."

"Sorry, Daniel."

Alyssa watches the body stand by the fire. Occasionally, the wind will blow hay out of them, but they won't move. She pulls out her camera to record this scene.

"I still say we should organize. We are out here working for free."

"You know the humans would freak out if they found out we were alive."

"Besides, what would we do with the money. It's not like we can eat."

"I don't know. I'd like to see a movie in the theater."

"You can do that, but peering through their window."

"Well, it gets cold sometimes."

"You don't feel temperatures."

Alyssa tries to figure out whose talking, but the scarecrows give no indication. She tries to remember the scarecrows that belong to certain families, but her mind is blank. 

"Well, what about a car? I want a car."

"That sounds nice. I want one too."

"What would you do with a car? Our feet couldn't press on the brakes you alfalfa filled asshole."

Alyssa can't help, but giggle at that remark. She puts her hand over her mouth, but accidentally falls on her back.

"Crap, someone's here."

Alyssa sits up to view the scarecrows, but they're gone. When she turns around, four figures are staring at her.

The buzzing of Alyssa's phone wakes her. She's lying in her bed. When she checks it, she sees ten messages from Dave about the party, each increasing in desperation. She quickly types a message about accidentally falling asleep before putting her head on her pillow.

Something tickles her right ear. She reaches up to grab it and pulls out a piece of hay.
