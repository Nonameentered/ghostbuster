##Join the Horde

It's been three weeks since we last saw the sun. The drones have consumed the forests and the mountains, and the ocean is three quarters drained. Current estimates of human life remaining is in the hundred millions, but that is optimistic. 

The drones appear to be normal insects until viewed close. Their skin is silver and coated in a frost. Unlike Earth bees, their mouths are the majority of their abdomen. A nozzle on their mouth releases a gas that floats to the sky. Satellite images show a large hive where the moon used to be that probably collects the gas.

When they first arrived, some fools tried to swat them. They were quickly destroyed. The people that fired guns randomly in panic were killed soon after. Military planes and bombs were useless against them. The entire nuclear arsenal of the world was consumed in under three seconds. All we have left is to ignore them until our time comes.

That was what my plan until a cluster of drones started hovering before me. There must be a thousand drones constantly moving and expanding in a random pattern. I thought it was going to consume me so I stood still. It hasn't done anything for the past two hours.

"Would you like a can of beans? Sorry it's not much, but everything else is gone." I cringe after that statement. It's so banal, but how am I supposed to greet a horseman of the apocalypse?

"Our physical needs are met." The sound comes from across the cluster. It speaks as a chorus of voices some sound human. "We require information."

"Information? Uh, I think you've already ate the leaders of the world," I giggle nervously, "I suppose you could read some old books or download data off of servers. If you can do that, I'm still sure what you can do."

"Factual data on this planet and the organisms has been collected. We understand your civilizations better than you ever could." The last line clearly has a more human voices than the rest.

"Then, why do you need me? I'm just a thirty-year old service desk worker without a girlfriend. I think you could do better."

"By contrast, your mediocrity is the your most desirable characteristic. When we leave a planet, we assimilate a portion of its inhabitants before moving to the next world. One-thousand three-hundred and twenty-six humans have already been assimilated," the cluster pauses, "They are adjusting well." I hear the humans in the last sentence again.

"So you want me to join you. What if I don't want to fly around destroying planets?"

"We do not merely destroy planets." The humans take over. "Our role in preserving the universe is vital. We can expose you to the secrets of reality. The knowledge of Earth is merely a drop in the oceans of our understanding." The voices fade and one voice speaks out. "You will become a part of something bigger."

I bite my lip. They are clearly manipulating me to join, but they could clearly move on without me. A majority of humans would jump at the chance to survive the apocalypse. Why am I hesitating?

Because I know if I join it, I would lose my humanity. Tyler Jones is a human through and through, and I belong on Earth even as its dying. This weird horde may have a larger purpose, but it's not my purpose. We make our own destiny, and mine is to die with my planet.

"I'm sorry. I can't join you," I reply.

"We understand." The drones scatter and cover my skin. I close my eyes and accept my fate.
