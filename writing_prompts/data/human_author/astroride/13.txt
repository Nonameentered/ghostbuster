##From Time Itself

Rachel scours her mother Brenda's lab. Her phone is on silent; everyone is trying to get in her good graces for a chance at the time machine. The lab is in a rare state of chaos. Before she died, Brenda impeded everyone from being able to find her work by making a giant mess. With how organized she was, Rachel hopes creating a mess was cathartic for her.

Under several stacks of paper, Rachel spots a small journal. Brenda was always old-fashioned in that regard. Rachel removes the papers to view the journal. 

*Rachel,*

*Before I begin, I want you to know that I love you. You were my motivation for discovering the secrets of the universe because I wanted a better life for you.*

Rachel wipes a tear from her face.

*As you know, I discovered time travel before my death. I can only predict why you're looking through my notes be it the rationale for my actions or frankly to sell my research to someone. Either way, this note will act as a guide to my final days. It all started with an apple.*

Rachel rolls her eyes and looks in the trash. That apple smelled awful and stained the desk. Why was her mom so obsessed with that stupid Newton story.

*The apple was the first organism to time travel two weeks ago. On Wednesday, I sent it to my past self on Tuesday. On Tuesday, I sent it to my future self on Thursday. For five hours, I had two of the same apples on my desk. I ran as many tests as I could on both apples, but I noticed little changes in the environment or in the organism. I figured it must be safe for me to travel. So I went back to see the dinosaurs.*

Rachel shakes her head. Her mother was such a child sometimes.

*I didn't see the dinosaurs. Instead, I saw the essence of reality, and it scared me. If the apple could talk, it would've screamed in terror.*

Rachel turns around as the hairs on the back of her neck stand. A strange noise in the room that she can't quite make out.

*There are creatures that live in the timestream. When I first saw them, I knew they were evil. They grabbed me. They scratched at my psyche. The worse was the screams. The screams made me feel like my internal organs were falling apart.*

Rachel rubs her chest. She thought it was just heartburn.

*I quickly abandoned my attempt to see the dinosaurs and returned to my lab. They followed me. I destroyed the time machine, but they had already been unleashed onto the world. Onto me.*

Rachel scans the room for the creatures, but she sees nothing. Her head starts to ache. Something is clawing inside her head.

*They took great pains in torturing me day and night. It was worse than anything a human could imagine. I know I'll day soon. I want you to know that they are my killers. I pray they spare you. I pray they spare us all.*

Rachel drops the note as her the pain inside her head increases. She grabs the trashcan and vomits. Her ears ring, and she loses balance. Every step is a struggle, but she manages to leave her mom's lab. The pain stays with her when she leaves. Rachel looks outside for her tormentors, but she knows she won't see them. Her mother was the only one granted that misfortune. Rachel will have to live with the torment until she dies.
