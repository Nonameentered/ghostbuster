##Purple Door of Necessity

*It goes wherever it's needed.*

---

Jim cries in his bedroom alone. Same as every night for the past twenty years. All he wants is a friend. When he looks up, he sees the answer to his problem.

---

*It welcomes all to its warmth.*

---

Bills are spread across the table, and Lindsay got fired from her second job. The world seems to be crumbling around her. A weight in her pocket keeps her grounded and guides her.

---

*Time and distance are not restraints.*

---

The plague bodies pile in the town square. With how everyone else is doing, Mary knows that she will be the only survivor. Who would take her in? She can't live on her own.

The purple door calls to her, but she hesitates. This could be the devil playing tricks on her. This door could've curse the town, but what choice does she have. She puts the key into the door and turns it. 

---

*Hope is always on the other side.*

---

"Woah." Jim accidentally opens the door on a woman who falls.

"Oh god, I'm so sorry." Jim helps her up. She smiles at him.

"It's okay. We had to meet at some point." She brushes herself off and holds out a hand. "I'm Emily."

"Jim."

---

*No offering is necessary.*

---

The coats fell off the rack in the closet. Lindsay picks them up and finds a lock-box at the bottom. Her name is written on it in her mother's handwriting. She opens the box and finds a stack of one-hundreds inside with a note.

"Sorry I couldn't give you more."

---

*All that's needed is hope.*

---

Mary enters the house of the town doctor. He swore he could find a cure before he would pass from the disease himself. He was wrong, or was he?

At the table, Mary finds jars of ingredients and a recipe. Maybe he died before he could use it. She hears coughing outside. Looking back to the recipe, she realizes it's the only hope they have.

---

*The Purple Door of Necessity will always be there.*
