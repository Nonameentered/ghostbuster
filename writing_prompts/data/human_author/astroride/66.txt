##A Father's Warning

Thomas and Marie walk to Thomas’s car holding hands. After they enter the car, Thomas leans to kiss Marie. Before he can reach her, there is a tap on the window. He turns to see her father standing at the window. 

“Yes, Mr. Nadel?” Thomas asks.

“Promise you’ll go straight to the movie theater and straight home. I read a news story about a homicidal maniac loose in the neighborhood,” he says.

“Does he have a hook hand?” Thomas smiles, but Mr. Nadel glares back, “Alright, I’ll have her back immediately after the movie.”


Thomas starts the car and drives away from Marie’s house. Mr. Nadel stands in the driveway.

“Did he really think that stupid story would work? It’s been retold a million times by this point.” Thomas places a hand in Marie’s lap. “I remember my dad told me he knew the first victim, but I doubt it. No one remembers when it started.”

“He wants me to be secure.” Marie rolls her eyes and scoffs. “But it often crosses the line into smothering.”

“Is your mom like that too?” 

“Oh god yes. She’s always telling me about something she read online or heard from her friends. Who cares if it’s true or not. It’s only confirmation that the two of them must lock me inside my room and be the sole holders of the keys.” Marie rubs her temples. “They think they know what’s best for me, but can’t I just be a teenager?”

“Let’s do that right now.” Thomas smiles and turns left when he should’ve turned right.

“Thomas, what are you doing?” Marie asks.

“We’re going to a secluded spot to make-out.”

“My parents will kill you if they find out.” Marie puts her hand over her mouth.

“We’ll keep an eye on the clock and read the synopsis for the movie later.” Thomas drives into a park and pulls to the side of the road. He looks at her. “I understand that you’re afraid. If you want, I can turn around, and we can see the movie.”

“No.” Marie puts her arm on his shoulder. “Let’s go to the back seat.”

The two move to the center of the backseat, and Thomas wraps his arms around her. A pair of headlights drives past briefly blinding Marie. She pulls back.

“What’s wrong?” Thomas asks.

“Nothing, just a little paranoid.”

“Maybe it’s the homicidal maniac.” Thomas smirks, but Marie doesn’t laugh. “Sorry.”

Thomas embraces Marie and starts kissing her again when a branch cracks nearby. Marie jerks her head up.

“What was that?” she asks.

“Are you really letting that story get to you? You literally said that your parents believe everything they hear.”

“But what if this time they’re right?” Marie grips Thomas’s collar.

“Trust me they’re not.” He rubs her back. “It’s going to be okay. He said that to scare us into obedience.”

“I…I…” Marie inhales slowly several times. “I know what you’re saying. I guess I’m freaking out. This is the first time I’ve disobeyed them.”

“It’s alright. We’ll take it slow. I want to make sure you’re comfortable and happy.” Thomas soothes Marie until something taps on the window. Marie screams.

“It's outside!” She pushes Thomas away and curls up in a ball. 

“Hey, it’s probably a branch.” Thomas holds out his palms.

“No, it’s worse. It’s so much worse.” Marie starts to cry. “My parents were right.”

“Marie, you can’t let them control you like this,” Thomas sighs, “But if it’ll help, I can go outside to check.”

“Be careful.” Marie stutters. Thomas opens up the car and steps one foot outside. A hand reaches out and grabs him by the neck. It tosses him out of the car and onto the road. Marie screams, and Thomas looks up at his assailant.

“I told you a homicidal maniac was loose in the neighborhood.” Mr. Nadel walks towards Thomas.

“It was only a small detour. I promise that we’re going to the movies.” Thomas shuffles away on his back.

“Stop lying to me. I knew you were no good when I first saw you,” Mr. Nadel holds up a hand with a hook in it.

“I should’ve listened. I should’ve listened. I should’ve listened.” Marie rocks back and forth in the car.

“And now you’ve gone and hurt my daughter. I’m going to make sure that never happens again.” Mr. Nadel brings the hook down on Thomas.
