##Cute

Cute. Oh how I wish they would call me that. The cute dogs get treats for existing. Me, I have to work for my keep.

Grant's alarm goes off, and he presses snooze. It's my job to lick his hand until he wakes up. He smiles when he sees me. Five years ago, he was the one who picked me out of the kennel. That was mostly because he was an edgy eleven year-old who deliberately picked the ugly dog. After all these years, he still likes me.

When he is out of bed, I run to Mary's room. She is applying her make-up. When she sees me, she's so started that she smears her lipstick. She turns and runs at me.

"Stay out of my room, Hapsburg." She yells and slams the door. She'll probably never like me. It's okay because it makes it easy to screw with her. I just wish that Grant hadn't been learning about the Hapsburgs when he named it. It is such an inappropriate name for a dog.

I run downstairs where Linda is making breakfast. I can't just sit by my bowl for her to feed me so I bark at her.

"One second Hapsburg." I keep barking. She can't ignore me forever.

"Alright." She grabs dog food and puts it in my dish. As I eat it, Ben walks in the room. He grabs the ball and tosses it at me. I look up at him.

"Bring it back, boy." I tilt my head at him. Why must he insist on doing this? Why can't he buy a new car like a normal person suffering a mid-life crisis? I go back to eating my food. "Oh, I see."

When I'm done, I go to my cage to sit. Ben tosses the ball at me again, but I ignore him. He grabs another toy and puts peanut butter on it. Sucker.

After bringing it back, he laughs and calls me a good boy. Grant takes Mary to school. He gives me one pet on the way out. Ben and Linda go to work. 

When they come back, Grant will feed me. Then, I will hang out in his room. None of them called me cute. Why can't I be called cute just once? Just once.
