##Images from a Massacre

I am a camera with its shutter open, quite passive, recording, not thinking. I’m the best soldier in the regiment. I always stay in formation. I always obey orders to the letter. Which is why everything that has happened to me today has been amazing and surprising.

At 0500, General Cornwall informed us that Captain Eli had been given a sojourn from military life. Cornwall didn’t say it, but that holiday will likely turn into a permanent dismissal. The dismissal will become an execution. Cornwall requested that I take over the unit until Eli’s replacement arrived. 

My unit had the most desirable task in the military during this never ending war. We marched through the streets of cities throughout the country. It was a show of strength and a warning to our enemies internal and external. There were rumors of a rebellion occurring during a march. No one had ever been so bold to attempt that, especially a fellow soldier.

Richard, my younger brother, was a depressing sight. He was homesick for everywhere but here. He spent the days dreaming of a time when our people were at peace. A rebel group would’ve recruited him if he hadn’t decided that rebellion was hopeless. The military offered the least objectionable life in the world, and that was enough for him.

Before drills today, I caught him staring at a sundial in the park. His eyes were focused and drained of life. I wondered how long he spent watching the shadow move, but there weren’t better ways to occupy ourselves. When I reached out to him, his mouth opened.

“We used to live here,” he said. I looked beyond the park to see a familiar house.

“Yes, when we were children, we moved to Lead Mine A4 when I was five. I’m surprised you remember this place,” I replied.

“This park was the last place I felt happy,” Richard said.

“You were an infant. Everyone is happy then. Come. We have to march.” Richard followed me without hesitation, but I saw him catch one last look at the sundial.

Citizens lined across the street staring in awe at our might. Our organization and power sent goosebumps down the spine of loyal patriots. A lone woman with scars on her face stepped out of the crowd before us and held up a picture of a young man. 

“This is my son.” Her presence implicitly commanded me to stop and listen. The rest of the unit followed suit. “You took him from me five years ago. I haven’t heard from him since. For all intents and purposes, he’s dead.”

Whispers were sent through the crowd. People were sharing their experiences, and their anger was growing.

“My husband was sent to work in a factory ten years ago. You had the decency to tell me when he died a year later. Why must you rule our lives?” The whispers grew into shouts and insults.

“I demand my freedom. We will not be controlled.” Richard stepped out of formation. The woman braced herself for an attack, but he instead walked beside her.

“She speaks the truth.” His words lit the spark. Objects and rocks were thrown at us. People began closing in on us. Richard walked towards me and held out his hands. I wasn’t going to disobey an order.

Pointing my gun at his abdomen, I fired three shots. I watched as his face filled with sadness. The sadness disappeared when he fell to the ground. The rest of the unit formed a protective circle and fired on all sides. The crowd quickly dispersed as more corpses filled the streets. The woman who started the riot fell by my hand.

Flashing red lights and sirens filled the air. In theory, they were to treat the injured. In practice, they were going to clear the streets and make sure none of the rioters lived. Staring at my brother’s shocked face, I feel nothing. This was a man that I was supposed to love for my entire life yet I couldn’t find any emotion for him. Perhaps I lost them long ago when I was removed from my home. Yes, that was the answer. To find my emotions, I needed to go to the only place where I felt happy. 

I turned away from the flashing red lights and hurried to my house.
