##It Came From the Laptop

Jason sits up in his bed working on his laptop. A client needs their servers updated, and an error is causing him to be up at midnight ruining his Friday. A ping on his laptop breaks his boredom and frustration. It’s an email with the subject line “outside” with no email address.

*Hello, Jason. I’ve really enjoyed watching you work for the past sixteen hours, but you need a break. Perhaps I could help.*

Jason’s eyes widen, and he aggressively checks the security cameras. They all reveal no would-be intruders standing outside the door. He begins to relax feeling that it’s a stupid prank when he receives another email. This time the subject line is “knock.”

 
*Did you think that I’d be standing outside your door on such a caliginous night? I don’t need to stand by the windows to see you. I can see through all solid objects. I can see through you too.*

Panic takes over, and Jason grabs his phone to call the police. The phone screen is black, and it won’t turn on. He plugs it into the wall to charge it. After a few moments, it lights up with a text message from an unknown number.

*I’m closer to you now.*

The lights outside his bedroom flicker on and off. The vents blow freezing air into the room. He receives another text.

*I breached your home long ago. The safety you hold sacred is gone.*

Jason grabs the covers and pulls them close. Partially to fight against the cold and partially to satisfy the basic instinct to cover yourself in times of fear. He grabs a bat that he’s always had by the bed. In the right situation, we are all capable of the most terrible crimes. He is ready to defend himself. The speakers in his house emit a robotic laugh and start to talk.

*That is not enough to stop me.*

The room begins to fog. Through the fog, a silhouette emerges. It reaches out a hand toward Jason who swings his back against him. The fog breaks, but the figure presses onward. Static forms across Jason’s shirt and pulls him closer. Through the fog, Jason sees a large smile. The mouth opens and lunges at Jason.
