##Answers in the Past

Crumbled pillars surround me. The floor is uneven and filled with cracks. I step on a stone, and it collapses beneath me. I leap back before it falls to the cavern below. Peering in the hole, the ground is too far for comfort.

Putting as little pressure on my feet, I walk to the altar on the edge of the cliff. A single scroll sits on top of it clean of cobwebs and dust; legend states that it is too pure to be sullied. The kingdom is in tatters, and the knowledge it contains will surely help it.

When I place a hand on it, I feel it ignite a spark inside of me. The world around me is revealing it's secrets. It is as if I am viewing it from the perspective of the moon and the sun. Removing it from the altar sends thunder through the ground. I open the scroll holding my breath in anticipation of its majesty.

The interior is blank. I turn it around expecting to find text, but I find none. I rotate it rapidly in my hands hoping to find a single word, but the parchment is barren. 

"No." I toss the scroll to the side and weep at the altar. "How could this be?" 

I look at this once great temple. The knowledge and majesty that it once possessed is no more. It will be destroyed when the cliff falls into the ocean. The key to our survival will not be found here.

Yet maybe here there is wisdom. I wipe tears from my face and stand. Perhaps we should respect and honor the civilizations that came before and look to the future. We can seek inspiration from the past yet not be bound to it. 

I smile to myself. Yes, I will tell them that this is the wisdom that I found. We will survive these hardships and thrive.
