##Off-Shoots of Earth

Franklin swims through the hall looking at us with disdain in his eyes. A few hydromen look at him in awe. I put on a forced smile before he reaches me.

"Greetings ambassador, my name is John, and I'll-"

"That's a surprisingly human name." He tries to stabilize with his feet, but the halls are uneven at the base.

"I don't understand," I reply.

"Well, I thought you'd have names like bubbles or coral," he says.

"Hahaha, common misconception." I force myself to laugh at his joke. "Naming conventions are generally inherited from our human ancestors. A few have been inspired by our new planet though. Like my sister who's name is Dolwa."

"Well, I'm glad to see one thing you got from us stuck around." He laughs and wags his tail at his own joke. If he wasn't so important, I'd point out that the Earth humans before the dispersion didn't have tails, and they had five fingers. Maybe I'd mention that we have twenty-three chromosomes like they did, and modern Earth humans only have nineteen. But alas, he'd probably accuse me of spewing nonsense.

"I'm sure you'll find that we have more in common. Please come into my office." We swim into my pod. A chair sits opposite a bubble. Franklin takes the chair while I take the bubble. "As you are well-aware, Earth and Vetauri are close trading partners. I believe if this cultural exchange is successful we can become-"

"We're your close trading partner. We've got better partners like Titan," Franklin says. I quickly skimmed my notes. Earth and Titan were close partners, but there's recently been a dispute over Mars. I have to avoid looking foolish.

"Of course, we wouldn't think of taking Titan's place, but a close alliance can only be mutual beneficial for both of us."

"I suppose you're right." Franklin leans back in his chair. "Sorry I've been so prickly. I'm having trouble adjusting to the gravity and being surrounded by water."

"Understandable, has the air room provided been helpful at all?" I ask.

"It has." Franklin stands and slips. "Can we continue this another time? I need more time to adjust."

"Of course." Franklin swims away from me and closes the door. I rub my fins to my face. I would've been happy to reschedule the meeting; it's a common courtesy. Earth ambassadors always insist that they can adapt faster than anyone else. After all, they're the originals. We're all the cheap knock-offs.

I scan the files on Earth again. The dispute over Mars occurred because Martians were sick of being told they were lesser Earthlings. Most biologists agree that Martians are the closest post-dispersion species to the original humans. I shake my head. Earth will have to recognize the other species eventually whether they will come to that conclusion of their own volition or be forced to accept it remains to be seen.
