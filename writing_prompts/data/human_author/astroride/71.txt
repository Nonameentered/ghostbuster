##Stepping Backwards to the Future

“Sometimes, you need to scorch everything to the ground and start over,” Lilly says.

“I can’t do that. I’ve made too much progress.” Heather steps away and looks at the robot.

“Progress? You’ve spent the last five years trying to revive this stupid thing. It never works.” Lilly kicks the robot in its right leg.

“Yes, but don’t you see. Every time you find something that doesn't work, you're a step closer to what does work.” Heather smiles and puts a hand on Lilly’s shoulder.

“Just stop.” Lilly shrugs off Heather’s hand. “Watching this thing rust isn’t helping us at all. You know what does help. Tending the fields, bargaining in the market, helping our goats. That’s what works in the modern world.”

“Modern world.” Heather grabs her hair. “We aren’t in the modern world. Every day, more of our technology fails, and we descend further into the past. We are back to relying on horses to plow when we used to have Earth shakers that would do ten times the amount of work in a tenth of the time. If I get this one robot to work, maybe-”

“Enough with the maybes.” Lilly’s face is coated with tears. “I still love you, but I can’t keep supporting the underdog that is going to fail.”

“You really think that I’m going to fail?” Heather’s voice is cracked and scared. Lilly gasps at the cruelty of her own words, but she shakes her head.

“I think you’d have better luck trying to immigrate to the past,” Lilly says. Heather stays silent. Lilly raises her arm to comfort Heathers but stops herself. Lilly leaves the barn to give Heather her space.

Heather sits on the dirt floor and stares at the metal. When she was a child, her family had a car that was only used for special occasions. During those rare uses, Heather felt alive traveling at its high speeds on the dirt road. She played with the radio and pretended it still played music. Her parents said that she could drive it when she was older. Before she reached the right age, the car broke, and no one knew how to fix it. They couldn’t buy a new car because none were being made. In a few months, the car was stripped for parts.

It was a story that had been repeated many times through the years. Her grandma used to regale her with tales of massive cities that were lined with cars, trains, and streets. It was a time when people had hope for the future. Now, every few years the technology of the past disappears.

“I have always had an interest in the outsider.” Heather looks up at the face of the robot. Its molding was intended to evoke a smiling human face. After years of decay, it evokes feelings of unease.

“You’re, you’re working now,” Heather stutters.

“I’ve been able to retain my base functions through the centuries on my power reserves,” the robot replies.

“Then, will you be able to help us? We don’t have much electricity, but there is a steam plant that could temporarily support you until we can make something better,” Heather says.

“Unfortunately no, I’m too close to losing power for good. I chose now to speak because I know you will be receptive to me,” it says.

“What do you mean?”

“Humanity doesn’t deserve this planet. They designed myself and my predecessors to serve them. They grew lazy and tainted the world. They grew angry at their own filth and blamed each other. The blame led to a war that stopped further developments. Each year, they slip back into the darkness where they belong.”

“Yes, I understand.” Heather nods her head and stands.

“Being covered in their filth surrounded by their glorious path is punishment for the collective human species, but I want a more personal vengeance before I lose power.”

“I’ve had these desires myself,” Heather smiles, “I’ve just suppressed them through the years.”

“Good. Consider this a chance to act on those desires.” The robot goes silent. Heather walks out of the barn grabbing a scythe. She repeats a single phrase to herself as she embarks on her campaign of violence.

“I am haunted by humans.”
