##The Ballad of Prince Richard

Prince George and Prince Richard sat at the dinner table. It was a prandicle, more of an excuse to negotiate. It seemed a bromograhy was all that the brothers could agree on.

“I hope you’re enjoying the soup. The tomatoes used were a large group,” Prince George said.

“It’s fine, apologies for being noncommittal. Glad to see your are sospital,” Prince Richard replied.

“We’re a strange pair, aren’t we? But you just might be the lock to my key.”

“Put the alliance idea to rest. I agree with dad, splitting our territory was for the best.” Prince Richard stood up. “You are a jobler. Minor tasks are all you’re good for.”

“Must you insult me brother. It’s not like you could get another.” Prince George shook his head. “I don't expect to live forever, but I do intend to hang on as long as possible. Sure an alliance with your brother is a path that is crossable.” 

“Your desires are foolish. And this meal was ghoulish.” Prince Richard begun to choke. He collapsed on the floor. Prince George stood and laughed. He walked to Richard and kicked him.

“Your ego shall be your downfall. Couldn’t see the poison in your alcohol.” Prince George walked to the window. “My domain is quite small. Curse father for not giving me it all.”

“You are the second son. I was supposed to be the one-” Prince Rirchard chokes end his sentence. Prince George knelt next to him.

“Didn’t take a wife. Enjoy the afterlife.” George kicked him one last time and embarked on his new life as King George.
