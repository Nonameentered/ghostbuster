##Whirlwind of Despair

“It’s going to be fine.” Evan held Bella close. “Is there anything I can do to relieve your distress?”

“I don’t think so. I’ve lived here for a year, and I still get nervous whenever I hear that siren,” Bella replied.

“We’ll be fine. Why do you think most houses in the midwest have a basement anyway?” Evan asked.

Bella sat in the empty lot where her house once stood. Her left arm was still numb from the lamp that hit it. A gentle breeze stroked the grass around her. Memories carried on the wind fill her mind with happier times: Evan dancing with her in the kitchen, Bella getting up early to make omelets, and Bella falling asleep in his arms. How she wished those times could last.

The wind gained strength and tore at her mind. The famelicious beast won’t stop until it consumed Bella completely. Bella hugged herself to keep the reflections close. She could hear Evan shout at her over the wind. Don’t part with your illusions; it’s all you have left.

“Oh my god!” Bella shouted through the dust on her face. The rubble of the kitchen was sprawled across the basement. Evan lied under a piece of the floor and two kitchen chairs. 
Bella ran to him and cried. Evan tried to keep his eyes open and rubbed her face. Blood coated his fingers. Bella didn’t know if it was from him or her. 

“I love you,” he stammers.

“Save your strength.” Bella pulled out her phone to call for help. “Someone will be here soon.”

Sirens were already in the distance to help other people.

“I didn’t know how much I loved my garden gnomes until I saw them fly through the air, but there was nothing I could do. They were at the mercy of the currents.” Grace wiped a tear from her face. “We all were.” 

“Thank you for sharing,” Vance said.

“Seriously?” Bella said, “They’re freaking garden gnomes.”

“Bella, please don’t do that. Everyone lost a lot in that tornado,” Vance replied.

“The first gnome to break was an heirloom from my grandma who died two years ago.” Grace clenched her fist. “Does that make it sad enough for your standards?”

“Grace, please.” Vance held up his arms. “We are all clearly still processing that horrible day. We’ll all be better if we work together.”

Bella rolled her eyes. Vance was right, but Bella didn’t think she could ever get over what happened to her.

“Take my hand.” Evan shouted. The roar of the tornado overwhelmed everything. Windows shattered, and glass collected in the eddy surrounding the house.

 “I don’t think we’ll make it!” Bella yelled back. The wind from outside the house blew inward creating  a small pile in the middle of the room.

“Trust me. We will.” Evan shouted as the floor above him started to crack.

---

Bella clutched at the pillow and imagined it was Evan. The motel room smelled like cigarettes and febreze. When she closed her eyes, she thought of all the places that she could move to. Without Evan, there was no point in staying where she was.

But where could she go where she wouldn’t be reminded of him. The wind would certainly carry his voice wherever she went, and she would still panic whenever a gust got too strong. In the end, she would have to make due with the wreckage of her former life.
