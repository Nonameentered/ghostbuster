##Regal Boundary

"What is that child doing?" Harold shouts. A child runs to throne and sits on it. He starts giggling. "Off with his head."

"Sire, we're dead. You can't order the living to carry out your desires," Gerald says.

"Then, why is that lady retrieving him?" Harold asks.

"Because that's his mother, and he stepped past the velvet rope," Gerald says.

"Hmm, what is this rope of velvet?" Harold bends over and inspects the red barrier between the rest of the great hall and the throne.

"It's meant to keep people from damaging the artifacts."

"Bah, my royal presence is enough." Harold walks through the rope and sits on the throne. "Obey me."

"Again, they can't see you." Gerald shakes his head.

"You can see me."

"Because I'm also dead," Gerald says.

"How did we die?"

"You're brother stabbed you in the head because you were a terrible king. I tripped and fell into your tomb on accident. Your brother found it amusing and had me buried with you."

"I knew my brother was heinous. I hope his reign was short and disastrous."

"It was actually quite prosperous. You were there."

"I was?" Harold asks.

"Yes, I think the stab wound made you more of an imbecile. You frequently forgot everything that happened over these past seven-hundred years," Gerald says.

"Seven-hundred years. My god, the world is so different. What is that man doing in front of the windows?"

"Taking a selfie."

"A selfie? What is that?"

"I'd explain it to you, but it entails several hundred years of technological advancements. You'd also forget the explanation in ten seconds."

"What is that face he's making?!" Harold points at the man. "Guards seize him. Throw him in the dungeon."

"Right on schedule." Gerald shakes his head.
