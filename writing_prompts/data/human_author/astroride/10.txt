##Tears of Death

Primvia sits on her throne of roses with a crown of lilacs. Across her domain, nature sings in the warm light of day. A small pool directly before her contains fish leaping into the air. At the bottom of the pool, a batch of eggs begins to hatch. Primvia closes her eyes as life begins before her.

A gust of wind wakes her. A tall man wearing loose clothing with callouses on his feet stands before her. His skin glows with youth in the sun, and his smile implies mischief. His eyes convey the wisdom of his age.

"Argint, to what do I owe the pleasure of your visit?" Primvia asks.

"Decet has gone missing. I was sent to look for him," Argint replies.

"Understandable, you are the fastest of us, but I haven't the faintest idea of where he is." Primvia stands from her throne. "Now, if you would be so kind to excuse me, I have flowers to tend."

"Iad said he saw Decet here," Argint says. Primvia stares at the sun.

"I should've know he'd give me away, and I thought I was his favorite aunt."

"I don't understand what you would want with Decet. His personality is quite dour," Argint says.

"Ah, but that's his appeal." Primvia moves closer to Argint." I spend all of my time in sunshine laughing. The brooding lord of darkness is a refreshing change of pace."

"I can understand wanting a change in environment, but you have cursed the lives of everything on Terra. If you don't care about the lives of our subjects, ask yourself how Decet feels about the arrangement," Argint says.

"Decet loves it here. He can tell you himself. Decet!" Primvia yells. In the corner of her domain is a large forest with foliage thick enough to block the sun to allow for nocturnal beasts to thrive. A pale man with glowing blue eyes steps out of the forest. His shoulders are slouched, but every step is filled with joy.

"Argint, it's so lovely that you decided to join us." Decet puts his arm around Primvia. Argint blinks several times.

"Wow, I wasn't expecting you to like her."

"Why wouldn't I love her? Her cheery demeanor brightens my existence."

"But you are creating a world where everything is immortal."

"Is that really a curse? Everyone dreads seeing me. Primvia is the first person who wants to talk with me." Decet's voice cracks. "It's wonderful."

"Yes, the trees have grown so large that animals have become trapped in them. The animals can't die so they are doomed to a life in pain. The fish have rapidly overpopulated the sea and spend the days starving. Humans have become largely sedimentary due to the old age. What youth do remain are left to care for them. Terra needs death. You need to leave here," Argint says.

"No, I don't want to leave her." Decet says. 

"And I want him to stay." Primvia steps before him and makes the vines grow from the ground. Argint flies above them.

"Alright, fine how about a deal." Argint holds out his arms. The vines recede, and Decet steps forward.

"I'm listening."

"For six months of the year, you'll be here with Primvia. For the other six months, you'll be harvesting the dead that you missed," Argint says. Primvia and Decet look at each other. 

"I think it's a good idea. Death makes life worth living," Primvia says.

"Alright, I accept your terms." Decet steps forward. Argint grabs Decet's arm and drags him out of Primvia's realm. When they leave, Argint quickly puts the end of a chain on Decet's wrist. The chain pulls Decet to the underworld without Argint who follows closely.

"Argint, what is this?" Decent struggles in the chain.

"It was crafted by Vulja. It extends to the edge of Terra to allow you to harvest souls but no further," Argint says.

"You lied to me. You broke your word as a god." 

"I was the god of lies before I was a messenger." Argint laughs. "Traspot gave me this role to keep me occupied. Thank you for allowing me to relive my former glory."

"Primvia will not stand for this," Decet cries.

"She's already been chained to her realm by Iad and Sate. She has no say in this." Decet hurls a curse at Argint who dodges it. Argint flies away from the god. "You have one consolation. You will see Primvia whenever a soul crosses from the world from the living to the dead. Enjoy those moments."

Argint flees the underworld.

From that day forward, every soul was greeted by a weeping man with a weeping woman behind them. They do not weep for the souls. They weep for the love they lost.
