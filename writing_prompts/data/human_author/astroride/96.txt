##The Once Great Kingdom

King Tiernan walks through the grand banquet hall with his head held high. The surrounding nobles whisper about him, and a few giggle. Tiernan gestures to the two guards behind him to suppress this disgrace. The guards look at each other for a few moments, and one of them walks next to Tiernan and points to the soldiers lining the wall. Tiernan snarls and keeps walking. The murmurs increase behind him.

Emperor Manole sits on his throne, and Tiernan's guards immediately bow. Tiernan stands tall refusing to sacrifice his personal dignity. Manole smiles and chuckles at Tiernan. The King doesn't need to bow; his mere presence is worse than any physical act.

"Tiernan, I mean King Tiernan." The look on Manole's face suggests the malapropism was intentional. "What brings you to my court today?"

"The Kingdom of Farlen is being besieged by raiders from the North. We request your assistance in suppressing it. Our realms have a long shared history that-"

"Yes, our shared history. Granul used to be a province of Farlen. We've come a long way since that time." Manole laughs at this own joke, and the suppressed laughter of the court erupts. Tiernan closes his eyes and bites his tongue. He wants to turn and scream at them. He wants to order their beheading, but he is forced to wait for a lull in their noise.

"The court in Farlen is proud of your success. My father spoke very highly of your father."

"Yes, I recall my grandfather frequently ranted about how your grandfather would snub him. You're lucky that I didn't make you wait a week in the courtyard." Manole's spit coats the floor. "Farlen deserves to be raided. It's an improvement in my opinion."

"But we have a wealth in history and culture not shared by the raiders."

"History and culture are worthless."

"That we'd willingly share with you." Tiernan gets on his knees before the Emperor. Manole smiles.

"You'd allow us access to your treasures?"

"Well, not all of it." Manole's face turns sour. "I do ask that you let us have a few artifacts."

"Of course." Manole scratches his chin. "It would serve a reminder as what you once were."

"Every realm needs a solid foundation," Tiernan says. 

"Our advisors shall work out the details later, but I will protect your realm. There are more conditions that will come later, but I trust that you will find them acceptable, Duke Tiernan." Tiernan almost attacks Manole on the spot, but he holds himself back. He will have to accept the demotion. It's better to have some power than none at all. This will be remembered as a dark period in Farlen history, and it will be succeeded by a new golden age where it reclaims its glory.
