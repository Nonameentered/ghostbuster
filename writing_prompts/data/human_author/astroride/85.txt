##The World Tree

The tree in James's backyard contained a world, and he used to spend every day with the Sapelings.

The Sapelings crafted him a crown of branches when he was three . His parents smiled when they saw it. James reigned with generosity. He granted them water, and he helped build their huts. They taught him their language and composed ballads to thanking him that were sung at their nightly ceremonies.

At six, the Sapelings no longer constructed huts. They towns on the leaves and miniature cities close to the trunk. They're ballads were no longer sung; rather, they left poetry on the branches. James was also no longer their sole topic. They began to write about their world and relationships with each other. They still held a nightly ceremony, but it was more elaborate.

At nine, James renounced his crown. Several kingdoms formed on the tree. Each claimed to be the crafter of his crown. James attempted to communicate that they created it together, but his words were ignored. Alliances formed amongst kingdoms, and he watched them declare war. Violence had existed in the past, but it was never on this scale.

At twelve, James watched the Sapelings as they ruined the tree. Their methods of war had become more advanced than humanity. Their languages had diverged to the point where James couldn't communicate with them. He could only watch as the branches fell with each battle. He occasionally threw water on them in the hopes that they would unite to fight a common threat. They never did.

At fifteen, the tree had to be removed from the yard. The Sapelings were killing it, and James's parents considered it to be a burden. James would've fought for them in the past, but the Sapelings were beyond saving. He witnessed atrocities whenever he looked outside of his window. He wondered if this was the fate for all civilization.

At eighteen, James moved out of his parents and forgot about the Sapelings. His life had no room for them.

At thirty-two, his parents announced that they were down-sizing and moving out of the house. James walked into the backyard for memories sake. At his feet, he found his old crown. He donned it, and the Sapelings emerged from the grass. That night, they had one last ceremony to honor their relationship. He put the crown in his suitcase to take with him. The Sapelings had a disastrous end, but the beauty they created deserved to be remembered as well.
