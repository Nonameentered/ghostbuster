##Defense of the Occult

The Magistrate stares at Helga with fire in his eyes. The townspeople shake with anticipation. Helga starts to cry. I cannot take it anymore.

"Objection." I stand and walk to the front of the room.

"Mr. Bruhl, please sit down. We understand the desire to protect your wife, but she has been convicted," the Magistrate says.

"Indeed, you are also most certainly bewitched you." The Inquisitor holds the witch finding book.

"She couldn't have bewitched me because I'm a witch," I say. The crowd gasps.

"Rudolf, what are you doing?" Helga asks.

"Saving you." I whisper to her. The crowd erupts in side conversations.

"Order," the Magistrate yells, "Mr. Bruhl, these are serious crimes that you are confessing."

"Indeed, but I am willing to take ownership of my actions."

"So you admit to dancing naked on the witches sabbath?" the Inquisitor asks.

"I did get drunk and dance naked last Tuesday." An elderly woman faints. "What? Don't judge me. Life is boring, and we all need to cut loose."

"You confess to signing a contract with the devil," the Inquisitor says. I pause for several seconds.

"Well, I'm not sure I can admit that."

"Why not?" the Magistrate asks.

"Because we're not supposed to speak ill of those who passed, and my mother-in-law has been dead for several years now." The audience roars at my comment. Even the Magistrate cracks a smile. The Inquisitor furiously pages through the book.

"Aha, it says here that witches have a mark on them. You must strip naked so we can find your mark." The room falls silent and stares at the Inquisitor.

"This seems like a no win situation. I'm on trial for stripping naked in private. Now, you wish for to strip naked in public to prove my innocent?" I ask. The audience snickers as the Inquisitor's face turns red. He pulls out a needle.

"The witch mark is impervious to pain. I'll poke you until you stop squealing." He pokes my arm slightly.

"Uh, was that supposed to hurt?"

"I found it. You're a witch." The Inquisitor dances in the middle of court. The Magistrate shakes his head.

"Calm down. Let me see that needle." The Magistrate takes it in his fingers and pricks himself. "That wasn't painful in the slightest. Let me see that book."

The Magistrate pages through it himself. "This is nonsense. This page recommends tossing a person in water with rocks attached. How would that solve anything?"

"Well, the water rejects the demonic-"

"And here, this one says a witch can't read the bible, pray, or be present on hallowed ground. I saw Mr. Bruhl in church last week. This book is nonsense."

"But sir, we need to find an explanation for crop failure."

"Bad luck." The Magistrate shrugs. "We've had worse years. I remember several when I was boy. We didn't go accusing people of witches then."

"But they were there. You just didn't-"

"Silence. If anyone is causing trouble, it's you. Case dismissed."

I grab Helga's arm. We spend the rest of the day partying and dancing with our friends. After the sunset, I take her to the lake.

"Thank you for that," Helga says.

"I couldn't let you die for my crimes," I reply.

"I didn't know you could cast such a powerful spell."

"That wasn't magic. That was shear persuasive ability." I hold Helga in my arms and start to fly. "It was also luck that the Inquisitor is an idiot."
