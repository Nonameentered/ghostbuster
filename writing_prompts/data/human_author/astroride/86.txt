##Café du Mort

"Would you like a scone?" Glinda holds out the small cake. Sweat drips onto her hand.

"Uh sure," I say. She shoves it into my mouth as I roll past her. Greg keeps turning me over the fire. I fall a few inches as I reach the ground. The rod hits my back at the top. "Could you tighten the ropes?"

"Of course." Glinda walks to the other side and pulls until I stop moving.

"Thank you." I chew on the scone, but it falls out of my mouth into the fire. "Can I have another one?"

"No, you only get one scone."

"But I barely ate that one."

"I said one scone. If you want another one, you can go make it yourself," Glinda shouts.

"Okay, well can I have a cup of coffee?" I ask.

"That's not the hot beverage." Glinda grabs a small tank and pours it on me. The smell overpowers my nose, and the flames rise. My nerves beg me to run, and my mouth screams. "Is that better?"

"Not really. I'm still thirsty," I say.

"You're going to be dead soon. Why does it matter?" Greg asks.

"I don't want to perched when I meet the companions," I say.

"You'll meet your companions in the afterlife if there is one," Glinda laughs.

"Oh, and will I be served there?" I ask.

"Uh, I don't know."

"Will there be other people there?"

"I mean we're going to bury you with our other victims."

"Oh, did they see the ad for the Lonely Midnight Café too?" I ask.

"No, we kidnapped them. To be clear, you realize that they're dead," Glinda says.

"So you're saying they're bad conversationalist."

"I'm just going to pour some more gas on you and hope you die faster." The flames rise, but this time they rise up to the tank causing a minor explosion. Glinda falls into the flame screaming. Greg jumps into save her, but he slips leaving me with my back to the fire. The cable breaks, and I fall in. After rolling out of the fire, I see them writhing and screaming.

"Water!" Glinda yells. I look around and find nothing.

"Man, this is a crap café if they don't even offer a glass of water."
