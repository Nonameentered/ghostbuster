##The Telescope and the Painting

“I wonder if it’s accurate,” Emma says. Her head is in her husband Chris’s lap. They stare at the attic ceiling with its painted stars and constellations. A telescope is pointed out the front window.

“We could look tonight. I can’t believe the realtor thought this would discourage us.”

“I think most people are uneasy with the previous owners being a bit quirky, but I like it. We could entertain guests up here.” Emma lifts her head up. “What’s that thing?”

Directly opposite of the telescope is a yellow smudge. It has no defined shape, and bits of it drip down the wall.

“Maybe the painter fell off his ladder?” Chris shrugs. “Either way, we could cover it.”


“Yeah I guess so.” Emma stands up. “Alright, that’s enough relaxing, back to work.”

The two set about making the building a home. As sweat pours off their face, they begin to wonder why they didn’t hire movers. They asked their friends, but they were busy.  

After Emma unpacks the silverware in the kitchen, she looks at her phone and realizes that it’s 7:30 PM. She quickly runs to the stairs; Chris is setting up the master bedroom.

“I’m going to get sandwiches from Mike’s? Do you want your usual?” she asks. Chris grunts in response. She shrugs. “I’ll take that as a yes. I’ll be back shortly.”

The night is darker than it should be, and there is a small speck of dust in her periphery. It probably came from the rafters. Houses are full of surprises. When she returns from the deli, she feels a sense of dread. It could be stress from unpacking, but it’s more intense and visceral. Chris is standing outside the house.

“Is everything okay?” Emma walks out of the car carrying the sandwiches.

“Something’s in there.” Chris’s fingers quiver.

“Oh my god, did you call the police?” Emma asks.

“No, they wouldn’t be able to help.” 

“Calm down. What happened?”

“I went to look through the telescope, and I saw that yellow smudge in the sky. Only it’s not a smudge. I think it’s an eyelid.”

“An eyelid.” Emma begins to laugh and turns around. “I think a lot of people would notice a giant eyelid in the sky.”

“I know it’s a violation of order and nature, but it’s there.” Chris grabs his wife’s arms. “You have to believe me.”

“Chris, you’re being weird.” Emma steps away from him. “It could be a speck on the telescope. That’s all.”

“Please can we sleep at a motel tonight?” 

“But our house.” Chris gets on his knees. Emma sighs. “Okay.”

They drive to a roadside motel a few miles away. The room smells of decay and febreeze, and the decor is thirty years out of style. Two of the lamps have dead bulbs. When Emma lies in her bed, she prays that it doesn’t have bedbugs.

“Emma.” Chris shakes her awake. She sits up.

“Chris, what time is it?”

“It’s two in the morning, but that’s not important. The eye followed us here.” Emma sits up in the bed and looks out the window behind him.

“There’s nothing out there.” She narrows her eyes at him.

“No, you don’t understand. It’s watching us, and it’s coming to Earth.” Chris takes a deep breath. “I need to finish the painting in the attic.”

“What the hell? You were just saying that you wanted to get away from it like six hours ago,” Emma says.

“I know, but the eye spoke to me in my sleep. It helped me work through my fear, and it showed me the unknowable. It showed me what we were not meant to understand. I now know how to embrace forbidden knowledge without fear.”


“I’m starting to be afraid of you.” Emma moves away. “You can go finish that weird painting, but I won’t be joining you.”

“Alright.” Chris kisses her hand. “I’ll walk. See you in the morning.”


Emma wakes up and checks for bug bites. In a miracle of nature, she’s fine. She quickly gets dressed and returns to her house. After taking a deep breath, she enters the house.

“Morning Chris, how’d the painting go?” she yells. No response. When she walks up the stairs, the dread from the night before fills her. Opening the attic door confirms her fears.

Chris lies on the floor with his mouth open and yellow drooling out of his mouth. His eyes are closed and covered in yellow. Emma screams and runs to him. His body is cold enough to hurt her hand. When she looks up at the wall, she sees the yellow smudge. The eye is open.
