##Hellfire

Satan walked into the room with his best suit. Well, it was the most appropriate for the situation. His best suit was made from the skin of sinners and was threaded with their screams. Jehovah made his disgusts known to Satan several times.

Jehovah's office was an understated display of power. Extinct birds flew in the air above him. The chairs were the perfect size and comfort for their occupants, but they didn't look expensive. The water was always the correct temperature. It was enough to make even Satan feel comfortable.

"I'm glad you could meet with me." Jehovah shook Satan's hand. The grip was firm and supportive. "I know you have a busy schedule."

"It's alright. It's nice to get out of Hell every so often," Satan said.

"I'd imagine. How are things down there?"

"Well, we..." Satan paused. He recently created a new feet crusher, but Jehovah wouldn't like to hear that. "There's a new noise machine."

"That's good." Jehovah pulled out a sheet of paper. "So I'd hate to do this." He slid the paper.

"You're...firing me?" Satan looked up.

"All of Hell is going," Jehovah nods.

"Why? I thought the point of Hell was torturing bad humans. There are certainly a lot of them."

"That's not your role."

"What are you talking about? My name literally means adversary. I'm supposed to be the enemy of all that is good." Satan stood and unleashed a pillar of fire that incinerated everything. God recreated it quickly.

"You're name also means accuser. You were supposed to challenge humans to help them grow and change. When you torture them, they don't change. To be honest, I think you like torturing them."

"Of course I like it. Removing tongues is enjoyable. If you wanted me to help them grow, you shouldn't have made Hell a place for eternal damnation." Satan shouted and unleashed a plague on the world. Jehovah tapped Satan on the head. Satan calmed himself. "Alright, I'll stop doing that, but you've got to have a good reason."

"Actually, I do." God waved his hand creating a word in the sky that read Purgatory. Beneath it was a large hill.

"What's that?"

"It's a place closer to my original goal. A place where humans are given the opportunity to grow and change. I want you and your staff to oversee it as a second chance," Jehovah said.

"Why didn't you lead with that?"

"Because I knew power had corrupted you, and I wanted you to understand that for yourself." Satan rubbed the back of his head.

"You're right. I have become quite sadistic and egotistical."

"It's alright. You have an opportunity to change your ways. Like the humans."
