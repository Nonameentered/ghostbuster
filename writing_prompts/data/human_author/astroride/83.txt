##At Grandma's House

Little Red Riding Hood sang to herself as she strolled through the forest. On the surface, it was a delightful image. Listening closer to her voice revealed a wavering confidence and a hint of reluctance. Her steps were slow to match her attitude, perfect for a wolf.

"Where are you going?" The wolf moved behind her. Little Red stopped in her tracks.

"I'm delivering food to my sick grandmother." She opened her basket. "Would you like to try the sausage?" 

"Wouldn't your grandmother be angry?" The wolf stepped back. He didn't want to be gifted food; he wanted to take the food. His hunger was for the challenge.

"She's always angry. I'd rather the sausage go to someone who enjoys it rather than a curmudgeon," she replied.

"It sounds like she just has a bad mood. I suggest picking flowers to cheer her up," the wolf said. Little Red shrugged.

"It won't work, but it can't hurt." Little Red began picking flowers as the wolf watched. She lingered and wafted in every scent before picking it. The wolf realized that Little Red wouldn't give her a challenge, but a challenge could be created.

Her grandma's house was known in the forest as a place to avoid. She didn't tolerate unwanted guests and chased any animals that stepped inside. Her food supply always seemed to be low giving little reason for animals to enter. 

When the wolf arrived at her house, he found the door open. He crouched and stalked through the narrow corridor. The old woman was sleeping in her bed. Frustrated by the lack of conflict. The wolf grabbed her leg and dragged her to the closet. Dawning her clothes, he jumped into the bed waiting for Little Red.

"Grandma, I brought some flowers and food," Little Red yells. The wolf smiles.

"Perfect, my dear. Come closer so I can," the wolf shouts. 

"Are you sick? Your voice sounds deeper." Little Red says as she walks to the wolf.

"I just wanted to give you a proper greeting." Little Red sighs and shakes her head when she sees the wolf.

"Really. You can't expect me to believe this," she says.

"What do you mean? Do you not recognize your grandma?"

"You have fur all over your body."

"It's a new coat."

"Your eyes, ears, and hands have changed shape."

"I just want to see, hear, and embrace you better."

"You have a snout." The wolf grew frustrated with Little Red.

"I just wanted to eat you better." The wolf tried to pounce on Little Red, but he was hit back with a hard metal object. When he opened his eyes, he saw Little Red standing over him with a small hammer.

"Do you really think I'd walk through the forest alone without any protection?" she asked.

"Red, what's going on out there? Why'd you put me in a closet?" Her grandma shouted from behind the door. "Get me out of here. It smells worse than you."

"In a minute, I'm dealing with a wolf," Little Red shouted back.

"A wolf. Why'd you let a wolf in here you idiot." Little Red sighed.

"I didn't. It snuck in while you were asleep."

"I would never do that. Don't lie to me. Your mother clearly failed to teach you the value of the truth," grandma said.

"I didn't realize how rude she was. Has she always been like this?" the wolf asked.

"Yep, she's a real pain," Little Red replied. The wolf crawled out of the covers.

"I'll leave you alone. You've clearly got a lot deal with."

"Wait, can I come with you? I've enjoyed your company more than I've ever enjoyed hers."

"I just tried to eat you."

"I don't care."

"Uh, sure I guess." Little Red followed the wolf carrying her basket and hammer. She tossed the flowers on the bed.

"See you next time Grandma," she yelled.

"Let me out of here right now."
