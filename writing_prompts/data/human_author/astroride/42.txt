##Red Ball

Red comes down from the air, and Lily catches it in her mouth. She leaps across the grass enjoying every single moment. When she drops it before me, I pet her head. She quickly collapses onto the ground to ask for a belly rub, and I oblige.

After a few seconds, I throw the red ball again. The ball was with her when I adopted her six years ago. I chose her because the pound said she was the only one potty trained. She has more value besides that.

When she brings the ball back to me, a small rock lands next to her. She jumps away barking at it, but I calm her down. The rocks keep coming from above, but there's no point in worrying. Some people hide in their bunkers, but I don't.

Lilly is panting terribly so I give her some water. I wipe the sweat off my brow. Days have been getting blisteringly hot recently. I heard Siberia reached 30Â° C yesterday, and it's still only November. Another rock comes down next to me.

I've stopped trying to dodge them. If it hits me, it hits me. No use delaying the inevitable. Lilly is better at dodging them; she's quite athletic. Granted, the rocks would do more damage to her.

I throw the ball again, and a meteor takes it out midair. Lilly barks some more so I sit next to her and pet her. She licks my face, and I smile. If I'm going to die, I'll die happy.
