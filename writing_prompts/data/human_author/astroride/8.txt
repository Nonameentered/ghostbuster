##One Concern in Life

Franklin hits the rock with his pick-axe. Everyone else has gone home to their families, but Franklin keeps working. No one is waiting for him. The outside world only serves to feed him. Everything else is in this mine. 

One strike removes a huge amount of rock. Franklin jumps back and looks at his arms. He ain't that strong. He keeps hitting the rock until he sees a large castle covered in flames. Screams of the damned fills his ears. A humanoid with red skin and bat wings flies down.

"Welcome to Hell." The demon runs his claws on Franklin's arms. Franklin looks at Hell.

"It's almost as bad as Cleveland," Franklin replies. The demon laughs.

"I think you'll find your stay less enjoyable than your time in Cleveland." The demon grabs Franklin's arm and takes him to the air. The air is filled with burning needles that puncture his skin. "How does this feel?"

"Meh."

"Meh." The demon laughs. "I'm going to have to try harder." The demon tosses Franklin into an ice cold pool. The fish in the water gnaw at his flesh and drag him into the depths. Franklin shrugs under water. The demon pulls him out.

"Wow, you're tougher than I thought." The demon puts a finger to his chin. "I've got it." The ground beneath Franklin collapses. He lands on a metal slab where demons hammer his entire body with hammers.

"How long is this going to take? I have a job to get back to," Franklin says.

"Is that really the worst part of Hell? Being away from your job," the demon says.  A small imp flies next to the demon and whispers in his ear.

"What do you mean he's still alive?"

"Wait, are you serious?"

"Oh, he's rare." The demon snaps his fingers and the hammers disappear. Franklin gently floats out of the hole and back into the coal mine while the demon follows.

"You're free to get back to work I guess."

"Thank you." Franklin nods and picks up his axe. "I guess I'll see you when I die."

"No you won't. Before you ask, you won't go to the other place either." The demon flies away and the rocks reform. Franklin shrugs and keeps digging. He'll dig until the day he dies and probably afterward. There's no place for him in Heaven or Hell because all he cares about is digging.
