King Demetrius slouched in his throne, radiating boredom. The emissaries stood a respectful distance before him, an elf and an orc.

Asteria, tall and slender, looked about twenty and was ten times that. She carried herself with the grace inherent to elvenkind, but her shoulders were stiff and her fingers twitched as if itching to nock an arrow into a bow every time she glanced at the orc.

Gruk, a towering mountain of a creature, was picking his enormous nose and inspecting the spoils on the tip of his sausage-thick finger. Demetrius observed in disgusted fascination before shaking himself off.

"So your complaint, Ambassador Asteria," he said slowly, "is that this orc hunted down a deer."

She jutted out her chin. "Not just any deer, sire. It was a sacred beast."

"Was delicious," the orc offered.

Asteria rounded on him, her face reddening to the tips of her pointy ears. Demetrius straightened up a fraction, then, seeing her master her anger, slouched again and waved back his guards.

"Be that as it may, it wandered into the orcish plains," he said. "Isn't that right, Ambassador Gruk?"

The orc grunted. "We not enter forest."

"He must be lying, sire," the elf gritted out. "A sacred beast is one that drank from the Well of Stars. Its flesh is permeated with magic and would be coveted by the brutes."

Comprehension dawned on the orc's beastly face. "Gruk wonder why his finger regrow! Wyvern bite it off many summer ago." He clenched a fist, grinning, then faced the elf. "Gruk sorry. Gruk hungry and see deer and hunt."

Asteria hissed out a breath. "Our losses are too great to be repaid with words."

"Why is that?" Demetrius asked, making himself more comfortable. "It is ultimately just a long-lived beast."

"Because it is central to our Summer Festival, sire," Asteria said in a long-suffering tone. "Our children lure it with berries, and decorate its antlers with flowers, and we sing to it." Her forest-green eyes glazed over, seeing something beyond the throne room, and she almost smiled before growing somber. "Or we would. The festival is a week away, and the tradition will be broken for the first time in a century."

Demetrius rubbed his chin, looking from one emissary to the other. "I believe I see a solution. You"—he pointed at the orc—"simply have to take the deer's place."

"You can't be serious, sire!" the elf cried. "An unkempt, smelly, sweaty orc amid our—"

"Elven festival stupid," Gruk blustered. "Grass for food and music make orc fall asleep—"

"Now, now," Demetrius said, suppressing a grin. "You just need to sit there prettily while they serenade you."

Asteria and Gruk cried out again, the latter's voice so loud it made Demetrius flinch. He raised a hand and fixed them with a stern look. "As the one with the power to adjudicate between your people," he said, a hint of steel entering his voice, "it's my final decision".

Asteria gritted her teeth and sketched a bow. Gruk grunted and slammed his fist against his chest. As the guards escorted them out of the throne room, Demetrius heard them grumbling to each other about the foolishness of humans.

He straightened up in his throne and allowed himself a smile. Elves and orcs were ancestral enemies and would pounce at each other's throats at the slightest provocation. Only during his reign did they settle into an uneasy peace. His secret? Making the two sides so exasperated with humans that they would put aside their differences if for a moment. It was a delicate balancing act, but such was the duty of the king.
