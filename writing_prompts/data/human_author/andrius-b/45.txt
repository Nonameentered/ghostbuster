The Sword of Annihilation thrummed in Jack's hand as he attacked the Demon Lord, each swing producing crescents of energy that gouged the marble floor. The demon backtracked, defending frantically, until Jack scored a gash across his chest. 

A burbling laugh rose from the Demon Lord's throat as the wound knitted instantly. "It's futile," he jeered, spreading his arms. "Powerful as your weapon is, I am proof against any sword other than the Dawnblade."

"Crud, I knew I was forgetting something. Which of your underlings was vulnerable to this one, again?" Jack snapped his fingers, struggling to remember. "Oh, well." He raked his left hand downward, creating a black rift mid-air, and shoved the Sword of Anihilation inside.

"What are you attempting now? No petty tricks will save you."

"Dawnblade, right? One second." Jack shoved his arm into the rift up to the elbow and rummaged inside.

"Fool! The Dawnblade slumbers deep within the deadly mountains of—"

"Mountains of Icefall, yes. Aha!" Jack smiled triumphantly as he produced a gleaming golden blade. "Nearly froze my unmentionables off up there, let me tell you."

"But... how..." The Demon Lord gaped at him, then swallowed. "Jack of All Swords... I thought you were only a legend."

"Master of none," Jack agreed, flicking the Dawnblade to test its balance. "Luckily for me, with stupidly powerful swords like these, I don't have to be."

The Demon Lord took a step back. "I shouldn't have told you my only weakness, should I?" he muttered.

"Nope," Jack said, raising the blade above his head.

"Perhaps we could come to an accord—"

Jack swung the Dawnblade. A brilliant beam of light pierced the ceiling of the Demon Lord's palace and consumed his horned figure, causing Jack to yelp and shield his eyes. Once he blinked away the red afterimages, all that remained of the world's most powerful demon was a circular scorch mark on the floor.

"Nifty," Jack said, blinking. "I'll have to remember this one."

Stowing the Dawnblade away, he skirted the scorch mark and took off in search of the treasury. Back when the gods granted him the power of Inventory, no one thought much of it, least of all he. Yet not only it helped him make a fortune as a merchant but also turned him into an unpredictable—and thus dangerous—warrior. Although he wasn't a master of any one weapon, he had the perfect one for any occasion. 

A heavy double door barred his way. There were no locks, but it didn't budge when he kicked it. Magic, then. He produced the Sword of Spelldrinking and waved it before him. Sure enough, a trail of sparks surged from the door and into the scintillating blade. 

Jack pushed the door open and grinned at the piles of gold and artifacts that greeted him. He already had more coin than he knew what to do with, but magical weapons were always handy. Whistling a jaunty tune, he started looting.
