Jacqueline had tried to keep a low profile at the Academy, she really did. Unfortunately, the elves and the fae and a plethora of others saw her very presence as an insult. In some way, it was. Were it not for the Republic bleeding the magical kingdoms during the war, humans would have never been allowed into the Academy.

"Look at you, prancing about these noble halls like you belong," said Theoden after he and his elven posse waylaid her on her way to the canteen. "I've just had enough of your human stench."

"Excuse me?" Jackie said. "I most certainly do not prance. And I'll have you know I shower every day." She considered those barring her way as she spoke and relaxed a little. The lackeys were of no consequence, and Theoden, although said to possess great power, was a pompous fool.

"It is not something you can wash off, human,"  Theoden said, turning up his nose. "It is the stench of inferiority."

"Uh huh." She tapped her foot. "Anything else you wanted to say? If not, move aside. I have places to be."

Theoden stared at her. "Have you no dignity? Aren't you even going to defend yourself?"

She laughed. "Why would I? Your words are like the yapping of a dog too afraid to bite."

Theoden's high-cheekboned face flushed red. Peeling off his white glove, he tossed it at her feet. "For your contempt for your betters, I challenge you to a duel."

Jackie glanced down and nudged it with her foot. "All right, then," she said casually. "We can use any magic or enchanted weapon, right?"

The elf appeared surprised at her nonchalance but quickly hid it behind a sneer. "Indeed. You have learned the rules, at least."

She nodded. "How about we do it after dinner tonight? I have a busy day of class tomorrow."

"So be it," Theoden hissed. He gestured to his lackeys and turned to leave with a dramatic swish of his cloak.

The Academy's courtyard was packed with students, leaving an empty oval down the middle. Jackie stood on one end, Theoden on the other. From the looks of dark glee the spectators directed at Jackie, they expected her to get badly beaten. Between them hunched Professor Olga, who was to officiate the duel. The hag was known to be impartialâ€”which was to say, she hated everyone equally.

Theoden caught her gaze and sneered. Jackie stiffened when she spied a long thin sword strapped to his belt, but to her relief, he didn't show any inclination to draw it. Typical. Elves were proud of their magic the most and loved to lord their abilities over their inferiors.

Professor Olga rasped, "Are you ready?"

Jackie nodded and reached under the lapel of her jacket to adjust her holster.

"You will learn your place tonight, human," Theoden said to approving murmurs from the elves in the crowd.

Jackie rolled her eyes. Professor Olga raised her gnarled hand high into the air, then brought it down. "Begin."

Theoden smiled and threw his hands into the air. "Mother Earth, heed my call," he cried. "Rouse your fury and bind my enemy in a prison of thorns."

The cobblestones of the courtyard cracked apart as vines erupted through the gaps and slithered toward Jackie. For a moment, she only stared out of sheer incredulity. To think the fool would choose such a roundabout method; no wonder the elves lost against the Republic.

She reached into her holster and pulled out one of her four wands. Mass-produced in the Republic's mage workshops, it lacked elegance and required little skill to wield. In other words, it was a weapon of war.

Even as the vines bound her feet, she calmly took aim and let loose. An energy missile burst forth and hit Theoden's thigh, and the elf collapsed with an agonized scream.

A stunned silence reigned in the courtyard as she pulled her feet free of the vines and unhurriedly approached her opponent, wand held loosely at her side. Theoden glowered at her, clutching his bleeding thigh. Pausing before him, she aimed the wand between his eyes. The elf blanched.

"I yield," he whimpered, any sign of superiority gone from his pale mien.

Jackie stared him in the eye until he began to tremble, then nodded briskly and sheathed her wand.  The onlookers parted before her as she strode out the courtyard, murmuring behind her back. There was a reason why humanity had withstood the combined assault of the magical kingdoms, and if need be, she would remind them all.
