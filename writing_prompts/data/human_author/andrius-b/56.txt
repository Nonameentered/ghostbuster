Tanya's shoes clacked on the bone-paved road, her messenger bag thumping against her back. The skies were a dark purple, and black rain fell upward from the District of the Dead. The necromancers were performing another ritual. It was fortunate she had no deliveries there today; the last time she got caught in that rain, the black didn't wash off for weeks.

She oriented herself by the organic towers spiraling toward the sky and jumped off into a side path. Bony spikes shot up, trying to trip her and spear her vulnerable flesh, but she danced around them without slowing. The less-traveled roads were always the hungriest.

Rounding a corner, she came face-to-face with a tentacle lady who clicked her beak indignantly.

"Glurk, watch where you're going, ugly!"

"Glurk yourself," Tanya retorted, flipping her the middle finger. She wasn't sure what the gesture meant, but she found it in an old book from Above.

The lady's tentacles billowed threateningly, but Tanya was already skipping away. She emerged onto a wider path and weaved through the crowd. Some passersby paused and stared. Others just went on their way, already used to the sight of a human girl scurrying about.

Tanya got her bearings and took a chute to the lower levels, grimacing as the pink glistening walls undulated her down. She found herself in a rounded passage illuminated by pillars of fluorescent gas streaming from the city's bowels and walked along until she smelled the stench of blood and other body fluids best left unmentioned. It seemed to be emanating from a doorway ahead that had skulls of all shapes and sizes affixed around it. 

That had to be the Surgery.

The smell only got worse up close. Pausing by the entrance, she tied a handkerchief around her nose and ventured inside. Muffled screams and moans echoed from all around, interspersed by noises of sawing bone and wet squelches. Tanya swallowed nervously.

A snick sounded behind her. She whirled around and gasped. Before her quivered a mountain of flesh with too many eyes and limbs, all of the latter ending in gleaming scalpels, syringes, and scissors. And unless she was much mistaken, the scissors had just taken off a lock of her hair.

"Come for a vivisection, my dear?" the creature asked in an unexpectedly smooth voice. "I don't believe you're on my list, but I will make an exception for a poor wretch like you."

Tanya gulped and almost took a step back. Almost. "What do you think you're doing?" she demanded in a slightly quivering voice. "Keep your instruments off me. I only came to deliver a package."

"My apologies," Surgeon crooned. "I simply couldn't hold back after seeing your pathetic form. How do you make do with those meager four limbs of yours?"

"Four is enough for me, thank you very much," she muttered as she unclasped her bag. The package oozed slime and quivered in her hands, and she really didn't want to know what was inside. "Here."

Surgeon gently pinched the package with a forceps, his mouths curving into smiles. "Ah, excellent. I've been waiting for this for some time." His eyes swiveled back to Tanya. "Are you quite certain you wouldn't like a tentacle or five? Perhaps a few more eyes? Your form is so disgustingly... symmetrical, it hurts to look at you."

The feeling is mutual, Tanya thought. "No, thanks. See you around, Surgeon."

She ran off without waiting for a reply and climbed a thorn vine to the street level. The dank air seemed almost sweet after the stench of the lower levels. She pulled out her list and grimaced, looking up at the spiraling towers. The next delivery was for one of those gasbags always hanging out by the sulfur clouds.

Well, one had to make her living in this place somehow. Adjusting her bag, Tanya ran to the closest tower and up the bony steps.
