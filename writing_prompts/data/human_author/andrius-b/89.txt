The roof tiles were pleasantly warm under Sam's bare feet as he made his way to his room on the third floor of an inn. Small yet cozy, it provided easy access to the roofs, which was most convenient for someone of his profession. Halting by the gable window, he glanced down into the street to make sure no one was watching and slipped inside.

Such carnage greeted him that for a moment he could do nothing but gape. His wardrobe stood ajar, the coin he had stashed under the bed for emergencies lay haphazardly on the table, and crumbs littered the floor. Atop his bed, her bare legs crossed and a book in her lap, sat the culprit: Lilian, Princess of Hell, the Dark Sorceress, and the bane of his existence. She was cackling and taking bites from a raspberry pie in her hand, which, judging by the stains of jam on her shirt, wasn't her first.

"Welcome back, master," she chirped, raising her head from the book and giving him a wave. "Had a productive day of breaking the Eighth Commandment, I hope?"

Sam winced as her motion scattered more crumbs over his previously immaculate bed. "Such things require planning. I was merely observing a prospective target to learn their habits."

"That must've been a chore," Lilian said with something akin to sympathy. "*Observing* is all I did for the better part of the century before you undid the seal."

*Biggest mistake of my life*, Sam thought. He latched the window, eyeing the mayhem with exasperated resignation. "I thought I told you not to leave the room. What if someone catches on to your nature?"

"I can hide my horns, and the innkeeper wasn't looking anywhere near them, anyway." She shimmied her shoulders, making her ample breasts jiggle.

Sam coughed and averted his gaze, only to swivel back. "Is that my favorite shirt?" he demanded, striding closer.

She glanced down her front and had the grace to look abashed. "Well, what was I to do? You told me to stop prancing about naked, and I was sealed without clothes of my own."

"And Master Konrad's latest book?" he asked, eyeing the grease-stained pages.

"I was bored!" she whined. "And you mortals do come up with pretty great stories. Listen to this, the protagonist goes to the moon and meets—"

"Shut up! Just... be quiet for a minute." Sam took several controlled breaths, clenching his fists. It didn't sit right with him, to give up the spoils of the greatest heist in his life, and yet... "That's it. You can't go farther than a few dozen steps from the jewel, right? I'm returning it to the wizard, then, and you're coming along."

Lilian's eyes widened, and the pie slipped from her hand to plop onto the sheets. She stared at him in horror before pouncing and hugging him around the waist.

"You can't!" she wailed. "You *can't*, master! There's nothing in that basement but dusty encyclopedias and rats!"

"Not my problem, is it?" He tried and failed to free himself of her desperate grip. "And stop calling me master! I never asked to be saddled with you."

"You're the one who set me free, so take responsibility!" she cried. "Feed me and entertain me for the rest of your lifespan!"

Sam opened his mouth to retort, only to wince when the tenant below gave a muffled yell and banged on the ceiling. He stepped heavily toward the floorboard under which he had concealed the jewel, dragging the demoness along. 

"Wait! No! I—I'm sorry for making a mess!" Unable to stop him, Lilian broke into loud sobs. "The book was so *interesting* and the pies tasted *so amazing*... I'll be good, I promise..."

Sam swallowed. With her snotty nose and teary eyes, she didn't look much like a Dark Sorceress at all. And being trapped in a basement for eternity wasn't a fate he would wish on someone who wasn't even an enemy.

"I'll listen to everything you say," she wailed on. "I'll help you with my magic. And I'll give you your shirt back." She started undoing the buttons, baring her tan skin.

Heat rose to Sam's cheeks. "Keep it for now," he said gruffly. "I'll see about picking up something for you to wear tomorrow."

She blinked at him. "Really?"

He nodded, not meeting her eyes. "If you're to help me, I'll need to take you outside, and I can't have you attracting undue attention."

Lilian's eyes widened before she squealed happily and tackled him to the floor. "Thank you, master!" she cried into his chest. "I won't disappoint you, promise!"

Sam groaned as more angry banging came from downstairs. Every promise Lilian had given him, she had broken shortly thereafter. Yet she clung to him with such desperation that he just didn't have the heart to get rid of her.
