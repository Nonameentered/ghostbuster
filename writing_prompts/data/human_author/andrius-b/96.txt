Josh slouched on the sofa clutching his sobbing wife. His parents, who had dropped everything as soon as they had heard and taken the maglev across the States, sat across, and a rapid response psychiatrist stood beside him. A press mob blathered outside the house, reporting on the unprecedented catastrophe.

"You'll get over it," his father said uncomfortably.

Josh whimpered and began to hyperventilate. His wife gasped and clutched his hand, while the psychiatrist glared at his father, who just shrugged. He was a man of a century and a half and retained some strange views on the world.

"I'm with you," his wife said, tears misting her eyes. "We're all here for you, Josh."

He sniffled and nodded. "W-will I ever be the man that I was? " he asked, peering down at his shaking hands. "I still see it each time I close my eyes. The carton slipping through my fingers. Falling on the floor—spilling on my favorite pants—milk *everywhere*—" Burying his face in his hands, he broke into heaving sobs.

His wife hugged him, sobs wracking her own body. "Oh, Josh. Oh, I'm so sorry."

"I won't promise miracles," the psychiatrist said grimly. "The road to recovery will be long and arduous. But with therapy and appropriate medication, you should be able to overcome your trauma eventually."

"T-thanks, doc," Josh murmured, wiping his eyes with the back of his hand. "I'll try to stay strong. For my family." He smiled tearily at his wife, then glanced through the window. "Do you think I should to talk to the press? The world has to know what happened."

"Out of the question," the psychiatrist said, shaking his head. "The stress might trigger a relapse."

His father rolled his eyes like the insensitive relic that he was. "I'll go tell them."
