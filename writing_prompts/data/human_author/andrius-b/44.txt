Dave's eyes flew open and beheld the frosted hatch of his cryopod. He inhaled deeply and pushed it, but it wouldn't budge. A muffled siren blared outside. The realization that something had gone wrong slowly percolated to his mind. 

Bracing himself, he pushed with his legs, but it was for naught. He snarled and punched the hatch, even knowing it wouldn't do anything, only to gape as a black blade formed before his fist and tore clean through it. Shaking off his surprise, he clawed himself out like a sardine out of a can.

The other cryopods were mangled and empty, and shards of glass littered the floor. He ventured out into the hallway, following the blaring of the siren. Blood splattered the walls, and a corpse of a researcher lay ahead, mauled as if by a wild animal.

Swallowing, he gave it a wide berth. It was coming back to him: Hephaestus had captured an alien queen and was researching her power, trying to make it theirs. And he had volunteered to be implanted with the prototype. 

Dave glanced down at his hands, but the blade had disappeared and wouldn't come out no matter what pose he struck. Well, if he did it once, he could do it again.

He rounded a corner and froze as he came across another corpse upon which feasted a spider-like creature with far too many eyes. They all swiveled his way, and it lunged at him with a screech. Dave raised his hands defensively, and a cloud of black motes appeared before him like a shield. When the creature came in contact with it, its flesh disintegrated, and it flopped lifelessly to the floor.

He slowly lowered his arms and nudged it with his foot. "Huh, cool."

A powerful voice spoke into his mind, causing him to stumble. "*You're not one of my children, yet you wield the Swarm. What are you*?"

"Name's Dave," he said, rubbing his forehead. "Who the hell are *you*?"

"*I am Ievea, mother of legions and scourge of your puny race*."

His pulse raced in realization. It appeared the procedure had done more than just give him power over nanites. 

"*Perhaps I can make use of you*," she mused. "*I lay trapped in the lower levels of this place. Free me, and in turn I shall teach you to free yourself from the limits of your pathetic body. We can rule the galaxy together.*"

A smile stretched over his face. "Could you repeat that?"

"*Does your primitive mind not comprehend*?" she snarled. "*I offer you a place at my side. I offer you power and ascendance from your inferior form*."

"No, no, my mind comprehends," he said contentedly. "I just wanted to hear you say it again."

"*What are you blathering about, insect*?" If an alien superintelligence could sound surprised, she certainly did. 

"Oh yeah," he muttered. "Step on me, mommy."

Ievea was silent for a time. "*I don't comprehend the purpose of your request. I do not even possess feet as your kind knows them*."

"Oh," he said, disappointed. "Got any tentacles? Those are great too."

"*Cease wasting my time, insignificant wretch*," she hissed. "*I see now that it would be more prudent to assume direct control over you*."

Pain lanced through his head, sending him to his knees. The telepathic appendages of a greater presence scraped the insides of his skull, rummaging through his deepest thoughts. Then, abruptly, they recoiled with a screech that made him wince.

"That *was the reason you volunteered for the procedure*?" she demanded. "*Not to save your kind, but to satisfy your appetites*?"

"Hey, don't judge," he said, slowly rising to his feet. "Your offspring were munching on human flesh, and that's way more messed up in my book."

"*You are*... *unclean, wrong*," she said shakily. "*Dispose of this abomination, my children. You must dispose of it at any cost*!"

The queen's voice cut off, leaving him alone in his head again. The skittering of dozens of legs from the hallway ahead reached his ears. He sighed and raised his fists, coating them with a swarm of nanites. "Aww, I thought we had a good vibe going."
