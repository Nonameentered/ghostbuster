Ed scowled at the red hand prints on the window and glanced right and left. The hallway was empty. The culprits must be on their way home by now, nose down in their phones like most brats were these days.

"It's not even creative," he grumbled, reaching into his janitorial cart for Windex and a microfiber cloth. "Back in my day, we had proper pranks, not this nonsense."

He sprayed the hand prints and was heartened to see the paint run off. Wetting the cloth, he set to wiping the glass. Thank god he found it before the paint could dry; that would've been a pain to clean.

After wiping away the paint, he washed the cloth and picked up a squeegee. He sprayed the window again, squeegeed it off, and eyed the glass critically. There was nothing glamorous about being a janitor, but it was his job, and damned if he wasn't going to do it properly. Not enough people did these days.

Finally satisfied, he tidied away his equipment and wheeled the cart onward, only to halt in his tracks. A girl wearing the school's uniform stood in the middle of the hallway, her head ducked so low that her face was entirely obscured by her long black hair.

Ed shrugged and pushed the cart to the side. "Excuse me, coming through."

The girl jerked up her head, flicking her hair away from her pale face, and stared at him with bloodshot eyes. "Aren't you scared?"

"Stop fooling around," Ed said, walking past her. "And spend less time on your phone; you'll ruin your eyes."

The girl cackled. He frowned and glanced over his shoulder. With an audible *crack*, she swiveled her head around without moving her body and grinned at him.

"Are you scared now?" she rasped.

"Jesus Christ!" Ed cried, letting go of his cart. "Are you all right?"

The girl's manic grin faded. "W-what?"

Ed ran up to her. "You must've dislocated your neck. Don't move, I'm taking you to the nurse." Stooping, he lifted her up in his arms.

"Let me go!" The girl slapped his chest. "How come you aren't scared?"

"Oh, I'm scared, all right!" Ed yelled, marching down the hallway. "What were you thinking, pulling a stunt like that? You could end up paralyzed! Don't tell me it's another one of those dumb TikTok challenges?"

"I'm already dead, moron," she hissed, "and I'll drag you to the underworld too!"

"Look, that's no way to talk to an adult,"  Ed said indignantly. "I may not have a degree, but it's my job to take care of you kids too. Now stay still or you might make your injury worse."

The girl ceased struggling and just peered at him inscrutably with her bloodshot eyes. Ed carried her to the nurse's office and turned sideways to shove the door open with his shoulder.

"Nurse!" he bellowed. "You have a patient."

The airy office was empty. Ed bit back a swear and carefully set the girl down on a bed. The nurse was probably having yet another coffee break with the security guard.

"I'm going to find the nurse," he said. "Stay here until she takes a look at you."

The girl frowned and half-rose from the bed. "There's nothing she can do to help me—"

"Don't say that. Nurse Edmunds is perfectly qualified." He jabbed a finger at the girl. "Now stay in bed and don't move!"

"Y-yes sir," the girl said meekly, and reclined on the pillow.

He nodded in satisfaction and doubled back to the hallway. Pausing at the doorway, he glanced over his shoulder to make sure she was laying still. "Everything will be fine. The nurse will be by soon."

The girl nodded slightly, watching him with a pensive gaze. He had pegged her for a troublemaker at first but she seemed a decent sort. He would have to tell the nurse to give her a full check-up—she might not be eating enough, what with how pale she was.

Ed closed the door and headed for the guard's office. As he rounded a corner, he almost ran headlong into another kid—a boy not in school uniform. 

"Are you a student here?" Ed demanded, looking him over. Was that a *sword* at his waist? "Which class are you in?"

The brat didn't acknowledge him. Leaning closer, he sniffed the air and reached for the hilt of his sword. "You smell like an aberration. Are you one, or did it touch you?"

Ed crossed his arms. "Give me a break, I've been sweating all day cleaning up after you kids. Now answer my question." 

"Not before you answer mine," the boy said, drawing his sword. "If you don't, I'll have to eliminate you."

"Hey, you put that thing down! You'll poke someone's eye out with that."

The corners of the boy's lips curved up. "Wrong answer."

His figure blurred, then vanished altogether. Ed blinked and looked around. The boy stood several feet behind him, his sword extended to the side. Those damn fumes from the cleaning chemicals must be taking a toll on his poor eyes.

"Right, that's it," Ed said. "I'm taking you to the principal."

The boy sheathed his sword and smirked. "Idiot. I cut you twenty-seven times; you just don't know you're dead yet."

"Yeah, yeah." Ed caught the boy by the collar and dragged him down the hallway. "What is this sort of thing called again—cosplay? I don't care what you kids do for fun, but rules are rules. You have to wear your uniform at school."

The boy followed him for a few steps before squirming in resistance. "T-that's impossible! How are you alive?"

Ed shook him by the collar. "Rude little brat. I'm not even fifty yet."

The boy squawked indignantly and babbled some more, but Ed just firmed his grip and dragged him to the principal. Kids these days had their heads filled with nonsense. A firmer hand, that was what they needed.
