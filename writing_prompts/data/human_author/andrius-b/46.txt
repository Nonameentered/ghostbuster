"Ma, come quick! I found somethin' weird!"

Guri looked up from the pot of stew she was cooking and glared at her grimy, windswept son. "What you on about, Brog? Been playing in the forest again?"

Brog shrank back under her glare. "That's not important, ma! I found an elf!"

Guri stiffened. "An elf? What he doing here? See more than one?"

"Just a wee little thing, alone." Brog scrunched up his face. "I think it's a she, but can you tell with their sort?"

"Take me there," Guri said, wiping her hands on a rag. "Right now."

Brog nodded and bolted out of the yurt. Guri followed at a more measured pace, easily catching up to his shorter strides. As she suspected, the rascal did bring her to the outskirts of the forest. 

"It's just down there!" he said, pointing at a small hollow.

Guri came closer and stared. At the bottom of the hollow lay a little elven girl. Her hair was matted and stuck with burrs. Her dress was made of fine fabric but was ripped and dirty, and her pale skin was sunburnt. 

Coming to a split-second decision, Guri descended into the hollow, heaved the girl onto her shoulder, and headed back. The poor thing hardly weighed more than a sack of grains, but she wasn't sure if it was because she had starved or just because of the puniness of her kind.

"What we gonna do with it, ma?" Brog asked, falling in step. "Can I play with it?"

"Don't be daft." Guri aimed a cuff at his head, which the welp avoided with practiced ease. "She looks like she'll break from just a little roughhousing."

Brog sighed. "Yes, ma."

Guri brought the elfchild into her yurt and set her down on a bear pelt. Brog hovered nearby, peering at her with undisguised curiosity.

"See if it's a girl, ma!"

Guri whacked him on the head. "Stop jabbering and fetch water from the well. She's burnin' up."

Brog scampered off and soon returned with a bucketful of water. Guri wet a rag and wiped the grime off the girl's face and arms. Without the layer of dirt, she was pretty enough, for all the sore lack of fangs and the unnatural paleness of her skin.

The girl jolted up with a gasp as Guri was wringing out the rag. Her blue eyes darted around in a panic, and she scampered backward.

"Easy," Guri said. "We mean no harm."

"Mah name's Brog," the whelp announced, jabbing a thumb at his chest. "I found ya!"

The girl flinched and retreated further until  her back pressed against the canvas of the yurt.

"Not so loud, ya dolt," Guri snapped. "Can't you see the poor thing's terrified?"

Brog snorted. "Ya scared her more than I did, ma."

Indeed, the girl shook like a leaf as her gaze darted between them. Guri gave her a chip-toothed smile, but that only caused her to blanch and let out a soft meep. Sighing, she scratched her braided head, then perked up. Food. Even her wimpy race had to eat, right?

"Ya hungry?" she asked. The girl only stared, wide-eyed. Guri ladled a bowl of steaming stew, stuck in a wooden spoon, and approached the girl with what passed for immense patience for an orc. "Here. 's not much, but it's filling."

The girl looked up at her face, then the bowl. Swallowing, she shakily extended her hands and took it. She was so tiny the bowl seemed huge in her lap. 

Guri grinned at the victory. "Go on, eat."

Not letting her wary gaze off Guri, the girl picked up the spoon, scooped up some strew, and brought it to her nose for a sniff. She took a gingerly bite. Her eyes widened. Swallowing quickly, she dug into the stew.

"Atta girl," Guri said, chuckling. "Not too quickly, lest you get sick."

The girl ate for a minute, but soon her hand slowed, and her eyes brimmed with tears. She ducked her head and sobbed, tears dripping into the bowl.

Brog cackled. "Yer stew so bad it made her cry!"

"You shut up!" Guri snapped. "Aw, crud... Is it 'cause your people don't eat meat?"

The girl shook her head without looking up. "I don't have a people." Her voice was so soft that Guri almost had to strain her ears.

Guri tilted her head. "Aren't you an elfchild?"

"I'm no elf," she hissed with sudden vehemence.

"But ye have knife-ears!" Brog said, jabbing a grimy finger her. "Look, they all pointy and stuff!"

Guri rounded on him, then blinked. "My whelp's got a point."

The girl sniffled and raised her hands to cover her ears. "My mother's an elf... but my father was human."

"Was?" Guri asked. "What happened to him?"

The girl shook her head. "G-gone. Mother's family came to demand that she return to the village. Father got angry. They fought, and... and they took mother away."

"And you?" Guri asked, frowning. "They just leave you to fend for yourself?"

"Th-they said I was an abomination," she sobbed. "That I had no place among them."

"Bah! And those elves call *us* savages." Guri spat onto the packed dirt floor and leaned closer to the girl. "Listen, squirt, you will have a place in my home for as long as you like. But I won't have you calling yourself an abomination or any such thing. Are we clear?"

"Y-yes," the child squeaked, bobbing her head.

"Good," Guri grunted, drawing back. "Now finish that stew while I find somethin' sturdier you can wear."
