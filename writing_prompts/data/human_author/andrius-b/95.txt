Max entered the spaceport bar and squinted at the dim interior. The light was at the lower end of the visible spectrum, and the ceiling was too low. This far from Federation space, no one catered to humans.

Indeed, as he made his way to the bartender with dozens of robotic arms, he only saw the floating jellyfish-like Ne'ato, the living computers Arcala on their wheelchairs, and other aliens. There was even a hive of krelx sipping syrup through their long proboscises in a corner. They used to give him the creeps, but his career as a spacer had long since cured him of such nonsense.

He sat down at the bar and stared at the holoscreen. The symbols on it made no sense, and when he poked a few, they changed to bands of color that made even less. Perhaps the thing wasn't even loaded with human language.

Just as he debated ordering a drink at random and risking poisoning, an Arcala rolled up from behind. Roughly four feet tall, it resembled a shimmering crystal with lights dancing over its facets.

"Hola, Ni hao, Saluton, Privet, Shalom, Bonjour," rattled off the speaker above its wheels. "Hello—"

"Hello," Max said with a smile. "What's up?"

Yellow lights flickered along the alien's crystalline surface. "The ceiling," it said at length. "Then approximately five inches of superalloy. Then approximately nine kilometers of atmosphere, mostly carbon dioxide—"

"Forget it," Max said, his smile wavering. This far from the human arm of the galaxy, they probably still used translation protocols from the First Contact. He would have to be blunt and literal. "What do you want?"

The Arcala took several seconds to digest his words. "Human. My records claim that you are able to"—his voice went abruptly higher—"*pick up* objects with your natural limbs. I wish to witness it empirically."

Max snorted. "Tell you what—buy me a drink, and you can watch me pick it up all you want."

Lights danced quickly over the Arcala's surface. "Affirmative. We have a deal, yes." 

It directed an antenna at the bar, and the screen flickered through hundreds of cryptic languages before settling on English. Max groaned in appreciation at the drinks on display and chose a whisky, and in a minute, the bartender set down the dewy glass before him. He picked it up and took a sip.

The Arcala inched uncomfortably close and extended multiple sensors at his arm. Max squirmed at the invasion of his personal space but decided the alien deserved this much. Tipping his glass to it, he took another sip.

"Unparalleled dexterity," the Arcala remarked, closely following his every move. "Unseen anywhere else in a naturally evolved system. Is it true that you use most of your brain power to move your marvelous limbs?"

 "I s'ppose," Max muttered, relishing the whisky. For something synthesized light-years away from the nearest human world, it wasn't half bad.

"And is it true that humans hunt for food by manipulating—propelling—*throwing* rocks?"

He chuckled. "Not for a few million years."

"I wish to witness throwing empirically."

Max turned toward the Arcala and blinked. At some point, most of the bar's patrons had gathered around, their varied optical organs fixated on the glass in his hand. They hooted and beeped and chirped in agreement, and those not possessing voice boxes made holographic letters appear above their heads. *Throw*, they said. *Throw, human*.

Max glanced down at his drink, then back at the crowd. He drained the whiskey, reared his arm, and chucked the glass at the wall, where it shattered into fragments. The crowd erupted in alien cheers, and the Arcala flashed with such dizzying frequency that someone prone to seizures would have been in grave danger.

"Incredible," the Arcala warbled. Somehow even his dry synthesized voice managed to sound awed. "You *threw* it. With your *hands*. And it flew."

Max grinned wryly. "So it did." 

"Can you throw an object"—the Arcala hesitated as if awed by the very idea—"and *catch* it before it falls?"

Max fixed the alien with a speculative look. "Well," he said slowly. "I could use another drink..."

The crowd surged closer and stuck their tentacles and cybernetics and other limbs at the screen, wiping the flashing warning about property damage and loading more credits into his tab than he could drink in a month. Sighing good-naturedly, Max picked up the new glass the bartender set before him, took a long draft, and weighed it in his hand. It would have been nice if humanity were famed for its ingenuity, or determination, or even strength. But if throwing stuff got him free drinks throughout most of the galaxy, who was he to complain?
