Arwyn tilted her head up at the walls of the dragonkin village. They stood massive and imposing, just like the locals who emerged through the gate to meet them. Lum, her half-brother, stepped in before her protectively. The gesture would have been sweet had she not known that he was just looking for an excuse to fight. Half-orcs still had an awful lot of orc blood.

"What is your business here, travelers?" thundered the dragonkin at the forefront, spreading his wings.

Arwyn laid her hand on Lum's broad shoulder to stall his undoubtedly rude response. "We're searching for a certain human adventurer, and we have reason to believe he has passed through your village."

The dragonkin scanned them with his slit-pupil gaze, and a strange recognition crossed his face. "By my wings, I believe I know who you're talking of. He has done a great deed for us fifteen years ago."

"Our old man's a mighty warrior," Lum said proudly.

"Mighty, yes. And..." The dragonkin shook his head and turned toward the gate. "Come, there's someone you should meet."

Arwyn and Lum followed him into the village, craning their necks. Everything seemed larger around here, from the sprawling roundhouses to the doorways tall enough to accommodate the horned inhabitants.

The dragonkin took them to a square of packed dirt where a group of youths were fencing and wrestling under the supervision of elders. He put his clawed fingers to his lips and whistled shrilly. 

"Calix! Come here!"

A teenage boy at the edge of the square looked their way. Laying down his spear, he wiped his sweaty brow and hurried over. His build was slighter than that of his kin, and the features of his face were softer. Suspicion mounted in Arwyn's mind. 

"You called me, elder?" the boy asked, glancing curiously at Arwyn and Lum.

"These travelers are looking for your father. I thought it would be good for them to meet you."

Calix scowled. "That good-for-nothing human? What for?"

"Oi!" Lum roared, stepping forward. "Dad's a great man!"

Arwyn gripped his upper arm. "Don't you see, Lum?" she said shakily. "He's one of us."

Lum's head swiveled toward her, then back to the dragonkin boy. "Little brother!" he bellowed and enveloped him in a bear hug.

"L-let go!" Calix cried, struggling to free himself. "I'm no brother to a great smelly oaf like you!"

"Smelly? You brat, I took a dip in a river not a week ago!" Slinging his hairy arm around the dragonkin's shoulders, Lum tousled his hair, only to grunt when the boy elbowed him in the stomach.

"Calm down, you two!" Arwyn cried.

It was no use. The newfound siblings fell to the ground, snarling and trying to wrestle each other into submission. Lum was older and more muscular, but Calix possessed sharp horns and a tail which he used to great effect. In no time, the two were bruised and covered in dust head to toe. The dragonkin who had brought them here only chuckled; apparently such a greeting was considered normal in their society.

Arwyn growled and raised her hands sharply. The air here was arid, but her magic was strong, and a sphere of icy water swiftly formed before her. With a huff, she tossed it over her wrestling half-siblings.

The two gave comically similar shrieks and looked up at her, sputtering. Arwyn tapped her foot as she glared at them. 

"Sit," she said, pointing.

The two scrambled out of the muddy puddle her magic had left and settled on dry ground, Lum sitting cross-legged and Calix kneeling. 

"That's our sis," Lum whispered to the dragonkin. "Her elven side makes her soft, but she does have dad's fire deep inside."

"Be quiet, Lum." Arwyn sat down before them and took a deep breath. "We've come a long way in our search, Calix. Please tell us your story."

Calix pursed his lips and looked away. "There isn't much to it. They say my father saved the village from the Great Serpent, but he left before I was even born." His clawed fists clenched. "Mother still gets that stupid dreamy look in her eyes when she talks about him. I don't understand why she isn't angry. I wish I could meet him and say a few things to his face."

"Oh, Calix. We're the same." Arwyn reached out to grip his hand. "Do you know where he went next?"

Calix nodded slowly. "Mother says he set off south. To the Oaken Groves."

"The dryads," Arwyn murmured with dawning realization. "I have a hunch you won't be the last half-sibling we meet."

Lum barked a laugh. "A great man should have great appetites."
