"Here are your kombuchas," Jack said, setting down three glasses. "Enjoy and call me if you need anything else."

"Now, don't run away yet," Hermes said, reaching for his glass. "What's this I hear about you quitting?"

Jack's practiced smile wavered. "You know I've been thinking about it for a while."

"Is it the pay?" Apollo asked in a concerned voice. "I'll bring more of those gold coins mortals are so fond of."

"It's not that," Jack assured. Exchanging the ancient coinage the gods tipped him in was a pain, but it was insanely valuable. "See, I always wanted to get a degree..."

"If it's a subject under my jurisdiction," Athena interjected, "I would be happy to tutor you every now and then."

Apollo nodded seriously. "And if not, I'll ask grandfather Coeus."

Jack opened and closed his mouth several times. "Coeus," he said weakly, "as in the Titan of all knowledge?"

Apollo just chuckled. "I wouldn't say *all*, but he is the wisest of us all."

Jack swallowed, then shook his head. He couldn't let them convince him *again*. "Listen, I appreciate the offer, I really do, but I can't work as a waiter forever. I'm pushing thirty-five, and as nice as this gig is, I feel like I have to do something more with my life while I still can."

The gods exchanged confused looks.

"Well, why didn't you say so!" Hermes exclaimed. "I'll get Ganymede to bring you some ambrosia. A good swallow ought to last you a century or two."

"Ambrosia," Jack muttered. "You'll give me *ambrosia* just so I would keep working here?"

"Sure," Athena said. "You're the best waiter this place ever had."

Jack sighed and rubbed his forehead. He wasn't sure whether he was the luckiest person in the world or the exact opposite.
