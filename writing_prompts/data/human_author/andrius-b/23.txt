A lone knight in plate armor scarred by countless battles stood atop the cliff, his visor raised, his hand resting on the hilt of his sword. Before him towered a magnificent dragon, its coal-black scales gleaming in the sun. Even though the dragon dwarfed the knight, its enormous head was bowed in respect.

"I don't think you understand, beast," the knight said warily. "Squires must obey not only the king's laws but a strict code of honor if they're ever to become full-fledged knights."

"So be it," the dragon said. "I will learn your codes. I will obey."

"You would have to defend the kingdom against invaders," the knight said, "as well as other foul beasts that would threaten the citizens."

"A life without the thrill of battle would be a poor life indeed," the dragon replied, sounding pleased.

The knight shook his head. "You wouldn't be able to hunt in the king's forests as you did before," he said. "Everything you consume, you would have to pay for."

The dragon gave a rumbling laugh. "I have hoards of gold that I know many of your kind seek to get their grubby hands on."

The knight tilted his head up to stare the dragon in the eye. "Your words ring true, yet I do not understand. I know your kind is proud beyond any other. Doesn't it rankle, to have to obey human law?"

The dragon grumbled, releasing a puff of smoke. "Let me tell you a story, human, a story few of my kind remember. Eons past, we lived on a continent that has no name in your tongue and ruled all under the sky. Then a great calamity sundered the earth, releasing flames and smoke that was to ours as a candle is to the sun. The forests and the meadows died, and with it died our prey. Even the most powerful of us aren't immune to hunger."

The knight listened with bated breath, suspecting it to be a story never heard by human ears.

"And so we perished under the ash-filled skies," the dragon continued. "But some, just a few score, gathered the last of our strength and set out across the endless ocean. For weeks we flew, and many lost strength and were claimed by the waves. But the last dozen reached these lands, and we have lived here since. I was one of them, although I was but a youngster then, flying in the slipstream behind my sire."

The knight swallowed. "That would make you over a thousand years old."

"Half again that," the dragon said with amusement, "but I did not tell this story to boast. Don't you see? Those who lacked imagination to set off for unknown lands, those who could not adapt to the changing world, they perished. Those who adapted, dared to do something none of our kind had done before, survived."

"And what, pray tell, does that have to do with you seeking squireship under my guidance?" asked the knight.

"The world is changing again. Mighty as we are, we fall to your sharp swords and clever tactics one after another. Those that lack imagination will perish." The dragon gave him a blood-chilling grin. "I intend to adapt."
