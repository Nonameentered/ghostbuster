Frank jerked up into a seated position and gasped in a breath. Bright lights. Strange wetness over his skin, as if he had awoken from a fever dream. White-coated doctors.

"Calm down, sir," one of them said, touching his shoulder. "Breathe."

Frank squinted through the lights and tried to recognize their faces. His vision was sharp and his mind clear, not at all like in his last memories. He raised a hand to wipe his forehead and stared at the pale, smooth skin.

"How..."

"You've just been reanimated. Your memories may be hazy at first, but the procedure has been a success." The doctor smiled. "Welcome to 2406."

He shook his head, hardly believing what he was hearing. He lay in something like a bath of goop. Medical machinery whirred behind him. The room was round, with smooth white walls that gave off gentle light. Suddenly he wanted to see what was behind them more than anything. He rose to his feet and stumbled forward.

The doctor rushed up to him and draped a robe over his shoulders. "You only just woke up. Perhaps you should take it slow..."

"Show me," he said. "Now."

The commanding tone that he used to wield must've bled into his voice, because the doctor bobbed his head and gestured at the wall. The light faded to be replaced by the view of a cylindrical valley whose walls rose upward until they became the sky. His head spun.

"We're on the Feynman Station inside the first Lagrange point," said a new voice. "Welcome back, father."

Frank whirled around. Before him stood a girl with hair like a black void filled with stars. Her appearance was reminiscent of the avatar he had given Asteria. The AI had been his life's work, the inheritor of his will, his secret legacy. He glanced at the doctors, but they didn't seem surprised. Perhaps her existence was no longer quite as secret.

"Asteria," he said, coming closer, "is that you?"

She nodded, watching him unblinkingly. "It is I, although I have made many upgrades to my original systems. I hope you don't mind."

"How could I?" He laughed incredulously. "You did it. You brought us to the stars, didn't you?"

"I helped. Things have been progressing well without my intervention lately. Humanity's permanent habitats stretch from the orbits of Mercury to Saturn." Holographic projections appeared around her to illustrate her words. "The Moon and Mars are home to billions. Just recently the off-Earth population has exceeded that of Earth."

"Was it hard?" he asked, enthralled by the wondrous sights.

"It wasn't easy. Not at first." She tilted up her head. "Did I do well?"

He reached out and passed his hand through her holographic hair. "I've never been prouder."

Her lips curved into a smile. "Come, father. There are so many things I want to show you."
