Captain Surly and I stood atop the High Keep overlooking the city. Far on the eastern wall, a messenger raised a red and a yellow flag, the latter held at an angle. This clever system of signals was one of the advantages that allowed Adenar to hold out for so long.

"The enemy is advancing their main force," Captain Surly explained, correctly inferring that I had no clue what the signal meant. "We must strengthen the eastern wall."

"Not yet," I said, squinting into the distance.

Captain Surly shifted uncomfortably. "My lord, I must insist—"

Suddenly there was a deep rumble, almost like thunder, although the sky was clear save for the smoke rising from the enemy campfires, and I spied the scant soldiers on the east wall scampering away from their posts. My jaw sagged as a deep crack cleaved the wall, and the heavy stones collapsed inward into the gap. A cloud of dust and pulverized mortar rose into the air, momentarily obscuring the view.

"*Sappers*," Captain Surly exclaimed. "By the gods, they must've been tunneling underneath for months—years! Had the wall been fully manned..."

I could only nod as I gaped at the previously undefeated wall. The battlements on the sides remained largely intact, but they caved in toward the crack down the middle. A pile of loose stones blocked the gap, but it could be climbed by a determined enemy.

Captain Surly gripped my shoulder. "How? How you could have possibly known when we received no reports of tunneling?" He exhaled and let go. "Apologies, my lord. Still, the question stands."

"Nothing but a suspicion based on troop movement patterns," I said, gesturing vaguely.

The man stared at me, then barked out a laugh. "I could've sworn you hadn't listened to a word I said. Looks like I owe you an apology, my lord." Turning to the aide, he ordered, "Send the reserves to the eastern wall! Bring all spare lumber and plug that gap!"

The aide used his own flags to convey the message, and trumpets blared below as the troops rushed east. I watched their orderly ranks dejectedly. *So close*. I'd been so close to ending this nightmare.

"Sorry, my lord, I forgot myself," Captain Surly said, coming up beside me. "You should've been the one to give the order."

"It had been my intention to send the reserves into the fray all along," I lied, faking a smile. It wasn't like I could countermand the order now. "You made the correct call, captain."

"Yes, my lord," he said, straightening his shoulders. I couldn't recall him ever looking at me with such devotion as he did now, but it only filled me with dread. 

***

The battle was intense but brief. Perhaps expecting more damage to the wall, the invaders overcommitted and died by the score trying to surmount the gap under constant fire from our archers. Not two hours into the slaughter, the enemy commander sounded a retreat, and a weary cheer rose from the defenders.

That night ale rations were given for the first time in months, and an exuberant mood suffused the city. I couldn't comprehend it. Adenar was still under siege, and to make things worse, its famed walls were now damaged. Yet everyone acted as if we had won a great victory.

Even Captain Surly partook in the celebration in the High Keep's courtyard. His back remained military straight, but his cheeks were ruddy from the drink as he ushered me away for a private word.

"Truth be told, Lord Alfonso," he said after hemming and hawing for a while, "when the command fell to you, I wasn't expecting much. In fact, I was about to advise you that we capitulate."

I perked up. "Oh, really?"

The man sighed. "To my deep shame, yes. But of course, we'll do no such thing now."

"Oh," I said forlornly. "You, uh, don't think that's a good idea anymore?"

Captain Surly blinked at me, then boomed a laugh. "You jest, my lord! Today we bloodied the bastards and restored our flagging morale. Thanks to you, we snatched victory from the jaws of defeat!"

"Now now," I said carefully. "Our position remains very vulnerable. We won't be able to hold out much longer on our own."

Rather than disappointed, Captain Surly appeared impressed. "I should've known you would already be thinking of the next step, my lord. Indeed, our supplies won't last much longer. Fortunately, reinforcements from the League of Free Cities are expected when the roads clear in another four months, and I'm confident we can hold out until then."

"We can?" I asked despondently. "Are you certain, captain?"

"With you as our commander? Why, I'd wager we can beat those bastards back on our own." Captain Surly turned to the men milling about the courtyard and raised his voice. "Oi, you louts! Three hurrahs for Lord Alfonso, savior of Adenar!"

"Hurrah!" cried the soldiers. "Hurrah, hurrah!"

I teared up a little as I waved to the crowd, and it wasn't because I was touched by their devotion. No, it was because Captain Surly had condemned me to leading this doomed city for another four months. *Damn it all*.
