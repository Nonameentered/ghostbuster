Ruldrim found himself restless in his sixth century of age. The surrounding forests provided all the prey he could eat, the nearby towns paid him tribute, and he had amassed a respectable hoard in his lair. What he didn't have was a challenge. So, in a long-standing tradition, he decided to kidnap a princess and battle the bravest knight of the land for her.

He left his mountain and flew across the realm until he came upon a beautiful palace. As luck would have it, a bevy of maidens were having tea out in the garden. Ruldrim intended to observe from above to determine whether there was a princess among them, but upon spying a glint of gold on one of the maidens' necks, his instincts took over, and he swooped in and seized her.

She screamed and squirmed in his claws. "How dare you, beast! I am Princess Annabelle of the Istibore Kingdom, and I order you to put me down this instant!"

Ruldrim perked up at his great luck. "Hear me!" he roared at the guards rushing out of the palace. "If you want your precious princess back, come to my mountain and fight me!"

He rose to the skies and flew home, daydreaming about the great battle he was going to have. The princess in his claws kept screaming threats. Amusement rumbled in his chest. Her lot was to serve as the lure that drew the best warriors of the realm.

Arriving at his mountain, he glided into his lair and gingerly set the princess down. She stumbled a little, then promptly rounded on him and pounded his leg with her tiny fists.

"You ugly brute!" she cried. "My brothers will send the kingdom's army to rescue me, just you wait!"

"That will make for a worthwhile battle," Ruldrim said, pleased.

"I will order them to cut you apart and make a couch out of your hide! You..." She trailed off, staring at the lair's back. "Oh... Oh, my. Is that all gold?"

He chuckled. "Gold, silver, gems. Only the best in my hoard."

The princess hurried past him, sank her hands into a pile of gold coins, and let them spill from her fingers. When she glanced back at him, there was a calculating gleam in her eyes. A shudder went through Ruldrim's massive body, although he couldn't quite understand why.

Shaking off his unease, he curled up for a nap by the lair's mouth. Through his drooping eyes, he saw Annabelle rifle through his hoard, exclaiming at one treasure or another. At least she wasn't screaming anymore.

"You. Hey, you. Wake up, stupid beast!"

Ruldrim snorted out a puff of smoke and cracked open his eyes. During his brief respite, the princess had bedecked herself head to toe with dazzling bracelets, brooches, and rings. Her hands were planted on her hips, and she was glowering at him.

"I'm hungry," she declared.

"Very well," he said, rising to his haunches. "Will a deer suffice?"

"A *deer*?" she scoffed. "Do I look like some lowly woodsman? I want honey-glazed quail and mawmenee and sweetmeats."

He tilted his head. "Where do I hunt for this... mawmenee?"

She laughed condescendingly. "Silly beast. It is something you cook, in the kitchen."

"I'm a dragon," Ruldrim said. "I cannot cook."

"Then go to the nearest town and bring someone who can," she said, crossing her arms. "The commoners will do your bidding if you just toss them some gold."

"What's wrong with a nice juicy deer?" Ruldrim asked irritably. "Humans eat them too."

"No!" she cried, stomping her foot. "I don't want no stinking venison! I want peaches with cream and marzipan cakes!"

She looked up at him with upturned eyes and sniffled. Ruldrim stared back at her, nonplussed. Her face twisted, and covering her eyes with her hands, she broke into heaving sobs.

He shifted uneasily. The princess only cried louder. Her cheeks were flushed, and tears were trickling down her cheeks. 

"Very well," he said grudgingly. "I shall find you a cook."

"Y-you will?" she asked, wiping at her eyes.

He sighed. "Yes, yes. Just cease this horrid wailing."

"Oh, thank you!" She gave him a watery smile. "Sorry I called you stupid. I'm sure you're doing your best."

Relieved by her change of mood, Ruldrim wheeled around and flew to the nearby town. Its denizens were used to seeing him, so his appearance didn't cause a panic, although it took some explaining before he found a stout middle-aged woman who agreed to cook for him in return for one gold coin a week. Ruldrim hated the expense, but it had to be done. It wasn't like Annabelle would stay for long.

The cook brought along an assortment of pans and did her best to prepare a meal upon a fire Ruldrim lit, serving it upon the golden dishes from his hoard. The princess griped about lack of tablecloths and candles, but polished off the meal and appeared content. For a brief moment, that is.

"Dragon," she said, snapping her fingers. "Attend me."

Ruldrim grumbled under his breath. "What now?"

"I'm tired."

"I too am weary. Let us rest until the knights come for you."

She heaved a sigh. "Must I spell out everything? It's all well and good for a beast like you to sleep on cold hard rock, but I need a bed."

He ground his teeth. "I shall bring you a bale of straw."

"I don't want no prickly straw! I want a silken bed—with curtains, so you won't ogle my beautiful skin!"

"Ogle your..." Ruldrim shook his head, stung by the absurd accusation. "You'll just have to make do without."

She sniffled, tears pooling in her eyes.

"I won't change my mind even if you cry."

That gave the princess pause. She tapped her foot, studying him with furrowed brows. "If I don't get a silken bed—why, I'll die before tomorrow!"

"*Die*?" he exclaimed. "Do humans die if they don't sleep in beds?" He glanced at the cook.

"Princesses do," Annabelle said with conviction. She glared at the cook, who swallowed and nodded.

"Curses," Ruldrim muttered. This princess kidnapping business was more complicated than he thought. "Well, I better visit the town again. Please don't die before I return."

The princess gave a long-suffering sigh. "I'll do my best."

The business at the town went smoother this time, and Annabelle got her bed as well as a promise from the carpenter to come by and build her more furniture. Ruldrim glanced ruefully at his hoard, then curled up and fell asleep to dream of knights in gleaming armor and glorious battle.
