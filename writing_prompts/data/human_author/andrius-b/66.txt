Finn hummed along to the elevator music as he pondered the strange anxiety niggling in the back of his mind. He prided himself on being logical, but try as he might, he couldn't make sense of it. He had a good life and a stable career. He was single, but only because he had been so swamped with work he didn't have the time to date. What was there to be dissatisfied with?

The elevator opened to the underground garage. Sighing, he walked to his car. Perhaps he would schedule another appointment with his therapist. Things always started making sense after a session with her.

He started the car and began pulling out of the parking spot only to swear and hit the brakes when a woman in a leather jacket jumped out in front. Killing the engine, he got out of the car.

"Jesus, are you all right—"

"Oh, Finn." The woman pounced and embraced him tightly. "I finally found you!"

His arms rose to hug her back before he caught himself. Her flowery perfume evoked a feeling of familiarity, yet he was certain he had never met her before. "Miss? You must've got the wrong person."

She let go and looked up at him. "What the hell are you... Oh, no. They wiped you too."

"*They*?" He shook his head. "Never mind. Listen, I see that you're not injured, so I'll just be on my way."

"Wait!" She grabbed his elbow. "Finn, please look at me. It's me, Heidi. Don't you remember at all?"

He turned around reluctantly. She was blonde, fit, and dressed like a biker. A heart-shaped face framed by blonde hair, and blue eyes with a steely glint. Something about her made his pulse quicken. "I don't," he murmured, rubbing his forehead. 

She sighed. "I should've known. So who do you think you are now?"

He eyed her warily. "I'm an accountant," he said. "Not that it's any business of yours."

Heidi gaped at him, then erupted in laughter. "No, wait, I'm sorry," she said, raising a hand. "They really did a number on you, didn't they? An *accountant*!"

His expression soured. "It's a good career," he repeated the words he had been telling himself for weeks. 

She chortled. "And do you enjoy it?"

He opened his mouth, then closed it. "Does anyone like their job?" he said at length. "It pays the bills. Now, if you'll excuse me..."

"Your birthday's on May 13," she rattled off. "You prefer dogs over cats, you drink black coffee without sugar, and you insist on having cereal for breakfast every day."

He stiffened, then fumbled for his phone. "Have you been watching me?"

"And you have a birthmark the shape of a diamond on your right—"

"How did you know?" he blurted out.

Heidi gave him a saucy wink. "I've seen it up close." She looked around the garage, and her expression grew serious. "Listen, we might not have much time. Take this."

She reached under her jacket, pulled out a pistol, and tossed it to him. Finn yelped in alarm but caught it in time. He turned it over, his fingers closing around the smooth handle with strange familiarity.

"What am I supposed to do with it?" he asked in confusion.

She rolled her eyes. "What else? You've always been the better shot."

He chuckled mirthlessly. "I never held a gun in my life."

"Oh yeah?" She looked him over thoughtfully. "How about I prove that you have?"

A sly grin curved her lips as she took several strides back. Reaching behind, she pulled a thin sword. Finn's eyebrows rose. A sword was ridiculous in this day and age, but in her hands, it did look threatening.

Her grin widened. "Look alive!" Raising the sword, she lunged at him.

Finn stumbled back but caught himself before he would fall. His fingers seemed to move on their own as they flicked off the gun's safety and took aim. The woman froze with the gun's barrel aiming squarely at the middle of her chest.

"There you go," she said, not batting an eye. "Your mind might not remember, but your body does." She sheathed the sword and snickered. "An accountant, *really*."

Finn lowered the gun and tried to control his breathing. "What... what am I, then?"

"I'll tell you on the way." She circled his car and settled in the passenger seat. "You drive."

He looked around, swallowed, and took the driver's seat. "Where are we going?" That they were going at all was no longer for debate.

"Where else?" she said, giving him a strange look. "To get your memories back."
