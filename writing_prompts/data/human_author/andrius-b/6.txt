Peter, Lyle, and Sarah huddled on the couch, their eyes fixed on the screen of Sarah's phone. Playing on it was real-time footage of the city's most notorious supervilainess, Grey Shifter, robbing a bank. Clad in a skin-tight suit of smart superalloy, she was making short work of the security robots, drawing ever closer to the vault.

"I don't know," Peter said.

"I'm telling you guys, it's her," Sarah said, her eyes glowing with excitement. "Look at the way she moves. That little tic of hersâ€”look!"

She rewinded the video. Shifter formed a superalloy claw and slashed a robot in half, then shielded her face from the ensuing explosion. Before continuing on, she lifted a hand to her ear as if to brush back an imaginary strand of hair.

"Huh," Lyle said slowly. "She does look like Alice, a little."

"I don't know," Peter repeated.

Sarah rolled her eyes. "Well, I do. Think back. Was she ever at home when Shifter was out doing supervillain stuff? And she's so tight-lipped about her work." She smiled gleefully. "Like she has something to hide."

"Okay, so let's say she is Shifter," Peter said skeptically. "What do we do then?"

That gave Sarah pause. "What do you mean?" she asked, lifting her eyes from the screen.

"She's a villain," Peter said slowly. "We're, like, obligated to turn her in to the police."

The three of them exchanged looks. 

Sarah turned her attention back to her phone. "Well, we don't know for sure, right?"

Peter didn't point out that she had been certain of it just moments ago. He understood. Alice was awesome. Quiet, meticulously tidy, and she cooked the best biryani he had ever tasted.

On the screen, Shifter formed claws on each of her hands and bent forward to cut through the hardened steel of the vault door. Lyle leaned closer to watch.

"I'm not turning her in even if she is Shifter," he declared.

Sarah snorted. "You're just saying that 'cause she looks hot in that costume."

"I mean..." Lyle glanced at Peter, who shrugged in agreement.

"Okay, yeah, she does," Sarah conceded, watching Shifter wriggle into the vault through the hole she just cut. "But that's not the point. She's like, the nicest and tidiest person I know."

"Doesn't want to leave evidence," Peter speculated. "DNA and such."

"Do we care why?" Sarah countered. "And she's never late with rent. She even covered for me a couple of times."

"Well, yeah." Lyle gestured at the screen, where Shifter was escaping with a superalloy sack of loot slung over her shoulder. "She's not exactly short on cash."

"That she steals from banks," Peter said.

"Whatever she does, she's the best damn roommate we could ask for," Sarah said. "What if we chase her out and get another Todd in her place? You guys remember Todd?"

The three of them shuddered. 

"I try not to," Peter muttered.

The screen switched to the bank's main hall. Shifter ran for the exit, only to skid to a halt when a muscular hero in a purple cape flew in to bar her way. The two faced off in silence for several seconds before the battle was joined.

"Yeah!" Sarah cheered as Shifter's claws tore through the hero's cape. "Kick his ass!"

"Wouldn't you normally cheer for the good guy?" Peter said with amusement.

"You want her to be able to pay rent this month, don't you?"

Peter shrugged. "Point."

They watched Shifter wallop the hero with her sack of loot. As he staggered back, she tossed a globe at his feet, and smoke swallowed the entire screen. Once it cleared, there was no sign of the supervilainess.

Sarah sighed. "I wonder if she's in the market for a sidekick," she murmured, then laughed at the incredulous looks the other two sent her. "Just kidding."

The three were still watching the ensuing news coverage and arguing about Shifter's identity when they heard the front door open. They exchanged wide-eyed looks while Sarah swore and quickly hid her phone. A moment later, Alice walked into the living room with a slight limp.

"Hey, everyone," she said brightly, then frowned at them three sitting stiffly on the couch. "What's up?"

"Nothing," Sarah said, springing to her feet. "How, uh, how was work?"

"Ugh, it was hell," Alice groaned. "There was this particularly pesky customer that I couldn't get rid off for ages."

"I'll say," Peter muttered.

Alice glanced at him with faint puzzlement. Sarah sent him a dirty look, and taking her by the shoulders, led her to the table.

"You poor girl," she said. "Let's get you something to drink, and you can tell me all about it."

Lyle suddenly leaned forward. "Look," he hissed, pointing at the back of Alice's head.

Peter's eyes widened.  Stuck in her tousled black hair was a long, thin strap of purple. He cleared his throat.

Sarah glanced back and followed their gazes to the fragment of the cape. Leaning back, she quickly pulled it out. Lyle ran up to take it from her and tossed it into the trash. When Alice glanced back at him in surprise, he grinned and pulled her a chair.

"Here," he said, "you must be tired."

"Seriously, what's going on?" Alice asked, a little nervously. "You guys are acting strange."

"We just want to show you how much we appreciate you." Lyle grinned. "And we were kind of hoping you would cook for us tonight." 

"Is that all?" Alice said, laughing. "You should have just said so. I love cooking."

Sarah flashed Lyle a thumbs up and drew Alice into a conversation to distract her. Peter sighed and slumped back on the couch. It appeared they would be harboring a supervillainess for the foreseeable future.

Still better than rooming with Todd, to be fair.
