The royal guards escorted Will outside the palace grounds and gently but firmly pushed him out into the street. He was so stunned that he walked on without resisting. He had been summoned to a fantasy world by accident—a mere test of a ritual for summoning the true hero that would take place in three years. At least the sorcerers had been awfully polite about it. The coin pouch in his pocket was filled with enough gold to let him live in comfort for several years.

As he walked deeper into the bustling city, his lips slowly stretched into a smile. An elven bard was fingering a lute under the eaves of a tavern, and a pair of wolf-eared folk were arguing about the price of beef with a butcher. Incredible. This was so much better than his dull existence back on Earth.

Sure, the sorcerers said he was entirely ordinary, but who was to say he wouldn't awaken some cheat skill later? And even if he didn't, he still had his superior knowledge. He had read enough isekai stories to know how easy it would be to impress the locals with a piece of Earth's technology. Why, he might even get a harem of otherworldly beauties.

A female cry from a narrow alley broke him out of his daydream. Will blinked at the squat wooden buildings around him; in his distraction, he had wandered into a shabbier part of the city. The people here wore rough clothes and had cold looks on their faces. No one spared the alley the cry had come from a glance.

Will swallowed and turned the corner into the alley. An ugly, balding man—clearly a thug—was pressing a black-haired catgirl against the wall and leering at her.

"Help!" she cried, spotting him. "Please help me!"

Will knew then that it was fate itself that brought him here. "Let her go!" he demanded, although the effect was diminished by his shaky voice.

The thug sneered at him. "This is none of your business. Leave before you get hurt. "

He scowled and raised his fists. "I said, let her go!"

The thug laughed and approached Will. His hands trembled but he stood his ground. Rearing his arm, he punched the thug in the stomach with all he had. The impact didn't feel all that hard, yet the thug staggered back and clutched his stomach.

"You'll pay for this!" he wheezed, and limped off along the alley.

Will stared at his retreating back, then at his fists. Could fighting be this easy? Perhaps he had some hidden power after all.

The catgirl pounced and enveloped him in a hug, dislodging all thoughts from his head. "You saved me! My hero!"

"I—yeah, of course," Will said breathlessly. "As a man, I couldn't just turn a blind eye to a beautiful maiden in trouble."

She pulled back and toyed with a strand of her black hair. "You're such a sweet-talker. My name is Nala. Tell me, handsome, how can I repay you?"

He smiled as his gaze unconsciously wandered over her skimpily dressed figure. "Maybe... you could show me around the city? I'm new here."

"That I can do." She tapped a finger against her lips. "Are you hungry? There's an inn nearby that serves great food."

Will swallowed as he realized he hadn't eaten for hours. "Starving."

"Perfect. Follow me then." 

She attached herself to his arm and pulled him out into the street. As they walked, she pointed out the landmarks and prattled on about the city. Will smiled as he listened with one ear. Yes, this was how it was supposed to be. Fate had great things in store for him after all.

Soon they arrived at the inn, where Nala got them a table in the corner and ordered a platter of meat and a bottle of wine. 

"Please, drink," she purred, pouring him a gobletful. "It's my thanks for saving me."

Will took a sip. The wine was sour and watery, not at all like back on Earth, but Nala was looking at him so expectantly that he swallowed it and smiled. "Delicious."

Her ears perked up. "I'm glad you liked it. Here, have some more."

One bottle turned into three, and the wine didn't seem to taste quite as bad anymore. Nala hung on to his every word as he alternated between telling her stories of his former home and boasting about the adventures he would have. Before he knew it, the two of them were climbing upstairs, her supporting him by the shoulder. They stumbled through the door, laughing, and her deft fingers undid the buttons of his shirt. The last thing he recalled was her fanged grin as she pushed him onto the bed.

Will awoke slowly to sunlight spilling through the ajar shutters. His head pounded, and his mouth tasted like someone died in it. He tried to raise his hand to rub his gummy eyes and couldn't.

His head jerked up. He lay on a shabby bed dressed in nothing but his pants, his wrist tied to the bedpost with a rope. The room was empty. No beautiful catgirl, and certainly no pouch filled with golden coins. 

Will's stomach sank, and he collapsed onto the bed with a groan. "That wasn't how this was supposed to go!"
