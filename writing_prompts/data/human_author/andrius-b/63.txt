His feet pounded the pavement, his breathing loud in his ears. Every time he glanced over his shoulder, there she stood, an impossibly pale woman with hair that billowed despite the stillness of the night air. The streets were empty and dark. In his panic, he ran without looking and ended up in an older district he had never set foot in before.

He rounded a corner. An old family home loomed at the end of the street, its gate ajar. It was the last place he wanted to seek shelter, but the ghost cackled behind him, sounding closer than before, and he sped toward the gate. His heart sank when he saw the state of the garden inside. It must've been spectacular at some point but was now overgrown with weeds. The place must've been abandoned.

The ghost giggled and rasped something. Desperate, he ran toward the dark house. Crashing through the door, he fumbled for the light switch and laughed in hysterical relief when the lights came on, tearing a wooden-floored hallway from the darkness. 

He glanced back at the door. The ghost must've been scared by the light because she was nowhere to be seen. He crept down the hallway and ducked into the nearest room, hoping to find something to use as a weapon. The lights worked here too. He stepped inside, looking around warily. The place was cleaner than expected, almost lived in.

Something rustled behind him. He whirled around, only to freeze when he came face-to-face with the ghost. She hung upside-down from the ceiling, her long hair brushing the floor and her mouth set in a toothy smile.

"Welcome," she said.

He recoiled. "Aaaaaargh!"

Laughing, she flipped over and landed on the floor without a sound. "Oh, that was so much fun! I could never move like that when I was still alive." She looked him over and frowned. "Hey! Did your mother never teach you to take off your shoes when entering someone's house?"

"W-what?"

The ghost planted her palms on her hips. "Your shoes! You're tracking mud into my room."

"Er..." He gaped at her ethereal form, gulped, and stooped to take off his shoes. If he played along, maybe she would let him go. "I'm... sorry?"

"That's better." She doubled back to close the door, not so much walking as floating, then returned to him. Her eyes, black like the abyss, pierced his. "Now we can begin. There's a reason I brought you here. I know you're a kindred soul."

He shuddered and took a step back, but she floated even closer. Although ghosts should have had no need for air, she seemed to be panting. "Iâ€”I don't understand."

"What is there to understand?" She smiled, and the tips of her hair curled up like dozens of black snakes. "I'll play with you all night and not stop even if you die."

He stumbled backward and fell on his behind with a cry. The ghost bent over him, her pale face glowing with hungry excitement. He whimpered and shielded his face.

She pushed something hard and plastic into his hand. His fingers closed around the vaguely familiar object, and he cracked open his eyes and blinked. A PlayStation controller.

Sighing wistfully, the ghost sat down cross-legged beside him. "Not finishing this game is my greatest regret. The co-op version is meant to have a different ending, but no one wanted to play with me while I was still alive." She tilted her head at him. "You'll play with me, right?"

He bobbed his head, too cowed to object.

She smiled and faced the screen. "I knew it; I saw you play games at night. Here, you can be player two."

As they played through the night, his fear gradually faded. He did die a lot at first, and she would complain and batter his shoulder with her translucent fist, but eventually he got the hang of it. They finished the game just as the rays of the dawning sun started filtering through the blinds.

Silvery tears trickled down the ghost's cheeks as she watched the cutscene. "It's as good as they say," she sniffled.

"Yeah," he muttered, watching her more than the screen. "You... You're not going away?"

"Going away?" She wiped her eyes with the back of her hand. "Why?"

He shrugged uncomfortably. "You said it was your biggest regret. I just thought..."

"Oh. Come to think of it, you're right." She stared at her hands, then smiled at him. "I guess I had so much fun tonight I don't feel like passing on yet. There are so many games I didn't get to try while I was still alive."

He sighed. "I get it." With everyone at work staying overtime lately, he hardly had the time for it.

The ghost fidgeted with her fingers. "Would you play with me again?" she asked, sending him a sideways glance. "I can't manifest very well during the day, but you can drop by any night."

He considered her for a time. "Yeah," he said slowly. "I'd like that." 

The brilliant smile she gave him was no longer one bit scary.
