Admiral Solari stared at the tactical display which showed the fleet fanning out to engage the incoming raiders. His focus wasn't so much on the impending battle as a single corvette: CORV-B-65536, a standard Alliance model like hundreds of others on the fleet. The trouble was, until it had pinged headquarters five minutes ago, he hadn't even known it existed. More incredibly yet, neither did the computers.

Solari turned as his aide walked into the bridge. "Well? How come there's a ghost ship on my fleet?"

The aide glanced down at the tablet in his hands. "I've looked into it more deeply, and apparently there's been some kind of a glitch at the manufacturing facility. Their count was off by one. The tactical computer registered the extra once you scrambled all units because that command bypasses the normal communication channels."

Solari swore as he returned his attention to the screen. The facility that produced ready-for-battle ships complete with a cloned engineer had been controversial to say the least. If word got out that it fabricated extra clones without putting them on the payroll and ensuring timely retirement, the public outrage could spell the end of the program.

Squaring his jaw, he jabbed his finger at the corvette and dragged it to plot a new course.

"Sir?" the aide said nervously. 

"I just went ahead and fixed the glitch," Solari said.

The aide shifted on his feet. "The ship is on a direct collision course with the raiders."

"I'm aware," Solari said, looking at the screen with grim satisfaction.

The aide swallowed. "You'reâ€”you're sacrificing it?"

"Well, just a second there, Phil. I'm only fixing the glitch. The corvette's not on any of our databases, so it will just work itself out naturally."

The men watched in silence as the CORV-B-65536 rushed to meet the dozens of red icons on the display, then winked out.

Solari nodded. "There we go. Problem solved on our end."
