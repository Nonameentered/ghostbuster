The wizard threw his arms skyward and chanted in a harsh, guttural tone. Black clouds of malice erupted from his hands with furious screeches, only to slowly dissipate. A shocked look crossed his face, and he chanted the incantation anew. The result was much the same. The warrior stood there and watched with grim amusement.

"This cannot be," the wizard muttered. "I am a master of Dark Magic! How could my spell fail?" He threw his arms up again.

The warrior scratched his scarred cheek. "Please stop, this is getting awkward to watch. Your magic works fine."

"It does? But then why..." The wizard's eyes widened. "You have no loved ones? *None*?"

"That's right," the warrior said, raising his sword. "Can we get back to our battle now?"

"No, wait, I can't wrap my head around this," the wizard said, raising a palm. "How can you have no one at all?"

The warrior sighed. "I spent my life hunting down one evildoer after another, and my scars don't exactly make me approachable. In the last village I visited, the children ran off screaming."

"Damn," the wizard said. "You need to take a break and meet some new people. Not everyone judges by appearance alone."

The warrior shook his head. "I can't believe I'm being lectured by an evil wizard."

"Hey, I might be evil, but even I have people I care about. Some of my lieutenants aren't entirely hopeless, and I have a good thing going with the Barbarian Queen..." The wizard snapped his fingers. "You know, the barbarians consider battle scars honorable. I bet they'd help you change your outlook on things."

The warrior lowered his sword. "I don't know... You *did* try to kill all my loved ones."

"*You* were the one who assaulted me," the wizard said. "I was only minding my own business."

"Point." The warrior hesitated before sheathing his sword. "You really mean what you said?"

"I wouldn't lie about something like that," the wizard said, coming closer. "Come, I'll introduce you to some nice folk."
