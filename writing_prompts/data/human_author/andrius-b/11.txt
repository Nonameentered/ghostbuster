The Reaper recalled well the first appearance of the Child. When the first man passed outside the bosom of the Earth, in a mechanical monstrosity revolving around it, he came to collect their soul as he always did. The Child had stood at the head-end of the bed and watched him without a word. Dressed in an overly large suit, he would have looked comical were it not for the somber look in his blue eyes. The Reaper swung his scythe and led the soul away, unsettled but implacable.

From thereon the Child hounded his steps. Always standing in opposition, never moving a finger or speaking a word, curiosity and sadness mingling in his eyes. It was clear that the Child was one of the Powers That Be, a new one judging by his youthful appearance, but of his purpose the Reaper knew nothing.

Time passed, and they found themselves standing on the opposite ends of a machine that looked nothing so much as a casket with a frosted window. Inside lay a woman whose soul he had come for. The portholes on the wall showed a distant blue speck that was Earth. Humans had made another step in their quest for the stars.

The Reaper began to raise his scythe, but the Child gripped his bony wrist and shook his head.

"She isn't dead," he said. "Just sleeping very deeply."

The Reaper tried to free his wrist and found that he couldn't. "Who are you to stay my hand?" he asked, more shocked than angry.

The child made a thoughtful expression. "You could say I'm your opposite."

The Reaper shook his head. "Her heart no longer beats," he argued. "Even if it did, her disease has no cure."

"By the time they wake her up, there will be one." The Child interspersed himself between the machine and the Reaper and spread his small arms. "I'm not letting you take her."

The Reaper would've laughed were it not for the look of utter conviction on that childish face. "So be it," he said. "But don't stand in my way again. You cannot stop me."

"Not yet." The Child smiled an almost mischievous smile that made him look like an innocent boy. "But one day I'm going to put you out of your job, old man."

The Reaper shuddered and glided off into the shadows, feeling the Child's solemn gaze on his back.
