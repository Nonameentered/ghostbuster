While the other students filtered out of the lecture hall, Peter and Sarah put their heads together and stared at his phone. The former saw Alan and waved him over.

"Check this out," he said excitedly. "I found a video of the parasite wasp the professor mentioned."

"Ugh, it's so gross," Sarah said gleefully.

Alan rolled his eyes and came over. On the phone's screen, a small spider swayed in its web. A wasp landed on its back and stung it, making its hairy limbs twitch briefly. He blinked, then leaned closer, his breath quickening.

"They say the larva takes over its body," Peter said. "Makes it build a special web to protect it. Freaky, right?"

"Yeah," Alan said, licking his lips. The sight seemed to resonate with him strangely.

"Look, it's laying eggs now," Peter said with morbid fascination.

"I can't watch," Sarah cried, still peeking from the corner of her eye.

"That's so hot," Alan whispered. "Infect that host, baby."

Peter choked out an incredulous laugh and looked up. "What?"

"Huh?" Alan said, shaking off his reverie.

"Dude," Sarah said, sending him a strange look. "You're drooling."

He lurched back and hurriedly wiped his chin. "It's nothing. Justâ€”just a fascinating video, is all. Later, guys." 

He bid a hasty retreat, feeling Peter's and Sarah's gazes on his back. What the hell had happened? One thing he was sure of, there was something seriously wrong with him.
