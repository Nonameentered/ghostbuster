She steps out of a pillar of flames, and her nostrils flare at the smells of blood, smoke, and viscera. A battlefield! Inhaling the sweet scent of mortal suffering, she casts her gaze about. Her summoner lies at her cloven hooves, pale and trembling, clutching his guts with one hand and pressing the other's index finger to a summoning circle in the dirt. 

She clicks her tongue. He clearly isn't long for this world, which means her enjoyment will be brief.

"What is your desire, mortal?" she asks, turning up her nose. 

He looks up and gives her a watery smile. "Someone to be with me until I'm gone."

"To be with you?" She hums thoughtfully. "Shall I seek the enemy who maimed you and bring them here so you can watch them bleed out?"   The idea perks her up. Maybe this mortal can entertain her after all.

The man shakes his head frantically. "That's not what I meant! Just stay with me." He slumps back on the muddy ground, his strength fading. "Please... It won't be long, I can feel it."

What a spiritless fool! She wants to scream in contempt, but instead, she irritably bats away an incoming arrow with her wing and sinks to her knees beside him. "If that's what you want." A short stint in this plane is better than nothing, she supposes.

He smiles faintly and reaches for her hand. She squirms in discomfort and turns aside so she wouldn't have to see that doltish expression.  Her gaze lands on the rudimentary summoning circle in the mud. No bindings, no safeguards... Of course, the idiot didn't have the time. 

The corners of her lips quirk up as a powerful realization rushes through her. His wish is the only limitation of the contract. *To stay with him until he's gone*. 

Freeing her hand from his, she presses it to his bleeding stomach and unleashes her power. Unholy flames burst from her fingers, knitting flesh, restoring organs. The man doubles over and screams in pain, then slumps back. He pants for air, his face slowly regaining color.

"You... healed me?" He sits up and prods his stomach in disbelief. "But that's impossible! The First Interdiction—demons can't extend your lifespan—"

"Not as a bargaining chip, no," she says triumphantly. "Had you asked me to save you, I would've laughed in your face and watched life fade from your eyes. But since you didn't... well, let's just say I decided to help you of my own free will."

"But *why*?" he asks. "Aren't you creatures of utter selfishness?"

"Oh, how adorably clueless." She stands, yanks him to his feet, and looks him over critically. Not too hard on the eyes, although in bad need of a bath. "You wished me to stay with you until the end. As long as you're alive, I get to enjoy myself in your plane without any limits to my powers."

His face pales again. "Oh, no."

"Oh, *yes*." Her lips part in a fanged smile that makes him shiver. "You're going to live a very, very long life at my side. Now tell me, who is waging this war and what's your place in it? It's been so long since I wet my claws with mortal blood."
