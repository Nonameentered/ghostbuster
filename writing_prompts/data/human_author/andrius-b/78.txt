He feared she would laugh at his crazy scheme, toss the bottle aside, hell—simply refuse to drink it. Yet she only gave him a sad look, uncorked the bottle, and swallowed the potion in several gulps. He searched her face, but her eyes remained the same bright blue as always. Perhaps there wouldn't be an obvious change.

"I'm yours now," she said quietly. "What will you have me do?"

He shook his head. "I don't understand."

"Don't pretend," she said with sudden vehemence. "I'm under the potion's influence, so speak your mind, *my love*. What do you want me to brew? What enemies of yours shall I curse?"

"Please," he said, clasping her hand in his. "I only wish to be with you."

She laughed mirthlessly. "What would a man like you want with me? I'm no fair maiden. My hands are scarred, my hair is bleached by the fumes, and everyone says my powers come from the devil."

"Yours are beautiful hands," he said intently, tracing a burn scar with his fingertips. "When plague struck the village, you nursed the sick tirelessly. When old carpenter's wound spoiled and the physician left him to die, you saved him. And I've seen you sneaking in at night to leave food for the village's poor—"

"You saw me?" she asked, alarm crossing her face.

"I must confess that I've been watching you for months," he said, "and a kinder and nobler person I've never known."

"Your words are sweet." Color tinged her cheeks, and she ducked her head. "Do you truly mean them?" she asked timidly. "Are you certain you wish to be with someone like me?"

"I have no doubt in my heart," he whispered, tipping up her chin to look her in the eye. Then he glanced ruefully at the empty bottle. "I just wish..."

She stood on her tiptoes and pressed her lips to his. "I have a confession too," she breathed, blushing brilliantly. "Witches are immune to love potions."
