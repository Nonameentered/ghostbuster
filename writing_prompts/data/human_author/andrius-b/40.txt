Nebeus shifted on his mountaintop perch and suppressed a yawn, struggling to focus on the ramblings of the emissary. At some point during the past century, the local humans had taken to worshiping him. He neither encouraged nor dissuaded them from the practice. As bothersome as it was to listen to their droning praises, the cattle and the barrels of spirits they brought in tribute were always welcome.

"...And the Cult of the Blackest Night continues to terrorize the eastern provinces," the emissary was saying. "Not a month ago they sacrificed yet another innocent village to the flames of Nox Atra—"

Nebeus started, causing pebbles to roll down the slope. "Nox Atra?"

"A false god," the emissary spat. "A dragon said to be black as the night, yet unseen for centuries—the cult hopes to summon him using their dark rituals."

Nebeus exhaled a puff of smoke through his nostrils. A coincidence, surely. It had been centuries since he called himself by that name, and human memories rarely lasted that long.

"I see you burn with the same anger as we do, O mighty Nebeus," the emissary said. "Dare I ask whether you will unleash your flames upon these evildoers?"

"What? Oh—anger, yes." Nebeus cleared his throat and put some somberness into his voice. "Thank you for bringing me this grave news. I shall investigate the cult."

The emissary bowed and erupted into a litany of thanks. Ignoring him, Nebeus scrabbled up the slope, spread his wings, and took to the skies. 

A coincidence. It had to be.

He rose swiftly and winged toward the Burning Lands. A journey that would take humans and their horse-drawn carts days along their winding roads was barely enough for him to properly stretch his wings. The land below steamed and bubbled and occasionally erupted in gouts of boiling water. The lake of tar from his memories had diminished but still lay there like a black scar upon the land.

Nebeus landed by the shore, his claws sinking into the soft ground. Even though he knew no one would venture this deep into the Burning Lands, he couldn't help glancing around in embarrassment. Still, he had to know. He waded into the tar and reluctantly coated his glimmering golden scales in black. 

Emerging from the lake, he shook off the excess tar and checked his reflection in a nearby pond. Had he been a human, the sight of his dark past staring back at him from the water would have surely brought a blush to his cheeks. As it was, he only shuddered and quickly averted his gaze.

He took to the skies, high above the clouds so that even the most eagle-eyed humans wouldn't see more than a speck, and set course to the eastern provinces. Despite his heavy wings, he made good time, his anxiety driving him to go faster.

A great pillar of smoke rising from below drew him like a beacon. He spiraled lower and eyed the ground. An entire town had been brought to the torch, and in a cobbled square at its center, a great pyre smoldered, emitting the stench of burning human hair. Dozens of black-robed figures surrounded the pyre, chanting and gesticulating.

Nebeus sniffed derisively; leave it to humans to find foolish reasons to slaughter each other. He folded his wings and dived toward the square, braking at the last moment.

The black-robed cultists erupted into exultant screams. Nebeus's three hearts raced when he heard yells of "Nox Atra" among them. His worst fears were coming true.

He cast his gaze over the cultists. As one, they fell to their knees and prostrated themselves, only increasing his unease. A spindly man carrying an ironbound tome crawled closer and raised his arms toward him in supplication.

"We greet you, Nox Atra the Blackest Night," he cried ecstatically. "The Dark Flame of Annihilation, the Merciless Extinguisher, the Eater of Worlds!"

Each successive title sent a shudder of mortification through Nebeus's great body. "Stop," he exclaimed. "That's enough!"

The man cringed. "Does our sacrifice displease you, O mighty Nox Atra? We worked tirelessly in the night to please you so you would emerge from your slumber in the Blackness Between Worlds—"

"How?" Nebeus demanded, raking the cobblestones with his claws. "How do you know about the—the"—his thunderous voice dropped to almost a murmur—"the Blackness Between Worlds. And the other stuff."

The black-robes exchanged glances. The spindly one bobbed his head and reverently lifted the ironbound tome. "It's all in this book, O Flame of Annihilation. Your lowly followers recorded your previous descent upon the world to the last letter."

Nebeus shrank back. "T-to the last letter? That must be an exaggeration, surely."

"We wouldn't dare speak falsely, O Extinguisher of All That is Holy. Everything you ever uttered in the presence of others is written here." The cultist cracked open the tome and raised his voice. "And on the last day of Quintilis, a great pain overcame Nox Astra, and he cried thus: 'My dark power overflows! I must suppress it lest it destroy creation itself—'"

"No, no, no," Nebeus moaned, staggering backward. This couldn't be happening. "H-how many records are there?"

"This is the only Black Tome in existence, O Dark Flame of the Blackest Night," the cultist declared proudly. "Copies are forbidden. Through the ages, it has been passed from the hands of one Keeper to the next, biding time until your Black Flame descends once more."

"Thank the stars," Nebeus muttered. "Er, excellent work. I'm most pleased."

Not waiting for an answer, he beat his wings and took to the skies. The cultists cheered, but the cheers turned to agonized screams when he inhaled deeply and belched out a torrent of flames. He spewed flame until all was silent and the thrice-cursed book was but ashes, then made a last circle above the town, and satisfied winged his way back west.

A boy in black robes rose from under the rubble inside a burned-out husk of a home, his keen eyes committing the horrific spectacle to memory. With trembling hands, he raised a stick of charcoal over a sheet of sooty parchment and began penning the tale of Nox Astra's descent and the punishment He delivered upon the untrue believers.
