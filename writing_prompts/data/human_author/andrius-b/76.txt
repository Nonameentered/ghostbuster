Noah descended into the basement and crouched before the plate. As usual, not a crumb remained of yesterday's bread. He set down a fresh loaf, dusted the flour off his fingers, and rose. Around him lay cardboard boxes stuffed with old clothes, a broken lawnmower, and shelves housing dad's old tools that mom never threw out. Noah had searched the place dozens of times while she was at work, yet he never saw anything out of the ordinary.

Someone had to live here, right? Like a dog or a cat, or maybe a ghost. He wasn't sure which was more exciting. Mom always became strangely upset when he asked her to let him keep a pet.

"I hope you like it," he said. "Mom put in cranberries this time. I don't like 'em, but maybe ghosts do. They don't taste so bad in bread, I guess."

He trudged upstairs. Mom was cleaning up in the kitchen.

"Did you set out the bread?" she asked.

"Yeah," he said. "Hope the ghost likes it."

"Ghost?" She shook her head. "Don't be silly, dear."

"If it's not a ghost, then what is it?"

"Nothing you need to worry about," she said sternly. "Go play outside."

He scampered out of the house and ducked under the front window. Footsteps fell down the hallway, and the lock on the basement's door rattled. Noah peeked through the window to see where mom hid the key. Even if it was a ghost, maybe they could become friends. 

***

That night Noah waited for mom to give him a goodnight kiss, then grabbed a flashlight and a comic from the drawer in his desk. He lay still for another half an hour until he heard mom open the door of his bedroom and peek inside. After she was gone, he read his comic under the covers until his wristwatch showed midnight.

Hardly believing his daring, he slipped out of bed and tiptoed downstairs. The house felt different at night, and the darkness seemed to hide something sinister. He held out as long as he could before he flicked on his flashlight. The bright beam tore the shadows away to reveal only the old armchair, the ironing board, or his blue jacket on the coat rack. 

Emboldened, he sneaked into the kitchen, dragged a chair under the top cabinets, and climbed it to rummage inside. Mom was always careful not to be seen when she used the basement key, but it was a lousy hiding place.

Key in hand, he tiptoed to the basement door. Here he paused and wiped his sweaty hands on his T-shirt. Up till now, he had done nothing that would warrant more than a scolding. But if he opened this door—why, mom would ground him *forever*. That was the most important rule. Don't ask about the basement. Don't talk about it outside. Never, ever go down there without permission.

Noah drew a bracing breath and stuck the key into the lock. When it didn't turn, he was almost relieved, but then it suddenly *did* and the lock clicked with a noise that seemed to reverberate through the house.

He froze and listened. A minute passed, then another. He wanted to be back in his bed, but some stubbornness inside him made him open the door. The stairs stretched down into impenetrable darkness. He aimed the flashlight down and squared his shoulders. Whatever the basement hid, he would get to the bottom of it.

He crept down, shivering at every creak of the stairs, and halted at the base. The flashlight revealed dusty shelves and boxes and an untouched loaf of bread on the plate. Noah laughed nervously. Maybe this was all a prank. Maybe mom sneaked downstairs every morning before he woke up and hid it.

Maybe he would catch her at it tonight.

He looked for a hiding place and squeezed in between two large cardboard boxes. He rummaged inside one until he found an old blanket and fashioned himself a little tent. Proud of his cleverness, he turned off the light and settled down to wait.

Time passed slowly, and he started wishing he had brought his comic. The darkness wasn't very scary anymore, not in the safe nook he had built. He brought his knees to his chest, yawned, and rested his head against the cardboard.

He must've nodded off, because when he next jerked his head up, there was drool on his cheek. A scraping noise filled the basement, like nails against concrete, but it sounded muffled, and he couldn't place its direction. He swallowed, not daring to move.

The scraping paused, only to be replaced by a grinding noise. Through the gap between the boxes, Noah saw one of the shelves swivel open. From the blackness emerged a dark figure, and it made that horrid scraping noise with every step. Noah's hand tightened on his flashlight but he was too scared to turn it on and see what the darkness hid.

The monster shuffled to the plate and bent over it. A loud chomping sound came. Then the monster straightened up and hummed a lullaby mom always used to sing to him when he was younger.

"Yummy," the monster murmured in a rasping voice. "It's so yummy, mommy."

Noah gasped. *Mommy*?

"Who's there?" The monster's feet scraped the floor as it turned. 

He clamped a hand over his mouth, his heart racing. The monster shuffled closer, sniffing the air. Noah backed away between the boxes until he hit the wall. There was no escape.

"Who's there?" the monster called, much closer now. "Please come out and play with Clara."

He panted, gathering his courage as the footsteps drew ever closer. Slinging off the blanket, he sprang to his feet and turned on the flashlight with a furious cry.

The monster hissed and shielded its face with its overly long arms. A ragged dress hung from its gangly frame. *Hers*, Noah realized incredulously—she was a girl, although like no girl he had ever seen. Her back was hunched yet muscular, her shoulders were set too far forward, and her thick fingers ended in enormous curved nails.

The monster lowered her arms and squinted at him. What little of her face he could see under her scraggly black hair was strange too: eyes set too far apart, bulbous nose, and an enormous mouth full of crooked teeth. Her skin was so pale he could see blue veins beneath.

"You're so pretty," she whispered. "What is your name? Mommy said it was polite to give your name."

"N-Noah," he stammered.

"Can you make the light go away, Noah? It hurts Clara's eyes."

He slowly turned the beam aside. She smiled, revealing far too many teeth. Noah gulped and edged out of his nook, but she stood between him and the stairs, and he didn't dare get any closer.

"Who... who's your mommy?" he asked, dreading the answer.

"Mommy lives above," she said reverently. "She gives Clara yummy bread every night."

He shook his head as if to deny the obvious. "Why are you living down here?" 

"Because Clara's bad. Clara used to be good. Clara lived with mommy and daddy and liked doggies and kitties very much." Although she gazed right at Noah, she didn't seem to see him.

He licked his lips and started edging around her. "I like doggies too," he said to distract her.

"Mommy once brought Clara a doggy and it was pretty and soft and Clara petted it a lot." Her hands flexed, and her nails scraped against each other. "But then the doggy broke, and mommy and daddy got angry and said it was Clara's fault."

Noah swallowed. "I... I'm sorry."

She didn't seem to hear. "Daddy said Clara wouldn't get a new doggy. Clara got angry, and daddy got angry and hit Clara, and Clara wanted daddy to stop, and then daddy broke." She howled so suddenly that Noah jumped. "It's not Clara's fault! Clara doesn't want to be bad!"

"Y-you're not," Noah exclaimed, pressing his back against the wall. "It wasn't your fault!"

Clara's eyes focused on him as if seeing him for the first time. "Noah's hair is so pretty," she cooed. "Clara wants to pet it."
