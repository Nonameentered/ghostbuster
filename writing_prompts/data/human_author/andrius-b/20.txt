Rowan sat down behind the bar and parted his cloak to display the token hanging from a chain around his neck. Blythe, bless her, immediately filled up a tankard of ale and set it before him.

"Still alive, old timer?" she asked. "Here to take a new job?"

"In a moment," he grumbled, picking it up. "Let me wash down the dust in my throat first."

He took a sip and cast his gaze over the dusty inn. The Iron Dagger was a place where men with gold came to get their problems solved, as well as a place for weary bounty hunters to take a break. It was one of the many such places scattered across the country, grudgingly tolerated by the king. Their reach and reputation were just that great. Rowan could say without a hint of bragging that he had contributed to that reputation. With twenty years under his belt, he had claimed countless bounties and had the scars to show it.

He took another sip and frowned, tilting his head. A rhythmic noise came from outside, like the thumping of an enormous drum, steadily growing louder. Then came the alarmed shouts. 

Rowan set down his tankard and swiveled to the door just in time to see an enormous scaly head burst inside. Swearing, he drew his sword.

"Stand down," Blythe cried, waving frantically. "Razorwing's not an enemy."

*Razorwing*? He froze in surprise. The dragon squeezed deeper in, its head sliding past Rowan on a sinuous neck, but the doorway proved to narrow for its shoulders. It rumbled in irritation and squeezed its front leg inside with a noise of cracking wood. Bringing it closer, it raised it before Blythe. Rowan gaped. From its claws dangled an Iron Dagger token much like his own.

"It is done," the dragon rumbled in a voice that shook the walls. "The Linden Bandits are no more."

"Well done," Blythe said matter-of-factly, although Rowan could see her gripping her apron so hard her knuckles went white. "Any collateral damage?"

The dragon released a puff of smoke. "Not much. A fire—a *very* minor one—the locals extinguished it easily. No harm done."

Blythe sighed and unlocked her strongbox. "I keep telling you," she said as she deftly piled golden coins onto the counter, "you have to be more considerate of the surroundings. It's not just your pay on the line but our reputation."

The dragon snatched the coins with its claws and carefully deposited them into a leather satchel hanging around its neck. "I'll be more careful. It's just that your buildings burn so easily."

"I have a perfect job for you, then." She rummaged behind the bar and resurfaced with a piece of parchment. "Redbeard, a notorious pirate, has been terrorizing the Southern Straits. No one will mind if you torch a few of his ships. Will you take the bounty?"

The dragon turned to squint at the parchment with a giant golden eye. "I shall. The Straits are but an hour's flight away." His forked tongue flicked out. "May I have a drink before I depart?"

Blythe nodded with obvious reluctance and heaved a barrel of ale onto the counter with a grunt. The dragon gripped it gently with its scaly mouth, tilted its head back, and sucked the drink dry in enormous gulps.

"Ta, Blythe. I'll be back with news of Redbeard's demise." It glanced at Rowan, frozen stiff with his sword in his hand. "Comrade," it rumbled with just a hint of sarcasm, and wiggled out of the inn. There came that thumping which Rowan now recognized for the beating of enormous wings, and the doors slammed shut from the wind.

Rowan sheathed his sword and reached for his tankard with a trembling hand. At the last moment, he changed his mind and pushed the drink away.

"Tell me it's not your drink making me see things."

"My drink has nothing to do with it," Blythe said. "Razorwing came to ask to be inducted three months ago and has been hunting bounties ever since. He's proven highly efficient"—she grimaced—"if sometimes overly enthusiastic."

Rowan shook his head incredulously. "Never mind how efficient he is! You just accepted a bloody *dragon* into our ranks?"

She snorted. "Would you have had the stones to look him in the eye and tell him his services weren't welcome, old timer?"

"Fair enough." Slumping on the stool, Rowan took a long draught of his ale. 

"What about you, then?" she asked. "Going to take a new job?"

Rowan opened his mouth, then closed it and shook his head. "Competition's heating up," he muttered. "I was thinking it's high time I retired."
