"Grandma, grandma!"

Cornelia sighed, raised her eyes from the yellowed pages of *Celia Maledictus*, and directed her best glare at her daughter's spawnling. The brat only grinned. Blonde and pink-cheeked from running around the house, he did not seem afraid of her in the least. Must be some flaw of the mind he inherited from his father.

"No," she said firmly.

"But grandma," the brat protested, "I haven't even said anything!"

"I don't need to hear it. No, I won't play 'Lego' with you. No, I won't read you a storyâ€”if you're not capable of reading by yourself at that age, I'd wonder whether you're my daughter's blood at all. And I certainly don't want to see your inept drawings."

She returned her attention to the book, yet the brat wasn't deterred. Scurrying up to the couch, he climbed onto the armrest and squinted at the pages of *Celia Maledictus*. His gaze slid over the writing and landed on a sketch of a cauldron surrounded by three practitioners.

"Is this a cookbook?"

"Nothing as mundane as that," Cornelia scoffed, incensed. "It is a treatise on the Craft which your mother would've learned had she not run off and shackled herself to a *man*."

A frown knitted the brat's forehead as the concepts proved too complicated for his inferior mind. To think her wayward daughter had turned her back on the Craft for *this*.

"Grandma, I want cookies," he said out of nowhere.

She sent him an incredulous look. "Well, *I* want to be left alone, yet here we are."

The brat pouted. "Josh's grandmother always makes cookies when I come over."

"Then perhaps you can visit her and stop pestering me," she retorted.

"Don't you know how to make them?"

She froze, then slowly turned toward him. "Are you implying that I, Cornelia the Terrible, First of the Penburn Circle, don't know how to bake cookies?"

"Well?" he said with a note of challenge. "Do you?"

"Do I? *Do I*?" With a groan and a creak of her knees, she rose to her feet. "You little rascal, just you wait! I'll make cookies so delicious you'll keep eating them until your stomach bursts!"

The insolent child cheered and scampered to the kitchen. Cornelia shook her head as she followed, leaning heavily on her cane. The nerve! She had been baking things that would make his hair curl before he was but a twinkle in his nitwit father's eye!

She tried to recall a good recipe as she entered the kitchen. A love potion or a curse she could whip up with her eyes closed. Cookies, however...

The brat looked up at her, bouncing on his feet in excitement. Well, no matter. How hard could it be?

"Where's your pantry?" she barked.

"Here, grandma!" The brat pointed at a large overhead cabinet.

Cornelia used her cane to pull open the door and cast a critical eye over the ingredients. "Fetch me the flour, and some sugar, and salt, and cocoa, and a pinch of henbane."

The brat pushed a chair up to the cabinet and obediently retrieved the ingredients. "I think we're out of henbane, grandma," he said, eyeing the pantry shelves with a frown.

Cornelia clicked her tongue. "What is my daughter thinking, not stocking a staple? Never mind, get down before you break your neck and fetch me some butter and eggs."

The brat did as asked. Cornelia started on the dough, grumbling under her breath. In one bowl she combined the dry ingredients, and in another she tossed in the butter and softened it with a murmur. She threw in a handful of sugar and wiggled her gnarled fingers, causing a fork to beat the mixture together.

"Where do you get these eggs?" she asked suspiciously, lifting one to her ear.

"The supermarket," the brat answered.

"Bah! They're not freshly laid, I can tell you that." 

She cracked the egg into the bowl with the butter and sugar. The brat stood on his tiptoes, trying to peek over the counter. Cornelia snapped her fingers, causing the fork to cease whisking. Since the brat was there, she might as well put him to work.

"Mix this up," she said, combining the contents of the bowls. 

The brat pushed his chair closer so he could reach the counter and started mixing so enthusiastically that he got flour all over his hands. How odd; not a peep of complaint like she expected. She watched him for a spell until he looked at her in question.

"That's quite enough," she said gruffly. "Now where's your oven?"

The brat wiped his nose with the back of his hand and pointed. She shuffled over to the contraption and pulled out a baking sheet.

"Where are the matches?" she grumbled, looking around.

The brat giggled. "You don't need matches, grandma. It's electric."

Cornelia glowered at him until he looked properly chastised. Laying the baking sheet on the counter, she ordered the brat to roll the dough into balls. He did so with great enthusiasm if not much skill.

"Anyone ever tell you you're a lot like your father?" she asked.

The brat beamed. "Yeah, loads!"

"Wasn't exactly a compliment." She waved off his confused look. "Get on with it already."

Once the cookies were formed, the two of them loaded the sheet into the hot oven. The child immediately crouched and pressed his nose to the glass. Cornelia absently waved her cane, causing the dirty bowls to float into the sink, and peered over his shoulder.

The spawnling turned to her seriously. "They don't look right."

Cornelia sniffed, although she privately agreed. "Go wash your hands," she snapped. "They'll turn out fine without you staring at them."

He nodded and bolted out of the kitchen. Cornelia bent over the oven. The cookies weren't rising and looked a sorry sight indeed. Must be the newfangled electric oven; unnatural is what it was.

She looked left, then right. Grinning slyly, she muttered an incantation and gave the oven a *thwack* with her cane for good measure.

It was just in time, because she heard the child's footsteps outside. She shuffled to a chair and settled down to wait.

The entire kitchen gradually filled with a mouthwatering aroma. When Cornelia pulled out the sheet fifteen minutes later, the cookies had well-risen, cracked domes, and the smell was such that an unscrupulous practitioner of the Craft could have used it to lure lost orphans into her hut.

The brat reached up, and she yanked away the sheet.

"You'll burn yourself," she chided.

He swallowed, shifting impatiently on his feet, and Cornelia had to turn away to hide her satisfied smile. Must be getting sentimental in her second century.

"Can I have one now?" he pleaded hardly a minute later. "Oh, can I?"

"Go on," she grumbled. "Just eat slowly."

The brat grabbed a cookie and greedily nibbled on its end. His eyes widened. "Wow! These are way better than Josh's grandma's!"

Cornelia sniffed. "I should think so."

"Thanks so much, grandma!" He ran up and hugged her.

She froze, then slowly hugged him around his little shoulders. "You're welcome, child." Perhaps her grandson had a certain pathetic charm about him after all.
