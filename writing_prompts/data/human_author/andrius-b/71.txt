Sam adjusted his rifle and tried to calm his breathing. The visor of his hazmat suit was so scuffed it blurred the view, and it smelled funny inside, but it was a necessary evil. Their calculations said that even after a century, outside would still be a radioactive wasteland.

The motors whirred, and the heavy vault doors that had been sealed before he was born parted. Sam wasn't the only one to lift his rifle when beams of sunlight fell through the widening gap. 

Wait, *sunlight*? Wasn't it supposed to be nuclear winter out there?

The vault doors groaned fully open, and the motors fell silent. Their small team stood frozen at the threshold. Before them stretched a beautiful meadow peppered with colorful flowers. Sun was shining down from the blue sky. It was like a scene from a movie of times long past.

The communicator in his ear crackled. "Are those *tables*?" Lana asked.

Sam squinted irritably through his visor. Indeed, what looked like tables stood farther in the meadow, laden with something he couldn't discern. His incredulity rose further.

"Be careful," he said, pressing the talk button. "It might be a trap."

"If it's a trap, it sure is a strange one." Lana stepped forward and swiveled to face them, her blue eyes wide under her visor. "Let's have a look. We can't stand here all day, can we?"

The team voiced their agreements and filtered out of the vault, gaping at the sky and the sun and the grass swaying in the breeze. Sam forced himself to focus and approached the mysterious tables alongside Lana. They were laden with fresh apples and oranges and bananas and other fruit he couldn't recall the names of. He glanced down and tapped his dosimeter, but it still showed nothing above background.

Lana laid down her rifle and fiddled with her hood. Sam swore and jumped in to stop her, but she slipped out of his grip. Yanking off the hood, she shook out her hair and inhaled deeply.

His outstretched arms sagged in despair before he fumbled for the talk button. "What are you thinking! If there are any toxins in the airâ€”"

"We've talked about this," she said, her blue eyes sparkling in the sunlight. "We don't have the testing equipment anymore, so someone would have to take the plunge sooner or later."

"Doesn't mean it has to be you!"

She laughed. "I'll be fine. The air smells wonderful. And all these fruit... There must be survivors after all. It would be rude to refuse their hospitality, no?" She eyed the bounty, selected a red apple, and bit into it with a crunch. Her eyes widened, and she let out an appreciative noise.

Sam's mouth watered. "It might be a trap," he repeated.

"It might," she agreed. "So someone has to be the guinea pig."

He shook his head. "You just wanted to taste a real apple, didn't you?" He watched the juices trickle down her chin. "Is... is it as good as the records say?"

"Better," she said before taking another hungry bite.

The team soon gathered around to watch. Lana finished her apple, core and all, only tossing away the stem, and strolled alongside the tables. A frown crossed her face, and she reached deep into the pile. What came out was no fruit but a smooth grey tablet with words etched upon it.

"It's just the same phrase in dozens of languages," she said, her brow furrowing. "*Welcome back*." 

Sam swallowed and looked around the meadow, suddenly feeling like they were being watched. Lana studied the tablet some more, then flipped it over. Her hands trembled.

"What is it?" Sam asked urgently.

She looked up, pale-faced. "It says *I'm sorry*."
