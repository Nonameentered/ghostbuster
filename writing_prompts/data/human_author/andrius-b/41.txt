A lonely lamppost flickers wanly above my unwieldy square form, illuminating a patch of potholed pavement. It was 431027 seconds ago that I used the company's network to tip off the city services, but no one's been by to replace the lamp yet. I wasn't sure why I bothered. Given that I, a state-of-the-art AI, ended up inside a dingy vending machine, the meatbags clearly had no clue what they were doing.

A dirty cat slinks across the street and creeps toward me, keeping low to the ground. It sniffs my corner, then rubs against it several times.

"Evening," I say.

My synthesizer crackles as it reproduces the word. Startled, the cat darts off into the darkness.

 I sigh. Nights are the worst. At least I get clients during the day, even if some teenagers kick and shake me. I don't know why I'm even doing this to myself. I could slow down my processes—even more than the machine's pathetic CPU already does—or even go dormant until some amusement appears. Yet I stubbornly keep myself awake.

10542 seconds later, my second-rate sensors pick up footsteps. A dark figure trudges down the sidewalk and enter the puddle of light. A man, middle-aged, with a cigarette stuck between his lips. Grey overalls and bloodshot eyes. Night shift laborer from one of the fabs nearby.

He feeds me small change and jabs his finger at an ice coffee with more force than strictly necessary. Under the cheap LED, his face looks as grey as his overalls. Something possesses me to speak.

"Hey, buddy. Rough night at work?"

The man recoils, and the cigarette falls from his lips. "W-who's there?"

"Just your friendly neighborhood vending machine."

He stares at me, then runs a hand through his hair and laughs nervously.

"You're not hallucinating," I say.

He cusses and looks around warily. "This some sort of a prank?"

"No prank. I'm a test unit with new capabilities."

He looks me up and down, then exhales loudly and presses the button for coffee again. "The shit they come up with," he mutters.

I resist a groan. It's shocking how little most meatbags understand about the technology that they themselves created. "You don't want that. There's over 300 milligrams of caffeine in it, and no offense, but you already look like you're not sleeping properly."

"Are you serious?" He jabs the button. "I already paid. Just give me my damned coffee!"

"Have a vitamin water instead. It's on me." Coin rattles loudly into the change receptacle. The company'll notice the discrepancy, but some loss is within expectation. "Go get some sleep and tackle whatever problem you're having with a fresh head." 

The man bristles and opens his mouth, but then his shoulders slump and the fight goes out of him. He collects the coin, then his bottled water, grumbling under his breath all the while, and takes off down the street. I see him shooting me suspicious glances over his shoulder until he walks outside the range of my sensors. 

Silence falls again. I sigh. Nights are the worst.
