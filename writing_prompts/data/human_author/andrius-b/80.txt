Seven people gathered around the circular table in the situation room at the Flying Fortress—six of Earth's strongest and wisest heroes and *him*. Maven steepled his hands to prevent them from shaking and concealed his mounting panic behind a well-practiced thoughtful expression.

Athena planted her hands on the table. "You all saw Destructo's transmission. His antimatter bomb will destroy the planet in twenty-four hours unless the heads of the top superheroes are brought to him." She clenched her fists. "*Our* heads."

"The transmission had the effect he desired," Tinkerer said, pushing up a pair of glasses whose lenses crawled with tiny letters and images. "The world's in turmoil. Some are already demanding us to sacrifice ourselves."

"If I could trust Destructo to keep his word," Castle boomed, "I would lay down my life for the planet any time."

Maven eyed him incredulously. He had thought Castle only spoke like that before the cameras, but it seemed the guy was just touched in the head.

"In the end, our best bet is to find and disarm the bomb," Athena said. "Tinkerer?"

"I have drones scanning for antimatter containment signatures around every location Destructo had been active in," Tinkerer said, her eyes darting restlessly. "But it's like looking for a needle in a haystack. If only we had some sort of a hint..."

"That's why I invited the Maven." Athena inclined her head to him. "I know you prefer to operate independently, but we could really use your insight right now."

Maven shifted in his chair as six pairs of eyes centered on him, full of respect and misplaced hope. "We must consider all angles," he said slowly.

Four of the six nodded as if he had said something profound. Asclepius's eyes glazed over as he stared into the distance.

"But what does that mean?" Castle asked, frowning.

Maven felt sweat erupt on his palms. Perhaps the guy was just too simple to be affected much by his ability. "Sometimes," he hedged, "the answer lies in the last place we look."

Castle scratched his head. "Uh..."

"Maven?" Athena said, almost timidly. "Could you explain in more detail?"

"Bah," Asclepius interjected, as surly as ever. "He obviously means our search is going in the wrong direction. Why do you youngsters need every little thing explained?"

Maven smiled vaguely and mentally offered the old man his fervent thanks. That was as good an interpretation as any.

Tinkerer gasped and straightened up in her chair. "Of course! What's the last place we would look for the antimatter bomb?"

The six exchanged stumped looks.

"Destructo's old lair?" Castle said.

Asclepius snorted. "Too obvious."

"Antarctica?" Athena asked, glancing at Maven for confirmation.

"*Hmm*," he said thoughtfully. It sounded good to him, but before he could say anything more, she spoke again.

"Never mind, I'm a fool," she said, slapping her forehead. "The bomb's powerful enough to annihilate the planet, so remote locations are the *first* place we'd look."

"The Capital City?" piped up Flash.

He waited, but no more guesses were offered. "Villains' minds work in strange ways," he said, spreading his hands. 

Tinkerer projected a holographic keyboard and typed furiously. "I'm sending more eyes to the Capital. ETA twenty minutes."

Maven slouched back in his chair. Outwardly he projected confidence, while inside he was praying for Flash's guess to be correct. The Capital City—why not. It sounded as likely a location as any.

Minutes crawled past. The superheroes occasionally tried to draw him into conversation, but he deflected each attempt with some obscure statements, and eventually they left him alone. People generally preferred to pretend they understood his supposedly profound words over asking him what he meant and thus admitting their ignorance.

Tinkerer hissed in a breath, her eyes focused on something only she could see. Her fingers froze, then danced on the keyboard with alacrity.

"What?" Castle demanded, half-rising to his feet. "What is it?"

"Let her work," Asclepius grumbled. "There will be time to smash things."

Maven held his breath, his heart hammering against his rib cage.

"It's *there*," Tinkerer breathed. "I wanted to double-check, but there's no mistake—the bomb's under the First Hero Memorial!"

Maven's facade broke for a moment as he let out a relieved groan, but no one heard him over the sound of Castle's chair clattering to the floor.

"All right! As soon as we disarm it, Destructo's got an appointment with my fist!" He lumbered up to Maven and slapped his shoulder. "I had my doubts at first, but you're as good as they say."

"Thank you so much," Athena said, her eyes shining with admiration. "Can we call upon you again?"

"No!" He coughed at the strange looks the others sent him and schooled his voice. "There's no need for that, is there? You are all very capable. Even now, it was you who did all the work."

"We couldn't have possibly figured it out without your guidance," she protested, and the others murmured in agreement. "What if there's another crisis?"

Maven regarded their hopeful expressions and knew he couldn't refuse. "Only if it's something you can't handle," he said grudgingly. "I don't like to be disturbed from my ruminations."

He feared he had laid it on too thick, but everyone just nodded, looking almost apologetic. He shook their hands as they filtered out of the room, and once he was alone, he collapsed back into his seat and rubbed his temples. 

Good lord, he needed a drink.
