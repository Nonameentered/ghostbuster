"It's going to be fine," I say, clutching Lati's hand. "They're good people."

She gives me a nervous smile. "I know. I hope they'll like me. I hope... they won't notice."

"Nah. You look perfect." 

I peck her on the cheek and ring the bell. Footsteps sound behind it, and my parents open the door. They look my girlfriend over, and I start to think their gazes linger on her too long, but then they smile, and I sigh in relief.

"Come in, come in," mother says warmly. "You must  be Hulalotl. What a pretty name—Mexican?"

"Thank you, ma'am—that's right—you can call me Lati. All my friends do, and you're my friend, I mean, I hope you are," Lati babbles. 

I hear a rustle of feathers, a sure sign that she's losing control of her form, and squeeze her hand to calm her down. My parents don't seem to notice. They invite us inside and make small talk, and when we sit down at the dinner table, my sister wanders in, dressed in her usual sharp black suit and still wearing her sunglasses.

"Sorry I'm late," she says, shrugging off mother's admonishments.

She introduces herself to Lati and seats herself opposite her, tapping the frame of her sunglasses with a thoughtful frown. Lati squirms in her seat.

"At least take those off at the table," mother chides.

Sister shrugs, takes them off, and looks away from Lati at last. We make small talk—how we met, where did she go to school, and such—and all seems to go well. 

Until my father, the klutz that he is, trips over the hem of his ceremonial robes as he's bringing a tray of refreshments, and they soar in an arc toward the table.

I instantly know I'm witnessing a catastrophe. Lati shifts in the seat beside me and extends her hand, and several black wings covered with razor-sharp feathers erupt from the sleeve of her dress and catch every single glass before they can fall. 

There's a second of stunned silence before all hell breaks loose.

Mother draws a gleaming dagger whose blade glows with runes. Father makes a warding gesture and begins to chant. Sister leaps away from the table and pulls a deceptively small blaster from her suit. 

"I knew her readings were strange," she says with grim satisfaction.

"Sorry, I'm sorry, this is just—I only wanted to help," Lati babbles, and her wings tremble so much that the drinks she caught slosh over the rim of the glasses.

"Cut it out," I say, stepping in between her and my family. "You're being rude."

Father cuts off his chant and exchanges a glance with mother. "You knew?"

"Of course I did," I scoff. "We've been going out for half a year. Do you think I wouldn't have noticed that my girlfriend has eldritch blood?"

"Oh." Mother smiles sheepishly and sheathes her dagger. "Sorry, dear, force of habit. One has to be quick in my line of work."

"Yes, I mean, I understand." Lati sets the glasses down, and with a shuddering breath, retracts her extra limbs.

Father coughs, sends me an apologetic look, and takes his seat. Mother starts bustling about the table as if nothing had happened. Sister sheathes her weapon the last. Her gaze lingers on Lati as she sits down, and the corners of her lips quirk up.

"Didn't know you were into the whole tentacle thing," she remarks, making Lati erupt in a scarlet brush.

"Shut up," I mutter, glaring at her.

Despite the narrowly averted catastrophe, the dinner was still going better than I expected.
