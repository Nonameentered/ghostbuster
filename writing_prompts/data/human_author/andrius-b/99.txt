Nedrunos turned his keen eyes to the sky, peering at something beyond the clouds, beyond even the air that shrouded the world. The ground quaked as he uncoiled from the fortress housing his hoard, and gales rose as he unfurled his wings. With a noise that reverberated through the land, he took flight.

Songs would be composed about this day.

His powerful wings took him past the highest clouds and beyond. They beat faster and faster as the air thinned and refused to support him. Folding them, Nedrunos cast the spells he had developed over centuries, spells of propulsion and preservation and others, his gaze fixated on his target.

The hoard he had painstakingly gathered over millennia granted him immense power, power unimaginable to mages of lesser kinds, but it wasn't enough, never enough. Meriander was encroaching upon his realm from the south, his strength fueled by the treasures of the ancient elven kingdom he had unearthed. Voipre was growing ever stronger in her islands; rumors said she found a method to extract gold from the sea itself, and she guarded it jealously.

Nedrunos needed an edge lest he be overcome and eaten like so many others. And if the supply of precious metals in the world had been all but exhausted—why, he just had to look beyond.

The planet curved below, the continents and oceans so tiny from his lofty height. Stars glowed brighter than he had ever seen, and among them loomed his target. Pitch-black on one side and coruscating in the sun on the other, the asteroid made his seven hearts race. His instincts told him that underneath layers of worthless iron there lay a treasure to dwarf all treasures—more gold than the greatest of his kind could even dream of.

He accelerated to intercept his prize, making minute adjustment to his course; a trivial task to a mind of his caliber. Finally he touched down on the surface and sank in his claws, feeling the ice and gravel that had been here for aeons crumble.

Spreading his wings, he cast a spell to extend them for hundreds, then thousands of miles like a glimmering veil. They caught the warming rays of the sun, and he felt them nudge him and his prize into a collision course with the planet below. 

Nedrunos laughed without a sound. His calculations had been correct.

Turning ponderously, he reached his continent-spanning wings toward the planet to brake against its shroud of air. Were his brethren and sisters watching from below? Were they screaming in fury, commanding their armies at his hoard? One way or another, they would be too late.

His tendons snapped and his bones creaked under the strain. Ice boiled off the asteroid, revealing the iron underneath that swiftly turned red. His blue scales, proof against enchanted blades and dragonfire, melted under the heat. The membranes of his wings tore, and his eyes boiled in their sockets. Still he greedily sought purchase on his fracturing prize with his claws as he constantly cast spells to adjust its trajectory. He could lose his sight, but his hoard down below was like a beacon.

The ground hurtled ever closer at a speed that would prove lethal even to him. Shedding every protective spell, Nedrunos poured the last of his magic into sapping the asteroid's momentum. The pain was such that an agonized roar escaped his throat in a streak of flame.

The impact shattered every bone of his body, and a cloud of debris blackened the sun. His claws shattered, and he slid off the glowing core of the asteroid to slump in a heap beside it. Every last shred of his magic had been expended; even the most pathetic knight could have run a sword through his throat.

The mountain of metal beside him crackled and popped. A molten rivulet trickled from its depths and pooled around his broken form. The beat of his three hearts strengthened, and a shuddering breath entered his lungs as power returned to his body.

He drew another breath, then another, and worked his magic. His bones reformed, then the muscle around them, and skin and scales more brilliant than before. Still power poured into him, more than any of his kind had ever possessed—the power of a god.

Nedrunos rose triumphantly, spread his grand wings, and cleared the skies with a roar that echoed around the world.
