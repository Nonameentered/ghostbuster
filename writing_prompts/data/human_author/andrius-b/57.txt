Prince Gideon strolled through the palace gardens, orienting himself by the prickly rose bushes and the little imperfections of the gravel path. Medusa clutched his hand, her steps much less confident than his because of the blindfold covering her eyes. 

"Are you certain I can be here, Gideon?" she asked quietly. "Though I hold no love for humans, I don't desire needless conflict."

Gideon laughed. "Am I a prince or not? You don't need to worry, my friend."

"Friend," she repeated as if tasting the word. "We are friends, then?"

He was so surprised he halted mid-stride. "I should like to think so, Medi. Haven't we spent days just talking back in your cave? Haven't we shared our life's worries?"

"Yes. Yes, we have." She laughed. "A friend! You are the first I've had since I was cursed."

He smiled and resumed walking. "If we're lucky, perhaps you will find another soon."

"I wouldn't dare hope. My appearance..."

"I don't understand why you keep saying that. The day you allowed me to see your face, I could tell you were a most beautiful woman."

She sighed wistfully. "It's my curse. Anyone looking at me with their eyes and not their fingers would only see a hideous monster."

He squeezed her hand. "Then it's their loss for being satisfied with a surface look."

Medusa leaned closer, and one of her snakes brushed his cheek. He smiled and pulled her onward.

"Smell the fragrance of roses." He inhaled deeply. "Feel the sun warm your face. It is worth stepping out of your cave for this, is it not?"

"You're right," she said. "It has been too long since I felt the wind on my face."

"I wish you could see the gardens' splendor, not just feel it. Perhaps at night..."

He trailed off at the sound of heavy footsteps drawing near. Medusa stiffened, and he stepped in front of her, hearing her snakes hiss and taste the air anxiously.

"Your Highness!" By the jangle of armor, it was a palace guard, though not one Gideon recognized by voice. "Is—is everything all right?"

"Quite," Gideon said, raising his eyebrows. "I am merely taking a walk with my guest."

The guard's feet shifted on the gravel. "Begging your pardon, I did not realize. Do you require an escort?"

He smiled faintly. "That won't be necessary."

The guard smacked his fist against his breastplate. "Understood, Your Highness. Have a pleasant evening."

The steps retreated, slower than they had approached. Medusa exhaled and loosened her grip on his hand. 

"See?" Gideon said. "No one will dare touch a hair on your head, as it were. I wouldn't be so confident about wandering out into the city, but..."

"I don't need the city," she said. "I'm happy as long as I'm with you."

Her words made Gideon's heart somersault in his chest, but he told himself it was just because she had been lonely for a very long time. "I'm happy when I'm with you too."

They walked on in companionable silence. The air cooled; they had drawn close enough to the palace for it to shade the sun. He found the smooth cool wall by touch and continued alongside it.

"Prince Gideon!" cried a familiar voice. "Please wait!"

Gideon turned and schooled his lips into a polite smile. "I trust the evening finds you well, Lady Demetria."

"Yes, my prince." She sounded flustered. "I was hoping you would keep me company this evening—"

A faint hiss drifted through the air.

"Ah, where are my manners," Gideon said. "This is Medusa, my dear friend."

Lady Demetria swallowed audibly. "Your friend... I see. Good evening, Lady Medusa." She took a bracing breath. "As I was saying, my prince, I have been practicing the harp and I would love for you to—"

Medusa's snakes rustled and unleashed a chorus of hisses.

"P-perhaps another time," Lady Demetria squeaked, and scurried away.

Gideon resisted the urge to laugh. Lady Demetria's attentions were often annoying, although he did not resent her for that. Her father has been pressuring her to marry him to strengthen the position of their family.

"Medi?" he said mildly. "Has Lady Demetria offended you in some way?"

She exhaled. "I'm sorry, Gideon. It's my snakes. I don't know what came over them—I can usually control them so well..."

"Truly?"

"No," she murmured, letting go of his hand. "I lied. The thought of you leaving me to keep her company irritated me so much that I couldn't stay still."

His heart did that funny flip again. "I see."

"Are you angry?" she asked forlornly.

"Not at all," he said, fumbling for her hand. "Still, there was no need to do that. If I left you alone after I invited you here, I would be a poor host indeed. This evening is for us."

"Oh," she said. "Oh, I see." She shuffled closer, so close he could feel her breath. "Gideon?"

"Yes?" he whispered.

Her snakes twined through his hair, and her warm lips brushed his. "Thank you."
