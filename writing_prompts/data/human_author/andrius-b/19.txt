Commander Thruun stared at the blue-and-green planet on the display through its multifaceted eyes. The infiltration wasn't going well. Earth had so many different governments that it had proved impossible to take them over before the locals noticed them. 

His aide glided in, a tentacled form with twelve eyes. Although outwardly the two couldn't have looked more different, they both were a part of the Collective, their hosts' home planets long since assimilated into the greater whole.

"Report," Thruun said.

"The humans developed a way to detect our hosts," the aide said. "Most countries have started systematically checking their populations."

Thruun clicked its mandibles. Such failures had happened before, but invariably they came at a great cost to the local population and thus fighting power. Perhaps the Collective could still salvage this. "They're eliminating the hosts, then?"

"Not eliminating, Commander. The humans seem to have found a way to disable our nervous systems and free the hosts from our control."

"Their medical sciences are more advanced than I thought," Thruun muttered. "We should have committed to a direct military invasion from the start."

The aide's tentacles undulated. "That is not all, commander. They've taken to... growing more of our larva in vats."

Thruun stared at his aide in disbelief. "To what end?"

"The humans have learned of our perfect mimicry and started implanting our flesh to replace their own failing organs or missing limbs."

"They're using our flesh for *medical treatment*?" Thruun shuddered as he glanced at the screen. He had directed the assimilation of many planets in the name of the Collective, but the sight of this Earth suddenly filled him with dread.
