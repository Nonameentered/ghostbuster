A group of Neophytes stand at attention in a dusty training hall. A grizzled Templar paces before them, searching for any flaw in their stances, any weakness in their eyes. He is long retired from active duty, but his back is ramrod straight and he wears his pockmarked armor with pride.

"Who is our Enemy?" he barks.

"The Supernatural," the Neophytes chorus. "The Otherwordly, the spawns of Heaven and Hell."

"And what do we give them?"

"Death!" 

"You may think these words a meaningless ceremony, but they will save your life one day," the Templar says with certainty forged in countless battles. "The Enemy possesses unnatural powers against which conviction is the only defense. They will appeal, threaten, and plead. They will appear in guises uglier than sin or more beautiful than anything you have seen in your life. Regardless, you must never show them mercy. The slightest doubt will become a chink in your armor that will spell your end."

The Neophytes listen attentively, but they don't *understand*, not yet. The Templar casts his gaze over the ranks, meeting their eyes. Some burn with zeal, others harbor uncertainty. It is his job to eradicate the latter.

"I ask you now, do you have doubts?" the Templar says. "Look deep into your hearts and speak truthfully. You will not be punished." 

The Neophytes exchange sideways glances and fidget. The silence stretches on, and it almost looks like no one will speak. Then a young man with sandy hair opens his mouth, only to close it again.

"Speak," the Templar says, almost kindly.

"I... I understand why we fight devils and the like," the man stammers. "But aren't angels a force of good?"

A murmur ripples through the ranks at his daring, but the Templar raises a fist, and everyone falls silent. The young man shrinks under his heavy gaze. An idealist. There is always one or two in every batch. 

"I ask you this in turn: Who gave these tyrant preachers the right to judge and sentence us? Such an authority can only be granted by the people, and we will never bow under the yoke of outsiders! Only a human will judge other humans."

The Templar makes a swift gesture. A pair of Squires wheel in a cage covered with a runic cloth that flutters as if whatever's inside is struggling to escape. Some Neophytes swallow and inch backward.

The Templar nods, and a Squire pulls down the cloth. Inside the cage, an angel unfurls its sixteen wings and beholds the gathered with its glowing eye. Its voice echoes in their skulls.

**You have sinned**. **Kneel**. **Repent**.

The sandy-haired man sways on his feet, and he isn't the only one. The eyes of those with less-than-pure pasts glimmer with remorseful tears.

"Don't," roars the Templar. "Don't you *dare* debase yourselves before that thing."

The Neophytes straighten up, their fear of the man momentarily exceeding the fear of the divine. The Templar approaches the young man and draws his runic sword. The Neophyte trembles.

"Please," he mutters, "I'm sorryâ€”"

"Who is our Enemy?" the Templar asks.

The walls of the hall tremble as the Neophytes' voices drown out the angel's. "The Supernatural, the Otherwordly, the spawns of Heaven and Hell!"

The Templar turns the sword around and offers the hilt to the Neophyte. "And what do we give them?" he asks quietly.

The Neophyte glances at the angel and firms his jaw. "Death," he says, and takes the sword.
