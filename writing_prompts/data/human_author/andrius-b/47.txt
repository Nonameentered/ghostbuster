Ian clasped his hands behind his back and admired the beam of the stellar laser stretching into the blackness of the intergalactic void. Laser highways already crisscrossed the Milky Way, permitting interstellar craft to be pushed along them without having to carry much fuel. Soon they would extend even further, linking the rogue stars in the void and ultimately connecting the galaxies in the Local Group.

The lights suddenly dimmed, and the clock at the bottom edge of the screen stopped. Despite the station's climate control, tendrils of ice crept along the floor. A memory rose from the vast recesses of Ian's mind; he had forgotten many things, but never this dreadful feeling.

The Entity spoke into his head in a voice that wasn't a voice. *You're quite a ways from where I left you last.*

Ian tried to turn around and found that he couldn't move. "It's been a while," he said in a puff of steam. "I've been busy."

*I expected you to be driven insane from watching everything you ever knew die.* A note of bewilderment entered the Entity's voice. *Instead I find you... thriving.*

He smiled mildly. "I should be thanking you. You gave me the luxury to think in terms of centuries and millennia, not years or decades. The time to experience the wonders of the universe, and help others do the same."

*You say that, yet you try to stave off the end by any means possible. You're afraid. The others aren't; they won't be there to witness it.* Icy tendrils wrapped Ian's body, making him shiver. *But even after the last star in the universe burns out, you will still be here, floating in the cold void.*

"I won't be alone. Black holes will remain for far longer than the stars will have existed. We will digitalize ourselves and harvest their energy. The coldness of the void will merely be a boon to our computers."

*Pathetic remnants of life clinging to corpses of stars*, the Entity jeered. *A sad existence in a dark universe.* 

"On the contrary, we will possess any luxury we could imagine. In the worlds we craft, we will be gods."

*Even your black holes will eventually evaporate. There will be nothing left for you. You* will *be alone.*

"Eons will pass before that happens. There will be countless quintillions of minds sharing ideas across the universe. We will figure something out."

*A useless exercise. Entropy cannot be reversed. Everything you build will decay.*

Ian closed his eyes, then opened them again. "Perhaps, then, I will despair. But not before."

*You're the most frustrating creature I've ever met*, the Entity said with something that was almost respect. *I shall visit you again and see your spirit crushed.*

"I look forward to disappointing you again," Ian said, directing his gaze back to the stellar laser on the screen. There were plans to be made, things to be built. Nothing the Entity said would change that.
