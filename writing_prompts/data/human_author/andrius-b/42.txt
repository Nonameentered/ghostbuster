Bonifatius yawned as he descended the spiral stairs of his tower. Nora was waiting downstairs with a steaming cup of tea in her metal hands, as she did every morning since he dug her up from the ancient ruins. Bonifatius accepted it gratefully and took a sip.

"Ah, delicious," he murmured. "I wonder how you manage to brew it so perfectly every time."

"It is merely a matter of following the procedure, master," Nora said evenly. "I prepared breakfast. After you have eaten, shall we resume our experiments?"

Bonifatius smiled fondly. She had proved to be an invaluable assistant, drawing magical circles with unerring precision and even improving them using some ancient art called calculus. "Alas, we have to put those on hold. I received a messenger bird; the king's general wants six dozen healing potions for his armies, and that's enough work for a fortnight."

"That will deplete most of our ingredients," Nora noted. "Will the compensation for this work suffice to replenish them?"

Bonifatius shook his head ruefully. "The king's treasury is already stretched thin because of the southern rebellion. We'll be lucky to receive a thank-you note." 

"Yet you intend to proceed with this work nevertheless?"

"Orders are orders. Every wizard in the kingdom has to swear fealty to the throne."

Nora was silent for a moment. "Master, do people like being ruled by the king?"

He burst into chuckles. For all her cold intellect, she was so naive sometimes. "Most curse him in their sleep, I imagine. The taxes have never been so high, and he rules with an iron fist." He sighed. "Even if he perishes, his brother is likely to become regent, and people say he's even worse. There's nothing we can do but hope for better times."

Nora inclined her metal head. "Master, may I have a few days off?"

Bonifatius stared at her in surprise. She had never asked him for anything personal before. "Well—well, I suppose you can. You've worked very hard."

"Thank you," Nora said, turning toward the door. "Breakfast is ready in the kitchen."

"But where are you..."

He trailed off as Nora resolutely walked out of the door. He watched her stride along the trail through the forest that connected to the nearby town, then sighed and went to have breakfast. Work awaited.

Completing the general's order took the entire week, and he even had to sacrifice hours of sleep. He missed Nora's tireless assistance, but as far as he was concerned, machine or not, she deserved the time off. And so he persevered alone.

Finally the potions were brewed, filtered, and bottled. Bonifatius stacked them into crates lined with straw, picked up his staff, and opened a portal into the kingdom's capital to deliver them.

The moment he set foot in the city, he could tell something was wrong. Some of the buildings were damaged by a fire, and the smell of recent violence hung in the air. Yet the people walking the streets were singing songs and laughing—a rare sight since the king had taken the throne.

Bonifatius flagged down a group of men passing by. "Excuse me! What is the cause for your merriment?"

One of the men snorted. "Have you been living under a rock? The king's gone!"

"And may he rot in hell!" seconded his companion.

"Hear, hear!"

 "Who took the throne, then?" Dread gripped Bonifatius's heart. "Was it his brother who overthrew him?"

"Gods, no. There *is* no king!" The declaration was followed by a cheers from the entire group.

Bonifatius shook his head, his mind sluggish from lack of sleep. "Then who is ruling the country?"

"The people," the man said proudly. "It's a republic now!"

"A *what*?"

"A representative form of government ruled by elected representatives," Nora said, coming up from behind. New dents and scratches marred her metal body. "Sorry I'm late, master. I just finished helping the new government draft their constitution."

"Liberator," the men murmured, bowing to Nora.

Bonifatius gaped at her. "What... How... Did you do this?"

"The kingdom's interference proved an obstacle to our work," Nora said, "and I judged that the best solution was to change the political system."

"I see," Bonifatius murmured, stunned.

"The people will take it from here, so we can resume our experiments now." There was a note of eagerness in her metallic voice. "Please teleport us to the laboratory, master."

"Yes... yes, let's go." Bonifatius swallowed uneasily and raised his staff. *What have I unleashed*?
