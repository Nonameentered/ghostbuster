Dimitrios couldn't believe his eyes. The hydra's necks all emerged from where the strange woman was kicking her legs and screaming for help. Her voice was muffled by the snake-flesh that had swallowed her upper body.

A hydra's head slammed into him during his distraction, denting his breastplate. Regaining his footing, he sprang forth and cleaved the neck close to the base. The cut-off serpent withered away, not regrowing for the first time, while the stump convulsed.

"Are you all right?" he cried.

"Yes, yes," she said impatiently. "Keep going! Cut close to the roots!"

He adjusted the grip on his xiphos, glared up at the swaying serpent heads, and leaped into the fray. Now that he knew the monster's weakness, it was no match for his skill. As he slashed and hewed furiously, more and more serpents fell away until all twenty were slain.

The woman sat up with a groan, her eyes squeezed shut. "Thank you so much, stranger. You saved me a great deal of trouble and embarrassment."

Dimitrios considered her warily. Atop her head now writhed dozens of tiny snakes whose heads looked just like the hydra's in miniature. "You're welcome, lady..."

She laughed. "It's been so long since anyone called me a lady! My name is Medusa."

"Pray tell, Medusa, what's going on? I came to slay a hydra terrorizing the nearby village. I never expected to find a woman with... hair problems."

She flushed. "It must've been a curse by Athena's followers. The moment I settle down, they decide to pester me again." Without opening her eyes, she felt about her head. "Say, could you take just a little more off the sides?"

He eyed the snakes dubiously. "Doesn't it... hurt?"

"Only a little, and they grow right back. Please? I don't want to face my enemies all messy and give them the satisfaction."

He shrugged, raised his xiphos, and slashed the snakes. Immediately they grew new heads that proceeded to taste the air with forked tongues and hiss at him.

Medusa smiled. "Lovely. Now the other side, please?"

He swung again.

"Even out my bangs?"

His blade arced in a precise horizontal slash.

Medusa cracked open one eye. "Mind if I borrow your shield?" Stooping, she eyed her reflection critically. "Hmm. Trim a little more here, if you would..."

Dimitrios hacked and slashed at the wriggling snakes until she was finally satisfied.

"Oh my, I never looked better." She preened before the shield. "You must have a lot of experience to cut hair this well."

"Trained my entire life," he said in a slightly pained voice. "In *swordsmanship*."

"Your talents are wasted on fighting if you ask me. Say, could you do my hair again sometime? My sisters will be *so* jealous."

Before he could refuse, she sashayed to a cabinet by the edge of the cave and returned with a palmful of golden coins that she pressed into his hands. He gaped.

"Just a little something for the best haircut in my life," she said happily. "Do come by again. I'll even recommend you to my sisters!"

Dimitrios nodded and walked out of the cave machinely. The coins gleamed in the sunlight. Never had he seen so much gold in one place before. Saving remote villages from monsters just didn't pay very well. He glanced over his shoulder at the cave. Perhaps a change in profession was in order.
