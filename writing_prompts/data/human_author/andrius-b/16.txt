The barman drops a bulging 9-volt battery into a shaker and goes at it, then strains it into a pint glass. A greyish sizzling liquid comes out. Pat swears in awe and leans closer. The barman takes a tennis ball, peels off a slice, and sets it into the glass. He nudges the drink toward Pat.

Pat grasps the glass, only to let go with a gasp; it's hot. The drink smells acidic, and the slice of the tennis ball is smoking slightly. 

"Is this like a magic trick?" he asks. "'Cause that was damned cool."

The barman shakes his head. There's something weird about his face; it's so average that if asked to describe him Pat wouldn't be able to. A guy. Darkish hair. Middle-aged. Just a regular guy, you know?

Pat carefully picks up the glass and swirls the drink around, mesmerized. He snorts and sets it down. "I'm not going to drink that, you know?"

The barman shrugs and takes the glass away. He crosses his arms and stands under that stupid sign that says "Will make a drink out of anything", the same way Pat found him when he came in.

"Old Fashioned," Pat says after some hesitation. "No funny business this time."

The barman muddles the sugar, adds a dash of bitters, then rye and a large piece of ice. He finishes it off with peels of orange. Pat takes a gingerly sip. Tastes fantastic. 

He leans back on his stool and eyes the stoic barman. "So, anything, huh?"

The barman glances up at the sign as if to tell him it's a stupid question.

"Are you mute or something?" Pat asks. "Sorry, no offense. Is that offensive these days? I have no idea."

The barman says nothing.

Pat takes another sip. "Talking to myself like an idiot," he mutters. "How about you make me a drink from a brick, a dash of gasoline, and, uh, a fucking olive."

The barman starts before he had even finished the sentence. He splashes in gasoline from a canister he somehow had behind the bar. Cracks off a piece of brick with an ice pick. Puts a friggin olive on top. Sets the drink before him, reddish and stinking like hell.

Pat claps sarcastically. He drinks normal drinks and amuses himself by making increasingly ridiculous requests. Nothing fazes the barman. It doesn't even seem to be limited to physical things. Mare milk and the first cry of a newborn produce a violently bubbling drink that screeches at him, and he shakes his head and pushes it away, deeply disturbed.

A thought occurs to him, and he squints at the barman as he considers it, nursing his whiskey. Perhaps because of the drinks he'd had, the barman's face—his entire figure—seems blurred around the edges, like he's not entirely there.

"Memories," Pat hears himself say as if from far away. "Memories of my wife... that's it."

The barman stares at him.

"What?" Pat snaps. "Can't do it?"

The barman glances at the sign as if in a reminder, then raises a hand and slowly passes it in front of Pat's face. Grabs something. Pretends to toss it into a chilled highball glass. Nods and nudges it toward Pat.

Pat frowns and picks it up. Faint vapor rises from the cold glass. A strangely familiar smell drifts to his nose. He can't place it, but it's deeply comforting and makes him ache deep inside. Then the moment passes.

"The glass is empty," Pat accuses, looking up. 

The barman crosses his arms.

Pat opens his mouth angrily, then swallows, blinks furiously, and lifts his hand to his cheek. Tears are trailing down his face, dripping down onto the bar. "What is this? What did you do to me?"

The barman is unmoved.

"Whatever, man. I don't know what your game is, but I've had enough of this shit." He pulls out his wallet, muttering angrily, then pauses. There's a faded photo of a strange woman inside. For the life of him, he can't recall putting it there. He stares for a long moment, then shakes off his stupor, slaps several banknotes on the bar, and staggers away.

"Fucking joker and his magic tricks," he mutters, glancing back at the bar. It feels like had forgotten something very important, but he can't even remember what it was. He shakes his head and starts home.
