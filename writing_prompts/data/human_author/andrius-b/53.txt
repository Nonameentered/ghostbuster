Steve grabbed the ketchup bottle from the fridge and grimaced as it oozed over his hand. He turned over the bottle. There they were, two puncture marks from his wife's little fangs. This couldn't go on. He would have to confront her.

He washed his hand and stepped out into the hallway. "Val?"

There was no answer, but the TV was blaring from the living room. He crossed the hallway and paused at the door. Valerie sat cross-legged on the couch, eating one pickle after another directly from the jar. No, not *eating*—she would sink her fangs into them, suck out the juice, and discard the sad remains into a bowl.

"Valerie?"

Her head jerked toward him, and she tried to hide the jar behind her back, but her latest pickle-victim was still stuck in her mouth. "Mmph!" Sucking it dry, she spat out the remains and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand. "W-what is it?"

"I thought you didn't like human food," he said, coming closer.

"I... don't. I was just in the mood for something salty, that's all."

Sighing, he sat down beside her. "The same way you were in the mood for ketchup? That was the seventh bottle you murdered this week."

It was rare for his wife to blush, but when she did, the pink was very prominent on her pale cheeks. "So I get an itch to sink my fangs into something now and then. What's the harm?"

"I'm not complaining, Val. Just worried."

"I keep telling you, I'm fine," she said, rolling her crimson eyes.

Steve took a deep breath. "Have you ever thought that you might be... well, pregnant?"

Her mouth sagged open before she erupted into laughter. "Pregnant. *Me*? Stevie, let me explain it in simple terms." She pointed at him. "Human." Then at herself. "Vampire."

"Yes, yes, I know your kind supposedly can't have children. It's just"—he gestured at the jar—"how do you explain all this?"

She shrugged self-consciously. "They're just cravings. Blood gets old after a while."

He reached into his pocket and produced his purchase from the pharmacy. "There's an easy way to find out."

"Are you serious?" She goggled at the pregnancy test, then at him. "Love, don't kid yourself. It won't ever happen—"

"Humor me. Please?"

She considered his serious expression and sighed. "Fine. I'll do it, and it will come out negative, and then I'll make fun of you, like, *forever*." Snatching the test, she rose to her feet and walked out of the room. "Of all the ridiculous ideas..."

Steven exhaled and slouched back on the couch. Valerie's footsteps retreated down the hallway, and the bathroom door creaked. Before he knew it, his knee started bouncing, and he had to wipe his sweaty palms on his pants. He had come to terms with not having children when he married her and never regretted the decision. Still, the thought that it may happen after all made his heart pound.

The bathroom door creaked again and Val slowly walked into the living room, her eyes wide. He sprang to his feet.

"Steve," she said weakly, holding up the test, "two lines means not preggo, right?"

He opened and closed his mouth several times. "Pretty sure it's the opposite. Said so right there on the package." A grin slowly spread over his lips.

"But..." She shook her head. "But that's *impossible*."

He walked up to her and enveloped her in a hug. "Apparently not as impossible as we thought." 

She tilted her head up and narrowed her eyes. "Do you have some sort of super sperm?"

He snorted. "Not as far as I know."

 "We... we really are going to have a baby?"

"We will," he said, stroking her silky black hair.

"It's going to grow inside me."

"Well, that's how it usually works."

"And then be born."

"Give it nine months. A little less now, I suppose."

"A baby. I'm going to have a baby." Valerie sniffled, and then it was as if the floodgates had been opened, and she hugged him without holding back her strength and bawled into his chest. "I never thought... Oh, Steven."

Even though her hug threatened to crack his ribs, he only smiled and kissed the crown of her head. "I'll go buy some more ketchup tomorrow."
