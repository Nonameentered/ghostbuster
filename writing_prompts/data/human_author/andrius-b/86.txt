Cyprian ambled down the bustling street, not bothering to avoid the people. Those he bumped into would whirl around, stare in confusion, then mutter an oath and move on. Occasionally a more belligerent man would accuse another of shoving him, and a scuffle would break out. 

Years ago, Cyprian would have laughed gleefully at the chaos. These days such trivialities did not even elicit a dry chuckle. 

He spied a fruit merchant and slunk closer. An old woman was meticulously inspecting the apples for bruises before putting them into her bag. Out of habit, Cyprian lingered behind her, watching the merchant's beady eyes. The moment the man extended his hand to accept the payment, Cyprian swiped a fat juicy apple off the top of the pile. 

No one noticed. He wanted to believe the outcome would have been the same had he not drank from that damned spring.

Snorting mirthlessly, he slouched back against the wall and bit into the apple. The invisibility had seemed like a blessing at first. He robbed palaces and temples and made every noble this side of the continent clutch their purses to their chests at night. Cyprian the Phantom, the posters called him, and offered a bounty of his weight in gold.

But the elation at each successful heist wore thinner and thinner. It wasn't his clever mind or his deft fingers, it wasn't his knowledge of locking mechanisms and human psychology, it wasn't the painstakingly mastered tricks of his trade that made him succeed. Any halfwit in his shoes could have done the same.

Scowling, he tossed the apple core into the crowd. A man in fine silks swore and looked around for the offender. Dozens of gazes were directed at Cyprian and slid right off him—except one. 

Cyprian froze. The gaze belonged to a pale young woman with dark bags under her eyes and stiff shoulders. Her strikingly green eyes lingered on him, then flicked at the other passersby, and her brow knitted in perplexion.

Before he knew what he was doing, Cyprian pushed off the wall and started toward her. Some horrible understanding crossed her face, and pulling up her skirts, she took off down the street. He gave chase, ramming through the crowd and leaving angry shouts in his wake.

The woman glanced over her shoulder and ran faster. Cyprian swore as he weaved around a couple strolling in the opposite direction. Back in his heyday, he would have caught up easily, but this effortless life had dulled his edge.

"Wait!" he cried.

She glanced back again, piercing him with those green eyes, and ducked into a back alley. Cyprian's heart raced with equal parts excitement and exertion as he followed. How long had it been since someone looked at him?

A cry escaped the woman's lips as she tripped and collapsed onto the grimy cobblestones. As Cyprian ran up, panting, she faced him and drew a small gleaming dagger. 

"Stay away," she hissed.

He halted, stunned by the terror in her eyes. "Please, I just want to talk," he said, his voice hoarse with misuse. "Good lord, do you know how long it's been since I spoke to anyone?"

Doubt crossed her eyes, and the dagger in her hands shook. "You can't trick me, *fiend*."

"Calm down, I beg you," he said, stepping closer. "You'll hurt yourself like that."

The woman slashed at him clumsily, her chest heaving with panicked breaths. He lurched out of the path of the blade, then seized her wrist and disarmed her. She snarled and yanked her hand free before an expression of astonishment came over her face.

"You're not cold," she murmured.

"Why would I be?" He tucked the dagger behind his belt and offered her his hand. "I swear I mean you no harm. Won't you let me look at your leg? I'm no physician, but I picked up a few things here and there."

She peered up at him like a frightened deer, searching his face, his eyes. Slowly she reached for his hand, brushed his fingers, then gripped them. Hers was a good strong hand, not like the clammy powdered hands of nobles who never saw any hardship. 

Smiling faintly, he pulled her up and helped her toward an old crate. She sat down and allowed him to divest her of her shoe, her eyes never leaving his face. Cyprian relished the pleasure of someone's scrutiny as he prodded her swollen ankle and used her dagger to cut his handkerchief into strips.

"I thought you were one of them," she said.

Cyprian looked up. "Pardon?"

She clenched her fists until her knuckles were white. "My eyes... they're special. I see things no one else can—and some of those things see me too."

He set to gently binding her ankle. "That must be terrible."

"You believe me?" she asked quickly.

"How could I not? You're the first person to see me in nearly a decade."

"But how can that be?" She timidly touched his shoulder as if to reassure herself. "You have flesh, you're warm. Are you not a man?"

He laughed bitterly. "A foolish man. In my greed, I wished for a great boon but received a curse instead."

Her face softened in sympathy. "Oh," she said sadly. "Then we're the same."
