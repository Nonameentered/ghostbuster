Ryan smiled as he swayed to the music with Aiko. It had taken some effort to convince her to come to the prom, but it had all been worth it. She fit so perfectly in his arms, her head resting in the crook of his neck and her waist-length black hair spilling down her back.

The music stopped, and Aiko slowly lifted her head. Her dark eyes sparkled, and what little of her cheeks he could see above her face mask were flushed from the dancing. One day, he hoped he would be able to tell her how beautiful she was.

"Fancy a drink?" he asked.

"I'd love one." She glanced at the crowded drinks table and almost shyly added, "I hope there's a straw."

He chuckled and clasped her hand. "I'm sure we can find one."

They weaved through the crowd, only to halt abruptly when Todd swaggered into their path. His girlfriend was clinging to his arm, and the two were surrounded by their usual hangers-on.

"'Sup, Ryan," Todd said, looking Aiko up and down. "Can't believe you managed to get a date."

"I did," he said, "and we were just about to grab a drink, so..." He tried to step around him.

Todd barred his way. "C'mon, aren't you even going to introduce her?" He winked at Aiko. "What's your name, cutie?"

"Aiko," she said softly, sizing him up.

Todd grinned at the attention. Ryan shook his head; if only the idiot knew that that was the look she gave her potential victims. 

Todd's girlfriend glanced at her boyfriend sourly and sneered at Aiko. "What's with the mask, weirdo?"

Ryan stepped in before her. "She's feeling a little under the weather."

Todd's girlfriend snorted and turned to her groupies. "It's adorable how he's acting, like, all protective of her."

Ryan rolled his eyes at the ensuing giggles. It wasn't *Aiko* he was trying to protect.

"Yeah, man," Todd said. "She can speak for herself, can't she?"

"Sure," Aiko said sweetly, stepping out from behind Ryan. "You want me to take this off, right?" She toyed with the strap of her mask.

Todd leered. "Hell yeah."

Aiko's eyes curved into crescent moons, and before Ryan could stop her, she slipped the mask off. Todd blanched, his grin fading; his girlfriend screamed; and her groupies recoiled so quickly one fell backwards on her ass.

"Am I beautiful?" Aiko asked, gracing Todd with her toothy, ear-to-ear smile.

Todd shrieked girlishly and scampered away on all fours, his hangers-on following suit. A pair of gleaming scissors appeared in Aiko's pale hand, and she started after him, but Ryan caught her by the elbow.

"Not here," he said sternly. "We've talked about this."

"Sorry, love." She fidgeted with the scissors, her gaze alternating between Ryan and her retreating victims. "I just get these urges..."

"I know, I know." He fished a hard candy out of his pocket. "Here, have some candy."

"Thanks." She pecked him on the cheek and tossed the candy into her inhumanly large mouth.

Ryan spied the chaperone approaching and motioned to Aiko to put her mask on. She did so just before the out-of-breath teacher hurried up to them.

"What's going on here? Some girls are in hysterics." The teacher cast Aiko an uncertain look. "They're saying they saw... something."

Aiko crunched on the candy loudly as she stared back at him.

"I'm pretty sure they've been drinking," Ryan said, quickly putting an arm around her shoulders. "We were just leaving, anyway." Not waiting for a reply, he steered her away.

Aiko glanced at him. "Sorry," she murmured. "I know how much you wanted to come."

"Don't be silly. I only wanted to come here with *you*."

"Oh." She leaned against his shoulder. "Ryan," she said, casting him an impish look, "am I beautiful?"

He smiled at their little game. "Just average," he lied.
