A bus full of schoolchildren winded its way down a mountain road. They played music, argued, ate snacks, shoved and jostled one another, and otherwise got on the driver's nerves the way only eighty rowdy teens could. At least he didn't risk falling asleep driving through the night.

Suddenly the sky in front of the bus split, and an indescribable horror of oozing black tentacles and too many eyes descended onto the road. The driver swore and hit the brakes. It was the last thing he did before his mind broke from beholding the horror and he went limp, staring ahead with blank eyes.

Had his mind stayed intact a few seconds longer, he would've witnessed a peculiar sight. The bus behind him had gone abruptly silentâ€”and not out of fear. Mike, who always had his nose down a phone, was quickly looking up Sumerian incantations. The choir girls began chanting them even as his eyes scanned the screen. Jake watched the eldritch horror, his gaze carefully gliding along its edges, never the center. Those who had them were lighting their lighters, whose warm flames seemed to stall the tentacles.

The horror gave an ululating cry and surged toward the bus. Spiky tentacles stabbed through the roof and began ripping it off with a screech of metal. 

"Not Sumerian," Mike murmured, tapping the screen furiously. "Try Assyrian."

The girls abruptly switched to a different chant, and the horror recoiled with a screech of a hundred wounded beasts. The other teenagers added their voices to the whole, and as ancient words of power rang through the night, the horror seemed to coil and shrink upon itself. 

Jake took a lighter from another boy, and holding it aloft, walked to the front of the bus. The beast flung its tentacles at him, but they dissolved before they could penetrate the tiny circle of light created by the natural flames.

"**What are you**?" it snarled furiously.

Jake cracked a smile. "I'm the entire grade," he said in eighty voices.
