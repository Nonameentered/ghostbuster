The first time Ivar sang the song, the town guards fined him for public disturbance before he could finish the second verse. For his second attempt, he went to the rolling grassland outside the town. He hoped the dragon hadn't lied. He had put together a tidy sum and was ready to retire from adventuring; the only thing missing was someone to enjoy the good life with.

Standing at the crest of a hill, he took a deep breath and bellowed out the strident notes. A song in name only, it was an ancient form of magic that dragons used in lieu of spells. The verses thundered with more force than his lungs seemed capable of, stirring the grass and racing off to the faraway forest.

When the last fragment fell from his lips, he doubled over in a coughing fit. Straightening up, he cast his gaze about. Nothing but grass and the road winding from the town's gates into the distance.

Ivar chuckled at himself and started making his way back. It would be foolish to expect it to work like some siren's song. He just had to trust it had done its job.

As he descended unhurriedly from the hill, a shadow passed overhead. He glanced up, thinking it a cloud, only to freeze. An enormous red dragon flew high in the sky, blocking out the sun. It circled overhead once, twice. Then it folded its wings and swooped down, unmistakably, toward him.

He whimpered and ran for the town gates, but the dragon was faster. Diving down before him, it braked by spreading its wings, and the ensuing gust sent Ivar staggering backward. 

The dragon beheld him with its golden slit-pupil eyes. "Was it you?" it thundered. "Was it you who sang?"

He swallowed, shrinking under its gaze. "I-it was."

The dragon lowered its snout level with his head and sniffed. "You're no dragon," it said with surprise.

"Sorry," he squeaked, backtracking. "I think there's been a mistakeâ€”"

The dragon tilted its head and considered him, exhaling a puff of smoke. "Hmm. Human though you may be, your song is very pleasing."

Heedless of his protests, it reared on its powerful hind legs and pounced at him. Ivar screamed and fell on his back, shielding his face with his arms. But instead of the sharp claws he expected, something soft fell atop him, driving the air from his lungs.

He lowered his arms and stared. Hugging him was a a very well-endowed and very naked woman with striking golden eyes, a pair of curved horns, and a mane of brilliant red hair.

"I accept," she said, wagging her red-scaled tail.

"P-pardon?" he stammered.

She pushed up to her knees and folded her hands in her lap. "Oh, where are my manners. My name is Flordelis, She Who Reigns Over the Western Plains." She looked at him expectantly.

He swallowed. "I-Ivar."

"Ivar," she repeated as if tasting the word, and flashed her fangs at him. "I'm pleased to meet you. Is your cave nearby?"

"I, uh..." He shook his head, slung off his cloak, and draped it over her bare shoulders. "I don't understand. Why are you here?"

Flordelis blinked. "You sang the Song of Seeking a Mate, did you not?"

"I-I suppose I did." He mentally cursed the dragon who had taught him.

"And I wrestled you down, thus proving my strength."

He nodded slowly. No arguing that.

"So now we'll find a nice cave, and mate, and I'll lay a beautiful clutch of eggs." She smiled triumphantly at him. 

Ivar worked his jaw. "Humans don't live in caves," he said at last. He wasn't even going to touch that other one.

A frown knitted her brow. "Then how do you keep your young safe before they're ready to hunt on their own?"

"We build walls and roofs. Houses." Ivar opened his mouth. A hundred things whirled through his mind, but what he said in the end was, "I'll show you mine."

"Very well, lead on," she said somberly. "I must make sure it's safe from bears and tigers before we make our nest."

Ivar clasped her cloak to better cover her before leading her back to town, mentally patting himself on the back for his foresight in buying a stone house. It wasn't exactly what he had expected, but Flordelis made a striking woman, and he wasn't going to risk upsetting a dragoness who could flatten him like a pancake.
