Ramir, Swordmaster and Hero of the Realm, scowled as his pupil deftly navigated an obstacle course through the forest. Logs suspended from ropes swung at him from every direction, but he dodged them. A net fell on him from the canopy, but he sliced it apart. The ground crumbled under his feet, revealing a spike pit, but he jumped over it.

Ramir gritted his teeth. Even during his heyday, before age stiffened his joints and weakened his muscles, he couldn't have moved with such dexterity. The brat was a natural warrior, possessing beastlike instinct and reflexes. Once he went out into the world, he would achieve great feats, and his reputation would quickly eclipse Ramir's. In time, Ramir would only be known as a teacher of Samuel the Hero, not a renowned warrior in his own right.

He couldn't abide that.

An unfortunate accident during training seemed like the obvious solution. Trouble was, Sam handled everything with infuriating ease. When he sent the brat to the Glowing Swamps to find a wyvern egg, he returned muddy and stinking but without a single scratch. He climbed the supposedly insurmountable Lone Rock in half a day. And when Ramir sent him on an errand to the city's slums, a place ruled by a gang of bandits, the brat not only came back unscathed but had the gall to *thank* him for the "object lesson".

Ramir learned only later that the brat had single-handedly beaten up the notorious gang and handed them in to the city watchâ€”and, if the rumors were to be believed, he had done that without drawing his sword. Ramir had been so shaken he had to put the training on hold for two days. 

Out in the obstacle course, Sam triggered another trap and ducked under a swinging log that bristled with spikes. Ramir spat; the brat left him no choice. He lifted his heavy crossbow, cocked a bolt, and took careful aim. He waited until the brat was busy dodging another log and pulled the trigger.

Sam lurched back to avoid a heavy log, and it passed an inch before his face, ruffling his hair. A sharp *twang* resounded, and he drew his sword even as he twisted to avoid the shot. The blade flashed in an arc, cleaving the oncoming bolt in two, and Sam laughed in exhilaration as he straightened up.

Truth be told, he had been finding the training too easy for a while now. It was so nice of his master to keep thinking up new challenges like this.

He sheathed his sword and ran up the hill atop which Master Ramir stood. "How did I do, master?"

Master Ramir glanced down at his crossbow. "You still have a ways to go," he said stiffly.

Sam nodded, burning with determination. "I'll work harder, master."

Master Ramir pursed his lips and looked away. Sam sighed. Clearly his skills still weren't up to his master's standards. Sam vowed to train even harder and do him proud.
