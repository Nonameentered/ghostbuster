King Caius turned his cloak against the breeze blowing through the castle's courtyard and raised his gaze to the skies. The dragon's golden scales glinted in the sun, the hero's figure just visible atop its serpentine back. 

No one had been more surprised than Caius himself when he sent the hero to vanquish the dragon only to witness him return astride the beast. Still, it worked out in the end. The dragon needed four cows every day to satiate its hunger, but that was a small price to pay to end its terror over the provinces.

The dragon roared, shaking the castle walls, and spiraled down to the courtyard. King Caius's trusted advisor stepped back, and even his honor guard shifted uneasily, but Caius stood his ground. The king couldn't appear weak.

The ground trembled with the dragon's landing, and its claws struck sparks from the flagstones. The hero dismounted lightly, patted its scaly flank, and turned to the entourage.

"Morning, king," he said, waving. "What's up?"

Caius took a moment to collect himself. The hero's casual manner didn't offend him—he came from a strange world with strange customs—but it still took him aback now and then. "O' hero," he said, spreading his hands, "the kingdom requires your services once more. The Dread Tyrant's armies are encroaching upon our lands."

The hero grimaced. "Look, I thought we had an agreement. War isn't my thing."

"But our people are suffering," Caius said fervently. "The Tyrant already conquered several border villages and pressed the populace into her service. If this goes on, there won't be stopping her."

The hero shrugged. "Have you tried negotiating?"

"There's no reasoning with her," Caius said, shaking his head.

His advisor stepped forward. "Sire, if I may?" Receiving a nod, he faced the hero. "I understand, sir hero, that you have an affinity for beasts."

The hero grinned. "You mean like Buttercup here? Sure, they're awesome."

Caius eyed the dragon incredulously. *Buttercup*?

"Well, what you may not know is that the Dark Tyrant isn't human," the advisor continued with a gleam in his eye. "She has great horns like a goat, slit eyes like yon dragon, and wings black like the night."

The hero perked up. "Does she now? Think she can be ridden?"

The advisor's lips moved soundlessly for a time. "Well... in a manner of speaking..."

King Caius thought of the well-being of his kingdom and nodded firmly. "I'm certain that a great man like you would be able to mount her," he said, his beard twitching.

"Well, why didn't you say so from the start?" the hero exclaimed. "Where do I find this Dark Tyrant?"

"Her realm lies hundreds of leagues to the north," Caius said grimly. "She rules from a black castle with spires that pierce the clouds."

"Cool," the hero said. "Here, Buttercup, let's go for another flight."

He hopped onto the dragon, and the beast beat its wings so powerfully that Caius and his entourage had to shield their faces. Within moments, the dragon was just a speck of gold against the blue sky, moving north faster than any horse.

"I have a bad premonition about this," Caius murmured. "What have we done, old friend?"

"It's all for the good of the kingdom, sire," the advisor said, patting his shoulder.
