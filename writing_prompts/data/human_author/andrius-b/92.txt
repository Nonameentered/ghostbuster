Salazar spat sulfurous oaths as he trudged through the forest. What a damp, cold place. How did humans, pathetic wretches that they were, manage to survive here?

The trees thinned out at last, and wooden huts loomed ahead. Salazar quickened his steps. This was a chance to torment some humans and prove to the bastards who had exiled him that he had what it took to be a demon.

A few dozen villagers gathered in a muddy square between the huts, and a bear-like man holding a wooden mace was talking loudly. Salazar draped his shadow over himself like a cloak and sneaked closer. Kill the leader, and the rest of these wretches ought to fall in line.

He sneaked up to the man and snapped his neck, cutting off his tirade. The villagers gasped as he emerged from the shadows.

"Kneel before me," he ordered, "or the same fate awaits you."

Most villagers just gaped, while four or five roared and attacked him. Rolling his eyes, Salazar side-stepped an ungainly lunge and broke the attacker's knee with a well-aimed kick.

A man on the sidelines drew a rusty dagger, caught up with an attacker, and sank the blade between his ribs. Salazar nodded approvingly as he bashed another over the head; it must've been the man's fear that made him do such a thing.

In short order, the attackers were subdued or dead, and the rest fell to their knees into the mud. Salazar's lips curved up. Now he couldâ€”

"Praise be," a grizzled man cried, looking up at him. "Thank you for saving us from the bandits, my lord. Pray tell, what is your name?"

"Salazar," he muttered, eyeing the fallen in alarm. Their ragged clothes and grimy faces looked no different from the others'. Had he... done a good deed? The very thought made him shudder.

"Lord Salazar," the man said, rising to his feet. "I'm the elder of this humble village. Please stay with us tonight; we'll throw you a feast."

Salazar was about to scoff but held his tongue. This was a fine development. He could ingratiate himself with these people and make them trust him, which would make his eventual betrayal all the more horrible.

Besides, his legs ached and his shoes were damp.

"Don't overexert yourselves on my regard," Salazar said, eyeing the shabby huts with contempt.

"Worry not, my lord," the elder assured. "Our harvests were good, and the king's taxmen have been waylaid by bandits so often they hardly come about anymore. Come, please."

Even his contempt seemed to have been misinterpreted as concern. Perhaps he was a no-good demon after all. Pushing away the thought, Salazar followed the elder.

During the feast he ate and drank ravenously, yet never mind being upset, the villagers only cheered him on and praised his good appetite. He guzzled so much of the admittedly delicious mead that he swayed when the elder led him to a room upstairs.

Well past midnight, someone knocked on his door. Salazar jumped to his feet before realizing no inquisitor would be so polite. The elder's daughter crept inside dressed in a nightgown, her face glowing crimson in the moonlight.

"What do you want?" he demanded.

"M-Master Salazar," she stammered, clutching the front of her nightgown. "I've come to keep you company."

He looked her over speculatively. She was comely as far as humans went, lacking in horns and hoofs as they were. "Did the elder send you against your will?" he asked hopefully. "Do you hope to ensnare me with your feminine wiles so I would do your bidding?"

"That is not so!" she cried, meeting his eyes. "I simply wish to be with you, my lord. I've never seen a man so strong and handsome."

Salazar's lip curled in disgust. Pure, innocent love. "It wouldn't be proper," he declared, and taking the wench by the shoulders, he ushered her out of the room.

The next morning found Salazar at the elder's table, scratching his flank irritably. The linens had likely been lousy. "I need a bath."

"Of course, my lord." The elder turned to his daughter, who had been stealing blushing glances at Salazar. "Scrub out the big barrel; I'll heat some water."

Salazar sighed. "Have you any soap?" he asked without much hope.

"Afraid not, my lord. The peddler hasn't been by in months."

"It's not difficult to make," Salazar said grumpily. "You just need fat and wood ash."

The elder looked at him with awe. "If you could show us, we would be grateful."

Salazar frowned but nodded. "And you should build a public bath. It is more efficient for all of your kind to bathe after work, and it would curb the spread of parasites."

The elder fidgeted. "The church says bathing together tempts sin..."

Salazar perked up. "Yet it is a sin to waste, is it not? Think how much fuel and water you would save."

The elder nodded slowly. "You're very wise, my lord. Could you direct us in its building?"

Salazar nodded reluctantly. If he was to get any comfort around here, he would have to take matters into his own hands.

***

The village flourished under his guidance. New inhabitants arrived constantly, attracted by the rumors of its prosperity, and Salazar welcomed them as more souls to corrupt.

To no one's surprise but his, the elder offered him to marry his daughter, and Salazar eventually accepted. It was just a sham to cement his position of authority, he told himself with vague discomfort. Soon, very soon, he would reveal his true nature and throw the villagers into despair.

 They feasted and danced in his new home, the grandest in the village.

"I love you, Sal," his bride said, beaming in his arms.

"I... love you too," he lied. Perhaps he would wait just a little longer. A decade or two meant nothing to a being such as him.
