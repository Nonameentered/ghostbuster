Max tensed his lower body against the g-forces and took short, rapid breaths. The status display was a sea of red, with more damage appearing by the second under the onslaught of Cylian lasers. Orion was but a scouting vessel and couldn't match a genuine warship.

"Ablation shields are 90% depleted." Athena's usually prim voice sounded uneasy. "Twenty seconds before hull breach."

Max clenched the chair handle. "We need more speed!"

"Impossible, captain," Apollo said apologetically. "The engines are already loaded beyond capacity."

Max gnawed on his lip, and coming to a split-second decision, flipped up the cover plate over a button he had hoped he would never need to use. Athena and Apollo erupted in protest, but he heedlessly pressed his thumb to the button's biometric sensor, and their voices were drowned out by a discordant shriek of joy.

Regulations mandated that all military spaceships be equipped with three AIs. Two performed day-to-day operations, while the third could only be activated as a last resort. Max didn't see what it could do against an alien warship three times Orion's size, but it wasn't like he had a choice.

"Morning to you too, Gruuz," he muttered, glaring at the Cylian craft. "As you can see, we're in a bit of a pickle."

"#(($($," Gruuz said reassuringly.

The engines roared, and Max was squeezed down into his chair. Orion accelerated, briefly escaping the lances of Cylian lasers before they refocused again.

 "Weren't the engines operating at max?" he choked out.

"They *were*," Apollo said. "A runaway fusion reaction was triggered—"

"Torpedo launches detected," Athena interrupted. "Ten... Fifteen... Twenty...."

Max swore as twenty-odd dots erupted on the threat display, their plotted trajectories converging on Orion. Worse yet, the ship was hurtling to meet them head-on. "Gruuz," he cried, "what the hell are you doing?"

"%^#$&," Gruuz said and cackled loudly.

Max desperately reached for the button to shut down the insane AI, but the g-force squeezed down on him so heavily he couldn't lift a finger. All he could do was watch helplessly as the torpedoes drew ever closer.

"Ablation shields depleted," Athena said. "The lasers are damaging the hull."

"Change course," Max choked out. "Evasive maneuvers!"

"I am unable to take control," Apollo said. "Captain, it has been an honor serving with you."

"@*#*," Gruuz said disdainfully.

An explosion rocked the ship, rattling Max's teeth. He shook himself off and gaped at the display. The lasers had burned through the hull of the living quarters—empty now that everyone was in their battle stations—and all the furniture and personal effects were ejected into space along with the air. The torpedoes winked out one by one as they encountered the debris.

"The debris is acting as chaff," Athena said incredulously. "Our armaments are sufficient to destroy the torpedoes that slip through."

Max barked a laugh. "You crazy son of a bitch!"

"!#%$&," Gruuz said smugly. 

Max groaned as the roar of the engines redoubled, causing his weight to triple and quadruple in seconds. The ship had been knocked off course by the explosion, but the mad AI sent it accelerating toward the Cylian craft again. The aliens were... Max blinked. They were trying to *flee*. 

"Collision imminent," Athena said urgently. "My models predict mutual annihilation."

"Engine containment is rapidly failing," Apollo said.

"$*%R*!" Gruuz cheered.

The roar grew deafening, and the ship vibrated so badly it seemed to be coming apart at the seams. Max's eyes—the only part of his body he could still move—were fixed on the predicted trajectory that ended in collision. "Go get them," he whispered, hardly registering the panicked screams of the other two AIs.

Moments from collision, the side-thrusters activated, and Orion swiveled about its axis so violently that Max nearly blacked out. Another explosion rocked the ship, and blackness consumed the bridge before red emergency lights blinked on. Escaping air hissed somewhere nearby.

"Situation?" Max wheezed, scanning the flickering status display. The sight seemed impossible. The Cylian warship was but a melted husk. Orion was in shambles, its engines not so much damaged as just gone, but incredibly, the crew stations were all intact.

"The engines' magnetic containment failed catastrophically," Apollo said mournfully.

"The ensuing excursion has destroyed the hostile vessel," Athena said, awed.

"$$$$@," Gruuz said with deep satisfaction and fell asleep.
