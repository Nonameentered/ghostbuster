Olkin observed the proceedings with mounting curiosity, and the moment Nezulu was cleared of any wrongdoing, he slithered toward her with all speed his tentacles could muster. Unlike he, she had to wear a bulky oxygen mask in the station's atmosphere and didn't see him until he caught up with her.

"Ambassador Nezulu," he said. "I greet you."

"I greet you, Ambassador Olkin," she returned politely. "Did you need something?"

"Well," he said, gesturing toward the podium she had just left, "I must admit to some curiosity as to what happened. How did you end up exterminating an entire species? Your kind isn't known for its belligerence."

Nezulu's face colored; Olkin had known her long enough to recognize embarrassment. "I'm not sure I want to talk about it, Olkin. By the stars, I still shudder at the memories."

His tentacles undulated. "You're making me even more curious. Come, I'll buy you a drink, and you simply must tell me about it."

Nezulu sighed and gave in; he suspected she had wanted to talk and was only looking for an excuse. They found a bar, and he paid for a drink in a hermetic can that she sipped through a straw. He waited with the patience afforded to a species that lived for millennia.

"You know how outwardly similar we are to these humans," she said at length, distaste dripping from her voice. "Two legs, two arms, a head, even..." She swept her hand at the protuberances on her chest he never bothered to learn the purpose of.

"I understand that was why you were chosen for their First Contact," Olkin said.

"That was a grave mistake." Taking a sip of her drink, she rubbed her temples. "Our approach was standard: connect to their digital networks, learn their language, and finally open communications. Things seemed to go well at first. We had a live video conference with their leaders... and then it went downhill."

She gazed off into space. "Mere hours later, the first... materials featuring us popped up on their networks. Pictures at first, then videos generated by unexpectedly sophisticated algorithms called deepfakes. They used our entire delegation as models, Olkin!"

"Perhaps that was their way of honoring you," Olkin said, confused. "What did these materials contain?"

"Heresy." The color in her cheeks intensified. "Copulation between our species and more profane acts I cannot bring myself to voice."

Olkin reeled back, his tentacles going still. "To what end?" he asked. "Even primitives must have realized that your genetic code wouldn't be compatible."

"We tried to understand. You know we would never immediately turn to destruction." Nezulu pushed aside her drink and shook her head. "Their species was fragmented into factions, yet the conception of such materials was codified in an universal law under rule 34. We demanded the creators to stop, yet they"—she buried her face in her palms—"they told us they wanted to *clap those alien cheeks*."

Olkin patted her shoulder with his tentacle. "By the stars, Nezulu," he said grimly, "you have done nothing wrong."
