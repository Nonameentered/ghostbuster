Rain fell in thick sheets, distorting the landscape, muddying the ground, and stealing the last warmth from Luke's bruised body. The straps of the rucksack filled to the brim with rocks scraped his shoulders, blood mixing with the rain and trickling down his dirty tunic. He staggered for several steps and collapsed face-first. Pushing himself up on his elbows, he gasped for air. 

The Hero's shoe slammed into the back of his head, grinding his face into the mud. "Pathetic," he spat. "Get up."

Luke raised his head and sputtered. "I can't."

"I said, get up." The Hero kicked him in the ribs. 

Luke rolled onto his back with an agonized groan. For months he had obeyed the Hero's every order, only to be beaten black and blue, to be mocked and humiliated, and it still wasn't enough. Never enough. Gritting his teeth, he slung off the rucksack and rose heavily to his feet.

The Hero motioned at the rucksack. "Pick it up."

"No!" Luke cried, glaring. To think he had looked up to the man not so long ago. Now he felt nothing but hatred. 

The Hero kicked his leg, sending him to his knees. "I said, pick it up. We're not done."

Luke reached for the rucksack, but rather than grab the straps, he slid his hand inside and pulled out a smooth, cold rock. With a strangled yell, he charged at the Hero. For a fleeting instant, he thought he glimpsed something like triumph cross the Hero's scarred face, but then it was gone, and the bastard's sheathed sword walloped him in the stomach, driving the air from his lungs.

He dropped to his knees. Through his teary eyes, he could see the Hero circling him, lecturing him, but he couldn't hear a thing through the roar in his ears. His bone-weary fatigue, even his pain seemed to retreat as hatred blazed inside him. He would kill the bastard if it was the last thing he did.

Luke reached for the knife he had hidden behind his belt and charged once more. The Hero lurched back, grunting in surprise as the knife scored a red line across his cheek. Howling, Luke slashed at him again and again, heedless of the blows he received in return, until even his anger could no longer move his exhausted body. He slumped forward, half-expecting to be run through by the Hero's sword, only to be caught in his arms.

"Well done," the Hero said.

"Why," Luke cried, "why?"

"What you will face out there are the worst monsters in the world," the Hero said, almost too softly to be heard through the rain. "They will offer no mercy, no respite, so neither did I." 

Luke shook his head furiously, loathing the very idea that this was meant to be a lesson. "I hate you," he spat. "I hate you, and when I'm strong enough, I'll kill you. This I swear."

The Hero laughed and pushed him away, leaving him swaying on his feet. His scarred face looked almost proud. "It wasn't bravery you lacked, nor sword techniques, nor strength. It was the willingness to kill. You learned that today." 

He turned and left, leaving Luke screaming in impotent rage at his retreating back.
