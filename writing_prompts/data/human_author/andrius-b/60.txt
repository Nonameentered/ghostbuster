"Okay, let's start with something easy," Jayden said, jerking his chin at a square block of concrete on the ground. "Try and lift it."

Bob sent him a dubious look. It was weird to think of a zitty teenager with violently green hair as his mentor, but that's how it was. Kids picked up this magic business faster, and he had to try and keep up.

"But what do I say?" he asked.

"You just..." Jayden gestured vaguely. "Let the magic flow through you, man. It's not a science but an art, you know?"

Bob didn't know, but that seemed to be all the advice he would get. He took a deep breath and thrust out his palm. "Stone and sand, heed me. By my command—um—arise."

The block didn't budge. Bob coughed in embarrassment.

Jayden groaned and slapped his forehead. "No, no, you have to be natural. None of that fantasy sounding shit. Just tell magic what you want."

"All right. All right, that I can do." He stared at the block as if to intimidate it. "Move!"

The block wiggled slightly. Bob gaped, then turned to Jayden. "Did you see that? It worked!"

"Yeah, good job," Jayden said, unimpressed. "But what's with that weak-ass spell? Try something with more feeling."

Bob furrowed his brow. "I thought you told me to speak naturally."

"Yeah, but like..." Jayden scratched his head. "It's easier to show you, I guess. Watch this." He faced the block and thrust up his arms. "Lightweight, baby!"

Bob gasped and stepped back as the block shot up into the air. After all this time, he still wasn't used to such casual displays of magic. "That's amazing."

"You ain't seen nothing yet," Jayden said, grinning. "Yeet!"

The block shot forward, arcing across the practice field, and thudded on the grass a good hundred feet away. Bob stared, awed, then shook his head.

"Do I have to yell *yeet* each time?" he asked weakly.

"Well, no, but that's what works best." Jayden dusted off his palms as if he had lifted the block by hand. "It's like, when people use a word a lot, it imprints itself onto the fabric of magic. Haven't you read the brochures?"

Bob felt his stomach sink. "Say I wanted to find out who stole my lunch at work. What spell could I use?"

Jayden snorted. "If someone's looking sus, just do a vibe check."

"A vibe check," he repeated blankly. "Right. What if I was, say, late for a train?"

"Easy, man." Jayden raised a palm and slid it sideways. "Make it *skrrt*."

"Defend myself from a mugger?"

"You could go *catch these hands*!" Jayden punched the air, sending off a ghostly imprint of his fist.

Bob sighed deeply and peered across the field where the concrete block lay on the ground. Having such a power would be amazing, but not at this cost. "You know what? I don't think magic is for me after all."
