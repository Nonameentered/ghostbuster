Peter jolted awake and blinked at the patchwork ceiling of his tent. The fabric fluttered in the ever-present winds, and the netting under his back thrummed with tension. There had been a catch, a big one.

He unstrapped himself from his cot, pulled a worn toothbrush and half a bottle of water from a pocket in the wall, and quickly brushed his teeth. Unzipping the tent, he clambered outside.

The Net sloped down before him, stretched into the shape of a bowl by the weight of the night's catch. Along its rim stood dozens of tents much like Peter's, rough and sewn with varied skill. Ropes stretched from the Net's edges, connecting to taut squares of canvas that slowed them down enough to catch the bounty raining from above.

Across the Net, old man Henry stuck out his grizzly head from his tent. Peter waved in greeting, grabbed his rucksack, and clambered downslope on all fours. First-come first-serve was the rule, and although the people wouldn't let each other starve, arguments sometimes broke out over things like alcohol and other luxuries.

The fabric flexed under him, torn and patched in too many places to count, and through the gaps, he could see things big and small glittering in the strange omnidirectional light as they fell eternally into the void. Two years ago, the sight would have made him dizzy. Now he just grimaced ruefully whenever he glimpsed something good that had slipped past the Net to be forever lost.

The night's catch had slid to the bottom of the Net in a messy pile. An old armchair, a sooty tailpipe, a still-green oaken branch... He perked up when he glimpsed a metal can and pulled it out eagerly. Beans in tomato sauce; not bad.

Spying others descending the slope, Peter rummaged faster. His rucksack grew heavy with bottled water, a bunch of bruised bananas, and an MRE dating back to the nineties. What luxury!

He tugged aside the armchair—they would have to haul it overboard today—and froze when he saw an arm sticking out from the depths of the pile. It was a pale delicate arm whose nails were marked by red remains of nail polish. He reached out, hesitated, then grasped the hand carefully. Still warm.

"We have a fallen!" he yelled, raising his head. "Help me out!"

The others clambered down to join him and set to picking apart the pile, putting their hunger aside for the moment. At the bottom they found a young woman in her nightclothes wrapped in a blanket. She was bruised but still breathing, and Edith, the only one of them with any medical knowledge, assured them that she wasn't seriously hurt.

Indeed, the stranger soon cracked open her eyes and blinked at the surrounding people. Inhaling sharply, she bolted into a seating position and screamed. Edith hugged her around the shoulders and held her down.

"L-let go!" the stranger cried. "I'm falling! We're falling!"

"And ye will be for the rest of yer life," old man Henry said in a gravelly voice. "So ye better get used to it."

The woman panted, her eyes darting around in a panic. When she glanced down and saw the void through a gap in the fabric, she blanched and shuddered.

"Don't look down yet," Peter said. "Keep your eyes on the Net. Here"—he reached into his rucksack—"have some water."

The woman accepted the bottle with her trembling hands and took several shaky gulps. Peter winced as some of the precious water sloshed down her chin. Well, she would learn to conserve soon. They all did.

"Where..." She took a shuddering breath and peered up at Peter. "Where am I?"

"A place where everything that is lost ends up," he said quietly. "We call it the Abyss."
