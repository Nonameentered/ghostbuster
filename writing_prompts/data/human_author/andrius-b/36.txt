Eleanor knew the palace was alive since she was but a child, racing through its hallways and hiding in the gardens and driving her caretakers spare. She couldn't understand why they would worry. If she got lost, there always came that whisper at the edge of hearing, a gust of wind like a friendly nudge on the shoulder, that helped her find her way.

Her mother once told her that within the palace dwelled the spirit of their ancestors, and that they would watch over her always.

Those careless days were far behind. A terrible enemy encroached upon the land, devouring town after town. The war took her brothers first, then her father, and the heartbreak proved too much for her mother. Before she knew it, Eleanor was bowing before the bishop to take up the crown, and it felt horribly heavy upon her brow.

The faces of her advisors were grim, and their number dwindled by the day. The palace emptied as first the courtiers fled, then the servants, then the guards. Soon Eleanor sat alone in the silent throne room, gripping the cold crown in her fingers and waiting for the end.

Screams and fire heralded the enemy's arrival. They surged through the beautiful city, fouling the streets with blood and smoke, and finally came for the palace, their swords red and their eyes burning with greed.

And though it lay abandoned, the palace gates swung shut, and ceremonial suits of armor lining the halls raised their halberds in its defense. The invaders fell upon them in droves and were rebuffed again and again. As the palace shook under siege, a gilded tapestry fell from the wall and draped itself over Eleanor's trembling shoulders.

"Safe," the palace whispered, cradling her as a mother would. "I'll keep you safe."
