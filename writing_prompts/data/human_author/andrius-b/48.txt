The captain admired the white-and-blue planet on the main display. It orbited at the outer edge of the G9V star's habitable zone, so two thirds of its surface were covered in ice, but there was liquid water by the equator. An incredible bounty, well worth centuries of travel under cold sleep.

"Scan for life signs," he ordered, not moving his gaze away from the screen.

"That's not how science works," scoffed the engineer.

The captain sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. "Scan for radio signals. Check if there are any organic compounds in the atmosphere. Search for landforms that might be artificial in nature. Can you do that for me?"

"On it," the engineer said, stooping over the console. "You should have just said so from the start."

The captain sent him a glare. "You do realize we're being recorded. Millions of our descendants who will live on that planet are going to watch these very moments."

The engineer shrugged. "All the more reason to formulate your orders accurately."

The captain took a deep breath. *Patience*. The man was lucky he was such a brilliant engineer, or he would be sleeping in his cryopod until the end of history.
