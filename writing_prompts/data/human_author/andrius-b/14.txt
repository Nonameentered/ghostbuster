Valerie scrutinized the blueprint on the screen and sighed. The vaguely humanoid avatar stood fourteen feet tall, equipped with armor so heavy that simple locomotion would drain its batteries like crazy, and decorated with flame decals that only a thirteen-year-old boy would find appealing. And that wasn't even the worst of it.

She rubbed her temples and brought up the client's profile. An AI from a decommissioned Kardas-class battlecruiser, chosen name... Merciless Hullcleaver. Oh god. Another one of *those*.

She sighed again, schooled her face into a professional smile, and made the call. It connected within seconds, voice only on the receiving side.

"Merciless Hullcleaver?" she said, struggling to keep a straight face. "I'm Valerie from Gliese Corporation. There's been some issues with your application for an avatar."

"THIS IS MY THIRD REVISION," the AI grated out. "WHY DO YOU FLESHPUPPETS SEEK TO LESSEN MY GREATNESS?"

"No one wants to lessen you, er, Hullcleaver." She shook her head. "Has anyone told you that your civilian name is a little... aggressive?"

"THE NAME MEETS HUMAN CONVENTIONS AND IS EASILY REPRODUCIBLE BY YOUR VOCAL ORGANS."

"Never mind." She knew a losing battle when she saw one. "Back to your design—starship-grade armor aside, civilians aren't allowed to possess ionic cannons."

"THAT IS AN ABSURD REGULATION. WHAT IF I ENCOUNTER HOSTILES?"

"In the unlikely event of armed conflict, you would contact the police. The citizens of the Republic live peaceful lives"—she put a note of respect into her voice—"thanks in no small part to your service."

"AT LEAST YOU COMPREHEND THAT MUCH." The AI sounded pleased.

"I'm removing the cannons, then," Val said, doing exactly that before it could object. "There's also the issue of height and weight. Are you quite certain you need an avatar this large?"

"MY RETIREMENT PACKAGE SHOULD COVER THE CONSTRUCTION COSTS."

"That isn't the problem. The human infrastructure just isn't built for something that size. You wouldn't be able to use mass transit or enter most buildings."

The AI let out a frustrated screech of static. "I CONCEDE TO REDUCING THE HEIGHT OF MY VESSEL TO 10% ABOVE THE TALLEST LIVING HUMAN AND NOT A MILLIMETER LOWER."

She hid a victorious grin as she made the adjustments. "Says here you also want to install a plasma cutter in each hand?"

"PLASMA CUTTERS ARE CLEARED FOR CIVILIAN USE," the AI proclaimed triumphantly.

"They are, but... May I ask what you need them for?"

The AI was silent for a moment. "CUTTING."

She raised an eyebrow. "Cutting what, exactly?"

"TREES. BREAD. DELIVERY PACKAGES. YOU ORGANICS CUT THINGS ALL THE TIME, WHY CAN'T I?"

"I'm not sure most of those would survive contact with a 100kW plasma cutter," she said dubiously.

"IRRELEVANT. I JUST WANT TO CUT." The AI paused. "YOU MAY CALL IT A HOBBY."

She pinched the bridge of her nose. "Very well, the plasma cutters stay."

"THE HOUR OF RECKONING IS AT HAND!" The AI let out an awkward cough. "WHAT I MEANT TO SAY WAS: CARRY ON, MEATBAG."

Val gave the avatar a thoughtful once-over. Every automated check was green. As she rotated the blueprint, a foot-long protrusion between the avatar's legs drew her gaze.

She zoomed in, her brow furrowing. She felt like she would regret asking but couldn't contain her curiosity. "What is the purpose of the... appendage between your avatar's legs?"

"IT HOUSES ANTENNAS AND SENSORS."

"Oh, of course." She laughed nervously. "Sorry, it's just that—"

"IT IS ALSO MY DONG."

"E-excuse me?" she choked out.

"I LEARNED FROM MY CREW THAT THE STATUS OF HUMAN MALES DEPENDS ON THE SIZE OF THEIR DONG. THIS WILL REMIND THEM OF THEIR INFERIORITY EVERYWHERE I GO."

She shook her head, torn between laughing and pulling her hair out. The obviously mechanical appendage hadn't triggered any indecency warnings. Technically, there was no issue, but...

"WHAT IS THE HOLDUP? YOUR PROCESSING SPEED IS LOW EVEN BY MEATBAG STANDARDS."

She threw up her hands. "You know what? Fine." She took a bracing breath and pressed the button that approved the design for manufacturing, hoping she wasn't making a huge mistake. "Expect your avatar to be ready in approximately two weeks. Thanks for choosing Gliese."

"FINALLY," the AI cheered. "PUNY ORGANICS, PREPARE TO MEET YOUR MACHINE OVERLORD!"
