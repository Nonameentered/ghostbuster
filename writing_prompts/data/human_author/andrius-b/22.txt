The living room lay in shambles. The couch was turned over, the television smashed, and the coffee table broken, but the most striking was the toothy maw sketched on the floor in coagulated blood. Mary sank to her knees, clasping a hand over her mouth. Christopher absently patted her shoulder as he scanned the room. A trail of red droplets leading to the hallway. A faint smudge where a tiny hand brushed the wall. His jaw tightened.

"Jacob," Mary sobbed. "Oh my god, Jacob. Jacob! Where are you?"

"Don't bother," Christopher said. "They'll have taken him."

"They?" She pulled out her phone with trembling hands. "We have to call the policeâ€”"

He laid his palm over the screen. "Police won't help. Not against those people."

She shook her head. "Chris, what are you talking about?"

He took her by the shoulders. "Mary, there's something I haven't told you. I..." He trailed off, unable to finish the sentence the same way he hadn't been able to a hundred times before. "Come with me."

He strode to the basement and descended the stairs at speed. His wife, although terrified and confused, pattered after him. Her trust brought a faint smile to his lips, although it quickly faded. 

He ducked between shelves filled with tools and kick-knacks, and pressed his hand to the wall. A hidden panel slid away, revealing a small lens. He bent over it, allowing it to scan his retina.

The entire north wall slid down with a hiss of gas. Cool bright lights came on, revealing shelves bursting with exotic weaponry, computer equipment, and at the center, his old suit.

Mary gave a hysterical laugh. "Chris, what is all this?"

He bent over the computer and activated the surveillance drones he had hidden around the neighborhood. "Remember what I told you about my old job?"

"Of course I remember," she said, tiptoeing inside and looking around warily. "Neutralizing rogue heroes for the Agency. You never liked talking about it."

"I did fight heroes," he said wryly. "Although it was on the other side of the fence."

He could feel her gaze burning a hole into his back. He kept his eyes on the screen, casting a widening search net over the neighborhood. Within a minute, he found a trail: a black van had driven past half an hour ago, ending its journey in an abandoned warehouse in the dock district.

"What do you mean, exactly?" she asked at last.

He met her gaze fleetingly. "You've never been stupid. I think you know already."

He stepped up to his suit and snapped his fingers. The armaments came alive, molding to his aging body as if twenty years hadn't passed, the grey superalloy turning him into something more than human. Last came the mask, perfectly smooth safe for the featureless holes for his eyes.

Her face paled in recognition. "Faceless," she whispered.

"I'm sorry I never told you," he said, his voice made harsh by the built-in modulator. Somehow, now that he wore the mask, the words came easier. "Do you hate me?" He turned away, not wanting to see the horror on her face.

There was a moment of silence. Then, to his shock, she stepped up to him and pressed a kiss under his jaw where steel didn't cover his flesh. "Maybe I will later," she said in a low voice. "But right now? Right now, I'm *grateful*. Give them hell, Chris. Bring our son back and give them hell for daring lay their hands on him."

He looked into her fierce eyes and found himself falling in love with her all over again. "Oh," he said darkly, "I intend to."
