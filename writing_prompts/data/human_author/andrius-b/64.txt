Griffith's funeral was a huge affair. The entire town gathered for the procession that brought the coffin to the graveyard, and nobles came from as far as the royal palace to pay respects. Then they left one by one, and only those closest to Griffith remained: his sons and daughters, many with families of their own, and his adventuring comrades, Alania and Durst. The pair were the only elf and dwarf in the proceedings, and no one seemed to know how to treat them. 

The feeling was mutual.

"I can't believe he's gone," Alania said, peering at the grave so laden with flowers one couldn't see the soil underneath. "It's hardly been a decade since I last visited. He seemed so strong still—white-haired and wrinkled, yes, but strong."

"I dropped by five years ago," Durst said in a low, gravelly voice. "It was the first time I beat him in arm-wrestling. That's how I knew it wouldn't be long."

"I brought him wine back then," Alania continued as if not having heard him. "We talked about traveling to the Southern Seas—you remember how he always said he wanted to see them. He told me that would be nice and laughed."

"He was joking," Durst said. "He must have thought you understood."

"Joking!" Alania said, aghast. "Why would he joke about it? I spent two years preparing for the trip. I was going to drop by and tell him soon."

"You know how humans are. Hardly live beyond seventy or eighty." Durst produced an enormous handkerchief and dabbed at his eyes. "Horrid pollen from those flowers."

Alania looked away. She thought she ought to cry too, but no tears came to her eyes. "I can't believe he's gone," she repeated. "What am I going to do now? I already made preparations."

A trumpet-like noise resounded as Durst blew his nose. "Well," he said gruffly, "why don't the two of us go?"

Alania looked at him in surprise. "To the Southern Seas?"

"Griffith always yammered on about them. Golden beaches and crystal-clear water as far as the eye could see." Durst snorted. "Sounds like no place for a dwarf, but his talk made me curious."

She thought for a minute, then another. Durst didn't hurry her, knowing that her mind was brilliant but didn't always work at the same pace as his.

"Yes," she said at length. "Yes, let us go. Even though he is no longer here..." A pensive smile curved her lips as she considered Griffith's many offspring. "We'll go see the Southern Seas, and I'll write an epic poem about it and bring it to his children."

Durst made a face, then nodded grudgingly. "They might like that."

"Then it's decided." Alania looked up at the sky, feeling restlessness grip her for the first time in decades. Then a thought occurred to her that made her turn to Durst in alarm. "Won't they be gone too, by the time we return?"

Durst snorted into his beard. "They're humans, not flies. We have three, maybe four decades."

Alania perked up. "That's plenty of time to cross the seas. We could go to the Eastern Mountains afterward, where we slew the dragon."

"Why, we might as well see the whole damn thing," Durst said with a gleam in his eyes. "Everywhere we went during our adventures—and we'll cap the journey off with the South that he never got to see."

"Let's do that," Alania said softly. "I feel like he would've liked that." She looked at the grave, and her eyes stung just a little.
