The hero was a whirl of steel as he fended off the ungainly attacks of the skeletons. The necromancer who had raised me inched backward into the cave, and I interspersed myself between him and the hero protectively. The skeletons fell to the hero's blade one by one, collapsing into piles of bones. 

Seeing a gap in the throng around the hero, I lunged forward and swung my rusty sword. The hero parried it effortlessly and responded with a lightning-fast riposte. 

I wasn't afraid and wasn't sure I could be. I did, however, feel faintly surprised when the tip of the gleaming blade paused an inch before my skull. The hero was staring at the rotting wooden amulet hanging from my neck that I hadn't bothered to cast off after my raising.

"Alice," he murmured, his eyes glimmering.

I raised my sword and swung again. The hero barely parried it in time, the tip scoring a thin gash along his arm. The next moment, he kicked me away and sprang toward my retreating master. There was a cry, and a gurgle, and I felt the magic binding me dissipate.

I looked down at my bony fingers. It was a strange feeling. The dark magic still sustained me, but it was directionless. I found myself free to act as I wanted and wasn't sure I liked the feeling.

The hero went around the cave methodically bashing in the skulls of the others as they milled about aimlessly. I looked at him, and he looked at me. 

"What's your name?" he asked at length.

I shook my head with a creak. "I don't have one."

"I see." He sniffed and rubbed his eyes, then extended his gauntleted hand. "Won't you come with me?"

"Will you be my new master?" I asked, struggling to understand what was going on.

The hero seemed almost angry. "No! We'll be friends. We'll fight together. We'll visit many new lands and meet great magicians and then maybe..." He trailed off, looking away.

I glanced at the bones littering the cave floor. I didn't understand many things, but I understood fighting together. Alone I was very weak. He was strong. "Friends," I said, touching his hand with my bony fingers. 

The hero clasped my hand and beamed, making my empty chest ache strangely.
