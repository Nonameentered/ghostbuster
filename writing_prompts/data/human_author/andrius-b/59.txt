Dave, or Quarter Pounder Demon as he was known by others, unwrapped the grease-stained bag and gasped. To the average person, it would have looked like a regular burger, but he knew that it was a heavenly treasure as rare as szechuan sauce. When he consumed it, he would gain at least a hundred years' worth of qi!

He reached for the McGuffin, only to leap back when he sensed killing intent. A gleaming spatula sliced through the space where his arm had just been. Before him stood the Grilled Cheese Dragon, a loathsome fellow from the Five Sages sect whose greed knew no bounds!

"So you also covet the McGuffin," Dave spat.

"*Hmph*." Grilled Cheese Dragon stared at him arrogantly. "It is a treasure far too great for trash like you. I will claim it and become unrivaled under the golden arches!"

Dave readied his stance. "You have eyes but you fail to recognize Mount Burger. The McGuffin will be mine!"

Grilled Cheese Dragon raised his spatula and lunged at him at an astonishing speed. "I will crush you in the time it takes to drink a cup of coke!"

Dave's eyes widened as he deflected the attack with a McDouble Palm Strike. The entire room shook under pressure of their clash. This loathsome fellow had to have consumed many combo meals to cultivate so quickly!

"You fool," Grilled Cheese Dragon sneered. "To challenge someone in the Transcendent Adipose Realm with your level of strength is to court death!"

The spatula blurred in the technique of Heavenly Flipping Patties, and Dave lurched back, coughing blood. Just a graze from its greasy blade had caused an internal injury.

"Beg on your knees, and I'll let you go," Dragon taunted. "To fight me further is to go against the order of burger and fries."

Dave wiped the blood from his lips and laughed. "Then I will overturn that order!"

What that foolish fellow didn't know was that Dave was cultivating Divine Bacon Qi, which allowed him to fight someone a realm above his! He unleashed his aura that spread through the room like wave and sprang forward. His aura-coated fists and Grilled Cheese Dragon's spatula clashed in a series of strikes too fast for the eye to see. The floor crumbled and the ceiling cracked. The Grilled Cheese Dragon's expression became desperate as Dave's strikes grew heavier until his fist slipped under the spatula and struck him in the heart.

"I-impossible," Grilled Cheese Dragon stammered, collapsing to his knees. He was bleeding from the seven orifices because his dantian was shattered. Truly a dog's death.

Dave turned his back to him and approached the table where the McGuffin lay. He picked it up and took an eager bite. It tasted so divine it was hard not to swallow his own tongue with it! He smiled as energy flowed through his meridians. He needed to enter closed door training immediately and assimilate it.
