The two parties gathered around the straw bed, their wary gazes alternating between one another and the snoozing toddler. The child's parents had likely perished in the recent avalanche, but his dual heritage was evident in his stocky build and short pointed ears. Elanor's stomach churned with emotion: shame at her lost kin for consorting with a dwarf, protectiveness for the child, and above all, sheer astonishment. A union between a dwarf and elf, if it happened at all, never bore fruit before.

"It's an abomination," murmured her underling.

"Here now," boomed Torsten, the leader of the dwarves, "don't go around calling an innocent babe such things."

"The master dwarf right," Elanor said sharply. "A child is not responsible for the sins of his parents."

Her underling squirmed uncomfortably and bowed. The toddler, awoken by their voices, stirred and broke into loud cries. Elanor tutted and leaned in to comfort him, but Torsten was first.

"It's all right, little fella," he crooned in a voice like gravel being crushed. "The knife-ears didn't mean anything by it." Extending his thick finger, he tickled the toddler's belly.

"Careful, you brute," Elanor exclaimed. "Babies are delicate!"

"Not dwarven ones," Torsten said proudly. "Look how strongly he grips my finger! He will wield a hammer one day, I wager."

"You are talking nonsense, master dwarf," Elanor said. "Once he grows up, the child will be taught archery and magic and poetry." She reached toward the toddler and smiled when he let go of the dwarf's fingers to feel hers.

"I thought you didn't want him," Torsten grunted, peering at her obliquely. "Calling him abomination and such."

Elanor inclined her head grudgingly. "We were too hasty. The child is of our blood, diluted as it is." 

Torsten drew up and hooked his thumbs behind his belt. "Well, you're not spiriting him away to your forests. He's our blood too, and we take care of our own."

Elanor straightened up, but although she towered over the dwarf, he did not seem intimidated. The dwarves' hairy hands inched toward their axes, and Elanor's kin began slinging off their bows.

The toddler's cry broke the stand-off, and forgetting their differences, elves and dwarves alike jumped in to fuss over him. Concluding that the child was hungry, they offered him what meager rations they had. Elanor smiled triumphantly when the child chose the fragrant elven bread over the rock-hard dwarven jerky. Then it was Torsten's turn to gloat when the child inexplicably turned his nose up at the forest dew the elves carried in their canteens but eagerly swallowed the fermented milk whose smell made Elanor's nose wrinkle in disgust.

"Perhaps we can come to a compromise," Torsten said, stroking his beard.

Elanor wanted to rebuff him immediately, but one look at the giggling toddler softened her resolve. "Perhaps we can."
