Nick slowly stepped into the closet, eyeing the walls plastered with dozens of photos of him stretching all the way back to middle school. His family and friends had been meticulously cut out, leaving only him, and there were little hearts drawn all over.

A floorboard creaked behind him, and the light bulb overhead suddenly died, leaving him in the dark. He whirled around. Yana stood in the doorway, outlined against the light from outside, her head ducked so that her black hair draped over her face. In her hand she held a box cutter whose blade she exposed notch by notch. *Click*, *click*, *click*.

"You saw?" she asked hollowly.

"Yeah, my bad," he said apologetically. "This was supposed to be a surprise, right? I know my birthday's still two weeks away."

Yana looked up at him through the fringe of her hair. "You're... not upset?"

"I'm flattered, really," he said. "Where did you even get all those photos?"

And a faraway look came over her dark eyes. "Your classmates. Friends. Yearbooks. We were in the same middle school." Her gaze focused on him with a sudden intensity. "I've been watching you ever since."

"Same school? Man, I never knew." He patted her on the head. "Anyway, that must've taken a lot of work. Next time you can just get me a pair of headphones or something."

"I'll... keep that in mind," she mumbled, the corners of her lips curving up.

"Now, what's with the box cutter?" He caught her wrist and lifted it with a frown. "You made the blade way too long. Gotta be careful with these things, they break easily." He laid his fingers over hers and retracted the blade. "There. What did you need to cut?"

"N-nevermind that now," she said, blushing. 

"Okay then." He shrugged and stepped around her into the hallway. "Thanks for letting me use your restroom. I'll call you soon, alright?"

Taking her by the shoulders, he leaned down to kiss her. The box cutter clattered to the floor as she met him halfway, turning the innocent peck into something fierce. Breaking apart, she stared at him with narrowed eyes.

"I'm letting you go now," she said in a low voice. "But just so you know, you won't be able to escape me." She produced a silver key. "I already made a copy of your house key."

"Oh. I didn't realize we were at that stage already." He smiled. "Sorry about the trouble, I should've given you a spare."

Yana's dark lashes fluttered as she stared at him in surprise. "On second thought," she said, gripping the front of his shirt, "I won't be letting you go just yet. I'll have your babies so you can never leave me."

Nick blushed and tugged at his collar. "Oh, wow. Anyone ever tell you you're refreshingly direct?"

"Upstairs," she growled, tugging him along.

"Yes, ma'am," Nick said happily.
