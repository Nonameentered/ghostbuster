The theater was half-empty, so Adam and Rachia had their pick of the seats. He preceded her down an aisle and sat down in the middle, resting the tub of popcorn on his lap. She glided after him and settled down beside him, taking a moment to arrange her tentacles atop the seat. She flashed him an eager grin before the lights dimmed and a trailer for an upcoming action flick started to play.

Adam tossed a buttery popcorn into his mouth and glanced at her. She was practically quivering in excitement as her W-shaped pupils tracked what was happening on the screen. He smiled.

"What?" she asked, sensing his gaze.

"You're cute."

Her cheeks cycled through a blush of blue, purple, and red. "Oh, shut up," she murmured, returning her gaze to the screen.

Adam's smile widened. Rachia sent him a side-glance, sighed, and gripped his hand, her cheeks now positively glowing in the dark.

The trailers ended, and the movie came on—a horror flick Adam had wanted to see. The premise was cliche, but the heroine was likable and resourceful, and the otherwordly slasher was properly creepy. He reached into the popcorn tub and paused in surprise when he encountered Rachia's tentacle. She used it to bring the popcorn to her mouth in lieu of her hand, which was busy clutching his so tightly his bones creaked.

The heroine panted as she ran through an abandoned house. As the music reached a crescendo, the slasher popped up in all his eerie glory. Rachia squeaked and clamped a hand over her mouth. Something wet splattered Adam's face, and he frowned, raising his hand to his cheek.

"Sorry, I'm so sorry," Rachia whispered frantically. "Let me get a tissue..." She stuffed several tentacles into her handbag and rummaged inside.

He chuckled under his breath; so it was just her ink. "No worries," he muttered. "We'll wash it off later."

She dabbed at his cheek. "But—"

"Never mind that," he said, squeezing her hand. "Let's just enjoy the movie."

She nodded, glowing in embarrassment, and returned her attention to the screen. As the heroine escaped increasingly dire predicaments, her face cycled through most of the colors of the rainbow. Her tentacles wrapped around his legs as if of their own accord until she was clinging onto him for dear life. Despite her obvious fear, her W-shaped pupils remained glued to the screen

In the end, the slasher met a terrible end, and the heroine survived to see the dawn. Rachia released a shuddering breath and loosened her death grip on his hand.

"That was pretty good, wasn't it?" he asked.

"Good? I *inked* myself!" She flushed and lowered her voice. "But yes, it was pretty good." 

The lights came on, and the scant patrons filtered out of the theater. Adam glanced at Rachia expectantly. She blinked at her tentacles, still tangled over his legs, and hurriedly withdrew them.

"Oh god," she groaned, "I was so scared I didn't even notice. Why didn't you say anything?"

"I didn't mind. It felt kind of nice, being wrapped by you."

She slapped his shoulder, blushing. "Weirdo."

"Isn't that what you like about me?" He rose and offered her his hand. "How about we grab some sushi?"

She clasped it, smiling. "*After* you go to the bathroom and wash my ink off your cheek."
