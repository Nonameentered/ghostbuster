An annoyingly cheerful melody roused Tom from his dreams. He groaned and reached blindly for the alarm clock. It wasn't in its usual spot, and his irritation mounted as the melody played on. Today wasn't even a school day; he just forgot to turn the damn thing off last night.

A sharp *thwack* resounded, cutting off the melody. He cracked open his eyes and stared. The alarm clock lay in ruins atop the nightstand. A shadowy tentacle hovered over it, extending from under his blanket.

A scream burst from his mouth, and he rolled out of the bed. Wrestling off his blanket, he tugged at the tentacle and yelped in pain. 

It wasn't an alien beast come to devour him. Rather, the tentacle felt like his own flesh, extending from somewhere around his lower back. His heart pounded in his chest as he traced it to the spot where it emerged from his body. *What the hell*?

Hurried footsteps fell outside. "Is everything all right, Tom?" his mother asked from behind the door.

He tried to get his breathing under control. "Y-yeah," he said, reaching for his blanket. The tentacle helpfully shot forth and yanked it toward him, making him exclaim in surprise.

"Tom, I'm coming in," mother said urgently. 

He yelled and tried to cover himself up. Mom saw the tentacle he was trying to hide and screamed too. Then her expression suddenly changed.

"Oh, thank god," she said, laying a hand on her chest. "I thought I walked in on some weird masturbation thing."

"A weird... How is *this* better?" Tom asked, wiggling his new limb agitatedly.

"The heritage had to make itself known sooner or later." Taking a deep breath, she sat on his bed and patted a spot beside her. "Tom, calm down and listen. You remember what I told you about your father?"

He shook his head in bewilderment. "Sure I remember," he said, sitting down beside her. His heart still raced, but mother's strange nonchalance was calming him down a little. "He was from Canada, right?"

Mother made a complicated expression. "That... wasn't strictly true." She looked away and dropped her voice. "He wasn't even from Earth."

"He *what*?" Tom demanded.

She fidgeted with her fingers. "Or even human. I was quite active in the occult space in my youth, you see, and summoning otherwordly entities was quite the rage those days. One thing led to another, and..."

"You've got to be kidding," he said incredulously.

"I know it's hard to believe, but it's not like there's a regular explanation for this, is there?" She glanced at his tentacle. "Don't worry about it too much. You'll learn to hide it, and who knows, it might come in handy someday."

"I... this is a lot to take in, you know?" He rubbed his forehead. "My father... Who was he? What was he truly like?"

Mother gazed off into space. "Oh, not at all like us. He was an ever-shifting clump of darkness you could lose yourself in if you watched it too long." A faint blush rose to her cheeks. "And he did this thing with his tentacles..."

"*Mom*!" Tom groaned and rubbed his temples. "God, I wish I could unhear that. Just get out of my room, I'll be fine now."
