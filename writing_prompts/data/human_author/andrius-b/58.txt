Adam shifted on his chair and eyed the other kids sitting in a half-circle before the camp director. A freckled girl was whispering something to the empty air beside her. A long-haired boy about his age was breaking a twig into progressively smaller pieces. A pale girl with dark eyes devoid of emotion was staring into space, but upon sensing his gaze, she slowly swiveled to him. He shuddered and looked away.

The director clapped, making him flinch. "Now that we're all here, how about some introductions? My name is Kathy, and I'm here to make Oakshade Camp as fun as possible for you."

"*Fun*?" rasped the boy with the twig. "I know why we're here."

The director turned to him. "And why do you think that is, Colin?"

"Because there's something wrong with us."

Sympathy crossed her face. "Is that what your parents told you?"

Colin pursed his lips and looked away.

Kathy ran her gaze over each of them. "I want all of you to know that I'm on your side. You're safe here." She lowered her voice. "Tell me, Colin. Why do you think there's something wrong with you?"

The boy ducked his head. "I start fires sometimes," he muttered. "My parents think I'm doing it on purpose. I'm not! It just... happens. When I'm angry or scared."

Kathy smiled. "Thanks for telling me."

Colin's head jerked up. "You believe me?"

"I do. You're special, Colin. I think this camp can help you learn control your ability."

His eyes flashed red. "Awesome."

Adam blinked. Must've been just a trick of light.

"Now," Kathy said, "who wants to go next?"

The freckled girl raised her hand timidly. 

"Yes, Amanda?"

The girl fidgeted and looked at the spot beside her. "Everyone says Mr. Skellig isn't real, but I know he is. Will you believe me too?"

"Mr. Skellig, huh." Kathy considered the spot the girl was looking at. "He's quite a tall gentleman, isn't he?"

"You can see him?" Amanda gasped, jumping up from her chair.

"Just a little. With enough practice, I think you can help your friend show himself to everyone here."

"Wow," Amanda said, sitting back. "Isn't that great, Mr. Skellig?"

Adam frowned at the spot everyone was looking at. For a moment, the air seemed to ripple and coalesce into an unnaturally tall figure with spider-like fingers. He gasped and recoiled, and it was gone.

Kathy turned her attention on him. "How about you, Adam? Want to tell us why you're here?"

Adam really didn't want to, but there was something about the director that made him trust her. "Well... I drew some pictures, and now my mom thinks I'm, like, disturbed."

"What kind of pictures?"

"Just... demons and stuff."

"Oh my," she said, sounding excited. "Did these demons appear before you in a dream?"

He shook his head in befuddlement.

"Then were you trying to summon them?"

"Summon?" He snorted. "Everyone knows demons aren't real. I was just drawing a comic, but then my mom found it and freaked out. She's religious and stuff."

"I see." Kathy tapped her finger against the chair. "Let's forget the drawings. Is there anything else that makes your parents worried?"

"Well... my math grades kind of suck."

Kathy shook her head. "No, no. I mean like a dark secret. Something you can't tell anyone else." She must've read something in his expression, because she leaned forward eagerly. "Do you have anything like that?"

Adam fidgeted, then sighed. "This one time," he said quietly, "I broke mom's favorite cup and blamed my little sister."

A silence stretched on. He swallowed, wondering if he had said something wrong. Then Kathy snorted and clamped her hand over her mouth.

"I'm sorry," she said quickly. "I was expecting something a little... darker. Don't worry. Most siblings have done something along those lines to each other."

He exhaled in relief. "Oh."

"Let's try another approach... Ever do bad things to animals?"

He shook his head frantically. From the corner of his eye, he saw the blank-eyed girl's lips curve into an eerie smile and shivered.

"Did your parents ever do bad things to you?"

"Well... mother drags me to church every Sunday... and they once grounded me for fighting at school..."

"Good lord," Kathy muttered. "There must be *something* for you to end up here... Ever wake up in an unfamiliar place not remembering how you got there?"

"Nope."

"Get a thirst for blood?"

"Ew, no!"

Kathy was starting to look desperate. "Wish for something very hard and then it comes true?"

"Well... I wished for a PlayStation and got it for Christmas, if that counts."

Kathy groaned and threw up her hands. "All right, that's enough. I'll be calling your parents and telling them to pick you up."

"Why?" Adam asked, his eyes widening. "What's wrong with me?"

"There's nothing wrong with you," Kathy said patiently. "You're a bright, well-adjusted, perfectly normal boy. And that's exactly why you don't belong here."
