Mark pushed open the doors of the Adventurer's Guild and trudged into the vast hall. His armor was stained with blood most of which wasn't his, and his legs were leaden after marching the entire day. Despite his weariness, he was triumphant. The serpent that terrorized the poor village had fallen to his sword. No one could ask for a better conclusion to their first quest.

He spied a free receptionist and walked up to the counter. Some of his weariness faded when she smiled at him brightly.

"Welcome back, adventurer," she chirped. "What news do you bring?"

He straightened his shoulders proudly. "I have completed my quest and slew the Red Serpent." Rummaging in his bag, he produced a message from the village elder as well as a large curved fang.

The receptionist looked them over critically, paying particular attention to the seal on the elder's message. "Well done. Not all newbies get it right on their first time." Stooping, she rummaged behind the counter and laid four silvers atop. "Your payment."

He stared. "Four silvers? The reward was supposed to be ten."

"It *is* ten," she said in a tone of speaking to someone slow on the uptake. "Three silvers go toward the repayment of the loan that the guild extended to you so you could buy your armor and sword."

He shook his head incredulously. "Well, what about the other three?"

"Membership and mediation fees," she said without skipping a beat.

"That's bullshit," he said, glowering at her. "I was out there risking my neck all day, and you don't even pay me my dues."

The receptionist flashed him a smile, not appearing intimidated. "Keep performing well, and you'll get access to higher tier quests and better rewards. And if you recruit a friend, both of you will get a discount on the membership fee for half a year!"

"I'm not inviting anyone, least of all a friend! This is a scam! I want out."

"Of course," she said with a note of exasperation. "You'll just have to return everything you owe us, plus interest, plus the severance fee. It all comes down to... oh, a hundred and eighty silvers."

He slammed a fist on the counter. "That's ridiculous! It would be cheaper to just buy equipment on my own and hire myself out!"

"That would be illegal as per King's Law," the receptionist said in an almost bored tone. "Unauthorized questing is punished by jail time of up to five years."

"You... you..." He growled and laid a hand on the hilt of his sword. "I won't stand for this."

The receptionist stepped back and whistled sharply. Heavy footsteps fell behind him, and a large hand squeezed his shoulder in a vice grip. Mark glanced back and swallowed when he saw the enormous barbarian who kept order in the hall looming over him.

"Is everything all right?" the barbarian thundered, giving Mark a gap-toothed sneer.

"I don't know," the receptionist drawled. "Is it, adventurer?"

Mark gritted his teeth and inclined his head. "Everything's fine," he snapped, snatching the coin off the counter. "I was just leaving."

"Be here early tomorrow," the receptionist chirped, all smiles again. "Fame and riches await."
