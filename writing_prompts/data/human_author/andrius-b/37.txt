The first recipe Sally tries on a whim. The description only says "to ward off the evil eye", and the ingredients are... odd. Rowan berries and sage and such. Somehow she finds everything she needs right in Nan's overgrown garden.

The doorbell rings as Nan's old crusty cauldron is bubbling over the stove, releasing a heady smell that is not nearly as repugnant as she would have guessed. It's a fidgety middle-aged man—a neighbor, she vaguely recalls, works in landscaping. 

"I couldn't help but notice..." He laughs nervously and drops his voice. "You're brewing, aren't you? I could never forget that smell."

"Pardon me?" Sally says, a little affronted. Whose business it is what she's doing?

"With the old lady gone, I thought that would be the end of it, but I'm glad you decided to keep the tradition," the man continues blithely. He inhales deeply and grins. "Could I bother you for a spot? My daughter's been having trouble, you see, bad luck and headaches and such."

"I have no idea what you're talking about," she says, crossing her arms.

"You don't? Ah." The man looks around and gives her a theatrical wink. "Of course not. I'll shut up now."

Despite her confused protests, he lets himself inside and finds his way to the kitchen. There he unceremoniously ladles some brew from the cauldron into a bottle and hides it in his jacket. Before Sally knows it, they're back at her doorstep, and he's shaking her hand vigorously.

"Thank you, thank you so much!"

"Er, sure," she says weakly.

Once the man has left, she opens her hand and stares at the crisp $100 bill he had slipped her. A hundred bucks? For *this*?

Huh.

She scrubs the cauldron to a gleaming sheen, and it's never empty from thereon. People keep coming, first in a trickle, then a veritable flood. Everyone's so... *normal*, regular every day folk, not at all the kind she expected to believe in this mumbo jumbo. And they all treat her with the same respect they gave her Nan.

Then a strange woman breaks in through her window. A black cat sits on her shoulder, and its blue eyes track Sally's every movement. She wears an old-fashioned long-sleeved dress and somehow looks comfortable in it.

"I hear there's a new witch in town."

It takes Sally a few moments to realize that the stranger is talking about her. "I'm not a witch," she protests hotly.

The stranger looks her over, from her herb-stained fingertips to the pocket bursting with dollar bills, and she feels heat rise to her cheeks.

"You should've told us you picked up the practice," the stranger chides. "There are ceremonies to be observed, rules to be followed."

Sally opens her mouth to protest again, but something in the stranger's eyes stops her. "I... didn't know."

The stranger looks at her for a while. "I thought as much," she finally says. "Come to the covenstead on the next full moon. We can talk to our content then."

She hands Sally a piece of paper and leaves the same way she had come—through the window, the second story one, and when Sally runs up to it to take a look, she's already nowhere in sight. 

Sally looks at the paper, which has a rough map sketched on it and a spot marked somewhere in the nearby woods, and giggles hysterically. Despite the shock of the meeting, the only thought in her head is: does she have to get a black cat now?
