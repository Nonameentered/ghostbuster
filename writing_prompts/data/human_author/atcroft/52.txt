*(Caution: Strong Language)*

-----

I sat patiently (I thought) through the council meeting, maintaining a look of severe disdain at the other non-council member present. I knew the type; they had continued to vex me across the decades since I learned to listen at my father's knee. I pulled a pouch full of lavender from my pocket and held it to my nose, breathing deeply--sometimes such measures were necessary for me to keep calm.

The longer the council members talked, the more I heard the words "fate" and "prophecy" thrown around. I realized not only had they heard from the other, they were wholeheartedly buying into this load of hogwash--but it wouldn't be their asses in the crucible. I finally reached the point where I knew I had to become involved or shut up. If I did nothing, I might still become involved--though not of my choosing.

The council members went silent when I stood, watching me warily. Sometimes a reputation has advantages.

"Members of the council," I began pausing for effect. "I am only here as a courtesy--normally I prefer people leave me alone and I happily return the favor.

"With the amount of debate you have engaged in without the stranger speaking, I take it you heard from him before the meeting. Let me guess: a string of events foretold 500, maybe 1000 years ago; the fate of the valley, the kingdom, maybe even the world in the balance; only 'The One' can stop; blah; blah; blah.

"I have heard such stories all my life--and they have never proven true. Don't tell me someone two dozen or more grandfathers ago had any idea I would be born on the day of a full moon during a thunderstorm, much less as lightning struck a tree in the town square or some such crap.

"First of all, let me say this: I am not young enough to know everything. I haven't been that young for over half my life. For fifty-odd years I have suffered under this supposed blessing of being 'The One' and that damned phrase, 'according to prophecy'. I have never believed such a thing; neither did my mother and father, although they trained me to care of myself because they knew this curse would forever be upon my neck. When some idiot thought a prophecy required a tragic backstory of 'The One', I lost my father as he defended my mother and I. I became an orphan soon after when she could not go on without him. I shed no tears when I repaid that bastard his due.

"They may have come to you, but it wasn't your life ruined, nor is it your ass that will be on the line--it's mine. I have never had a sense of normalcy. I had no friends, no loves--either people wanted to be around me only because I was 'The One', or avoided me because they did not want to be in the line of fire if it were true. Similarly I was denied any choice of occupation; when one learned who I was, they refused to take me as an apprentice for fear I may have to leave on 'my quest'. Even the monks at the monastery refused me membership for that reason.

"If I tried to learn a skill on my own, people began to question if I were preparing for said quest. Preparing for a trip on any kind of business caused the town whispers to grow louder than the chirp of a field of locusts in unison.

"I tried leaving--once. I even resorted to finding those who could pay who wanted to believe their child to be 'The One' and charging to train them for some time before disappearing into the night. I did not endanger them in doing so--I trained them well before leaving--but with the understanding 'The One' would be called when it was time, not striking out on their own seeking trouble. And no, I'm not proud of it, but you do what is required to survive.

"Whatever they asked, whatever you decide, I am not a part of it. Don't believe it, won't be party to it. And if he," I said, pointing at the silent one, "or anyone else comes to bother me about another damn fool prophecy, you'll find them pinned to the city gate next morning with my arrows."

I turned to him. "I bite my thumb at you, sir," then turned back to the council. "And if you go along with his bullshit, then I bite my thumb at you and this whole valley, too."

With that I turned and walked out of the council chambers, slamming the door behind me, not giving a damn if I saw this place again in sunshine, smoke, ash, or flame.
