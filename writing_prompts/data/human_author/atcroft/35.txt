I'm glad you enjoyed it. Thank you for taking the time to respond.

When I first posted I didn't realize the formatting was off, which I thought was what you were commenting on with the first line--until I re-read your comment. (Thanks for catching the typo, by the way!)

Regarding the line "Maybe next time I can get them to come with." I imagined the speaker having someone (either a family of their own, or even just a relationship partner) who for whatever reason didn't come with often. (It also may have been that that/those person(s) may have been part of why the speaker wasn't able to attend.)

I like your idea about reversing the two ending lines. (I was trying to do the "envelope" lines, and wasn't sure if reversing the order was allowed. I hadn't heard a term for that before.)

Thanks for assuming I was more thoughtful than I was (I appreciate the compliment). I started out thinking that was a nice turn-of-phrase, and only after I started working through it that I decided that would be a nice twist to reveal it as the setting (and thus that it might make a great envelope phrase).

Thank you for commenting. I'm glad you enjoyed it!
