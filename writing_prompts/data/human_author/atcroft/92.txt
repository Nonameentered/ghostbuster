Not familiar with the work it might be based on personally, but I did enjoy it--it was a good read.

Noticed a small issue with formatting in the last two lines--it appears the close-quote for the next-to-last line ended up on the last line. Didn't distract from the story, but thought you'd want to know.

Enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing!
