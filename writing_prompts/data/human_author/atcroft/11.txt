I'm glad you enjoyed it. It was the first "choice" that came to mind (oddly enough).

Between some old (before my time) voting systems using "levers" and references to the "levers of power", I thought it made better imagery (and not as obvious).

Your comments about the two enjambments feels right. What about the following possible edits?

For stanza 1:
> I stood there, looking   
> At the levers, unhappy   
> With my choices.   

And for stanza 4:
> Another will say we’re   
> Headed the wrong way, we’ll go   
> Backwards--the horror--oh nos.   

Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback. Glad you enjoyed.
