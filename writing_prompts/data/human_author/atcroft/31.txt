Thank you for responding. I am glad you enjoyed it!

I realized after your comments that it didn't flow quite as well as I had hoped. I think you are right--the gaps I left were a little too large to necessarily be comfortable transitions.

In my mind, the story was something like this: The pain Jim experienced was a medical event (possibly a stroke, or something similar) he experienced after the aggitation of the unexpected phone call. Dimming the lights but feeling unable to sleep he went to a familiar activity (typing the story). Finishing one or more "chapters", he sent them off in a prepared envelope for his publisher, and went back to the activity. Because of the "event", he didn't realize that what he typed (which in character counts and frequency looked like reasonable text) was jibberish which alarms his editor, prompting him to call Jim's sister Amy. What Amy found was a dishevelled Jim who was only focused on the activity (probably not having cared for himself for days), resulting in the two men having to sedate him when he fought them. We then see him waking in a room in a mental facility, seeing figures who he berates for attacking him as a result of the story. (It isn't clear if this is from the initial sedation, or further outbursts.) His sister, watching through a viewport in the door, is concerned and asked the doctor about a prognosis, who confirms that the situation is not good.

However, that was just my imagination. I suspect others may or may not fill in other details (which are equally as valid), and I enjoy seeing how the minds of others process the same details. :)

I am glad you enjoyed it. Thanks for reading!
