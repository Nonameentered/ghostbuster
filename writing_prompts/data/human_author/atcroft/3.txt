I woke up in an immaculate tailored suit, my exposed skin covered in scratches. My head was fuzzy and pounded as I tried to piece together the events of the past two days.

It was chance -- serendipity even -- that led me to run into Peter that afternoon. Twenty plus years since we had been college roommates had been as kind to him as not to me. We didn’t even recognize each other as we collided, until I said, “Sorry.”

His head snapped ‘round toward me. “John? That you?”

“Peter?” I said in shock.

“How’ve you been?” he asked. His genuine concern increased my embarrassment; my shabby, threadbare coat and worn and torn trousers were a sharp contrast to his crisp suit. I felt a pang of jealousy at the success and confidence he exuded.

We stood there, talking for a few minutes as great jets of humanity rolled past us.

“Look, I have to go, but do me a favor?” he said finally.

I raised an eyebrow. What could I do for *him*?

He wrote on the back of a card then handed it to me. “I remember how you liked a good party. Go here, tell them I sent you, then tomorrow evening call this number and be my guest.”

“Sure,” I shrugged.

“Good! You won’t be disappointed, John!” he said, slapping my shoulder before he disappeared into the crowd.

The next day, with no job prospects I made my way to the tucked away shop he had written on the back of the card. I was surprised when at the mention of Peter’s name the entire store staff dropped everything, surrounding me in a tornado of activity. Measurements, questions -- before I knew it I looked like a million dollars. I tried to explain I couldn’t afford -- but was cut off, my money was no good here. Sheepishly I asked to borrow a phone, calling the number Peter gave me before thanking them for everything.

I was surprised when a black limousine pulled up at the shop for me; I was stunned when it pulled in front of a large multi-story mansion on the outskirts of the city as sunset faded to twilight. Peter met me as I stepped out.

“Like the suit?”

“I really can’t --”

“I am always satisfied with the best,” he replied. “And besides, if it weren’t for you I wouldn’t have survived our first year. I never thanked you properly.”

“We got each other through that, Peter. Unfortunately my career since then has been ... desultory at best.”

“Here,” he said, handing me a volto mask. “Only three rules tonight: Masks on inside; what happens here stays here; and ‘No means NO’. Beyond that, my home is your home.” I started to step inside when he stopped me with an arm across my chest, “Seriously -- mask up.”

“Yes sir,” I replied in mock seriousness, slipping the mask over my eyes before stepping inside.

The scene was striking. Bougies on golden candlesticks lit each room. Everyone -- including waitstaff -- was masked. I was drawn to the staircase overlooking bay windows; men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars. A full flute appeared in my hand, and always seemed full in spite of how quickly I quaffed it down. As the evening wore on, alcohol and the flickering flames gave the walls themselves the illusory sense of being alive.

Curiosity got the better of me, and I followed a couple up the stairs. They slipped into a room before I could peek inside. As I wandered the hallway I could hear muffled sounds behind closed doors. I was drawn to the door at the end -- the master suite.

Slowly my hand grasped the knob and turned. I slipped inside, my eyes adjusting to the glow of the room’s single candle. Before me was a writhing mass of humanity -- arms, legs, faces. Whimpers turned to moans. A mouth and claws seemed to reach from the pile. As I scrambled backward, my legs went from under me, and my world faded to black.
