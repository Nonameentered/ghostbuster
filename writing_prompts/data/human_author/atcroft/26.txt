This was an interesting story. Thank you for posting.

I loved the journey you lead us on.

I'm not sure if sadness, surprise, or relief would be on the brother's face at the end--I could see reasons for any of the three. The MC mentions not finding emotions for his brother but a sentence before feels regret--may just be the way I read it.

You weaved quite the tapestry. Thank you for sharing.
