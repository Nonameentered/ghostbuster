Thank you for commenting--I'm glad you enjoyed it!

I was hoping to make it would "feel" "real" to the reader. Glad you liked that aspect.

I see what you mean about the fourth stanza--I think it stayed untouched in spite of other edits. Not sure how to make it fit the rhythms of the others (especially the other (3n+1)-th stanzas), but something to consider.

I appeciate the feedback. Thank you!

Do you think changing this:

> I stood in abject terror--  
> Hoping to be floor-swallowed,  
> Wishing for a mass mind-wipe.  

To something like this:

> In abject terror--  
> Floor-swallow me.   
> Please?  

Would work?
