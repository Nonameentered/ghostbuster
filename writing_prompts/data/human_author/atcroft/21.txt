Sheriff Bob Dorn killed his headlights as he pulled up beside his deputy’s car. Killing the engine and stepping out onto the Johnson’s front yard, he surveyed the scene. Through the light rain dots of light bobbed outward to the north, south, and west, occasionally occluded by volunteer searchers. “Got here as quick as I could, Joe.”

“Sorry to disturb your vacation; I know it’s been a while since you took any time for you and the family--” Deputy Joe Barnes said apologetically.

Sheriff Dorn shook his head. “We were on a charter when the message come through. I had something on the hook, but when we got the message I looked at Bonnie and she cut the line before I could ask the captain to head back to port. So what’s the situation?”

A sudden gust of wind made Barnes scramble to secure the topographical map spread across his hood. Dorn reached down, picking up several rocks to act as holders for the map. 

“The storm rolled in around 13:00 this afternoon,” Barnes retold. “Mrs. Roberts said a little before that Bounder and 6-year-old Jimmy were on the front porch, but when the first crack of thunder shook the house she ran to the door but they were nowhere to be seen. She tried to look for them when the hail started. Hell, Bob, she didn’t even make it to the mailbox--”

“Andrea okay?”

“Physically--you see my windshield? And she was in the open. She’s got whelps that look like she got caught in front of a pitching machine, but the EMTs said she’s damned lucky not to have a concussion to boot. She’s trying hard to hold it together, but I’ve known her since high school and I’ve never seen her like this.

“The storm only lasted ten, fifteen minutes. Had limbs and lines down everywhere, even busted out a couple of the house windows, too. Phones are still out, even at the station.

“The Smithfields are the nearest neighbors, but they’re a half-mile toward town. She hobbled up to their place and asked Ray and Sandy if he could run into town to get help; Sandy tried to have her stay but she said she had to get back to looking for Jimmy. 

“Roads were a mess; Ray had to clear trees as he went, so it was almost an hour and a half after the storm before he reached the station. Bonnie in Dispatch commandeered the high school cross-country team to run messages. In spite of the damage by 16:00 we had two dozen volunteers here ready to help, and more have been coming out as they can ever since.

“I started them on a grid search. We’ve got folks going north, west, and south from here--”
 
“Why not east as well, Joe?”

Deputy Barnes cocked his head at Bob. “You serious?”

“I’m waiting--”

“The only thing to the east of here is the old Pleasence place, and none of the kids around here are stupid enough to go there.”

“What does that mean? I’ve been here five years and never heard about this ‘Pleasence place’.”

“It’s the last place at the end of this road; this place butts up against it. No one remembers when it started, but supposedly ol’ man Pleasence had quite the career as an actor in his younger years. Story goes that before the end he started confusing reality and his most notable role in some horror flick. That was just the start, though; since then it’s been ground-zero for all kinds of weird happenings and disappearances. I tell you that place is cursed. No one goes there.”

“Joe, that’s the biggest load of hogwash I’ve heard in years.”

“Who cares if it is true or not? No one cares to chance it.”

“Joe, a kid might not--unless his dog does and is in trouble. And I don’t care if the place was a burial ground cheated from under a tribe by the Voorhees and defiled by an orgy hosted by the Krugers and the Myers, it’s cover so get your ass over there and check it.”

Barnes swallowed hard, setting his jaw as he walked toward the dilapidated house at the end of the road like a man to his execution. A light fog rose from the broken pavement. The lights shrunk to a point as he reached the house. He walked around it, looking for a way inside before stepping tentatively onto the old porch, unsure it would support him. His flashlight barely penetrated the dirt-covered windows as he tried to peer inside. The door howled in protest as he forced it with his shoulder.

Minutes later Barnes’ distant screams raised the hairs on Sheriff Dorn’s neck. “Sheriff! Sheriff! Come here! You need to see this!”
