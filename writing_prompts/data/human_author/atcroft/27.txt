Interesting tale. I didn't realize where it was going until it started going dark and--wow.

One minor nit. When I read this line:
> But that was long before they stole him from me.

I thought maybe you meant "long **after** they stole him". (I could be wrong, however.)

I could see two possibities: either she is in therapy (trying to cope), or that her mental state is being evaluated for trial, (I leaned toward the former.) Loved how she describes "splitting" herself in order to do this, although I half-expected the "other" her to come out as a result. (Also love it when an author subverts my expectations--it's fun to see where they go!)

Great read. Thanks for submitting.
