I had similar concerns.

The idea is that each set of three (3) paragraphs form the pattern: the first is the thoughts, the second the physical reaction, the third "why" the reaction. The first "triplet" is his saying "hi", the second is her reply, the third is her reacting favorably.

May play with it again later. Thanks for giving me something to think about!
