Coated in sweat, the cool air from the window made both Winston and Julia shiver. It was proof of their shame. They huddled together, pulling the tattered blanket up around them as the song of the red-armed washing woman echoed through the window. They savored the afterglow of their recent activity, Julia's head resting on Winston's shoulder. The feel of her skin against him was electric, alive--the most alive he could remember feeling. He ran his fingers through her hair without thinking.

"How do you do it?" he asked, not expecting an answer.

"I thought I just showed you," she said, pushing herself up onto her elbows to slap his arm playfully then dropping onto her stomach.

"I mean how do you keep the thoughts from playing across your features, giving away that you know? I still feel someone will see when I slip."

"You have to be a bit of a liar," she replied. "You have to be able to lie to yourself--repeat their lies enough that a small part of you just starts to believe, and let that part control your features, while keeping the larger part--the part that knows better--beneath the surface." As the washing woman began another song, Julia added, "And sometimes that means you have to hold it down, hold it down hard, like her washing that needs to soak."

Julia shifted again, the blanket sliding down to her waist as she turned on her side. He looked again to the book--a collection of heresies and mystery. Within its pages lay their death warrants if they were found with it. He reached for it, his fingers brushing its cover before he picked it up, the well-worn spine opening easily to the beginning.

As he sat up against the bedstead, Julia smiled sleepily at him.

"We must read it," Winston said.

"You read it," Julia replied, her eyes shut. "Read it aloud to me. That's the best way. Then you can explain it to me."
