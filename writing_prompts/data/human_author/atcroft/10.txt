Catherine closed the door silently--hoping she wasn’t heard, wishing it had locks--and raced to the window. She clawed at the latch, desperately trying to pry it open. It refused--out of disuse, collected dust, frequent repaintings. A creak on the stairs made her start, turning her head quickly to the door before redoubling her efforts on the window. Even if she opened it, it was a long way down. Quickly she considered the odds--could she break out the window and survive a third-floor jump well enough to escape?

The footsteps grew louder then stopped, the door knob slowly turning. The door swung open, a masked, coverall-clad figure starting in. 

She spun quickly, her back pressed to the window. Her choices were limited--break the window, jump and get hurt; or be killed by a mask-wearing psycho. 

The masked figure stopped mid-step. 

She imagined they seemed to catch their breath. Her eyes flickered around the room looking for anything of use before settling back on her pursuer. She could feel their eyes inching up and down over the remaining shreds of her floral nightie, goosebumps rising on her bare legs, her blood running cold. *Anything she could use...*

“See anything you like?” she said with more confidence than she had in the moment.

The figure tried to speak, their words jargogled, finally sputtering, “Y-y-yu-uh yeah.”

Catherine stared. *That voice! Who--?*

The figure raised a hand, sliding their mask off.

“William--? What kind of sick joke is this? Close the door, there’s a psycho out there.” she said in hushed tones, racing around the bed to hug him.

William’s mind was still replaying the silhouette of Catherine through diaphanous cloth against moonlight as she jumped into his arms.

“I’m glad it’s you,” she said, kissing his cheek in excitement, his face turning crimson in the moonlight. 

He hugged her tightly, “There, there,” he whispered. She felt so warm in his arms.

“The phone’s out. I went to the bathrooms--found Courtney there dead. Back at the cabin Leslie was bleeding out just inside the door.”

He could feel her breathing slow as he rocked her gently. “You’re safe now.”

“I heard snapping limbs, ran--ran through the woods. Lost shoes, snagged gown, limbs scratching, clawing--”

“Nothing to worry about now, Catherine.”

“Went up to-to Mrs. Angel’s room. She was--” Catherine started to sob, but caught herself.

He stroked her back lightly. “I’ll protect you.”

“I raced to the girls’ room. Jill, Diana, and Megan--all dead in their room.”

William moved one hand, stroking her hair calmingly. “I won’t let them hurt you again,” he said softly, holding  her tighter.

“I heard footsteps on the lower stairway--raced upstairs, thinking I’d be next.” she said, burying her head in his shoulder.

He slowly patted her back. He felt her stiffen and pull back slightly.

She pulled back, looking into his eyes, “Wait, ‘they’? There’s only one psycho out there.”

“We all go a little mad sometimes,” he said sheepishly.

Her eyes hardened. “What are you saying, William?”

“I-I-I love you.” he stammered, almost more question that statement. “I saw how the girls have treated you since kindergarten, I saw how they mistreated you when we got here. I saw--I saw how they hazed you in the woods that night--”

A look of horror started across Catherine’s face, realizing he knew.

“You’re smart. You’re pretty. You’re kind to everyone--even me.” He looked away. “You didn’t deserve--that. How could you stay after they--”

“What did you do, William?”

“You’re too nice to them, Catherine. Even after all that--”

“I was just going to scare them--”

“I’m safe? Nothing to worry about? Because I’m here with you?!? You love me?!? Your truths are worse than your lies.”

“Catherine, I f’ed up. I was just going to scare them--teach ‘em a lesson--maybe even work up the nerve to say more than five words to you when we get back to school.”

Her eyes softened.

She ran her fingers through his hair. “You’ve already said a hundred and a quarter or more of them.”

“I didn’t know you’d be so easy to talk to. I--I didn’t mean for it to get so--”

She put a finger to his lips. “Shhh--we have a few hours to get things ready before a girl and her boyfriend--the only two survivors of a psycho spree--stumble into town with news after hiding in the woods all night.”

“B-b-boyfriend--?” he stuttered.

“Who else would go to such lengths for his girl? But that’s between us.” She eyed him carefully. “We will have to put you in less, though--” she said, running a finger down his chest, “--make it seem we survived because we snuck away from camp together. We have to make sure our stories are straight. But right now you need practice kissing--”
