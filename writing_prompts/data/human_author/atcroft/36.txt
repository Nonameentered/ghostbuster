Thank you for your comments. I am glad you enjoyed it.

The phrase that had you confused was the speaker saying they were sorry they missed the funeral, but also that they didn't visit more frequently before. (I imagined it said with more than a hint of regret.)

As to how to make it more "poem-y", I appreciate the advice. (Like you, I'm not that comfortable in the poetic space, leaning more toward "free-ish verse" and poetic imagery rather than formal rhyme schemes, etc.)

I'm glad you enjoyed it, and for the comments. Thank you!
