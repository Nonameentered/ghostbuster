Questions regarding mystery writing:
1. Are there major subtypes of mysteries? If so, what are they? (The types of mysteries that come to my mind are the classic noir-style stories, the criminal procedural (or the related version where the lawyer or their team  solves the mystery), and the various amateur-sleuth stories. But are there others?)
2. If there are other subtypes, is there much appetite for them?
3. How do you approach them? Any special considerations?
