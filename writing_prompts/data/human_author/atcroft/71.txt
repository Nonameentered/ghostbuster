Thank you for the comments.

I didn't want to rehash a familiar fairy tale, and I had trouble finding a definition of "fairy tale" that everyone agreed to. I started with the idea of trying to reverse a fairy tale, bringing them into this universe but gave up trying to work that out. Thinking of a difference in the flow of time between this universe and that one made me think of the trope of someone going out to run an errand and never being seen again... and thus the story above.

(And even comments about what you did or did not like prove useful, giving me an idea of what did or did not work.)
