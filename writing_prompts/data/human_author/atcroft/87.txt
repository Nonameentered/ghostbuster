*(Fictionalized imagining of the agreement between Charles Goodnight and John George Adair to form the JA Ranch, 1876. )*

It was a time of innovation.

The world was shrinking. Samuel Clements had taken the pen name he would make famous, and published a travelogue of twenty thousand miles in five months; three years later Mr. Verne published a novel making a trip over half again its length in under 80 days.

It was a time of empire.

Clashes were inevitable. In the Old World there was no effort to conserve life. Men forced to absquatulate for a distant front, with barely enough time to kiss their sweethearts goodbye before becoming feed for the latest meat grinder.

In the Texas Panhandle empires of another sort were growing. Two men sat on a porch in rocking chairs, sharing a drink in the moonlight.

"So we doin' this, John?"

"Aye, we aare, Charles."

Charles lifted a glass in salute, first toward his partner, then to toward the night beyond. "To the JA."

"Guid forder," his partner replied before they finished their glasses.
