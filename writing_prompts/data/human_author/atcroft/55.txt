Thank you for sharing the comments. I'm glad you enjoyed the piece.

I always take comments with at least a pinch of salt, but since poetry is not my normal wheelhouse I'm happy for any and all advice/suggestions/etc. I occasionally catch myself repeating the same words/phrases, so definitely something for me to try to watch for going forward.
