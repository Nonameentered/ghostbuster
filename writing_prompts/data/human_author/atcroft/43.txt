I turned my head and there she was, an angel in her light, billowy sundress, her smile bright even from a distance. I leapt from the felt-covered folding chair, running from the shade between the stones of the verdant field. She had changed so much since I saw her last--became the beautiful vibrant woman the childhood me could never have looked in the eye without blushing--and yet was the same in every way that mattered.

----

That last day together came back to me in stark relief--a hot summer day, two kids dressed identically swinging their feet over the edge of the pond, the only difference the firey red hair spilling from under one's baseball cap.

I had never known a time not knowing her. We were two peas of a pod; inseparable. We were still children, knew nothing about the world coming at us by the second, the changes that could make or shatter dreams. 

I lay back on the pier, closing my eyes. It grew darker; I opened my eyes to find myself staring up into her eyes. She sat down on my waist, pinning me, laying forward, becoming my blanket; I could feel the warmth of her breath upon my cheek. Goosebumps rose on my arms; my ears felt hot.

She kissed my cheek. "I think I love you, Jimmy," she whispered. "I mean--I think this is what they mean by 'love'."

My cheeks were aflame; my mouth went dry. All I could think to do was wrap her in a hug, which felt so right. We could have stayed like that forever. I had no words for what I felt then; the words escape me still.

We heard her mom calling for her. She jumped and ran for home. It happened so fast I never got to reply, never got to say good-bye.

----

She jumped into my embrace; we spun round and round in joy. She felt perfect in my arms, as if she had always been there and never left. I lowered her against me to her feet, a schoolboy grin across my face. But she could see it, storm clouds rolling behind my eyes. She could read me so well, read the thoughts about to bubble up before I knew them.

"What's wrong?"

I pressed my face to her shoulder, crying on the soft cotton. "I don't know how to do it alone. You were deliberate and afraid of nothing; I was only brave when I was with you. When you left, I lost my way. And there was so much I didn't say--didn't know how to say--still don't know how to say."

She stroked my hair, squeezing me close. "You didn't have to; I could read them in your actions." She whispered softly in my ear, "You will do great things. Don't accept the world as it is. Remember, I'm right here, and I believe in you." Her soft lips placed a gentle kiss on my cheek, her breath warm upon my ear.

----

A hand touched my arm, returning me from the reverie of meeting to the hot, stifling numbness of the day. My heart broke--it was all illusory.

Mechanically I got up and trudged forward, crumbling a handful of dirt over the casket, taking one last look at her picture before turning to walk away in the guilt and shame of things unsaid.
