Wow! I liked it. (And I'm impressed that you got a table to even work!)

It was interesting I could read it in three different ways--line-by-line reading down, left-side only, or right-side only. 

I only had three (3) questions:
1. Were the four lines outside meant to be part of it as well? (With the final table of arrows, I thought maybe something happened with the formatting and it was supposed to be part.
2. Were the rows of arrows meant to indicate the reader had a choice of which side they read from that point forward? (If so, that made many more paths through the poem than I originally considered. Impressive!)
3. The last four rows in table 1 are the same two lines ("We're once again on clear-cut path / Simple footpath now we'll trace.") I was curious why you didn't either a) line them up, or b) make them span the columns. (Although I could see where technical/formatting limitations might've prevented option "b".)

Well done! Thanks for sharing.
