College professor's office with numerous awards on the walls. A large window overlooks the college "quad" on  a late afternoon in early Spring.

  *Professor Richard Pierson is removing the awards from the walls, placing them in boxes. He pauses to carefully run his fingers over his old notebook, remembering the events of a previous October.*

PIERSON

  *Thinking aloud, getting madder as he does so.*

Of all the indignities--after years of distinguished service as a professor here at Princeton, to be told I must take a sabbatical because some students believe I have become a senile old man who feels he must embellish. Like so many they don't want to remember the events of those two weeks in October so long ago.

  *The Professor takes his old notebook from atop a box, remembering the events of a previous October as he runs his fingers over its cover.*

PIERSON

Yes, they twist and turn their minds like gymnasts to explain what is in front of them: the traces of black powder that can still be seen on damaged buildings, the wasted fields slowly starting to heal. They refuse to even consider a visit the museum where the dissembled parts of a Martian machine are kept on view, instead calling it a hoax."See to everything yourself," I challenged them, "if you don't believe--the evidence is all around you." But they refuse to believe. 

  *Pierson swings his hand broadly as if encompassing the far wall.*

PIERSON

They cannot conceive anything more powerful than the gun, or life anywhere but this globe. Aging is not lost youth, it is the loss of preconceived notions, allowing one's mind to consider evidence openly not prematurely discarding what does not fit their dogma.

  *Pierson lowers his voice, putting the last award from the wall in the box before setting the notebook carefully atop it and picking up the box to leave.*

PIERSON

Perhaps I've failed them, those who would dismiss those experiences rather than be challenged by them. I once thought it was a reprieve--for the Martians, not us--but now I'm not so sure. Maybe the time away will do me some good. Perhaps I'll even have the opportunity to ring that gentleman who keeps writing me... Oh, what was his name? Fells? Wheels? No, Wells, I think it was. Something about a book of his, I believe.

  *Pierson leaves, lights fade to black.*
