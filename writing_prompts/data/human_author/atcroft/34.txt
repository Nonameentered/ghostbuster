I enjoyed your piece. The emotions are palpable.

I'm not good at critiquing (much less poetry), so I'll be brief. Line 3 ("You look a bit different then before") I think you meant "than before" (speech to text error?). I had to re-read it to understand--the speaker is talking to a dandelion they believe to be the person that passed, correct? Line 12 ("Itâ€™s warm and comforting, I cry a disgrace"), did you mean "cry in disgrace"?

You did a great job conveying the sadness of the speaker and their sense of loss.

Well done.
