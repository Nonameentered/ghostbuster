I went back and changed the following lines (for anyone playing along):

Original:

> “I-I-I love you.” he stammered, almost more question that statement.
> 
> “What do you mean?”
> 
> “I saw how the girls have treated you since kindergarten, I saw how they mistreated you when we got here. I saw--I saw how they hazed you in the woods that night--”
> 
> A look of horror started across Catherine’s face.
> 
> “You’re smart. You’re pretty. You’re kind to everyone--even me.” He looked away. “You didn’t deserve--that. How could you stay after they--”
> 
> “What did you do, William?”
> 
> “You’re too nice to them, Cat. Even after all that--”
> 
> “What did you do?!?”
> 
> “I was just going to scare them--”
> 
> “I’m safe? Nothing to worry about? Because I’m here with you?!? You love me?!? Your truths are worse than your lies.”
> 
> “Catherine, I f’ed up. I was just going to scare them--teach ‘em a lesson--maybe even work up the nerve to say more than five words to you when we get back to school.”
> 
> She ran her fingers through his hair. “You’ve already said a hundred and a quarter or more of them.”
