Thank you for responding. I'm glad you found it interesting.

The two "anchor" sentences seemed **very** different. My (partial) first draft was a grandpa telling what would have been his  cold winter's spy story to his grandson, but I found it getting  unwieldy. When I came back to it, the idea of a veteran returning to the battlefield (and the contrast between the healed appearance of the site and their experience) popped into my head. Trying to come up with a way to tie that to the ending led to encountering the preparations for the parade (I thought it might be related to the very same conflict) and their thought that it should be a day of rememberance--which gave me the "out" of turning away from the lights to go home.

I can definitely see what you're saying about weaving the parade in; I'm just not sure I would be the best one to write it.

Glad you liked it. Thanks for the feedback.
