He stood at his post, looking out over sooth waters as dark as ink. He adjusted the golden guanin that hung from his neck--its weight a reminder of the responsibility as cacique for the safety of his yucayeque. His hand went to his nearby macana in the darkness. It had been his father's. His father--it had been not three moons before that his father had been killed in battle defending Guanahani from the raiders that came from the sea, and his mother had selected him the next cacique. His other hand went to the scar across his stomach, yet another reminder of that night and the dangers. 

He heard the creak of the ladder to his side to see the glow of a flame climbing up to meet him. He looked at the face on the glow's other side, imagining the day of the next moon when she would begin to wear his apron. He smiled as she handed him the bitter fruits he could chew to stay awake until the dawn, his mind following as she took the flame back down the ladder.

As the moon broke the horizon he thought his eyes deceiving him. He imagined he saw something on the distant horizon, unlike anything he had seen. A ship perhaps, bigger than the largest canoes on Guanahani, with spindly trees standing atop it. It must be a dream, or perhaps a vision from the zemi. He shook himself to ensure he was awake. Squinting, he could not tell if he saw one, three, or none at all.

As the morning sky began to lighten, he smiled. The view was breathtaking. The sky would slowly turn indigo, lightening to blue gradually as the sun rose on clear blue waters. As the sun left the horizon for its run across the sky, from his post he saw three of the strange boats from the night--much closer this time. Smaller canoes approached the shoreline, filled with strangely-dressed, odd-looking people in shiny, colorful clothing. He watched as one dressed in flaming red jumped from the boat, splashing through the light surf to drive a staff in the sand, a cloth flowing outward from its top in the breeze. He took his macana in his hand and began the climb down the ladder. He would meet them on the beach, to learn if they were friend or foe.

Several of his warriors stood in the treeline, watching the strangers from behind trees. He walked toward the large bearded one in the reds of sunrise, making the signs of greeting of his people. Several of the strangers pointed odd sticks at him, but when the bearded one held up a hand they relaxed, putting the sticks on their shoulders.

"Hayukya," he said, pointing to himself.

Several of the strangers looked on in confusion, but the bearded one nodded. "Ko-lam-bus," he said, replicating the gesture.

Hayukya pointed to one of his people in the treeline who came forward with a bundle of fruit, and pointed to the bearded man. She placed the fruit at his feet, then backed away, returning to the treeline.

The bearded man whistled and a youth brought forth an object, laying it at Hayukya's feet and backed up to the bearded man. Hayukya lifted it, curious. It was a large, flat bowl, not wood but heavy and hard like rock, but smooth and colorful. Hayukya smiled at the bearded man. He could feel both groups begin to relax, and the bearded man approached. In that moment, Hayukya knew only one fact: Life would never be the same.
