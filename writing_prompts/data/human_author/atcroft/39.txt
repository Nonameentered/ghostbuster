The senses--windows from the soul,  
Filters on the world, elements of control.  
Each one a portal, a filter applied.  
A summer's day--let's step outside,  

The wind to your face a torch,  
Hot, dry, guaranteed to scorch.  
Sunlight beating down, shade no relief.  
You try to keep your time there brief.  

Close your eyes, open your mouth,  
Tongue in, or maybe out,  
Gritty, the taste of dirt  
It's not subtle--rather overt.  

The smells--roasted grass, baking cement,  
A running motor, melting pavement,  
Linger languid in the air  
They too dying to be elsewhere.  

Silence--deafeningly loud,  
Any sound seemingly bowed,  
No birds singing, no one working  
If they are, the heat they're cursing.  

Open your eyes, sensory overload  
Burning eyes, everything glowed.  
Heat makes everything move and shimmer  
You wish you could find the dimmer.  

Seeking for shadow, seeking for shade,  
Seeking coolness however it's made,  
A sprinkle of water, a hint of a breeze,  
A hit of escape however you please.  

The senses--filters applied  
To the world around, no relief supplied.  
Against a summer's day? You tell me  
How different it is between me and thee.
