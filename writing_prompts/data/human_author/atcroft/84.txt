Wow-I quite enjoyed your work on this. 

You pulled me into the world (a good thing), and made me want to read faster to see what would happen next.

I did notice two places where there were repeated words and one place where it appeared the wrong word was used (I'm guessing possibly the result of auto-correct or speech-to-text (StT)?), but it was not enough to eject me from the story.

I quite appreciate the research rabbit hole, having swirled around that drain more than a time or two myself (and at least once crossed its event horizon).

Again, I quite enjoyed this. Well done!
