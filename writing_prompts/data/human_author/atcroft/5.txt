She drifted like a mist through her library to the window, settling light as a fog on the chair. She found it easier this way--it was amazing how many books one could fit into a room, assuming one didn’t want to move around very much. She drank deep from her cup of stars, fusing with the quiet night awaiting the first rays of morning.

As black faded to purple, movement caught her still eagle eye--a rider, full armor, banner unfurled, at speed.

*That’s never a good sign,* she thought, shaking her head slowly. Her experiences with knights were--unpleasant for both sides--she’d hoped she’d turned the page on that. Still, she needed to be ready, so she flicked her wrist his direction, fog rolling into the valley to give her time to prepare.

The sun was almost overhead when a glove of metal beat upon the solid wood door. Wildlife scattered at the sudden sound. “Inhabitant!” the glove’s owner bellowed, “I seek audience wi--”

“Shhh--you’re scaring the animals, whippersnapper!” she hissed out a small window from shadow. A wave of her hand opened the door downstairs. “Enter. You’ll be led to me. And watch that damned sword--too easy to bump something that’s already cattywampus and make me have to clean for days after you leave.”

He stepped inside to find a cat on the stair cleaning its paw. It looked him over before resigning to lead the knight upward.

She slid her hands before her, smoothing the lines of age and tatters of cloth into the dark and imposing dress of her youth. As the cat entered, only her eyes smiled. “Thank you, Gon,” she said firmly, eyeing the knight. The cat turned, ignoring the knight as it left the room tail high. “State your business, knight.”

The knight turned to look around the cramped library, his scabbard knocking over a stack of books.

“Dammit!” she said, flicking fingers around toward her, his sword and scabbard flying to her. She caught it, laying it carefully to one side. “Now--sit!” she said, sliding her fingers across, a chair following her action to scoop him up. She looked at the scattered books and papers from the stack. “If you damaged my notes, so help me--”

His teeth chattered, and it was not his armor that made him sweat. “Pardon, Miss. I am on an urgent matter. I seek Maleficent, Mistress--”

“Just call me Mal--the full version brings back too many bad memories for too many. What is this matter?”

“I was sent by Queen Aurora--” At the mention of that name, she felt her hand clench. “She sent me to appeal for your help.”

“My help? She had three fairy godmothers--why would she need MY help?” her amarulence was palpable.

“Her granddaughter, Talia, has come down with a dread disease. She’s broody, moody, and occasionally bursts into song. And...” Suddenly he stood, arm outstretched, “There once was a man from Nantucket, who wore on his head a bucket. He swung at a nail, but found his thumb, and with a roar yelled, 'Aww, f--'” He slapped a hand across his mouth, collapsing back into the chair, dejected. “...it’s contagious.”

She covered her mouth, stifling a giggle. “How long?”

“I was sent a month ago. It should’ve been one, two weeks’ journey, but in the woods I kept having uncontrollable outbreaks of dancing with animals...”

“Do you know what she was doing when this began?”

“She found an old sewing basket of the Queen’s. Was teaching herself to sew when she pricked her finger with a needle.”

Mal leaned toward the knight. “Tell me, do you know what she was sewing when she did?”

“Old, rough cloth--maybe someone’s first attempt.” he saw her expression change. “That mean something to you?”

She looked around, picking up one or two old books, blowing the dust from their covers.

“I’m to bring back a cure, or you--dead or alive--An’ I walk these streets, loaded six-string on my back, I play for keeps, ‘cause I might not make it ba--” Clamping his hand on his mouth, his face was ashen. “I don’t even know what those words mean. What’s a ‘Nantucket’?”

“Then we better hurry. We’ll take my wagon--your horse can walk alongside--that way we can keep moving, avoid animal dance mobs.”

“The Queen did say to tell you--if you could help Talia, she would consider your slate clean.”

She called several other books to her, and glided him, his sword, her, and her books out the door and down the stairs. “Gon, Koma, you’re in charge. I’ll be back in a month.”

“Right, Mistress,” Gon replied, the door closing behind her. 

The knight looked at her in disbelief.

“You’re surprised?” she said as they settled onto the readied wagon and started on their way.
