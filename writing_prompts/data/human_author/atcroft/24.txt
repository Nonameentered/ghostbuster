If it helps any, here is how I parsed it.

> “Where are you?”
> “I’m hiding in the tall grass at Pierpoint Lake. It’s cold. Dark. Goosebumps all over.”

Place in question is "Pierpoint Lake".

> “Is he there with you?”
> “No. He’s dead. Murdered in January.”
> “This isn’t where it happened though, correct?”

I read "[t]his [was]n't where it happened" as referring to where her son was "[m]urdered in January".

> “No. Was in the street in front of our home. Where he learned to ride a bike, played soccer with his friends. But that was long before they stole him from me. Tainted his mind.”

I can see your point.

In my initial reading, I read "[w]as in the street in front of our home" was where the murder occurred, and "[b]ut that was" as referring to when he was murdered.

On re-reading, I can see how it can also be read as saying "[b]ut that was" referring to when he learned to ride a bike or when he played soccer. I think it is the way the lines were divided. Perhaps  saying, "...with his friends, but that was..." instead might make it clearer...?

Either way, I think it was a good story. Well done!
