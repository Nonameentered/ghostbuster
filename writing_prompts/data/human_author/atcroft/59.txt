Nicely done!

I originally thought about saying the doctor was feline or canine, but decided it was easier to say "not human". Your story is great evidence that choice was a better one.

Your MC feels real, and not only can I imagine their reactions but feel I would likely have the same in their place. The final line has several nice touches; not only the patient's name but the doctor's comment feels like a Freudian slip.

Well done! Thanks for your reponse.
