"This interview is being recorded as interview number 20220529-2118, agents Michael Morrison--myself--and George Marion conducting. Will you state your name for the record, please?"

"John Michael Ethan Patrick Kirkpatrick."

"Lord have mercy--"

"George, please."

"Did your parents hate you, Mr. Kirkpatrick?"

"George Marion, I thought I taught you better interview manners than that."

"Geez, Michael. I mean--to give someone that many names. I know I only have two names, and when I was growing up if I heard both of them I knew I was in trouble. I was curious how many names he had to hear to know he was in it deep. Did two names mean trouble? Three? More before it was on?"

"Shut up, George. This is just wasting Mr. Kirkpatrick's time. I'm sorry, Mr. Kirkpatrick, my partner here--"

"Call me 'Duke'."

"'Duke'?"

"George, please..."

"Yeah, my mom was a big John Wayne fan, so when they named me they mixed together his first name and the first names of his sons. And actually it was more like the Fujita scale for tornadoes... I had to count how many names were used, to know how much trouble was about to hit my ass. And damn but she can still lift me off the ground with that damn paddle of hers."

"Know what you mean, Duke, my mom's the same way. Don't know how she can be that small and still swing it that hard."

"I know, right?"

"Gentlemen, we are far off topic here. Now please, 'Duke', can you tell us what you saw on the night of the 23rd?"

"Well, Mr. Morrison, I had just gotten out of my appointment--"

"'Appointment', Duke?"

"Yes, Mr. Marion. I had a case of megalomania starting on Friday afternoon--but I'm better now. Monday morning I called and got the last appointment that day--"

"Who's your doc?"

"George..."

"Dammit Michael, the man got an appointment with his doctor *the same day*. Hell, I can't even get an appointment earlier than 8 weeks out, so I'm just wondering if he can hook me up."

"Anyway, I was leaving Dr. Matamousour's office--"

"How do you spell that?"

"George, please--"

"M-a-t-a-m-o-u-s-o-u-r. His office is off of Main Street."

"In the Smith Building?"

"That's the one."

"Thanks!"

"As I was saying, I was leaving the Doc's when I ran into my friend, Sam."

"Sam?"

"Oh, Samuel Smith. Lives two doors down. So anyway the two of us decide to cut through the park to shorten the way home.

"Well, Sam and I were talking as we made our way through the park. I mentioned I wasn't able to grab lunch, so he reached in his pocket and tossed me a brownie. I wolfed it down while Sam was trying to put together an idea. It was inchoate, but Sam is tenacious when he's trying to remember something.

"Anyway, all of a sudden Sam does a pirouette and finds himself at the tip of the spear--literally. He'd always thought that was a metaphor. When you find a spear at your throat you're very much awake and listening to what the other end says, especially when there's a cloaked dude on the other end of the spear. Several more cloaked folks stepped out of the shadows and had us surrounded."

"What happened next, 'Duke'?"

"Well, Mr. Morrison, the guy with the spear at Sam's throat said something. Let me see... 'Sacrifices must be made, whether ritual or otherwise.'--I think that's what he said, at least. I was too distracted by the colors of the cloaks--they were iridescent and seemed to be changing in front of me.

"Well, the rest of them use their spears to show Sam and I the way--and believe me, a sharp spear point is quite a motivator. We end up in this clearing with torches and a bunch more in cloaks. I know Sam is still okay, but by this time I'm more interested in the torch flames--looks like angel and demon couples atop each torch in a dance contest pulling out all the stops."

"Go on, 'Duke'?"

"Well all of a sudden there was the *snap* of a branch, and everything seemed to stop, turning toward the sound. The dudes, the flames, everything. I screamed, surprising the figures around me and ran like the wind. I kept running, my heart trying to pound its way out of my chest. I don't know how or if Sam got away--I haven't seen him this week."

"Thank you, 'Duke', for your cooperation. George, can you show 'Duke' out?"

-----

"Okay, I took him downstairs. They'll take care of him. So, what do you think, Mike?"

"Drugs? Psychosis? I don't think we can use any of his testimony."

"Well, at least the doc checked out--I've got an appointment for Tuesday."
