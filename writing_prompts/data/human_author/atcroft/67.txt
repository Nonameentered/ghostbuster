Thank you. When I saw the prompt I had several ideas for approaches to a Western, but thought I'd go in a direction perhaps less traveled--inside the head of the condemmed about to swing.

I decided I didn't want a "through and through" bad guy, so I started with someone who went west with good intentions, but too late found themselves approaching the bottom of that slippery slope. (Thus the treasured memory he didn't want to tarnish.)

I took the idea of getting the gun from the movie *El Dorado*, using an "off-screen" incident as the impetus and his first step on the slope. Continuing to use ideas from *El Dorado* I made his work just that--work. Nothing personal, just a job that paid.

The incident in town was a combination of two ideas: the song *El Paso* and the movie *Big Jake*, with a hint remaining from *El Dorado*. Coming "off the trail" I decided to have him get into trouble born of misunderstanding and reflex. Jealousy of a drunken patron (*El Paso* influence) and a scene reminiscent of the older son and the two cowboys in the Mexican bar from *Big Jake* mixed with the idea of a murder (dusted with the influence of the story of the shotgun's previous owner from *El Dorado*). From there it was a few weeks for a circuit judge to make the rounds.

When I broke his reverie I decided after remembering how he got there he was going to meet his fate eyes open (allowing me to use the unanswered question(s)), and the final touch was to drop the trap as his world slowed down.

(Afterward I thought about editing to have the clothes comment foreshadow, but decided not to so I could lead the reader down the path to the ending.)

Glad you enjoyed it!
