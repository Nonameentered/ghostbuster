It was a wrong number that started it, the telephone ringing three times in the dead of night, and the voice on the other end asking for someone he was not.

Jim Stevens had stumbled out of a deep sleep to get the phone, bouncing off every door frame between the bedroom and the phone.

“Who? Columbia? What--there’s no Columbia here... Do you even know what time of night it is is here? Goodbye!” he almost yelled into the receiver before dropping it in its cradle.

Everything can change at any moment, suddenly and forever.

A sharp pain stabbed at his eyes. He pressed his hands to their sockets, their warmth giving him a brief respite. He shook it off, turning down the lights, and sat down at his typewriter. *Might as well try to write a little, since I’m up now,* he thought wearily.

As the sun peered through the blinds, he slid the stack of pages into the manila envelope, pressing the seal shut before taking them out to the post for his publisher.

Paul sat in his office, trying to make sense of the package he received. Nice, neatly formatted, every submission requirement followed to the letter--a perfect manuscript. But two pages--mid-sentence--discernible words disappeared. From a distance, it looked like normal typed pages, but up close the letters were wrong--like someone replaced all the typewriter keys with the wrong letters.

Paul pressed the intercom button. “Jill?”

“Yes, Mr. Rossman?”

“Can you look up the number for Mr. Stevens’ sister, then put me through to her? It’s urgent.”

“Right away, Mr. Rossman.”

He sighed, rubbing the back of his neck as he stared at the stack of gibberish before him.

Jim was frantically typing--he hadn’t had this kind of writing streak in years. He didn’t hear the knock at the door over the clack of the typewriter, nor did he hear the click of the lock, nor was he aware of the two men who walked over to him until they took him by his arms.

“Wha-?!? Who are you? Unhand me, damnit!” he said, twisting, turning, trying to break free of their grasps. He felt a stinging sensation, looking up to see his sister standing in the doorway, a look of anguish on her face.

“Amy? What is this...?” he asked plaintively, his limbs suddenly heavy. “Amy...?”

Jim woke to find himself in the corner of a room full of strangers. One hand behind him to tell where the corner was, he shook the other at the strangers. “Back away, miscreants. You caught me by surprise, but take one step in my direction and I’ll show you want I’m made of. Taking me from my typewriter so I couldn’t finish the most explosive story of the decade. I’ll not let you silence me--the story will be known...”

It was not a fragrant world, limited to antiseptic, sweat, and human wastes. She looked through the reinforced window at the poor figure in a threadbare gown, pressed back into a corner, bloviating at an unseen audience around him.

“Is there a chance my brother might get better, Doctor?” she asked, turning from the window visibly shaken.

The doctor shook her head, “I’m sorry, dear. Those phantasms he’s berating are durable--they’ve survived every treatment we’ve tried, and we’ve tried everything available. It appears that no way has yet been invented to say goodbye to them.
