Dearest Aria,

I'm sorry I haven't written until now. 

You were right about it--all of it. The sword exists--I found it two weeks ago. But the sword only works in the valley. Take it outside the valley with its constant whipping, blustery winds it becomes a dull, tarnished paperweight. But within the valley--what it can teach one willing to listen. Not only did it reveal my heart's desire, it revealed me to me. I understand now. This sheet of paper is too small to contain it everything I have learned. 

It will take me another week or two to gather all the supplies I need to start the trip back. Should take about six months to make it back.

I guess anyone who might care to remember me thinks I either died or was not planning on returning. After three and a half years, I can hardly blame them. A part of me has considered the idea of not returning to the village. 

The village does not seem like home anymore. There is very little for me there, if anything. My memories of it are hazy, as if viewed through dense fog; the only memories that stand out clearly are those of times with you. I expect everyone--including you--moved on with their lives. 

I want to tell you everything I've seen and learned, but I don't want to interfere with the life you built. I just need to know you are happy. I just want to see you briefly--to thank you for everything, maybe even a brief hug--then I can leave you be. I hope whoever you found knows how lucky they are--as lucky as I was to have you in my life when I needed it the most. That's truth, not flattery--you know I was never good at that.

I don't know where I might go, or what I might do next. 

All those talks we had have been running through my mind along this journey. Maybe I should write that novel you were always bugging me to start. I've filled three journals already and midway through my fourth. Surprised, right? An entry a day, you would say. Everyday a new entry in the serial that was this search. "The beginning is always today," you told me. Now I understand. Each line adds strength; each page reminds me of resilience.

I've started rambling, so I should close. "Thank you." will never seem enough. 

Yours always,

-Q.
