I love the idea of a "choose-your-own-adventure" poem! Sometimes the best works surprise even us as we write them.

I understand. I tried creating a table (3x3) for my last PC entry but gave up and converted to linear text. Markdown is nice for being easy to "mark up" but somewhat limited in power. (But I can imagine what you describe.)

Bravo! though on your piece--I wish I could upvote it more than once. Thank you for posting it!
