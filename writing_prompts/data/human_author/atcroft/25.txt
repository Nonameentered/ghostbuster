Wow. Very well done--thanks for sharing.

I like the perspective. The pocket sundial made me wonder if this was historical or purely fictious (but that's just my curiosity).

One nit--fifth paragraph from the end, you have "They dreama different posting"--did you mean "dream of a different posting"?

Enjoyed it. Thanks for posting.
