Deputy Rogers belted out the song with the radio as she headed for home and the light of her world--her daughter. Immensely capable, a disarming smile and sunny disposition were just two of the tools in Hallie Rogers' toolbox. Her coworkers would describe her as being driven--an inheritance of growing up alone, bouncing through the foster care system. "No one changes the world who isn't obsessed," she would say when asked about her passion for her little community. "It doesn't bother me to be out there; I've never been interested in being invisible and erased."

"Units in the vicinity, we have a 10-14 at 10223 CR 620."

"Dispatch, unit 27--can you show me as 10-6 on that 10-14 at the old Thompson house? And can you call my sitter and tell her I may be a little late?" she responded

"Roger, unit 27. I'll let Cindy know."

The wind picked up, whipping a tree limb against the house. Deputy Rogers reached for her lucky pendant, rubbing it between her fingers before cinching her vest a little tighter and stepping out of her cruiser, the gravel between the weeds crunching under her feet. The wind picked up; flashlight up in one hand, pistol in the other, she crept onto the porch, cringing mid-step as a board squeaked under her step. 

The front door swung open at her lightest touch. "Dispatch, 10-24--I'm 10-40." She heard two clicks before only the wind reigned. Slowly she inched inside. She remembered her last time here, dropping by to say good-bye to the Thompsons the day they left. A moving company would be there next week; no one should be here tonight.

She kept to the wall as she went upstairs. A flicker of light from the master bedroom. She stepped into the doorway. The floor creaked.

A blinding light. The sudden impact of a body colliding with her. Her flashlight and gun went flying. She wrapped her arms around them as the two of them slammed into the wall. The figure twisted--trying to break her hold--and slammed her head-first into the wall again. Hallie head-butted her assailant, reeling toward the stairs.

Hallie pushed herself to one knee, looking around for her gun as the assailant came at her again. She saw stars as a punch landed, throwing one of her own for the face in the darkness. She tried to dodge, but their grasp on her uniform shirt and vest made her an easy target for repeated angry blows. Her strikes became wilder--she could feel the assailant's profuse sweating--punches soon becoming scratches and swings for her life.

Hallie's focus narrowed as she tried to fight back. She knew the signs--an addict, robbery to get cash for their next hit, the dangerous rage.

The assailant--trying to abscond--released her, Hallie collapsing to her knees before them. She reached instinctively for her pendant, her mind betraying her with thoughts of her child at home.

Flashes of lightning outside lit the hallway. She saw the crazed eyes of her assailant change, and he reached for her pendant.

"W-w-where did you get that?!?" he yelled at her.

She tried to brush away his hand as it reached for it. "Only thing I have... from my birth mother..." she said, trying not to pass out.

He reached inside his shirt, pulling out a pendant. As her head swam and she sat back on her heels, she caught a glimpse of it through her one still-open eye. Her mind withdrawn, its last thought before darkness took over shook her to the bone: *How do you have my mother's pendant?*
