Thanks for the feedback--I'm glad you enjoyed it.

I was going for a realism, if I could. The MC is someone for whom this "reunion" with their parents is a visit to the cemetary, and weighing on them is that visiting was a point of contention before.

It probably was more short story than poetry, but I'm not sure how I could have put that into a more "poetic" form. (*Thoughts? _Anyone...?_*)

Again, glad you enjoyed it and thanks for commenting!
