Jordan Reynolds sat in the lobby, his thoughts several years and millions of miles away. He was startled back to reality when the secretary touched his shoulder, and followed mechanically through antiseptic hallways to the office to which he was led. He sank into a chair he was offered before the door was closed and he was left alone again with his thoughts. He barely registered the presence of the man who entered. His responses were numb, robotic.

“We were all sorry about Maggie. I saw you at the service at Arlington, but--”

He closed his eyes, trying hard to focus on anything but the dread..

“... The bodies of Captain Maggie Reynolds; Commander--”

Jordan shook his head.

“...were recovered on days 11 and 14--”

Emotions he had forbidden clutching at his throat.

“Jordan, Jordan!”

Jordan looked across the desk into the eyes of Director Peters as the older man weighed his words. “Jordan, what the report doesn’t say--won’t say--and that can never leave this room--is that Maggie was the last survivor of the crew. The autopsy results indicated that the others died of injuries, but Maggie *buried* them--sewed them into sheets and covered them with Martian rock.”

“How’d she die, Director Peters? And what actually happened?”

“Some things are unknowable, some shouldn’t be known, and some things we were not meant to understand. They found her away from the hab. The boys in the back rooms are still trying to figure it out.” He reached in his desk, pulling out a ragged, singed yellow book. “She was holding this when they found her,” he said as he handed it to Jordan.

“This book--we met reaching for it. She asked if she could take it with her, a piece of us to ground her,” he said as he slid his thumb across the cover. “I told her it was a violation of the order of nature. Dust we were, and dust we will become, but that dust was not meant to mingle with the dust of other worlds.”

“Then why’d you let her go to Mars, Jordan?”

“It was her dream; how could I say no?”

“Jordan, if there’s anything we can do--”

Jordan nodded, sinking back into his own thoughts as he shuffled out of the office, the secretary escorting him to the elevator.

His trip home was equally as automatic, as if his mind went into sleep mode for the trip. Inside he fell back against the door, sliding to the floor, clutching the book tightly. Surprised by the wave of sadness choking him, he smacked the book against his knees. The sound of plastic skittering across tile broke the spell.

He crawled over to it--a tiny microSD card. He slid it into his phone and looked through the file manager. He opened one of the early files.

“Day 91. We‘re here. It hasn’t sunk in yet--I’m on Mars.”

*Maggie.* His heart skipped a beat.

“We all know it’ll take a while to process. Only thing missing is Jordan, but I’ll keep this so I can tell him all about it when we get back home.”

Jordan spent hours playing and replaying each file as he slowly made his way through them, trying to touch Maggie through the screen.

“Day 116.”

*Two days before comms went out,* Jordan thought. 

“Yuri spotted something while on a geology run, beneath an outcrop. We agreed tonight to go back to that formation to investigate further. Will advise Mission Control during our scheduled check-in before we head out.”

He advanced to the next file.

“Day 117. My God. The site was incredible. The Universe--this changes everything we thought we knew--”

Jordan cursed as the image pixelated. The next file failed to open. He continued.

“Day 119.” A soot-stained and disheveled Maggie stared back at him. “They’re dead. They’re all dead. I got them killed. I--”

As it cut off, Jordan shook the phone in spite of knowing the futility.

“Day 120. The hab is mostly destroyed. I’ve got to go back to the structure, but it doesn’t feel right. After I bury the others I’ll make my way back there. Place gives me the creeps, though.”

More damaged entries frustrated Jordan. 

“Day 140. I can’t stay here any longer. Going to make my way back to the hab. The rover is dead--I’ll have to walk back. I wish I could tell Jordan about what I’ve seen, or even just see him again. The book--my last connection to home. I have to try. Jordan--”

“Maggie--” he gasped back.
