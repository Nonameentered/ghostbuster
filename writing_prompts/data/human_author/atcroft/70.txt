The sun beat down on him as he stood there, his clothes almost hot enough to burn. The voice seemed to drone on as his mind wandered. Amazing where one's mind goes at a time like this.

He thought of that evening when he told her he was going out west to make his fortune, that he would send for her when he could support her as she deserved. Had it really been only five years earlier? That night was the last good memory he still held, one he took out only rarely these days to consider for fear of soiling it. The next day he headed off into the unknown. The untamed wilderness held endless possibility. 

He remembered how his blood ran cold the day the news reached the little outpost where he was, how he went into the little general store and spent a week's pay on that Colt. The problem with wearing a Colt was that you better be able to use it if it came to it, and that he had learned to do quite effectively.

As opportunities moved he followed, realizing that his only useful skill was as a gunslinger. Sometimes he sold his guns to protect a shipment of some sort, other times supporting one side or another in some dispute. Between jobs loneliness and boredom drove him to other arms, firewater helping him forget the one who waited even to this day.

His mind went to that day, not two months ago. He had just arrived from the trail, so dusty it was hard to tell where his horse ended and he began. After weeks on the trail, he cleaned up and headed for a bar as darkness fell.

In the bar his money bought him drinks and attention--not all of it good. He had tried to avoid a fight, offering to buy the young cowboy a drink, turning from one lady to another only to find another aggrieved cowboy. When the cowboy seemed to reach for something it was muscle memory and reflex that took over. A shot rang out... When the circuit judge arrived, there was really no choice. The cowboy, drunk as he was, had no gun to reach for that night; the verdict was obvious.

His reverie was broken as the voice stopped. A grizzled man stepped before him.

"Hood?" the man asked asked.

He closed his eyes, shaking his head in silence.

"Anything you want to say?" the man asked.

Again he shook his head. Looking over the assembled crowd, his gaze met the eyes on him.

"Let's get this over with," he said hoarsely to the grizzled man.

The old man nodded. Time seemed to slow down, the thump of the trap door dropping hitting his ears as he felt the rope tighten around his neck, his world going dark.
