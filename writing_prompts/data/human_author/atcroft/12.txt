Very evocative! I liked it.

I don't have any criticisms. As I read it the speaker is looking in on their sleeping love while trying to decide if they must flee (whether to avoid something, or to seek their fortune I can't tell--the last stanza suggests the latter, the rest the former). The repeated "refrains" ("...I wish that this was just a dream." and "The moonlight yields to Sun's fiery beam.") weave a pair of interesting threads through the piece that "tie up" in the final stanza. The heaviness of the decision on the speaker is palpable at the end.

All-in-all, well done. Thanks for sharing.
