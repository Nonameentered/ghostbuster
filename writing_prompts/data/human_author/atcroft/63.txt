Ants at a picnic,  
You're everywhere I turn.  
The restaurant where we met,  
The theater that was a remembered date,  
A shadowy figure beyond a fogged window  
Your memory--uninvited--haunts just behind my eyes.  
  
Everywhere I turn,  
There you are.  
Though no one else sees it  
Thoughts of you--  
Of us--  
Torment me.  
  
Nowhere am I safe,   
If my mind can wander.  
One moment's idle thought,  
A sight--  
A sound--  
And to your memory my mind flies.  
  
Can you release me,   
Set me free?   
How can I move on?   
Must I leave all I've known--  
Move--  
Just to be free?
