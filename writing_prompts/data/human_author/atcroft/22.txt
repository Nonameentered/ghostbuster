Sometimes you need to scorch everything to the ground and start over.

I should know--I am the seventh of my line.

I was enjoying a nap in the lazy afternoon sun when I saw them approach. The license plate was a dead giveaway--an underdog hoping to immigrate from the city. I had an interest in the outsider. 

As I watched, the rust fell from my cobwebs like salt from a shaker. I slowly realized what I had to do.

I started with the simple tricks, but nothing seemed to work. Every time you find something that doesn’t work, you’re a step closer to what does work. But over the weeks it was apparent that I’d run out of tricks before I ran them off.

As the month ended, I settled into defeat, out of options. I watched as they came up my drive, hopping out and pulling up the sign in front. As they swung open my front door, I resigned to the realization that once again I am haunted by humans.
