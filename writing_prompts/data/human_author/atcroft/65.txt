I am so glad you enjoyed it. That it gave you a chuckle is quite a compliment.

I have never been great at verse, so I decided to go with "poetic imagery" (hoping it would be considered "blank verse"). 

It really was the first thing that came to mind when I saw the topic (although my first version came in a few words light, so I added two lines near the beginning). I suspected most people would go for the "awakening" or "welcoming" Spring mode, and I wanted to try something a little different.

If I were better at poetry then I might try fixing the syllable count, or maybe even the scheme, but like many of my attempts at cooking I'm just glad I got something edible (a.k.a. enjoyable). :)

Thanks for the feedback!
