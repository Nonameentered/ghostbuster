There are some who say   
Everything that can happen, will --   
Not Murphy, but many worlds.   
Like a room full of prisms   
Rays bouncing everywhere   
But we follow only one.   
   
Some say it’s all in the odds   
That God plays with dice --   
And nothing is really known, until   
__Measurements and    
Reality collapse.__   
   
Maybe there’s a pilot wave   
Maybe it’s “it from bit”   
Or maybe -- just maybe --   
Magic exists and things happen   
If only you believe.
