Unable to sleep, Eliza Reynolds stared up through the transparent roof at the Moon. Often if she couldn't sleep she would come to the conservatory, walking among the plants, brushing the leaves with her fingertips. For Eliza the conservatory was a place to feel alive, a place of memories of both unspeakable happiness and heartbreak. This time of night always made her introspective, but the events earlier had been a shock. She stared at the open journal, unable to steady her hand.

Eliza was the current caretaker for Mrs. Maudi Ewell, the last remnant and survivor of the Ewell line. She remembered growing up around the Ewell mansion, where her mother served faithfully for years. On the sudden death of her mother, Eliza had fallen into her mother's position as Mrs. Ewell's assistant, becoming her caretaker when the matron's health declined as the only person she didn't fight. 

Eliza considered her current charge, and the energetic lady who spoke with authority of her youth, and felt badly for Mrs. Ewell, hoping somehow, somewhere deep inside the old dowager appreciated her efforts. Sometimes she wondered how much her charge was actually aware of these days. It felt to Eliza that Mrs. Ewell's decline was accelerating; she wondered if a century of despair was just catching up with her.

Eliza looked through a year's care journal for her notes on anything Mrs. Ewell reacted to; she responded so infrequently these days. After dozens of pages she decided, snapping the journal shut. She got Mrs. Ewell out of bed, bringing her down to the conservatory to enjoy a partly cloudy spring day. Mrs. Ewell lay reclined in the pale sunlight, eyes closed and mouth agape. Light gently warmed her bluish skin, glinting off a drop of drool collecting at the corner of her mouth. 

---

Eliza could tell Mrs. Ewell was napping--her eyes were closed more than normal. She learned to read the smallest of changes in Mrs. Ewell of necessity. She made notes in the care journal; they would have to do this again for soon.

Staying within sight of her charge, she walked among the flowers, inhaling slowly, deeply. The air was weighted with the smell of flowers and warm, damp earth. The occasional glance would confirm her charge continued sleeping peacefully. 

Thoughts of many a happy childhood day transported Eliza to times as a child learning to help Mrs. Ewell with the plants. Eliza smiled, her mind continuing to drift. Memories continued of afternoons reading under large, cool, leathery leaves; of listening to the patter of rain on the glass ceiling; of whispered secrets. She shivered at the vividness of the memories after so many years. Her reverie was broken by the door bell.

As she walked to the intercom she looked over at Mrs. Ewell still fast asleep. She punched the call button. "Yes?"

"Delivery for the Ewell residence." came a strong, vibrant response that punched her in the gut. She felt her knees go weak, lowering herself to the bench below the intercom panel.

"Can you please put it in the cart beside the door," she replied trying to mask the shakiness of her being.

"John-nie," came a hoarse whisper from behind her. She looked to see Mrs. Ewell's eyes wide, color in her face.

*It can't be Johnnie,* she thought. *But it sounds so like I remember him.*

"Johnnie," the old matriarch's raspy whisper repeated questioningly, as if matching Eliza's thoughts.

A few moments later the voice crackled over the old intercom again. "It wouldn't all fit, so the heaviest items are on the cart. Have a great day."

"'Bye," she said instinctively. She heard their vehicle crank up and leave. Her breathing was rapid, shallow; the hairs on her arms and neck stood at full attention. She looked over at Mrs. Ewell, who had returned to her pale, unresponsive self, slowly dozing back off.

Eliza's mind raced at the puzzle. The gangling youth, her partner in crime for numerous good-natured misdemeanors investigated by either her mother or Mrs. Ewell, had been a resident of the family crypt half a century. Was this her imagination, brought on by thinking of childhood playtimes and shared secrets? Mrs. Ewell's reaction suggested otherwise, but how could this be?

---

She continued the rest of the day taking care of Mrs. Ewell with her normal competency, but her thoughts were class-5 rapids, swirling and crashing behind her eyes. When her work was done she went by her room, retrieving worn, tattered, decades-old journals and returning to the scene of the crime.

Eliza flipped page after page, her mind drifting back to those days--the lanky co-conspirator who grew into a tall, solid confidant. Games of hide-and-seek, afternoons laying in the shade of potted trees, hidden by large, cool, leathery leaves--the journal brought them all back in sharp relief.

Johnnie--how long had it been since he had come to mind? Eliza flipped to dog-eared passages in the journals, memories of those days flooding in.

> Journal entry, August 5, 1970:
> Was so scared and confused when I told Mom. Think she was as well. Told me we would figure this out, but that I needed not to say anything about it until she had time to think.

> Know she must be disappointed.

> Journal entry, August 7, 1970:
> Mrs. Ewell sat down with mother and I. She said I could still have a future, but there would be some hard choices. I didn't understand, but Mom seemed to--I saw a lump in her throat.

> Journal entry, August 9, 1970:
> Mom told me to pack; she and Mrs. Ewell had come to a decision. I would be going to a school for girls for a year or two. Mrs. Ewell had made some calls, so I would have to leave in the morning. I protested, asking if I could at least wait until Johnnie returned so I could say good-bye. Mother was adamant there could be no delay. Her eyes were red, swollen. 
> 
> I asked how soon before I could return to visit; her response was, "We'll see."

> Journal entry, August 14, 1970:
> After several days on the bus, I'm here. Had to sign a bunch of forms when I got here that I didn't understand. Will start classes on Monday.

> Journal entry, March 15, 1971:
> Saturday was the longest day of my life. 
> 
> They took it from me. I never got to see or hold it. Never even told me if it was a boy or 	girl. I screamed at them. They said I signed something when I first arrived. I think they gave me something; slept all of yesterday. 
> 
> Was told this morning they are in a better place now. I just want to go home.

> Journal entry, May 22, 1971:
> Got a letter from Mom. Said Johnnie was buried last weekend. Mrs. Ewell had just gotten a letter from him one day saying he was there and fine, and the next day a man in uniform and another in a dark suit knocked at the door. Said Mrs. Ewell has been as stiff-lipped as ever, soldiering through it all. Said she's been spending more time with her flowers.
> 
> Wish I'd been able to tell him, but they only let me write to Mom.


Eliza wiped her eyes, an escaped tear falling on a page. She breathed slowly, collecting herself as she flipped to another page.


> Journal entry, June 2, 1972:
> Was told I had "finished the program" and would be going home soon. Was surprised to see both Mom and Mrs. Ewell in the assembly audience. Afterward couldn't wait to get to them. I wanted to tell Mrs. Ewell how sorry I was about Johnnie, but she did something that surprised me; for the first time I can remember Mrs. Ewell hugged me. I felt like she might break me, but there was also a sadness behind her eyes.
> 
> As I was packing they said the drive back home will be an adventure, and Mrs. Ewell said something that surprised me--that we three girls had to "stick together". Not sure what she meant--just looking forward to going home.


Eliza closed the journal and looked up at the cold moon in the dark sky in disbelief, her mind a beehive of thoughts. *Is it even possible?* she thought. *What would be the odds?*
