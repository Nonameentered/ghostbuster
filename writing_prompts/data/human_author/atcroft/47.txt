Sea,  
One true mistress of my heart,  
Wrap me in your embrace  
As you once enveloped my mind and soul.  

You enamored me as a lad,  
And I sat forth to tame you as my queen,  
But times grew hard  
And to darkness I turned to survive.  

I learned at my master's hand,  
Every sailor's function,  
But it happened my watch  
Was the night of terrible storm.  

Lightning flashed, the sea roared,  
Gale-blown rain stung the eyes,  
Lashing myself to the wheel  
I stayed at my post.  

With morning's first light,  
The damage plain,  
The captain and a dozen others  
Washed o'er in the night.  

I took her back to port,  
Limping our way there,  
As ranking survivor  
The ship became mine.  

I tried the straight and narrow,  
But work was difficult to find,  
While a slow, fat treasure ship  
Proved a feast in the midst of famine.  

Slowly my skills as a pirate grew,  
My reputation too,  
Reputation gave me strength  
Not requiring blood.  

In Tortuga I took on four,  
Strong, able seamen,  
This brought our crew back to nine  
Each promised an equal share.  

A week out we found prey,  
A Spanish treasure gallion,  
She was easy pickings  
Her crew wanting only to live.  

We left with our booty,  
Intent to stow it safely,  
I did not know  
What was heading my way.  

We came ashore on the small island,  
Burying our treasure,   
I turned to find them staring  
And a second hole--my size.  

It seems they had been talking,  
And the thing had been decided,  
It was easier to divide  
A treasure among 8, not 9.  

Now I stare out at the water,  
Glistening as it rolls,  
Closer, closer  
My time ebbs away.  

The grit of sand on my neck,  
The salt of tide in my nose,  
Soon we will become one  
As we were meant to be.
