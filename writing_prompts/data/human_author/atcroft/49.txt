Eggs--scrambled, fried, and boiled. Sausage--patties and links. Bacon--regular and Canadian. A whisp of steam rose from the spout of a coffee pot. He was moving steaks fresh from a frying pan to a platter when she rolled into the room.

"What is all this?" she asked.

"All your favorite breakfasts," he replied, setting the pan in the sink before returning to the table. "The biscuits will be done in a few minutes, and the gravy is on low so it will be warm when they come out."

"All at once? Are you trying to make me so fat I can't get out of bed?"

"I thought you might like a nice breakfast," he said as he poured her a cup of coffee.

She floundered as she tried to pull herself up to the table. "I don't want any damn coffee," she said, enraged. She swung her braced wrist across the place setting in frustration, the cup and its contents flying off the table.

He reached for a napkin.

"Leave it!" she screamed.

"This isn't like you," he muttered softly.

"I have never been such a real person as I am today." she retorted. "Get out."

"I still need to clean the dishes," he said, backing away from the table.

"Why are you still here? Get the hell out!" she spat.

"I'm just trying to help," he said plaintively.

"I can't believe what you say, because I see what you do."

"What do I do?" he said, taken aback.

"You try to keep me embrangled. I don't know you from Adam, but you're always here, claiming you want to help. This breakfast is just another example. I like tea, not coffee; I'd rather a muffin and jam instead of biscuits--" 

He knew better than to try to argue further.

She tried to turn her chair but kept running into the table. She growled, throwing a plate; it exploded against the wall a few feet from him. She shoved against the heavy oak table; it screeched as it moved against the floor.

He ducked over to the stove, turning off the oven and the burner under the gravy. "Okay, this isn't helping you so I'll go. I'll come back tomorr--" His answer was a saucer shattering to his left. He backed his way to the door.

In a huff, she angrily muscled another chair out of her way; it tumbled to rest against the wall as she rolled herself out of the room.

He closed the door quietly behind him. 

When she woke from her coma the doctors had told him she might suffer some memory loss but he never imagined his childhood sweetheart and wife of ten years could forget the life they had built together, that she could forget him.
