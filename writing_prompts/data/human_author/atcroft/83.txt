Outside the wall time wore on, hot winds blew like the open door of a furnace, sand bit and stung.

The siege was over; the gate creaked as it opened to welcome the invaders. The hot wind seemed bound ahead of the entering invaders to reform the atmosphere within the walls, allowing the stale scent of accumulated filth to escape. 

The citizens of the small town had no idea the upheaval to come as they were ordered to gather provisions for a journey, an Assyrian soldier entering each house to ensure no one dallied.

As the citizens gathered in the street, teen best friends Simon and Jetish stood together, an Assyrian soldier examining their makeshift bundles for valuables.

"I thought there would be a great battle, that our city's name would become immortal," the younger Jetish whispered.

"Immortality is a fool's wish," an old man standing behind them, overhearing, grumbling as a soldier tossed a small family heirloom on a pile before handing the old man back his bundle.

Simon shook his head, "Made sense--why fight when you can bottle a town up and wait?"

As they were marched out of the city, Jetish looked at his friend. "Do you think we will be back?"

Simon leaned close to Jetish. "Maybe when this war is over," he said, turned for one last glance at the only home he had known, "maybe in a few years."

They wouldn't live to see it.

Outside the wall time wore on, hot winds blew like the open door of a furnace, sand bit and stung.
