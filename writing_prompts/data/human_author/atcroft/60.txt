Thanks for your response. No, I didn't think of that, but I do like the way you think! (After you said that, I can see both ways. Thank you!)

I was too busy getting a (*hopefully*) coherent story under the limit. (My first draft was over 730 words by the time the two of them separated to look for a bathroom.) I then restarted, using around 300-400 words from the initial draft as the basis for this version (and still had to cut several dozen words to squeak it under the wire).

From her reaction, I have the feeling that something else may have happened between the Cara seeing the apparition and her arrival in the car, but what that may be Cara isn't saying (not yet, at least).

Hope you enjoyed it.
