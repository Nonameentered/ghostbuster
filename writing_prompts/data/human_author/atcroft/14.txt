I stood there, looking   
At the levers before me, unhappy   
With my choices.   
   
I bit my tongue, this   
Was no place to rant, rave   
At choices that are no choice.   
   
One will say they need   
More time, or say another   
Will destroy everything dear.   
   
Another will say we’re   
Headed the wrong way, we’ll go   
Backwards oh nos.   
   
Maybe they promise   
The world, maybe they   
Should read the job description.   
   
It’s the same game we   
See each season, the same tactics   
On display if only we look.   
   
And anyone who knows   
What is what, seems drowned   
Out by those selling fear and distrust.   
   
The best of terrible choices   
Is still terrible, the scream   
Reverberates in my mind.   
   
I throw my lever   
In disgust, frustrated, wondering   
When will we get better choices.
