*I am a camera with its shutter open, quite passive, recording, not thinking.* That day I repeated that mantra as I made my way over to the only monument on the field: a simple sundial. Goosebumps rippled up and down my arms beneath my sleeves as I leaned heavily on my cane.

As the last survivor of my regiment, my soujourn to this place was duty, a required pilgrimage. To the rest of the world this field looked quiet, peaceful--waves rippling across waist-deep grass as a breeze brushed across it, all but forgotten. In my mind it is anything but.

I wish I could say I were as healed, that the scars were no longer visible. I wish I could say everything that has happened to me has been amazing and surprising--but I can’t. Some of the scars I can’t escape--the round that creased my forehead, the hand with a constant itch I can no longer scratch. Others I can hide well enough most days--thoughts of Adams, Williams, McRogers. My mind drifted to Saunders--he had the wanderlust; he was homesick for everywhere but here.

I closed my eyes, the sounds, the smells coming back in stark relief. In my mind walking the field as it was on that day--the grass ripped by machine gun fire, the smells of smoke and cordite, the cries of the wounded, the silence of the dead, the shell-holes we used for cover on that hellish landscape.

A shiver ran the length of me, and I opened my eyes; the longer my eyes were closed, the more I felt back there than here. Silently I spoke the names of my old comrades--the many whose blood stained that soil, the few of us who survived that hell on earth--once last time to say good-bye.

A weekend a few weeks later, I was returning from getting coffee. As I made my way, I found the end of my street blocked off with barriers and police cars, the sound of drums and horns tuning up. Curiosity overtook me, and I looked down the street to see floats and dancers, banners and bands. The date dawned on me, and I shook my head. This was not a day for a parade, but to remember. I turned away from the flashing red lights and hurried to my house.
