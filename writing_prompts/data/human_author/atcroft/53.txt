Thank you--I'm glad you enjoyed the piece.

I very much appreciate the feedback. I know both the items you pointed out are items I've struggled with in recent SEUS posts (for example).

When I read it to my mom this morning (the reason I was a few minutes late to the SEUS camp fire), she suggested I could write why the woman went on the spree. (I honestly wrote this one to wrap up the first one, based on a conversation with her yesterday. :) ) I guess it goes back to something I had kidded her about recently--when the characters think there is more story left than the author.
