"...I'm sorry, did I hear you right?"

Jenny nodded.  "Yeah... I'm serious.  If you want me, you need to kill her."

All I could do was stare in confusion.  "Is this because it's 12:15 and we're not home yet?  I mean, I didn't think being grounded was that bad."

"It's worse than that," she said, her eyes darting as our car approached her house.  "I swear, I need you to do this or... or I... I can't say too much."

"No, please, I need to know -- are you in danger?"

"It's... I said too much.  Just get there soon and..."

"Jenny, I'm not killing anyone for you.  You're awesome, and I really like you -- maybe love you -- but not enough to throw my life away."

"You wouldn't be!  I promise!  Just... please... you've got to."

I was thoroughly confused at this point.  On the one hand, she seemed on the verge of tears with my resistance -- this was no act.  Something very wrong was happening to her in the background and I could tell it needed to be fixed.  But murder?  Was she listening to herself?  I never knew the head cheerleader was a bit of a weirdo.

"...does she know about me?"

"She knows you exist, that's it.  C'mon... nothing bad will happen to you, but I need it!"

I thought about it for some time.  Finally, a solution came to me: humor her, then defuse the situation.  "Okay... I'll go in with you, but I don't think killing's the right answer.  We'll see."

"You'll see."  By that point, we were in her driveway, and sure enough, the lights were still on downstairs.  Her stepmom must have been waiting for her.  I walked her up to the front door, and before I could say good night or get a thank-you hug or anything, the door swung open and her stepmom stood there.

"You!"  I could sense the pure rage even as she tried to keep her voice down.  "You're late.  I told you that you were to be home by midnight.  What is the explanation?"

"Mom, I'm sorry, but--"

I tried stepping in.  "It's my fault.  I took a wrong turn, and--"

She pointed her finger at me and glared.  "You are to be silent!"  Suddenly, I felt no compunction to defend her or myself.  As for any other plans we had, I suddenly thought waiting on the sidelines was the best idea.  After all, I wouldn't want anyone to be more disappointed I didn't follow orders.

The stepmom pointed to Jenny.  "You are to go to the basement and wait for me there."

"Yes, mother," Jenny said, though in a weird unhumanly tone.  She walked with deliberate slow steps into the house, as though sleepwalking.  I had questions to ask of what the heck I was seeing, but... I was to be silent.

"You are to answer me truthfully.  Why are you with my daughter?"

"We were on a date, ma'am.  That is all."

"Why were you late?"

"I missed the exit and had to circle around on the highway."

"I see."  She seemed satisfied, much to my relief as I regained my bearings, but the next part proved that a lie.  "You are to tell me what you were hoping would happen with her."

"Ma'am, she is beautiful and friendly and I was hoping this would be the beginning of a long relationship.  And a part of me was hoping we would get alone time out of it, but the curfew made that an impossibility."

"Oh, did you?  You are to go to my basement and await."

"Yes, ma'am," I said automatically while I began to walk.  Even though I had never been in the house before, I somehow knew the way.  And while I could not stop myself from heading there to where Jenny was waiting, I knew we shared the same fear: what she would say we were to do next.
