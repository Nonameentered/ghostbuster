I'd modify that: if you do use slang, invent it.  Don't use YOUR generation's slang.  Joss Whedon was really good at getting teen talk down in Buffy the Vampire Slayer because he relied on their mannerisms and found places for shorthand that didn't exist.  Also, make sure the context is clear.  If the slang needs to be explained, either by the teen or the narrator, it's bad slang.
