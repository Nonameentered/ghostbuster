"You couldn't do it either?"

"No... I tried swimming for miles, but I didn't even feel any lactic acid build.  You?"

"Haven't eaten in weeks.  Still don't feel any hunger.  No slowdown, nothing."

"...they really did it."

"We're immortal."

"I thought they were kidding!  It all seems like... some bad TV movie."

"Like the Twilight Zone."

"Never saw that."

"Well, if we find anywhere on Earth with a TV, I'll show you."

"..."

"..."

"...you sure this is Earth?"

"Might as well be.  Earth plants, earth seas, earth everything."

"Everything but earth people."

"Well, yeah, they said they unleashed that killer germ."

"Right, yeah, and gave us immortality to make sure we didn't get sick.  Thanks a LOT."

"Some gift.  Who wants to live forever?"

"I didn't know you liked Queen."

"Of course I do."

"Well... bet Freddie's laughing at us now."

"Another 7 billion bite the dust.  Ugh, I feel bad laughing."

"Don't... we're alone.  Forever.  Earth is... basically a dead planet, and we're stuck on it.  So now what?"

"Honestly, I don't know.  I didn't think we'd talk this long."

"This long?  How long has it been?"

"Six months or so if I've been counting.  Not that it matters... this place is like Groundhog Day."

"...AGAIN."

"Ha!  So there are things you've seen."

"Everyone knows that movie!  ...well, everyone KNEW it.  Now everyone does, 2-0."

"Two.  Never thought it would come to this, did you?"

"...come to what?"

"Oh, uh -- it's not important."

"Is this about the prom again?"

"Sorry... asking you was the last normal day we've had."

"...oh god, are you mad at me?"

"I should be... but I can't be.  You're still the same beautiful girl I asked.  I took a chance.  I'm mad at myself."

"...okay, I'm sorry I said it.  I had just gotten a D on my math test and I saw my first choice ask someone else.  I got on a power trip."

"...was that it?"

"Yeah!  I mean, if you'd asked me a couple days later, I'd have said maybe."

"...well... what if I asked now?"

"Asked now?  C'mon, Casanova, where's the prom?"

"Well... here."

"The middle of a forest?"

"...look, I... I don't want you to feel obligated to be near me.  I'm just asking."

"Well... I wouldn't say we go our separate ways.  I do think you're a good guy.  Just... I miss everyone."

"...so do I.  But how long do we mope?"

"...I don't know.  We've spent the last few months trying to die."

"Why did you try to die?"

"...I was hoping I'd meet everyone again.  You?"

"What's the fun when your only companion is someone who doesn't like you?"

"You THOUGHT that?"

"Why not?  After what you said..."

"Look, I... if I had more time before... before THEY showed up and... I would've said sorry.  I spent all this time wishing I could have."

"...then why didn't you?"

"We never really talked about ourselves before, did we?"

"...good point.  Well, my dear friend... my companion... my only help..."

"...my closest kin... here we are.  I..."

"..."

"..."

"...were you as lonely as I was?"

"Y-you were lonely?"

"Yeah!  I thought I burned you forever with how I... I mean I... I thought I was gonna be alone."

"So now what?"

"I, uh, guess what I'm saying is... after thinking about it all this time we were... well..."

"...the thoughts crossed your mind?  I thought only us guys thought like that."

"Nah... but... well... I guess I can say I began to... well... let's just say there's no maybe anymore.  Let's see what happens."

"Thank you, beautiful."
