"What brings you here?"  Yakub wasn't certain of Isaac's motives.  "Is this a trap you have set?"

"I promise it is not.  I know your hesitance, but the fact remains: this war has gone on for too long.  Neither side really remembers why we fight, just that it's always been.  And as a result, our populations dwindle, our futures stutter."  Isaac hesitated as he looked at the guards his opposite number brought.  "The time has come to try a new approach."

Yakub bowed his head.  "You may be right.  Our clan has become thirsty for a time without worry about death.  Our resources are stretched thin.  I do not wish to admit this to an enemy who would capitalize, but you seem honest."

Isaac nodded.  "Our clan has been at war for survival for too long.  I feel like an easier path to survival comes through peace, not war.  Our lands combined can become a dynasty... but only if we co-operate."

Yakub looked over his shoulder and, with a nod, told the guards to stand outside the doors.  "Understand this, sir," he said.  "I still do not know if this is a truth you are presenting.  However, there are too many among us who would refuse to believe it.  Village leaders who condemn your existence, a black market that fears a lack of war for arms, and a people who desire to be seen as blameless.  I take a great risk just being here."

"Would I call you if I were not sincere?  Would we be here, outside our borders, if this were a setup?"  Isaac looked around and, with a point, sent his guards to the doors from which he entered.  "I assure you, too many of our people just wish to know they can grow old as a natural state.  It is in our nature just to defend.  We are tired of it."

Yakub shook his head.  Defense, as Isaac claimed, was not even half of what the opposing clan did for the centuries of fighting.  He had been taught of their barbaric tactics in the past, and of how their protocols dictated the extinction of his people.  But... even with self-delusion still rooted deep, if Isaac wanted to bring an end to the evil, it would be welcomed throughout the lands.

"Let us sit down, then," Yakub offered.  "Our ministers are available; they will help us with an accord.  Then we will know how serious your offer is."

The negotiations continued.  Books opened, numbers flew, and hours became days.  But as the two sat in their tent in the middle of a far-flung land, a mutual understanding grew.  It was clear to Yakub that his foes were no longer the monsters of myth or legend.  And for Isaac, a willing ear proved to be the salvation his lands needed.

After weeks of talks, the last of the ink dried.  Isaac and Yakub had but one step left -- to sign.  Isaac's smile of relief said all Yakub needed.  "To lasting peace between our nations," Yakub said with an offer of his clan's finest spirits.

Isaac reached forward... and as he did, his eyes went wide.  His face contorted in pain.  He slumped down on the treaty, blood from a stab wound covering its words, rendering it illegible.  Behind him, one of his own guards, holding the knife with a wild-eyed glare at Yakub.

"Death to traitors," he shouted before Yakub's guards could take him down.  Weeks of goodwill died with Isaac.  The process would begin anew.
