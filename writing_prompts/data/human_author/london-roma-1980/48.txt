*In a hotel in Copenhagen.*

ANDY-1: "I know it'll sink in and I'll move on.  I'm sorry, it has to."

CRYSTAL-1: "Take your time."

ANDY-1: "I just... everything went as wrong as possible.  We had a perfect plan... how... why?"

CRYSTAL-1: "It wasn't a perfect plan.  It was a plan.  No plan is perfect... and what if they were prepared anyway?  Our Stone dies with their you... and maybe with you, too."

ANDY-1: "I... it couldn't be that easy.  I was ready to die.  I was ready to take them out.  So was Other Me.  But we live while someone on the sideline dies?  How is that fair?"

CRYSTAL-1: "Look at me.  Look at our world.  Now, think about their world.  Life is never perfectly fair.  Life never makes sense.  I don't get it either.  But we got them here, and we did something good, right?"

ANDY-1: "I... guess so.  But I don't see how we improved much.  The Empire's not dying... not yet.  And we can't make it die.  I'm sorry, Crystal; I failed you and your dreams."

CRYSTAL-1: "You always knew they couldn't happen.  Don't blame yourself.  We're together; that's all that matters now."

ANDY-1: "We are.  But them?"

*Back at the lab, after all the cleanup is done and Hart-1's body has been removed, the radio sounds again.*

HART-2: "Alt-Bohr, come in.  Alt-Bohr, please come in."

ANDY-2: "I'm here.  What do you need?"

HART-2: "I just want to let you know that your vigilance in ending Commander Stone has not gone unnoticed.  I owe you a debt.  Please tell me if there's anything at all I can do to repay you for striking this great blow for the Resistance."

ANDY-2: "Do you happen to have your own portal to our world?"

HART-2: "One can be constructed quickly.  Why do you ask?  Do you wish to return?"

ANDY-2: "That is impossible.  But I know what you can do... I will send you the location of where our children are staying.  Please... bring them to us."

HART-2: "...well, it may not be possible.  I'm sure there will be guards surrounding the area waiting for the Resistance.  But we've done crazier hostage rescues, and we do have some who are experts in it.  We will do our best.  I promise."

ANDY-2: "Thank you.  I know I can't go home again... but maybe now, I can bring home to me."
