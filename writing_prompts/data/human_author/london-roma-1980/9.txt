Ooh, I like this, very Star Trek feeling to it in a good way.

One thing I'd note: if Sir Malcolm has indeed commandeered several missions, I'm surprised he's allowed to pilot at all.  The word you want is "commanded".  "Commandeered" means hijacked.  It took nothing from the story, though.

A little too bad it ended on the cliffhanger of what the secret was, but word count gonna word count.  I'd love to see you expand this in a \[PI\], though!
