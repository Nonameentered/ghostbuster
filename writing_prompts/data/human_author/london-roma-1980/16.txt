"We have to."

"I can't."

"It's for your own good."

"Not again."

The argument raged on between us in her head.  We were poised to open the door to go outside, where I knew we'd find Matthew, our Homecoming date, with another gal.  But my backseat driver Stefani kept telling me not to do it.  So there we stood, holding the door handle, seemingly thinking of whether to go any further, while we argued over what to do next.

We may have been there for too long if it hadn't been for a voice shocking us out of our distraction.

"STEF!  What's going on?  You all right?"I jolted back in control of us and turned to face the voice.  Carolyn was staring at my arm outstretched for the door.  "In or out, girl.  It's like you got zapped."

"I... uh... yeah.  It's not that easy."

"What?  Why not?"  As Carolyn questioned us, I waited for Stefani to jump in, but she seemed to be a little too quiet.  I guess this whole situation may have been too much -- first Brian treats her horribly, then her next date cheats on her?

"Um... it's Matt.  They told me he's outside getting a smoke, but... does he?"

Carolyn seemed to be figuring out something.  "...I, uh... haven't seen him."

"Right.  So... what's he doing?"

"...oh.  And..."

"...well, I don't know if I wanna know.  What if he... not again.  All this work to get back to a normal life and this?  I'd be a joke."

"No, Steffy... this isn't your fault."

"I don't care!"  I wasn't acting the way I wanted to act, but knowing the Stef was so frightened by the very thought of being humiliated she couldn't even step in at a social event... well, I had to defer to her a bit at this point.  Not enough to flat-out refuse, but enough to present her argument.

"Stef... don't let him walk over you.  If he's doing this, you deserve to get back at him.  The Steffy I know would want to see for herself and not be the sidecar, right?"

"...Care... I don't want to get hurt again.  Please... just... tell me to go back to the dance."  I heard a whimper in the back of my head as I asked.  Clearly I was getting her mindset right.

"No, Stef, I'm not letting that dork do this to you.  I know you're scared.  But we're gonna do this.  C'mon, I'll come with you."

Finally, my hand pushed the door.  *I'm sorry, Stefani, but you got outvoted*, I thought to myself/her as we walked outside.

I motioned for Carolyn to peek around the corner first.  She stuck her head around, ducked back, and nodded solemnly.  That's all I needed.  I stepped around the corner to see what I knew was there.  Matthew was oblivious to the world around him, and on his lap was Serena, clearly happy to be there.  And yes, they were kissing like the teenagers we were.  I half-expected to gasp or to choke back a tear, like I heard in the back of my head from my co-pilot.  But something else happened.

I.  Got.  Pissed.

"WHAT THE HELL!?" I yelled in their direction, causing both Matthew and Serena to whirl in shock and stare at me.  Far from crying, I was fuming.  "Just what do you think you're doing, anyway?  You call this bitch a cigarette?  Is that it!?  How fucking stupid do you think I am?  You worthless asshole think you can humiliate me?  Take this!"

I was so into the moment of fury I was clutching my purse in my hand rather than hanging it over my shoulder.  And the more I saw them, the more I saw red.  Before I knew it, I had my arm over my head, purse in hand, ready to rain it down on that cheater and the other woman.

Before I could go any further, I felt someone grab my wrist and yank me backwards, nearly knocking me down as my heels got caught in the sidewalk.  "LEMME AT HIM!" I bellowed, but it was no use. Two arms grabbed me and hugged around me, keeping me from getting up and trying to calm me down.

Matthew and Serena ran back into the cafeteria through an alternate entrance.  I was seething, panting in rage, practically foaming at the mouth as I watched them run off, unable to escape the human trap I found myself in.  The anger subsided and I felt myself return to a more human response, as if I was a lady Bruce Banner and the anger burned away.  Adrenaline was replaced by... well, no serotonin, no dopamine, nothing.  And with nothing, the sadness just flowed.

I finally heard a calming shush, like a mother to a child, from behind me.  It was Carolyn -- of course it was.  "Steffy... it's okay... it's going to be fine... everyone will know what happened. It's not your fault.  It's not your fault..."

I wanted to say something, anything.  But the emotional roller coaster left me just sobbing in my place.  Two drops of makeup fell and stained my dress.  I felt like collapsing into the earth, out of this body, and anywhere else.  When the chips were down, maybe Stefani was right.

I looked up slowly.  "So... what now?"  I was slowly getting my emotion back.  I had no idea what Stefani would've done different if she controlled herself, and it was clear she didn't want to find out either.  I was on my own in this one, at least in my head.  In the world, I had the best helper I could.

"C'mon -- that bench needs new people."  We sat down, just the two of us, and she offered tissue after tissue for me.  "It's okay.  It's not your fault.  But man, what happened to you?"

"To me?  He happened!"

"Well, yeah, but you weren't even that mad with Brian!  I mean, apparently."

"I... got pretty loud with him, you know."

"Not like that.  You were screaming.  You raised your voice before, but this was hooboy.  That was freaky."

"...you're thinking it's freaky to be mad at getting humiliated like that?"

"Steffy... you were scared, then you were mad, and over some guy you didn't even really LIKE like.  What happened?"

I had to stall for time to think of an explanation, even with Carolyn being such a close friend.  It's not like she was going to understand, right?  "Well, uh... people could see it, and... what would they say if I just melted?"

"Was he meaning something to you?"  I couldn't exactly say I knew Matthew, because she didn't.  "Is that it, Steffy?  You liked him, didn't ya?"

"No...!  No, I didn't!  I meant it, it wasn't like that.  I just... it was all..."

"Okay, okay, this is too soon," Carolyn waved me off.  "Listen -- you're coming home with me.  Call your mom and have her know.  We're gonna talk this out tonight."

I giggled uneasily.  "C-care, I... I just... got mad.  It's not a big deal."

Carolyn looked around before continuing.  "It's not just that, you know.  It's all the... everything.  The wreck still bothers you, and you can get on with it all you want but I can tell it's in your head.  You're all over the place.  It's like there's a whole bunch of Steffies up there trying to tell you what to do.  Your head's out.  I wanna help."

Before saying anything, I listened for the voice from Stefani's real self to tell me what to say.  Eventually, I felt her switching into control again before choking off another sob.  She had us look up at Carolyn and smile.  "Thanks... I'll call Mom.  I guess I haven't been myself lately."

"No kidding you ain't.  We got a LOT to figure out.  C'mon -- let's get cleaned up and say goodbye."
