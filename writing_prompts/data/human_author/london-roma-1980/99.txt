Twenty-five years.  At least, I think it's been that long -- tell the truth, when time disappears, time has no meaning.

My Circadian rhythms remain, though.  I've slept and awakened.  Oddly, I haven't been as hungry as I thought I would be -- it helps that telomeric decay is attached to time, and there isn't time.  Sure, I've eaten where I can -- the local supermarket has been depleted heavily, but they'll never know it was me -- but for the most part, I've been an island in a still life.

It was twenty-five... wait, hang on... yeah, let's say 25, sure.  Way back when, I got my first magic kit.  It took me a few easy jokey movements to realize it was all real.  It all began when my sister was bothering me about pretending I was a wizard while I was waving around my wand.  I looked at her, rolled my eyes, and said, "God, sis..."

And the next thing I knew, where my sister had stood was a beagle, whining and growling at me.

I should've known to put the wand down and go to manual first thing, but she was so cute.  And in a few days, she got used to her new life as well.  And while owning a dog wasn't in my life plan, taking care of family is.  So while I fed and nurtured her, I looked for a way to fix this.

"To undo a spell, you must RESTORE its victim," said the manual, with unusual capitalization as if I knew what that meant.  "A reminder: The victim's name need not be a part of the spell, but must be clear in your mind or your phrasing."

So while you may not care how this started, I can tell you how we got here.  I was boiling some rice as part of my dinner that fateful night when my sister... puppy... ugh, anyway... when it was time for a walk.  I figured the best thing I could do was let magic make sure the rice cooked just enough.  So I figured, I could set a timer for cooking, walk away, and be done.

"Time pots," I said.  And then a huge whoosh followed.

When I recovered from the surprise, I saw the flames under the water were stock still.  I turned around to check on sis, and she was at the door, normally wagging tail permanently cocked to the side mid-wag.  I freaked out and waited for things to be normal, but after an hour, it became clear everything wasn't going back.

I stepped outside my house and looked into the street.  Everyone in the neighborhood was standing still, as if in a photograph.  Kids jumping rope hovered in midair.  Basketballs stayed on the rim, leaning but never succumbing to gravity.  A car was rounding the corner, but did not advance further.

It was then I knew... this was BAD.

In the 25 or so years since, I've come to terms with being the only real human in a tableau of a city.  I've thought about messing with things while no one could stop me, but mostly I've limited it to making sure that when -- if -- time resumed, there wouldn't be any potential disasters.  I did move a child out of a busy road that a car was heading down -- don't know what the kid will think when they materialize on the other side.

There are days I get lonely... more and more.  I've given thought to bringing someone into my house and pretending they're my companion, a living doll, but if I ever get out of this loop, they'd have a bit of a hard time reconciling it.  No, for now, I just pet Sis and look at the stove, wondering just how to get out of this mess.  How do I restore time?  It must be staring me in the face, but I can't think of it.

I'm sorry, world.  I guess I deserve this time alone.
