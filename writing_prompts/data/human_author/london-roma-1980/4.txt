I like the chemistry you two wrote into Tim and Naomi.  Oracle's idea of how the camera would work opens up a lot of possibilities too.

If you two don't mind, when judging is over on Friday I would like to go back and write a <4/3> on this to keep it going.  I feel like this just scratches the surface.
