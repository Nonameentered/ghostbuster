ACT II: WORLDS APART

*Scene: where we left off at the end of Act I.*

ANDY-2: "I'll take this.  You come with me."

CRYSTAL-1: "Why me?"

ANDY-2: "He knows a lot.  As soon as it became clear he knew I was not from this planet, I told him what I did know.  I was trying to keep this a secret, using Wikipedia where I could to fill in the gaps.  My goal was to make sure they'd force our kids to be here rather than us there."

CRYSTAL-1: "What?  But... did she..."

ANDY-2: "Your counterpart knows very little.  She's busy all day with housework and mothering.  I had to tell her the Queen died!  But... the more you know of our life, the better.  You, other me, stick around in case my wife calms down."

ANDY-1: "Got it."

*Andy-2 and Crystal-1 meet with Drs. Hart and Stone.*

ANDY-2: "Okay... I'm the one you want, but she isn't.  My Crystal is unable to talk right now.  I'll answer for both of us."

DR. HART: "Thank you.  Though I wonder if you realize how you sound when you say this."

ANDY-2: "How I sound?"

DR. STONE: "We have received a transmission from your world -- if we may call it Earth-2 for short?"

ANDY-2: "...sure."

DR. STONE: "Thank you.  It says that your government believes you to be a fugitive from justice who has kidnapped someone and that they believe we are harboring you."

ANDY-2: "I was afraid of this.  This is because of the ANZUS Annexation."

DR. HART: "Explain."

ANDY-2: "Well... from my research on Wikipedia, I can tell that this universe split off from the one I'm from many years ago, with the rejection of the multiverse as fiction."

DR. STONE: "How long have your people known of this multiverse?"

ANDY-2: "Since before I became a diplomat at the US Embassy in London -- a job which let me meet Crystal after years of chatting."

CRYSTAL-1: "Aww."

DR. HART: "But besides that, it appears that the worlds are identical."

ANDY-2: "Were.  About three years ago, the fracture became more permanent and a lot less bright.  It began in New York..."

***Note from the Fourth Wall: Andy-2 describes the changes in the political picture between our world and his.  As a political rewrite is beyond the scope of this subreddit per Rule 7, I will not include it except to say that the US and UK are at war on a dystopian Earth.

ANDY-2: "So that's why my hope was that if we do find a way to pass from one to another, we could get my children and be free."

DR. HART: "What of your families?"

ANDY-2: "My sister maybe, but she's under constant surveillance by the government.  You have to understand, both nations embrace [Big Brother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_(Nineteen_Eighty-Four))."

DR. STONE: "I see.  That would explain their claims.  You are an American, and so describing an accident as a kidnapping gives them a cause to rally against."

CRYSTAL-1: "Would they kill you?"

ANDY-2: "I don't want to find out."

DR. STONE: "Very well.  Since we have the five-dimensional coordinates of the Earth-2, we can try to pinpoint your family and make sure they are safe.  The rest, you must understand, is beyond either side's technology for now.  But I'm afraid they have a head start."

ANDY-2: "But they contacted you, so they don't know where I am."

DR. STONE: "Hopefully.  Good luck, all of you."

*Call ends.  For the first time in his time here, tears appear on Andy-2's face.*
