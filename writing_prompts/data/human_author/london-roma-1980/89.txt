"Good heavens, that's wonderful.  Where is she?"

The old lady smiled.  "Liv, darling, you got friends!"  Olivia emerged from the back, dressed in the same smock as the store owner, much to the absolute horror and surprise of her high-class friends.

"Olivia??"  Gwendolyn was almost furious.  "How could... what are you doing?"

Olivia bade both silent.  "I am sorry, but I could not communicate my circumstance in public.  Tis my husband Reginald -- I'm afraid he is no longer the man I married.  He is a danger now, reduced to the worst habits of the bottle.  The pain of seeing him hurt too much on my heart..."

Olivia paused and lowered her smock, revealing to the other ladies several red lines around her shoulders.  "...and on my body.  For my life and safety, I must remain here until I am informed he has ceased his poor behavior.  Please... tell no one."

Emily looked to Mrs. Habadashere.  "Is she safe with you?"

"Always," the store owner smiled.  "Why, I've taken in ruffians and women alike who had to get out of a bad spell.  This here hatmakers shop is the perfect hideout.  Reggie won't ever find her, cross me heart."

"Thank you... I suppose..." Gwendolyn stammered.  "But I guess we must be going."

As they left, silence reigned in their carriage for a full ten minutes.  Finally, Gwendolyn spoke to Emily.  "Can you believe she would walk out on Reginald like that?  And here to think she was supposed to be a proper wife and lady!  The bridge club will be aghast about this scandal!"
