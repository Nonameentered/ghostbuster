I followed the noises.  I saw her.  She had on a heavy coat -- perhaps too heavy for the weather -- and had her head in her hands.  I had to check in on her.

"Danielle?  Is something wrong?"

She didn't even look up.  "Go... go away..."

"I can't.  You seem hurt.  What happened?"

Danielle finally sniffled loudly.  "They... they're gonna ruin me..."

"Who will?"

She looked up.  I could tell her first thought was that she didn't recognize me, which is to be expected -- in a school as large as ours, people can keep separate.  "The jocks told the chem teacher I did it."

Oh, lordy.  A few weeks ago, there was a massive fire in the chemistry lab.  Apparently someone got a hold of a brick of pure sodium and threw it into the distilled water container.  So much heat being released at once caused some serious damage to the teacher's back room.  Half the school got boarded up from the resultant fumes, too, and the principal promised that someone would have to answer to the law.

Heck, I was lucky to escape.  I was trying out for the TV quiz show coming up, hoping to represent the school in some competition.  Yeah, I can't tackle or dribble, but it's something.  I'd like to think I was doing okay before the deafening boom from a few dozen yards away, too.

"Does he believe them?"

"Who cares?  Everyone else will!  I'm ruined!"

"I don't believe them."

Danielle stopped in her tracks, wiping her nose.  "Yeah, but you... I mean..."

She was emotional, so I didn't hold her thoughts against her.  Actually, I was happy to complete them.  "I'm just a nobody student?  Yeah, so I've been told.  It's all right -- I'd rather be socially awkward with my nose in a book than be like the people framing you."

"...well... thanks, but... so what?  What's gonna happen to me?  They'll want nothing to do with me, I won't get into my college, everything's just..." She blew into her coat sleeve.  "Oh, god, I must be so gross."

"Danielle... where were you when it happened?  Were you in the school?"

"...no... I was coming home and I got stuck in traffic.  Why?"

I was about to risk my entire reputation on someone who didn't even care what my name was.  "I was; we were running Scholarquest tryouts.  You know, on top of everything else, you're known to be pretty smart.  How about you join us today for practice?  Maybe you'll find something to get your mind off of this."

Danielle shook her head.  "What if I'm expelled tomorrow?"

"If you show up, I guarantee you won't be expelled.  We will say you're part of the team.  The coach is one of the most respected teachers here.  If she says you're in the club, you were in the club... when it happened."

"Y-you'd do that for me?"

"An innocent person shouldn't be expelled."

Danielle picked herself up, embarrassed.  She grabbed her backpack and put it over her back.  "Tell me what room it is.  I'll just fix my makeup and meet you there."

"131."

"Thanks... um... I'm sorry, but..."

"Ben."

"Thanks, Ben.  Thanks a lot."
