DR. HART: "Ah, I see everyone seems to be on the same page now.  Fortunately, we haven't received any follow-up on threats to anyone.  It's possible they're giving us time to reply, or it may have been PR."

ANDY-2: "Dr. Hart, with all due respect, it doesn't matter what he's thinking of doing.  I mean, he's probably trying to poison my rep, but... I'm not worried about me.  You all know me.  I'm worried about my family."

DR. HART: "I see.  Well... I unfortunately have to remind you that we're not as advanced in multiversal technology as they are.  If we were, I'd absolutely send a message to them stating your safety."

ANDY-2: "I mean, that's part of my concern, but also... what will the Empire do to them?  I'm a wanted criminal being used in a media frenzy, I'm sure.  They'll be looking for me in the usual places.  Like with family."

DR. HART: "Again, what do you want me to do?"

ANDY-2: "Yeah, I get it, I get it -- there's no going back right now.  But... it's the... the not knowing, Doc!  Can you at least look at their world?"

DR. HART: "A little.  The experiment is prototypical.  The co-ordinates of the message we received, unfortunately, only track to a survey tower in their Manchester.  It appears that for now, only sites that see each other can talk to each other.  But there is another thing about that: they make sure to have their news television on at all times.  I can't hear anything, but I can see the news ticker and the pictures."

ANDY-2: "You can?  Anything.  What do you know?  What's going on?"

DR. HART: "Well, I... I mean I haven't been observing it all day.  This experiment requires me to be in several places.  But given we're on the verge of a breakthrough, I have been paying it more attention.  We're doing everything possible to find out how to make communication two-way."

ANDY-2: "...they'd never let my family talk to me.  Ugh."

DR. HART: "Maybe not, but what's important is that communication is the first step to controlled contact.  We can also use this technology to aim where we spy in this universe.  It may be that we fully cross in the vicinity of Earth, which would allow us to have a chance to make a solid bridge.  Of course, given the instability of civilization on the other side, perhaps just viewing would be best at first..."

ANDY-2: "Doc... this is my family we're talking about."

DR. HART: "...I see."

ANDY-2: "Do you?  Don't you understand that children could be in big trouble?"

DR. HART: "With all due respect... science can't take things personally.  You know, you go down that path, you get [people making up lies about medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield) for a quick buck.  I can't just think of you two... well, four.  Multiversal communication needs to be seen for its benefits to the greater good.  I wouldn't feel right as a scientist otherwise."

ANDY-2: "Dammit, how can you sit there and--"

ANDY-1: "Hey, hey!  Easy, man!  I've known this guy longer than I've known my wife.  He's dedicated, all right?  This is his field.  If it's possible to get you home, he'll figure it out.  And if it's possible to get the kids here, he'll figure it out."

ANDY-2: "...and how am I supposed to know if they're safe until then?"

DR. HART: "We can have someone observe the opposing tower's news.  If there's a red flag, I'll do my best to report.  I'm not heartless... just, you know, don't expect miracles."

*Andy-2 buries his head in his hands.*

ANDY-1: "I get it.  I think it just... you know, we're essentially being forced to tell him there's a good chance he can't help his children, and... well, you just can't tell a parent that."

DR. HART: "Sounds right.  Believe me, the first thing we're working on is adjusting the view of entry.  If we can get it to move around the planet, I will... well, it's not science, but I will ask for a special view of his family's house.  I can't promise I can keep it there -- one data point is pretty bad and all."

ANDY-1: "...what do the grant people want out of you?"

DR. HART: "They want to know controlled multiversal interaction is possible.  I can't just bring you out -- your duplication was an accident.  And on top of that, you know they'd ask me to get the other them from this Earth-2, and then I'm not really advancing anything; I'm just selling out."

ANDY-1: "I wouldn't want you to do that.  I guess all I'm saying is there's a direct urgency now.  If you can get people out of the other Earth... start with the kids.  Please."

DR. HART: "Makes sense.  Test load capacity on a smaller item.  I suppose we can.  In the meantime, all I can say is that I have no news.  We're looking in on what they can do, and we're trying to replicate or reverse-engineer their work."

ANDY-2: "Are you talking to you?"

DR. HART: "...oh, uh, no.  No, my counterpart does not appear to be in the tower.  That doesn't mean I won't do my best to determine the right approach.  I've spoken to Parliaments and to Congress.  I know a little diplomacy."

ANDY-1: "If you need any help on phrasing, let us know."

DR. HART: "Will do.  I gotta get back to work.  Bye."

*Call ends.  Andy-1 looks at Andy-2.*

ANDY-2: "I'm dead to them, aren't I?"

ANDY-1: "For now.  But life finds a way."
