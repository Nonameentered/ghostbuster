Jason followed Brick -- he had no choice, for the crazy dog was practically sprinting.  He went along a dark path Jason had never been to before.  It led through an unfamiliar wooded area, past boundaries and fences where not even authorities had gone.

Jason felt nervous.  He kept trying to get his new pup, Brick, back onto the path -- away from the unknown.  But when a dog makes up its mind, it is almost impossible to dissuade.  Even picking the dog up resulted in whining and barking that Jason couldn't stand.  There was no choice; he followed.  Brick led.

Brick knew the area from before he was adopted by Jason.  Through one path, around another three, beneath a branch right at his human's head height.  All of it was familiar, recent memory to the dog.  The final destination lay ahead.  If this worked, all would make sense to Jason.  He could heal the human's heart in a moment.

The dog finally stopped at the side of a giant lake.  Green covered the surface, with bubbles occasionally being released.  Brick barked to Jason, as if to indicate this was important -- not that Jason fully understood.  A tug on the leash and a whimper didn't help -- Jason assumed Brick wanted a swim.

In a way, he was right.

But when Jason took Brick off of the leash, the dog just barked more.  It became nervous at the edge of the swampy pool.  A confused Jason looked to re-attach the leash, but Brick grabbed the other end for an impromptu game of tug-of-war.  Jason was ill-prepared for this, and the combination of being bent over and being pulled caused him to lose his balance.

At that moment, both tumbled into the lake.  It bubbled harder.  The green became temporarily red, then black, before returning to green.  An hour passed.  Nothing.

And then, as the lake became clear, two dogs emerged, shook the water off, and wandered through the forest together.
