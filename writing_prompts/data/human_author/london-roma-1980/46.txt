"Well, I'm glad I was able to take time with you.  What did you say your name was?"

"Mary Smith."

"Mary Smith... the most common first and last name."

"Is it?"

"Yeah... sorry, just..."

"Why are you interested in me?"

"Well, to be honest, a lot of people at the job have felt off talking to you.  I haven't, but they say that it's the fact you don't seem to have any unique quirks."

"Quirks?  Am I supposed to?"

"Oh, you're still you without them, but just consider -- five foot six, average US female height.  Mary, most common US female name.  Smith, most common US surname.  Your salary... well, it's the median salary across the US.  And this job you do is the most common in the US.  Living in the suburbs, partial college education, father retired from business, mother stayed at home..."

"I get it, I get it!  Everything about me is what you'd ask someone to think the typical American 20-something is.  I never thought of it that way.  But why should that matter?"

"Well, to me it doesn't, but aren't you approaching the marrying age?"

"...yeah... wait, are you saying I need to marry you to preserve this stat?"

"Oh, no, I'd never!  Just that it's weird you're approaching the time and there's no one in your life."

"See?  There you go -- something I'm not yet average in."

"I guess so."

"Don't worry about it -- would you like to come in?  It's been a while since Mom's served anyone.  She'd be glad to have you."

"Well, I suppose I could... it would be nice to see this family Little Miss Middle of the Road comes from."

"Sure... let's go."

\*\*\*\*\*

"Hello, Mary, thanks for inviting me over."

"It was no problem.  But... you seem to have something on your mind."

"Well, to be honest... I did find it strange when your garage had a car trunk in it attached to the other car."

"Oh, that?  Pay it no mind.  We use it as an extra trailer."

"...okay... but your house seems to be missing a wall."

"Hm?  I never noticed.  Oh, the top floor?  Yeah... some people I guess just want extra sunlight.  Come on in... here's Mom, here's Dad.  And this is my sister.  And here's our brother."

"...oh no..."

"What?"

"...h-his legs... why doesn't he have legs?  Where'd they go?"

"He was born that way.  What about it?"

"...th-this place.  Your table is round at one end and not the other... the oven's too small... the... the clock... no minute hand... how do you live like this?"

"Doesn't everyone?"

"No!  Not at all!  I... I better go.  I'll see you at work Monday!"

"Wait, come back, it's okay!... oh, darn.  Gone again."

"...did I scare them off, Mary?"

"It's not your fault, brother.  He knew about me -- doesn't he know the average family has two and a half children?"
