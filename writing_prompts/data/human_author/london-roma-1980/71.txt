ANDY-1: "It's always Mario Party with her."

ANDY-2: "Tell me about it."

CRYSTAL-1: "You're just jealous of my skills."

ANDY-1: "For the last time, the game is luck-based!"

CRYSTAL-2: "Sounds like something a loser would say."

ANDY-2: "He is not!"

CRYSTAL-1: "You're the one in last."

ANDY-2: "...I'm just... preparing for Chance Time."

BOTH CRYSTALS: "We win!  High five!"

ANDY-1: "...you do still destroy her in FIFA, yeah?"

ANDY-2: "Even with an MLS team."

CRYSTAL-1: "What time is it?"

ANDY-1: "It's... oh, my, it's midnight!  We've been at this a while."

CRYSTAL-2: "Midnight?  What, do you have a curfew?"

ANDY-2: "He's right; you two have to talk to that doctor tomorrow."

CRYSTAL-1: "...okay, I guess.  So who gets the guest bed?"

BOTH ANDYS: "He does."

*An awkward pause as they stare.*

CRYSTAL-2: "Seems settled to me.  We get the main bed."

CRYSTAL-1: "...could they fit in the guest bed?"

ANDY-1: "Yeah, the guest bed's smaller.  If we're going by person, you'd go in it."

ANDY-2: "Or we could go by couple."

ANDY-1: "...well, yeah, there's that.  But then what?"

CRYSTAL-2: "Look, we were the ones home first.  You... other people get the guest bed."

CRYSTAL-1: "But it's our house!"

CRYSTAL-2: "You sure about that?  This may not even be your PLANET!"

CRYSTAL-1: "You're being rude!"

CRYSTAL-2: "You're being a jerk!"

*Pause, then:*

BOTH CRYSTALS: "Say something!"

ANDY-1: "Look, honey, it's okay.  We were the outside couple and it's only for one night, I hope.  We can mix it up later if it takes longer."

CRYSTAL-2: "You don't even know which one you're talking to."

ANDY-1: "Well, if the inside Crystal wants to mix couples, that's very interesting, but the Crystal I know would never..."

CRYSTAL-1: "Guest bed it is!  See you there!"

*Scene: the next day, via videoconference.*

DR. STONE: "Hello, ladies.  I've been informed of your case by my colleague Dr. Hart.  It's fascinating to meet an intersect that gained people.  But I understand one of you will need to get back home."

CRYSTAL-2: "Yeah -- we can't leave the kids with Grandma forever."

CRYSTAL-1: "Besides... what would they think?"

DR. STONE: "That's not important right now.  Right now, we need to see if we can tell the two of you apart.  I have a series of facts that we've found through extensive research are the most volatile in alternate universes.  The chances are that for one of you, the answer differs from what we're familiar with.  I want each of you to give the answer you believe to be right about your home.  Understood?"

CRYSTAL-1: "Sure."

CRYSTAL-2: "Let's get this overwith."

DR. STONE: "Thank you.  Let's begin..."
