Ashleigh felt herself struggle against the large grip, but to her amazement it didn't squeeze or hurt in any way.  The longer the large figure walked with her, the more comfortable she felt.  By the time the figure set her down, she was calm, serene, and more content than she had been since her arrival on earth.

She looked up, and despite the bright light shining around her, she could see clearly.  It was a figure she didn't know but felt familiar with, his bright blond hair encircled by a halo.  The figure bent down and looked Ashleigh in the eyes.  "You are worthy," he said.

"W-worthy?  How?"

"We placed your spirit on earth to make it choose.  Some of you choose to get stronger and harvest soul energy.  They go to their home, and they become the monsters of myth.  I'm sorry, but there's no saving Riven -- I could only get you away from him."

Ashleigh took a deep breath.  "You did enough," she finally blurted out.

"You... you chose to be one of them, and to help them, even as they didn't quite understand you.  You did not take their energy.  For that, we see you wish to protect, and we welcome you to the Department of Guardians."

Ashleigh felt herself getting lighter, healthier, and stronger.  Her dark outfit morphed to a bright white.  As the metamorphosis ended, she was in the same white and same halo as the figure.  Ashleigh, for the first time in years, felt like she belonged in a group.  She had her destiny.

"Thank you... sir..."

"Please," said the figure, "call me Michael."
