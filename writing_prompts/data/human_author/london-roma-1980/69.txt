*Scene: Later, a different teleconference.*

ANDY-1: "So what do you got, Doc?"

DR. STONE: "I couldn't find anything in major events that would allow me to discern who our visitors are.  However, I can tell you that they have distinct personalities.  This isn't a perfect replica; there will be an answer."

ANDY-2: "Is it possible that something about our upbringing would change, even though we still met, still got married, and the world still acted the same?  Why would our wives be different?"

DR. STONE: "You'd be surprised how little it takes to turn a small quirk.  I admit there's a lot that's unusual, but perhaps knowing more about how the two... two of yous... became couples would help."

ANDY-1: "Well, uh... I... I don't know..."

ANDY-2: "Are you embarrassed?"

ANDY-1: "If we met the same way, then it is kind of weird."

ANDY-2: "Why would it be weird?  The Internet's just a part of life.  Why would it be so strange?"

DR. STONE: "Are you saying you started through online dating?"

*The two Andys look at each other sideways.*

ANDY-1: "...something like that."

ANDY-2: "Well, not an official site, but yeah, we first met online."

DR. STONE: "Social media is a fact of life.  Don't be ashamed.  Now, I noticed you two have distinct American accents.  Did you emigrate?"

ANDY-1: "Yeah, when it became clear we were meant for each other."

ANDY-2: "It was kind of hard to tell Mom and Dad about it."

ANDY-1: "You struggled?  Dad's mother is from England.  It's not like we're strangers there."

ANDY-2: "I get that, but it still means we would almost never see family in person.  We essentially became her family, not ours."

ANDY-1: "A son is a son until and all that."

ANDY-2: "Don't tell me you don't miss them."

ANDY-1: "Well, I was a loner most of the time before I met Crystal.  Most of my communication was online."

ANDY-2: "Not the best way to live a life, is it?  Didn't get to tour the East Coast with your friends doing shows on Saturdays?"

ANDY-1: "Not after the pandemic."

ANDY-2: "You should've kept it up."

ANDY-1: "Maybe, but then I'd have run in different circles.  What are the odds I'd find her?"

ANDY-2: "I did."

ANDY-1: "How?"

ANDY-2: "Shouldn't the doctor ask the questions?"

ANDY-1: "Oh, right.  I should be better than that."

DR. STONE: "No, no, everything you say is something we can use to determine who's who.  Now, what's the biggest thing about being in Britain that you feel is better than the US?"

BOTH ANDYS: "Her."

DR. STONE: "Okay, that part's understood.  I meant culturally."

ANDY-1: "The history.  Like, every place around here is older than the US is."

ANDY-2: "I like the healthcare.  Beats having to shop for it when it's assumed to be yours."

ANDY-1: "Not like it cost us much back in the States."

ANDY-2: "It was enough."

ANDY-1: "She's made you health-conscious, hasn't she?"

ANDY-2: "Won't even touch pizza."

DR. STONE: "Okay, I now know which of you goes with which of her, so that's a bit of a help.  Let's work on some fact-checking..."

\*\*\*\*\*

*Living room, that night.*

CRYSTAL-2: "So what do they know?"

ANDY-2: "Well, we're almost the same in every way, except one that's going to help us quite a bit."

CRYSTAL-2: "Yeah?"

ANDY-1: "Yeah, turns out our blood types are different.  So it's just a matter of checking my medical records and we'll know.  But I'm sure we'll find out we belong here."

ANDY-2: "What if you don't?"

CRYSTAL-1: "...well, I guess this whole thing's been just a weird fever dream.  We'd just go home and no one would ever believe us."

CRYSTAL-2: "So we'd never see each other again?"

ANDY-2: "How could we?"

CRYSTAL-2: "I don't know... but I feel like we've all made friends here and we're all so close as it is."

ANDY-1: "Okay, but you have kids to go home to.  You want to orphan them just for... more you?"

CRYSTAL-1: "No, not that!  Just would be nice to see each other a few weekends a year like we have now."

CRYSTAL-2: "It's like having a twin sister."

ANDY-1: "Well, I see your point... but what can we do?  This whole thing was never supposed to happen.  It makes very little sense.  The whole thing is just a bizarre twist of life that we meet people that have no business being in our lives, and now you want them to stay there?"

CRYSTAL-1: "Andy, dear, you're describing how we met in our own lives."

ANDY-2: "...she's got a point."

CRYSTAL-2: "C'mon, me, I have an idea."

*The two Crystals head off to a side room.*

ANDY-1: "What are they up to?"

ANDY-2: "If I know her, nothing good."

*A pause, then...*

ANDY-1: "How well do you know her?"

ANDY-2: "How well do you know your her?"

ANDY-1: "Hopefully well enough."
