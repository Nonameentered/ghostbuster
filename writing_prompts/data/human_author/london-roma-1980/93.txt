"Mr. Smith, I'm here to help you.  I need you to leave Mr. Blair alone."

"Yes, I know what happens to you.  But it's important."

"No, I don't know what you're thinking, Mr. Smith.  I'm just here to make sure Mr. Blair lives."

"No, I'm with the regular police.  You're free to think however you like."

"I know you don't want to go back... I understand.  But this solves nothing.  You'd cease to exist if you did this."

"Everything.  Even your hope.  He did it all."

"I need you to understand, Mr. Smith... if this doesn't happen, millions in this world will be in a worse position.  He is using you as a warning for the world.  Do you want others to suffer the way you have?"

"We'll look for this... O'Brien fellow if it'll help, but you're not making yourself look innocent right now."

"Yes... that's it... put the knife down and let Mr. Blair go."

"No, wait, sir -- Mr. Smith, please... I know your story.  All of it.  Please understand you live.  And you live happier than you do now.  Everything will work out for the best."

"...yes, even you and Julia.  I'd never hurt her."

"Listen... everything's going to work out.  Listen to us... it's past 2020.  We're speaking the old dialect.  They failed.  Everything failed."

"You can't stay here if you kill him, though.  That's the first thing you need to do."

"Please.  Julia would want it this way."

"Thank you, Mr. Smith.  Come with us.  We can get you help.  I'm sorry, Mr. Blair, but we'll take care of this shortly."

"...war?  Us?  No... we have diplomatic ties in both Eurasia and East Asia.  Why would you ask, Mr. Smith?"
