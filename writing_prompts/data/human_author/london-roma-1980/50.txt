ACT V: NEW LIFE

*Both Crystals stare at the horrifying scene in front of them.  Andy-1 slowly stands up and helps Andy-2 to his feet.  Both look down at what remains of Stone-2, her half-body motionless.*

ANDY-1: "Self-defense."

ANDY-2: "I know."

CRYSTAL-1: "I'm going to be sick."

ANDY-2: "Head outside and find Stone.  She can help."

*Crystal-1 immediately exits the lab with haste.  Andy-1 looks around and sees Hart-1, flat on his back, scorch marks on his face and a bright crimson on his lab coat.*

ANDY-1: "Dr. Hart... Louis... Lou!  Lou, are you all right!?  Come on -- we'll fix this!"

*Hart-1 slowly pulls his head up and struggles to breathe.*

HART-1: "No... This is it... I knew it might be... I could not stand by... and let... someone... die... whatever... it meant..."

ANDY-1: "Look, we'll get you fixed up.  It's a muscle cut, nothing more, I promise."

HART-1: "My... my heart... I feel it weak... struggling... It's been hit... It's too late... for me..."

ANDY-1: "Lou!  No!  Please!  You can do this!  Don't... don't go!"

HART-1: "It's over... Andy... my friend... you live... I know... you have nothing... to fear..."

*Andy-1 simply looks at Hart-1, tears in his eyes, cradling his head.*

ANDY-1: "I'm sorry, Lou.  This should've never happened!  I'm sorry."

HART-1: "You're not... at fault..."

*They share one last eye contact.*

HART-1: "I am blessed... to have... met you... all..."

*Hart-1 closes his eyes and slumps in Andy-1's arms.*

ANDY-1: "Lou... LOU!  LOU!!!"

*Andy-1 leans back against the nearby wall, seated, and just begins bawling his eyes out, wailing in agony.  Crystal-2 comes over to console him.*

CRYSTAL-2: "I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry."

ANDY-1: "GET OUT!  Leave me alone!!"

*Crystal-2 quickly backs off, leaving Andy-1 in the middle of the crime scene of a lab.  As she leaves, the radio sounds again.*

HART-2: "Alt-Bohr, come in!  Come in!  This is Lewis Hart of the Resistance!  There was a crisis alarm by the Science Center!  What's going on?  Someone, answer!"

*Andy-2, the only person of right mind in the room, avoids the bodies on the floor and walks to the radio.  He looks one last time at the portal before replying.*

ANDY-2: "This is Andrew Roma, Earth-1 representative, would-be fugitive, and member of the Resistance.  It is my duty to report that Commander Stone has been permanently dispatched."
