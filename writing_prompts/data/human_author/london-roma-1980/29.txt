I didn't know when I was dating Mia for the first time.  In fact, it wasn't until six months in she let me in on it.  It turns out that at her high school graduation, some creature long thought mythical gave a surprise appearance.  Apparently, her grandfather spared the creature's life during a war, and as a result he was owed a favor.  And that favor, well...

"So, yeah, I have an X factor like in the comics."

I didn't quite know how to react.  There were a hundred different such powers that could exist, with powers anywhere from flight to healing to shedding skin.  But the very fact it was real, it was true, seemed unthinkable.  And why tell me?

"Is this common knowledge?"

"No," Mia sighed.  "Only my family knows.  I promised I wouldn't tell anyone else, but since we seem to be soulmates and all, I guess you needed to know.  I'm basically a mutant.  Well, I guess the best word is shapeshifter, but that seems too high a word."

"Oh?"  I was hoping there'd be a hint as to how I was supposed to think about this.

"You're not curious?"

"Oh, I am, but honestly -- as long as you're the you I know, it doesn't really matter.  You're beautiful, smart, resourceful, and friendly.  What more could I want?"

Mia looked around, as if to make sure no one was peering into her windows.  "Okay, it's just us," she said as if relieved.  "So it's not like I can be anyone ever.  The creature said I could become anyone or anything I was familiar with.  What I've figured out is that it means touch.  If I've touched someone or something, I can mimic them.  Well, also I can change a few things about me, but that's minor."

"Minor?  Mia, you're practically a goddess now!"

"I don't feel like it.  I... I feel kind of fake.  Like, there's this part of me I have to hide because I'm basically a freak.  I have to keep reminding myself what I really am because if I didn't, I'd... I mean I... I'm scared of forgetting who I am."

I held her in my arms to keep the tears away.  "Mia... I know who you are.  It's not about what you show me, and if you need to remember we have pictures to remind you.  It's about what you give to me.  Nothing can ever take that away.  I promise."

&#x200B;

It's been a year since we got married.  I've been trying to help Mia accept and get the most out of her power.  As of now, she mostly uses it to prank me, whether it's pretending to be on TV when she is the TV or coming to the door as someone I don't recognize and pretending to sell me stuff.  It's the little things keeping our relationship healthy and fresh.  Or so I thought.

"Dear?  Do you still love me?"

"Whatever gave you the idea I didn't?"

"I mean, do you love me as... me?  I know what I do, but I keep thinking you're going to ask to change me for good."

In her defense, there would be times when I would joke about having her as an extra appliance around the house if something broke down, or even to be a sexy celebrity.  I didn't realize that such jokes hurt as much as they did, but it's pretty clear I misread the situation.  Again.

I'd like to say this was a blindside, but it seemed like we had this conversation a lot.

"Mia... is this because I joked about Comic-Con?"

"It's not just that.  It's not even just you.  I feel like my parents want me to do stuff too.  My sister's always talking about sneaking me along on a blind date as her purse to keep her safe.  And I'm scared to tell my niece, because who knows what she'd want to do.  I might be a stuffed animal for good!  I kind of wish I didn't have this power."

I gave her a quick kiss on the cheek to reassure her.  "Honey, didn't I tell you that it didn't matter?  That I still felt you, the real you, the one inside is what counted?"

"Stop saying it like that, it sounds like a line!"  Mia shrunk herself down to a few inches tall as she curled up in a ball.  "I feel like a silly little toy for all of you!"

I was stuck.  Nothing I said could make her feel better about herself, and honestly, what psychiatrist would possibly keep her powers a secret, or even know how to respond to that?  But Mia was never about her supernatural abilities.  She was always about being my love.

"Mia, please -- you're going to disappear if you keep that up.  And I'd be very lonely without you.  Where would I ever find someone as smart and as kind and as generous with herself as you?  Everything about you is perfect as it is.  I promise."

Mia turned her back to me.  "Then why keep asking if I can be something else?"

"Wait, you do this to yourself, don't you?  I thought if you were okay doing it for you, you'd be okay doing it for me, too!"

"Oh, so I can't have fun or I become a toolbox?"  Mia turned around, staring up at me with her tiny eyes.  "Is that it?  Is that what I am?  Why don't I just sit in your closet, then!"

"Now wait a minute, Mia, I'm not the one who's trying to take advantage of you!  You say no, I drop it, you know that!"

"Oh, that makes it so much better now?  You think you're some white knight because you only ask to use me instead of demanding it?"

"Mia, what brought this on!?  You're acting like I'm some crazy monster keeping a damsel in distress!  You're my wife!"

"Then ACT LIKE IT!  Don't you just-OW!"  Mia had gotten so mad she shot up in size, banging her head on the ceiling.  She began to laugh from her own clumsiness, slowly restoring herself to her default size as I cuddled her head.  "I'm such a jerk, I'm sorry."

"No, Mia... no..." I shushed her as I rocked her head in my arms.  "You're in a tough position.  You have no one to talk to.  I'm here for you, I promise."

I could hear sobs coming from her.  "B-but..."

"Did something happen today?"

"Well... she did."  Mia altered herself to look like her sister.  "Oh, Mia, dear -- I need to look good for the ball tomorrow and don't have a dress.  Can you help me out?  I don't wanna spend any money."  She changed back to herself.  "Is that what I am?"

"No, Mia.  She's wrong.  You're you.  You're no comic book character.  You're... special even without it.  I promise."  A loud sniffle emanated from her.  "It's gonna be okay.  I'm here for you.  Take your mind off of her."

Mia took a deep breath to calm herself down before kissing my nose.  "Thanks, dear," she got out.  "I'm sorry I took it out on you."

"Why don't you stand up to her more?"

"Family.  I don't want to be the entitled one."

"Doesn't matter -- you're going to tell her the answer's no, right?"

"...well... I could..."

"You need to.  You need to stand up for you.  Look at me -- the more you do things for others, the more you're going to feel like you don't matter.  And I don't want my wife to think that way.  If you say no to me a hundred times onward, I won't mind.  If you need to say no to her, you do that.  She needs to appreciate her sister, not a magician she shares DNA with."

Mia had a quick laugh, but I could tell it was cheering her up.  "Could you talk to her, though?  I feel so... well, so empty."

"Hey, Mia, wait -- don't go being a balloon on me now.  You know how much effort it takes to blow you back up?"

Mia smirked.  "And I thought men liked their women inflatable."

"HEY!"

The laughter showed that, whatever state her emotional outburst and her greedy sister had left her in, it didn't last.  She squeezed her arms around my neck and gave me another kiss.  "You go tell her what you told me.  I'll be waiting for you."  Mia walked off to the bedroom of our apartment, flinging her shirt over her shoulder as she did.

I picked up the phone and dialed calmly.  "Hey, Kim?  We need to talk about your little request."
