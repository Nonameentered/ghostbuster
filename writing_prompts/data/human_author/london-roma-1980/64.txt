CRYSTAL-1: "We have to!  Billions of people suffering under a bunch of dictators?  They need us!"

*Andy-1 takes a deep breath.*

ANDY-1: "Just... let's review the facts here.  We don't know if or how we can get to their world; we're four people against a militia and government; if we try anything, their families will die, including their children; and if we try to recruit from here, who the heck's going to believe us?"

CRYSTAL-1: "But we HAVE to!"

ANDY-1: "I agree someone has to.  I also think asking US to do it is crazy.  We have bigger worries right now."

CRYSTAL-1: "But... but..."

*Andy-1 kisses Crystal-1's forehead.*

ANDY-1: "It's okay.  Saving the world is a long-term goal.  We have to think short-term first.  Be patient."

CRYSTAL-1: "I hate when you say that."

ANDY-1: "But you know it's true."

CRYSTAL-1: "......okay."

CRYSTAL-2: "So what do we need?"

ANDY-1: "Just about everything.  Think about it: you're in a place that has no record of you.  You're not on the register.  No birth certificate.  No unique ID.  And while we'd love to help you, if all this became public -- which it would -- you two are basically science for the rest of your lives."

CRYSTAL-2: "We have to hide?"

ANDY-2: "I hope not.  I don't know how we would."

ANDY-1: "I think hide is too strong a word.  Lay low for sure.  But... well, let me ask you: how do you think Leo would react to seeing the four of us?"

CRYSTAL-2: "...uh... I don't think he'd get it."

ANDY-1: "And if you told him not to tell anyone?"

ANDY-2: "Oh, we both know he couldn't do that."

ANDY-1: "Right.  So... that's a hurdle.  Now... let's sit down and figure things out."

*Both Andys and Crystal-2 sit down with some paper.*

ANDY-1: "Okay, first thing: you can't stay here when the kids come back as much as I wish you could.  I can talk to the science guys; Denmark is just far away enough that literally no one will have any idea you are anyone out of the ordinary.  Of course, that brings its own problems, but then if parallel universe travel is something they can get tons of grant money from, we may be able to set you up."

CRYSTAL-2: "Denmark, though?  I don't speak Danish.  Heck, I sometimes can't speak English."

ANDY-1: "Well, I was spitballing.  Where else could you go?  My understanding is most other English-speaking places are America or America-adjacent in your world, so it would take some getting used to."

ANDY-2: "I think if we're here long enough, it'll settle in that we're in a pre-2019 environment."

CRYSTAL-2: "Maybe?  You get told long enough that someone's at war and it's hard to forget."

*Meanwhile, Crystal-1 is bored out of her mind and imitating the whole thing with her hands as if they were sock puppets.*

ANDY-1: "Well, that's something we can work on.  I just don't know how much time we have.  The thing is the kids: we can't stay away from them forever, and we need to get yours over.  But then we'd have to get your kids settled into schools and... and there's no way they'd allow that."

ANDY-2: "You think they wouldn't take 'em?"

ANDY-1: "Not when it looks like they're in two schools at once.  We'd have to basically put you all in Witness Protection."

CRYSTAL-2: "What does that mean?"

ANDY-1: "You'd need new names, new homes, new jobs, new lifestyle... anything to keep people from finding you.  And that's before we find out what your Earth wants.  If they can contact us, what else is there?"

ANDY-2: "Right now, nothing.  But I assure you they're working on it.  I don't know if they want me back to have a show trial, though... their interest is in mining other planets and subjugation."

ANDY-1: "Well, then that's something to prep for, but not to worry about.  Now, in the meantime, we have to provide.  I doubt I can ask for a raise at work, but..."

*Crystal-2 starts giggling.*

ANDY-2: "What's so funny, dear?"

ANDY-1: "She's doing that hand thing again, isn't she?"

ANDY-2: "This is serious, okay?  Do you want ALL of us to get in trouble?"

CRYSTAL-1: "It's just... why is this so complicated?  Why is it so hard to take care of people who need taking care of?"

*A long pause.*

ANDY-1: "I'm going to go call Dr. Hart.  You three... I don't know.  But you're right -- two more people shouldn't be a burden."
