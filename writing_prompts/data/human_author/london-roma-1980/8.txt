Hello everyone!  First to intro myself.

I (he/him) live just outside Washington, DC, USA.  I tend to love writing with WP, and my favorite thing is if I can find a prompt that extends the story past one reply.  So far on my subreddit (r/WritingByLR80, check it out), I have a few stories that went past the original, including a long collab of about 80 pages.  I'm currently working on another sci-fi story based on a great prompt from one of our people here.

As for my writing space?  It's either my apartment room (on my futon with the TV nearby) or at my office.  I spend a lot of time going to/from work thinking about how to continue the story while on the bus ride.  I'm also available for chat here or on Discord and like to hang out with you all.

And yes, if this name is familiar, I did this week's Follow Me Friday.  SHAMELESS PLUG!  You'll also hear me at the Wednesday Night campfire from TT.

Can't wait to talk to more of you!
