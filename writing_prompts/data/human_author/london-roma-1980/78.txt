(PART 4)

It looked like it was designed to be a guest bedroom.  There was enough space for it, complete with a closet, but no bed or anything else.  Instead, I saw a giant cauldron in the middle, and the device... well, two linked devices by a wall in the view of the door.  Each device was inside a coffin-sized box.  Yeah, that seemed kind of ominous.

"Your parents will be very disappointed in what you wanted to do to my daughter," she told me.  I knew protesting would do no good -- she'd just shut me up.  "I'm going to do them a favor.  As for you, you are to take those scissors and cut a lock of your hair into the cauldron."

Without saying a word, I found myself walking over and doing as she said.  A small portion of hair went into the cauldron as I saw the liquid inside bubble and swirl.  "You are to stand back," she said, and immediately I took a step backwards.  The stepmother looked into the cauldron, then back at me, then back again.  Her smile indicated whatever was happening was what she wanted.

"Do you see that bag over there?"  She pointed by the device, where a grocery bag was sitting, open but empty.  I nodded, afraid to stretch this out any further.  "You are to put your outfit in that bag."  Inside, I was freaking out, but outside, I just began following her orders.

Meanwhile, the cauldron's contents began to solidify and grow upward.  As I finished following her orders, I turned around.  Inside the cauldron, the contents had turned into an exact clone of me!  I was staring into my double, like looking into a mirror.  Without the clothes I had been wearing, there was no telling who was the original and who was the copy.  Suddenly, everything made sense.

"Original," she spat out, pointing at me, "you are to go into that half of the mental equality device."  I calmly walked and entered the box, closing the door as I did.  I felt shackles grab my arms, legs, and waist.  The circle of leather and iron lowered down onto my head.  I tried to struggle, but it just made the restraints stronger.  I didn't have to see through the door to know what was next -- my copy was entering the other box.

Suddenly, I felt a surge of some energy going through my entire body, from head to feet.  I wanted to scream in pain, but the power was so much it overloaded my senses.  It felt like my head was being punched from the inside, like my whole body was being rattled and struck inside and out.  The whole thing became too much as I begged to pass out, but I couldn't even receive that reprieve.

When finally, everything ended, the door opened.  "Original," the stepmother spoke to me, "you are to enter the closet and hold still, waiting for the next phase of your consequence."

"Yes, ma'am," I said in an otherworldly voice.  I slowly walked to the closet, opening the door.  As I did, I saw Jenny -- I was guessing the original Jenny -- still in her trance, still waiting.  I stood myself next to her and closed the door.  Neither of us could do anything but make eye contact with each other's faces and bodies.  We had both been replaced by clones... but what of us?  All we could do was wait, helpless.
