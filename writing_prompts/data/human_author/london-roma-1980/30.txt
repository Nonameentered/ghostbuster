DING! End of Round 1.  I return to my corner, staying standing to make a point.  The champ keeps his eyes on me the whole time his cornerman talks to him.  He never took a back step.  He kept on me, forcing me to duck and dive.  He gives the glare of a champion.

DING! End of Round 2.  I take the seat on the stool and get some water.  The champ listens intently to his cornerman while I hear encouragement from mine.  His face remains pristine, without a trace of leather contact.  I can feel something from when he bounced his fist off my gut.

DING! End of Round 3.  His forearms have gotten between me and my target on every swing.  The champ licks his lips.  This is the round he dominates coming up.  I can feel a spot under my right eye beginning to react.

DING! End of Round 4.  I gladly sit down, as another 10 seconds may have been too many.  The champ leans forward in his corner, ready to burst off the stool and continue landing his shots.  My cornerman says his guard stays up a split-second too long, but I don't know if I'm strong enough to take advantage.

DING! End of Round 5.  The doctor gives my right eye a cursory look, but I can still see through it.  In the haze around me, I notice some sort of rub being applied to the champ's torso.  Could it be?  Did I get through his guard?  If I did, the champ refuses to let me see the result of my work.

DING! End of Round 6.  I stagger to the corner, still reeling from the eight-count I took a minute prior.  The cornerman shows concern, but they say I'm good to go.  The champ has his hands up even in the corner.  Eighteen minutes and he looks fresh.  How does he do it?

DING! End of Round 7.  Vaseline goes over a cut on the champ's face.  My right eye is swelling up, but I refuse medical attention.  I can see the tiredness he has.  I'm getting my third wind.  For the first time in his career, in his reign, and for the first time in this fight, I'm not facing the champ.  I'm facing a boxer.  And *I can beat a boxer*.

DING! End of Round 8.  The crowd is on its feet after a last-second exchange.  I've gotten my eight-count back, and they can smell history.  The champ is frustrated, his head down as he listens to strategy.  I dare not get too confident; one uppercut could change the fight.  But it could also change the world.

There would be no bell for Round 9.  I didn't need one.  Once I had broken down his confidence, his stare, and his swagger, all that was left was to break down a man.  One-two and an uppercut!  That was all!  A shattered man lay on the canvas.

ALL HAIL THE NEW CHAMPION!!!
