Three.  And it's only Monday.  I can't keep saying I don't know all week, can I?  At least Carolyn told people to give me time to decide -- they all knew about the accident and about Brian's behavior.  As I got home trying to focus on homework, none of it made sense.  I told myself after the weekend that I'd know when the right person asked, but... there was no right person.  It all seemed so artificial.  What was I waiting for?

"Can I answer that?"

My eyes darted around, expecting to see Stefani's translucent image next to me, but nothing.  "No no, now's not a good time.  Just listen to me."

I sighed as I sat back at my computer to pay attention.  "Okay, good.  It's like this: are you expecting to find the right guy doing this?  It's just not the way it happens.  I know you went alone last year... you may want to do it again this year.  Or at least go as a friend with someone.  No one would blame us."

I was listening, but all I could think of is that there was some... I dunno, expectation for me?  "I thought that for a while.  Why do you think I stayed with Brian?"  That jarred me out of my confusion and into full attention.  "Thought that would work.  Look, the night can be magical or special or whatever.  It felt like the beginning of something.  And then the longer it went, the more I felt committed to it.  You don't want to admit months were wasted, do you?  So here's the deal: don't put expectations on this night.  Now, you gonna finish your physics homework?"

I was having trouble sleeping at this point.  The lights were out, the covers were up, and it meant nothing.  I just stared ahead, thinking about the people who had asked, and to each one I said "I don't know".  I must have sounded like I was blowing them off.

"Okay, did you take in anything I said?"  I rolled over and saw a silhouette.  It had to be Stefani.  "Yeah, I know, it may not hit right away.  But listen, you don't need to be concerned.  This decision isn't going to affect anything in the long run."

"...you sure?"

"Yes!"

"It would for me."

"...okay, what?  It's just a social event.  Why are you acting like you're giving someone a lottery ticket?"

"Stef, um... do you have any idea what I thought of you?"

"Yeah, you and half our class.  But that's why I'm saying you're trying too hard."

"...more than that.  I hated Brian before you did.  I just stared and wished and then when the time came I was too intimidated, but... damn.  I kinda wish I had said something.  Anything.  Just... taken my chance, but I didn't want to hear no."

"Like I said, a lot of the boys would take a chance.  You're sensing that now.  I mean, what were you going to do, run up to Brian and demand he leave me so you could have me?"

Stefani had to giggle at the image, so I continued.  "You!  Break up with her!  I love her, it's my turn, I'm the star of this movie!  Seriously, do you see what that sounds like?"

"Y-you know what the silly part is?  There might have been a time I'd have appreciated that.  You know what he did."

"Well, by that time you were set on your own.  I don't know.  It's all so weird.  Nothing feels right.  You saw who asked -- got any favorites?"

"Sorry, not my decision.  Maybe ask Carolyn what she thinks."

I quickly sat up in bed.  "There's an idea."

"What is?  Wait, no, you don't think... well... I mean... we could go in her group, sure."

"...yeah, that's, uh, totally what I meant."

"Pete -- you're not you anymore.  What are you planning?"

"Well... doesn't Carolyn joke about how she's a little bi?"

"...joke, right?"

"You think so?"

"Well, it doesn't matter, Petey.  I'm not."

"Not your decision, remember?  Listen... I know it's weird, but I like who I like, right?  My mind is still male.  And... if anyone would understand why we'd need to see what the other side is like, she would.  She's not going with anyone either right now.  Why not call her bluff?"

"...your funeral tomorrow.  I like having her as a friend.  You screw it up, I'm kicking you out of my body and MAKING you go to Heaven.  Got it?"

"As if you could."

"Pete, I'm serious!  Do you think she'd love it?  You're taking a heck of a risk here."

I closed my eyes as I felt her get back into my brain.  "Why not?  Everyone else is."
