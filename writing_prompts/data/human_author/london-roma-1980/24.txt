Alan, Gary, and Mac approached the coffin.  Wreaths lay on either side.  A uniformed guard stood watch near the dead man's feet.  A photograph accompanied the layout -- one of a younger man, in his dress uniform, his eyes still showing optimism before deployment.

"...he loved what we did," Gary finally said to the other two.  "We brought him some comfort knowing we could be human."

"If he wanted to be human he could've gotten out like we did," Mac snarled.  "Got our bosses to keep us safe."

Alan shot a glare at Mac.  "Hey, we were lucky.  The whole thing was messed up.  I'm sure he thought he was doing what he had to do.  Still, the boys over there coulda used a few doctors."

"Just because you got to show conscientious objection doesn't mean it was for everyone.  Somebody had to go to the front lines."  Gary felt trapped between two cynics, and not for the first time.  "We failed him when he got back.  I was offering as much as I could from my salary, but doctors wouldn't talk to him and people spat on him when he came back."

"Hey, we offered him a place on our show, but the guy showed up strung out."  Alan wasn't too happy at being labeled part of the problem.  "Whatever he did over there, it stuck with him.  You don't come back from that.  No wonder the guy had a hole in his brain."

"Well, you know what they say: suicide is painless," Mac smirked.  He never thought he'd be the one to reference that from their old days.  "We did what we could.  Some guys just can't take help to save their lives."

"Guys, enough!"  Gary practically tried to drag both men back to their seats, jolting them back to reality.  "Don't you get it?  While we were busy clowning around he killed his soul for us!  It doesn't matter what you think about why he was there.  He went there, we didn't, and then we left him as a punchline!"  Tears were forming in Gary's eyes.  "We made light of hell.  He lived it."

Alan sobered up fast.  "He's right, Mac.  And we should know that.  Stuff we showed wasn't pretty.  I'm sorry, Gary -- I guess I'm just coping with it.  Survivor's guilt or whatever the doc would say.  I hated it, I got out of it, and I forgot why it was what I hated."  Alan hugged Gary.  "He was your friend.  I can't forget that."

Mac bowed his head and placed his hand on the coffin.  "Goodbye," he said.

"Farewell," Alan added as he quickly crossed himself.

Gary lingered for an extra second, finally whispering the word "Amen."
