*Scene(s): both sides of a videoconference.*

CRYSTAL-2: "Hi!  How goes the effort to find our world?"

DR. HART: "Well, I'm sorry to say it's a difficult one.  Most universes are extremely isolated like ours.  We've never gotten anyone back who has disappeared.  I can't speak for visitors, as I've been in this field for only about a dozen years and you're the first I've met."

CRYSTAL-1: "Oh... but, uh, if you found it, we could travel to it easily, right?"

DR. HART: "Potentially.  An intentional intersect has never been tried before, and I would worry about triggering Class 10.  It would all be experimental."

CRYSTAL-2: "Which means if it does happen, it's basically..."

DR. HART: "We'd be sending the person who needs to go there home, and they'd have a funny story to tell their family.  I mean, I understood that was the idea."

CRYSTAL-1: "Well, uh... I mean..."

CRYSTAL-2: "It would be nice to remain friends."

DR. HART: "Just to remind you, what you're thinking about is so far as we know impossible.  Intersects are understood, but they've all been natural phenomena.  While the how of such an event has been examined and reported, we're still not sure why.  Until we answer that, there's a lot of luck involved."

CRYSTAL-2: "So we're all stuck here?"

CRYSTAL-1: "But... but the children..."

DR. HART: "Not to sound too callous, but you would hardly be the first parents who through no fault of their own left children behind.  A strong family system should be a great help."

CRYSTAL-1: "Well, his sister did talk about wanting kids..."

CRYSTAL-2: "You'd send them to live in *America*?"

CRYSTAL-1: "What does that mean?"

CRYSTAL-2: "I mean... it's... wouldn't they get shot?"

DR. HART: "For the record, both of you -- I have spent time in the US as part of my doctoral research.  I'm certain that your children will have a good life there; it's not like the continent is in Greece-level economic shape."

CRYSTAL-2: "But... but... you sure?"

CRYSTAL-1: "Don't you trust our sister-in-law?"

CRYSTAL-2: "...I guess, but Britain's the only home they've known and they deserve to grow up there!"

CRYSTAL-1: "And two of us deserve to be with them.  We can make this right.  Can't we, Doctor?  I mean, right now there's a Leo and a Daisy who are very confused and scared."

DR. HART: "I can assure you, we are doing the best we can."

*Meanwhile, in another room.*

ANDY-1: "So the blood work came back."

ANDY-2: "Okay... what do we know?"

ANDY-1: "Well, I doubt our wives know yet, but we can... here, look."

*Andy-2 reads it.*

ANDY-2: "I was afraid of that."

ANDY-1: "Don't worry; we'll find a way to get you back home to your family.  I trust our science.  If you got here, you can get back."

ANDY-2: "...it's not that.  I guess I always suspected I was the visitor because... honestly, this reality is better for us, and if I could I'd bring the kids here."

ANDY-1: "What are you talking about?  There was very little difference in the answers we gave."

ANDY-2: "They didn't ask a lot about politics.  But remember how I made a mistake?"

ANDY-1: "What of it?  It was only a month ago, and you know, [it kind of got lost in the news cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_and_state_funeral_of_Elizabeth_II).  Easy mistake to make."

ANDY-2: "Listen... Crystal doesn't know this, but I have government connections.  Johnson's not just our Prime Minister, he has incredible power and popularity.  There's a nationalist, xenophobic movement throughout.  I don't think I'm safe if I go back."

ANDY-1: "...you have citizenship.  We became duals [when we got married](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_nationality_law), remember?"

ANDY-2: "Times are changing.  Isolation is growing."

ANDY-1: "How bad could it be?"

*At the Bohr Institute.*

DR. STONE: "Dr. Hart -- we have contact with the home universe."

DR. HART: "We do?  But how?"

DR. STONE: "It appears the doubles come from a universe where research into this phenomenon far surpasses ours.  They are capable of Class 1 intersects -- just the kind that would return status to normal."

DR. HART: "Good news.  Maybe they'll share the technology while they're at it."

DR. STONE: "I don't think that's going to happen.  We received a message... It says: 'We are aware of a universal disturbance that has resulted in a fugitive and kidnapping victim arriving with you.  Find them and return them immediately.  Signed, Supreme Minister Boris Johnson, Empire of Britain.'"

DR. HART: "Get in contact with them immediately.  We have a lot to learn about this home universe."
