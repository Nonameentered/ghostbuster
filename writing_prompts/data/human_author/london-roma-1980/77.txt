(PART 5)

You didn't have to tell us what our copies were told.  They got into our outfits, were sent to our homes, and were to live our lives.  Jenny's double would politely refuse any more dates with mine or anyone else's, going on with her studies, her cheerleading, and her obedience.  Mine would return to my friends in chess club and math team, do my college essays, and probably use any scholarship I earned.  To the rest of the world -- even to my parents and siblings -- nothing happened but a date that didn't go anywhere.

A thousand thoughts went through my mind as Jenny and I stood and waited together.  Some were about how I should've never had a crush on her.  Some were about how I had to find a way to warn Mom and Dad that they were going to see a fake.  Some, I admit, were about what Jenny and I could or would do if we were left to be independent.  But most circled around my own voice in my head: I am to wait.  I am to receive a consequence.  I am to be still.

Eventually, the door opened and the stepmother viewed both of us with disdain.  It was as if we were lab rats to her, not people -- certainly not her stepdaughter and a boyfriend.  "Now your lives will be much better," she told us as we stared blankly in her direction.  "You will be model children.  But as for the evidence... you are to both follow me."  She walked away and we followed, incapable of making a break for it no matter how much we wanted.

*I'm sorry, Jenny,* I thought.  *I'm so sorry this is happening to you.  If only I'd known this about your life I would've let you off earlier.  I would have attacked her, told you to run, anything.  It's not even about me now; I'm sorry I failed you.*

She stopped in the kitchen, causing us to stop behind her like toy soldiers.  She handed each of us a cup of green liquid.  "Both of you, you are to drink all of this."  I lifted the liquid to my lips, ignoring the unusual color and even more unusual taste as I chugged every drop I could.  When I was done, I instinctively handed the empty cup back to her.  The stepmother smiled as Jenny did the same thing; she then continued with, "You are to both follow me again," as she headed out the back door.

We found ourselves in a dark backyard.  We walked through an area devoid of everything but garden, grass, and fence, feeling the dew and bugs on our feet but ignoring it and watching how far she'd have us go.  I wanted to will my hand to reach out and take Jenny's, but my mind was too intent on walking forward, following our master.  I could only hope she felt like I did even after all we'd been through.

Finally, she stopped us both.  "Jennifer, you are to stand here and face me," she commanded.  Jenny obliged, walking mindlessly to the spot she pointed to and looking back at the home she used to have.  "Boy... you are to stand here and face me."  I walked to where her finger indicated and turned around, looking at her as she was already headed to the house.  We couldn't follow her or escape; we were to stand.

Suddenly, I felt my stomach churning and my muscles spasming.  I wanted to double over, but my body didn't react.  My feet felt like they were sinking into the grass, through the ground.  My arms raised up over my head as I felt my hair stiffen upward and extend greatly.  My breathing became labored.  I looked around in panic, hoping to find some indication as to how I could get rid of this horrible feeling.

As I did, I saw Jenny, and it became clear what was happening.  Her body, like mine, was rounding out, with her legs seemingly fusing and her shoulders expanding.  Her feet had in fact sunk into the ground.  Her arms and hair were going upward like mine, but they were also turning colors.  Then I saw a brownish shell form on her skin, while green buds quickly formed and expanded on her arms and hair.

My feet were sending signals to my body of water and other things traveling in my body.  My legs and torso were quickly being covered.  I looked over at Jenny and saw her looking back at me.  With all of my effort, I managed to mouth the words I love you to her, and saw her mouth them back.

At that moment, I watched as the bark covered her neck and face.  I felt leaves forming in my hair and on my fingers and arms, which were now indistinguishable.  Everything covered my mouth, then my eyes.  Within a few minutes, I felt the intensity so strongly I blacked out.  But I knew... tomorrow the neighbors would notice two new trees in the stepmother's backyard.  Two beautiful additions to an otherwise sparse lawn and garden.

**25 years later**

Jennifer looked through all the unusual decorations in the living room.  Her husband, Brian, shook her head.  "Your mom's estate sure has a lot of knick-knacks," he noted.

"Yeah," she agreed.  "She was a real eccentric.  I'm not sorry she's gone, though -- it's a relief to have a real family now.  But at least we can sell some of these and hope for the best."

"No need to be so detached," Brian chastised her.  "She was always nice when we were together."

"Yeah, because I was an adult.  Being a kid was no picnic with her, let me tell you."

As they inventoried and studied everything, Jennifer's daughter Kathleen, a 16-year-old high schooler, rushed to the backyard.  She had brought her boyfriend Charles with her, and the two explored the outside.  "Well," Kathleen said first, "there's basically nothing here.  That's weird."

"Well, it is a nice garden," Charles noted.  "And those trees should provide some shade.  Wanna go sit under them?"

"Sure," Kathleen said with a smile.  The two walked, holding hands, and sat between two trees in the middle of a backyard.  Kathleen looked up and smiled at Charles.  The teen didn't want to tell anyone, but she didn't miss Grandma for a minute.  The visits were fun, but the only time she was comfortable there was sitting under these trees.

As she explained all this to Charles, she felt a sense of home she never had before in this backyard.  It was comforting; it was welcoming; it was almost like love emanated from her surroundings.  She and Charles rested in each other's arms together, shaded by what would have been her mother and could have been her father.  Kathleen could not explain this urge to want to live in this house when she became an adult, but she knew she would ask her mother if she could.

"Kathleen!  Charles!"  Jennifer called from inside the house.  "Would you two come in for lunch?"

Kathleen thought of standing up, but looked at her boyfriend and had a better idea.  "Can't we eat outside?  It's beautiful under these trees!"
