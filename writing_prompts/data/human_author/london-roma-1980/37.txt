It had been five weeks of my life since I lost it.  Within those five weeks, I had to re-learn everything I knew about my life.  Even something as simple as the question "are you left-handed" suddenly made me pause.  It would have been nice if Stefani could just take over during those times like she did with family or with the therapist, but rules were rules: her life was my life.

I had finally gotten the last part of my application off to State U.  Dinner on this Saturday night was incredible, and it left me with plenty of time back outside -- where I'd taken to being alone -- to try and sort out the gameplan going forward.  I was seriously hoping to tell Stef to let me take over more, maybe for the family events, but before I could ask her, she appeared again next to me -- invisible to all but me, as always.

"So," she said.  "You like your new social circle?"

Not the question I was expecting at this time, but sure.  "Yeah, they're pretty nice to me.  It looks like people get it was an accident and I'm okay."

"Well, get used to a plot twist.  You know the Homecoming dance is in three weeks, right?"

A quick check of our internal calendar in my mind confirmed that.  "Yeah?"

"This was never one of my favorite times.  I imagine you're going to get a few questions in the next few days.  And it doesn't matter how you answer them; someone's going to be disappointed."

"Questions?  What sort of..." Oh, THOSE questions.  "Okay... I get ya.  So, before we go any further, who are you hoping for?"

Stef scratched her head for a while before a smirk came across her face.  "Well, that's the thing: I don't think they'll let me choose."

"They?"

"You don't seriously think this arrangement was MY idea, do you?  I told you, Heaven didn't want me because I was supposed to live and Hell said no because I did nothing wrong.  This got cooked up.  So, yeah, *they* figure that this is the best punishment -- it's your call."

"Well... okay then.  I mean I can think of a few I'd like to go to the dance with.  Maybe we'll get lucky and they'll ask."

"Oh, like Carolyn, I'm sure."

"How did you... I mean, what's wrong with that?"

"She'd say no in a heartbeat to me.  And she'd think it weird I even asked."

"But I'm... aw, man, you're right.  I keep wanting to do things with this new lease on life I got and... it's not working out."

"Yeah... I keep telling you, you're me now.  I don't know why you can't remember that."

"Stef... please.  Does this mean I have to be you and not me, forever?  Isn't there something I can do to be me?"

"Your body's six feet under, Pete; it wouldn't do any good."

"No, I mean... can I make decisions around here?"

"Oh, yeah, sure!  But your decisions... I mean, you have a different mind, different upbringing, different everything.  We can't just have you snap your fingers and you're a my mom's son instead of her daughter.  That's why I don't mind being here.  There are things you need to get used to.  I can help."

"So... wait, you -- we -- like, have you ever had a real boyfriend?"  I started thinking, digging through her memory.  And then I found the answer.  "Brian??  Him?"

"Shh!  You'll get Mom's attention.  Besides, I'm kinda not proud of it.  He transferred; let's leave it at that, okay?  Don't look further into that until I say you can."

"But... everyone knows what kind of a weirdo he was.  I mean, he was the one leading that whole murderer thing; I'm glad he's gone too, but that's that, right?"

Stefani seemed to shudder.  "You know how I try to keep you from some of my memories?"

"Yeah... you say it's best to approach this gradually."

"I guess this'll be the first real dating thing since and... you kind of need to know."

"Know what?"

"Brian didn't get kicked out because of what he said to you; that was just the last straw.  Let me let you see."

In a flash, I was reliving her memories from junior year.  Of being asked to Homecoming a year ago; of the dance going smoothly; of their first kiss; of exchanging Christmas gifts... and of conversations.  Sure, she said all the right things, but I began to hear snippets in my head of Brian... not responding right.  Not being as comforting.  Heck, there were times I was nicer to her than he was, and we never met!

"Stef?  He wasn't a good boyfriend, was he?"

"That's just the half of it.  Now, hold on tight.  This part can get... a bit bumpy."
