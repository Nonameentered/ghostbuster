The last sentence really caps this, words!  I give this the unofficial ROD SERLING AWARD OF THE WEEK! (applause)

I understand structure of the story and all, but I think there were a couple of places where paragraph breaks weren't necessary.  "house on the hill.  But a few feet away..." strikes me as one.  It's a little thing, but crit is hard to find with such an idea.  

And as someone deemed an "essential worker" while reading all those people saying you HAD to work from home, oh this hit hard.

Well done!
