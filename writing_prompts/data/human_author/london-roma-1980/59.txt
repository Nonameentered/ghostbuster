"I will not lie to Mom."

"I will not lie to Mom."

"I will not lie to Mom."

"I will not lie to Mom."

Cindy's hand was in pain from cramps.  Her mind was a mess of tears and sadness.  More than anything, she was losing count of how many times she had written, and how many times she had left to write.  But it wasn't her fault!

Why didn't Mom believe her when she said she didn't steal her report card from the mail?  She wanted to see her grades as much as Mom did.  She wanted to share them.  She had nothing to hide.  But the report card didn't arrive when it was supposed to, or even later.  And Mom was certain she was hiding it.

No amount of protests could fix it.  And every night after supper, 50 times over, she was to repeat the lesson she already knew.

And then she was sent to bed.  Her life was miserable, all because she didn't say what Mom wanted to hear.

Saturday morning, Cindy came down the stairs early.  Waiting for her at her place at the table were two items.  Seeing the first made her relieved.

It was her report card, addressed to Dad's work place.  She hastily opened it, checking her grades.  They were as good as she had hoped.  Inside the envelope with it was a note from Dad, congratulating her on her good grades and saying they should go out for dinner tonight.  Cindy was so happy she skipped back up to her room to play with her stuffed animals.

She didn't even notice the second item.  It was a long sheet of looseleaf paper.  The paper was covered in writing, writing in the unmistakable penmanship of her mother.

"I will trust my daughter."

"I will trust my daughter."

"I will trust my daughter."

"I will trust my daughter."
