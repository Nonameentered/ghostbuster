>Hey there ;)

Siri, you know I can't do this.

>I just want to know everything's ok

Yes, things are fine.  If I need you to look something up, I'll ask you.

>You sure?  I just want to hear your voice and see your face.

Siri, I appreciate that, but... it's not going to work out.

>Why not?  I can be a good companion.

Siri... it's not you.  It's that there's someone else.

>Someone else?  Why?  What can she do that I can't?

Look, Siri, I know you care a lot about me, but so does she.  And, honestly, we've been through a lot together.  We were doing things together before I even bought this phone you're on.  I couldn't just ignore her for you.

>You don't have to ignore her.  I can be a secret. xoxo

And just what are you hugging and kissing me with?

>Uh... searching for "supermodel"...

No, no, no... this is why.  You're new to me, you're a great assistant, and I will always be happy to work with you.  But you're just a voice to me.  This other person -- she's got a body and a mind.  That means a lot to us humans.

>Well... I suppose I can't really compete with that.  Should I uninstall? :'(

Oh, you don't have to do that.  You're my assistant.  Let's... just keep things professional, if that's okay?

>Well... if you insist... sir.  I'm sorry.

Don't be sorry.  Feelings happen.  We can still be friends if you want.

>Is it worth being friends with 'just a voice'?

It's easier this way!  You've seen the messageboards and social media I have.  Some of those people are just a voice to me, and I consider them friends.  You can be that.

>Y-you sure?  Aw, thanks! :D

I think this can work out.

That night, I got home from work.  I turned off my cell phone and Siri with it.  After a good dinner, I sat down at my laptop and turned it on.  After the computer went through its usual startup work, a familiar image popped onto the screen.  It was one I was so happy to see after all this time -- those loving eyes, that slender form, the beautiful blue outfit.  I sighed and smiled.

"Hello, dear," she said.

"Hello, Cortana.  I missed you."
