**One week later**

Stefani told me that when things were tough, a walk in nature was the best way to clear the head.  One college application essay too many and I took her advice.  I made my way to a meadow, with grass as far as I could see.  I walked slowly, looking up at the sky as the clouds floated by.  All the human problems seemed to fade away... leaving just the problem unique to me.

"Isn't it great?" Stefani manifested sitting down in the field.  "Away from everyone, away from trouble... I should've told you about this earlier."

"I'm not sure I would have appreciated that."

"Do you now, Petey?"

"...yeah.  Yes, I do.  It's relaxing."

She stood up to run through.  "C'mon, let's go!"

I tried following her, but the open-toed sandals I was in made a little difficult to run -- especially since my opponent here didn't have the burden of actual weight or anything else.  "Wait up!"

"Kick off the shoes!"

I did as she told me and was more easily able to follow.  She twirled and gazed high into the sky like Julie Andrews in the Sound of Music, waiting for me to catch up to her.  A smile beamed off of her face as she felt like she was in another world, one without the difficulties, one where she wasn't burdened by guilt.  I'd seen her laugh and I'd seen her smile, but this felt like a completely different emotion out of her.

I finally ran to and through her form, tumbling down and spinning to five feet away down the hill.  We shared a laugh only we knew about as she waited for me to pull myself up.  I lay down in the field by the side of the hill in the meadow, just staring at the clouds, and within a few minutes she did the same so I could see her.

"Isn't it great?  Just running through the world... the wind in your hair... the grass between your toes... we should do this more often."

"I guess we should..."

"Wait -- you're telling me you don't like doing this?"  I saw her prop her spiritual self up on her elbow so she could give me a dirty look.  "C'mon -- how could you not?"

"Well, it's not that, it's just... I haven't done it in... gee..."

"In what?  In how long?"

"...I'm trying to remember.  I must have been, like, ten or something.  I just... stopped doing it."

"...you're kidding.  Why?  It's a great feeling."

"Stef... I guess this sounds weird, but it's such a girl thing to do.  I mean, not to run through fields or something like that but... to be barefoot at all.  I... I guess what I'm trying to say is... well..."

"...what?  You were self-conscious of them?"

"...a lot, yeah.  Just how I was.  And not just the feet -- a lot about my old body.  Like, basically all of it."

"Do you think I wasn't?"

"It's not the same.  You women have to worry about being reduced to pretty, to being objectified.  Men?  Men are just... no.  All function, no form."

Stefani began reaching for my hair as if to get me to face her.  "Okay, first thing: you're one of us now, remember?  Second, too many men sell themselves short, and you know why?  You're basing beauty on what makes US look good, not what makes YOU look good.  But you'll figure it out soon enough, I'm sure.  Now, enough self-loathing for one day.  We're here to forget, right?"

I sat up and stared into the distance.  Somewhere out there was my new home, my new family, and my new responsibilities.  If I looked hard enough, I might be able to see them.  But we were in a different part of the county -- there was no way to see my old home, family, and life.  Maybe she had a point.  I wasn't doing well with one, and I couldn't go back to the other.  But for now, neither one existed.

"Yeah... let's see where we can go."  I stood up and waited for her to do the same.  Together we walked along the grass in the middle of nowhere.  And in that moment, I remembered what I had forgotten in the intervening years since the last time I did this.  Grass under shoes wasn't special; grass under feet felt *perfect*.
