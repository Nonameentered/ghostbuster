CRYSTAL-1: "You have to leave.  They'll find you.  We have family in America, you can stay there."

CRYSTAL-2: "I'm NOT going there!  Ew!"

ANDY-1: "Hey!  We're from America!"

CRYSTAL-2: "Yeah, but you're one of the good ones."

ANDY-2: "Hold up.  There's no need to go anywhere.  The Empire has no idea where we are, and we're sending them on a wild goose chase.  Dr. Hart has been very helpful at stonewalling."

CRYSTAL-1: "But if they come after us..."

ANDY-1: "Reality check here.  They're communicating with people in Denmark.  We're in England.  They will search that lab and its vicinity six ways from Sunday and find nothing.  Even if they came through, we'd have a head start of days, maybe weeks."

ANDY-2: "And they can't get through.  They are working on the technology, but it will take a long time to get it together.  I looked at their progress work before we were sent here.  It's all prototypes and plans.  Unless they strongarm the scientists over here into building something similar, we're safe."

CRYSTAL-1: "...you...you sure?"

ANDY-2: "Sure.  They have nothing."

ANDY-1: "What about the other Dr. Hart?"

ANDY-2: "I told him exactly where the old Embassy was.  If my calculations are correct, that place has been shut down and the Empire is trying to get its secrets out.  UFA officials took as much as they could, but I'm sure there are other secrets.  Maybe there will be some the Resistance can use."

ANDY-1: "Aren't you sending him into the lion's den?  They'll look there."

CRYSTAL-2: "Oh no, honey, you didn't..."

ANDY-2: "Relax, everyone.  There's still UFA people hiding in there.  They will join the Resistance and help him with their information.  We have government secrets, military plans, scientific advancement news... remember, up until a week or so ago, the UFA and Empire were allies.  It was the Annexation that changed everything."

CRYSTAL-1: "What does he mean?"

ANDY-1: "It appears he means that Hart-2 has friends in helping him get more tech to the Resistance.  At this point, he and Stone-2 are likely racing to build that portal.  One of them wants to send people to freedom.  The other wants to send people to punishment."

CRYSTAL-2: "We can't let them win."

ANDY-1: "And that's why you two are staying here and laying low.  If anyone suspects that you're here, it will be a media frenzy.  The tabloids will never shut up about it.  And they will find us."

*A long pause.*

ANDY-1: "But... you are our guests.  And we will do what we can to take your mind off of this trouble."

CRYSTAL-1: "Would you like some tea?  Snacks?  Video games?"
