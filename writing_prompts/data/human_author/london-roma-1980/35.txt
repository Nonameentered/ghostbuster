The dark.  It's back.  Now is my time.  Time to head outside and begin the hunt.  Those little creatures won't know what hit them, especially the ones that think they can leave through the air.  I am the great hunter.  It is time to strike.

Wait, what?  I don't get it.  This is the dark, this is MY time.  What's with all these twolegs around here?  How am I supposed to get anything done when there's so much noise?  The hunt requires silence!

Actually, come to think of it, these aren't the twolegs I remember.  That one -- a blanket for fur?  What a silly -- everyone knows blankets are for snuggling indoors, not for hiding under when you're outdoors!  And this one... I thought that twolegs would have pink or black skin under their fur.  Never seen one with green skin before.

What are they doing, anyway?  Just going from place to place for no reason?  I'm... confused.  Wait, the one inside... is just... giving them stuff?  This is a disgrace to the hunt!  I must put a stop to it!  You -- you, the twoleg with green skin!  Don't you know that you'll never learn to be a great hunter like that?  I demand that you... okay, scratch my ears, you got me.  Carry on.

Huh -- what are those noises coming from that place over there?  Yikes!  Is that a sky bomb in the air... just over that one place... making the crash noise?  Something is very wrong with them.  Approach with caution... slowly... slowly... that other noise.  I know it.  It's the sound of bigsnouts declaring they are on the prowl!  Better get the claws at the ready.  You never know when they'll be needed.

Approach slowly.  If the twolegs are in a generous mood, there will be something I can hunt in there.  The little creatures are drawn to twoleg items.  All I have to do is sneak up, search the dark, and all will be... what the...

BIGSNOUT!  I'M SPOTTED!  RUN!  I don't want to die tonight, please go away.  What do I do?  Okay, climbing post, great, here we go.  Whew.  At a safe place -- ha ha, bigsnout, you can't catch me now!  Yeah, yell all you want, you yellow-furred abomination.  It won't do you any... good...

...wait, now what do I do?  It's a long way down.  Am I... stuck here?  HELP!  SOMEONE!  THE HUNTER IS NOW THE HAUNTED!  What do I do now?

"Wow, the sounds from this house are so authentic.  You hear the black cat noise in the tree?"

No, you stupid twoleg, I AM in the tree!  Why won't you... oh no.  This could be a long night.
