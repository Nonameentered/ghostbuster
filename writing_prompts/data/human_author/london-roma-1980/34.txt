The Soviet soldiers stared at each other.  None of this made sense.  An enemy combatant was coming right at them, through the field of battle, with no armor or shield.  He should have been an easy target.  The commandant was even joking about how he was clearly a stupid American -- the red and blue gave it away.

But here they stood, without a single bullet left in their AKs, and it kept approaching.

"Clips empty," muttered Fyodor.  "Is still not dead!"

"How?" replied an incredulous Vladimir.  "This is just human, is it not?  He must bleed, he must die!  For Mother Russia!"

Vladimir got out of the foxhole and charged the opponent.  He pulled out his combat knife, serrated and ready for delivering the glory of Mother Russia.  With all the fury he could muster, he stabbed the foe right at heart level.

Nothing.

Vladimir pulled his knife away, only to discover it mangled, twisted, frayed, and useless.  He stared upward in disbelief.  How is this possible?  The best the Party had to offer and it crumbled like a child's toy?

Fyodor looked back at his commandant, awaiting a signal.  The commandant nodded, and Fyodor charged out to help his comrade.  He turned his AK around, the butt end now facing forward.  With all his might, Fyodor wound up and swung the weapon at his foe, hoping to cave him in with the hammer blow.

But the foe didn't flinch, and when Fyodor looked down upon his former gun, it was in a thousand pieces.

Suddenly, the enemy took both men by the wrists.  Flying quickly out of the Hungarian battle zone they found themselves in, he took them skyward, sending them straight to Moscow in no time flat.  There, he deposited both men just outside St. Peter's, as if to warn them to stay in their own land.

Fyodor and Vladimir could only watch in awe and horror as this man -- or this supposed man -- glared them down.  The blue outfit stood out in contrast to the red around them, and as he left them -- somehow flying without an airplane -- they both knew they'd never forget that "S" symbol on it.  The Americans had developed the greatest soldier of them all.

Would Khrushchev believe it?
