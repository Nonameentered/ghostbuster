I really like the tone of this story.  It nails wholesome well, and includes a little supernatural in it.  The idea of the person being selfless even on death's door is a stock character, but one so lacking in the real world the presence here is welcome.

I do notice that you flip-flop from past to present tense a bit in this story, which a copyeditor would be infuriated by but which I can work my way around.  There is, however, one omission:

>He decided to tell me, thinking I wouldn't say anything since we close.

The right phrasing here is "since we \_were\_ close" or "since we \_are\_ close".  Close, in this sentence, is an adjective not a verb, meaning the subordinate clause is missing the verb it needs to finish the thought.  Never accidentally a verb, as Murphy's Law would say.

Still, a good take on the topic!  I like it!
