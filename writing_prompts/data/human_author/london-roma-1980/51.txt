*Scene: the lab.  All six of our Earth-1 characters are there.*

HART-1: "All right.  In a few moments, I anticipate that we will receive the call from Earth-2.  They will initiate contact through our co-ordinates, after which the exchange will take place."

STONE-1: "What's important is that we cannot send anyone through on our own.  This is a secondary gate, not a primary one.  They must hold this... door open for anyone to go through it."

ANDY-2: "Which will help our plan."

STONE-1: "That's the idea.  Stone-2 will have to hold the door open on her own.  When she does, I will grab her and pull her the rest of the way through.  She'll be trapped on this side so that we can begin negotiations."

CRYSTAL-2: "...well... I guess this is goodbye."

CRYSTAL-1: "Why?  We're getting your children.  We're bringing you to safety."

*The radio begins to crackle.  Stone-2's voice can be heard.  Hart-1 takes a position so he can communicate and view the other side.*

STONE-2: "This is an official transmission from the Empire!  We demand response!"

HART-1: "Alt-Bohr Station, acknowledging.  We are prepared for connection."

*Stone-1 slides to the side of the door, hiding from view.*

STONE-2: "As you should be.  Commencing connection.  We expect the fugitive and victim to walk through without incident."

*The powdery pillar inside the cylinder that is the power source begins to glow brightly.  A whirring sound is heard as lights on the side of the door begin to light up, meeting at the top.  When they do, the area inside the door frame turns into a psychedelic pattern.*

CRYSTAL-1: "What's that?"

ANDY-1: "Probably the wormhole connecting both of us.  I'll explain later."

*Hart-1 views the screen and sees two guards enter behind Stone-2.  They each grab a leg of hers to anchor her as she leans forward through the door.  Stone-1 tries to grab Stone-2 by the hair to get her through, but Stone-2 doesn't budge!  Stone-1 hesitates in confusion, and Stone-2 grabs Stone-1's wrists with each hand.*

STONE-2: "Now!"

*Hart-1 watches the guards pull, yanking both Stones towards the door!  Hart-1 gets up and grabs Stone-1, trying to pull her back.  It seems like a futile effort, as both scientists are losing their footing and slipping into the portal... but Stone-1 begins thrashing about, and suddenly, everyone falls backwards with the grip being broken!*

HART-1: "Are you all right?"

*Stone-1 sits up and spits out a tooth before leaving the room to rinse her mouth out.  The radio crackles again.*

STONE-2: "What did you think you were doing!?  I said no resistance!"

HART-1: "You had the wrong person.  I was trying to make sure she stayed where she belonged."

STONE-2: "And I was making sure SHE paid for her trickery!  A loyal citizen tipped off what you were attempting to do.  She will receive her reward soon enough."

ANDY-1: "Wait... that would be... you?"

CRYSTAL-2: "Well, I... uh..."

*Andy-2 mimics punching himself in the mouth.*
