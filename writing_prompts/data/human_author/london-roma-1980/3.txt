This story made me want to read it twice to catch all the hints.  Bravo!

I will say, though, just as a quickie: Stewie's first words are "purred"; then, later in the story, he "howled".  One is generally a cat action, the other a dog action.  Sure Stewie and Billie push something off a ledge (also a cat action), so I'm pretty sure that's what you meant -- and Woody's clearly a dog -- but it was a little confusing for a while.  Maybe I'm hung up on details.

Good work!
