The noble steed awaited the orders.

The enemy was bunkered down in a corner of the field, all according to plan.  Heavy losses had occurred on all sides -- just recently from the most powerful warrior, a cunning loss of life in a kamikaze move designed to allow for victory and glory.  As the horse tensed up beneath its rider, all plans were perfectly in place.  All that was left was the doing.

With a burst of speed, the pair charged.  They were alone, but they knew they were enough.  A forward movement brought them close to the correct position, but staring them down were enemies with spears, ready to add to the casualty list.  A sudden move sideways was required to evade one from the front, but both knew the enemies were still lethal, perhaps more so, from an angled attack.

The key charge followed once horse and rider were aligned perfectly.  To stop here would be death from spears; to go too far would put them in the way of a besieged tower and likely death from hot oil and gunfire.  Only this move could complete their glory.  Horse charged recklessly, ready to give all.  Rider noted the positions, ready with the signal.

And as they approached the correct location, the rider stopped his mount.  None could threaten them here.  None would separate them, dooming them together or apart.  But it was truth that in this location, they were stronger than any other soldier.  Through their combined effort, there was a perfect line of sight to the ultimate goal.  Their enemies could not block them; their victim could not escape.  A lowly cavalry man, through his own efforts, had risen to hero and ended the horrible conflict.
