The officer looks at the same image I did.  The blob on the screen is definitely headed our way.  But the officer doesn't seem too concerned.

"Relax, soldier," he tells me.  "It's probably a civilian aircraft."

"Sir," I say in hesitation.  "Did you not see the few screens before?  This used to be much more spread out.  It's like a fleet in tight formation.  I have no other explanation."

"A fleet... becoming a large blob..."  It was as if the officer's mind had wandered.  "No, it can't be..."  he turns to the person next to me.  "Corporal!  Get me a visual on a large unidentified craft at our 2:00!"

"Sir, yes, sir!"

I wait in anticipation and dread.  It is of little comfort that I detected no missiles headed our way.  Just a large... whatever the hell it is.

"Sir, visual confirmed!  Craft measures in the hundreds of feet.  Also, sir?  There appear to be five cockpits on the craft."

This snaps me out of my holding pattern.  I turn in shock to the corporal.  "Did... did you say five cockpits?  How is that possible?"

"I'm not sure either.  But look at the picture.  Here's the main steering area... but there's four others, here, here, here, and here.  And... well, am I crazy, or does the craft look... kinda human?"

He's not kidding.  The four other cockpits are practically hands and feet.  No wonder the dots became a blob -- as improbable as it sounded, five individual fighter jets looked to have linked up to make this monstrosity!

"It's true!"  The officer marches to the back and grabs the public address system to call to the war room.  "Red alert!  Supercraft of alien origin detected!  Commence Operation Voltron!"
