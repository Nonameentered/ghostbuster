*Crystal-1 sees that Andy-1 is a blubbering mess.  Andy-2 remains on the two-way, waiting for instructions from Hart-2.*

ANDY-1: "He... he's gone..."

CRYSTAL-1: "I'm sorry..."

*She hugs him as he continues bawling.*

ANDY-1: "It... why did this happen..."

CRYSTAL-1: "Don't think that way... he was a hero."

ANDY-1: "He was my friend."

CRYSTAL-1: "Shhh... it's okay... he did it for you."

ANDY-1: "...It... .didn't... have to..."

*Crystal-1 just hugs Andy-1.  On the two-way:*

HART-2: "Is that right?  Stone's gone?"

ANDY-2: "Yes.  It's really too complicated to explain, and I'll go over it later.  But that's what you need to know."

HART-2: "I hear some crying back there.  Is someone hurt?"

ANDY-2: "...well, that I guess can summarize: your counterpart in our world sacrificed himself to keep everyone here.  Stone's death was a by-product of his action."

HART-2: "Well... my condolences to all of you, and his actions are to be honored."

ANDY-2: "Yeah... but it still leaves open that as of now, I don't know if I'll see my family again... among other things."

HART-2: "Other things?"

ANDY-2: "Not the time for this.  Right now, we're still in the midst of recovering from the chaos."

HART-2: "Understood.  Unwinding from combat can be difficult.  I suppose there's no one here I can't speak to the other Hart anymore..."

ANDY-2: "Well, Stone is still alive."

HART-2: "Stone?  You said she died!"

ANDY-2: "Yours did.  Ours was our Hart's lab partner.  In fact, if she had her way, both Stones would be on this side of ol' [Stargate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate) here and we could have a hostage!"

HART-2: "Well, what went wrong?"

*Andy-2 looks over his shoulder.*

ANDY-2: "She can tell you another time.  Just relaying news.  Over and out."

*Andy-2 puts down the two-way radio and checks on Couple 1 as Andy-1 is using his and her shirts to clear his eyes.  Stone-1 and Crystal-2 return.*

STONE-1: "Well, I guess we'll have to dispose of this half-body.  Not much use hiding that Hart suffered an accident.  I'm sure authorities will be here in a while, and..."

*Andy-1 looks up at Crystal-2 standing by Stone-1.*

ANDY-1: "...YOU!"
