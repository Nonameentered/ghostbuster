I woke up behind the wheel after the collision.  It didn't seem like I got hit too hard, but the whiplash made me black out for a few minutes.  I examined the damage on the inside, then looked to see if I had any bleeding in the rear view mirror.  It was then that things took a turn for the surreal.

That wasn't my face looking back at me.  No real damage, mind you, nothing that would scar.  But the features had all changed.  I knew that long hair.  I knew the piercing brown eyes.  The skin tone and the dimples were unmistakable.  None of them were mine.  The face wasn't mine.

I looked at the steering wheel.  The hands weren't mine.

I did a quick inventory of where I was.  The car wasn't mine.

I looked down at the floor -- those shoes weren't mine.

I checked my whole body.  Some of those things definitely weren't mine.

"Okay, you're awake.  Can you hear me?"

I looked around.  There in the passenger seat was a familiar face, but there was a difference -- now she was translucent.  Everything was what I saw in me, but it seemed almost like an illusion.  There was so much going on that somehow this didn't even seem abnormal.

"What's going on?  Why are you over there and I'm here?"

"Oh, you can see me too?  Great.  Look, I'm so sorry this has happened. It's entirely my fault."

"Slow down, Stef, slow down.  What happened to me, and why do I look like you?"

Stef seemed to avoid eye contact as she spoke, perhaps out of guilt.  "All right... we have a few minutes before people arrive.  It's really complicated.  So... you know you were in a crash, right?"

"Yeah... but I should be in a different car."

"Okay... um... I'm so sorry.  This is all my fault.  I'm sorry I did this to you.  I... I lost control, and... and now this and..."

"Stefani, slow down.  Are we dead?"

"Well... that's the tricky part," she admitted, looking at my car in front of us and my body limp against the deflated air bag.  "You are.  Or, rather, the you you're used to is.  But since it's my fault, I made a wish as I saw it.  I asked the heavens to take me instead of you, because it's all my fault."

I sighed and leaned back in the driver's seat.  "And this is how they answered it."

"Pretty much.  So now I'm no longer living and you are, but your body was too beat up, so you have to live through me.  Basically, you're me now."

It took a minute or two of just trying to accept it before I replied.  "So you're off to Heaven or Hell?"

"I don't wanna go.  I put you in this mess, and I'm going to help you through it.  Heaven... well, I don't belong right now.  And Hell doesn't want me.  I didn't murder you, just... an accident.  So I'm stuck here with you."

I shook my head.  "Do you know how out of place this is?  I know very little about you.  I don't know your family, I don't know your classes..."

"Relax -- you have access to my mind.  You'll figure it out.  But... I'm going to stick around, and if you have any questions, I'll help you out.  I don't want to leave you hanging like this.  I've already made enough of a mess... people are coming, I gotta go."

"Wait!  Jump in control of you for a while.  Let me observe and learn."

Stefani was taken aback.  "Can I do that?  Let me try..."  She squinted to concentrate and reached into my/her chest.  I quickly felt her invade and travel up the spine to the brain.  I could sense myself being thrown to the back of the mind, as though in the back seat of the control panel.  I watched as Stefani burst into tears while police arrived.  I didn't know how long she'd wanted to cry, but I would let her, for now.

**That night**

Stefani slumped down on her bed, refusing to talk to her family for the time being.  She rested there, as if hoping to make the whole situation go away.  I felt myself return to control as Stefani's soul/ghost left and stood beside the bed.  I quickly looked up.

"Are you ready?" she asked me.

"I don't know... I guess you can't stay very long."

"I heard an angel tell me no more than a few hours a day, or it wouldn't be fair to you.  So I can do what I can, but you're going to have to be me more than I am.  But I'm not going to leave you alone.  We're in this together."

I rolled over on to my side.  "Well... do I have to talk out loud to talk to you?"

Stefani thought about it.  "I don't think you have to unless it's important.  But it's early, so it's best we do it this way for now."

"Won't your parents think it's weird I'm talking to myself?"

"I'll make sure they don't.  If we're in public, I'll be in the back seat.  I can still help you there, but it's more useful like this.  Look... get some rest.  We've had a long day."

"C-can I even show my face at school tomorrow?  We're going to be the most hated person at school."

"We'll find out tomorrow, I guess.  Listen... things are bad, I know.  We're both going to go through a lot.  But we can do this.  I trust you with me, don't I?"

"...yeah..."

"So let's get through this.  Just get ready for bed."

I rolled out of bed and looked for the toothbrush and soap I'd need to get ready.  I quickly paused when the exact method hit me.  "Uh... is it okay if I take a shower?"

Stefani laughed.  "I have nothing to hide from you anymore, Petey.  Heck, I was going to show you how to use tampons next.  I get it.  We're the same person now... let's get used to being that way."
