The chase was on, up the skyscraper, as the villain's mooks were trying to get me cornered.  Staircase after staircase they followed, and I kept racing up.  By the time I got to the roof, I was thoroughly exhausted, collapsing in a puddle of my own sweat.  Fortunately, I flowed over to the rooftop's A/C unit to resolidify myself before someone did something bad to me.

"There you are!  We got ya now!"  Oh, heck, did they take the elevator too?  "You got nowhere to run!"

Oh, that's what THEY think.  A quick scan of the New York skyline revealed another skyscraper, taller than this one, three blocks down.  It'll be tough to resist temptation, I thought, but it's the only way out.  I revved up my legs to a blur, ready to take off at full speed, and just before the bust out the gunfire, I took off for my destination through the skyline.

What I'm sure were some very confused mooks opened fire as I raced off on thin air, keeping my eyes locked on my destination building.  As long as I didn't look down, I was home free.  But there were no windows on the level I was heading for!  It wouldn't do any good to slam on the brakes and find a new destination -- I'd just have to get here the hard way.

I braced for impact, and within a split second, I was inside on the hundred and somethingth floor of the building.  I breathed a sigh of relief as I looked at all the horrified office workers staring at me.  Yeah... in New York, they would be freaked out by someone crashing into a building.

"It's okay, everyone -- I'll fix this!"  I carefully picked up the me-shaped piece of wall I had knocked out and put it back in the hole I formed.  A quick reach behind the back, and I had some sealant that I laid over the cracks.  "There, good as new!"  Somehow I don't think this re-assured too many people.  Pretty sure I heard one of them mutter about how they had enough trouble with super-fights and didn't need B-listers like me making it worse.

But hey, at least I survived the villain's trap, I thought as I drank some water from their water cooler.  I walked off in triumph, oblivious to the multiple leaks in my body that the water I drank was coming out of.  Just another day in the life of the city's 10th-favorite hero: the Loony Toon.
