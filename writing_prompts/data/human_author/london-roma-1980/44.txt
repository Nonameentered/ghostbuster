This felt -- in a great way -- like part of a Twilight Zone episode.  It had that supernatural form to it and and the ending that took advantage of it.

I couldn't figure out what was going on with the narrator.  Are they a spirit?  A corpse?  But how could she see?  I feel like this needs an Act I, but yeah, word restraint.

The emphasis on MY was great, and I kind of wish you'd done it with the family, since you'd think that would've been most infuriating to the narrator.

Wonderful setup here; hope there's more!
