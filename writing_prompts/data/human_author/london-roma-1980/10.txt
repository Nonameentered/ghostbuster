"I suppose you're here to say I had it coming too."

Hunter lay in his bed, his body covered in bandages from the waist down.  Heart monitors beeped around him.  His normally impeccable physique was now hidden beneath a simple hospital gown.  His entire face was covered in scars and slashes from where automobile glass found its mark.

Above him hovered Chris, his old job rival.  Ever since he was brought in with much fanfare by the boss a few years ago, it became clear that Chris was destined for big things.  Hunter wanted them too, and he had seniority and the ear of those that mattered.  So began their cat and mouse, their song and dance, their attack and parry.

"Look, there was a time I might.  I mean, we both know the shit you did.  Hell, the whole industry knows.  All this time, the ride over, the elevator, everything... I was..."

"Lemme guess," Hunter cut him off as he always would.  "You were thinking you shouldn't be here."

"Well, yeah.  I knew what you'd think.  But this... this doesn't seem real!"

"It's real.  Trust me, you get a catheter jammed into you, it IS real.  Do yourself a favor, kid." Hunter called Chris "kid" from the day he arrived; what was once a disdainful nickname now felt more cautious and sincere.  "Buckle up."

"I will.  What are the doctors saying?"

"Lotta damage and a lotta surgery.  I'm pretty much done.  I..."  Hunter held back tears, even to the end protecting his image.  "I don't know if I'll ever have kids.  How do I tell my fiancee?"

All of this blindsided Chris like a steel chair to the temple.  "Give it a year?" he offered.  "I know my friend got some nerve damage and he was fine in a year."

"Your friend's a little nutty, with all due respect," Hunter interjected.  "Nah... unless there's a miracle, I'm done."

Chris found words coming out he never thought he'd say.  "You... you can't be done.  You?  After all this time, all this buildup?  You spent years making sure you were forever, man!  And... I know, I was the guy you stepped on!  All of that posturing, all of that backstabbing, and now that's it?  It's all for nothing?"

Hunter shrugged as he struggled to adjust himself in the bed.  "Crazy, ain't it?  So, yeah, you've wanted to see karma come and bite me in the ass for years, haven't you?  Lemme have it."

Chris looked Hunter up and down.  He felt himself ticking off a list of grievances he could air, a thousand items long or longer.  He should be mentally drinking champagne and celebrating right now.  He knew Hunter would be relieved with one less target to hammer down if the roles were reversed.

But here, at the moment of truth, Chris slumped into a chair in the room.  "What's there to say?  Everything we went through feels so fake now.  All that you did is just noise.  And I know a lot of people would want to kick you when you're down, but... well... I feel like I need to thank you.  I came into this company before I was 30, and I was destined for greatness.  And I got a big head.  You made sure I understood the ins and outs and pluses and minuses... and I... if I didn't listen, would I even be here today?  I'm sorry this happened to you.  Let me know if you need help with the bills."

"...nah," Hunter groaned out.  "Big boss already has it covered."

"You sure?  I could do a fundraiser to..."

"Yeah, he's sure.  I just need to rest right now.  The painkillers are kickin' in.  Thanks for coming, Chris.  I'll see you on Monday."
