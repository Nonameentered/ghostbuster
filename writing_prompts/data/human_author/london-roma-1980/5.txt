Tim smiled at the quality of the picture.  He couldn't wait to show it to Naomi.  She made the perfect subject for...

...Naomi?  Where'd she go?

As Tim did a quick scan of his surroundings for her, certain she couldn't have run off that far, he heard her voice coming from an unexpected location.  "Where'd everyone go?" she said.  Tim quickly looked back at the camera screen.  The Naomi on it was looking around, equally confused.

"No way," Tim said, loud enough for her to notice.

"Tim?  What's going on?  Where is everyone?  I can't see anything but you!"

Tim realized he'd have to act fast.  "Wait right there.  I need to check the manual."

"Right WHERE?  Tim, what's going on here?  Half the world disappeared!"

Tim tried to be reassuring as he flipped through the pages of the manual to find the part he needed.  *No wonder the camera had that much memory,* he thought.  Finally, he got to the chapter he needed: "Editing, Saving, and Discharging."  *Editing?  Really.*

"Tim, talk to me!  I'm feeling a little claustrophobic here!"

Tim looked back at the camera, at the image of Naomi, which now was in full panic.  "It's okay, Naomi," he said.  "I just gotta follow a few steps..."  He hoped Naomi didn't see his smile as he said that.
