I stood in front of the mirror.  I was never this nervous as the guy, but now, I wanted to make sure all the fabric was in place and all the curves fit.  It was our first social event since the accident, and the most important part to me was showing I could move on with my life.

Still, I may have spent a few seconds too long making sure, because Stefani manifested again.  "Out of your system yet?"

I blushed.  "Too much?"

"Just a little.  I get it, male brain excited.  But... you've seen it all.  Why does this hold extra interest?"

I smirked.  "Listen -- it's not that you haven't been blessed with a wonderful body, but after a while, the novelty wears off.  It's not that you stop looking good, but this is new!  I've never seen or been you so formal.  And it's wonderful!  This suits you so well!"

"Well, that's sweet, but can we keep it friendly between us?  Anyway, yes, it fits, it's beautiful, thank you.  But what will Matthew think?"

Oh, right, our date to Homecoming.  "Relax.  He's going to say all the right things.  I don't know if he's purely interested in you, er, us, um... anyway, don't go rushing in."

"Duh, I'm in charge tonight for a reason, Petey.  Matthew's nice, but it's never happening.  Hell, Carolyn's got a better chance of happening!"  She laughed at her own reference, as if to rub in the reality.

"Hey, she's cute, it was worth a shot..."

"Yeah, yeah, you'll get over it.  Now stand back.  I got this."  I felt her rush back into our mind and take over the controls.  Stefani picked up her purse and slipped on her heels to head downstairs.  But even she couldn't resist one last smile to the mirror.

Two hours in, and everything was progressing smoothly.  The car ride was uneventful, the talk was small, and the meal was lovely.  The first few minutes were a little lonely, though -- apparently, Matt hadn't heard about the concept of "fashionably late".  Still, Stefani was game to play along.  Then, while sipping her punch, she felt a tap on her shoulder.

"Care!"

"Steffy!  You made it!"  The two exchanged a big hug.  "How's it going?"

"Slow.  I'm glad you're here.  His group isn't quite my drive."

"Hey, don't worry about it.  Let's get him in our group.  Oh, shoot, first let's fix that face."  Carolyn practically pulled Stef by the wrist as they left the cafeteria where the dance was.  The two snuck into the women's room and laid out their purses to clean up.

"So, what's he like?"

"Eh... he's okay.  It's a good experience, but it's just not gonna happen."

"Too bad.  I guess better this way.  Does he know that?"

"Maybe?  He hasn't moved yet.  I dunno what to do if he does."

"Well, he's not another Brian, right?"

"No way!  Wait, is this color too much?"

"Nah, it works."

"Thanks, cool.  Yeah, I guess I can talk to him in a few days, but it's not like I'm feeling it."

"Hey, maybe he's freaking like you are.  Bring him to us, I'll get a read."

"You would?"

"What are friends for?  C'mon, let's go."

&#x200B;

It was almost time for the last dance.  From my position observing, Stefani and Matthew were getting along fine, but not exactly at a deeper level.  I'm sure they'd be Breakfast Club friends in another world, but the good news was that I didn't sense we had a boyfriend coming out of this.  Still, things can change.

I watched our eyes dart around the cafeteria, but realized the problem: no sign of Matthew.  I know I had to get all that punch out of my system, but I did expect him when I got back.  This was odd.  Fortunately, Shawn -- Matt's buddy -- was by the door.

"Stef, ask him," I muttered in my "back-seat" position.  The rest happened.

"Hey, uh... Shawn, right?"

"Yeah.  Stefani?"

"Yeah, nice to meet you.  Uh, have you seen Matthew?  I just wanna make sure he's okay, since he's my ride and all."

"Yeah, he told me he needed a smoke.  I'm sure he'll be back."

"Thanks!"  Stefani was about to sit down when I leaned forward to switch into control.  I had her turn around and head out into the hallway.

"Hey, what's going on?  I thought we agreed I was in charge, Pete!"  Stefani's voice in my head was not amused, but then again, Shawn left me unamused too.

"Matt doesn't smoke," I intoned back to her in the internal dialogue.  "I remember this from last year, but I didn't think that idiot would do it with you.  Follow me."  Now fully in control of us, I walked around the hallway and turned to face the exit door to the front parking lot.  I knew what was next -- go through the door, see the bench on the right, and Matthew would be caught red-handed.

Just as I reached for the door handle, though, I heard a protest.  "WAIT!"  Stefani's voice indicated a panic.  "I mean, it's no big deal; I don't have feelings for him."

I paused, our hand on the door.  "It doesn't matter, Stef; it's best you see this."

"Do we have to?  Can't I just note he doesn't smell of smoke and ask for the truth?"

"He'll say he forgot his lighter.  Ugh, I was afraid of this.  C'mon -- we gotta make him stop it."

"NO!"  Stefani's tone of reply meant I, we, were still holding the door handle this entire argument.  "Please... I don't want to go."
