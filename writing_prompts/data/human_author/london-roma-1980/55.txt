CRYSTAL-1: "No!  NO!  Don't you dare!"

CRYSTAL-2: "Why not?  What's the alternative?  Live as a nobody for my life? Worry about my children?  This is YOUR world.  I don't belong.  It's easier for me to just go home."

CRYSTAL-1: "And what, get your husband killed?  You're smarter than this!"

CRYSTAL-2: "No, YOU'RE smarter than this!  Everything will work out.  This isn't working out.  I can't take it anymore.  I have to go home."

CRYSTAL-1: "You can't!"

CRYSTAL-2: "Watch me."

CRYSTAL-1: "Come back here!"

*Crystal-1 yanks at Crystal-2's hair to stop her, only to get a slap in the face.  She jumps at her opposite number, and before long a full-on fight is breaking out.  The two Andys reach in to grab a competitor, not necessarily their own.*

ANDY-2: "Stop it!  STOP IT!"

ANDY-1: "Get a HOLD of yourself!"

CRYSTAL-1: "I already do!"

CRYSTAL-2: "Get her off me!"

ANDY-2: "Enough!"

ANDY-1: "You're out of control!"

ANDY-2: "CALM DOWN!!"

*Both Crystals let go of each other and curl up in shock.*

ANDY-1: "Crystal, honey... go to your room and calm down.  You need to."

CRYSTAL-1: "B-b... okay."

*Crystal-1 walks off.  Crystal-2 looks at both Andys.*

CRYSTAL-2: "Thank you.  Now I have to do the right thing."

ANDY-1: "Well, you can TRY.  But we can't communicate with them, we can't get back to them, and frankly, the second you leave this house you're a science experiment.  Is that what you want?"

CRYSTAL-2: "That's why I have to do this.  I have to find my Stone... and I have to get her to get us back."

*Meanwhile, in the Bohr lab...*

HART-2: "Okay, you have all the plans ready?"

HART-1: "Almost.  What's the substance you labeled on Part 27?"

HART-2: "Oh, that's how you send as well as receive; it's a coating of marconium oxide."

HART-1: "Of what?"

HART-2: "Marconium oxide.  It's pretty common."

HART-1: "I haven't heard of it."

HART-2: "You're kidding.  You don't have Marconium?  You know, element 43, symbol Mr, used in message sending due to being able to conduct quantum energy?"

*Hart-1 quickly consults a periodic table.*

HART-1: "We have a problem.  There's no such thing on this planet.  In fact, there is no natural element 43.  We had to [make it synthetically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technetium)."

HART-2: "Okay... well, that complicates matters.  Now, to get someone through the portal with regular silicon oxide -- you do have silicon, right?"

HART-1: "Abundance."

HART-2: "Good.  Anyway, that substitution will make it receive but not send.  Someone would have to go halfway through the portal and pull their target in.  As long as they have contact with Earth-2, they could return.  I suppose that's good news for your visitors."

HART-1: "I guess so.  Okay, we will begin construction."

HART-2: "Roger that.  We will continue to work on a one-way on our side.  Over and out."

*Within a minute, Hart-1 has left the lab.  Stone-1 enters... and as she does, the radio sounds again.*

STONE-2: "Acknowledge broadcast!  This is an order."

*Stone-1 looks around, sees no one, and smiles to herself.  She answers.*

STONE-1: "Acknowledged.  God Save our Leader."

STONE-2: "I knew you were on our side.  Welcome to the Empire.  We will require your help in your world."

STONE-1: "The criminal?"

STONE-2: "You are to bring them to your current location as we set up the portal to your world.  Once it is set up, we will take the criminal and victim and we will bring them back.  Your compliance will save your planet from any hostility."

STONE-1: "I will need safe transport for myself as well.  Two of us will be able to achieve glory twice as fast."

STONE-2: "This will be acceptable.  Our combined efforts should be able to crush Hart's resistance before he does something we all regret."

STONE-1: "Good.  When the portal is ready, I will make the move.  God Save our Leader."

STONE-2: "God Save, and goodnight."

*The radio goes silent again.  Stone-1 looks around and sees Hart-1 is looking at her, aghast.  Stone-1 calmly smiles.*

STONE-1: "You should know by now, Dr. Hart.  Science is the search for truth... but humanity is knowing when to lie."
