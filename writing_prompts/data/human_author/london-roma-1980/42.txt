Dayum.  This is some heavy stuff here.

One crit I would make is that this feels more like a freeform poem than a story.  That's fine, and to deliver the impact it does in under 200 words means it's still really good, but I feel like the formatting would be better served with only 1-2 sentences between line breaks.  In a story like this, the weight of the task contrasted with the (implied) distance taken by officers and civilians is what hits home.  Having many paragraphs would give each sentence a bigger emotional oomph.

But here's the big thing: I can see this in my mind's eye as the "you" of the story.  If you can put someone at Verdun or the Bulge so easily, and carry them into the idea of internal conflict without claiming a resolution -- which is what is deserved here -- that's a home run.  Great work slamming the emotion home!
