Oh, wow.  I get vibes of Deadpool and Hancock and a few other "flawed superhero" stories from this one.  That's a heck of a twist at the end.

The thing I like the most out of it is that it combines both "great last line" and "start of a series" in it.  If you wanted to give us more Scott, you could from here.

One thing I was criticize here is that with an economy of words, you need to decide what needs more emphasis.  I see you went with the physical descriptions of Violet and Scott, but if this story were longer, I'd want a full fight scene.  If Scott knows he's immortal, what would his fighting style be?  How did he get those injuries he shrugged off?  A bigger description there would make the twist ending land even harder.

Overall, though, the big thing is you have me wanting more from Scott, and maybe more of his interactions with Violet.  That's important!  Good job!
