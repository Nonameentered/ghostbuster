*At the lab.*

HART-1: "They're on their way?"

STONE-1: "Yes.  Everything is in order.  My counterpart thinks I'm on her side.  I've got it all worked out."

HART-1: "I hope so.  They know we're speaking to both sides, I'm sure.  I am suspect in their eyes -- you are in charge for this."

STONE-1: "Thank you.  How are you doing?"

HART-1: "...well, I have to be honest.  It's an incredible coincidence it happened to this couple.  Andy and I go back a long time.  We spent time together at a summer camp for the gifted and became fast friends.  That bond... I mean, it's why I've had so much trouble here.  I want to do what's right for science.  I wanted to make sure things were presented neutrally."

STONE-1: "And then you heard from yourself."

HART-1: "Yes.  As unusual as it sounds to a neutral observer, because one of me has a stake in this, I feel I do too.  Certainly I've seen the emotional toll on both sets of our subjects... and I never supposed it would happen to us."

STONE-1: "Life works in mysterious ways, Doctor.  I don't pretend to know why I'm an army commander in that world.  All I know is that... apparently, my backbone isn't what I thought it was."

HART-1: "Doctor Stone, there's no connection outside of similar DNA between our worlds.  Their Stone may not realize how far gone things have become.  We've seen in our world that a charismatic leader can cause people to lose rationality.  In a way, the bigger surprise is that their Hart is a soldier of fortune."

STONE-1: "Emergencies do strange things to strange people.  Look at us.  We're planning on defying an entire empire and protecting people whom we just met.  We can talk hypotheticals all day and discuss the patterns of quarks, photons, and wormholes... but as much as some of our colleagues think otherwise, maybe free will can defy observation."

HART-1: "The id overriding the superego, in a way.  Makes humanity unique."

*A pause.*

HART-1: "Anyway, was the portal built to spec?"

STONE-1: "They say so.  One last inspection?"

*Hart-1 takes a look around the doorway-shaped gate in his lab.  He walks through it; nothing happens.  He examines a giant glass tube next to it, with a solid white pillar inside it, showing a rough external surface.*

HART-1: "So if our calculations are correct, when we connect these two, the power source in this tube will allow travel through the gate."

STONE-1: "That's what the plans said, yes."

HART-1: "Now... they'll be entering and exiting on this side, so let's put this against the wall."

STONE-1: "Good idea, Doc."

*The two scientists move the gate in place.*

HART-1: "So what is your plan again, Doctor Stone?"

STONE-1: "My idea is that my opposite number will have to step through the gate to allow passage both ways.  Otherwise, she'd have no way to try to get her quarry to return to Earth-2.  When she does this, I will grab her arm and pull her completely into our world.  We can then negotiate: their freedom and their children for her return."

HART-1: "There's one problem... didn't you promise there would be no resistance?"

*Stone smirks.*

STONE-1: "I promised the couple would not resist.  I made no such claim about myself, because as far as Other Me knows, I'm on her side and have no need to."

HART-1: "Then there's one thing left to do before we begin prepping lab work.  How did you get a hold of the Empire?"

STONE-1: "She gave me the address of her channel and how to initiate calls.  Why?"

HART-1: "I need to find Hart-2's frequency.  He could ruin everything if he's not careful."

*A buzzer is heard.*

STONE-1: "One of the couples is here."

HART-1: "Talk to them while they go to the medical wing."
