ANDY-1: "Doctor Hart, how are you certain?"

DR. HART: "I'm sorry, I overstated the issue, but it is true.  It appears Earth-2 does have two-way communication, and my counterpart sent the record to tell me how to do my own.  If all works well, you will not be the only ones talking to yourself."

ANDY-1: "That's a good start."

CRYSTAL-2: "But how do you know any of this?"

DR. HART: "My apologies... here's what happened."

*Flashback -- Scene: Niels Bohr Institute, Copenhagen, Earth-1.*

DR STONE: "Sir... we're receiving a transmission from Earth-2 again."

DR. HART: "Send it to print.  It's probably the regime again."

DR. STONE: "I don't think so... it's a series of instructions."

DR. HART: "Instructions?  So drawings, illustrations... they've upgraded to faxing?"

DR. STONE: "One moment... checking the contents."

*A pause as they fully print out.*

DR. STONE: "You're going to want to see this.  It's not from the regime -- it's from... you."

*Hart quickly examines the documents.*

DR. HART: "Me?  You must be mistaken.  This is not my work."

DR. STONE: "It is your name, and the handwriting is similar."

DR. HART: "Wait... you said Earth-2, right?  I guess even we have counterparts.  Let's talk to Engineering and get this assembled."

*Hours later.*

DR. STONE: "Now that we have it, we should turn it one and see why someone in Earth-2 wanted us to have it."

DR. HART: "You have the headphones?"

DR. STONE: "Yes, sir.  Here we go."

*Dr. Stone activates the device... before taking a shocked look at Dr. Hart.*

DR. HART: "What is it?"

DR. STONE: "You're speaking on the line right now.  I'll put it through the speaker.  We should respond."

*Stone turns on the speakers.  We hear:*

HART'S VOICE: "...all potential intersecting Earths.  This is Professor Lewis Hart of the European Resistance.  We seek all scientific minds to aid in a plan to escape the brutal tyranny of..."

***Note from the Fourth Wall: from now on, the scientists will have the "1" and "2" suffixes, depending on if they are "our" Earth or not.***

HART-1: "Hart, can you hear me?  This is your counterpart in our world.  We have received your transmission.  Over."

HART-2: "Thank god.  We need your help.  Over."

HART-1: "How can we be of assistance in this dimension?  Over."

HART-2: "Our resistance is working on opening a portal to a safer and sustainable Earth.  I must know: is your Earth qualified for us to escape this regime?  Over."

*The doctors look at each other.*

HART-1: "Uncertain, Dr. Hart.  While our government remains stable and at pre-plague levels, our resources would be incapable of sustaining a large influx.  We need to know how many you plan on sending to us.  Over."

*A pause.*

HART-2: "No... no, never mind.  We need a depopulated Earth.  Too many people suffer here.  We're stuck in the jaws of madness... you must help us scan other available Earth co-ordinates.  Over."

STONE-1: "Dr. Hart, with all due respect, we don't know how to send anyone to any universe.  How do you propose we do it?  Over."

HART-2: "...that voice... that voice!  You're with her!  GET HER OUT!  She's bad news!  You have to believe me!!  OVER!"

*Hart-1 motions for Stone-1 to leave.*

HART-1: "Doctor, I can assure you that no matter what you think you heard, my colleague Doctor Stone is working with me in a peaceful environment to advance human society.  Our worlds are similar, but not -- repeat, not -- the same.  Over."

HART-2: "I hope you're right.  That voice... Charlotte Stone is known as the Bitch of Brighton around here.  She betrayed her entire group to the Regime.  Half our colleagues died -- the others joined, unwillingly.  I escaped about a month ago and found the Resistance.  I've been able to use our tech to try to get help.  You're the first one I found.  Over."

HART-1: "Ten-four.  Dr. Hart, we can receive your audio and your written transcriptions at the co-ordinates you have.  I can also tell you that we know of your world through visitors, though their arrival was unexpected and thus far not reproducible on our end.  Over."

HART-2: "So what you're saying is you can't send us anything?  Over."

HART-1: "I have my mind; that is all.  If you can send me your work on portal technology, I will see if I can refine it.  In the meantime, godspeed and good luck.  We stand by for any messages.  Over."

HART-2: "Roger.  Over and out."

*Hart-1 motions Stone-1 back into the room.  His neutral face is replaced with one of determination.*

HART-1: "Doctor... remember how I said the most important thing we could do was lead with our heads?"

STONE-1: "Yes."

HART-1: "From now on, we are helping us.  This isn't just about science.  This is now personal."
