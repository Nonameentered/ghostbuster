Okay, first thing: maybe I've been on Reddit too much, but I chuckled at the fact that Karen was unwilling to go on first visit.

That said, this threw me for a loop:

>Death opened his bag and stuffed Karen into it with the others

Okay, so we establish earlier that the soul takes a human form and still, in a way, acts and thinks as a human.  Do you think they'd take well to being tossed like garbage into a bag?  And is it a bag of holding or something so that they're not on top of each other?  It just seems like one minute the soul is humanoid and the next it's an object.  There's no real transition between the two.

There's a start of something here, but I couldn't get past this.  I want to know more about the collection process.
