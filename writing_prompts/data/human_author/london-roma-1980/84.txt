She had floated aimlessly through space for years before landing on the planet much like her own.  The pod she was in, no bigger than she was, landed in the field, absorbing all the shock of the collision and leaving her unharmed.  The window in her pod wasn't large enough for her to take in her new location, and until the mechanisms registered landfall and began, that was all she had.

It had been decades since the process began.  One minute, she was with friends, ready to celebrate, and then another, spending time with her love, when suddenly she was carried away.  Even after they introduced themselves to her, she did not comprehend -- just that they wanted to examine her for science.  And she agreed.

And on that day, her new hosts locked her into stasis, then carried her to their home.  She was X-rayed, cleansed, probed, and worst of all, displayed for their general public.  From her case, she saw other creatures, some like her and some most unlike her, also being gawked at by the strange host creatures and others.  Maybe students, maybe tourists, it didn't matter.  She was essentially no longer human.

It came as a relief when her captors took her to this pod and placed her inside.  She saw on the window in front of her symbols... a trajectory... a sphere.  Then as she attempted to process it all, the pod was sent careening away.  Her only guess was that she was headed to a sphere.  Her own planet or another?  It didn't matter.

And now she had landed.  She waited -- it was the only human thing besides think she could do.  Was she on the origin world of Earth?  Her homeland of Terra?  Another colony?  A new land?  No answers followed.  Her captors had to know they left her conscious, right?  Were they thinking she was asleep?

After several hours, she heard a motor whir.  She felt needles in her temples, the top and bottom of her spine, and her longest nerves.  A familiar tingling came over her entire body; it was the same she felt so long ago when the alien tech rendered her like this.  After a few minutes, she was able to move her fingers, then her feet.  Her arms moving helped the most as she pressed the button to open her pod.

An hour or so later, all movement was restored.  She sat up in the pod and looked around.  Wherever she was, it was hospitable and Terra-like.  But that mattered less to her.  She spent the next few minutes stretching, flexing, then crawling, walking, running, leaping.  Her future life could wait for another day.  The life that was taken from her years ago had returned.
