That's my son.  My wonderful, wonderful son.

That's not just his mother here saying he's wonderful.  You ask anyone who's seen him.  He's so deferential to his elders; he treats his peers with the utmost respect; he takes care of the animals he sees.  I assure you, he would never even hurt a fly!  There's never been another man like him.

Yes, it's true, when he met her in school, things were a little unusual.  Yes, he cared about her more than she did about him.  But that's just how my son is.  He's a wonderful boy you would take home to your mother.  And like I said: there's no way he'd hurt a fly!

And she saw that.  She understood him.  She learned all about him, and it became beautiful.  Everyone talked about how sweet he was to her.  How much he doted on her.  When she left for college, he changed his plans to go with her -- what a romantic gesture!  I knew he would take such good care of her.  I even told her not to worry -- my boy would never hurt a fly.

That's why I talk about the rumors, though.  People making such scandalous claims about my little boy.  I don't know what to say other than it makes no sense.  Everyone saw how much he took care of her and how much he wanted her in his life.  Why would he risk that with the behavior they talked about?  I ask you, if you saw them together -- and everyone in this neighborhood did -- you wouldn't think there was a thing wrong with them.  She had every material gift she could ever want.  And my boy?  He made sure to keep them happy together.  He'd never do anything else.  Never even hurt a fly.

Oh, yes, I saw the letters.  I saw the text messages.  I don't understand them either.  He made sure she was taken care of at every opportunity.  Why would she ever talk to another man?  And... and the claims that she was looking to divorce the man who had cared for her all her life -- you have to understand how ludicrous that idea is.  What could he possibly have done that would keep her away from him?  This is my son we're talking about!  He'd never hurt a fly.

What's that, officer?  The timing?  Why no, it's not what you think!  I understand you have to ask everyone, and when I see him I'll make sure to tell him you were here.  But just because people were starting those ideas that she was going to leave him... why would that mean that he's a suspect?  It was a car accident!  They said her brakes just didn't work!  It's so tragic, but you don't need to do anything.  I've told you before, my son wouldn't hurt a fly.

Thank you, officer.  I'll keep in touch.

...yes, my son would never hurt a fly.  Because *flies never hurt him.*
