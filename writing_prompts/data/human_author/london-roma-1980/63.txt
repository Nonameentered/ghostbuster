**After School**

"Stef? It's almost dinner."

"Can I eat later, Mom? I'm not hungry." Truth be told we were too emotional after today to be hungry. I had spent the time in charge telling classmates that it was still too soon to be myself -- a half-truth if ever there was one -- while she took herself back over and poured out all sorts of complex emotions to the counselor. How can you explain you see the person you killed and not make it sound like a hallucination of grief?

I just sat in the backyard, staring from the top of a hill at the sun. It was 7:30, my homework was done, and the September night was slowly beginning. I knew I didn't want dinner until all of them went to bed. I also knew that, while I could look at her -- well, our -- memories, it wasn't the same as knowing them.Knowing a new family. Leaving my old one. It was all settling in. And so were the tears, just as they had for her before.

"Hey... Petey... what's wrong?" Stefani manifested next to me as she had before. "You're doing fine. C'mon, you sure you don't want dinner?"

I looked over my shoulder, but spoke quietly in case anyone heard my apparently one-sided conversation. "It's not my dinner. It's not my house. It's not my family. It's not my life."

Stefani sighed. "I mean, that USED to be my family and my life. Heck, I used to have my body. But... here we are. It's what we gotta do."

I paused, not sure if that was a shutdown comment or just an acceptance of reality. But I had to ask about earlier today. "Stefani... how are you so calm now? I know you hurt too. I saw it."

"...well, I've had time to adjust to... this. I told you, I went before Heaven and Hell and found out I didn't belong. Time means nothing to them."

"But why THIS?"

"For you, Petey. So you could live. I wanted you to have the second chance I was getting. You are now."

My mind, or what could be called MY mind, began to race. "For me? You gave this all up for me? You care about me?"

Stefani shrugged. "Dying does change how you feel about life." She looked out at the setting sun in the distance, causing me to turn that way as well. "You know, maybe you are right about being out here. Just... just look."

I wasn't sure what she meant for a few seconds, but the many hues of the sunset cinched it in for me. Under normal circumstances, I would never see this sunset. I would never have a meal with people who cared about me. I'd never see friends at school again, and I'd never realize how much I meant to them.

"Stef? You know how little I felt before this... when I was me?"

"...not sure I do. I mean, no offense, but I didn't think much about you as a person one way or another."

"That's just it... I... I thought of myself as a bit player in the world. I saw you and your friends as the stars and all of this as some... some play that I barely existed in. But now it's like... I wish I had the chance to have done more, to have interacted more."

"Well... I guess that's... what you have. You have more days. You have the days I have." I thought I felt Stefani lean on my shoulder even though she had no presence to be felt. "We'll figure this out. It's what we both need -- each other, time, and..."

I finished the thought as I looked out into nature's most beautiful portrait, a gift to humanity every night that I felt like only the two of understood the value of. "And sunsets."
