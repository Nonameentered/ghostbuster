Thanks for the detailed look!  Sorry, I should've responded earlier.

"without a trace of leather contact" is meant to mean it looks like he hasn't been hit yet.  Leather, in this case, is a synecdoche for the gloves the boxers wear (which, as you know, aren't leather now but used to be).

"eight-count I took" is meant to be a knockdown.  In modern boxing, even if the boxer pops right back up, he's given a mandatory eight-count before being checked on.

"They say I'm good to go" is meant to be the doctor and trainer, but word constraints happened.

The ending is meant to be abrupt.  If the fight had gone the distance, the framing would continue because we're meant to be examining his thoughts between rounds.  But the winning KO happened in Round 9.

Anyway, I don't want to sound like I'm not taking your crit -- these are more clarification than defense.  I admit there were flaws in it, but it sounds like overall you liked it!
