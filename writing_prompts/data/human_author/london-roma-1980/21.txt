*54... 55... 56... let sleep come for me...*

*...sleep... come for...*

*Okay, this has happened to others, they said.  My pod didn't get the juice, fine.  Just hit the button to alert the doctor.*

*...hit the button to alert the doctor...*

*hit... the...*

no.  this can't be happening.  the paralytic works, but the anesthetic didn't!  where's the doctor?  when's his next round?  how long is this going to go on?

Wait... how long until the cold?  I'm still warm.  Still 98.6, right?  I'm not a popsicle yet... there's a chance they'll hear my signals.  Just need to get adrenaline, start the heart.  They'll notice!  They have to!

OVER HERE!  SOMEONE!  WE GOT A PROBLEM!  I CAN SEE YOU, EVERYONE!  MY EYES ARE OPEN!  HELP!  I FEEL LIKE I'M IN CEMENT IN HERE!  Come on, come on, wiggle something, make it clear!

What was that?  It's... something turned on...

OH GOD NO!  THE CRYONICS!  OH GOD I CAN FEEL MY TOES GO NUMB... MY SKIN ALL OVER... I WANT TO SHIVER, I CAN'T, OH GOD NOT LIKE THIS... SOMEONE, ALARM, ANYTHING!

Is this really how I'm going to die?  Volunteer for a mission through a wormhole, 1000 of us headed to a new world, and I'm going to freeze to death?  Motionless, bare naked, inside some giant clicky pen of a tube for a bed!?  NO!  NOT LIKE THIS!  THEY'LL FIND ME -- THE ALARM WILL TELL THEM!  IT... IT HAS TO!  PLEASE!!!

Where is everyone?  Where is the doctor?  Don't they... know I'm going to... die?  They said the anesthetic would protect... me... Where is it... Is that it?  I'm losing energy so fast.  I feel colder.  No more suffering soon... just the end.  Just peace.

no feeling... no hands, no feet, no limbs... just my mind... so cold... i feel it all...

*sleepy... finally sleepy... time to rest... so much rest...*

*...thank you... goodbye... 57... 58... 59...................................*
