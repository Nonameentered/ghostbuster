Amelia quickly pressed the button for 16, figuring the elevator was just going up because she got on at the ground floor.  *Whew, problem solved*, she thought.  *What's the big deal anyway?*

The elevator continued its upward journey as Amelia relaxed.  The toll of the day meant she wasn't in the mood for anything other than a period of rest.  She closed her eyes and leaned against the back of the elevator, noticing with a bit of surprise that the elevator had rear doors.  *Well, I guess staff have cleaning areas,* she rationalized.

The elevator came to an abrupt stop.  Amelia stood back up, ready to get off on her level, but the floor indicator read 13.  *Huh, I didn't press for the 13th floor,* she thought to herself.  As if to make sure, she double-checked the panel.  Indeed the 16 was still alight.  No other buttons were indicated for stops, least of all 13.  *Wait, 13?*  Every day when she hauled herself up the stairs, she went from 12 to 14.  It's not as if the 13th was inaccessible either -- it just didn't exist due to superstition!  So where was she?

"Scanning," she heard from the elevator.  "Please remain in the center of the elevator."

Amelia jumped back from the doors and stood, waiting.  She thought she heard something run down a track from the ceiling to the floor of the elevator -- something electronic.  But why scan her?

"Exhaustion levels over acceptable amount," the voice said.  *They know I'm tired?*  "Commencing 24 hour clock."

Before Amelia could ask whatever said that, a panel opened from the side and a beam of... something... hit Amelia.  She felt a blast of some form of energy on her.  *What in the world...?*

As the beam stopped, Amelia heard doors open behind her.
