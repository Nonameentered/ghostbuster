Liv resignedly nodded.  "Just... just one request.  If I'm already ruined... film it."

The man laughed.  "Film it?  Why?"

"Because if you're punishing me, I want proof that I've been punished before they try to cyberize me."

The man smiled.  "I'll have some good late-night material, then."  He picked up his camera and turned it on.

Liv, almost ashamedly, began to dance for the lens.  As she made the sweeping motions of what she was told was a Martian mating ritual, her eyes darted from place to place, noting where everything was.  She continued her performance, slowly having to remove her hairpiece and robe, but collecting a syringe she kept.  What was inside was her ticket out.

She beckoned the camera lens closer as she slinked on the lab table.  The man, sure enough, moved in for a close-up.  And when he did, she struck, plunging the syringe straight into his heart... right where it had to be to take full effect.

"What was THAT!?  You assaulted me!  You're getting put under for... wait... what's happ..."

Liv smiled as her work took effect before pressing a button on a security panel.  "My research may be unauthorized, but it had fruit.  What's going into your heart now is my blood, combined with a special toxin I invented.  By the time the Gaean you made be a guard here arrives, it should take full effect."

&#x200B;

The guard stormed down the hallway.  That button was used by late night researchers in case of a need for backup.  He raced to the laboratory hallway and rounded the corner, phaser set to STUN.  He barged in to find...

...two Dr. Ordies.

"Everybody stay still!  What's going on here?"

"She assaulted me to cover up her illegal research!  Get her!"

"No!  This one shapeshifted into me to frame me and got caught!  Take her out!"

"I've been poisoned!  It's a trick!  You have to shoot her!"

Back and forth it went for five or six lines.  Finally, one Liv spoke straight to the guard.  "You know what, forget it.  I'd rather die than be framed; kill us both."

"No, don't!  It's--"

A single beam fired, and the other Liv was held permanently in place, where she would remain until the Martian Police arrived.  With the evidence on the video camera, the rest would be a snap.  She would be convicted of abuse of a protected class, and cyberization would soon follow.  She would probably have to spend the rest of her life watching herself spout pre-programmed lines, giving Noxadean salutes, and losing free will and sanity.  

The guard turned to the moving Liv.  "You knew they'd find you.  You gave me the key phrase.  But how'd you know they'd pull the fake twin trick?"

Liv -- the Gaean Liv -- smiled.  "I've studied."
