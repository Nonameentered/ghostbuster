Aww, Thank you!  I really enjoy building this world, and it's interesting to do it on the fly like this, instead of planning everything out to the last detail like I usually do with longer pieces. 

I enjoyed the humour as well, it's always fun to put in.

And believe it or not, it was really difficult on the second rule to make sure the student didn't get away. I always prefer a happy ending, like on this one. I'm glad they're okay too.

And as always, if you come up with a fourth rule (no pressure) I'll give it a try too.
