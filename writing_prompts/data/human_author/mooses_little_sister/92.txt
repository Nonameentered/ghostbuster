"You want what?" I stared down at the man who'd summoned me. The wind blew the dust around our feet, the crossroads quiet, as if we were the only two beings alive in the world.

"I want to make pizza. I want to make the world's greatest pizza. That's what I want in exchange for my soul. Can you do that?" He squinted up at me as if he doubted my ability.

"I'm the Devil, man. The big boss, the most powerful entity in hell and you ask for pizza? I could make you a king, I could destroy nations for you, or give them as a gift. And you want pizza?" The man raised his eyebrows.

"Well?"

"All right. It's your funeral. Deal. One soul for the ability to make great—"

"World's greatest."

"World's greatest pizza. See you in a few years." Feeling the contract tighten around my skin, I vanished back to my realm.

——————

My curiosity got the better of me, though I held out for ten years. I had to see what the world considered the greatest pizza. So, taking on the usual cover of a good-looking human, I walked to the man's house. It was odd, that he still lived here in this small place. Surely he could start a successful restaurant and with the profits buy at least a two-storey home. I knocked on the door, trying to think of a cover story.

Whatever lie I'd summoned vanished as the door opened and the smell wafted out. It smelled—for want of a better word— divine. Two children blinked up at me confused.

"Who is it, girls—oh." The man came into view, wiping his hands on a dish towel. He knew it was me; you can always recognize the one that holds your soul. Nodding to me, he gestured to the two little girls.

"This is Uncle Luci. He'll be coming around once in a while. Probably on pizza night. Make him feel welcome." Instantly two small hands grabbed onto mine and I was dragged inside, as one of the girls proudly informed me that her daddy makes the greatest pizza in the world.

I've got to admit, the pizza was pretty amazing. But more than that, I rather enjoyed the family I found myself with. As the man walked me to the door, I couldn't help the question that rose to my lips.

"Is this it? This is what you're going to do with my gift?" The man looked at me as if he didn't understand the question.

"What else would I do with it? Those girls in there lost their mama almost the day they were born. And the one thing she was always excited about was making them pizza when they were older. Having them help, passing along the tradition." He shrugged. "I'm all thumbs in the kitchen, at least I was, until your gift. Now I get to fulfill her wishes."

I didn't know what to say, I wasn't much into commiseration. So I nodded and walked away. But I knew I'd be back.

——————

I've forgotten now, how many times I went to the man's house. But this time was different.

I let myself in, knowing the door would be unlocked for 'Uncle Luci.' The house was quiet, and I caught the whiff of an open grave. Death had touched this place recently. But I would have known if it was my contracted soul. So then...

I entered the kitchen to find the man sitting at the table. He looked calm, but it was the calm of a coiled spring. Trying to smooth the worry from my face, I moved to the other side of the table.

"I want to concede." The man's voice was hoarse, as if he'd been screaming.

"You want to give up your soul? But, the girls—"

"They're not here anymore." He cut me off, harsh and angry. But the rage in his eyes was only covering the bone-deep grief. I knew what he was going to say before he said it.

"They died. Car accident, drunk driver. And judging by your surprise, they didn't go to your domain. So you see. There's nothing left anymore. Nothing."

I sat for a moment in silence. Like I said, I don't do commiseration. It's not in my nature. But I felt something close to it; for just a second, felt what it might be like to have pity.

"I don't want to take your soul now." He frowned and I raised a hand before he could say anything. "I like your pizza too much, and dead chefs don't make great pizza. So, we're in a bit of a situation."

"Well, I'm not. I want to give up my soul, and we have a contract. Take it. It's not much use anymore."

I ran through solutions in my head, discarding one after the other. Briefly, I considered asking Upstairs if they could pull some strings, but we were still on the outs, as it were. There had to be something I could do for the man—ah!

I rose, holding out my hand.

"Come. I have a better idea for now."

——————

It had been a few months since that fateful day. I walked through hell, eagerly heading for a small corner.

This corner was different than most of the places here. It really shouldn't have been in Hell, except that there was no other place to put it. As I moved closer, the smell of sulfur faded, grass grew under my feet, the dark umber of the sky turned to bright blue and a large house appeared.

I let myself in, walking quietly as the sounds of the house surrounded me. It always felt strange at first, to leave behind the darkness of Hell to come into a place of practical light. Turning a corner, I entered the giant kitchen, unable to help the small smile that curled my lips.

There was the man who'd gambled his soul for pizza. Busy at one of the many stoves, laughing and smiling. And surrounding him, by the tables, climbing on the counters, digging in the freezers were children.

Children of all shapes and sizes, but none older than seventeen years. This was where the souls of those that died too young came. They didn't go to Heaven or Hell. It was deemed that they should be given a second chance, and so here they waited for reincarnation. And it was here that I'd brought the man when he'd conceded his soul.

He turned, coming forward to meet me, as cries of 'Uncle Luci' rippled through the crowd of children. The nickname seemed to be catching on. As he greeted me, even though he smiled, I could still see the sadness in his eyes. The children here were a healing balm, but the wound would never fully close.

I clasped his arm, drawing him closer as I whispered.

"I've worked out a deal." He raised his eyebrows, a faint hope growing in them. Shooing the children back to their tasks, he pulled me to a corner of the kitchen.

"What deal?"

"You're going to be here for a while yet, possibly millennia. But, when you've worked off the debt of a soul," I shook my head. "Heaven and their fancy language. When you've worked it off, they'll let you come up. They'll reverse the bargain we made. Even I can't do that, even I'm bound by the rules. They, *make* the rules. So, what do you say? You can see the girls again."

The man stared at me as if he couldn't quite believe what I was saying, and I was reminded of that night so long ago at the crossroads. So many things had changed since then, but his look of doubt was still the same.

"Heaven keeps their promises. Take it from someone who knows." I said with only a trace of bitterness. A tear welled in the corner of the man's eye and he quickly dashed it away before any of the children saw.

"I say, yes. Deal." His voice cracked on the last word. I clasped his shoulder, squeezing gently then spun him towards the children. Leaning down, I whispered into his ear.

"Well, then. Get to work." As he moved away from my grasp, I raised my voice, shouting over the general clamour.

"After all, what night is it?" And with a collective roar, that shook the house the children called back.

"Pizza night!"
