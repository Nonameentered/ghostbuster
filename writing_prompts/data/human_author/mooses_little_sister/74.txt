Humming under my breath, I walked to my kitchen, looking forward to my morning coffee. Had I set the machine last night? I couldn't remember doing it, but it was just finishing brewing a fresh pot. Huh. Well, I've never been the best at recollecting all my actions.

A different memory landed like a stone as I opened the fridge. I'm out of cream. Which means I have to use milk, like a *heathen*. I pulled out the milk, my sigh cutting off as I saw what was behind it. A carton of cream. But, I could have sworn that I put that in —I swivelled violently to my recycling bin as if I would catch it in some compromising position. There was no cream carton.

Okay, a little strange, but I probably just *thought* that I'd run out of cream, when in fact I had the perfect amount left. The absolute perfect amount. Making sure I was aware of every move, I put the empty carton in my recycling bin. There. Now I was positive that I had no more cream.

The sugar proved unsuspicious and the rest of breakfast went smoothly. The coffee slowly starting to take effect, I yawned, feeling slightly more awake. Stretching, I walked into my bedroom, planning my outfit for the day. I couldn't wear my favourite shirt, as I'd recently found a tear in the sleeve—

The shirt was on my bed, with the tear gone, very cleverly mended. I took a breath, for a moment seriously considering that I had a case of tiny elves. My cousin was a shoemaker, after all, maybe he'd sent me some. I mean, I tend to be forgetful, but this was getting out of hand. Had I sleep-mended a shirt? And didn't remember putting it on my bed?

But, I didn't live with anyone else, and the idea of elves was ridiculous. So maybe I had repaired the shirt and just forgotten. It did sound like something I would do. Putting the thought out of my mind, I shrugged into the shirt, finishing dressing with a quick brush of fingers through my hair.

Time for a second cup of coffee.

This time, I didn't bother reaching for the milk, instead jumping straight to the Irish cream. Don't judge, this day was starting to get to me. Besides, it was a leftover from Christmas and I wanted to finish it. Is it my fault I only drink coffee in the morning? I emptied the bottle into my coffee. Again the absolute perfect amount. But I knew that there was more in that jar. It should have been half full, at the least...

Again, carefully putting the container into the recycling, I walked outside appreciating the sound of birds. I could only enjoy birdsong during my second coffee. Anything earlier, and I started considering bird poison.

Sipping my coffee, I squinted up at the sky. It was chilly and overcast, it would be nice if the sun— The sky was blue and clear, the sun hovering over the horizon. Huh. Maybe a little bit of shade would be nice—my house grew a porch with a swing chair.

One minute I was standing on concrete, the next I was seated; swinging gently on the chair, with wood boards under my feet. I took another few sips of coffee, frowning. The birds kept singing, and with an errant thought, I turned their volume lower. As I finished the coffee, stopping myself just in time from wishing for more Irish cream, I sighed.

*Something*, was definitely happening here.

And whatever it was, it was probably going to interfere with my plans to garden all day.

Bugger.
