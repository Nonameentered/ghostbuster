"Gather round children." I paused, smiling down at the upturned faces. "Now, some of you have heard the story before, and I expect you to help the younger children with the call and response." There was a general murmur of agreement. Settling back in my chair, I rocked slightly.
  
"There once was a man. He wasn't anyone particularly special, but he liked to take walks. And on his walks, he always took..."
  
"His cat!" 
  
"Now the walks would take him far and wide, sometimes travelling for days, sometimes months. One day, his cat didn't want to go with him. It hid, always moving to a new spot when the man checked the old. Finally, giving up, the man sighed, grabbed his hat and walked out on his own. Without..."
  
"His cat!"
  
"Now the cat was sitting there, feeling very smug at having outwitted the owner that took it on such long walks. It was nice to enjoy the sunshine, and nap however much it wanted to. But in the back of the cat's mind, was the disappointed face of its owner. The way the man sighed and shook his head. And so, the cat went out to join..."
  
"Its owner!"
  
"The man's scent was faint, but the cat followed it faithfully. Up hills, and into valleys, the cat walked. The soft pads on its feet were scratched and bruised, but still, it searched. Its voice was hoarse with calling, but still, it searched. The cat began to regret its mischief in hiding from its owner. After all, when it went on walks with its owner, he would pick up the cat when it got tired. Now there was no one to pick it up. 
  
Finally, the cat came to a strange place. The ground was bare, the rocks were large and spiky. There were strange markings on some of the stones, but the cat did not understand them. But what it did understand, was a sense of danger. Its fur prickled, and as it picked its way across the landscape, it received a shock. The fur on its feet, that had always been black, was now..."
  
"Green!" 
  
"The cat was frightened by this change, but it pressed on. The scent of its owner had changed, growing weaker and sicker. But still, the cat knew it had to find him. The spiky strange rocks rose thicker and thicker, and as the cat wove through them, it was surprised to find that the fur on its feet had now changed to..."
  
"Yellow!" 
  
"The cat grew more afraid, but it continued. After all, if its owner hadn't returned by now, there had to be a reason. Perhaps it was some kind of monster. There! Ahead of the cat, crumpled on the ground, was the shape of its master. The cat yowled and bolted forward. Whatever this strange space had done, whatever monster had hurt its owner, it would face it. It didn't even notice that the fur on its feet was now..."
  
"Red!"
  
"Now the cat reached its owner and licked his face with its sandpaper tongue. The man groaned, stirring. With many falls and stumbles, the cat led the man from the dangerous place. And as they walked further and further out of the spiky rocks, away from the feeling of prickling fur, the cat's colour changed back to its usual black. 
  
It took a few days, but the owner recovered," I paused for the general cheering. "And he sat down and thought it over. He thought about his cat, and about the changing fur, and he realized that his cat could tell him when there were terrible things around. And if his cat's fur changed colour, he should be careful. And he told others. He told everyone, and he even told me." I smiled at the murmurs of disbelief from the children. They didn't have to believe that the original man had told me the story. When they grew old, they would tell the next generation the same thing.
  
"So, now we all know the truth. And what must we remember? If your cat changes colour..."
  
"You must flee!"

"And when we go out on walks, what do we take?"

"Our Cat!"
