I stood, watching the crystal ball as the adventurers approached. A crystal ball didn't give the best view of anything really, but it was traditional and I'd used it for hundreds of years. Besides, equipment upgrades were expensive, and most of my funds were tied up in the dungeon itself.

I'd lost track over the years, of how many adventurers had entered my dungeon, confident and cocky. Most of them never came out, but the ones that did had their confidence destroyed with no cockiness to speak of. I took pride in my near-perfect record, especially around the holidays, when I had themed monsters instead of the regular ones. However, there was one flaw.

One pink raincoated flaw. It was a little girl, couldn't have been older than six or seven years old. She accompanied every party, no matter how big, no matter how small. I'd studied her from every angle, every position I could think of with my crystal ball, but I could never see her face. It was always covered by her hood, or a stray shield or sword from an adventurer. Some parties seemed to see her, moving around her like she was an honoured guest, others never even blinked as she skipped blithely along.

This party, the one I watched didn't seem to notice. Picking up my ball, my joints creaking with the movement, I started down from the observatory. My kind lived long, almost immortal lives, but eventually, like all things we must die. I had noticed the signs in myself only a month ago, and already I knew that I didn't have much time left. This would most likely be the last time I walked down these steps, the last adventuring party I let into my dungeon.

But even if it was the last thing I did, I would find the identity of this seemingly immortal little girl.

Locking the observatory door behind me, I hobbled across the small path to the opening of my dungeon. It was a masterpiece in terror, poison dripping from every surface, the upper part looking like some long-dead beast, the bottom giving the impression of a bottomless pit. Holding my crystal ball in one hand, and leaning on my cane, I waited for the adventurers to arrive.

It wasn't long before I was surrounded by two men with sharp swords, a woman with an arrow pointed at my throat, and a sneaky man trying to get at me with some daggers. I ignored them all. I knew when I was to die, and it wasn't quite yet. There in front of me, the little girl stopped, face still hidden in the shadow of her raincoat.

"Who are you?" My voice cracked, hoarse with centuries of disuse. The people around me shifted uneasily, talking in a language I didn't understand. Perhaps they thought I talked to them. A small hand came up, touching the crystal ball I still held.

"You are the person who watches me." The voice was childlike, completely innocent.

"That is not an answer to my question. Who are you?" I sounded harsh, but I didn't temper my voice. Time was no longer my friend. She cocked her head to the side as if the question didn't make any sense. The adventurers muttered under their breath as if they needed to decide something.

"I am me." It wasn't an answer I wanted, but as she finally pushed her hood back, my legs gave out, sending me to the ground. It couldn't be...

"Serafina. After all this time—" My voice broke. She stared at me accusingly, her small nose wrinkling in a gesture I knew all too well.

"You got old without me. You promised you wouldn't. You said we'd never be apart." Tears formed in the corners of her eyes. "So why didn't you come home?"

The words landed like blows, my heart hurting in my chest. She sniffed, wiping angrily at her face.

"The house... it burnt... there was a fire and you—"

"I waited! I waited for you!"

"You didn't get out! You're dead Serafina! You've been dead for thousands of years!" The people around me shifted backwards as I shouted, weapons that had been lowered now pointed aggressively. Serafina reeled as if I'd hit her, the raincoat rustling with the movement. How could  I have forgotten her favourite item of clothing? How could I have forgotten my dearest friend?

"But I found your dungeon. I found your place of work. Why didn't you come to see me earlier?" Her voice was small. "I started to doubt that it was yours, I thought maybe I was wrong, but I didn't dare leave. Because what if this time you came down? What if this time was the right one?"

My own face was wet, my tears probably the only thing holding back the adventuring party. I knew the answer to her question, knew it, though for thousands of years I hadn't even admitted it to myself. Voice shaking, I answered her.

"I didn't come to see you, because I was afraid. Afraid of what I might find. Afraid that it would be you, afraid that you would hate me for never coming back." The woman beside me, the one with the arrow, made a small noise deep in her throat as if she understood something now. Perhaps she had the ability to translate languages? Around Serafina and me, the weapons dropped, and the adventurers stepped away. I didn't care, I could feel the noose of time slowly tightening around my chest.

"I came now because I have nothing left to lose. My life is ending Sera, I am dying. And in the face of death, fear of rejection doesn't have the same sting." My voice lowered, and I couldn't look her in the eyes.

A small hand reached out, raising my chin. There was nothing but kindness in her face, though her eyes were sad.

"How could I hate you? You are my best friend. Nothing changes that." My heart stopped, pain radiating out of my chest. Time had caught up to me. And staring into my dead friend's eyes, I died.

——————————

The ranger's eyes were wet as she unstrung her bow. In front of her, the old man lay slumped over, the crystal ball still clutched in his hand. Her language translation spell had kicked in late, but she'd gotten the gist of what had been said. Quietly, she turned to the paladin of the group, asking him to look for spirits, and use his magic. He did so, muttering the words under his breath, extending the spell to the entire group. The ranger shifted, scanning the area. And smiled

Walking away from the dungeon, hand in hand, a  little girl in a pink raincoat, and a little boy dressed all in green, laughed together at some sort of joke. As the ranger watched, they faded from view, moving on to whatever the afterlife had in store.

Together.
