It seems that it is an evil spirit, that can possess humans, but perhaps also can make its own form when it needs to. Whatever it is, apparently everyone agrees that it is a malevolent spirit, with no redeeming qualities.  The embodiment of greed, and gluttony. It does say it's often tied strongly to winter, the north, and famine. And as it can never get enough, it is often depicted as a skeletal figure. Whether that figure is a possessed human, or a representation of the actual creature I'm not sure.

Most creatures like this, that are told through legends and stories don't always have a pin downable definition. (Think of all the different versions of vampires for example) 

Also, as a caveat, I am not an Indigenous person, so I could be wildly off the mark.
