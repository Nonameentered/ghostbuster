The title at the moment, is The Prophecy Bureau, but as I'm trying to get traditionally published it may change. I will post updates on the journey, such as getting an agent,  the release day, and such like that on my personal subreddit ( r/Mel_Rose_Writes ) when those things happen. But getting into the traditional publishing world can be difficult and slow. However, no one has ever accused me of not being stubborn. So I'm going to keep querying agents until one says yes. :) Cheers!
