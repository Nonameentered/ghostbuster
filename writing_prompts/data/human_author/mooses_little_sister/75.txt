TW/CW: Death, violence, murder.

&#x200B;

All my life I had tried to avoid needing help. It was the one thing I could never afford. You see, my "fairy godmother" isn't. They aren't a fairy and I have no idea if they're female. Possibly, but there's no way to tell. Everything I needed to know about their way of 'helping' I learned when I was eight years old.

My family was in dire straits, we needed food and shelter. Winter was drawing near, and there would be no surviving without it. It was the first time I'd ever begged for someone to help or save us. And the monster appeared.

They leaned over me, hot breath chasing away the chill in the air. I was too scared to run, the inside of my legs growing suddenly warm as my bladder emptied.

"You need me." Their voice hissed, smooth but at the same time sounding like it scraped over gravel. My knees gave way, and I tumbled to the ground, trying to breathe. The monster smiled, as if it enjoyed my fear.

"I will give your family food and sssshelter. Look." They raised a taloned claw, waving it in the air. I heard screams from the house beside the alley we stood in. Worse than the screams, was the sudden silence that followed.

"That family won't be missed for the time of cold. Your own can live there inssstead. Isssn't that wonderful." It wasn't a question. They expected to be agreed with. Unable to speak, I bobbed my head in a nod. As suddenly as they'd appeared, they vanished, leaving the smell of rot behind.

I'm almost ashamed to say that I told my family of the house the next day. And we were wonderfully warm and well-fed all that winter, though my mother used to complain of the odd smell. The smell of rot, of death. I knew where the odour came from, though I couldn't tell them. Couldn't tell them that my nightmares showed what the monster had done, showed the bodies in the walls of our winter home.

It's been many years now. And I've managed to never need anything that badly again. Never, ever, ever ask for help. I'm not proud of all the things I've done. There have been times I've had to steal, lie, and cause others harm. But one thought gives me solace. I've not called on that monster, not given them licence to kill, or worse than kill, anyone else.

But something happened today. I went to work like usual. Came home, like usual. And the front door was unlocked. I never left it unlocked, and the nanny knew better. Quietly, old instincts kicking in, I took off my shoes, stocking feet padding through the halls. There were marks of violence on the walls, and I read them with the ease of familiarity.

A fight had occurred with my nanny against at least four assailants. She had taken down one of them, with a violent blow to the throat. I knew this because I stepped over his body. My breath started to come in ragged gasps as I reached the nursery.

Her body had been torn to shreds. It looked like an insane wolf had ripped her apart. I said a quiet prayer, and moved around the nanny's remains. It took me five minutes to summon the nerve to look in the crib. There was blood everywhere, but no sign of my little girl.

Frantic now, no longer concerned about stealth, I ran through the house, searching for any place the invaders could have put her. Nothing. I stood in the living room, feeling my skin tighten with rage. They'd taken my daughter.

Need spiralled through me, and reaching with my mind, I screamed for the monster. I wanted something, and by heaven or hell, they were going to help me get it. They appeared, head scraping against the ceiling of the room.

"You need me." This time, I wasn't afraid.

"Yes. I need you to find my daughter and the men that took her." The monster raised a claw, but I wasn't finished. "And I want to watch."

A smile revealing too many teeth split the monster's head in two. They wrapped an arm around my shoulders.

"Thisss will be marvelousss."

There was a shudder of movement, and we were in a darkened room. The only light came through dingy windows. I had enough time to hear one of the men talking about a ransom before the group noticed the monster. Screams sprang from throats. The monster reached out and made an odd twisting motion with their hands.

The men broke, their bones jutting from flesh, the muscles unravelling. Two had their ribcages thrust through their lungs, spiking out their back. Skin sloughed onto the floor, blood and viscera spilling everywhere. A low laugh filled the room and I wasn't sure if it was the monster's or mine. Maybe it was both.

As soon as it started, the killing stopped, and there, in the middle of the room, completely untouched sat my daughter. She was playing with blocks, trying to build a tower, but they were too slippery with blood. I ran forward, snatching her up, holding her close. The monster shifted to my side, looking down at me, then at my little girl.

"Ahh." The sinister voice sounded in my ear. "Another one of your line. I look forward to what requesssts sshe will have for me."

And my monster vanished into the gloom, leaving me surrounded by death, clinging to the only life that mattered anymore.
