"Matthew," I flinched. Whenever my mother called me by my full name I knew there was a problem. Even though I'd moved out years ago, the automatic reaction was to duck and cover. It was no wonder she'd managed to stand up to, and seduce a dragon.

"We love you, and that's why we're here. You have a very serious hoarding problem." Her voice was stern.

"I'm half-dragon Mum. That's how it works. It's literally a part of me. Part of my heritage." She snorted at me, and I saw Silas, my half-sibling bite back a smile.

"Yes, and since your Father," she snarled the word. "Didn't decide to have any hand in raising you, or claiming you as his, you need to function in the human world. And as such, this hoarding thing has to be addressed."

"Yeah, we're worried about it." Silas put in, actually concerned. We'd always gotten along, even though he was much younger. I had been a product of my mother's wilder days, he was the child she'd had when she settled down.

"Look, I'm not hurting anyone. I keep my things orderly, there's nothing dangerous—"

"But look around you. Eventually, you're going to run out of room in this place, and it will be dangerous." She said. I smiled around the room, feeling the pride in the collection; the fierce desire to protect it at all costs. But I loved my mother, and I knew she was worried. More than that, I knew she was right. What I collected would get dangerous if I kept it too long in this place, if I ran out of room to properly store it.

"Well, what do you suggest? I won't get rid of it." I said, my voice dipping towards a slightly more feral growl. She raised an eyebrow at me.

"I never thought that for a second. Here's the plan..."

I strode through the large building, smiling to myself. My collection covered the walls, rose from the floor, and even hung from the ceiling. I revelled in the peace of the main area before we opened for business. It was the grand opening gala tonight, and though this part of the plan made me nervous, I had agreed.

The night drew on, and I stood in front of a large crowd. Down in the front, my mother and Silas were smiling with encouragement. From the podium, I raised my voice, into a loud roar, another bit of dragon heritage.

"Welcome! One and all! To the Museum of Medieval Weaponry and Art. If you touch anything I'll burn you to a crisp." I paused, then chuckled at the faces. "Just my little joke. Come in and enjoy."

As the doors swung open, I smiled. Sometimes, mothers did know best. This was the healthiest way to exercise my hoarding habit, for what was the purpose of a museum but to conserve, protect and teach?

I met my family as the crowd flowed through the doors, and Mum gave me a giant hug.

"Well done Matt. I'm proud of you."

And those words were better than any collection could ever be.
