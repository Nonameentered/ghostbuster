I reached the impact site first, setting up camp a safe distance away. The other idiots would be here soon, and knowing them, I and my services would make some serious bank today. Humming to myself, I puttered around the tent until a voice came from outside.

"Hey, Trev, you in there?"

I popped my head out, squinting in the early morning sunlight. Rising in front of me, standing in what you would typically call a 'heroic' pose was the first person to arrive. As usual, a villain had made it here first.

"Yep. What can I do for you mate? The heroes ain't here yet so—"

"Goodness, no. I don't need your services, I was just wondering if you wanted some coffee." Coffee sounded wonderful, and soon we sat on lawn chairs, sipping our warm beverages.

"So you heard the news too, Alan." Another figure loomed over us, nearly blocking out the light.

"Yes." Alan held his coffee as if he would throw it at the new arrival. I raised my hands, knowing I would need to remind them of the treaty.

"Guys. Remember, when you're anywhere near me—"

"Yeah, yeah Trev. We know." Alan waved a hand. "Come and sit down then, Steve. I'm sure we can scrape some more coffee together for you."

All through the morning, more and more villains arrived. Soon I had enough to start my own football team, and was seriously considering going into that business when the superheroes turned up. Thumping into the dirt, capes billowing in a wind that had not existed before, they strode toward us.

"We're going to destroy that meteor before it lands and there's nothing you can do to stop us!" Their leader called out. I shook my head, as Alan shouted back. I try not to discriminate, but sometimes the heroes could be rather stupid.

"Stop you? We're here to help! We live on this planet too, dumbass."

"Alan. Language." I muttered under my breath, and he turned a little pink. The leader of the heroes arrived, trying to tower over us. With Steve standing behind, the only thing the hero achieved was looking small.

"You're going to help? Why?" The leader squinted at us in disbelief. Then took a very obvious double take at my presence.

"Trev? What are you doing with all these... villains." He made the word a curse. I rolled my eyes.

"Must I remind everyone? I'm not on anyone's side, no one gets any special treatment, and I'm here to help. For a small fee, of course." The hero frowned but dismissed me with a gesture. I wandered away from the group, as I knew what would happen next. Alan would forget himself and start cursing the hero out, the hero would get frustrated, and they'd get into a pissing match on who was actually the most powerful, yada, yada, yada. Then, when everything seemed like it was going to go to absolute shit, with the meteor bearing down on us, they'd pull together and fend off the problem. I'd seen it before, though not with this particular group of heroes and villains.

I ducked into my tent, looking over both my supplies and my power levels. From outside, I heard shouting, and then a strange rumbling sound. There we go. They've started working together, and the meteor will soon be dealt with. A few minutes later, a chunk of rock obliterated my tent, pinning my bottom half to the ground. Huh. Not quite the safe distance I'd thought.

Drumming my fingers on the ground, I waited. Finally, one of the heroes pulled the rock off me. He was the first in a long line of slightly wounded heroes and more wounded villains. I rolled up my sleeves and sighed.

"All right, you know the drill, everyone in order of severity. This is triage people, not a popularity contest. And have your credit cards ready please." As they rearranged themselves, I smiled.

Being an immortal healer had its fair share of annoyances. But it  definitely had its benefits too.
