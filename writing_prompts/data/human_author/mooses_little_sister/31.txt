Once, very long ago, when the world was young and magic still roamed free, there were three people. Solena burned bright and hot and danced with all the passion of her heart. Lune was cooler and smaller, but still full of joy and delight. The third person had no name; they were only described by their lack. No light, no fire, nothing but Darkness.
  
Lune met Solena and they fell in love. They danced endlessly over the world, and everyone was cheered by their presence. Darkness also loved to see the two dance, and followed them in all their travels. As time progressed, Darkness couldn't help but fall hopelessly in love with both Lune and Solena. But the two didn't even notice the Darkness, locked as they were in each other's embrace. So Darkness kept following them, growing ever more sad, ever more fond, ever more loving.
  
Until one day, the Darkness noticed the age spots on Solena's hands, the wrinkles that played at the corners of Lune's eyes. Until Darkness felt their own age, in sore joints and their energy failing. And though the two still danced with joy and fire, Darkness mourned, because they knew that Death, the end of all things would reach for the people the Darkness loved most, and take them away.
  
And Darkness could not bear that.
  
So they reached deep into themselves, deep into the world, deep into the magic that roamed its surface. The power permeated every inch of the Darkness, changing them; pushing them into a new shape. And with shaking hands, the Darkness stretched out and for the very first time, touched Solena and Lune, sharing the magic. 
  
Their forms began to shift as they danced, growing and changing. Their light and fire burned, searing into the Darkness, causing small flecks of themselves to detach and spin through the air. Unable to bear the thought of losing any part of their loved ones, the Darkness expanded, catching every fleck in their body, holding them suspended. 
  
Solena and Lune, no longer able to keep themselves together, their new bodies beginning to float apart, started to cry. The Darkness cried with them, reaching, wrapping around them, and holding them in place. But Darkness knew this wasn't the answer. Solena and Lune needed to dance; they needed that motion. And so the Darkness changed again. 
  
They became nothing, or almost nothing, so that Solena and Lune could dance through them, could move in an eternal, everlasting dance. The couple's sobs turned to laughter, and they shifted, moving ceaselessly in the Darkness. And softly — holding the flecks that had become stars— another voice joined the laughter. Another figure finally became part of the dance. The Darkness danced subtly, danced quietly, but danced all the same.
  
So child, when you see the Sun, the Moon and all the Stars, don't forget. Don't forget to thank the Darkness. For if it wasn't for the Darkness, if it wasn't for their love, the world would be a cold and joyless place, with Solena and Lune forever lost.
