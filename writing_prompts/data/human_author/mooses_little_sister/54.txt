Space isn't so bad. It's dark, which is nice. I didn't expect to be stuck *here* when I told Gris I needed a little space, but there you go. You have to be very careful what you say to a wizard when he's in a bad mood. Very careful.

So, here I am, floating amongst the tiny little space rocks, bored out of my skull. And also, hungry. There aren't many opportunities to eat out here. The only reason I'm alive at all, is Gris decided it would be funny to cast a breathing spell. This means the vacuum of space doesn't kill me, just slowly drives me insane with the quiet.

There's a bit of silver off to my left, maybe it's a spaceship. They are my only hope of getting back to Earth, or any civilization really. But this one will make three hundred I've seen and hoped to get close enough to knock. I don't have any means of propulsion you see. If it does get close enough, hopefully, the crew won't be very superstitious. After all, I may be a vampire, but I'm not a *monster.* I can control myself. Temporarily.

Oh, glory be. The ship is close. If I stretch, I should be able to reach... Got it. I wonder if they'll even hear my knock over the roar of their engines. Goddess save me, they're loud. Maybe I should try shouting.

"Hello! Can I come in? I'm very bored and hungry out here!" Huh, my voice actually made noise. But it shouldn't, and why *can* I hear their engines? We're in space. Am I breathing easier? Fresh air? Have I finally lost my mind?

The door swung open, and a small humanoid creature stared up at me. It piped in a high-pitched voice.

"Hello, Mister! Whatcha doing out there?" They asked. My eye twitched.

"Oh, you know, just having a bit of a stroll round the solar system. Say, do you think I could come inside? It's a bit chilly out here." The human—it was definitely human, I could smell the blood— put their head to the side.

"I suppose..." That answer wasn't good enough. I needed emphatic.

"Is that a 'yes'?" I said hopefully.

"Yeah. You can come in."

I grasped the outstretched hand, pulling myself inside with enough strength to bowl the small human over. Instead of being angry, they giggled. It had been a long time, but I knew that reaction. This was a kid. A child. What in the Goddess's name was a child doing opening doors on a spaceship? I asked the question in a roundabout way, trying not to imply that the child was in any way insufficient as a host.

"Oh, we're all pretty young here. It's kind of a prerequisite. After all, a lot of the Galactic Laws only apply to adults." The child grinned at me, a smile almost as feral as my own. "When you're a kid, you can get away with a lot of stuff. Welcome to The Neverland."

I wasn't sure what to say, but as I followed the kid through the corridors of the ship, I gleaned an idea of what he might mean. Hanging from every surface, practically dripping gilt, was loads of stolen merchandise. I recognized some of the valuables from my own time, but others seemed like bits of junk. This was a pirate ship. Crewed by children.

I grinned as I secured passage aboard. While I had a rule— no feeding on children— I had a feeling that wouldn't be too much of a problem. After all, I had no such restrictions for any ship and crew we might attack on our way.

When I got back home I wasn't sure if I was going to kill the estimable wizard Gris or kiss him.

But at least it would be an interesting journey.
