"Now, Mr. and Mrs. Slightman, I have the perfect place for you. If you would look at these photos." I turned my screen so the couple in front of me could see better. They leaned forward, and I tried not to flinch at the smell of garlic that wafted from them both. I knew my appearance often made people reach for their cloves and crosses, but trust me. I am not a vampire. I am simply... iron deficient. 
  
"You see, plenty of space for the kiddies to run about in, an enchanting indoor lake, completely crocodile-free and for you Mr. Slightman," I enlarged a picture. "A fully functioning workshop, complete with some interesting wall stains and a wonderful extending table." I smiled at them, making sure to keep my lips closed. My teeth were disturbing to some people. Mrs. Slightman looked doubtful, and reaching with a manicured finger, tapped the bigger image. 
  
"Isn't that a torture room? And a torture device?" She asked. Fully expecting the question, I waved a dismissive hand. 
  
"Oh, that might be what the previous owner used it for, but a workroom is a workroom. I'm sure you wouldn't be torturing people in there, would you? No, I don't think so. Now, for you Mrs. Slightman I draw your attention to this." I pulled another image onto the screen. Mrs. Slightman gasped in delight, and her heart rate jumped. I took a slightly deeper breath, ignoring Mr. Slightman's frown. She smelled deli— No. I was getting distracted. 
  
"Are those..." Trailing off, she looked at me questioningly. I smiled again, the tips of my teeth just visible. Mr. Slightman rubbed his garlic, but held his peace. 
  
"Yes indeed, Mrs. Slightman, they are. A perfect set in fact. Unfortunately, they are bolted to the floor, and to remove them..." I shook my head. "It would be impossible. However, if you purchased the place..." Leaving the words hanging, I raised my eyebrows at her, including Mr. Slightman with a slight incline of my head. I was close, I could smell it. 
  
"We need a viewing first." Mr. Slightman barked, breaking the thick silence. I nodded, giving him the full benefit of my smile. He flinched. 
  
"Of course. I wouldn't have it any other way. Shall we say Tuesday?"

The dark walls rose in front of us, stained with a substance that even the strongest cleaning spells wouldn't remove. I had simply changed the description from granite to obsidian and the Slightmans hadn't even questioned it. 
  
"Shall we?" I motioned them inside, through gates that opened like butter. The Slightmans, having updated their wardrobe to include both garlic and crosses walked through looking about. 
  
"Your very own courtyard, easily modified to put in a pool, or other entertainment." 
  
"Yes, but that tree looks a little ominous..." Mr. Slightman pointed to the far wall, where a dead tree was inexplicably still growing taller. A side effect of the magic used here before. 
  
"Oh, that? That's part of the security system. Anyone tries and climbs in over that wall and, well," I paused, making sure they were both looking at me. "You don't have to call any police, if you get my drift."
  
They got it. I directed them inside, guiding them through the castle. Mrs. Slightman seemed enamoured with everything, but especially the furniture. Genuine antiques she called them. I didn't see fit to tell her that those genuine antiques had some very questionable viscera on them when I'd last been here. On those, the cleaning spells had worked a treat. 
  
We ended the tour in the kitchens, and I raised my eyebrows. 
  
"Well, do we have a verdict or do we need more time? I should remind you that there are a few other realtors that have clients interested in this place." A blatant lie, but they didn't need to know that. Mr. Slightman sniffed, then with a puzzled expression, sniffed again. 
  
"What is that smell?" He asked. I smiled, opening the oven door and creating a bit of a draft. 
  
"Oh, it's just an apple pie. I always like to make it feel homey in every place I sell." I knew perfectly well that he hadn't been smelling that, and was most likely talking about the smell from the closed-off dungeons. Cleaning spells aren't perfect you know. 
  
He frowned but dropped the topic. Turning to his wife, they had a whispered conversation, in which I heard every word. My ears tend to be quite sensitive.
  
"We'll take it. But for no more than 500,000." He said, looking back at me. I smiled, feeling the thrill of a sale closing in. It was like the thrill of the hunt, the feel of blood— No. I'm getting distracted again. 
  
"Marvelous. I believe the owner would be amenable to that price, even though it is a bit below their asking." The owner, of course, was dead, but that was no obstacle. I had ways of making him agree. We shook hands on the deal, and I watched them drive away, excited about their new home. I smiled, as I locked the gates again.
  
Real Estate might not be as exciting as Vampirism, but it was the next best thing.
