The door creaked threateningly as I went inside, but that was the only indication my life was about to change. I'd paid professional movers to get all my stuff inside and put it in place, and now all there was left to do was set up the wifi and cable. But it had been a long day moving across the entire city, and all I really wanted to do was curl up and take a nap. And the couch looked so inviting...
  
I wasn't sure what time it was when I woke, but the daylight was starting to fade. Stretching luxuriously, I opened my eyes to a skull. Screaming in a pitch I'd only thought possible for dog whistles, I swatted whatever was on my chest across the room. It hit the wall and tumbled to the floor with a strange clattering noise. I had time to see a pile of small whiteish-yellow bones before it reformed into a skeleton. 
  
A quadruped, that much was obvious, and from how it sat, with its tail bones curled around its front legs... maybe a cat? I noticed the size of the skeleton and revised my opinion. A kitten. Instantly feeling bad for my violent reaction, I pspspsed at it, trying to make myself seem friendly. To my surprise, it trotted right over, putting its head under my hand, and rubbing happily. 
  
The ridiculousness of the situation wasn't lost on me, but it didn't stop me from telling the skeleton it was a good kitty. There was no purring, but I got a strong tingling sensation up my spine, that perhaps was the same thing. 
  
"Are there any more of you?" My voice sounded strange in the house, tiny in a cavernous space. I wasn't even sure if the kitten understood, but it moved to the door, before looking over its shoulder as if to say 'you coming?'  Well, as they say, in for a penny, in for a pound. 
  
I got up, making sure my knees didn't give out as they were prone to do. 
  
"All right. Lead on Mcduff." The kitten moved swiftly, but still with the unsteadiness that you expected from a young cat. It was oddly endearing, and I found myself enjoying this strange dream. It had to be a dream, one where you think you've woken up, but really you haven't. I used to hate those, especially in the morning. 
  
The kitten led me down into the unfinished basement that reminded me of an old cave. It was the one thing I hadn't liked about the house, but I figured I could turn it into a cool storm shelter, though we didn't have many gales in this part of the country. I found myself wishing I had a flashlight, but the kitten kept moving confidently towards a ratty curtain hung against the wall. It slipped underneath it and instead of making a bulge like it should have— filling whatever space between the curtain and the wall—it disappeared.
  
Taking a deep breath, and reminding myself this had to be a dream, I pulled the curtain aside, to reveal a dark tunnel, stretching out of sight. Right in front of me, the kitten stared up sitting once more in its enigmatic position. I nodded to it, but it simply cocked its head to the side. Was this as far as it knew to go? Or was it looking beside me... I followed the gaze, turning to the left. There, in a bracket that must have come from the medieval ages, sat a torch. Digging into my pockets, I found my father's lighter that he'd given to me before I moved. Within seconds I had the torch lit and was following the cat down the tunnel.
  
It wasn't as far as I expected, shortly opening out into an actual cave. I raised the torch high, as the kitten dashed towards a corner. Whitish-yellow bones lay piled everywhere, none actually in a coherent form. A small tapping sound drew my attention and I went in the direction the kitten had dashed. It was laying with its nose pointed toward another small pile of bones. The tapping was from it trying to get the pile to wake up. I looked around the cave again. If all these bones had once been animated, perhaps whatever spell had given them life was wearing off. The kitten was the last still awake.
  
Staring down at the little form nosing at the pile of bones, I sighed. Poor thing. Leaving it behind, I prowled around the edges of the cave, before stumbling upon an alcove. There, lit by the flickering torchlight, were three large tomes. Stacking them precariously in one arm, I left the cave, with the kitten following at my heels and made my way upstairs once again. I had studying to do.
  
——————
  
It took a few months, during which I finally accepted this wasn't a dream, but my new reality and got used to having a skeletal kitten wandering around the house. At least it was easier to take care of than a regular cat. Finally, I finished studying, the final words of the last tome echoing in my head.
  
'Beware Necromancer, what you raise, for the dead have a way of settling old scores.' I wonder if that warning was why the old occupant of this house had stuck to animals. Judging by the remains in the cave, they'd never tried humans, or at least never kept them around. 
  
Getting the requisite ingredients was less difficult than I'd imagined, a lot of substitutions had been written in a rough hand in the back of one of the books. The kitten ran around my feet as I walked back downstairs to the cave, ingredients in a bag and the books held carefully in my arms. 
  
It was time.
  
I set up the ritual in the center of the cave, smiling at the tallow splatters from the old Necromancer's own rituals. The words rolled one after the other off my tongue, and a similar tingle to what I'd first experienced with the kitten ran up my spine. I didn't know if this was going to work, but it was worth a shot. With a final flourish, and a shouted syllable, the candle flames guttered before springing back up, bright white. Each one rivalled the sun, and the entire cave lit. Above my head, previously unseen crystals sparkled in the light, reflecting and refracting it into myriad rainbows. As the rainbows touched the piles of bones, they started to shake. Slowly, they rose from the ground, snapping into place, assembling into cat skeletons, dog skeletons, a turtle —which was a bit of a surprise— and a variety of hamsters, chinchillas, and other small rodents. 
  
From the corner, where the small kitten had first led me, a larger cat skeleton came strutting out, going straight towards the kitten at my feet. Their reunion was joyous, and the cat started a cleaning motion to the kitten. My face was wet, as I watched the animal skeletons gambol around the cavern. They had a second life, or was it a third? It didn't matter. They were happy, and that was quite enough.
  
A small movement in the corner of the cave caught my attention. There, almost invisible, a translucent figure stood. He was dressed in old-fashioned garments, and a large smile split his face as he looked around the cave. It had to be the old Necromancer. His gaze rose to mine, and he made a little bow, mouthing two words before he faded away.
  
"Thank you."
