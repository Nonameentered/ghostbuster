Humming under my breath, I waved the duster over the control panel. I'd dusted it yesterday, but there wasn't much to do around here nowadays. Not like the before times, the glory days. I don't really know why I lingered in the old lair. It was familiar I suppose, and someone had to take care of the place. Besides, I didn't have to pay rent, and most of my wants could be taken care of through online shopping.

I set the duster down on the corner of the control panel, flipping a few switches and turning a knob. Music blasted out of the intercom system, loud and pounding. Forcing my aging joints to obey, I danced around the open space with a mop, making sure I didn't step on whatever floor I made wet. Finally mopping myself into a corner, I hopped onto the table I'd backed into and cleaned the small patch of floor where I'd last stood.

This, of course, was the time the old perimeter sensors decided to go off. My music cut out, as an automated voice warned that there was movement in the cove area. I wasn't expecting a delivery today, and besides, they didn't normally come in from that part of the sea. They used the tidal bridge, and we were in the middle of a high tide at the moment. Staring down at my nice clean floor, I sighed.

Reluctantly I got off the table, walking to the bank of video screens. Flicking through the feeds, I fully expected to see a seagull somewhere, pecking at a sensor. It had happened twice before. My screens were seagull-less. However, there was movement down there, and my heart leaped. Perhaps someone had come to take up the cause again.

As I watched, the person—for it was definitely human shaped— picked their way up the cliffs, finding the steep switchbacked path. Keeping an eye on their movements, I turned off the alarm, flinched as the music roared again, and quickly turned the knob to a more manageable level. The person on the cliff had stopped, looking up at my building. I hmphed under my breath. The music hadn't been that loud, had it?

As the entrance door swung open, I realized in a sort of panic that the duster and mop were still visible. What kind of impression would it make if—Dang it. The person stood in the doorway, amusement evident on their face. I shook the mop I'd just grabbed towards them.

"And what are you laughing at sonny?"  The sound of my own voice shocked me. I sounded old...

"Well, this wasn't what I expected."

"And what did you expect, sunshine and roses?" I couldn't keep the crabby sound out of my voice. He was obviously not here to become another supervillain.

"No... But I did expect this place to be run-down ruins. See when my dad died, he wasn't here anymore to take care of it—"

"Your dad?" My world started to tilt on its axis.

"Yeah, my dad. The Great Auxilium. He died when I was just a baby, so I never really knew him. I mean obviously, he was a bad dude—"

"Your father was a great man!" I waved the mop at him again. I would not hear the Boss denigrated by this whelp. The man in front of me stopped, staring at me with a strange expression on his face. He looked around the room as if really seeing it for the first time.

"You worked for him? You were a henchman?" He sounded incredulous.

"*Henchwoman,* yes. I don't suppose you're here to continue the family business?" I asked, picking up the duster and hooking it to the side of my mop bucket. As he entered the room, I shifted, keeping the bucket in between me and him.

"No, not really. I don't have the flair to be a supervillain. And there isn't much call for it anymore. The corporations are doing too good of a job ruining everything themselves. But what can you do." He shrugged apathetically. I offered a prayer of thanks to whatever deity that his father couldn't see him right now. An apathetic son would have driven him insane.

"You can fight." I raised my mop. "If you don't like something, do something about it. That's what your father did."

"My dad was a supervillain. A bad guy." I pursed my lips together, stalking across my ruined floor to the control panel. Typing in a few commands, I called up the presentation I'd put together in my first few years here.

"Look, I'm sorry if I offended you, but—"

"Shut up and watch." I interrupted the apathetic son, pointing at the screens. He frowned at me, but turned.

The screens lit up with scenes. His father at different factories blowing up the tree cutting machines. Destroying buildings, but directing the rubble so it diverted a flooding river away from the fleeing families. Breaking into a bank, and using the money to fund schools in a different country. Over and over, on each of the screens, all the things he did played out.

The man in front of me stumbled back, legs hitting the table as he used it for support.

"But he was a bad guy. He was *bad*."

"But he did *good* too. Listen to me, sonny boy. No one, not your dad, not you, not me. No one is just one thing. He was a supervillain, he destroyed stuff, he hurt people and I ain't completely proud of that. But he got stuff done. He saw what needed doing, and he did it."

The young man looked at me, completely lost. I should have felt sorry for him, but I didn't. He needed a slap upside the head in my opinion and it should have been done long ago.

"Look. You've inherited this place. You've inherited his money. And the question is boy. What the heck are you going to do with it?" His eyes moved from me to the screens and then back to me.

"Were you really a henchwoman?"  I huffed at him, annoyed.

"No. I was the bleeding janitor, all right? But I still worked for arguably the best supervillain out there." A smile twitched at his lips and he straightened, new resolve forming in his face.

"You asked what I'm going to do? Well, I'll tell you. I'm going to do *something*." His smile faltered a little. "But I wasn't lying about the flair. I don't have much style."

I grinned at him and turning my music a little louder, I climbed onto the table, spinning the mop.

"Well, sonny, that's where I come in. I worked for the best of the best after all."
