The sword in the stone. Everyone and their mother knew the story of the sword in the stone. It was ridiculous, that a system of government should be decided by what scrawny child could draw a sword out of a stone. And that wasn't even the worst problem. No, the worst of it was that there were a sight too many swords in stone.
  
Here's what I mean. You have a kingdom, a king and land all the usual stuff. Now, oops the king's dead and there's no heir. Then, often on the very next day a sword and stone appears. Just thumps down into the middle of everything, and everyone runs around trying to find the person who can pull the sword out, who is destined to rule. It's rather annoying, takes all the peace and quiet out of life. Multiply that by however many kingdoms in the world you live in and there's a lot of nonsense happening.
  
Like just recently, our king died, "by accident" and sure enough, a sword and a stone appeared. Not in the very center of town, where it would be much more accessible, no it materialized right outside my blooming house. Right in my front yard. On top of my fountain, crushing it to bits. I was proud of that fountain, it was one of the first things I'd ever carved. A curse on all swords in stone. 
  
It took all of three seconds before the first claimant showed up. I honestly think that they must have had spies watching the entire town. After an hour of grunting, sweating and some very inventive curses, they left. So it went for the rest of the day. There were lineups around the block at some points. Finally, late into the night, everyone went away. And I got to work. 
  
The humans all believed that they needed to draw the sword from the stone. That was a bit ridiculous, and I never quite knew how that got worked into the story. Every dwarf knew the proper answer was to mine the sword out. That was how you normally got metal out of a rock; though there were a few more steps when it was in its raw state. 
  
So with pick and chisel, with a hammer and my own brute strength, I would have this sword out easily tonight. And tomorrow, I might actually be able to have my usual midday nap. I worked quickly, but as quietly as possible. But not quiet enough. As I was close to finishing, a small voice piped up from the other side of the rock. 
  
"Whatcha doing?" 
  
I nearly used one of the curses from the first claimant as I dropped my hammer onto my toe. Around the corner of the stone, a short figure materialized, holding a lantern to light their path. My eyes, accustomed to the dark, smarted at the sudden shift. It was a human child, that much was obvious by their short stature, and lack of beard. Though I suppose it could be an adult human female, they don't grow beards either. An odd oversight of genetics I suppose.
  
"I'm getting rid of this fu— bloody sword. I will have no peace until it's gone." I growled, trying to sound fierce. The child didn't flinch. Brave or stupid, I couldn't tell. 
  
"But everyone will come looking for it. They won't stop until they know who is supposed to be king. Do you want to be king?" They asked.
  
"Do you?" The admittedly childish rejoinder jumped out of me before I could stop it. But instead of sticking out their tongue, or giving an equally silly answer, the child tilted their head to the side. As they thought, I continued my work chipping away at the rock. 
  
"No. Too much power. But I do want a sword. And if you aren't doing anything with that one..." I couldn't help the chuckle that came out of me at their words. Opportunistic little bastard this one. A bit like me, when I was young. 
  
"You'd like this sword, but you don't want to be king. Then you're going to have to leave this kingdom. Are you prepared to do that?" I looked up as I asked the question, my hands still working their repetitive motion. They stilled at the expression on the child's face. It was sheer pain, so fast I couldn't swear to have seen it. But I knew what that expression denoted, knew that if I saw the child in the daylight I would see the bruises, see the malnutrition, see everything the darkness hid. 
  
"Yes. There's nothing for me here." Their voice quavered but held strong at the end. Against my better judgment, I found myself liking this kid. I nodded at them and began chipping away at the stone again. Before another hour passed, I freed the sword from the stone. Hefting it, I could see the workmanship. It was a good sword, serviceable and not too ornate. The child drew closer, and I handed it to them. 
  
The tip plowed into the earth instantly. They had never been trained, didn't have any muscle mass, nothing. Besides, it was a sword for a grown man, not a scrawny kid. They looked at me, eyes full of defiance as if they expected to me to take the sword back. I shook my head.
  
"Wait here." I moved back into my house, taking stock of supplies, and throwing things into a rucksack. I wasn't sure what human children needed nutritionally, but if it was good enough for dwarves, hopefully, it would be good enough for them. I walked out, slamming the door behind me, hearing the levered bar fall into place, locking the house. The child, by some feat of strength, lifted the sword, pointing a quavering tip at me. 
  
"Don't be ridiculous," I said, moving around them and liberating the sword from their grasp. Swinging it onto my back, I went to the front gate. The child made a small sound, somewhere between a cry and a shout. I looked back at the tiny figure standing in their little pool of light.
  
"Well? You coming or what? We're going to need to leave now if we don't want people to suspect. Shake a leg, kid." I couldn't keep the gruffness out of my voice, the child would just have to get used to how I spoke. A gamut of emotions ran across their face before they ran up to me.
  
"You mean— You're coming with me?" The hope in their voice broke my old heart just a bit.
  
"Of course I am," I growled. "You can hardly go alone, can you? Little defenceless child like you. Now come on. We're losing the night." 
  
They followed me, a smile on their face, perhaps the first genuinely happy emotion I'd seen from them this night. We walked in silence until we left the town far behind us. Then, as is common with children, they asked a question.
  
"Where are we going?"
  
"We're going to see a cousin of mine. A blacksmith by trade. He's always been the more adventurous one and he'll know what to do about you and this sword." I said, as the child looked at me worriedly. Shaking my head, I patted them on the head. 
  
"Don't you worry kid. They're a lot nicer than me. Remind me to tell you about the time they met and helped the spirit of a volcano. It's a corker of a story." The child nodded, worries assuaged for now. As we moved through the night, the moon and a single lamp lighting our way, I sighed.
  
I probably wasn't going to be getting my midday nap for a long time.
