I couldn't sleep. It was silly, I knew that but I swore I could hear a tap dripping somewhere. Rolling to the edge of my bunk, I looked down. Below me, Dex —my roommate— was snoring slightly. He'd returned earlier today covered in mud and babbling about things in the ground. It had ended with a shower and him swearing off shoes entirely. I don't know how he'll go about that in the winter, but hopefully, I will be able to watch.

There it was again. A steady drip, drip, drip. If I didn't do something about it soon, I would go insane just listening to it. Lowering myself off the top bunk, I padded to the door, turning the knob as quietly as possible. Dex snored behind me as I slipped into the corridor. The stone walls were damp, slick with water, and I shuddered. It was one of those nights when the walls became cold too fast. But the condensation wasn't dripping.

I moved down the hall, my stocking feet making no noise. When I reached the bathroom, I sighed. That was definitely where the dripping was coming from, but the door was open. That meant the janitor was probably already inside fixing the problem. According to the fourth rule, we weren't supposed to enter a bathroom with a dripping tap. We were to contact the janitor. But he'd apparently gotten here first. Just to satisfy my curiosity, I put my head through the door. The rest of my body followed without permission.

The janitor wasn't there. The bathroom wasn't there. I floated in water, yet somehow I could breathe. Around me, silver sparkles danced in the liquid like dust motes in a ray of sunshine. I swam forward, and tiny rainbow fish darted through the water, playing around my fingers. Unable to resist, I captured one in my hands and brought it closer to my face. It swam around the tiny prison my palms made, before looking up at me and winking.

Shocked, I let it go and raised my eyes. I was no longer alone. In front of me, an ethereal being floated. Not quite human, not quite fish, and definitely not a mermaid. At least not the ones you read about in stories.

"Are you the one?" The voice reached my ears, but it shouldn't have. Sound needs air to travel properly doesn't it? It was a sad voice, with a genuine longing threaded inside. I nearly nodded before I could stop myself.

"The one for what?" I said, my own words sounding strange, but still understandable. The face changed, looking sadder.

"If you are not the one, you will have to leave." It was a pronouncement of judgement, an absolute fact. And I knew at that moment that I had to be the one. How could I not be? I never wanted to leave this place, this beautiful underwater world. I had to be the one. Had to be. I didn't want to leave.

"I'm—"

"SHUT UP!" The gruff shout came from behind me, back where the door to the bathroom should be. It was the janitor, and I knew he would be reaching for me. But I didn't want to leave. I raised my voice louder.

"I'm the one!"

"Shit!"

"Good, then take my hand." The ethereal being reached out, the too-long fingers scattering silver sparkles. I stretched for it, trying to swim forward. But something held me back.

The janitor had grabbed the back of my pyjama shirt. I grabbed for the buttons, fumbling with them, needing to remove the shirt, needing to grasp the hand.

"It's a trick, boy. Close your eyes, get your head on straight. Stop fighting me!" As the janitor spoke, I started moving in reverse. He was pulling me back, back to that boring life in the air, and not underwater. Back to a world with nothing interesting, nothing important. I struggled, but it was as if I had no strength.

Finally, with a sucking squelch, we popped free of the bathroom. The janitor slammed the door shut, instantly attacking my face with a towel. He particularly swiped at my eyes and the rough terrycloth scraped across my eyelids.

"Ow,  what was that for, I was the—wait..." I opened my eyes and looked up at the man. "What... what just happened?"

He smiled, a big sigh escaping from his lips. Relaxing he put his towel away before responding.

"It's a trap that attacks your vision, boy. It shows you something beautiful, something wonderful. For some reason, it needs you to believe the illusion before it takes you. But all the time it's waiting to pounce. Waiting there in that water that isn't water. And if you'd taken that hand..." He paused shaking his head. "Here, I'll show you. Carefully."

He swung the door wide, and  I scrabbled backwards until my back hit the wall. Shaking his head, he gestured towards the bathroom.

"It can't get you unless you go in. Look. The charm doesn't work in the air." I stared at the water, his words echoing in my head. Charm, trick, glamour. It had felt so real. The water was still clear with silver sparkles. But floating just out of reach...

A large humanoid creature was there. Giant teeth protruded from the mouth, the hands webbed claws the size of my forearm. The mouth gnashed in frustration as it turned to swim away. I swallowed, as the janitor swung the door shut.

"Now that you've seen a nightmare in real life, I suggest you go back to your bed and dream some of your own. And stay out of the bathrooms tonight if you can help it. She's hungry. I can feel it." He raised his bucket and I started for my room.  As I slipped into my bed, still shivering from the encounter, I knew I wouldn't sleep well tonight.

After all, I now understood why the school employed a blind janitor.
