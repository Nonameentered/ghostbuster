"You've got an *elf* with you?" The would-be thief trembled in the circle of firelight. I smiled at Tiron who sat across from me. His pointed ears easily gave him away, especially with his short hair. Shaking my own hair forward, making sure my ears were covered, I turned the smile onto the thief. 
  
"Yes. And you know what kind of reputation they have. So I suggest you run, or otherwise make yourself scarce." I said. The thief shook some more before an acrid smell rose around the campsite. Damn. He'd done the one thing I'd hoped he wouldn't. 
  
"And on your way, find a river and clean yourself up. Now git, or I'll sic the elf on you!" Finally, the thief ran, instantly swallowed up by the dark. Tiron sighed. 
  
"You know he probably has a whole gang out there right? And if they're stupid enough they'll decide that two travellers are easy meat even if one of them is an elf." He said. I pulled my dagger out of my boot, cutting a few pieces off an apple. Tossing them to him, I swallowed the rest of it whole. 
  
"Aye, I'm aware of it. But I do like a good fight. Almost as much as I like apples," I turned the sack next to me upside down. Nothing. "And I'm all out of apples." Tiron grinned, the smile of a predatory shark. 
  
"Well then, shall we go?" He asked.

Tiron had been right. The thieves were in a gang, a fairly large one. Leaving our campsite unattended with the fire still burning, Tiron and I had crept through the underbrush looking for signs. It didn't take much for him to pick up the tracks and lead us straight to them. 
  
"So, plan of attack?" He whispered. I kept my voice as low as I could, though whispering was difficult for my kind. It was a shame I hadn't inherited more of my mother's side. 
  
"I'll take the largest as usual. You should focus on that squirlley-looking guy. I think he's the moneybags of the group." 
  
Tiron frowned, shooting me a look. I shrugged, muscles rippling under my skin. 
  
"Hey, if we're going to do this, we might as well make some money off of it." I said, and he chuckled as he melted into the darkness. The barebones plan was in place and we were off to the races, as it were. I stood up and strode into the thieve's camp.
  
The chaos was instant. People dashed for their weapons, milled about — one particularly damp thief just hightailed it out of there. He didn't make it far before my sensitive ears picked up the sound of his throat being slit. I grinned, snatching at the bear of a man in front of me. He dodged, moving like quicksilver. Huh. A thief with training. Different tactics then... I switched to defence, monitoring the man and the action around me. No one had decided to interfere with us, probably afraid of getting inadvertently hurt. 
  
The man swung his own fist toward me, and I skipped lightly back. My father's blood may have given me size, but my mother had given me the fleetness of her kind. I had the man pegged now; knew what fighting style he preferred. It was a shame. If we'd met in other circumstances I might have liked to get to know him, maybe shared a pint. Ah well. 
  
I leaned forward, ducking under the left hook I knew was coming. He smiled as he came round with his right. 
  
"You fool! I was trained with the best of the Carens, you cannot hope to defeat me!" He roared, as I slid away from his right-handed blow. Laughing, I cast a quick glance at the other thieves. A good half of them were on the ground, clutching their throats as they bled out. Good. Tiron was having fun. I turned back to the man in front of me, stepping inside his swing fists and lifting him off the ground by his shirt lapels. 
  
"You underestimate how little I give a shit about your training. Tiron!" I shouted the last, throwing the man into the air like a clay pigeon. At the height of his arc, a dagger hit him in the eye. Tiron had been practicing. I took a second to breathe.
  
Around me, the area was littered with corpses, but the squirrelly moneybags was nowhere to be seen. Neither was Tiron. Sniffing, I followed the scent of blood and excitement to the nearby river. There, to my surprise, Tiron was on the ground, with moneybags standing over him, jeering about the fact he'd bested an elf. I saw red.
  
In an instant, I had my hand wrapped around the man's neck encircling it completely. He choked in the middle of a word. I brought him close to my face as I squeezed. 
  
"Don't. Ever. Mess. With. My. BROTHER!" I shouted as the life left the squirrely man's body. Tiron was on his feet in an instant, rifling through the man's pockets. He may have been knocked down, but he didn't seem any worse for the experience. Soon, we were walking back to our camp, our own pockets significantly heavier. 
  
"You know, you weren't exactly right when you yelled at the man. You're actually my *half-brother*." Tiron said, sounding tired. I forgave him his pedantry, I knew it was an aftereffect of the fight.
  
"Yes, but you all didn't like my father, so I try not to bring it up," I said. Tiron shook his head, sighing, as we drew up to the fire. 
  
"I don't know, I think it would have been cool to have a giant for a step-father. Sometimes I think the elves are too snooty." 
  
I settled myself on the ground, rummaging around in my haversack. To my delight, something round met my fingers. Pulling it out and showing it to Tiron, I smiled. 
  
"Well, at least you ain't one of the snooty ones. So, you want an apple, Half-Brother?" I asked. He laughed, a laugh both of relief and absolute joy. 
  
"Oh, I definitely want an apple. Halvesies?" 
  
I nodded at him. 
  
"Always halvesies."
