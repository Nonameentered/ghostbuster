The last syllable scraped my throat as I finished the spell. No one alive knew what happened next. The ninth circle spell was considered too dangerous, too powerful. No one wanted to find out what would happen with that much power. Except me. Everyone else had too much to lose. 
  
My vision darkened, before flashing bright white. As I blinked away the spots, a room came into view. It was all stone, almost clinical in precision. It didn't seem natural, as if someone had created the perfect image of a room, but not the real thing. I stood in the exact middle, my feet locked against a cut circle of stone. In front of me, rose a lectern, and behind that a person.
  
They were young, perhaps only my age, and yet I couldn't determine much more than that. Not their gender, nor whether they were a powerful mage, nothing. It was as if they weren't quite there in the same way that the room wasn't quite real. But their question was tangible enough, the word reverberating in the unnatural quiet of the room. 
  
"Why?"
  
Only that word. It was a challenge coming from them, a demand for an explanation. I flinched, trying not to show my discomfort. It wasn't the question I'd expected; not one I wished to answer. The circle of stone beneath my feet shifted, spinning me to the left. There, where before had been only empty space, stood another lectern, and another person.
  
Their face was wrinkled, the weight of years bending them until they barely showed behind the lectern. But again, I could make out no more than their age. Nothing else seemed to be important here, or perhaps able to be shown. They too opened their mouth and asked a question.
  
"Why?"
  
Not a challenge from them, but a question of infinite sadness. As if the whole world would cry if this person repeated themselves. I hoped that they wouldn't, that I wouldn't be forced to answer. The circle shifted, this time to my right, spinning past the original lectern. Again, where there had been nothing, a lectern and a person appeared.
  
A child, too short to be able to see over the lectern peeked around the side. Their eyes sparkled, as if with some secret they wanted to share. And they too asked the question. The only question that seemed to matter in this place. 
  
"Why?"
  
Sheer unbounded curiosity and joy rang through the air. The smile that formed on my cheeks wasn't of my own making, but of the delight that voice evinced. But even that emotion couldn't destroy the fear I had of that question. That dreaded query. Why did I cast the spell?
  
The echoes of the three voices bounced off the walls, ringing in my ears, pressing in on me like a physical force. My knees bent until I knelt, my back crumpled until I lay in a heap on the floor. Finally, I could bear it no longer. 
  
"Because!" I meant to say more, but the one word stopped the torturous echoes. With wild hope, I raised myself to my knees. Perhaps that would be all they needed. Three faces stared back at me expectantly, the podiums having moved until I could see them all as a unit. And with a sinking in my stomach, I knew they wanted more.
  
"Because I needed to. Because the knowledge was burning me up inside. Because it was my last hope." Their faces looked down impassively. I swallowed hard. "Because... I was lonely." 
  
The words dropped from my lips like the stones that created the room. It was the reason I had barely admitted to myself, the one thing I'd kept locked away in my mind. My eyes had dropped to the floor, and I witnessed as well as felt the stone circle spin again. Two feet appeared at the edge, and knowing already what I would see, I looked up. 
  
"Because, I missed you."
  
The woman at the edge of my circle smiled down at me. She was a familiar figure, though there were signs here and there of the changes this place must wreak. A sense of otherness, of something not quite real. Even her smile was different. 
  
"That is not a good—" The first voice, the person my own age started to say, but my love held up her hand, cutting them off. At the same time, she held out her other towards me. Before I could take it, she spoke, her voice soft.
  
"You need to make a decision. Do you stay here, among the spirits, amidst the others who cast this spell, for eternity, never resting, never moving on from our work? Or do you go back to your home, back to the world below?" 
  
I stared up at the face I knew so well, knew like my own. 
  
"What decision did you make?" Her eyes hardened at my question, then softened. 
  
"You know what I decided. I decided to stay. Life back there..." She trailed off, raising her eyes as if looking back in time. "You were the only good thing in it." 
  
"You said I had to choose between here, and home." I rose under my own power and slid my hand into hers. "There is no difference between the two. Wherever you are, beloved, is my home." 
  
Her smile would have been reward enough, but it was echoed by three other voices.
  
"Welcome!"  With whatever I'd said, or perhaps because of her interference, I had passed the test.
  
And with a gentle tug, she pulled me off the spinning platform, out of the strange stone room, and into my new life as one of the Ascended.
