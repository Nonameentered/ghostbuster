"Name, age, race and creed if appropriate." The words rolled off my tongue as the quill hovered over the paper. I'd lost count of how many times I'd said them in my time here. 
  
"Um, Caiel, 31, half-elven, and I don't have a creed." As was usual, the half-elven voice tingled with magic. Illegal magic. I spared a brief glance up at the new prisoner, not seeing anything I hadn't before. Tall, lithe and unfortunately pretty. It was surprising, actually that he hadn't been caught prior to this. Most half-elves had difficulty hiding. 
  
"Hand. Left or right, your choice." I couldn't help the boredom that leaked into my voice, and as the half-elf hesitated, I rolled my eyes at the other guard. He quickly suppressed a smile and gave the prisoner a shove on the shoulder. 
  
"She's not going to cut it off, stupid. Just hold out your hand." 
  
The half-elf hurriedly complied, and I slid a small metal loop onto his wrist. It tightened until you couldn't fit even a piece of paper between it and the skin. The man in front of me fell to the floor, writhing a little. I sighed, nodding to the guard. Bending, the guard picked up the now unconscious half-elf and carried him through the far door and out of sight. I turned to a new page in the book and scratched the date at the top. It was always a shock to the half-elves—really to any creature that had magic woven into them— to have it suppressed by the bracelet. He would recover soon enough. Raising my voice, I shouted. 
  
"Next!"

I walked through the prison, hearing the usual cries. The sobs of pain, the sadness, the despair. Those weren't the worst ones though. No, the worst were the ones that stared at you through their cell bars. They didn't look angry, sad, or hopeful. There was nothing left in their eyes, nothing but an empty shell. 
  
I tried not to look. 
  
I'm not heartless. But I have a job to do. The powers that be had decided magic was illegal. So, I processed the prisoners. I put their bracelets on. And I programmed the bracelets.
  
Returning to my little office, I sighed, checking the timer I kept in my drawer. Still a bit of time left. I leaned back, staring up at the ceiling, knowing that far above me, the government, the lawmakers; everyone in charge would be gathering to think of new laws to oppress the people. New laws to suck the magic out of the world. They'd wanted to keep the prisoners under their feet, to make sure everyone was trapped, to keep a personal eye on things.
  
Myself, I think it's a bit of a stupid idea. But I'm just a drudge.

"You see gentlemen, with our superior technology, the magic users are rendered helpless." The Prime Speaker stared at those gathered around him. It was Presentation day, a day to show the shareholders that the government was doing its job. Everyone had to be present. I was lurking in the background, checking my timer. I'd shifted it to my pocket, though it made a ridiculous bulge in the front of my skirts. 
  
The timing had to be perfect. 
  
Massed in a huddle in the center of the giant meeting room, the prisoners curled in on themselves, as if trying to hide from the light. I'd chosen these ones specifically, though if you asked the bailiff, he'd picked them himself. They were doing an excellent job of acting afraid. 
  
Almost compulsively, I checked my timer again. The display read 0000:001. As the Prime Speaker opened his mouth to say something, I raised my own voice, shouldering through the crowd. 
  
"But there's a flaw in the technology. There's a really, really obvious problem." I said. Murmurs ran through the room, a quiet susurration of sound. The Prime Speaker drew himself up, but I wasn't about to let him steal this moment. 
  
"You see, the flaw is this. They can be programmed." I continued. A shout rose from a shareholder. 
  
"Programmed to do what?" 
  
Reaching the huddled mass of prisoners, I tapped one of their shoulders and then turned to the Prime Speaker with a grin. 
  
"Release."
  
As I spoke the word, my timer clicked down, a small beeping noise emanating from my skirt. And the bracelet on every prisoner fell to the ground. Gasps rose from the crowd, but the Prime Speaker raised his hands in a calming motion. He sneered at me, motioning to the guards that flanked the room. 
  
"You forget that all of these people were caught once. They were imprisoned for years. What gave you the idea that this little stunt of yours was ever going to work?"
  
I smiled at him, a vicious snarl of an expression, and reaching deep inside, I summoned my own magic. The magic I kept buried and hidden until the perfect moment. 
  
"They have me." And I pushed my power out, sending it through the room,  and down through the floor, reaching for the prison beneath us. 
  
I did say the bracelet on *every* prisoner released.
  
The floor creaked as the ground shook, and a fireball flashed out of the half-elf nearest me, incinerating one of the fast-approaching guards. He frowned at me, confused. 
  
"All I wanted to summon was a spark. What—" His eyes went wide as he came to a quick realization. I smiled. 
  
"Give 'em hell Caiel." I said, and I moved swiftly away from the magic users. They would be rusty and I didn't want to get hit by friendly fire, as it were. 
  
The Bailiff grabbed me by the shoulder, screaming into my ear. 
  
"What did you do? That half-elf is a Level 1 threat usually. He can't light more than a candle."
  
"I amplified his power. That's what I do. That's all I do. But I can do it extremely well." I said, with considerable satisfaction. The bailiff's face went white, as all the blood drained out of it. 
  
"So..." He whispered. 
  
"So, any Level 1's are now at least a Level 3. And it grows exponentially with power. So a Level 6 threat usually, is..." I trailed off letting him do the math. 
  
"Oh." It seemed to small a word for the enormity of the situation. A ray of ice shot past us splattering into three government officials. I smiled at the Bailiff. 
  
" So, basically. Run."

Chaos reigned in the building and the prison. Safley outside of it, on a nearby hill, with Caiel as my self-proclaimed bodyguard, I couldn't help the laughter that ran through me. It had taken years, hundreds of them. But finally, finally, we were free. Caiel laid a hand on my shoulder, checking to see if I was okay. 
  
"We're free Caiel. We're free." He nodded at my words, but his face clouded. 
  
"Why did you wait so long?" 
  
"I had to make sure there were enough prisoners." I shook my head, sighing. "I didn't like doing it. I didn't like seeing their spirits break. But if the attack was to be successful, we needed the numbers." 
  
A loud crack cut off anything he would have said in response. In front of us, the building was imploding, drawing in on itself. Anyone who'd dodged the original onslaught wouldn't escape that. As it seemed to wink out of existence, there was a huge gust of wind, that nearly made me lose my footing. If Caiel's hand hadn't remained on my shoulder, I would have fallen.
  
I did always think putting a prison beneath a government building was a stupid idea. 
  
Thank goodness for stupidity.
