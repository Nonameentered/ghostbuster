It had been a long week. I was tired, just going through the motions of living. Work had gotten to me, my girlfriend had left me, and my life was starting to resemble an old country song. And now I had a two-hour flight booked at the last minute, because across the country one of my good friends was having emergency surgery. They needed someone with them and I was the first person they thought of. It wasn't their fault, and I was happy to help, but it was another thing on an already overloaded plate. 
  
All of this was weighing on my mind so much, that I nearly didn't register what the flight attendant said. I was already seated, the only consolation to my horrible life; that my friend had comped me for first class. He really was a good guy, I would have to thank him somehow. 
  
"You're going to be the only person on this flight." She repeated herself, looking slightly aggravated. I took another moment to process. 
  
"Empty plane? Or a booking error?" I asked, trying to act like this happened to me all the time. She shook her head. 
  
"No, I said you'd be the only *person* on this flight." Before I could ask for clarification, we began moving, and she rushed out of first class. Well, thank goodness for cryptic flight attendants. Now I had a mystery to keep me away from much-needed sleep. 
  
As we rose into the air, and I frantically chewed my gum to try and get my ears to pop—plane travel was my least favourite, as it often led to ear pain from the pressure—I resisted the urge to ignore the seatbelt light and wander out of first class. Whoever, or whatever was on this plane wasn't in this section. But they also weren't going anywhere, so I had time. Finally, the light turned off and I was up in an instant. Now I'd find an answer.
  
But it was not to be. A different flight attendant came in, asking if I needed anything, if there was anything he could do, etcetera. Then, he sprayed me in the face with some kind of aerosol device and everything went black. 
  
When I woke up, I was back in my seat. There were low, growly voices all around me, so I kept my eyes shut. Until I knew more about the situation, I didn't want them aware I was awake.
  
"What should we do, boss?" 
  
"Well, obviously we have a problem here."
  
"No one was supposed to be on this flight, why is there a person on this flight?" 
  
"Hey, we're people too."
  
"You know what I mean... A *human*." I bit my tongue at that last one, trying to keep my eyes from fluttering. They weren't human, whatever they were. And all the context clues I had, were the growly voices and an odd smell. I couldn't quite place it, but I knew I'd smelt it before. 
  
My face must have changed, scrunched, or moved in some way. There were a few yelps of alarm, and the boss voice had to calm everyone down. When they'd regained order, the voice addressed me.
  
"We know you're awake. When you open your eyes, I want you to remain calm. We mean you no harm, as long as you mean us no harm. You are not restrained, but I suggest you do not become violent."
  
I took a deep breath and opened my eyes. At first, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. After all, it was impossible. Completely, utterly, impossible. But I *could* finally place what I was smelling.
  
The plane was full of dogs.
  
Dogs of all shapes and sizes, from the equivalent of a chihuahua to a great dane. I say equivalent, because as I looked longer and harder, there were differences. The faces were odd, tending towards larger eyes, and taller foreheads. There was an obvious intelligence in all of them, a higher intelligence than most dogs. I could only think of one explanation. 
  
"Werewolves?" My voice squeaked. From the seat across from me, a bulldog chuckled. 
  
"No." It said. The boss voice seemed appropriate coming from it. "No, definitely not. Perhaps the best way we can describe it to a human, is aliens. Though that is not quite accurate either." The bulldog shook his head, spittle flying everywhere. It was comforting to know that these dogs still drooled. 
  
"You only know our lesser cousins. What you call dogs. We are... different." As he said the word, another part of the previous conversation rose in my head.
  
"What are you going to do to me?" I asked. The bulldog cocked his head to the side, another familiar motion. He was confused. 
  
"Do to you?"
  
"The situation," I prompted. "I'm a human on this flight, and I'm not supposed to be here?" I could see the headlines now. 'Man mauled by hundreds of dogs that say it was his own fault.' Or something like that. Laughter echoed around the plane.  I've got to say, it was disconcerting being laughed at by dogs. The boss bulldog quieted them down with a few sharp barks, that sounded a little like the words 'shut up.' But why wouldn't he just say—
  
"You being here isn't the situation. Or isn't all of it. Fred gets worried easily." He motioned with his head to a mournful-looking basset hound. "No, it's more than you being here. The situation is stress. Yours in particular. You, in point of fact, reek of stress. It's a very offputting smell." I stared at the dog, trying to figure out if I should be insulted. Then something heavy landed on my lap.
  
I looked down, into a pair of deep brown eyes. It was a Newfoundland, or at least its equivalent in whatever species this was. The bulldog chuckled, shaking its head again, and spreading more drool. 
  
"As usual, though she is a woman of few words, Lenore is right. You understand your own concept of service dogs? Well, for the next," He paused, seeming to calculate in his head. "Hour and a half, we are all, at your service. Prepare to be de-stressed." I looked back at Lenore, raising a hand to pet her, before stopping just above her head. 
  
"Are you sure, I should—" She stopped me by lifting her head just slightly and butting it into my hand. As I stroked her, I couldn't resist a smile. 
  
This was turning out to be a first-class flight after all.

(Epilogue)
  
When we landed, I thanked the dogs and walked off the plane a changed man. The stress was still there, it wasn't a miracle cure, but I felt better, more relaxed. And more able to help my friend recover from surgery. I smiled at the flight attendant, both of us party to a secret that we knew wouldn't be believed by anyone. 
  
"Have a nice flight sir?" She asked. I nodded, brushing at pants that were covered in dog hair.
  
"I had the best flight, thank you." 
  
I floated on the feeling of that flight all the way to my friend's hospital room. He was surprised but listened to the entire story. Though he said he believed me, he *was* high on pain medicine and the aftereffects of the anesthesia. It didn't matter. I knew that as soon as I could, I was going to go down to a local shelter.
  
After what those dogs did for me, it seems only fitting I should adopt one of their cousins, and give it a good home.
