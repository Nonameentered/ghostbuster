The activation of the curse always felt a bit like a pinch. I opened eyes that hadn't seen daylight in thousands of years... and sneezed. It was dusty, though there was nothing in my pocket dimension to create dust. This form certainly didn't make dust like my human form used to. I twitched uncomfortably, feeling the dimension shift and transport towards whoever had rebuilt the temple. When I'd first been imprisoned here, I had been significantly smaller. Now, my appendages scraped against the borders, my back pushed at the top. But I would soon be free, free to wreak torment on the fool who'd rebuilt the temple of Ka'ah.

My dimension jerked, stopping in place. Huh, that was odd... It turned in place, as if it had lost a scent. Then instantly it started off again, though in the exact opposite direction as before. I settled, nodding to myself. This had happened once or twice before, when the curse decided someone wasn't directly responsible, or that someone else needed to be punished first. It normally didn't happen so quickly— Another jerky stop, another spin as if to pick up the scent. Then another move in a different direction.

Okay, still nothing to be too concerned about, but if it happened again— I slumped against the sides of the dimension as it stopped, spinning more violently. What was going on? Again we set off, but in the next second the process repeated. I fought to keep my bowels placated, one didn't want to vomit in a pocket dimension that you practically filled. There wasn't a lot of room for cleanup.

It happened again, and again. I stopped trying to rationalize it, stopped trying to think. All my faculties were busy with survival. Time seemed to vanish, the world seemed to shrink even more. It was a relief when I was finally spat out into a small human house.

After I finished vomiting, and the human had finished screaming in terror at my horrendous form, I looked down at the table. There in front of me, cut into tiny pieces that had been cunningly fit together lay the temple. The two-dimensional image of the temple. I spun towards the cowering human.

"What is this... monstrosity?" When his ears stopped bleeding from my voice, he drew himself up from a crouch to a half-bend.

"It's a puzzle. You haven't seen— " He stopped, re-evaluated his question, and kept going. "An image is printed on wood or cardboard and cut into pieces which you then put together."  I stared at him, an inkling of what was happening percolating in my mind.

"And then what?" I tried to quiet my voice, and his ears only mildly bled this time.

"Well, mostly you end up putting it back into the box, most people don't have the room or desire to keep it assembled all the time. I was just about to do that when you appeared..." He stretched out a hand towards the puzzle.

"NO!" My shout threw him back against the wall. "Don't touch it!"

I was finally getting my equilibrium back, the world had stopped spinning around me, and he was about to consign me to return to the pocket dimension. I knew now why the curse had been so confused. People had been rebuilding the temple, and then completely destroying it, over and over again. This puzzle was more twisted than the original curse.

"How many *puzzles* are out in the world right now? With the temple on it?" I asked, dreading the answer. The man stared at me, his eyes wide.

"I don't know, but probably a lot. Toys "R" Us released it just a few days ago, and I'm sure they produced hundreds if not thousands."

My lower appendages buckled. *Thousands*? I would never be free to torment anyone, I'd be locked in an eternal spinning dimension, as the curse tried to decide where to spit me out. I was doomed... unless.

I squinted at the human in front of me. He trembled.

"I need something from you human. Don't ever break that puzzle. In return... I won't torment you too badly." The human frowned, staring up at me.

"But if I break it, you'll go away and not torment me at all. Right, because whatever brought you here has to do with the puzzle. So..." Again he reached for the puzzle. My mind scrambled, as I tried to think of a rebuttal.

"But... I'll owe you a favour. You'll have an eldritch curse abomination at your beck and call. And the torment..." I paused racking my brain, as once again I fought the urge to sneeze. "I'll... I'll... only curse you to sneeze once a day! That's it, that's all the torment." The human paused and I bit back a sigh of relief. He put his head to one side and scratched behind his ear.

"Hmmm. It might be useful, if you could moderate your form a bit— " I instantly shrank to about the size of a housecat, with the same general shape. "Huh. Well, you know, I could use a powerful entity in my corner. And if the torment is only a sneeze a day... All right."

I nearly expanded again with absolute delight. I wouldn't be relegated to spinny hell. He grinned, looking down at me.

"The first thing we're going to need is some kind of glue to hold the puzzle together, and do you think you could do something about those tentacles?" I peered over my shoulder at the mess of tentacles emerging from my furred back. At this point, I would have agreed to anything the man asked.

"I'll work on it. What is 'glue'?"

He chuckled, patting me on the head as I suffered the indignity.

"Oh, we're going to have a grand time together. Come on. As we go to the store, I'll explain."
