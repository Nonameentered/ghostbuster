It was one of the deaths I dreaded. The person was small, not much bigger than—no. I'd promised myself I wouldn't think about that. But deaths like this always brought it to the forefront of my mind. 
  
I waited patiently, the silent, invisible third party in the tiny hut. Before me, a woman bent with age and the burdens of life sat curled over the bed where her daughter lay. I didn't want to watch, didn't really want to be here. The life of a grim reaper wasn't easy. We saw the grief, the pain;  the loss, every day. And yet, a voice whispered in my mind. Would you prefer if no one mourned for the child? Just like your— No! 
  
I nearly shouted the word out loud, and though I managed to compress my lips, some sound leaked out. The girl on the bed turned to look at me, and rose, leaving her body behind. As her mother began to wail, the little girl walked to me, unafraid. 
  
"Are you here to take me away?" She asked. I bent, holding out a hand, softening a face I knew must be all hard angles at the moment. 
  
"Yes. It is time to go. I am to be your guide to the world beyond." As she put her hand in mind, the hut dissolved, a seemingly endless field of grain taking its place. 
  
The child gasped in wonder, stumbling a little as I began to walk. 
  
"Is this it? Is this the afterlife?" Her voice piped high and thin in the clear air. I couldn't resist a small smile. 
  
"No, child. This is simply an in-between place. A place of growth and harvest. Someday, the grain will be harvested, and on that day, the world will end. But it is not ripe enough yet." I said, guiding her through the knee-high stalks. The girl made a small sound of agreement.
  
"So what's the afterlife like?" She asked. My other hand tightened around my scythe, but I managed to keep the emotion out of my voice. 
  
"I don't truly know. I've never been there, but I've heard that is wonderful, a place of contentment and joy." 
  
A silence fell, and we walked for a few minutes more through the grain. She began to hum under her breath, an old song, one I had once known well, one I had once— I shied away from the thought trying to focus on anything else. The humming stopped, and I nearly sighed in relief. 
  
"What happens after you guide me to the afterlife, mister?" I looked down at her, small face turned up to mine in a simple innocence. 
  
"That is when I say goodbye, little one." Her hand in mine tightened, squeezing with all her tiny strength. 
  
"I'm gonna miss you." 
  
I stopped moving.
  
As I stared down into her face, memories that I had fought so hard to ignore, to push down, raced through my mind. A little girl laughed as she ran around the house, as I tried to get her to go to bed. Holding her in my lap, telling story after story as thunder crashed around our house and she clutched tight to me. The letter in the mail calling me away, calling me to war. Tears streaming down my little girl's face as I gave her to the neighbour to care for, the words, the second last words she'd ever said. 
  
"I'm gonna miss you." And then as I'd turned away, unable to say the words in my own heart, the tiniest sound, my daughter's last words. "I love you."
  
A small hand reached up, bringing me back to the field of grain. I was on my knees, and the child in front of me wiped a hand across my face.
  
"Mister, you're crying. What's wrong." I resisted the urge to hug the girl, so like my own. 
  
"Long ago—" My voice cracked. "Long ago, I lost someone. I lost my little girl. I had to go away, go fight in a war, and when I returned, my daughter, my darling, she'd gotten sick. She'd died. And—" I stopped, unable to say it, unable to speak the ugly thoughts that had tormented me for so long. The girl laid a hand on my cheek.
  
"And?" I stared into her eyes, and something broke inside me. 
  
"And, I never said 'I love you.' I never told her that I loved her. I wanted to, I knew I should, but it wasn't something I could ever seem to say. It wasn't— I couldn't—I..." My words turned into sobs, the emotion I could no longer repress flooding out. Small arms wrapped around me, pulling me into a hug. And there, in that place, in the world between the worlds, I finally cried. 
  
When the tears stopped, I pulled away from the child, feeling slightly embarrassed. She stared at me, her own face wet. 
  
"My mother didn't often say I love you." She said. "But I knew. She took care of me, she held me when I was scared, she cried when I cried, she laughed when I laughed. She told me, every day by her actions that she loved me." The little girl reached out, seeming somehow older than me at this moment, wise beyond her years. 
  
"And I think your little girl knew. I think she knew how much you loved her. She knew." 
  
I took a shuddering breath, as the words sank into my soul, soothing against the sharp firey pain. Reaching out, I took the little girl's hand, rising from my knees, once again turning to walk through the grain. I couldn't find any words before we reached the sudden end of the field, where a dirt road created a boundary. It was never in the same place twice and I hadn't expected it so soon. Looking down at the child once again, I tried to smile. 
  
"Here is where I leave you, little one. You may leave the field. I cannot. You only have to cross that road, and your afterlife will greet you." She nodded solemnly and walked out onto the dirt. When she was halfway across, she turned and waved. I waved back, finding the words I needed before. 
  
"Thank you."
