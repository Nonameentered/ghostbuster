The trees pressed in around me as I moved towards the lake. It was dark, and I didn't dare use any light. The lake was forbidden to our entire village at night, and the Elders had guards to enforce those rules. But I knew this forest like I knew my sister's face, so I was fairly confident that I wouldn't get lost. No, the bigger worry was that I would inadvertently make some noise and alert the guards to my presence.

I drew closer, my steps slowing, as I caught glimpses of the water through the tree trunks. It was time to find a vantage point. Tonight I didn't want to get too close to the lake. If there was danger, I would observe it safely from the cover of the forest. Quietly circling just inside the perimeter trees, I settled on a space in between two large ones with plenty of small brush to hide my form. Just in time.

The moon slid out from behind the clouds, its silvery light dancing across the surface of the lake. Around the edges, small mushrooms raised their heads, seeming to glow with an answering light. Where the tree branches overhung the lake, trailing flowers curled down their vines, opening their petals towards the moon, bright white against the dark limbs. Small insects shining with their own silver light darted from flower to flower. And laced through it all was the palpable tingle of magic.

I sucked in a breath.

All this was amazing, but it was just the preamble. The floor show if you will. Floating through the night sky, as quietly as thistledown were dragons. Dragons!

I nearly turned and ran. Everyone knew a dragon would eat you without a second thought. But something held my feet in place. Turning in slow circles above the surface of the lake, the dragons, silver-blue in the moonlight, started to dance. There were at least three to start, and soon the numbers grew until six spun in the ethereal gambol.

I forgot to breathe. Forgot that it was dangerous, forgot that I wasn't supposed to be here. The dragons dipped and swayed, throwing up spray from the lake, then flying through the drops. Everything was quiet, even the water falling back down didn't make any noise. Something about this place made noise seem sacrilegious.

Time escaped me as I watched. But eventually, the moon went back behind the clouds. The mushrooms wilted, the flowers closing and fading back into the darkness. Bright insects winked away into the depths of the forest, as the lake water lost its silvery tinge. And the dragons...

The dragons, one by one, left their dance, rising away from the lake, their bodies glowing faintly as if bursting with absorbed moonlight. As the last one disappeared from my vision, the night sounds of the forest came pouring back.

Massaging cramped legs, I uncurled from my seat, leaning against one of the trees. I understood now, why the elders forbade us from coming. Dragons were dangerous, feared, creatures. But to see them like that, dancing, creatures of pure light and joy... You didn't want to believe that they'd hurt you. Worse, you wanted to join them. Yes, I understood why it was forbidden.

But that wasn't going to stop me from coming back tomorrow.
