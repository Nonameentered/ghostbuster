"I summon thee!" I finished the incantation, rubbing my hands together in glee. According to the illustration, it would be gigantic, monstrous, everything I ever wanted. I'd even moved the summoning circle to the barn, to accommodate the large being.

A plume of smoke rose from the center of the circle, and the candles began to burn with a black flame. It was happening... I leaned forward, making sure not to leave my own protective pentagram. Even holding my breath, the smell of sulphur was enough to make me gag. The smoke grew thicker and thicker, until it formed a column bounded by the edges of the circle. With this much, it had to be a large demon.

With a small flash, the smoke cleared. As I rubbed my eyes to clear the sunspots, I heard a cough. The demon was coughing? That couldn't be right. My vision came back, and I frowned at the circle.

There was a small child standing in the center.

Taking a moment to collect myself, I glanced at the book again. There, in black and white, was the illustration. Giant, terrifying, larger than life. Definitely not a small— coughing on its own smoke— child.

"What the heck are you?" I asked, my ire rising. I'd worked hard for the power to do this, dedicated a good portion of my life, and this creature was all I got? This was unacceptable, and I would very happily raise hell —as it were— to fix the mistake.

"I'm your demon." The voice was oddly deep for a child, and it took a minute to link it with that young face.

"You're not what I summoned," I raised the book, jabbing at the illustration. "This is what I summoned."

"That's what I'm supposed to be," Their voice rose in a wail, tears starting to well in their eyes. "This is my first time, and I got it wrong?"

Shit. I'd made the demon cry. Sighing, I closed the book, making sure to mark my place.

"Look, if it's your first time, it's not that bad. I mean, at least you're in the right location." The demon kept crying, big heaving sobs. I clamped down on another sigh. I may be evil, but I'm not *mean*...

"Come on, it's not so horrible. I mean, now you're a lovely shade of red. And that's a little closer to a demon. And if you squint, your hair could look like horns." I glanced down and nodded. "Your feet are hooves, so there's that." The child gulped, breath a little ragged, but the tears slowed.

"You really mean it?" They asked in a tremulous voice. "Does that mean you won't send me back? If I fail on my first time... Well, they're not very nice down there."

I frowned, my contrary nature asserting itself.

"Not very nice? They're fricking demons, of course, they're not nice. You're not supposed to be *nice*!" My voice rose with each word. "You have to learn to stand up for yourself. When you go back down there, you better have a backbone! You tell them—" I stopped, realizing I was shouting, and the demon looked like it was going to start crying again.

Raising my hands, I muttered the binding words, watching them settle over the child like a golden cloud. Safe now to step out of my pentagram, I walked over, picking them up and setting them on my large desk.

"Look. You're a demon. That means you're mean and sadistic and you don't take any kind of bullying. All right? Not even from me." They stared at me, eyes wide. I shook my head, giving into my urge to pace.

"You don't get it, do you? You're just a kid." I stopped, now in the center of the summoning circle. Looking at the child, I released the sigh I'd bit back before. What was I supposed to do with them? I couldn't send them back in their current state. They'd be demon snack food.

"Fine, kid. Listen to me very carefully okay?  This is an order." They straightened, golden sparks snapping around them as the binding spell forced them to listen; to obey. "You're going to stay here until you learn how to be a demon properly. And then when you go back, you're going to raise some serious hell, you got that?" I held out my hand.

The demon child looked at me, eyes bloodshot from crying. Then they nodded, a tiny smile breaking across their face. Hopping down from the table, they reached out, putting their hand in mine.

"Got it."

We walked out of the barn hand in hand, me trying to figure out how the heck I was going to teach a demon how to demon properly. As we entered the house, a small deep voice broke into my thoughts.

"Um, Mister Sorceror?"

"Yes?"

"Thank you." Their eyes bored into mine, and I couldn't help my heart—which I'd thought long dead—stirring a little in my chest. I cleared my throat, turning away.

"First lesson. Demons don't say 'thank you.'"
