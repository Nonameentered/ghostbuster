I don't quite know what drove me to it. But one day, I woke up and started building. I'd always enjoyed the practical physical part of my job, and this was a challenge unlike any other. Soon, thoughts of it consumed my mind. When I woke up, I thought about the machine, when I had a spare moment during the day, I thought about the machine, when I lay awake at night, I thought about the machine. It was everything.
  
About two months in, I quit my regular job to allow myself more time to work on the project. It had fast outgrown my garage and was now a hulking house-sized lump in my backyard. I fed any letters I got from the HOA into its engine, giggling a little under my breath. They did not realize the genius in this project; they would try to stop *my* progress. I would deal with them soon.
  
After five months, the machine grew too large for my backyard. Ignoring the newspapers that piled up on my doorstep, headlines screaming about strange electrical problems that seemed to only target certain homes in my neighbourhood, I turned my thoughts to how to gain more space for my glorious project. There was an abandoned junkyard not far away, that I could perhaps purchase...
  
At six months, my friends started to come around, looking concerned. I laughed away their worries, explaining that I could stop whenever I wanted, I just didn't want to yet. One by one, their voices faded away until only one friend kept showing up. Eventually, though they were reluctant, I recruited them into helping with the project. 
  
Finally, when a year and four months had passed, we were ready. The machine was complete. I didn't sleep the night before we would pull the switch. Bright and early, I was at the junkyard, polishing the lever, waiting impatiently for my friend, my partner in this madness, to arrive. As soon as his foot hit the dirt, I pulled the lever. 
  
The machine sprang to life, parts whirling around each other, pulling incredible amounts of electricity from the power grid. The entire city went dark. I couldn't resist the cackle that rose in my throat, as I rubbed my hands together. 
  
Five minutes passed. Ten. Twenty. There was the sound of sirens coming closer and closer to the junkyard. My friend looked at me. 
  
"So, I know I never asked this before, but what *exactly* does this machine do?" His question was like an ice bath shoved down my spine. I stared at him, in near-perfect shock. 
  
"I don't know."
  
"You what? You just spent a year of your life building something that you don't know what it does? Are you mad?"
  
"No! I just...haven't figured out what it does yet. It has to do something." I said. He looked towards the highway, where more and more blue and red lights were flashing. 
  
"Well, figure it out fast, or you won't be figuring anything but the number of bars in your cell." I ran around the machine until I spotted it. A tiny cubicle, only able to fit the two of us. 
  
"Get in!" I shouted, and without much hesitation, he jumped inside. 
  
The world shimmered, bent and warped around us. Then all the movement of the machine seemed to still, though I knew it was, that we were going faster than it somehow. And at that moment, I remembered what the machine did. A small ding came from the timer on the wall, and I pulled my friend out of the cubicle. Nothing seemed to have changed.
  
"If all that was just to get me in an enclosed space with you—" A loud cackle interrupted him. My loud cackle from about twenty minutes ago. I grabbed his arm, pulling him around to the back of the junkyard, away from the machine, away from our past selves, and towards my car. 
  
"It's a time machine, but it only works for short amounts," I shouted.
  
"Well, that's pretty useless!"
  
"Yes, but now we can escape, and build a new one that's better," I answered as I shoved him into the car. He looked at me, and I grinned. "Come on, it'll be fun!" 
  
As he looked from me to the machine, to the darkened city, an answering grin lit up his face, and I knew there were two of us now. Two absolutely mad engineers.
  
"All right Phineas. Let's go."

AN: I apologize to any actual engineers, as I have no engineering knowledge myself and this may be wildly off the mark.
