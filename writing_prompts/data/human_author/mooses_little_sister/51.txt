Hello Thank you for reading. I did realise that the vampire wouldn't be able to hear the engines, and as a few other commenters have said, I did address that, with the inner monologue of the vampire, as he wonders if he's going crazy.. 

\--"Hello! Can I come in? I'm very bored and hungry out here!" Huh, my voice actually made noise. But it shouldn't, and why can I hear their engines? We're in space. Am I breathing easier? Fresh air? Have I finally lost my mind?---

There's a bit of an atmosphere that The Neverland pushes out around itself once it gets close to anyone/any ship, so that piracy is made easier for the children. When this atmosphere is in place, there is breathable air, and sound can travel through that. 

Hope this helps you understand.
