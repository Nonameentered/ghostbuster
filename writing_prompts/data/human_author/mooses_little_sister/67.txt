When I died, I found myself on a staircase. Humming a well-known song about such a stairway, I began my ascent. Without any incident, I found myself at the pearl gates. But this was where things started to feel off. There was no one outside, guarding the entrance.

However, I didn't worry too much. We might have been misinformed about how this sort of thing worked. Maybe once you were on the stairs, you were accepted anyway, and there was no point in guarding a gate. It creaked as I went through, which perhaps should have been a warning.

Heaven was dark.

I don't mean the kind of dark you get at night. That at least has stars and the moon to provide illumination. No, this was the complete absence of light. I stepped back, feeling behind me for the gate. My fingers skated across the smoothness of the singular pearl and came away wet.

Raising them to my face, I sniffed, recognizing the coppery tang. Blood. Definitely blood. Trying not to panic, I shoved my hands into my pockets. I'd had a flashlight when I'd died, and I know they say you can't take it with you... but since everything else seemed wrong, maybe that rule had failed. Sure enough, my fingertips grazed cold metal and within seconds, I flicked the light on. And within seconds, I regretted it.

There, on the back of the pearl gate, hung an angel. It was in its most recognizable human form, but a blood eagle execution is disturbing no matter what form you were in. I swallowed, carefully wiping the remaining blood off my fingers. Turning, I directed the flashlight toward the center of the great city.

Quietly, trying to make no noise on the gold streets, I walked forward, resisting the urge to flee back down the staircase. I didn't know where it would lead if I went down. Maybe to Hell, and I figure even a dark Heaven is better than Hell, right? My small spot of light bounced slightly as I walked through the city.

At first, I kept it trained on the road. I didn't want to step on anything... nasty. And the play of light over pure gold was mesmerizing. When I raised the flashlight though, I wished I hadn't. From every building, from every high place, an angel hung.

They'd all been killed, some obviously tortured, others simply stabbed or sliced through the neck so deeply their heads were almost severed. I bit my tongue to stop the scream that tried to escape. What could have done this? And why didn't God stop it?

And where was God?

The terrible question made me stop, though I had no desire to stay any longer on that road of death. After all, the absence of God created this darkness, the light of their radiance no longer present. So where was God?

My breath starting to shorten, I resumed my journey through the empty city. I didn't have any real direction, I just had to keep moving. Slowly, I realized my feet were taking me on a specific route. I would turn in this direction and that as if I'd been here before. Yet I think I'd remember coming to Heaven. Eventually, I ended up in a large square, an obvious place for gathering.

A large throne rose in the center, though I don't think it was the throne described in the holy book. Around the throne, there were more bodies, more angels, slumped in a gross parody of worship. And on the seat itself...

A gargantuan figure sat, still upright, still staring out over the city. But there was no life in the eyes, no breath in the chest. I stood, at the edge of the square, and bowed my head.

I'd found God.

About to turn around, I took one last look at the giant corpse. And there, in the lap,  was a tiny glimmer of light. I scrambled towards it, forgetting that I walked over angel bodies to get there, forgetting that whatever had done this could still be here. Desperation for any other light than my own flooded through me. I reached the base of the throne and scaled one giant clawed leg.

Now level with the lap, I stared. Held there, curled in a gigantic hand was a tiny bead of pure light. I reached for it, almost in a trance. As my fingers brushed against it, images pounded through my mind.

Angels screaming as shadows flitted around them, killing relentlessly. Human souls—which I'd seen no evidence of in the city—running, but getting caught and clapped into chains. A ruthless battle between the figure on the throne and an equally large shadow monster. Wrapped in the memories, I screamed with the angels, I wept with the humans, I fought alongside God. Then, as the flood slowly abated, one final image shuddered across my vision.

The figure on the throne, sitting in the attitude I'd found them in. And standing in front of them, a man. He raised his hand in an ironic salute, then turned away, the shadows following him with their human slaves. Unable to rise, God poured the very last of their life force into the tiny spark of light in their hand. The very same spark I now touched.

Breaking the contact, I bent my head.

And wept.

I don't know how long I clung there, how long the tears fell into the giant lap. But when I raised my head, I had found a new resolve. Reaching out, I grabbed onto the small bead of light. It came easily to me, as if eager. Perhaps it knew what I wanted to do. Climbing down from the throne, I extricated myself from the pile of dead angels. Holding the spark of light in one hand, and the flashlight in the other, I walked in the direction the man with the shadows had taken.

I was going to find him. I had questions, I wanted answers, and he would give them to me whether he wanted to or not. I'd already faced the death of my God.

What more could anyone do to me?
