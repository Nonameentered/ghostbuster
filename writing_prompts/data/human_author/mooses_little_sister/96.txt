I panted, feet pounding the ground, hearing the hunters drawing closer. Ever since the Discovery life had changed for us. My thoughts shattered as a sharp crack echoed through the air. Instinctively I ducked, my foot catching on a lump in the ground. Stumbling I heard the whistle of a bullet fly over my head. Fortunately regaining my balance, I again dashed for the cover of the forest.

"Dang this one's fast. Cooter, circle around and see if you can cut it off."

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw movement to the right. Instantly I darted to the left, zigzagging across the remaining ground. My breath came in sobbing gasps but I dared not stop. The forest would provide safety, it had to be safer there. The thoughts spiralled in my head, urging me on, becoming the only things I could focus on. Get to the forest. The forest has to be safe.

Twigs snapped against my face, as I plunged into the bracken. From behind me, I could hear the hunters shouting at each other, but no clear words made it through. Still running, I didn't look back. That was the way they got you. You looked back, tripped and bumped your head.

But it turns out, I didn't need to look back to trip.

I tumbled, brambles tearing at my hands and face, the delicate bones in my left wing cracking with sharp bursts of pain. Thudding into the base of a large tree, I lay still for a second, trying to breathe. Dragging myself up, I limped further into the forest, no longer able to manage a run. But what I couldn't achieve with speed, maybe I could with stealth.

Carefully, I moved through the forest, quiet, making sure to leave no trail. The sun rose high in the sky, set in the west and still, I walked. My wing throbbed and still, I walked. The moon sailed through the sky and still, I walked. I couldn't stop. If I stopped, I'd have to think. And if I had to think... Finally, I fell to the ground, the muscles in my legs spent. Perhaps I would die here. Staring up at the dark leaves crisscrossing the starry sky, I sighed. At least it would be peaceful to die in this place. I closed my eyes and knew no more.

A wet cloth sponging my brow brought me awake. I shot upright, banging my head on the rafters. Cloth, rafters, the smell of fire. A house! Panic flashed through me and I jumped out of the bed, gaze darting around the room. The woman —holding a cloth, but now drenched in water that had sloshed out of the bowl she'd been carrying—smiled gently.

"Now, that is entirely too much exertion for someone in your condition. Please, at least sit down. You have quite a few scrapes and I'm trying to clean them." She gestured to the bed, and still wary, I perched on the edge. Tutting a little, she refilled the bowl from a barrel in the corner. As she wiped the cloth across my face, I looked a little closer at the room.

It wasn't properly a house, more of a small, one-room cottage. The bed I was on was shoved against one wall, which explained the rafters. She continued cleaning the scrapes and bandaging them. I nearly relaxed, it was nice to be taken care of. But then she touched my wing.

Leaping away from her, I whimpered slightly. The wing hurt terribly. Her eyes which had widened at my sudden movement softened as she nodded.

"I understand. You don't want me to touch that. Would it help if I said I didn't want to eat it?" I stared at her unbelieving. Everyone loved our wings. They'd fast become the most sought-after delicacy in the world.

"I see. You don't believe me, do you? Well, maybe I should tell you a story. It's about a little girl. She was about eight years old, and she fell over the edge of a cliff. But, you see, she didn't die. She fell, but she landed without a scratch. Because of one of your kind. Because of an angel."

"I'm not that kind of angel." My voice sounded hoarse and raspy with disuse. "I'm a messenger."

"So that means I should eat you?" She raised her eyebrows at me, a trace of humour entering her voice. "I have a debt. Life for a life. And besides. I think the trade in angel wings is barbaric. You are sentient beings, after all." Silence fell as I stared at her. Did I trust her words? Could I trust a human? After what they had done to our race, after what they had done to me—no, I couldn't think about that, even though I could never forget it. But did I trust this human?

The fight went out of me a little. I had trusted her before I'd even known it. She'd found me unconscious, she could have taken what she wanted then. Instead, she'd brought me home and helped. I swallowed, trying to make my voice less scratchy.

"You can touch it." The words still scraped over my throat. Nodding, she moved to my side, gently feeling for the bones in my wing. I couldn't help the small sounds of pain as she moved them back into place. By the time she finished, tears had gathered at the corners of my eyes.

There was a loaded silence as she moved back in front of me. Sadness etched new lines in an already weathered face as she looked into my eyes.

"I'm so sorry."

And with those three words, she broke every wall I'd built around my grief. The tears rolled down my cheeks soaking into the fresh bandages. I collapsed to the ground, pulled my knees to my chest and wailed. All the pain, all the sadness, everything I'd held inside. Gasping for air, I drowned in the sorrow.

Two arms wrapped carefully around my shoulders, pulling me out of the ocean; bringing me to shore. The woman held me like she'd hold a crying child, rocking back and forth on the floor.

"There, there. Shhh. Let it out. Let it out."

Eventually, I ran out of tears and I pulled free from the embrace, turning to look at my comforter. Her own face was wet. It was the first time I'd seen a human cry for an angel.

Reaching out, I pulled her back into a hug, though this one was shorter than the first.

"Thank you. Thank you for caring. Thank you—" My voice cracked, and I stopped. She rose, pulling me from the floor as well.

"I know a little of what it's like." She rolled up her pant leg, revealing an artificial limb. "I lost something too. Though it was not taken from me as cruelly as yours was from you." I shuddered, her words bringing back the feel of a knife slashing at my right wing, the feel of the weight falling away from me.

Letting her pant leg go, she dusted her hands off.

"Well, after a good cry, the best thing is to make some tea. Would you like some?"

Still not able to talk, I nodded, sitting at the rough-hewn wood table. As she bustled around the cottage, I sighed.

Perhaps I could rest here for a while.
