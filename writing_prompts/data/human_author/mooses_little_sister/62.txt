"Count the cost..."
  
Sand. All there was here, seemingly all there had been. My grip tightened on Alarik's hand. He squeezed back, trying to send some comfort my way. I appreciated the sentiment, but there was nothing particularly comforting about the place we found ourselves. Next to us, a lamppost curved, holding an orange lantern that cast a small circle of light. Looming just on the edge of that circle, there was a dead tree, branches black against a dark sky. On each of the lower limbs, practically motionless, completely silent, crows perched, eleven in all.
  
The wind was growing stronger by the minute, the sand bouncing up, before falling again to the ground. I huddled closer to Alarik. 
  
"Courage Lise. We've been through worse than this. Remember?" Leaning against him, I shook a little. The emptiness inside my head had never felt more horrible than at this moment. 
  
"No. I don't remember, I can't. There's nothing left since that last attack." Alarik turned us until his forehead leaned against mine, taking both my hands in his. 
  
"I'm sorry love. I forget sometimes how much your magic steals from you. But you got us out of that mess—"
  
"And into a worse one," I said, focusing on his boots, not able to summon the courage to look at his face. Raising his head away from mine, Alarik sighed. 
  
"Eleven crows. How does the old rhyme go?" He said. That I could remember, it was an old memory, one I'd learned at my grandmother's knee.
  
"One for sadness, two for mirth; Three for marriage, four for birth; Five for laughing, six for crying; Seven for sickness, eight for dying; Nine for silver, ten for gold," I took a breath. "And eleven a secret that will never be told." 
  
"Well then. It's a good thing there aren't eight. A secret isn't quite as bad as dying." He chuckled. I knew he was just trying to distract me, and I loved him even more for it. 
  
"But a secret can cause death." Distracting me had always been difficult. The sand was starting to rise higher now, a sandstorm imminent. Alarik drew me into his arms, and I sank against him, drawing in his familiar scent. 
  
"What secret could the crows hint at, I wonder? Have you been keeping something hidden?" There was a faint laugh in his voice, paired with absolute confidence about my answer. And yet... 
  
"There is something." My voice was small, swallowed by the swelling roar of the wind. But I felt Alarik stiffen, knew he'd heard me. 
  
"What is it, love? You know you can tell me anything." I could hear the affection in his voice, and something in me cracked. 
  
"I have enough magic left to get us out of here," I whispered. "But I don't want to. The cost..." I trailed off, and I hoped Alarik hadn't heard the last part. And wished that he had heard it, wished that he would tell me to stop. 
  
I looked up, staring into the eyes I knew so well. I couldn't let those eyes never see again. Couldn't let him die here in this wasteland.  Drawing on my magic, I could feel it starting to race through my mind, flooding my vision; turning the night to day. Wrapping my arms tighter around Alarik, I screamed as the sand, the tree, the lampost, the crows, everything faded away. 
  
Dry grass crunched under my body, an empty lakebed a stone's throw away. I rose, frowning up at the blue sky. How did I get here? 
  
"You used your magic again, love. That's how we're here." A man walked toward me, an imprint of his body pressed into the grass a few feet off. He held out a hand. 
  
I flinched.
  
"Who are you?" My voice sounded hoarse. Had I been screaming? The man's hand dropped, absolute devastation on his face. His eyes... Did I know those eyes?
  
"No, oh no, dearest. What have you done?" He sounded heartbroken. "It's me, Alarik." The way he said the name, it was like he expected me to know it. But I was pretty sure I'd never heard it before in my life. 
  
"Alarik? Do I know you? Do you know why we're both here?" I asked, watching him flinch at each word as if I was whipping him. 
  
"You used your magic. The cost is your memory loss. It may come back, but there are no guarantees. Normally, you trust me to tell you what's happened in the past. But now—" His voice cracked, as tears started to dampen his eyes. Those eyes... I knew them, didn't I? Something sparked in his face. 
  
"Lise. You're crying." 
  
I raised a hand, wiping it across my face. It came away wet. My feet moved without conscious thought, taking me closer to him, stopping inches away. I tilted my head back, staring up into those familiar eyes. Disjointed images flashed through my mind; a lampost, sand, orange light and a dead tree with eleven crows. 
  
And two people, standing hand in hand staring into the seemingly endless desert. 
  
I reached up, laying a hand against his cheek. At the touch, memories snapped back with a clarity that nearly left me gasping. 
  
"Alarik. My heart!" He pulled me into a hug, and I could feel him shaking. 
  
"Never, never do that again. Please. Please never do that. I'd rather die, Lise, than have you not know me. Than have you look at me like you did just then. The cost is too great." 
  
I nodded against his chest, unable to speak. We'd had a lucky escape, there had been no guarantees that my memory would come back. As we started around the edge of the dried lake, once again hand in hand, my thoughts returned to my childhood, to the rhyme I'd learned at my grandmother's knee. Her crackly voice echoed in my head. 
  
"...Eleven, a secret that will never be told. And remember, child. We have magic, and sometimes we will use it. But little one, always, *always*, count the cost."
