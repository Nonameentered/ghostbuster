The mausoleum rose around me, columns cold and menacing, seeming to shout that I didn't belong. I wasn't supposed to be here; wasn't wanted, hadn't been allowed at the funeral. Of course, no one knew that I would have come if I could. 
  
Keeping to the shadows like always, I stole closer and closer to the raised dais. I knew what I would find there, and my steps slowed as if I walked through deep mud. The moonlight fell through the skylights, passing through the glass-topped coffin, caressing the woman's face in a way I could never do again.
  
 I pressed my fingers to the glass, for once not caring if I left prints behind. She lay there, perfectly preserved, the enchantments making sure she never decomposed. It was only fitting for a lady of her rank. 
  
"I came as soon as I could." My voice sounded small in the great chamber, not loud enough to raise even a single echo. "I'm so sorry, my darling. That I couldn't be here, that I couldn't be at your side when—" I stopped, tears falling onto the glass, sliding down across her face as if she was crying with me. 
  
Unable to look any longer, I slumped beside the coffin, staring into the dark hollow of the mausoleum. It perfectly matched how I felt inside. Empty, and yet full of death. 
  
"It's not fair," I whispered, barely able to form the words. "I'm the thief. I'm the one who's supposed to steal, and yet, you're the one who took my heart from me. You became my world, and then you died. It's... not fair." 
  
Leaning my head back, I stared up at the sky,  the light of the stars so far away from me, here, in the dark. 
  
"How do you go on, when your world dies? How do you even start?" I swallowed, feeling the pain claw inside me like a physical creature. "I thought it would be better to see you like this. To really feel that you were dead, you know. To really start to believe it. But... It just hurts. There's no closure, there's nothing. Nothing left anymore."
  
A noise, the scrape of a footstep, nearly sent me springing away into the dark. Halfway through the motion, I settled back. Let them come, let them take me. It didn't matter anymore. Instead of the loud shout I expected, there was a soft sigh, as someone sat beside me. 
  
I turned to look, thinking it must be some guard who'd decided to give me a chance to run. Instead, I took in the aquiline nose, the sharp features, and the mouth that reminded me of the woman in the coffin. He stared into the dark, not even glancing at me. 
  
"You asked how you go on, when your world dies." The voice was even softer than mine. "My daughter asked that once. When she lost her mother. Oh, she didn't use those words, but she asked, all the same." His long fingers interlaced and he clenched them around his knees, as if he could hold himself together. 
  
"What did you tell her then?" I asked.
  
"I told her that it was hard. That for a long time, it would feel like there was nothing left. That you never really get over the loss of someone you love. It's the price we pay for loving someone. You give them the ability to hurt you. But eventually, that pain, it grows smaller. The beast that feels like it will tear you apart, its teeth grow dull. Oh, they still can give you a painful nip, but it does let go, instead of clinging like a bulldog."
  
He stopped, looking somehow thinner as if the speech had stolen his energy. I couldn't speak, my own grief swelling into my throat, stopping my vocal cords. What could I say? 
  
We stayed there as the moon shifted, and the mausoleum grew darker. Finally, I rose, laying a hand on the glass in a last goodbye. My companion rose with me, and I found my voice at last. 
  
"Why didn't you shout for the guards? I'm not supposed to be here." There was a thick silence, and I could imagine him staring at me. Or perhaps looking at the woman that— without the moonlight—we could no longer see. 
  
"She was my daughter. You were the person she loved. You were *her* world..." He paused, and thinking that was the end, I started to walk away. The last words I ever heard him say, followed me through the mausoleum columns. 
  
"And I loved her. So I give her world a chance to live. "
