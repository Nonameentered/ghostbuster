Thank you for reading! And for writing such a wonderful comment in reply!  You definitely picked up what I was putting down with the story.

 As for my main character, and for the others in the family, I always try to remember that I'm writing about people, people with their own flaws, with their own characteristics and with their own battles to fight, whether that be adventures, farming, or the realistic reasons why they had to retire from their adventuring life. (Which I'm glad that you liked!)
