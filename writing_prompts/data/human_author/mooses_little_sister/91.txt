Thank you for reading, and engaging with the story! As u/Aether_Breeze said, there was quite a bit of time that passed,  and unfortunately, the girls did get too old to go to that corner of hell when they died.  I should have perhaps made that a bit more clear in the writing, mentioned that many years had passed or something like that. I shall keep it in mind for the next time I have time jump in such a fashion.
