The ground shook, a great groaning sound of earth moving and pushing together. Mountains rumbled as if threatening to fall upon their faces. Great chasms opened; molten lifelines of the planet laid bare to the elements. Rivers overflowed their banks, hissing in great gouts of steam when they fell into the crevices.
  
The sky swirled, blue fast disappearing into the dark black of thunderheads. A whipping wind snatched at the sparse trees the earth had left standing, ripping them out of the ground, hurling them like a giant's spears. Thunder crashed and as if it tore open the clouds, fire fell in sheets igniting the ground. 
  
Amidst the tumult of earth and sky, another sound rose through the air. It was a roar that would have struck fear in the stoutest of hearts. A roar that spoke of death and destruction, of hopeless despair for anyone that heard it. Wings cracked in the air, rivalling the thunder of the clouds with their noise. Another roar of pure rage echoed through the sky, and the beast rose as if from the very depths of Tartarus itself.
  
It flew through the wind, fire, and steam, untouched. Indeed, it seemed to enjoy the destruction its rising had caused. With swift wingbeats it landed on a trembling mountain, roaring loud and triumphant. Then with a beady eye, it stared at the occupant of the mountain nearest itself.
  
"Hmmm. Good." As the man spoke, everything stopped and cleared. Clouds vanished, canyons snapped shut, the rivers ran back in their courses and the trees rooted themselves where they had fallen. "However, I think you need to try again. But this time with *feeling*!" 
  
He gestured dramatically at the beast. Who— seemingly all out of roars—  whimpered. The man shook his head.
  
"Yes, yes, I know you're tired. But if you want to come off as properly scary and menacing, you'll listen to me. We're going to do this as many times as it takes for you to get it right. You do want to get it *right* don't you?" The man's voice had an odd threat, and the beast flinched back. 
  
"Now. Let's start again from the top. And remember," The man started to shout as the beast flew away. "This time you really have to *mean it*!" 
  
He settled himself on his mountain shaking his head and muttering. 
  
"It's always the same. They think they want to be trained by the best, but do they really? No. They just want to half-ass things. Well, not on my watch— " He broke off, as the earth started to rumble. 
  
"Ah, well. Here we go again."
  
The ground shook, a great groaning sound of earth moving...
