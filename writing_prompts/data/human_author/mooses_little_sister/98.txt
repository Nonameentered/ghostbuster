General Alphosel's Daily Record.

Day 30

The campaign has stretched overlong. Our already limited rations of tea and coffee are running low. I have allowed only a few other soldiers to know of this fact. If word got out, it would spark a riot, or worse, the soldiers would leave. Search parties are scheduled to dispatch at mid-day. Hopefully, they find something in this strange place.

Day 32

The search parties have returned. Their results... are questionable. It seems coffee is out of the question entirely, though they have found some other nuts, fruits and seeds that may be satisfactory. At the least, they will help stretch the remaining rations further. I will instruct the cook to work some into the morning drinks at once. As for tea, it is easy enough to substitute herbal blends, but black tea will be more difficult. The search parties will have to keep looking.

Day 35.

Unfortunately, the substitutions had problematic effects. I have included an itemized list below.

\* The reddish nuts caused a number of hallucinations, chief of which centred around a large hairy monster. This resulted in absolute mayhem until the hallucinators could be rounded up.

\* The small purple berries have an unfortunate effect on a soldier's bowels, leaving him incapacitated for the day.

\* The grey seeds cause quite a pleasant numbness of the mind, allowing one to drift to sleep with ease. I will give these to the medical staff. They should make good use of them.

Alas, the hunt continues.

Day 39

The search parties are sent out again. And again they come back without a proper substitute. However, I will order the cook to try these nuts, seeds, and leaves in the tea this time. Perhaps the others combined with the coffee to produce such nasty results.

Day 40

There is a bee in my tent! I hate bees...assweioojffe sdldsflw'. Sorry, that didn't make any sense. Bees are scary. What is going on? The tent has lifted up into the air. Now we're on the sea, oh, make everything stop spinning...spinning...spinning. The bee has returned with an army of bees. Or are they hornets? Wasps? Sshhh they'll hear you. This quill is so loud on the paper. Would you like to know a secret? I don't really hate bees... Don'nt tell anyone! Or I'll have you court-martialed. Or whatever it is that I do to punish people. My head feels weird.

Day 41

The previous remarks were made under the influence of a rather nasty attempt at a substitute for tea. I strictly instructed the cook to make sure my tea was unaffected but it seems he got confused. He'd better have just been confused. Besides my regrettable incident, we have discovered a few other interesting combinations.

\* If you mix the grey seeds with a few serrated leaves, instead of sending you to sleep, the tea simply makes you feel more relaxed, without any horrible side effects.

\* The serrated leaves must never be taken on their own. I cannot put into words what horrors that drink causes. Suffice it to say for the record, that two men will never be able to walk straight again, and another will need to be fitted for a glass eye. (Requisition a glass eye for Private Hopper)

\* As I found out, the blue nuts have the effect of scrambling your brain into the most ridiculous nonsense. Perhaps these can be weaponized, or used to punish renegade cooks.

I am holding out hope that we will find a proper substitute, but the soldiers are starting to mumble. It must be soon.

Day 48

The search parties have returned once more. This time they have brought back no new things to try. I have let them return to their regiments, but swore them to secrecy. Hopefully, they didn't tell their friends about the

**Day 480**

**The former twat who was writing in this record lied about what day it was. We've been here for much longer than he said. And he's been experimenting on us since day one. He lied about the coffee and tea just running out. He purposefully dumped some of the rations so we'd have to drink his concoctions. Well, we've dealt with that now, and he's where he belongs. Digging latrines.**

**The problem of no coffee and tea remains, but we are testing new combinations. Carefully. On willing volunteers. The search continues. Someday we will be successful.**
