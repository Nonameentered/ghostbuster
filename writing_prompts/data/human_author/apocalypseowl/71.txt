The first day of winter has come.

And her mother awaits outside my house. A frail, sickly, and evil looking woman. She transforms into an equally decrepit looking fox with nine tails, few of which still have healthy fur. She demands her daughter. And my flesh. Whatever she has been through has ruined her. She's frothing at the mouth as she speaks, and her eyes dart around everywhere like crazy. The kumiho-kid does not move towards her mother. She snarls instead. The creature does not approach at first, but she starts looking less and less stable. Like she cannot pick between fox and woman. At last, with a snarl, she lunges, not as either or, but as a horrid mass of flesh, fur, and teeth. I had feared death, and this creature, whatever she had become, could bring it to me. The kid, my daughter, transforms her claws and rips at the cancerous flesh, while I raise my grandfather's old shotgun. Double-barrel. And loaded with FRAG-12 shells. Explosive shells. I grab the kid and fling her back, where she lands safely on her transformed paws. As I fire the shells, I think that it is times like these that I am glad I live relatively isolated. The recoil almost knocks me down, and the force of the explosive shells kills the horrid mound of flesh. Splattering it all over everything. At my feet I hear a whimpering, and I throw away the gun, to pick up my daughter. I carry her inside, and give her a bath, before wrapping her fox body in warm and dry blankets, the way she likes it. I then head back outside, with a shovel in hand, to bury what remains. I knew this would happen. The girl had for weeks refused the human flesh. She didn't want to become like her mother. Or so she'd said when I'd tried to get her to talk. That was all I needed to know. Even if it killed me, it would have been right to help the kid. After I'm done, I go back inside, and console the kid. She deserves a parent who'd do that. Who'd give their life to grant them a better future.

Because that's what a parent should do.
