We lost a third of our men to that continued assault. A hundred highly trained experts. Elites of the FBMR. And I had to write 35 letters of condolence to 35 wives or husbands, and who knows how many kids. It might have gone on like that, but by dawn we were running out of ammo. I gave the order to affix bayonets, hoping to charge at them, maybe that would confuse them, allow at least some of us to get down to the vehicles, drive out of here, report back our findings. Maybe that would have been the end, but the moment I gave the order to open the door to the church, was the moment the clouds cleared for a little bit. Allowing the first golden rays of the morning sun to illuminate our battleground. And the monsters, they hated it. They flailed and screeched and looked like they felt their own accursed skin burning. The soldiers were no better. All writhing like the sun hurt them somehow. We used that as an opportunity, and killed them. Stabbed our bayonets into their rotten carcases until their torsos had more holes than Swiss cheese.

I have no idea what they were. I know that they seem like some kind of vampire, and their obvious inability to directly assault the church plus their weakness to the sun does lead some credence to that theory. But if that is the case, how the Hell did they end up in Iowa? We just killed them got the heck out of there, and once I'd made my report, you guys told me to come by in the morning for a special debriefing. That's about all I can say about that. Sorry.

**Special debriefing; FBI Internal Notes.**

*Enclosed is an informal interview with Captain John Morris of the FBMR's emergency response unit after an altercation with what CPT Morris claimed to be vampires.

Documents from pre-nuclear war indicates that (INFORMATION REDACTED) research station, Iowa, did contain the only known remnants of the paranormal WWII Wunderwaffe captured in March 1945 called PROJEKT BLUTFEUER. All remaining samples and inactive vampiric test subjects terminated by incineration, as per President Johnson's Purification Protocols in regards to unethical Pentagon-Wall Street clique pre-war research. FBMR Emergency Response Unit given Epsilon-1 Class Memory Reconstruction, minimal interference, to ensure team's mental well-being and prevention of information leakage.*
