It is a classic scene. Across literature, theatre, cinema, and other higher forms of entertainment, it is something one can frequently become acquainted with. There stands the Hero, a pillar of the culture, norms, and people he represents, and across him there we find his antithesis, someone who stands against the established society. The Villain. In this specific case it is a Superhero, and a Supervillain. One is clad in positive bright colours, the other is clad in cold greys and deep black. In stories, the villain is usually defeated and the hero, and the values he represents, are victorious either morally or completely. But this time seems different somehow. Where is the gloating, the drama, the theatrics that usually follow such battles of physical force and mental will? Something has quite clearly changed.

Look at the superhero. Yes, his spandex uniform is still bright and colourful, but it has seen better days. Where one usually expects a stoic look upon the chiselled god-like face of the hero in question, a face that never betrays fear or weakness, one can today find a look of doubt. A tired look, an unshaven, stressed look. With deep bags underneath the tired eyes. And look at the face of the villain in turn. No gleeful gloating, no arrogant smirk, not even a vicious grin upon the face that epitomises the very concept of evil. What has happened, to change our expectations around in such a way?

Let us hear what they are talking about. Let us look closely at them as their confrontation continues.

''*Not today, please, Doctor Terminus, please.*'' The Hero, known in his country and city as the Sentinel implores. ''*I don't want to fight you today, but I will. I have to.*'' The villain, Doctor Terminus, PhD, sighs. ''*For them?*'' He motions with his arm out towards the many onlookers to this fight. Some of them are taking pictures. Others are eating snacks. A few are waving signs around. The Sentinel says nothing, only looks around, frantically looking for someone, but he doesn't find them. Perhaps they were delayed. ''*If its her you're looking for, don't bother. She's on national television, on a TV-show talking about it. She's already writing a goddamn tell-it-all book.*'' The Sentinel's hands are balled into tight fists, strong enough to crush practically anything. But he doesn't move. He doesn't start. ''*You've done so much for them. So damn much. And this is how you're repaid. A girlfriend who is more interested in making money off of you, a public who keeps putting themselves in danger at best. At worst, they're down there protesting you.*'' The Sentinel looks down at some of the onlookers. A number of them are carrying signs that they're shaking around vigorously. The signs talk about ''Genetick Abomanations r freaks'' or ''Not my hero!'' or ''Deport Sentinel!''

Doctor Terminus looks at them with disdain. ''*They're weak. And they're scared. For all you've done for them, they should crawl on their knees worshipping you like a god, but instead you get this! And corrupt TV-evangelists in megachurches talking about how you're the antichrist. Fucking masses, if it weren't for you this planet might have been destroyed a thousand times over the last 10 years you've been operating. Don't you want to go a little feral, to be a villain, against those who treat you like that?*'' The Sentinel looks like he's trying to make a counterargument, but what can he counter with? They hate him. He has stopped meteors, he has found cures for alien zombie viruses, prevented a demonic invasion, helped set up food kitchens, ensured corrupt bureaucrats and politicians wouldn't sell stuff like the city's water to unethical biogeneticists. And what has he gotten in exchange? Hate, rejection, fear, and isolation. The prime ingredients for a villain.

''*The masses hate you. Because you're harder, better, faster, and stronger than them, like the damn Daft Punk song. You're smart too. They hate that. They want everyone to be bland, boring, and frankly moronic. Society is heading towards damn Harrison Bergeron territory now, and frighteningly fast.*'' Doctor Terminus walks slowly towards the Sentinel, at first the superhero is about to defend himself, but instead, the older villain embraces him in a fatherly hug. ''*You deserve better than them my boy. Maybe not to be worshipped, but loved, treated with some damn respect. You are who you are, and you don't have to hide it.*'' The Sentinel is shocked by the sudden move. Initially he is confused, but when he was younger, and Doctor Terminus was a hero, the older man was the closest thing he had to a father. ''*I... I don't understand it. Why do they hate so freely, what have I done to offend them so?*'' The older villain sighs, and just holds him tight for a moment. The Sentinel, tired, overworked, and unloved, feels his eyes watering.

''*They're idiots. And they hate everyone who isn't as base, stupid, weak, and petty as they are. Don't you wonder why I became a villain in the first place?*'' The Sentinel sniffles for a bit, holding back the tears slightly. ''*You were refused from completing a dangerous experiment, right?*'' Doctor Terminus chuckles a bit. And then lets the hug go as he begins to laugh heartily. It's the first sign of joy the Sentinel has seen from the old man in years. When he finally stops he puts a fatherly hand on the hero's shoulder. ''*No. I wasn't stopped because the experiment was dangerous. It was stopped, the funding pulled, and my reputation destroyed because reactionary groups, several of them extremely religious and conservative, complained that I was tampering with the work of god, that it was unethical to work with genetics in such a way.*'' The Sentinel, knowing well the kind of groups, who are fonts of utter hatred and corruption that drags the name of the lord through the mud at the best of times, and through the pigsty on bad days, asks the question. ''*What was the purpose of the experiments then?*'' Doctor Terminus looks into the sky, nostalgic for days gone by perhaps. ''*Curing all genetic diseases. No more kids dying because of progeria, or early cancer. No more type-1 diabetes, no more Huntington.*''

''*And they stopped it, so you became a supervillain?*'' He shrugs, and points at some of the people watching them, many of them are now actively booing. ''*That, and because I was in the same place you were. Hated and despised. So I left the hero gig. And became a supervillain. Because I understood that if the morality I fought for desired the death of children, then it was time to begin what Nietzsche termed the transvaluation of values. I began exalting life and joy over suffering and death. I accepted my instincts of what is right and what is wrong, over the taught ideas of right and wrong. I rejected the world that had rejected me; And set forth to create my own morality.*'' He looks around conspiratorially, and then adds in a whispered tone; ''*The masses also burned down my lab and destroyed my work, making nearly 15 years worth of studying and research go up in smoke, so fuck them.*''

The Sentinel ponders this. His girlfriend betrayed him, his citizenship has been revoked, the city he has spent years of his life protecting from madmen, aliens, demons, demonic alien madmen, and international crime, hates him. ''*But... isn't it wrong?*'' He tries one last time, one final time. A final attempt to hold on to his previous held notions of morality, in the increasingly convincing evidence that he should just take over the world. ''*Sentinel, you built a machine that could halt climate change while they got their pollution issues under control and rather than using it, they took it apart and used it as the base for a better AC unit that they're now selling around the country. They never even reassembled the original and used it. You gave them the means to save the world, to fix their own fuck-ups. They disregarded its use and built a machine from it to maximize profits instead. And the masses then complained that you weren't fixing climate change for them. They're garbage. The mob, the masses, the people on the street; They're assholes.*''
