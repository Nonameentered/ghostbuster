However, that is what the other condottieri, his colleagues one might say, would count as Willowlight's greatest achievement. The dragon himself counts a different victory as greater than any other. The victory of his way, over the old ways. He knew he wasn't the only dragon to break the mould, and act differently. There were others. Some had entered finance sectors, a few had become adventurers in distant lands, or so he'd heard. But some were coming down the mountains to seek him out. Two came to him, in the dead of night, acting shyly, non-threateningly, and begging to be shown the measure of his worth. He allowed them into the castle that he once been granted by a king who had little gold, but plenty of land. They saw his massive hoard of treasure, or at the very least the hoard he didn't keep in a dragon-owned bank, and they did what he had never done to the elder dragons. They bowed their heads, touching the earth before him with their snouts, followed by them rolling onto their backs, exposing their comparatively softer underbellies. It meant that they were so willing to obey him, that they would let him kill them here and now. It would only take a single swipe of his sharpened claws. It was only two of them at the start, but the message was clear. Submission. Completely and utterly. They acknowledged him as superior, as a dragon of equal rank to the eldest of their kindred.

It was what he had refused to do himself. Now others were coming to him, seeking to accept his primacy. He resolved to do differently by them. None of the old-fashioned stuff, where they'd hunt for him and obey his eccentric insanities. He took those two in, and began to teach them things he had learned. How to detect magic arrows meant to pierce dragon flesh. How to make antidotes for the, very few, poisons that can harm dragons. How to obey orders, but also think creatively in a battle situation where orders aren't as important as initiative. He taught them discipline. He explained tactics, how to lead mortal human soldiers if need be. He took them in, as they were; young, weak, meek, and beaten down by their elders. And he made them his soldiers; Strong, cunning, capable, and assured. And when he next was hired to do battle for some king, he brought those two other dragons with him. The three of them clad in armour, shimmering in the sunlight, practically won the battle all on their own.

He gave himself the rank of captain, and who'd object to that, and made the two of them his lieutenants. Lt. Smoking-Sea, and Lt. Sky-Seer. He figured that they would be needed for the future, and indeed, they were. Soon enough, on their lonesome or in pairs, young dragons who did not want to serve underneath the iron claws of the elders, came to become part of Willowlight's warband. They were trained, taught of the ways of mortals and how dragons could use those ways to gain wealth. And how, when, and why they'd obey the laws of mortals when living in their parts of the world. These dragons were changed by Willowlight and his ideas. And he kept changing things. All loot taken and wealth earned was gathered and distributed fairly according to rank, instead of hoarded for himself. Which meant that a smaller dragon, who wasn't particularly good at fighting, became a very happy quartermaster. No dragon would have to be a servant for other dragons, that was what the many well-paid humans who maintained Willowlight's castle was for. Unlike back in the mountains, there would be no prima noctis either, for those dragons who have joined together. And by-and-large, it worked. Dragons have never had military discipline before. They have only ever had the hierarchy of strength and age. The largest and the oldest ruled, over he weaker, and the younger. Now it was a different hierarchy. One where merit determines everything. It made them into the most terrifying, disciplined, and well-coordinated group of dragons in history.

One must shudder to see it, when a group of dragons all clad in armour move as one unit, saluting with synchronised speed.

And today, Captain Willowlight, mature, scarred, and battle-hardened, fights in another war for more money. More wealth for his way of life as a modern dragon. Wars might be changing though, and these new cannons will be trouble in a couple of decades he expects. And their jobs are changing too. He has gotten offers of having some of his dragons act as bodyguards for diplomats and merchants. Others are hiring his dragons to train their soldiers, which pays excellently into the collective hoard as well. Of course, he accepts all of these jobs, as they are well-paid jobs. The world might be changing, but that is something he is prepared for. The dragons of old, those who still live in the mountains, those who follow the old way, are a dying breed. Those who follow him, or the other modern dragons who have arisen, have accepted change. From the hybrid in the west, to the cunning banker, to the scholar. All of them, and him, changed by interacting with the mortal races, and changed those who learned from them in turn. And now they are all a part of this world's future once more, even if none of them will ever rule it.
