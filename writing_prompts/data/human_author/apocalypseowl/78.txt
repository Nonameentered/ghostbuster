''*Captain, we've caught him. The Rebel Knight.*''

That woke me up. Better than a cold bath for sure. ''*Prepare some food and light ale for me when I get down there. I must get dressed first.*'' The soldier saluted and left my room. I splashed some cold water from the copper basin on top of the dresser on my face, and looked into the polished brass mirror. The Rebel Knight. Unlike most of the nobility, he had stayed behind after the Empire moved in. He'd gone into the hills with a few of his loyal retainers. Acted as a leading figure of rebellion for the remaining dispossessed upper class, who had gone into exile or been reduced to poverty. Capturing him had been made an important mission for the pacification of the Archduchy of Landgren. If it was ever to be pacified and brought under complete imperial control, then no organised rebellion should be allowed to exist. Afterwards, rebuilding the land, indoctrinating the locals to imperial teachings and teaching local youth in imperial schools, that could commence in earnest. As long as a rebellion existed though, that effort to rebuild and integrate the area would not be successful. Raids on supply caravans, attacks on collaborators, assassinations of imperial civilians, it would all continue.

Couldn't have that.

I left my room after dressing, and was followed by two of the guardsmen down to the dungeon. There he was in a cell. The plan had worked perfectly then. The trap had been quite good. Sending off some of our troops to look in the wrong areas while a transport full of arms and armour would move through the area where the Rebel Knight and his men had set up a temporary base. It was good bait, and he took it. Inside was arms and armour true enough. Wielded by Imperial Legionnaires. Must have been one hell of a fight, judging by the knight. I remember how he looked before the Empire invaded. An imposing and impressive figure. Long flowing hair, a strong jawline, stern eyes. Perfect smile too. Now, with a swollen black eye, some lost teeth, and more than a few ugly scars, he looked less impressive. He stared at me through the one good eye and was shocked to recognise me. ''*You!*'' I nodded, yup, it's me. I sat down in front of him, as the guards handed me a sandwich and some light ale in a mug. I took a few bites and some sips while looking at him, watching him grow angrier because I disregarded him in favour of a meal. It's good to make them angry, they're more likely to say something that they shouldn't have said when they're angry.

He scowls at me, and then opens his mouth to speak again. ''*I thought better of you, you know. Your father was loyal, forged for me my first blade.*'' I remember that. Old dad was a blacksmith. And a bit of a coward. Whenever the lords came by it was all simpering and downcast eyes. No pride. ''*It was a good blade, sir knight. I helped him with the bellows on that.*'' I liked working in the forge, with dad, he was always so very willing to learn and to teach. He scowls again. Not a good look on him. ''*And now you've dishonoured his memory by joining up with the evil emperor. Become his local lapdog.*'' I shrugged. Sure, the emperor had cast down thrones and killed nobles a plenty. Sacrificed a good number of them to dark things for power too. Didn't bother sacrificing the serfs, just freed them and told them to work the land, pay their taxes, and otherwise stay put. ''*Well, I hope you're happy with yourself. The duchy is dying, the noble castles are being torn down, and the tombs of my ancestors have been plundered of their wealth. My family has fled this land, and so have most of those noble lines that had the option.*''

I put down my sandwich slowly and deliberately. ''*It's true I suppose. The grandiose castles have been torn down, their materials used to create hospitals and schools. The tombs of your ancestors have been emptied of wealth, so that it might be used to pay for food to the starving masses after the siege of the capital ended. Such a sad state of affairs.*'' I look at him with a cold steady gaze. ''*And joining the imperial army ensured medical assistance to my poor father, whom you claim I have dishonoured. By the hands of an imperial apothecary, they removed the tumour growing inside of him, so now he can be alive to feel dishonoured. I believe that's fair enough.*'' He looks away for a moment. Then stares back at me. ''*So, they've paid you well for your betrayal of your homeland. Good for you.*'' I shuffle some papers detailing what is to be done to him. He has been caught. We know where his bases are. His men are leaderless. The rebellion will fall. And the Empire will pacify this region, and then shift their forces here to the main front against the remaining kingdoms. Local guardsmen will keep the peace and ensure imperial compliance with standard culture and laws.

''*Loyalty to a homeland is easier when there is something in it for you. What would I have been loyal to? The lords who bound me to the land? The anvil my father worked on his entire life for next to nothing? The small house where my mother died of a curable disease, the medicine was illegal because of the rules of faith and tradition in this land? The small house where I, the oldest son, had to raise five siblings while my father worked all day and all night? Some nebulous obligation to my liege?*'' I shake my head. No. Loyalty is earned. And is reciprocal. You grant your underlings benefits; you receive loyal underlings. You treat people like the worms in the dirt, and you should not be surprised that they rise up against you given the chance. ''*Loyalty was earned by the emperor. He has given me wealth I could not have earned working a thousand years in the smithy. He has given me the freedom to move around anywhere in his empire I so desire, even to his dark capital. He has given me responsibilities as a Captain of the Landgren Garrison of the Imperial Legion, and I serve willingly for I was promoted for my abilities. Not for my bloodline. And of course, my youngest sister who has magical abilities is now enrolled in the local chapter of the imperial thaumaturgical academy down in the city. Under the rule of the old duke, she would have been burned as a witch. Tell me, Sir Knight, what loyalty did I ever owe to you and the old order?*''

He looks at me for a moment. He wants to say something, I can tell. But he pauses. Considers it. Rejects it. Realises something. And then begins to talk. ''*Even if I had managed to rally enough rebels, and retaken Landgren, I couldn't have kept it. The people would never have agreed to go back to the way things were.*'' I nod. Around me are guardsmen who would have spent the rest of their lives ignorant and working as serfs. The lowest kind of peasant. Now they've got a good education, a chance to earn a good promotion, an offer of a one-time bonus at the end of their time of service consisting of either newly conquered land to be their property, or two years worth of pay. And if they die in the line of duty, their widows get a 10 year period of grace, where they receive 80% of their spouse's wage. Orphans are taken in by the army as well, given training and education. Old temples that once housed corpulent and corrupt priests have been turned into housing and quarantine buildings. Anyone can rise in the ranks of the empire, as long as they're competent enough. The Empire leaves no-one behind in the emperor's single-minded conquest of the entire world. If the crowned heads of the world must be crushed underneath the iron heel of the emperor, then it is best to have the loyalty of the people on your side. ''*The people are no longer serfs. No longer bound to the land. The world has turned upside down; the old order of the ruling nobility of blood and honour has been replaced by common men working tirelessly to bring the emperor's new order to every corner of the world. And to gain our loyalty, he has given us everything we could dream of, and more.*''
