It is helping them.

One doesn't have to ask who ''it'' is. Everyone knows. Everyone has heard. Everyone has seen it. A being from beyond time and space, a creature unbound by conventions, the laws of physics, something that isn't a person, but a cosmic fact with a will of its own. The Judge. It has eaten gods, it has burned worlds, it has destroyed empires. It tests the mettle of all who manage to leave their home system by artificial means. It is a gruelling test, never the same, always different. The Judge examines every world's history, their cultures, their natures, and forces them to be true to themselves to complete the test. Those who succeed, who overcome their flaws and show their better natures, are allowed to continue to develop. To create an interstellar empire of their own. Those who fail are sent back on the evolutionary scale, their nations dismantled, their world reforged, allowing another race to rise on their homeworld, that might one day ascend and be tested instead. Most succeed. Rare indeed is the world that fails.

There is no bargaining, there is no threatening, no intimidating, no wealth, no ruin, nothing satisfies the Judge except the completion of its test. It is beyond the scopes of our understanding. Of any race known to the general galactic community. The Interstellar High Council, and the associated archives going back millions of years, have records of every race and their encounters with the Judge. Every success, every test, every failure. Everyone who has managed to contact it. Everyone who has been annihilated for insulting it with the petty ambitions of mortal races. Everyone who has been de-evolved for daring to do something so foul and debased as worshipping the Judge. It's all in there. But this has never happened in recorded memory. This has never been seen before. And all of the known areas of the universe, in our galaxy and the others whom we can only speak to, as intergalactic travel hasn't been successful yet; every powerful individual, important organisation, nation-state, empire, and religion, is asking themselves a simple question; How?

How did they get the single most eldritch creature, a thing that is simultaneously measured as being merely the size of an average sentient lifeform, and the size of a small galaxy, to help them? How did a fractured, disorganised, uncooperative planet of little cretins with no central government, get the single most powerful and dangerous entity in creation to help them? To come to their world, guiding them, teaching them, helping them see the best path to rebuilding their dying world, and then getting it put into action? Usually it hinders and stalls development, until the arbitrary demands it has put on the tested species have been fulfilled. Of course, asking it directly is impossible. Unless it is supremely important to speak with it, one should never dare to contact it. As it does not suffer unimportant fools making demands of it. Only in the rarest of circumstances should it ever be acknowledged at all.

And yet many look upon these humans, on their little world of dirt and grime. They wonder, why does the Judge care for them? Why should anyone care for them at all? Who would care at all for that little race, when they could be conquered instead, and put under the solid iron boot of a strong central government? Why should anyone care for them, when they are not of the same flesh as stronger, more powerful empires? They are flawed, silly things. And the Judge still helps them. Still teaches them, still cares for their world like a mother for her child. They are not united in glorious purpose. They do not desire conquest and dominion. They are capable of cruelty, but it is a childish form of cruelty done for reasons that are personal at best. They do not churn countless millions into the dust for sake of efficiency; they do it because they don't know any better. They don't understand how a proper, strong government, should rule.

Perhaps that is why the Judge care for them in such a manner, the empires around that insignificant world would like nothing better than to subdue it, to conquer it, for blood, glory, and strength.

That is the great weakness, of all the nations of the universe. Mankind, on their little world, with their little flaws, and little mistakes, have not succumbed to autocracy and tyranny. Not entirely. There are cabals, tyrants, greedy rich fools, and other scum who keep trying to force mankind to become a singular, uniform race. Yet despite all those who desire for mankind to become obedient soldiers and workers slaving and dying for the ruling class; there are still those who fight back. There are still those who believe in decency, in working together because it is right, not merely because there is an enemy. Humanity is a free species. Humanity, despite all the cruel, corrupt, and malignant menaces that they have to deal with, still marches discordantly and sometimes with a good couple of steps in entirely the wrong direction, towards freedom, decency, and progress.

That is what the Judge has seen. Alone amidst all the nations of the cosmos, only mankind is so chaotic and self-destructive as to retain an attempt at freedom and liberty. The Judge, alien and strange, eldritch and bizarre, sat itself in human flesh upon the human world, in an attempt to understand mankind. It failed utterly and completely. But it learned things it never could have dreamed of. Compassion, art, revelry, actual love, friendship. These things can be found on many worlds, but they are always subsumed into a worship of the state, a desire for obedience, and a lack of personal dignity. The Judge found that only on Earth is there the option of standing against the current. Only on Earth, where mankind have committed several mistakes and atrocities, is there hope for a future, and those willing to fight the mainstream, the faith, and the state to get a future worth living in. The Judge only stayed human for a single lifetime, but it experienced more unabated joy, more sorrow, more love, more silliness, more confusion, and more curiosity than it had experienced since the universe began.
