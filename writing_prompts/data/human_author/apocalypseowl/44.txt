In the past, it has been found that local cultures on Earth had amazing remedies for diseases, and if people would only listen to them, they could have cured a lot of diseases faster. Kinin, as extracted from the bark of a certain tree, was an functional natural remedy for malaria for years, and once people realised this, many regions managed to put an end to that horrible malady. The human doctors, nurses, and medtechs all knew this, and tested every remedy they found, in case they had a potential easy cure for something local and highly deadly on the occupied planet. They found nothing. For some reason, bathing regularly, washing hands, and just not living in animal and people filth, was completely and utterly alien to the extra-terrestrials. It is not for nothing that the beak-masks, inspired by plague-doctor masks of the olden days, have built in silencers. It's for the doctors to use so they can scream in utter rage that people could be so mind-numbingly stupid as they experience.

On every world, the people are inoculated. On every world, the understandably small population is cured. On every world human teachers are following the doctors, teaching the aliens about how to farm better. How to live without constant stomach issues. How to listen to people who know what they're doing instead of self-righteous autocrats. After all, if the human race did the same, casting down all their unjustly rich, their despotic regimes, and their insane churches, then others can do as mankind. They can have democracy. They can have economic and social prosperity without exploitation. They can have faith based on community, camaraderie, and coexistence. Sure, the adults of those worlds that mankind have taken and are furiously scrubbing clean of potential infection vectors and regular disgusting medieval lifestyles aren't listening. But the youth of those worlds, will see how they'll grow up healthy, well-fed, and educated. And the cycle will not continue in those alien children.

They'll practically worship their saviours. They'll want to be like them. In time, they'll grow up, and with the human educations they'll become nurses, doctors, paramedics, medical technicians, and other professions involved with the welfare and wellness of the body. They'll go to distant worlds and save aliens who have yet to learn how reality works. They'll dress in the same beak-masks, in the same white biocontainment suits. And they'll save millions of lives. All thanks to the efforts of the United Earth Government, the GHO(*Galactic Health Organisation*), and various NGOs such as Médecins Sans Frontières Dans L'espace, the Red Hearts(*Formerly Red Cross, Red Moon, etc*), the Neo-Hospitallers, and countless other medical and education organisations.

That isn't to say that mankind is perfect. And there are many places where the human race is doing some quite questionable things. The less said about what is done to the former ruling classes, who are taken to certain planets where mankind have laboratories, the better. The fact that the mechanical servant caste has been taken to the human shipyards and are being taught how to make human ships, is a cause for worry if they can't be genetically redesigned to do anything else than building spaceships. And the fact that mankind is destroying cultures, making themselves rulers of alien worlds, is not great either. With the best of intentions, to cure diseases, to teach aliens not to live like pigs, mankind has strayed from their former path of peace and liberty. Once more, mankind walks down the path towards an imperium. A united Earth, as a seat of an empire. It might not come about today. It might not come about in a year. But when all the old regimes have been reduced to ash, when the old faiths worshipping illnesses as the will of the gods have been destroyed through thorough re-educations. That's when it comes.

The day when the aliens think human. Dress human. Act human. And talk human. That's when the imperium can begin. A galactic empire of humans, where the idea of an alien life is practically gone forever, because there is only human culture, human ideas, and human thoughts left, no matter the shape or evolutionary origin of the human in question. That's what lies at the end of the path if mankind cannot realise this in time.
