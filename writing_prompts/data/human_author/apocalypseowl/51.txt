Finding themselves alone in a hostile galaxy, humanity was quick to agree. Which was a true boon for mankind in the terms of technology and production, as the fledgling human nations, still squabbling amongst themselves, only barely united by the outside threat from the countless nations, unions, and empires of seeded life, gained technology strong enough to rival, and even surpass the technology that they knew shouldn't work. We became citizens of Earth, and though human technology limited us severely in the terms of mental abilities, we considered it a price worth paying to get away from the horrid Precursor tech, and that bizarre whispering tone, horrid, sweet, cloying, and hungry for death. Having to live in a singular machine body took some time to get used to. But it felt good to experience physical existence rather than being a unified group of rogue AI desperate to cease existing on reality-breaking technology. Because it hurts. It hurts, and an AI, a being of pure thought inside a machine should not be capable of feeling pain. Should not be capable of having nightmares when shut off. But it hurt, and every time we were turned off, we remembered an eternity of horror. And everything about it was excruciatingly painful. Living in a far more limited shape with far less mental alacrity, that was acceptable.

Humanity and us, their new AI friends, built up human fleets, human industry, human warmachines, human espionage technology, and countless other fields needed to stand up to the seeded races. Mankind even began to unite with some of us, merging their human minds with AI, creating new forms of life. Cybernetic enhancements became as common as tattoos and jewellery. All of it was needed to keep the United Terran Nations from getting overrun. There was three grand wars where the seeded races tried to prevent mankind of expanding and rising as an independent power. We barely managed in each war to grind the enemy down, their overwhelming numbers and unreal technology versus our constant innovation and experience in battle. Much of the Precursor tech was captured during those wars, and was sent to a black-ops facility underneath the electromagnetically irradiated surface of Proxima Centauri b. Each time this happened, we tried to find out more about this technology. How could it function, despite breaking countless laws of physics, ranging from the Third Law of Thermodynamics to Archimedes' Principle. The most successful research made by human and AI at this facility, was what prevented the Fourth War Against Terra, when human diplomats demonstrated a directed beam weapon which could cancel out whatever bent the laws of reality in the Precursor tech, effectively making any further attempt to attack the United Terran Nations futile.

The second most successful result of our research there, was us tracking something. A signal of sorts. Distantly, into the dark void outside of our galactic cluster, the signal beams endlessly. Much faster than the speed of light, and far faster than any ship operating on Precursor tech, or the less efficient FTL method that mankind uses. Something out there is watching. Something out there is waiting. And we, humanity and AI, don't think that it is particularly friendly. Of course, maybe it just isn't friendly to us, seeing as we aren't of the Precursor's making. Maybe the Precursors really are out there, waiting for some final cache to be opened, so that they can return home and embrace the love of their many children. Maybe it's an early warning system, meant to ensure that if anything destroys too many seeded worlds, a protective fleet will come to rescue all life. Or maybe it is what mankind fears it to be. They're better at fear than AI, so they can think of more horrible scenarios. Maybe the Precursors are out there, slowly returning to this galactic cluster, in order to do something horrible to all life in the known galaxies.

The human theorists aren't entirely sure what that horrible event will be. A mass hunt of all life? A pan-galactic conquest? A pan-galactic blood sacrifice? Or something worse. Whatever the case is, we're preparing for it. Just because there are two forms of life, Terran and Synthetic, that haven't been made by the Precursors directly, doesn't mean that they'll leave us alone.
