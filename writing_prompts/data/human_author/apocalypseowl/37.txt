Professionals have standards. That's what separates your average two-bit schmuck from the real big fellas. You might look at some goon clad in bright spandex talking about how great they are. Yeah, usually that's just some egotist who has misunderstood Nietzsche to a comical degree. They're all talking about how unrestrained from society they are, how crazy and unpredictable their actions seem, when they've surely got some masterplan. I'll let you in on a little secret; those morons are the most predictable, pathetic, annoying losers in villainy. Everyone thinks they're going to be the next damn Joker, but in reality, they're just a cheap, forgettable, dumbass in an ill-fitting and unflattering suit. You look at them, and you think to yourself, ''gee, who is this clown?'' Because they're just that, a run-of-the-mill clown. A real professional, has standards. A real villain, has class. Style even. Immaculate outfits, a calm, cold, and stern demeanour. They know what they're doing at all times, and they can turn any situation to their advantage somehow. And they don't do their work just for the damn attention, unless it's a part of the plan.

Usually, when I go after the Guild of Heroes, it's to distract from my real plan. While I duke it out with those latex-loving do-gooders, my team of highly trained professionals recover a priceless piece of arcane technology from the government or some competitor. And while I tell some guy in a flashy cape that his days are numbered, my scientists takes the doodad apart, figures out what makes it tick, makes a copy, and then we put it back again, and nobody notices. Six months later my front companies release something amazing based on it. That's how I got those holographic home emitters on the market so fast. Like those ones from that Star Trek show. Of course the programs, games, and holovids we sell for it are very good and very affordable to the consumer, making us a metric tonne of good, mostly legal, money. And then the heroes all shake their fists to the sky as I escape once again after foiling my attempt to steal the Mona Lisa or something like that.

It's not that they don't legitimately foil me from time to time. Always annoying when they find some lab where I'm testing military grade cybernetics, intended to be used on dissenters in third world countries to create an army of brainwashed and loyal soldiers for some tin-pot dictator. Or when one of them infiltrates one of the genetic laboratories I own, releases something that was never supposed to have been made in the first place, forcing me to hire a truly astounding amount of lawyers to keep my ass out of prison. It's frustrating. It's financially draining. And it pisses me off enough that I usually wind up having to kill some of their clones to cool off. So what, I have an anger problem, and yoga just ain't cutting it, and killing minions or interns is a good way to only have really stupid minions and interns in your organisation. I'd feel a little bad about it afterwards too. Yeah, I have a cloning program, but I'm not stupid enough to clone anyone with powers granted to them by their genetics. That's just asking for trouble.

Now, some of ya might be wondering, why am I not doing more to fuck the heroes up? I get it, I've been there, really annoying to have to lie in some alien cocoon for weeks to regenerate after having every bone in my body broken. Takes months of surgery afterwards to make me look human again too. Really makes a guy want to pay them back somehow, yeah? Now I might be a bastard. But I'm also a professional. Outside of work, I don't necessarily hate them. I think they should stick to killing extra-terrestrial invaders and putting violent superthugs and joker-knockoffs in prison, of course. Let businessmen do their business in peace. Because when some alien demon-god comes here to sacrifice mankind to their ancestors or some crap like that, heroes are real useful to have around. They go beat up the mean ol' alien, mankind is saved, parties all around, the villains get a 30 minute head start if we helped them defend the Earth, it's all good. Now, I might want to crush some of their skulls sometimes, but I have to admit, that we'd be royally up that nasty creek with no paddle if it weren't for them.

That's just professionalism, you know. Some people however, might want to ask me, ''Boss, why don't ya take their families, show them you mean business?'' And there is a good reason for that. First off, those heroes, when in stress, become *way* more open to breaking the law whenever those people that they love are in danger. You kidnap some speedster's dear ol' mum from her home? Well, you better be prepared to spend the rest of your life in a wheelchair. If you're lucky. You show some strong hero a picture you took of his kid's school, you better be prepared for them not to hold back. You'll be eating your dinners for the rest of your life from a straw. If you ever wake up from the coma that fella is going to put you in. Who is going to prosecute the hero for that? Nobody. That's who. No judge would ever preside over the case, not even the most corrupt lawyers would take it.

That's just the pragmatic reasons though. Nobody wants to be on the receiving end of a beatdown from a hero desperate enough to kill. No lads, ladettes, and the delightful cavalcade of others who don't fit into either. Whenever someone asks me why I don't hurt my worst enemy's wife and kids, it's because of a lot of reasons. Despite our rivalry, I respect the man. He's self-made, he doesn't take shit, he doesn't do bribes, and he'll keep a deal always. Even though he hates me, I know that when the chips are down, the world comes to shit, and I offer to make amends to save mankind, he'll bury the goddamn hatchet in an instant. Because he is a good man. I ain't. I am a tough bastard. And there is a mutual, begrudging respect. I think he's an idealistic utopian fool, but I, in the strangest of ways trust him to be what he is. He thinks I am a mean bastard, greedy, arrogant, and rich. And he's right. I am all that. Yet, he's trusted me before, and will probably do so again.

I ain't going to break that. He's one of the strongest and most determined people on the planet. If I broke the trust, the begrudging respect between us, by going after the people he loves, then maybe when the world is threatened next time, he won't accept my necessary help. And mankind will go extinct. I hope I don't have to explain to anyone here why that's bad, and if anyone thinks that's a great idea, I'll have you know that I have a team of twelve sharpshooters ready to assassinate any of you who so much as entertain the idea that extinction could be fun. Of course, the fact that the fella there in the front row just had his head explode means that he thought about it. Because I also have a wizard on my list of employees. Great guy, does amazing work with fireworks, surprisingly decent chef, and can explode the minds of anyone who wants mankind dead. Really worth his pay.

Of course, maybe the more impulsive, more ''edgy'' younger villains don't give a shit about any of that. Maybe so. But I ain't just a leading man in the businesses of supervillainy, mad science, medicine, cybernetics, and entertainment. I am also a parent. Do you think I could go home after work, having harmed my archnemesis through his family, and just pick up my little girl, putting her to bed, reading some book about dragons and lady knights to get her to sleep? Do you think I could look my son in the eyes, when I am listening to him explain his hobbies, his art? Do you think I could lay down next to my wife, on our expensive bed in our immaculate mansion, and just be a father and husband after that? I couldn't do that. Some moron who thinks they're the Ãœbermensch without understanding the concept at all might harm a person by harming their kin. Some absolute fuckward might decide that it would be excellent revenge on say, my archnemesis, The Crimson Union Man, to take his family away.

And guess what, if you all would do me the favour of looking up, you'll see the dunderhead who had the galaxy-brain idea of the year. You all hopefully recognise your fellow C-lister villain, Hell Herald. Sure, I've made some adjustments, to show my disapproval. Don't worry about him though, despite evidence to the contrary, he's still alive. We've got his brain hooked up to a machine that'll keep it going even as the body dies around him. Amazingly horrifying to experience, or so I'm told. His wounds are indeed fatal and incredibly painful, but since he was so nice to tell us where he was hiding Union Man's family before they were going to be killed by some cheap explosives, I'll put his brain into a clone. Of course, if he *ever* does something that stupid again, the cloned body is going to explode. Sure, him doing it to the Union Man wasn't going to hurt me at all. After all, it would emotionally and psychologically devastate my worst enemy. But I have standards. And I have respect. Respect costs nothing, but is a great benefit to all, my old man used to say.

Now, I get it, you're all young villains, new kids on the block, eager to be the NEW FIRM of killers, thieves, and destroyers. So just take this as a kindly reminder from your friendly ol' uncle. **If you ever do something like this. Any of you. I'll round the lot of you up, and have you subjected to a form of torment that makes what I've done to Hell Herald seem like a day at the beach, understand?** I can see from all your nodding, smiling faces, drenched as they are in sweat and blood, that the message has been received on planet villain.

So, I'mma head out, y'all have a nice, and profitable, night, all right? Without any shenanigans. After all, I have to meet this guy I respect about reuniting a family.
