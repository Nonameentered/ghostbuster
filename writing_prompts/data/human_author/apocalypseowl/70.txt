Imagine for a moment, that you were looking at the same old world. Same old miseries and joys. Same beauty, much of it tarnished by pollution. Now think that you closed your eyes, just for a brief moment, and when you opened them again, you were standing in paradise. No more polluted oceans, no more mountains of trash. Imagine the change when the hundreds of millions who were poor, sick, and living with no hope for a better future, suddenly found themselves living in beautiful clean apartments, their ailments all cured, the table in front of them stacked with healthy and tasty food. Imagine the animals, out there in the rainforests, watching in awe as the acres of land cut down by greedy human hands to be used to grow livestock feed, soya beans, or palm oil, was restored to their old glory. The weapons in the hands of invaders are gone, and the invasion force has been deposited fifty miles behind the pre-war border, disarmed and with well-made pamphlets describing precisely how their leaders and officers have sold them out to corporate interests in their hands. Very persuasive pamphlets. Good enough to convince anyone to rise up against a regime that believes that human life is disposable. Imagine the uttermost vilest of criminals, the Kims, the Kissingers, the Bezos, and the Putins, all put into a mysterious and inescapable prison built into the sheer wall of the Mariana Trench. All atomic weapons and radioactive waste has been disposed of properly, ensuring that no madman will be able to hold the world hostage under the threat of atomic death raining from the sky.

Decaying and impersonal suburbs have been removed and replaced with forests, while agriculture has been rebuilt to be automated and contained within huge hydroponic farms that can grow food both animal and vegetable, without suffering involved. Shining new cities with perfect AI bureaucracy, AI police that actually spends time tracking down criminals rather than executing civilians, a personal AI therapist for every human being alive who had to experience the past 30 years. Earth's glaciers restored, the ice on Greenland and the Antarctic no longer melting rapidly. The carbon dioxide in the air has been brought down to pre-industrial levels. The Aral sea is once more filled, the droughts around the world are all ended. And Chernobyl is now somewhat less radioactive than most other parts of the planet. All in the merest blink of an eye. Everywhere confused people are suddenly living in luxury, or put into prison if they'd committed real crimes. The existence of all the Home Owners' Associations and other dangerous cults have been erased, just as all coal-based powerplants have been. Instead, mankind finds themselves in paradise. That was all done with super-speed. Speed, faster than any previously thought possible, that allowed the world to be fixed, those who had committed crimes to be put away in jails until they could be given just trials by perfectly objective AI judges, and all the missing people brought home alive or given proper burial according to their known wishes or cultural practices.

Every death camp has been emptied. The foul instigators of such abominable practices, the Eichmanns and Mengeles of the modern world, have been torn apart molecule by molecule; never again shall such practices cast a dark shadow upon the fair Earth. The wounds of the flesh of the inmates have been healed, though the wound to the soul that all those who've passed through such nightmares are not so easily undone. Yet with the help of their personal AI therapist, and the families they've been reunited with, the horrors they've experience will fade and time will grant them rest.

The world was fixed two seconds ago. Though humanity, being humanity, will probably find a way to muck it up soon anyway. That doesn't really matter. I watch them see the new world with awe, fear, and wonder in their faces. I watch as dying junkies suddenly find their bodies completely healed and no longer filled with a chemical dependency. I watch those who were dangerously obese or dangerously thin, find themselves in optimal bodies. Because Super-Speed allows for thoughts at that same speed. In less than a picosecond I had made a plan. In about ten nanoseconds, I had solved every scientific and material problem I could have ever had with completing said plan. I had developed the technology and written the programs necessary to turn the world around. All I had to do was the heavy lifting, which with the speed I was now existing as, was as easy as breathing. Still, took some time, about than twenty microseconds, to convert myself into a nanite swarm that could work efficiently, but it was not entirely unpleasant. And that was all it took. Two full seconds after I initially gained the power of super-speed, I had solved every problem that threatened to destroy the world, though humanity will eventually create more.

I didn't care though. I had done right by mankind. We were just doing some work on an experimental new form of power, that probably would have been buried by the fossil-fuel industry if it had worked out. I had always intended for it to be used to benefit mankind, to help us survive. When I was ''accidentally'' pushed into my own invention by who I have confirmed was a corporate spy, I gained speed that wasn't really comprehensible under our current understanding of physics. I theorize that somehow it unanchored me from the form of time we experience in our universe, and anchored me into a universe where speed has no upper limit. It is somewhat vexing to be in two realities simultaneously, but that was part of what the nanite conversion was for, to allow myself greater control over myself and what I perceive. The other part was to be able to be everywhere on the planet, working at every part of the plan simultaneously and without a single yoctosecond wasted. With everything solved, I can even see how to unanchor myself from the alternate dimension of time, and make myself fully immersed into my native universe once again, though that will mean that my ability to move beyond what is truly comprehensible as speed in the human frame of mind will be beyond me. Though as I will be an immortal nanite swarm in the shape of a man, I will still be able to do some course corrections if the world decides to do something stupid. And thus, I will be able to reverse the procedure if needed.

And once more assume the power and mantle of a proper god, to circumvent the follies of mankind. Hopefully that day will never come. Atop a mountain, inside a newly constructed temple of neon light and chrome, I unmerge my personal time from the alternate universe. I have experienced a billion subjective aeons under the power of super-speed and the fast thoughts that come from it. Now my time is merged with my own universe again, and I find myself tired, my nanite body wanting nothing more than to rest. It is taxing for the mind, even one that was only once biological, and now synthetically ascended. I will rest here; and let humanity, who will learn what I've done from the personal letter they've all received where I've told them how great they are on a personal level, and what I've done for them on a general level, live. And make mistakes, but this time with a clean slate.
