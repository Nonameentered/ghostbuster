''*Didn't figure that there would be anyone on the roof today.*'' She says. I just shrug. ''*They're all participating in that zombie event or whatever.*'' She nods. And reaches out her hand to me. ''*I'd give you my name, but it isn't memorable.*'' I shake her hand and smile, a bit goofily. ''*That's funny, I've got the same problem. My parents keep forgetting my name unless they've got my birth certificate with them to check.*'' Letting go of her hand, we look up into the blue sky, where countless helicopters are leaving, some with what has to be mannequin zombies holding on.

''*I think I should just call you boy then.*'' That's as good a name as any other, even it is just a common descriptor that can be applied to any young male. ''*Would you mind if I call you, girl, then?*'' She smiles, not the kind of smile that makes the room shine like the sun has been shoved down her throat, but just a plain, ordinary smile. It's kind of refreshing. Most girls around here have a weird temper, and a weird tendency for violence. And looks that are completely unrealistic without genetic engineering or plastic surgery. And they don't often seem all that happy.

''*So, boy, why aren't you attending this big social event, pretending to be a zombie, or pretending to fight them?*'' I sigh and put my hands on my knees. ''*Well, girl. I don't really feel... like I'm a part of anything. It's like I'm just a... an extra in a movie. A barely drawn character in the background of a comic. Without definition. It's not that I want to be in the spotlight, but it'd be nice not to feel like a background character in my own life. Being a part of that event just didn't feel, well, interesting. Not with all those inherently colourful characters who seem larger than life doing weird sword tricks and using fake guns.*'' She looks with a normal amount of melancholy out into the wide horizon.

''*Same, boy. Same. What would I be even doing there? It's like someone who has no taste for real human beings and can only enjoy overblown unrealistic power-fantasies, has populated this school with protagonists and main characters. A whole school of people who can only exist in action and drama 100% of the time, and then there are the two normies.*'' That is right. Weird really. At a normal school, we'd have friends, our own, ultimately meaningless but fun, adventures. Here, we're practically invisible outcasts. It's hard to have self-confidence when your classmates have an almost toxic level of confidence and pride. Harder still when you can never really hope to catch up.

''*Yup. Two completely average people, amidst a sea of bizarre and eccentric characters. You're right about that, girl.*'' Nothing overtly romantic happened. Nothing magical happened. ''*Boy, do you want to go do something normal. Like see a movie or something.*'' I could only nod. ''*Yeah, that could be fun. You got any specific preferences, girl?*'' She got up, looked around as the fake military began to set off the very realistic, yet ultimately not real explosives. ''*Yeah, as long as it isn't something overblown, full of action, and unrealistic. I'm game, boy.*'' 

We walked down the staircase, talking about books we've read, about games we'd both played. We weren't gamers or bookworms, but we both have a varied intake of media that isn't oversaturated with any specific theme. We walked past barricades set up to defend against the zombies, we passed the fake military who told us to get out of here, which we promptly did. And ignored practically everything except our conversation, which was about normal things. Like holidays to normal places. Our college plans. Our homework. Turns out we're actually in the same class, but we're both so unnoticeable and average that the other students have prevented us from ever really meeting. We left the school, knowing that by Monday everything would be back to normal again, with all the weirdly animalistic people, all the colourful characters, and all the unlikely events that entailed.

It felt nice, really. It's fine to be one of the background people, to fade into the obscurity, as long as you have a friend.
