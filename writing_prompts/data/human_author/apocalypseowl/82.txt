Pottsfield. Quiet town of about 10k permanent residents. Only two things keep the town from falling apart financially in this economy, the local college, and one of the largest graveyards in the country. One draws in weirdos, mysterious people, bizarre scholars, and shady characters. The other is a graveyard. And while one might not think that'd be a tourist draw, some people are interested in that kind of stuff. People researching their family history, people who think they're going to be the real life Addams Family, people who have an interest in what is quite a beautiful graveyard with wide paths, a small lake, many shady trees, and wonderful gardens. People like to spend time in there, visiting grandpa and grandma, having picnics. Real family-friendly vibe. Of course, that's by day. By night the gothic gates close to the public, and all is still and silent. Or so we'd like people to think. Because at night when the living stick to their cosy homes, and the graveyard is empty of all visitors, there is a problem. I deal with that problem as the resident night guard. I work for the city to, officially, keep drunks, teenagers, vandals, and weirdos who think they're really into ancient magic when they've just been reading that quack who stole all his stuff from Crowley's Thelemic cult. All of that nonsense was invented by bored British aristocrats back in the late Victorian age.

The task is the same for all the other night watchmen. But that's not what we actually do. What we truly do, is keep the undead from getting up and starting trouble. It's mighty fine that you've risen from the grave to avenge yourself on the fellow who killed you back in 1923, but he's probably long dead by now. They're pretty forgetful, those zombies and skeletons. They can't really perceive time that well anymore. Usually we can just show them a newspaper or a Calendar, and explain that no, Gracie is not back at the house waiting for you, she's been lying in the grave next to you for the past 40 years and she just didn't get reanimated. It's never more than a few every night, really, the problem often lies more in the fact that the graveyard is so bloody big that we have to run around all night because one of the sneakier skeletons or zombies woke up. We once had a dead guy running around for three days straight, avoiding our search. Had to tell the public that raccoons with rabies had been seen in the graveyard. Bloody embarrassing. A few of them, especially those who were buried without headstones and without names, can get somewhat violent, but their decayed flesh is no match for fresh humans, and we quickly bind them and bury them again. But mostly we just listen to them, remind them that they're dead and they need to go back to their graves. Then they remember Paradise or Nirvana or whatever, and promptly rebury themselves, though some of the older ones need our help. We're usually pretty quick about it, and can spend the rest of the night keeping a watch out for regular intruders. Drunks, college students with too much time on their hands, etc.

Of course, sometimes when its some of the fresher ones, we have to bring them up to speed. And sometimes, well, help them get rest. Find their killers sort of business. It's depressing, but what with the total incompetency of all police, we have to step in. Usually it's just finding the murder weapon, leaving an anonymous tip with a borderline competent detective, and let them bumble into it so the case can get solved. Sometimes though, we have to take the law into our own hands. Sometimes there are things done that cannot be forgiven. Things that make the blood boil of every last member of the graveyard night crew. That's when the boss takes one or two of us senior watchmen, and we drive into town. Next morning, there is a fresh grave in some isolated part of the graveyard. The gravedigger doesn't ask questions, the police couldn't figure it out if they caught us red-handed, and the city council appreciates it when we take care of those misbegotten wretches who have done unforgivable crimes. Town can't thrive if monsters in men's skin roam free.

We stand our posts at all times. We keep a good watch out for the graveyard in particular, and the community in secret. There are sometimes though. Where we just drop everything and run. When the boss calls us on the emergency phone, and tells us all to get out of there immediately, and to avoid any and all animals we see. The boss often reminds us of this. Hell, even if we see some unusual animal, we're to just run, even if we haven't been warned. Just run. Because this graveyard is very old and very large. And unlike most graveyards in this country, they are proper graveyards. Most places are just... dumping grounds for corpses. Where the receptacle of the soul is thrown aside to rot. When this town was founded centuries ago, they did the old rituals for the graveyard. The very old rituals. The sort that were originally incredibly pagan and bloody, but were adapted by the Christians. One of them was the creation of a guardian spirit for the church and the graveyard. The Churchgrim. It is a creature not usually found in the new world. You'd have to go back to Europe to find places with such creatures roaming the graveyards at night.

They protect the dead. And they're not particularly discriminating about who they're protecting the dead from when they're on patrol. Usually it was a lamb or a dog that was buried alive under the entrance to the church or some such. But the people who came here, figured they needed something stronger, being strangers in a stranger land that they were busy stealing from the natives. So they didn't just make one Churchgrim. They made three. Each is more horrible and violent than the last one. The first is the traditional lamb. In life it was probably like most sheep, woolly and not too bright. In its undeath, it has grown to the size of a wolf, its horns are long and glow with a pale unearthly light. It is the only one of the Churchgrim capable of mercy, as it is gentle towards children and the old, if any of them should ever enter the graveyard, protecting them from the others. It even somewhat respects the night watchmen, warning us to flee before it begins chasing us.

The others are brutal and far more horrible. The second is a huge and dread wolf, swollen in death to the size of a horse, it pounces and rips apart intruders with wild rage. It zealously guards its territory, and any of the watchmen that can't escape from that territory in time, can only hope that they can hide like rabbits until the sun comes up and the Churchgrim rests. The wolf howls with such a strange sound, it makes us feel like our bones are on fire. It is not as much a threat as it used to be though. Back in the 90s we had someone come over from Sweden who had done the Year-Walk and who claimed to be a master of something called Seid. Using weird stuff like a rock from a deep cave, bird-spit, salmon gills, the recorded sound of a cat's paw hitting the floor on tape, and some other stuff, she managed to bind it with a chain. Not sure how, but she said it should keep it contained closely to where it arises at night. So as long as we can get outside its territory, defined by the length of that weird chain, we can escape from it. Not as easy as it sounds. It's the fastest of the three and its very deadly.
