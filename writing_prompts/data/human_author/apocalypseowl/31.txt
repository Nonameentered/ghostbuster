And it found that it couldn't leave mankind behind. Nor could it merely test them. How could one create a test for humanity anyway? Chaotic, bizarre, wild, and beyond strange; Mankind cannot be tested. But they can be helped. Humanity isn't perfect. The Judge knows, and has seen, countless mistakes. Horrible massacres, nightmarish genocides, atrocious governments, malicious crime organisations, predatory religions, and self-serving corporations. And yet, mankind is the best species that the Judge has ever met. The only one so wholly bizarre and wild that the Judge fell in love with the concept of humanity. Now, it walks the world, and it helps people. It gives integrity and honour to the corrupt, it gives empathy to the cold hearted, relief to those who have been wounded in their souls, perspective to those who are terminally out of touch with reality, and logic to the mad. It cannot fix the underlying problems without destroying what humanity is, but it has learned human concepts that makes it possible for the Judge to help humanity, without ripping apart what being human is all about.

The rest of the galaxy has been led and bred to become a whole lot like mankind's best friend, the dog. A race of obedient, decently clever, hierarchical, and utterly devoted to their masters. Humanity is very different. They're stubborn, cunning, sneaky, and are frankly way more like cats than they'd like to admit. Mankind has to think that they're in control, and that the path they're charging headlong on, is of their own choosing. And to an extent, it is. The Judge is simply steering humanity down towards a better outcome, than the one they'd have chosen for themselves. Nudging mankind towards the place where they'll be their best selves. Because the Judge has lived with humans, the Judge loves humans, and the Judge wants what is best for them.

The rest of the universe is puzzled, the emperors and great leaders all wonder what it means, as the third rock from Sol, heals. They wonder what it means, as the Judge speaks in the dreams of humans, reminding them of decency and dignity. They wonder why the Judge wants to help humanity. They'd never do that. The Judge knows however, what humanity is capable of. When the first ship full of alien slaves is liberated, the Judge smiles. When leaders who gorge themselves on suffering, are found executed inside their own palaces, the Judge is filled with pride. When the First Fleet of the United Nations of Earth, arrives to liberate a world that is undergoing purification, the Judge sits back, on the surface of a black hole, and feels immense satisfaction.

It could have done this itself, but it doesn't want to be a god. It doesn't want to rule. It wants the many species of the universe to do better. It wants the universe to be a better place. Humanity had the potential to be the Judge's great tool for that. After living as a human for decades, it certainly understands this. It knew love, the platonic, the intimate, and the familial forms, when it spent those years in human flesh. And one day, it might return, and live as a human again. When this galaxy has been liberated, perhaps. Because it loved shedding its extra-dimensional shell, and inhabiting a human form. It loved eating with friends. It loved playing games. The Judge, watching as brave humans saves a species that was about to be purged from the universe, thinks that perhaps it has become addicted to being human. Yet, it doesn't mind. It was the happiest moments of its life. The Judge, strange, ancient, and unspeakably powerful as it is, will live from the Big Bang, to the end of all things; and yet it knows on a fundamental level that it will truly be happy again, until it once more dons human flesh, and becomes a crazy, zany, loony, and above all; loveable human.
