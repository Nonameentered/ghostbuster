This is far from the first time I've woken up in a strange place, but this just might take first place. A five-by-five-by-five meters cubical room, with practically no features at all. No windows. No doors. Only a small vent in the ceiling seems to be connected to some manner of AC, blowing fresh cold air into the room. How I managed to get in here is a troubling concept to consider. I remember practically nothing about last night, how I got here. Is this... some kind of cask of amontillado situation? My phone has no connection, no matter where I go in the small room, so it's probably underground. The walls are made from thick metal, doesn't budge when I kick them. Someone must have put me here, and then welded or rivetted the final wall tight, so I can't get out. Except, when I kicked the wall, I saw something. A small hatch by the floor. A kind of door, but unless I were to lose a lot of weight, and presumably revert to the body I had when I was five years old, I won't be able to fit through it. Still, having nothing else to do except go mad and die, I open the small metallic door.

There is what looks to be a tiny room filled with dollhouse furniture behind it. Of course, as if this couldn't get any weirder, a rat walks out into the room from what seems to be a kitchen off to the side. It waves to me politely, before lying down upon a couch meant for a toy. I close the small door, and then open it again. The interior hasn't changed at all. The rat is merely staring at me from the tiny couch, its eyes doing that weird vibration thing, called boggling, which rats only do when they're supremely content. That's... good? Looking around the tiny room, I try to see if there are any switches, buttons, weird tiny levers, anything that could presumably be used to aid in my escape.

Nothing. There is nothing. I sit down on the metallic floor, next to the small open door. Weird way to die, I suppose. Dying of thirst next to a rat with its own apartment. The rat scuttles off of its small couch and moves into a small hallway, that I cannot see much of. After an indeterminate amount of time, it returns carrying a small vial filled with a viscous purple liquid. It puts it down next to my hand and looks up at me expectantly. ''*Do you want me to drink this?*'' The rat nods, in a strangely anthropomorphic manner, that is to say that it does something that is normally very human despite being a large rodent. I pick up the vial, and remove the plug. It smells vaguely like a cocktail made from apple cider, spiced with cinnamon, and with a dash of gasoline. Either it'll do something interesting or it'll kill me faster, so I down the strange thick liquid. The taste is nearly indescribable, but generally exists in the flavour-sphere of being not great, but not bad either. The sort of thing you'd drink if you couldn't find water.

And then it starts hurting. Everywhere. That pain is incomprehensible, completely and utterly incomprehensible. Every cell in my body burns with an intense and constant feeling. It is too much, and I fall into blissful unconsciousness. When I wake again, to my shock, I've changed size. Which is not possible under the laws of thermodynamics. Matter cannot be destroyed. I cannot just be compressed as such, and remain alive. The prospect of having literally shifted size defies all manner of conceptions, and it's just freaking weird. The rat has seemingly placed me on a couch, and dressed me in some manner of clothes definitely meant for a male doll. Which makes about as much sense as anything else. I see in the distance a large mound of clothes that was previously my best pants and a decent shirt. The rat, currently fussing over itself, like rats do when they want to clean themselves, is seemingly using a small wash-basin from whence a lavender scent is emerging. Because of course it is.

''*Thanks for the threads?*'' I say as the rat notices I am awake. It walks over to me in a skittering manner, and gently starts to pull at my arm. I get off of the couch and allow the rat to lead me into what can only be described as a city of rodents. My mouth is agape as I see large hanging bridges, connecting countless small plazas, around which rats are socially interacting, engaging in commerce, and being generally social animals. Above the city continues in the same manner for such a height that I cannot see the top, and below there is a great manner of canals, upon which tiny boats, gondolas maybe, are moving about. Several of the rats are wearing clothing accessories. Human clothes would not fit a rat, nor their manner of movement. But sashes, small scarves, bags, and bandoliers are seemingly in vogue around here. I see two very fashionable rats seemingly discussing fabrics as I walk by. I see a number of small rats with small backpacks entering what can only be some manner of school. Five very elderly rats are playing some manner of card game. Frankly, I see a lot of rats doing things that normally humans would do. And I figure that maybe that vent was not actually pumping fresh air into that metal room, but was actually subjecting me to copious amounts of psychedelic gasses.

Or maybe this is just a thing that happens. Maybe I've never known that there is a secret world of rats that have weird powers. Maybe this is normal, but it is merely something I've never heard about. Unless I learn how to speak rat, I'll probably never know how this all came to be. Certainly is interesting. And better than dying of thirst or starvation inside some metal cube. The rat is eagerly leading me towards a door with a glowing neon sign above it. I cannot read it, as it is not written with any letters I've ever encountered before. Considering that most other rats don't seem terribly alarmed by a miniaturised human walking around, I guess this is not uncommon. Behind the door, there is simply a long hallway, and at the end there is an old rat reading a book. The rat that has been leading me here leaves, and I stand in front of the old, grey rat.

''*You may sit.*''

The voice is surprisingly deep. You always imagine that if rodents could speak, then they'd sound vaguely squeaky. But this guy could do audiobooks for books about manliness and it would sound incredibly appropriate. It's sort of a mix between the dulcet tone of Morgan Freeman and the gruff voice of Nick Offerman. I of course sit down on a soft pillow in front of the old rat. ''*Let me guess. You woke up in a large metal room, you have no idea what is going on, and now you're much smaller than you were previously.*'' I nod, indeed, that is correct. He sighs before putting on the world's cutest pair of glasses, followed by him pulling out some papers. ''*Well, I have no idea how you landed there either. Just seems the sort of thing that happens, randomly, at times. Large human appears, usually panics, sometimes dies. Weird really. We've tried following the vent, of course, to see if we could get it to stop, but it just leads to a shed on the surface with a generator and the AC machine itself.*'' I nod, cautiously, and wait for him to continue. ''*Now. We have no way to send you back. At all. We don't even know where you come from, or how. So don't bother asking. The potion that you've been given unfortunately has two problems associated with it, only one of which you have to deal with. The one you have to deal with is that it has weird effects on humans. In that you'll inevitably turn into a rat, like everyone here, unless given a counter which will retain your humanity. There is no such counteragent, but we can give you one that turns you into a different rodent should you so desire.*'' Oh. So weird magic BS. I get it.

''*What's the problem that isn't my concern?*'' The old rat looks at me and sighs. ''*It's really expensive to make. Some of the ingredients are imported, and there is a mark-up on them due to trade problems. Of course, you owe the state nothing, seeing as it isn't your fault that you suddenly wound up inside a magical metal room that only maybe exists.*'' Okay. So I'm going to turn into a rat. That's... bad. But it's still better than dead. The old rat puts down some papers in front of me, one in the weird script I've seen elsewhere, the other in what seems to be Elizabethan English. Readable, but really sounds like it should be used in Shakespeare. ''*Sign these documents, and we'll get you settled in a small den, get a bank account set up with some money from the government who've just bought all the stuff you can no longer use, and a free sign-up for an adult education class. You'll need to learn how to speak and how to read the language.*'' I nod, and sign my name on both papers. He offers me his paw, and I shake it. ''*Great. By-the-by, I'm Biggest Cheese, and I'm in charge of human-related affairs. I handle any trouble you might have, give answers if you've got any questions and such. And if I'm busy, speak to Chaser-Tail, the guy who brought you the potion.*'' I nod, and he gives me a key, a map with my new home located, and some spending money for food and such.

I guess this is the beginning of my new life. Weird as hell, but it'll be alright, no worries.
