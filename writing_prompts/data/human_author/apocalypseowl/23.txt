Without knowing the true reason behind something happening, how could they ever know what harm it might truly do? On Earth, a place where few precursors want to visit, and even if they have to, they don't look too closely; there is a room. It is the only room in the multiverse that the precursors can't perceive. Can't observe. Can't know about. It is the meeting room, where the leaders of humanity, and the Eldest, speak earnestly. Humanity, thieving, weird, wild, and feral, meets their caretaker there for words that cannot be consciously remembered when they leave the room. But the words lead subconsciously to actions that act towards the deal between mankind and the Eldest. The precursor who came to mankind, is the only one who can truly remember and understand what their people used to be like. The, possibly uncomfortable, truth is that they used to be a lot like humanity. Wild, feral, cunning, and completely bonkers. Now, they are boring, formal, stiff, and overtly self-important to the point where they pass through universes, putting out food for the lower lifeforms that leaves them incapable of taking care of themselves in the long run. Once the stars die, the species that were once cared for will be abandoned, because the precursors no longer finds a dying universe particularly interesting.

They need to change. The Eldest knows this, that their civilisation needs a shake-up. Yet without any threats, without any challengers, they can never change. The Eldest knows that there are levels beyond what their ancient civilisation has achieved. And thus, the Eldest is guiding humanity in a way none has ever done before. Inside that room, the Eldest is carefully steering humanity towards becoming as powerful and ascended as their own civilisation. Because it will create conflict. It will create change. And the Eldest knows that the only true way a civilisation can achieve a new level, a greater definition, is through conflict. Philosophies must be challenged. Ideas must be tested. The old ways must give in so that the new ways might be born. Humanity was a cunning, vicious animal in the dark forest. But more importantly, it was an animal that strode for something greater. It was not a pet. It is not, and can never be, tamed. It is a potential rival. Something that can, if guided correctly, measure up to the precursors. Thus, should the precursors find themselves lacking upon being challenged for first time in unimaginable aeons, shall they learn that they are no longer strong enough to hold the position that they have achieved; then it will be humanity that shall triumph. A new godhead will emerge and take the throne of the multiverse for themselves.

And humanity will go further beyond anything that the precursors has ever managed, should they be victorious.
