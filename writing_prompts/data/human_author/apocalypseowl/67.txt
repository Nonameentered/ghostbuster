I pick out her favourite flavour of cake. She is quite fond of strawberries, in cakes and just in general. Sweet flowers, honeysuckle, penstemon, asters, and daisies. Filled to the brim with pollen. Moscato D' Asti wine, fit for dessert. And lots of food, enough for a feast almost. All of her favourites in terms of meat and sides. The old lady manning the till looks at me with a smile and asks me who the lucky boy is. I smile at her, and put my finger up to my mouth in an almost comical manner. She nods, and she thinks she knows what is going on. Big surprise for the boyfriend, she thinks. But she knows nothing. I pay for the food and head out to my grandfather's old pickup. It's the only car I own, ever since inherited the family farm. I see some of the people who used to go to high school with me until we graduated a few years back. They look at me with scorn, the sort of scorn the people who peaked at 18 have towards those with a future. I hear them start gossiping like the hens they are. Chickenbrains, the lot of them.

''*Hey Ashley, who's the gifts for? Your imaginary boyfriend?*'' One of them calls out. I turn and give them a genuine smile, for on this day not even their relentless teasing can bring me down. They look upon me with rank confusion and annoyance. They still remember the shy introverted girl I was before my life changed for the better. That girl is long gone. And they hold no power over me anymore. ''*Give my best to your husbands now!*'' I say back at the three of them. Knowing well that their babes and gravid bellies are the result of men who say the sweetest lies and then leave before dawn breaks. I don't look for their reaction, I simply get into the old pickup, put my groceries on the car floor, and drive away. Out to the farm. My family's farm. Where my grandmother and grandfather raised me after mom decided she wanted to be a liberated party-girl. Haven't seen her in years now. I can barely even remember what she looks like. And I don't care to reconnect with the woman who preferred parties, my siblings, and the high life in the big city.

I drive past the church and the graveyard where my grandparents are buried. They left me the farm and a surprising amount of money after they died. Sole inheritor, even if my mother and uncles, who never came to the funeral it must be said, tried to take me to court over it. I see the priest waving at me, hoping to get me to stop and come by. I haven't attended church in years, but you've got to give him credit for the persistence. How can one attend church though, when one has seen the things I have. When I know the things I know. There is far more out there between the Earth and the stars than is dreamt by priests.

I arrive at the centre of the old farmhouse, which is quite different from most of the other farms in the area. First of all it's still inhabited, second of all its a faithful recreation of the farm my great-grandfather owned in Sweden before he emigrated to America. Very unique and beautiful, in comparison to most other decaying structures here in the partially abandoned states of the Midwest. I put most of the food into the fridge, but I begin preparing the meat immediately. She'll be hungry soon. When she wakes. As I cut the hearts and roast the kidneys, I think of the time when we first met. Grandma had just died. Grandpa wasn't managing well without her. I was a teenage girl, lonely and confused, about 15, and I needed some space. I went out to the fields, and that's when the light came down from the sky. Crashing more like. Grandpa was deaf and heard nothing, and the farm hadn't operated for ages. Most other farms had long ago been deserted out here, or been taken over by corporations and were only operated during the warm half of the year. I don't know what I was doing, I just took my hiking bag with the medkit and the flashlight, and left the farm. I followed the light to an old millpond, isolated and abandoned, and saw it. A spaceship. A proper UFO, crashed down on our land.

I figured someone might be alive in there, in need of help, so I took out the flashlight and went inside. Whatever the hell had happened in there, I couldn't tell. At first it seemed like it was abandoned, maybe derelict, but then I found something alive. I found her. Stuck under some kind of alien box. First contact with alien life. And she was beautiful. Like a big caterpillar, glowing in the dark of the alien ship. Large shiny eyes, that seemed scared of me. But I thought she looked like the most amazing thing in the world. She had some differences from Earth bugs, true, more I learned later. And she was wounded. That broke me out of the spell I was in, and I took out the medkit to at least bandage her. At first she tried to move further away from me, but then she saw I was using clean water from my kit to wash her wound, then bandage it. Thought about sterilising it with alcohol, but I decided against it, maybe her body would dissolve or something. When she realised I was helping her, she stopped fidgeting. And instead began to sing.

It was difficult to describe. The sound of her song. I saw this movie with her, a few years ago, Fifth Element. There was this blue alien woman singing in that, and it was kind of like that, only with far more vibration, more force, more elegance. Her body felt soft and warm, and she smelled vaguely good. Like how you imagine the pretty women in movies about pretty women would smell. When I'd finished bandaging her front leg, I removed the box pinning her to the floor. She didn't have any external injuries, I hoped she wasn't too damaged where I couldn't see or help. I actually had no idea what I was going to do next because I hadn't actually thought that far. But then I started to think again, as the alien girl seemed to relax and pack some stuff into what looked vaguely like futuristic saddlebags. I figured that if I left her here, in a ship that was definitely broken, the government would find her. And then dissect her because the US government is run by sadists. I'm in pretty decent shape, even if I look somewhat stocky, so I picked her up, which surprised her, before she accepted it and hugged me tightly as I carried her back to the farm.

Considering the men in black who came by a few days after that, trying to talk to my confused granddad, that was probably a good idea. They closed off the millpond for a few days and made very unpleasant comments concerning not talking about seeing them here. After they left, the ship was gone.

I kept her in my room for a few days, until I could make the barn liveable. Grandpa didn't notice anything at the time, as I had to increasingly act the nurse for him and for the alien at the same time. Eventually, he came back a bit, recovered after the death of grandma. But it only lasted until I graduated from HS. In the meanwhile, I came home every day and spent time with the alien grub woman. I learned to speak her language, and she learned to speak mine. Insofar as that was possible considering our vastly different bodies and species. She'd fled from something bad. I couldn't, and still can't, entirely understand what exactly it is, but it's a kind of sacrifice. And it's very unnecessary, done only in secret by the sect her parents belonged to. So she stole an ancient museum piece of a ship and fled to the last planet anyone would look for her. The navicomputer however failed and she crashed on Earth instead, where no-one will ever look for anyone. And I had someone I could do nerdy stuff with. Confide in. She appreciated playing our video games, even if our computers were pretty primitive compared to what she was used to. She taught me how to sing, even if I could never truly sing as she did, I've become pretty good at it over the years. Multiharmonic singing, where you have several voices in your throat singing at different vibrations and tones at the same time, is not something humans can do.
