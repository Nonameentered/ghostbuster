It could have been bearable. It really could have. Life is a comedy. And I mean that in a highly literal sense. When something goes wrong, there is a audio cue. People are bizarrely clumsy and get into situations that should kill them only to come out of them in some vaudevillian fashion that is inherently going to lead them into getting covered in some kind of sticky substance. Usually some manner of cake. And I could live with it. If only it was a good comedy. Any Mel Brooks comedy. A Monty Python movie. Airplane, Blackadder, the Cornetto trilogy, anything. But no. This is reality, and it is a poorly made Adam Sandler movie that caters to the lowest common denominator.

It is maddening. My mother's funeral as a child? A travesty that scarred me for life, but then again who wouldn't be when a bunch of dumb morons fight on top of the casket, breaking it, while the laughing record plays. There are no cute romances, it is always the same awkward, stupid, played-out, bullshit with deeply unlikable people. Every date I've gone on should have been a punchline in Seinfeld somehow. In high school I had classmates who make Sheldon Cooper from Big Bag Theory seem like a believable interpretation of what a nerd is like. Every day, every single last day, I have to interact with people who'd make a stupid joke at the worst moments to start the damn laughtrack. And it's horrifying. It's like living in a goddamn MCU movie, where they look so much down on the audience that they cannot let a serious emotional moment happen without making a stupid smartass comment. And always, always the laughing.

Oh, but you're all used to it. You all make bad jokes, and then the laughing starts. Horrible. Especially when you remember that all those laughs were recorded in the 1950s. Most, if not all of those people laughing are now long dead, their horrid echoes are like maddened hyenas cackling at me constantly. It's tame. It's boring. It's screaming for Gilbert Gottfried, may he rest in peace, to make a really obscene version of the ''Aristocrats'' joke. It's begging for someone with *any* real comedic skills to do anything. But there are none left. The great comedians are all gone. I know this, because through a horrible, painful, and embarrassing journey, I've found that every person who is genuinely funny in the world has just vanished. Only terrible comedians are left. All the jokes, are lame. So lame that they make traditional dad-jokes seem like high culture in comparison. But that's what life is. You get shot down for a date and you get the ''wah-wah-waaah'' trombone sound. You trip on something weird, and you get an obviously fake ''bwoing'' sound. Whenever something unexpected happens, at least one person will respond with a lame catchphrase, that inexplicably makes the undead peanut gallery erupt into uproarious laughter.

Of course, every lame comedy needs its straight man. The one who doesn't get the joke, the one who gets to be miserable. That's me. Or it used to be. The stupid comedy all around me makes you lot incapable of functioning effectively. If I were to stab one of you after a bad joke, your last words would probably be something like ''Ah, that's a cutting remark'' or ''Everyone's a critic'' before you'd bleed to death. Hell, even now, after I've killed the president, the Secret Service is too busy making lame puns to deal with me. And slipping on the many banana peels I've left around the White House. Or laughing at the one guy who is farting a whole lot. That never made sense to me. Why is that supposed to be funny? It's not even an attempt at humour. It is a regrettable biological function.

I can't tell if things have always been like this, because I've never gotten serious answers to my questions about the world. Only lame puns and dumb jokes. Were I to look up things in a book, someone would have in an impossible manner have replaced the actual answer with an equally stupid joke. I can't take it anymore. And frankly, I won't. So, America, I'm doing it. The biggest practical joke in the history of mankind. The greatest prank ever. And it's a funny one. Why, I suspect you lot will just **die** laughing. If not, I suggest listening to the OKEH Laughing Record(1920). That'll supply the laughs while you watch in horror as I end this farce of an existence the only way that is humane and decent. Because if this is some form of curse that we're all under, then I suspect we all want it to end. If the universe is merely built like this, and all of reality is a cheap sanitized Hollywood comedy without a shred of actual humour in it, then this is not cruelty. This is a merciful end for a tormented species in an evil universe.

Watch with reverence, my fellow humans, as the rockets launch. The launch-code was painfully childish and had been written on a post-it note. I am surprised this happened earlier by sheer accident. A sort of ''Cory in the House'' moment where ''whoops, I launched the nukes'' would definitely happen eventually. Laugh as the silly words on their sides, the ''hilarious'' puns on them, and possibly their vaguely phallic shapes, activates whatever is left of your brains that is forcing you to laugh and act like a buffoon. I can see them now, here in the Oval Office, which the security forces cannot enter because they've misplaced the spare key inside a tub of broccoli pudding that none of them want to touch. I can see the rockets entering the sky, and I can see the reports from the automated security systems, that the rest of the world is responding in kind. Humanity, reduced to this state, must die. I can hear them now, the laughter, the puns, the jokes, they grow shriller, more confused, more frightened. Was it a parasite of some sort, my fellow humans? Are we all infected, bar myself who finds life in this land to be a living hell?

If so, then it is the duty of mankind to rid the universe of such creatures. Humour was something we had in abundance. Comedy was a great thing once. From the Muppet Show to Jackie Chan, we could make people laugh. But all the laughter is forced and fake now. All the jokes are dead on arrival. All the humour is worth shit. If anything made us into these unfunny caricatures, so horribly unfunny that the Garfield Comic Strip could be considered high-brow and revolutionary in comparison, then it deserves death, and we deserve peace. And as nuclear strikes are confirmed in various locations, we shall have it. Goodbye world.

Let this be our last laugh.
