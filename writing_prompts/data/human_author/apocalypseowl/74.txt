In time, their efforts to coerce and deal with the aliens bore fruit. Greater than they could have ever dreamed of. Through diplomatic channels the various occupied nations were eventually freed. After decades of reconstruction and re-education, though far from as bad as refugees from the US had spoken of. But of course, these were the other nations with five-pointed stars on their flags. In exchange for having the formerly occupied nations(several broken up into smaller nations after the request of the locals) join the AFE, the AFE officially joined the Galactic Concord as a member-world. With all the obligations, responsibilities, taxes, and duties this entailed. That was the moment when the former US was turned over to AFE control. The region was depopulated to say the least. Too many of the people had constantly rebelled, too many had been infected by the brain signals that caused them to serve the dark bidding of the nameless empire caged in the depths of several black holes. The land was practically returning to the wilds completely. The various tribes of Native Americans had been deemed uninfected early in the occupation, and had been allowed to live free in their reservations, though now they had spread far and wide across the land as their old oppressors had gone away. Undisturbed by the invasion itself, the Amish had spread throughout the north-east, though their faith had changed in some manners quite drastically, as they were now matriarchal, had syncretised with Buddhism of all things, and had several alien members. A large number of very polite people lived long the banks of the Mississippi river in a manner that resembled a mix between the pre-Columbian Mound Culture, various West-African cultures, and medieval France. They were quite excellent chefs. In the Cascades, there were pacifistic tribes of humans who revered the aliens as gods, and in the Appalachians there were enough clans to make the Scottish jealous.

None of them remembered the old America, except for the natives who seemed to have, across countless tribes and cultures, adopted a yearly holiday in celebration of its destruction. The America that was had been buried in the annals of history. Most of the people who had been there, had been re-educated either successfully, or as the records indicated died of old age in the attempt. Or in case of the pre-invasion children, had been raised by the aliens and taken off-world to live on a planet given to them, technically the first human colony, but can we really call those colonists human, when their cultural heritage, their language, and manners, all have been taught to them by aliens. Perhaps, they are only human in the flesh. Strangest thing is, that when one reviews the data from the occupation, and compare it to the baseline for those infected with the evil that the five-pointed star symbolises, then one finds that there was a trace of the corruption. Mankind could have, and almost had, fought off the influence of the signal completely. The last insanities of America, the horrors done by reactionaries, was only the last vestiges of a failing attempt to control mankind. Had the aliens not invaded, perhaps mankind could have purified itself of that influence, and there would still be a United States of America. Land of the free, home of the brave. Where all men are born equal. A place where the huddled masses of the world, yearning to breathe free, could have a chance to begin again. That dream could have been salvaged. That promise, of a nation by the people and for the people, was not dead.

But the aliens took the chance away, when they ended the United States upon a dreadful day.
