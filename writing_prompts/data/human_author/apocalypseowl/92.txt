Tens of thousands of years worth of painful lessons, where mankind has taken down monster after monster; has understandably made an impact on the survivors. They are terrified. They have nightmares about hundreds of humans, using their even more deadly weapons to break down their homes and drag them into the light of day to die painfully. Because that has been the fate of most monsters. The only survivors are those who could both think rationally, and live without feasting upon the flesh of mankind. A small town where people never leave houses the paranoid remnants of the werecreatures. They are a far cry from their proud ancestors who merged with the beasts of the wilds to become both human and animal. They are frightened things that when transformed would turn tail and run at the mere sight of a human. They live in a constant state of fear that some stranger will move into their dilapidated and isolated small town, with a few surrounding villages. That the stranger will find out and reveal them to the world. They rightfully fear that the government will drag them to dark cells, and tear them apart bit by bloody bit to discern their abilities and how to use them for war and profit.

The last vampire in the world, for one barely survived the last hunt, lives in a country where vampires never went, where the bloodsuckers never took hold. She championed the idea of blood drives in that area, for she dare not drink from a human being ever again. She is old, and terrified that people will find out she is immortal. That they'll drag her into the sunlight and stake her there for all to see. She knows that unlike the human movies, the sunlight does not kill her kind quickly. They can survive for some time, hours even. If she uses sunscreen she can even pretend to enjoy a day at the beach. But the sunlight does kill. And she knows that it would be a pain worse than any other. She is afraid of them, and dare not even have human servants. Someone just drops off her bloodbags in a box. She hates the taste of EDTA, the anticoagulant, but she cannot even look at one of them anymore much less get it any fresher. Not without whimpering in fear.

The last Huldra and elves, creatures of the Norse lands, now live in the abandoned dwarf tunnels underneath the deserted island of Nordaustlandet, in Svalbard. They go deep beneath the surface, down to places where it is warm enough to live for the forest people. There they intend to stay forever, having sealed the entrances for good. They cannot trick humans anymore, and considering what humans did to the Selkies this might be for the best. Humanity scares the forest people, who no longer remember what the stars look like. They tell their children to behave, or a human will come to get them.

The Yokai are all asleep underneath a sacred mountain, after they begged the human priests to save them from their approaching extinction. There they will sleep until humanity no longer stands upon the islands of Japan. Then they will awake again. And the world will be inherited by them, though they will never forget their eternal fear of mankind. And in their sleep eternal, the Yokai do not dream. They only have nightmares. Nightmares about mankind and the horrors they can do when they're working together to extinguish demons, creatures, and monsters. The Tuatha de Danann sleep the same sleep though they had enough power to do the same. When the last word of Irish is spoken upon the fair shores of the Emerald Island, then the Folk of the Goddess Danu shall wake once again.

Everywhere you go, in dark caves where the light does not reach, the remaining monsters tell horror stories about mankind. About the things that mankind did to monsters of every part of the world, and what they did to each other when there were no more monsters who dared to stand proud. The nightmarish weaponry that mankind has created. Spears, swords, poisons, arrows, and axes. That was what the monsters most commonly faced. Bullets that can kill you from miles away. Explosive weapons that can eradicate you from existence in a mere flash and a bang. The dreaded light of the sun's hidden fires wielded by human hands. It burns them, but they're willing to burn everything if need be. They weaponised everything that is. And they're willing to kill not just to survive, but to drive their enemy into utter and complete extinction. Most monsters, though capable of great feats of cruelty and brutality towards humanity, would never go that far. They do not have the same instinct for and love of killing as humanity seems to have.

They never stop hunting. Not truly. It is like an automatic reaction. Mankind sees their ancient enemy. The creatures that looked like them, but was not human. And they know them to be wrong. That they shouldn't exist. That they should be slain for the safety of their kin and the glory of their tribe. Today mankind has forgotten about that instinctual hatred, that instilled determination to slaughter their ancient enemy. They call the feeling ''the uncanny valley'' and think it curious that such a feeling should ever exist. Monsters pray to whatever gods there might be. Their own barely remembered gods from the days when they were the equals of mankind in ruling over the world. And the gods of mankind, who are clearly stronger given how well mankind has done. Perhaps mankind, in their new enlightened world, would be merciful towards their defeated foes. Perhaps at least towards those who can remain obedient and subservient. And don't look too horrible. But it is far more likely, shall mankind ever rediscover the existence of monsters; then there shall be peace among men, for all wars are nothing when mankind could be routing out every last monster from their hiding holes and finally putting an end to that first and longest war in history.

The war for supremacy over the earth. The Great War of Dominion. The War Against Mankind. The final conquest of the light of human civilisation over the darkness of their past. Or for the surviving monsters, who are on the whole not bad people as monsters go, a final lesson in pain, after thousands of years of fear, anxiety, and suffering.
