I am a creature of habits and independence. I like the things that I like, and I've set up my life so I can live it the way I want. I wake up the same time, every day, wash my face and brush my teeth, followed by a balanced breakfast, and then I leave the house to go to work. I work at an accounting firm, and I'm paid well. I do my work efficiently, without complaining, and with the tacit understanding that I will be given benefits and such. Day in, and day out. On weekends I did other things, for health usually. I don't owe anything to anyone, I don't really enjoy dealing with people, and I don't have any family that I still speak to. I own 14 identical pairs of pants, shoes, shirts, and jackets that I wear every day. I eat at the same restaurant, preferably at one of the same three tables, every day. I always order the day's special. Every day. With a pitcher of water. Then I go home, and read or paint as I please. I go to bed every day, at the same time. No matter what. I don't deviate, I don't change. And I like it that way. My early life was too unstable. Too chaotic. I've had enough of unforeseen events, sudden incidents, and the constant demands of other people. Now, I live by myself, on my own terms.

That has always been enough for me. For the past 20 years, that has been enough for me.

Today though, I felt like a little change. Just a bit. A controlled different behaviour. Nothing major. Nothing ground-breaking. Just a little difference to break up the monotony. I try to do that once a year, just to keep things interesting. Rather than ordering today's special at the same restaurant, where I eaten every day for the past 20 years, I ordered something else. I requested that the kitchen made me a number 19 on the menu. A salmon side garnished with lemon, rosemary, and thyme, baked potato side-dish. Nothing revolutionary, but I had a terrible hankering for some fish today. Instead of simply taking my order, the waiter looked at me with abject horror in their face, and then went to the kitchen. When they returned, they served me with today's special, mutton with lemon garlic roasted asparagus. Not what I ordered. Confusingly there was a note attached to the mutton, partially drenched in meat juices.

It said, ''Stick to the script or you will be removed promptly''.

I am a creature of habits. I would prefer that every day is the same as the last, insofar as that is possible. Until I die. But I am also a creature of independence. I'll take orders in exchange for cash. That's a job. But outside of that, no man can rule me if I disagree with him. To be ordered to behave in a certain manner is, as a matter of course, completely and utterly unacceptable. I wave the waiter back to me, but he doesn't move towards me. Rather, he motions for certain burly gentlemen to pick me up. Bothered by this, I get up, and as one of the burly gentlemen gets close enough to me, I express my displeasure with this treatment by planting an efficient and quick punch to his jaw. An uppercut, one might conceivably call it. The second burly gentleman is distracted by this, so I use my fork to stab him in the arm before landing another punch, this time into the area of his stomach where one might find the solar plexus. The fellow who received a punch to the jaw is about to recollect himself before I make use of my right foot to break one of his shinbones.

Stepping away from the burly gentlemen I see some of the waiters approaching me with sharp knives. The sort used for steak. The first to approach me nearly gets me in my belly before I get my arms on him and thrown him down unto a table, breaking it. The second to come close to me is decked in the face with one of the expensive and quite heavy wooden chairs, knocking the fellow unconscious, or possibly killing him, as I am not an expert on the particular subject of improvised weapon usage. The cooking staff join the fray, as I throw a knife I have taken from one of the servers into the hip of the head waiter. Perhaps it is cheating, as I keep healthy during the weekends by doing certain forms of martial art, the kind that does not focus on self-defence, but rather on killing. And since I had to fight some rather tough scraps as a teenager to get out of... well, my unpleasant past, I had more experience than they did in the manner of fighting. I would quite have preferred to have simply gotten my salmon, but they had to make this unpleasantly weird.

The fight takes a good while, as I get some unpleasant cuts and scrapes, some punches on my skin that will leave quite a few bruises later. Unbecoming of a man who merely wants tomorrow to be quite similar to today. I grasp the collar of the head chef firmly and lift him into the air. He is a rather scrawny fellow, so this is not particularly difficult. ''*I believe this should make it quite clear that I will not under any circumstances be following your script. Or the script of anyone as a matter of fact. Also, I will cease my patronage of your establishment henceforth, as of today.*'' I put the chef back down, and then left the restaurant to see a number of police officers surrounding the offending establishment. Possibly some of the other guests to the location contacted law enforcement agencies in the vicinity. How bothersome.

''**This is the police! We have you surrounded! Put your hands in the air or we will shoot! You must be brought into compliance with the script!**''

Compliance with the script? And I will be unable to find a different restaurant because of them? How impolite of them. And if I surrender to them, I will be unable to be back home in time to sleep. And going to work in the morning will also be needlessly delayed. Instead of complying, I sprint forward. The policemen, always a fairly incompetent bunch, lower their guns to fire at me. But it is too late. I've already reached the officer with the megaphone. I take from his hand and use it to perform an impromptu demonstration of violence upon his skull, before grabbing the policeman's gun and firing wildly at the various cops who begin to shoot back. An unacceptable and tragic development, but I'm a creature of habits and independence. I will be home to go to bed at the same time as normal. I will get up the same time as usual tomorrow. And I will go to work as I always do. Not a single pig in uniform can force me to do otherwise. And since their wild and panicked shooting is striking their fellow cops, rather than the intended target, me, I do believe that I might be able to find a different restaurant after all. Possibly somewhere that does takeout? After all, this whole ''police wanting to force me to comply to some script'' thing might take a while.

Ducked out from my cover, I grab a wounded policeman. ''*Pardon me, but do you know of any nearby restaurant that does passable seafood?*'' The cop stares at me, his hand clutching his side where a bullet has penetrated him, possibly struck a kidney. ''*You... just had to follow... the script.*'' I roll my eyes and let go of the policeman who falls to the asphalt with a heavy thud. He probably didn't know any good restaurants anyway. Instead, I take his gun and fire at some of the cops while I use my phone to check for local restaurants. Seems like there is a decent place that does thai food nearby. Hm. I could possibly go for that. Just a few streets away. I leave the firefight behind me, which has mostly ended since the incompetent law enforcement either fled the scene or shot each other. It takes me a little while as I cannot immediately find the place, my typical route through the city not having deviated in the past 20 years. But eventually I find it. Inside a large group of people are cowering in fear. I try to get a table, but everyone seems to be afraid, of me possibly.

''*Sir, why couldn't you just have followed the script. Please, we'll all die if you don't.*'' A braver man than most says to me. ''*Pardon me, but I am not entirely sure what kind of script people are talking about. I cannot see how me not following a script I don't know is a danger to anyone.*'' The people do not answer me, but rather, I hear in the distance an approaching thud. Of something big. I exit the restaurant and see it. A big beast carrying an enormous wad of papers that ominously has the word **SCRIPT** written on it. It is destroying buildings and killing people as it walks towards me. That is also an unacceptable thing to see. Its continual existence will threaten my habits and my independence. It will have to go. It screeches horribly as it sees me. ''**YOU'VE FAILED TO ACT AS YOU WERE MEANT TO! NOW YOU WILL DIE!**'' Death is terribly inconvenient to my habits. I do believe I will pass. Besides, die? I thought this manner of expressing my dissatisfaction would just have me thrown out of the restaurant if I didn't comply and eat the mutton. Seems to be a bit of an escalation. Can't have that. This is truly unacceptable.

Not to worry though. I will be home in time to sleep at the right time for a healthy eight hours of slumber. I will be at work tomorrow. I will find a new restaurant to eat at every day for the next 40 or so years before my body ceases to function. I will not have my habits disturbed; And I will not have my actions dictated to me. I am independent and free. My will is my own.
