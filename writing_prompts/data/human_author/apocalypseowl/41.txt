''**You'll be treated by the best of the best, real medical professionals, not quacks and zealots. If you've lost a limb, I will give you a new one. I've you've lost organs, I'll put you at the front of list for a transplant. Your soul is stolen, I'll go to the hells or the heavens to get it back. You die and leave behind children, I'm taking them in and raising them as my own at the imperial court along with the crown princess. The people who've sent you here to fight me, didn't care about you. If they truly had cared, they'd have sent every hero against me at once, rather than spending you one at a time, hoping to create a legendary and true hero, as the prophecies state will come, from you. Then they'd send back any remaining hero, crown the successful hero who've slain me as ruler of some land, and then turn back the world to what it was. Serfs will be serfs. The nobility will rule. Priests will be without supervision and spread hatred to their flocks. And the world will never become a better place. It will rot. It will stagnate. It will die.**'' He looked different. He looked not like a cunning fox, not like a lupine monster, not like a horned demon. He looked genuine. Some people can fake it, but not like this. He had even turned his back to her. Knowing full well that he was giving her every chance to kill him.

''**You could end it, you know. Right here. Right now. I'm not looking at you. My blade is back there, leaning on the chalkboard. A single true strike of your sword, and I'll die. My empire might survive. My dream might survive me. All the horrors I've committed. The cities I've burned. The nations I've crushed. The arcane atrocities I've committed. It will have been worth it. For a better world. But it is still too early. I need more time to ensure that the world I leave behind will never be restored to the stasis of serfdom, the eternity of corrupt nobles stomping on the neck of the people, until the sun itself dies. Never be returned to a world where men are blind and ignorant. A world where women are nothing but second class citizens, meant to give birth and be obedient. They still have a chance to remake that horrible world where we will never see a better tomorrow.**'' She stood up. She lifted her blades high into the sky, the effect of this somewhat diminished by the comically large umbrella keeping the rain away. She walked calmly and slowly towards him, as he stared morosely out over the urban battlefield.

And she stabbed her blades into the wooden roof next to his cloven hooves. ''*I think I'd prefer ruling with you, rather than the prospect of working with the forces of the old world. The Coalition doesn't think too highly of warrior women. I think we have more compatible world-views.*'' He smiled, and turned around, his eyes gleaming. ''**Then, my dear hero, let us go down into the city and end the battle for this city. With its end, another kingdom has fallen. And a new province is created.**'' With those words, he leaped for his blade, and spreading his bat-like wings of midnight-firmament flew down to win the battle. The hero had to groan. She would have to take the stairs instead. ''*Or... I could just head for the wizards. They're keeping our... their army alive with remote healing spells and armour repairing magic. If I take them down, the Coalition's army will be forced to retreat.*'' She smiled grimly as she started walking down to the throne chamber where the wizards were working.

Time to make the world a better place, and bring a swift end to the war.
