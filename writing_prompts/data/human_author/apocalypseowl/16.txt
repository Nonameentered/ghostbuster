It is a really brilliant method of staying alive for them. Alien parasites came to Earth, offering, in exchange for being allowed to use a host-body for a two-year period, that you could rest. Sleep for a long while, long enough that any say, embarrassing or awkward situations were out of the picture. Long enough that people might have forgiven you for anything you might have done. And the parasites also did promise to use your body responsibly. To ensure its wealth, its success, its prosperity. Many people down on their luck saw this as a good option. Alcoholics, the homeless, tired refugees, exhausted salarymen, the people in society that by definition aren't doing too well. All of them were the most common users. They got rest. They got an out. They didn't have to take responsibility for their own lives. They could let some alien parasite seize full control of their body for a few years, and when they woke up, they'd be refreshed, off of addictive substances, and fairly succesful. 

And the alien parasites did exactly as they advertised. After two years of comfortable happy dreams, people woke up with good health, money in the bank, and a prosperous life. Which they could then take control over and live happily. After all, the alien parasite, being more of a symbiotic lifeform, didn't exactly want to do more than create a nice life, reproduce in the natural way that parasites do, and ensure its own survival. The parasites were refugees and outcasts themselves, and felt the need to not simply take over bodies that were already being used without proper and lawful consent. No matter how intelligent this pseudo-fungal neuro-parasite was, its basic goals were just to find a method of survival, reproduction, and success of its own kind, but in a decent, lawful manner. At least, that's what people think. 

The truth is seldom a happy one. And these seemingly benevolent parasites were simply a lot smarter than their feral kin. When someone woke up again, parasite out of their system, a happy life ready for them; they often found that they were woefully unprepared for it. Some took it in stride, and adapted in the best traditions of humanity. They built on what they had gained, unleashing talents that had never been allowed to truly develop or be used before they let themselves be infected. But others, those who had fled from their own failures, who had taken the easy way out by getting the parasites willingly; they did not do so well. Soon their new jobs were impossible for them to do, as they had no idea how to do them at all, despite the helpful information report that the parasite had prepared before leaving the body behind for good. They did not know how to behave, because despite the rest and the lack of stress, they were still the same people who had problems. They hadn't grown, hadn't adapted, hadn't learned anything to make them deal with the realities of life in the insurance business, or international stock trading, or high-class entertainment.

Which was all part of the plan, from the parasites' side of things. These people, shortly making a mess of their new lives, returned to the parasites, and desperately got infected again. Same contract. Same details. Same stipulations. And all the problems went away as they retreated back into dreamland for another two years. Every time they awoke, a few managed to get their affairs in order and live, more or less, successfully because of the parasite's work. But it was only a few repeat users, repeatedly infected, that managed to get their lives in order. Most just tried, failed, and returned for another couple of years of pleasant dreams. And that was when the deal began to change. After the fifth repeat, the parasites refused to infect the people under the old contract. They offered a different one. A longer one. Five years in dreamland. Most signed. A few saw it as a step too far and went out to fail or succeed in a human way. They came to their senses, one might say, and stayed human. But most, having already signed over ten years of their life, signed the new deal. Often without looking at the various new parts added to it. New clauses. New additions. And plenty of warnings about what can go wrong should the human in question sign, and how they're waiving a lot of rights by signing.

The parasites that managed to get that far with a human body, took human mates, made a real human life, more than merely money and health. But real lives. With real family. Living human lives, which made them quite happy, as the need hosts to be truly aware the way human beings are. And they weren't going to stop, thus, the new contract had plenty of reasons to prevent the reawakening of the original mind. One of the most commonly used clauses in the contract was that the parasite's spouse or children could block the reawakening of the original human mind, if the spouse didn't themselves have a parasite in their brain living their lives for them. Most families, not wanting to wake a stranger up who might decide to leave them bereft of a loving spouse and parent, took that option. Not that it was necessary, not really. Five years in dreamland. Five years suppressed in the subconscious mind with no chance of wakening; it does things to the human mind. Not good things. The few who awoke could no longer discern reality from fiction. They could not tell the wakening world was real anymore. They'd spent too long submerged in their own dreams, surrounded by no outside human contact, that they couldn't return to reality. Only in one singular case has anyone ever successfully returned after five years underneath the parasite's command. And even then, that person will never live a normal life again.

And so, for the most part, the human lies dormant. Fading into the background of the mind. Then into the deepest pits of the subconscious mind. After a decade, what is left of that original mind? What remains after an infinity of dreaming? Oh to be sure, scientists have determined that something remains. But as the body grows older, and the parasite never leaves it, they truly do subsume the original mind. After two decades, the removal of the parasite would leave the body in a comatose state. After three, there would be nothing left of the human that had once inhabited the body. The body will just die in that case. Shut down completely and utterly. The parasite would become, for all intents and purposes, the full legal owner of that human body. Until it, or the parasite inside of it, dies.

Of course, this is all perfectly legal. People know full-well what the ramifications are, of having one of the alien fungal-worms living inside of you. It's all legal, except for in certain religiously conservative countries and in North Korea. That some still make that choice, to give up their independence, their existence, to let some alien parasite live in their body, and be far more successful than them, that's their choice. We do believe in freedom of choice here, at least in this case. Do I have one? No, of course not. Yes, I do work for them. I understand the confusion, I get that specific question a lot. No, I'm just here to make sure, that before you sign that dotted line, down there, right underneath that paragraph about giving up your rights to any children you may or may not have during the 5 year period, that you understand fully and completely what you're giving up. Just what you're letting go, the resulting loss of personhood, the potential madness, the horror of potentially being supplanted permanently as the consciousness of your body etc. The history, or perhaps, the nature of this deal. All that stuff you're giving up on, even to escape the hardships of human life. It's a lot to lose. Of course, there is much to be gained as well. Should you wake up in five years, you'll be prosperous. Never wake up again... Well. At least it'll be painless. You'll die dreaming about wonders that otherwise never could have been. Perhaps the most gentle form of euthanasia, at least that's what the rest of the legal team calls it.

So, if you'd just sign there, above the paragraph about allowing your consciousness to die should you never wake up again, then we can take you right on down to the infection chambers. Though, given that you've been here before, I imagine you know the way. Then you can go back to your dreams. And let someone else live out theirs in your body. A win-win, some might say.
