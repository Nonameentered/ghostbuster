He shakes his head. ''*He will rule with an iron first. He has killed many of the gods, and cast their priests into hell. Just because he disagreed with them on how the afterlife should work. Cities that don't obey him will be burned down. Countless thousands will die because of his conquest. Yet that won't matter. Even if the hero kills him... The people under him will keep his memory alive and conquer the world for him.*'' I sign his death warrant. A formality to be sure. But a necessary one. Bureaucracy, it's the one thing I am not exactly thrilled with now that the emperor has taken over. Sure, it's execute the rebels by feeding them to ravenous wyverns, but first you have to fill out form after form. The old nobles just used to tell their guards to throw someone in the dungeon, then they'd get executed by morning. Easier, sure. But maybe this method prevents wrongful executions. ''*The people would rise against you, even if the side of the old order won. The time of kings and knights is over. The age of the empire, and its people is beginning.*'' I had seen enough. I gave a hand signal for some of the guards to carry him away.

''*Wait! Why did you come here, in the middle of the night, like this?*''

I turn back and smile. ''*I had to come. To look into the face of the man who beat my old man when he had finally gathered enough courage to go and secretly buy the forbidden medicine for my mother. He spent all his savings on that vial. It was the first and only time he ever tried something brave. I can't tell you how much I respect him for that. If my mother had gotten it, she would have lived. Instead you caught him, crushed the vial underneath your horse's hoof and then ordered that my father be given 10 lashes. My mother died in agony. Consider this justice for her, and for the many people you've killed in your little rebellion.*''

I left the dungeon and walked back to my room. It had been a long time coming. The emperor might have done evil things. Killed thousands with dark spells. Raised the dead to do his bidding. Slaughtered countless nobles. Conquered hundreds of noble realms. And yet, the land flourished under his dark rule. Plagues no longer troubled the land, no-one had to go hungry to bed, children learned in schools how to read, write, and do maths. Magical people aren't burned every other week. I go back to my room in the barracks. Energized, and unable to sleep, I go to my desk and begin writing an official report to be sent to the imperial high command. Soon the remnants of the Rebel Knight's forces will be defeated, Landgren will be pacified, and the majority of the imperial forces in the area will go to reinforce the emperor as he goes forward to meet the so-called Hero of Legend. There is work to be done. And there is no rest for the wicked.
