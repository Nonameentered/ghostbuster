And yet, when he saw the slaves, cleaning the temple floor, his mind became like ice. His companions around him, noticed that he had returned from his memories. He got up from the floor and walked to the temple. He asked the priests why men and women in chains were cleaning the temple floor. They explained that those were slaves. And that he should just ignore them. That was the moment the Winddrifters as an adventurous party ended. When Venturio ripped his facial coverings off, making the priests scream. They had learned about the Scarred Demon, immortal and monstrous. They had not expected that it would ever return. Venturio had not thought that the people who had emerged after the collapse of the empire would be so monstrous as to still have slaves.

But here, today, he was back. And the work needed doing. His teammates and the merchants fled in fear as Venturio unleashed his full power. They did not understand what they had been travelling with. A being who was subtly training them to become greater heroes, a being who had wanted them to become legendary. A hero or monster, depending on where you stand, who wanted them to come of age as good people, who'd lay a strong foundation for a better future. Every priest in the temple, preaching the righteousness of slavery, the divine words, saying that freedom was wrong, died in an instant. Their bones shedding flesh and then coming apart. The temple itself dissolved into ash. Thousands of years of worship, maintenance, expansion, improvements, and artistry, gone in a horrid instance. The slaves felt their magically charged chains fall apart. Their minds, dulled underneath enchantments and spells, could think free for the first time in years, decades even. And they prostrated themselves before the scarred being who had freed them. Who granted them weapons, and told them that the time of liberation had come at long last.

All thoughts of quests and adventure was gone from the enigmatic mage. All ideas of friendship with mortals had been wiped away by a nightmarish blast from a horrible past. When they liberated themselves last time, he was a young immortal, a beginner in the arts of magic. Now he had thousands of years worth of training. Back then he had been a young warrior with great promise. He had been many things since then. King, prophet, leader, merchant, adventurer, teacher, mentor, lawmaker, archmage, advisor, and travelling hero. He was back where it all began. This time the liberation would last, and none in this land will ever wear an iron collar around their neck. None shall be slave, nor shall there be masters.
