The third Churchgrim, is a bear. I have no idea how they captured a live bear and buried it alive, but it certainly was an impressive feat. Also very stupid and very dangerous. Especially considering what it had grown to become. A pale shimmering mass of gargantuan size, it can pick up a fully grown man in a single paw. And then drag him off to somewhere. We don't know what it does with the intruders it captures. We've found remnants of the other two's protective efforts. We've managed to recover a surviving night watchman who had been buried after the wolf savaged him. His walkie-talkie had sufficient battery on, and his wounds were, well, survivable. We've found what the lamb did to some bastards who were chasing a kid through the graveyard. Kid had a dumbass stoner brother who let his dumbass friends come over and they thought it would be hilarious to chase the poor kid through the closed graveyard. They didn't survive. The kid thankfully forgot the whole ordeal. But the bear. The bear is... unstoppable. If it sees you, and decides to hunt you, you're done. You can't run. You can't hide. You can't expect mercy. You can't fight it. It will get you. And drag you off to who knows where and do who knows what to you. It can smell you, hear you, and probably feel the vibrations of your feet on the ground. And it isn't contained to the graveyard. Alone of all the Churchgrim, it can roam where it wants. Some nasty business with a crew of highway workers back in the fifties, the bear walked over twenty miles in the middle of the night to get them. 39 people went missing. We're just lucky that it prefers sitting at the same spot, down by the lake, every night, looking up at the sky. It very rarely reacts to anything. But if it comes, we still run. It might not be after me or you. But if it happened to come across someone, it might just change targets. Putting distance between you and it is the only way to ensure that it doesn't decide you're a better target.

And once you become a target, that's it. You're done. It might take days. Weeks even. But it can and will hunt you down. Even if you manage to distract it with other, closer targets. It always gets what it seeks.

So, keep quiet, okay. It isn't moving in our direction right now. I know, I know, you wanted something more. A better explanation or something. For a pay that good, there's some risks involved, ok? But we can't just put the whole damn deal on the job notice, or we'd never get any hires. I was going to break it easy to you, have you deal with some of the undead who just want to be reassured or told that it's alright, their wives and children are doing, or were doing, well. Didn't expect a goddamn Code Brown in the middle of this whole thing. Usually only the lamb wakes up, maybe the wolf. The bear hasn't moved since 2009, and now it decides it's time to get an active lifestyle. Whoever has intruded upon the graveyard, intent on harming the dead, must be extra bad news, if even the bear is up.

What can we do? Buddy, this place once got swarmed by people so bad that the general public ain't even allowed to know about them. Creatures that makes the most psychotic evil bastards in history look like saints in comparison. Things that make zombies and skeletons seem downright cuddly and lovable. And those three, the Churchgrims, sent those things straight down to Hell. Whatever they're dealing with is way above our paygrade. Keep your head down, keep moving quietly towards the wall, there is a secret door leading under it just ahead of us, and if the bear starts moving in our direction, split up so at least one of us gets to live, right?

Right.
