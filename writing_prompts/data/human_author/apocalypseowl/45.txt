The planet-wide news network went live with a startling sound. Something atrocious had seemingly happened, and the priest-kings had determined that it was necessary for the serfs to hear it. Usually such things happened to work the uneducated peasant class into a fervour, in preparation for a new holy war, or a new holy fast, or a new holy purge of the heretics. The serfs dropped their agri-tools into the mud and manure and kneeled where they stood, to listen attentively. ''**Tragedy strikes once more. The HOLY WORK is once more threatened! The Sacred Star-Province of Saint Tourmallas has been captured by the most atrocious of heathens, who are even now doing their unbidden work towards defying the will of the Pantheon Ultimae Vitae! Even now they are curing those rightfully struck down by the sacred plagues! Their foul machinery and false cures defile the very souls of all who touch them! Hear ye faithful and let the flames of rage spring forth in your hearts! Work harder, towards the will of the gods! Praise be unto the high lifeforms, praise be unto their plaguing of the impure, praise be upon the Plague-Prophets!**'' The serfs, enraged, went back to their already hard work, now burning with the fires of zealotry. Many would die from the exhaustion, as their already weakened bodies with overworked immune systems couldn't take the extra strain.

Not that they would care. They gladly gave their life for priest-kings who interceded on their behalf with the gods.

Those heathens, called the Plague-Killers, the Masked Doctors, or even the Purifiers, were a new threat to the various established clergies, dictatorships, monarchies, and other space-based despotic states. Arising from a region of the galaxy previously thought to have been deserted by all manner of gods, the new enemy, the ones-dressed-in-white, had made a serious impact on galactic politics. They came in strange, sleek ships, adorned with red marks, crosses, moons, hammers, noodles, and countless others. And they defied the will of all gods. They removed the punishments sent unto the sinners, curing them of their divinely appointed suffering, while dismantling the local power structure seemingly overnight. They didn't fight properly. They took out the castles, palaces, and temple complexes where the elites ruled, and then took over. And they changed things. They forced people to bathe more than once a cycle of seasons, supposedly preposterous when it is common knowledge that the only defence against the demons of misfortune is a good strong stink. They forced their newly conquered serfs to brush their teeth daily, which surely must wear them down. And they forced everyone to go to special buildings in order to relieve themselves, rather than in the rivers, lakes, streets, etc, where most alien races does such things.

Far worse were the stories of the children. Everywhere these beak-masked god-defies go, they take children to facilities and inject them with a liquid blasphemy called a vaccine. Or take them to their pale white ships, where they'll be able to survive the death that the just lords and gods have said is their duty. Of course, this is just how the conquered aliens and those aliens still valiantly and futilely resisting the beak-masked enemy see their conquerors. Humanity has quite a different viewpoint. Superbacteria, mega-viral infections, zombie plagues of parasitic, fungal, and what seems to be some kind of nanite based disease. That was what mankind saw when they finally experienced first contact. And considering how most of those diseases are extraplanetary-biologically infectious, as in, they can infect life that hasn't evolved on the same planet as them, humanity realised that they were about to get struck with the greatest and most horrid illnesses since the Europeans brought smallpox to the Americas.

So they did something about it. Wearing highly advanced biocontainment suits, armed with medical technology that can only be described as miraculous, they came to the disease-ridden worlds of their closest alien neighbours. And found out the insane morons were just *that* stupid, that they couldn't get it into their alien brains that maybe living in the utmost filth and illness was bad. Maybe having three to five galactic pandemics ravaging known civilisation wasn't normal. Of course the borderline illiterate nobles, the power-hungry priests, and the ignorant peasants, weren't interested. So humanity, to protect itself from the truly staggering health crisis at hand, began bombing the primitive castles from orbit. Humanity couldn't quite understand how society had gone this bad, but it probably had something to do with the fact that the only advanced technology that existed on those planets legally, was the stuff used in the alien ships. Ships created by an extremely hyperfocused and very obviously genetically caste of servant-mechanics, that could be found on practically every inhabited world except Earth. It was presumed by humanity that this caste was a living relic of some precursor race, because quite clearly, the rest of the galaxy's races had a tech-base that was at best medieval.

Every planet conquered is filled with human-built medical drones, and human medical staff. Every day, new vaccines are developed by human scientists who are screaming in horror at how absolutely horrendous some of these diseases are. Something similar to a communicable Creutzfeldtâ€“Jakob disease (CJD), a bacteria that causes the body to create a build-up of chlorine trifluoride in cancerous flesh-sacs before releasing it along with more bacteria. Something which was clearly a malfunctioning bioweapon that rewrote DNA with the idea of converting the infected into a long extinct species, but had mutated and now just spread and killed. And people on countless worlds have just been living with it. For so long. Without caring. Even normal health problems were terrible on those worlds, and the ''solutions'' to them made sociologists and xenologists confused. On one world, the locals treated wounds by having a very unhygienic animal lick them. On another they cured their local variant of a flu-like disease by removing the subjects reproductive organs through flame sterilisation. None of the local remedies worked. Ever.
