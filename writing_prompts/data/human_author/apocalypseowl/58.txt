''*Wake up now Collin, get right on down here for breakfast, it'll be time for school soon!*''

I was 93 years old. I was on my deathbed. I had just eaten a fairly decent, for hospital food, meal, and had spent the day meeting my first great-grandchild. I had died. And now I'm back. Bloody. Hell. I get up, knowing well my siblings are already downstairs with mum. Dad was... is already deep in the coal mines. In about two decades or so, that evil bastard Thatcher will cause him to lose his job. But it's a steady job, for now. It's 1963 again and I'm seven years old. I get dressed quickly, and get down to the table where breakfast is ready. Beans on toast, bacon, eggs. Probably not healthy in retrospect, but it's the 1960s, the only people who know this sort of stuff are being discredited by big corporations. As I bite into the delicious yet cholesterol filled food, I note the smell of nicotine in the air, and remember that the same breed of bastards who are telling us to eat unhealthy things are hiding the truth about smoking. I remember how weak mum was, 1981, Extensive Small-Cell Lung Cancer. Nothing the doctors could do. Today she is strong and wilful, but I remember her lying there in the hospital. So weak. So frail. She never listened to anyone about stopping. And it killed her.

Filled with a tranquil fury, I eat my breakfast. I walk to school. And I do what the teacher asks of the class. I had hoped that living my life to the fullest would mean I'd get to go somewhere better. I married the girl of my dreams, I had plenty of children, a career, wrote that novel series, and did everything I could to have a good long life. I had hoped that would be enough. But I always felt it wouldn't be. Even as the teacher writes down pointless facts about the rapidly collapsing British Empire, and as my fellow boomers around me fail to listen, I begin to plan out this life. It pays to have photographic memory. Especially when you've been stuck in a vicious cycle where you die and wake up again, on the same damn morning of the same damn day. This is the seventh time I've died. I really thought it would stick this time. I can remember so many important events. So many dark deals that we only learned about later. So many abominable actions done behind closed doors. And so many lives wasted. Last time I tried to live my own best life, even as the world caved in around me. I tried to be a good man on a personal level, and was quite successful in that matter.

This time, I'll have to be more direct.

The first time I died, I just thought I'd had the most vivid and unusual dream that had changed me forever. Granted, I died early, barely 22 years old. I just lived my life all over again, and had a normal life. Only really used the knowledge I'd gained from that first death to avoid it happening again. Some good things, some bad, died a good deal earlier, but I did drink a lot more in that life. Lots of regrets. It wasn't until I died and woke up in my childhood home for the second time that I realised what was going on. I spent that life studying physics, researching esoteric subjects and unusual properties of various factors. I became quite good at it. Died in that time while I was working at CERN, something went horribly wrong. Whatever happened there, I never did figure it out. But it felt like getting turned inside out while being beaten with a frozen tuna wrapped in orange peels while you had a fever. Not particularly pleasant. And it tasted vaguely of horseradish. Also not entirely pleasant, as I detest horseradish.

After that I spent the next couple of lives trying out different things, a life in prayer, a life in hedonism, et cetera. But now, I must dedicate my life to something higher. To something far greater than myself. Not martyrdom. If I am to ever die, I must find out what can end the cycle, preferably by ending it in a world worth living in. Even in my last life, I saw how bad things were getting by the mid 21th century. It was unlikely that mankind could endure such a calamity and come out the other side alive. This life, and any that might come in the future, must be spent saving mankind, as that is the most likely manner in which I will get to rest. Or at least gain power enough to break the cycle in a different way. To prepare myself for the eventuality that I'd awake again in the same place, I had prepared myself by reading a number of very important books, some of which were not entirely legal.

By the end of the first week back in my childhood, I had already built a serviceable improvised gun, based on the Polish BÅ‚yskawica submachine gun. By the end of the first month, I had proven to myself that I was going to change the world, by gunning down the MP for Finchley, a certain Margaret Thatcher, in cold blood. Nobody suspected a kid being responsible for the assassination of a conservative MP. I wasn't stopping there. The death of one person does not equate the change of the future, so I did a lot of things. Bad things maybe. Left my family behind as soon as I could, and became something of a sinister legend in political circles. I knew when people were alone and doing dark deals. And I showed up just in time to end their scheming. John Bingham, the 9th Earl of Lucan, might have escaped from justice after murdering the nanny of his children, but I was there. In the dark when he was fleeing, waiting just out of sight. Gunning him down. Nobody would ever miss Saville, not after his crimes. Thankfully, they were never allowed to fester and corrupt Britain as they did originally. This was all I did before I even left Britain, all I could do on my own, but I realised it wasn't enough. Alone I could not affect the world to a degree that would prevent it from falling to despair, greed, and apathy. A world which no matter how well you lived as a person, would soon end. A world with no future.

Around me I gathered people who were willing to do what needed to be done, in order to make the world a better place. In Australia, a certain Mr. Murdoch was found executed in the outback. In America, several noted conservatives were killed. And often, evidence of their crimes found its way to various news agencies. Several, actually. At least one would be willing to print the damning evidence, even if it was sometimes stained with blood. And thus the world learned that the criminals were being hunted down. That an unknown group were tracking down those who stained the soul of mankind with their very existence, and ended them. That those who thought themselves above the law, would have to contend with those who believed that a reckoning is not capable of being postponed indefinitely. And a reckoning we became.

Manson and his cult tried to kill people needlessly, but we were there to rescue them. And then drive back to the Manson compound and bring an end to what could have been an ugly part of history. There never was a Jonestown, because reverend Jones never became anything. There never was a Reagan administration, because there were no Cheney or Bushes, or Reagan. This meant that someone mostly competent actually managed to prevent the HIV epidemic from growing out of hand, and stopped the CIA from transporting drugs to American cities so the CIA could fund Latin American extremists. Zhou Enlai found himself oddly kidnapped shortly before getting onboard a plane that crashed, before getting released unharmed; which ensured that a strong counterpart that could prevent Deng Xiaoping from taking total control of the CCP was allowed to survive longer, resulting in a small civil war in the 1990s that ended with the democratization of China. A small group of well-dressed tourists stopped a very short-sighted and ultimately foolish man from shooting Robert Kennedy, resulting in Nixon never getting elected. Several democratic leaders in Latin America were visited in the night by unknown operatives, and given evidence about which of their underlings or generals were working with the CIA to create a very destabilising coup. Several Soviet operatives in America and Western Europe strangely vanished without a trace. An unknown group of operatives infiltrated the Pripyat Nuclear Power Plant in 1986, and shut it down, which was fortunate as the engineers found out there was some major malfunctions in their gear. Several seemingly normal people, who in my earlier lives had been serial killers, were removed without fanfare. They did not deserve the glorification that comes with anyone knowing their crimes.
