My mum is very cool. She has an eyepatch like a real pirate, she has scars like an action hero from all those movies she likes. And she was a soldier once. She was very good at being a soldier too; she has a lot of shiny medals hanging on the wall of our home. It isn't something she talks a lot about for some reason. But it is something she gets a lot of use out of in daily life, she says. Sometimes she takes me hunting, where she manages to shoot a lot of deer, which is a bit scary, the whole loud bangs and such. One shot, one kill. She can look quite frightening when she gets into it. But it is still quite fun to be there, helping her out. She says that she isn't young anymore, like I am, so I have to help her out. Then she and I carry them all home. I carry most of it, as I've been getting a lot bigger recently. Soon I'll be even bigger than mum is. Technically I guess I am bigger, but she is still taller. Venison is delicious, much better than canned meats. Which is why today, we're supposed to be building a smoker, for the venison so it can last into the winters. I don't want to go through an entire winter again with only dried goods and canned food. So I supposed I am happy enough about that.

But sometimes it makes me wish we lived somewhere less isolated. When I read all those books mum got me, about people living in interesting places, I do feel like it would be nice to meet some face-to-face. So far it's just been me, and mum. Especially after dad died. Mum won't say how he died, but I remember being small and being carried around by two of them, living here. Now there is only her and me. I'm okay with that, but some of the books talk a lot about leaving your home and building your own place to live. But mum says I'm still too young for that.

I walk out to do my chores for the day before we build the smoker. One of them is to chop wood for the winter supply. It is easier for me to do it, because I have strong and sharp extendable claws at the end of my forelegs. Mum has to use the axe, and that's silly when I can just chop them down with a mere swing of my foreleg. **CHOP** goes the foreleg, to which I open my mandibles and exclaim; ''*Timber!*'', which is what one has to do in case anyone is nearby. The tree falls in the wide open forests of the Yukon with a thunderous sound. Using my forelimbs with the claws extended, I then meticulously strip the pine of branches, and separate it into chunks that can easily go into the tiled oven. Those I then pack into my saddlebags, hanging on my long chitinous back. Mum made them specially for me out of deer hide, because I didn't want one made for a horse, as I am not a horse. Mine are longer, and warmer, and attached to the saddle which mum can use to ride on when she's tired after we are out hunting. It's the least I can do, she used to carry me around when I was just a scuttling little kid after all.

With the lumberjacking chore done, I head back towards the cabin. I'll have to deposit these logs in the log shed, and then I've got to dig in the garden so mum can plant the year's last potatoes, and I've got to clean my room. That's all pretty normal. I wave at mum with my chitinous limbs before getting on with things. She waves back, her scarred face twisting into a warm genuine smile. She's getting older, her hair is completely white now. Used to be just grey, but now it's all white. Putting down the logs, I wonder if I will ever grow hair. How would I even look with hair? I shudder and think I'd look too horse-like. Like a mane. I'm not a horse, and that's final. Horses don't have six legs and dexterous forelimbs that can change into hand-like claws, or sharp, long, cutting claws. Enough of that. I have a garden to dig. While mum gets the seed potatoes ready, I dig holes quickly where they can be placed. She walks behind me, humming a little tune, while putting them into place. Once that is done, I cover them back up again with dirt while she scratches my head, which makes me buzz pleasantly.

''*I'll be cleaning up my room now, mum.*'' She smiles and nods as I walk into the house. My room is snug. That's the best word for it. I like it personally, with its books, its many blankets and pillows where I can lie down to relax. I make my bed, or the large area of soft things that I sleep on, look as presentable as possible. We don't ever get guests, so I am not sure why mum wants me to do that. But she prefers it that way, so I do as she wants. I then put my books back on their shelves. I'm a bit of an airhead, so I usually just put them down wherever when I'm done. While putting them back, I accidentally bump into one of the shelves, causing a stuffed fuzzy rabbit toy to fall down on my face. I gently remove the small toy bunny. I almost put it back, before I quickly give it a little hug. Big boys don't sleep with soft toys, but I still like Mr. Bonkers. I continue the clean-up and begin to organise my comics alphabetically which **AAARGH!**

MUM! Oh no, I skitter out of there as fast as my six legs will take me, and see from the window outside that mum is being held by strangers. In uniform. Soldiers. What are they doing? Not knowing what else to do I burst out of the front door where I see that there is a lot of soldiers. More than twenty. With guns. They all turn to look at me, and quickly turn their guns on me. The oldest of the soldiers, some kind of officer, screams at my mum. ''*You took that damn monster with you, are you insane?!?!?!*'' She kicks him in between his legs while the men who were holding her and trying to tie her up are distracted. That makes them open fire. It hurts. Many bullets bounce painfully off of my outer exoskeleton. I scream back at them as I knock down the soldiers closest to me. ''*Let go of my mum!*'' I charge over to her, desperately shielding her body from the soldiers firing at the cabin with my own body. And it hurts. None of their bullets penetrate my exoskeleton, but it still hurts and I can feel the microscopic fractures spread around the impacts. But it holds.

By moving this quickly, I've knocked down the officer, who is now pinned beneath my legs. He is screaming in rage and trying to reach for his gun, but I move a leg and stomp it down, destroying his pistol. My mother notices, and reaches for her own knife and takes it down to the officer, holding it to his neck. ''*Alright Colonel Falkner. You tell your men to stand down now or I'll cut your throat.*'' The officer should wash his mouth with soap after the rebuttal he gives. And I shift my face down to look at him. ''*You don't get to talk to my mum like that! Apologize!*'' The soldiers around us, noticing that their bullets aren't having much of an effect, have stopped firing, and seem shocked. The colonel, looks at me and mum with a lot of anger. ''*Sergeant Mallory Fetcher, tell that monster to get off of me right this instant.*'' My mum just presses the knife closer to his throat. ''*Alright, alright. Stand down men!*'' The soldiers don't put their guns away, but they're no longer actively aiming at me. My mum looks at me, and pets my head. ''*Elijah, let the colonel go.*'' Obediently, I move myself, so that the pinned officer can stand up.
