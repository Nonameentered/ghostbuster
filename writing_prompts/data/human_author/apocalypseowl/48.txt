Through the cold nightlands, two figures walked. Hand in hand. One is tall, impossibly gaunt, and ancient beyond measure. The other is small. So terribly small. And so very dreadfully young. Above them, the pale moon shines down upon with merciful and soft light, while the twinkling stars far behind it form infinite beauty upon a dark canvas that few, if any people, have ever truly seen. The cold sands crunch underneath the two figures as they walk together. All who see the tall one, will recognise them. Their eyes are empty sockets. Their frame is garbed in a cloth so black that all mortal darkness seems crude and off-tone. They carry a long and very simple scythe. There is no crown upon their head, there is no majesty to them, no grand jewels reflecting light. Yet all kings will one day bow down before this individual, as will all creatures in due time. Even the stars themselves will falter and fade, eventually passing across the sky of the nightlands besides this tall gaunt figure.

This is Death. Many cultures tries to call them a different name. To make them seem less frightening. But their name is **Death**. And besides them a little girl is walking.

This is not the first girl that Death has had to walk through the nightlands. Not the first child. Nor the last. ''*It is very calm here. And very dark.*'' Death nods, their skull-head moving the required fraction of an inch. ''*Not like back home, too loud there. I wish I had a light though.*'' Death moves their skull ever-so-slightly to look at the girl, holding their hand. ''**Yes.**'' They simply intone, with a calm, yet not unkind, voice. ''*What are all those lights in the sky?*'' Death looks up, knowing well what lights they are talking about. ''**The dead stars. When a star dies, they go to the Nightlands, where they will forever shine above an endless cold desert. It is their only real desire, to never cease shining. Forever bright.**'' The girl nodded as they walked on. ''*I've never seen a star before. There's so many of them.*'' Death, once more, nodded. There are many stars that have died. And countless more are going to die. When the last star dies, the Nightlands shall be lit like the day, and the desert will bloom. Death will be there, then, to watch as the fruits of reality shall ripen, once plucked, they will become new universes inspired by the best dreams and stories of the dying universe.

They passed dunes and ancient ruins, the failed dreams of civilisations that never arose. Temples to gods that had never been worshiped. Remnants of the hopes and ambitions of tribes that were destroyed and forgotten completely. Hand-in-hand they walked past shadows of what could have been. Empires that could have withstood the test of time, but was crushed in their infancy. All the while, the girl held Death's hand tight. ''*I think I can hear music?*'' Death turned and led the girl in a different direction. In the nightlands, the songs that was never made can still be heard. Dead dreams must go somewhere, after all. There upon the dark sands, stood a battered but functional jukebox. ''*This is really good, can we rest here for a bit?*'' Death nodded. They didn't have anything to do. After all, the journey through the nightlands could take centuries, or minutes, depending on the dead soul. There was no time in that place that mattered on the outside. A million years on the inside was a mere flicker of a candle in the conscious and more real parts of the universe. ''*Who is playing?*'' Death read the labels on the jukebox. ''**The Beatles. This is from their 1981 reunion album, called ''Midnight Together.'' The song is called, ''Sorrow-Sun''. Fans would have thought it was a bit melancholic in comparison with their older albums.**''

The girl sat on a small rock while listening to a song that was never made, while Death stood impassively and stared out over the dunes. When it was done, the girl got up, and grasping onto Death's cold hand, she started walking again. Behind them, the faint vibrations of a beautiful blues tune filled the night with the sound of long dead legend Robert Johnson, a Club 27 member if there ever was one. He'd never sung that song, but he had dreamt it, shortly before his death. And it would have been the best he'd ever played. Death showed no sign of any emotion. Not hard to do what your face is a skull. But as they walked quietly together, they thought about the many people, great and small, who had walked there besides them. From the greatest and most powerful, to the lowest and most meek, to the most insane. Death had rarely cared much about any of them. Mostly they were just happy to go on into the afterlife. A few were filled with horror, when they realized how much the desert had stripped them of their self-delusions. And that they weren't going anywhere nice.

Death wasn't someone who was easily influenced by emotions. Mostly, what Death has is calm mercy, silent sympathy, and a stoic kindness of sorts. That however doesn't change Death, they'll always lead their charge across the nightlands, to that final rest. But those who tried to bargain, barter, threaten, or beg for themselves alone filled Death with the closest that they could get to contempt. If you'd been good in life, you went somewhere good. Thus, those who had done nothing wrong, or just been generally decent, or just not generally bad, were happy to go when they were ready. If you hadn't been good, well, Death only led them to their final reward. What they've done in the dark will be brought to the light. And there is nothing that isn't known.

They were coming closer and closer to the end now. In the distance there shone a light. A final port of rest, where there is no pain, no suffering, only rest, happiness, and the option for fulfilment. A different, usually more baleful sort of light, awaits all those who have done naught but ill deeds in their lives. ''*What happens, after you guide me here, to the afterlife, mister?*'' The girl looked up at Death's skull, which was looking down at her. ''**That is as far as I go. I walk you into safety, and then I shall leave to guide the next soul to die, wherever they are headed. It is where I say goodbye, little child.**'' Her hand's grasp on theirs tightens ever so slightly. ''*I'm going to miss you.*'' Such a simple statement, yet it made Death itself stop for a brief moment. ''*Is something wrong?*'' She asked, slightly timidly. ''**I have guided more than 110 billion humans across the desert. I have heard polite words. I've heard impotent threats. I've been interviewed. A very ludicrous young man tried to convert me to a human faith. This is however the first time I've heard anyone say that.**'' Death started walking again. ''*Well, you've been really nice. The nicest person I've ever met.*'' She pulled at their arm for a moment, trying to get them to stop. And then let go of their hand. They then hugged Death. The skeletal psychopomp was for the first time in their life shocked. Mildly. Unsure of what to do next, Death decided to do what they'd seen humans do to each other when they hugged as a greeting in the various afterlives. Death hugged her back. After that, they quietly continued on.

''*Is that...?*'' The girl asked hesitantly. Death nodded. It would be whatever she wanted. But for most, it was a place of rest. Heroes might charge into the Elysian Fields or to the Halls of Valhalla in the distance. The pious might gleefully run towards the pearly gates. Some might see a breaking of their personal Samsara, an end to reincarnations. Others happily took the chance to be born again, to run the gambit of life. But this place, is a place of rest. There are many like it. Fiddler's Green is where old sailors go, to meet their long gone fellow men of the sea. The Mansions of Rest is another, where it is always rather quiet and there is always time for tea and a snack.

This is where unclaimed children go. If the child isn't taken by their family to a specific afterlife, the child will go here. It has no name, for that isn't important. It is a place of fun, of games, of happiness. And of rest. It might be called Neverland, though that name is tainted. Yet it is still an apt comparison. It has gates that leads everywhere, so anyone who gets to go there, can visit their kin, if they want that. Many who go here do not ever want to see their family though. The two of them walked into the bright shining lands, where there is no sorrow nor burdens. ''*If I want to, can I come back into the desert and visit you?*'' Death thought for a moment. ''**I don't see why not. Though I will be guiding other people to other places.**'' She smiled, for perhaps the first time since Death started guiding her. ''*I don't mind.*''

It is said in some cultures, that on rare occasions, when the dead souls are guided to the ever-after, the Harvester of All Life is accompanied by a small, quiet girl. No-one remembers when this started. No-one knows who she is, or why she follows Death, the embodiment of endings, through the lands of eternal night. She is clad in the same dark robes that Death is, though she carries not a scythe upon her back. Rather, she carries a small lantern. None are quite certain why, though some have taken to calling her the Apprentice. Yes, all things have an end. Even Death itself may one day die. However, there must always be a guide across the nightlands. There must be someone who guides the dead to their just rewards.

When this universe dies, its Death can die with it. And upon that day a girl might lead a tall, gaunt figure across an endless desert underneath a starry sky.
