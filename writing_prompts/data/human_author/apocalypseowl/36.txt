I ain't sorry for what I did.

I can't rightly be. Your grandma will tell you the whys of it, if she hasn't already. Hell, knowing her, she might have told you everything already. But these here are my words. My story of what happened. I want you to understand why your daddy is dead. And I want you to be angry. I want you to be dog-mad, frothing at the mouth when you're done reading. Because it ain't right that I'm dead. It ain't right that you've got to grow up without a ma and pa. But the law is the law.

And I shot a man in Kansas City, in cold blood. And for that, I have to hang.

Some men might have called you the son of a traitor, or the son of a killer. That ain't even half the truth. That's a boldfaced lie, and I don't hold with lying. The way I see it, I served rightfully on the side of the legitimate government of the United States of America in restoring order to a region under the control of traitors, rebels, and self-interested men. I can see some people being mad back in Missouri about that description. We might not have seceded, but it weren't for lack of trying. Those corrupt men sitting in their big ol' city sure wanted to, but by god did General National Lynn, may he rest in peace, save us from the heinous plot of the despicable man known as governor Claiborne F. Jackson.

I joined up early, despite the people of our county being more amenable in their ignorance to the insanity of the rebs. I wasn't motivated by high ideals at first. I was motivated by the fact that during the early fighting, back home, one of those rich rebel sons who'd become officers had shot down my own family. Your ma, my own parents, my siblings, and frankly, most of the homestead. Only me, you, and your grandma, out in her isolated cabin, was spared. I don't think you remember, but that day you had gone over to grandma's to learn about the bees. Then the rebs came, and they shot everyone. Me included. Still feel the ache in my shoulder on cold nights. I still remember that bastard ordering his men to plunder the farm before retreating. He sneered and laughed as he did so. As if it all some game to him. I'd seen him before, of course. That man was Clement Hale Jr., son of the richest man in the area.

I remember waking up in a union field hospital three days later, heavily wounded, grandma and you standing over me as the doctors told you I was going to live. I left as soon as I could. To join the army. To hunt down that bastard. And to ensure that the damn rebs weren't going to win. I went everywhere after that. I was at Gettysburg. Later I was part of the group that took part in the famous Battle Above the Clouds, where we took Lookout Mountain. I saw President Lincoln, I met General Grant, and I saw with my own eyes large parts of the nation ruined, burnt, and despoiled because a few greedy self-indulgent men wanted to keep slaves. I always thought it wasn't a Christian institution myself, to keep people who'd converted to the light of the Lord as slaves. It always felt wrong to me, and I suppose I did my part in freeing the people who'd been held in bondage.

I marched with General Sherman to the sea, and I don't feel sorry for that either. Frankly I'd rather holler insults at the dang fools who kept fighting long after the war was lost. A lot of good men on our side died, and a lot of misguided fools were sent to the Lord's side too I reckon. Felt like a dang waste to me. During those days, I thrice came close to capturing or killing Clement Hale. But he was a slippery man. A viper and no mistake. I saw him kill his own wounded just to escape faster. I stole his horse at Griswoldville, and the mare was so thankful for it, you wouldn't believe it. Shame that he killed another man and stole his horse instead. Allowed him to escape. But that mare served me as well as any beast could for the rest of the war, and I have never met so kind or trusting a horse in my life. Must have been real grateful to me for saving her from such a terrible owner. The third time, I had him dead to rights, but he was a better man with a sabre than I, so I couldn't cut him down like the beast he was. Did manage to put a shot into his arm though. Not bad when the man was speeding away through the streets of Savannah.

Didn't see him after that. And soon after the war ended. I hoped that he'd died. I stayed on with the army for a bit, sending most of my pay home, as you know. You've still got that medal of mine hanging back at grandma's cabin and all. Got pinned on my chest by Sherman's own hand, if you can believe it. I couldn't return. I know, I know, that makes me a terrible pa, and you ought to have someone strong enough to come home. But the best part of my heart and soul died on that dreadful day when your ma joined the choir invisible at the side of our Lord. I couldn't face the idea of returning home, and I hope you'll find it in your heart to forgive me. So I moved west instead. Sent all the money I earned that I didn't need back to you. Worked on herding cattle through the western frontier. Became what people round here call a cowboy, though I prefer the term used by the Mexicans. A Vaquero. I know, I know, it means the same, it just sounds better to my own ears.

I was good. And worked hard. Earned my keep and then some. But I still killed a man. And I guess you need to know why. I'd heard that a new preacher come to town, the old one having passed on. It'd been a while since I'd been to church, so I figured it was time to shine up that soul, hear the good word. When I entered the church, it felt like all the color drained out of the world. Like everything stood still except for me and that preacher. It was him. His arm was gone, and he was a good deal thinner than he was the last time I saw him. But there he was, Clement Hale. The man who killed your ma. The good book speaks of forgiveness. And we should listen to that. In the moment, I figured that maybe he'd changed. That the brush with death I'd given him had made him a better man. A man I could forgive, and who'd spend his life doing good instead of spreading misery.

Was I astonished to hear the words coming out of his mouth, I tell you what. Instead of the loving words of Christ coming from his mouth, it was the lying devil's tongue of the rebel leaders; the confederate lies and hatred spewing forth from his mouth. He took the Lord's name in vain to justify his wicked words and evil whispering. I realised that he hadn't become a better man. He was still one of the rebs, still a traitor to the United States, still the same bastard who killed your ma to take our homestead's food and tools for his traitor army's usage. He spoke of how his father had paid to get him educated in the way of the lord, all the while he spewed the message of darkness and deceit to the flock. He spoke of division, when Jesus wanted unity. He spoke of hatred, where Jesus had preached love. He spoke of war against the other, the different, the outsiders, when the Lord had accepted all who came to him in earnest.

I remembered the face of your ma, dying. I saw the death and devastation he'd wrought, and that he preached. Slowly I raised my pistol. And I fired. First round hit him square between the eyes. The rest pierced his rotten heart. This man, who I'd hunted throughout the south, was dead. I stopped his madness before it could take hold. I killed a source of poison that would have turned America against itself, and in maybe a hundred or two hundred years such men would be the cause of another civil war.

I'm going to be hanged by morning. I was judged fairly and I admitted to my guilt. What I did was murder. It was necessary. It was the right thing to do. But it was still murder, son. Yet still, I want you to be angry. I want you to be enraged. I want you to howl with fury. Because that bastard who killed your ma, isn't unique. There are hundreds of them. Never listen to them. Never. Their words are poison. Their desire is destruction. And their master is surely the devil and no mistake about it. If you see them, I want you to be a better man than me. I want you to oppose them in a legal way, if possible. I've seen to it that you'll have ample money to learn a trade, or even become an educated man. Use that final gift, from a pa who should have been better, to make the world a better place for all men, regardless of race or creed.

But do not let your gun rest easy. To murder is a sin, but to let evil triumph, is a greater sin than any other.

May we see each other again in Heaven.

Your father; Edwin Theodore Northway.

*PS; Take good care of my horse Charlotte for me. I've arranged for some fellows I trust to bring her and my things to you back in Missouri.*
