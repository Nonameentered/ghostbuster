Aboard a carriage, acting as the protectors of a large merchant caravan, there sit four people. Each of them dressed in high quality armour. Each of them have either sharp knives, good swords, or strong spells as their preferred methods of working. Together they form small team of adventurers, the Winddrifters, known as one of the more professional and high quality teams out there. If you need rogue dragons killed, orcish warlords assassinated, valuable magical cargo protected, they're your guys. Their leader is the young half-elven knight in red. Sir Albrecht of Rychlov, the heir to the margraviate of Rychlov, his blade is swift and in his hands there are strong spells. A swordmage of renown and skill. There is the quick and cunning human street-monk, Carries-The-Law-In-Blood-And-Bone, who hath a great skill with dagger and fist, who always follows the tenets and scriptures of the beneficent Mendicant Monks. A woman of great courage who always does what is best for the people. Supporting them is the kind and faithful minotaur healer-priestess Montuaca, who came from across the mountains to spread the holy word of healing, kindness, and forgiveness. The final member of this group, is the enigmatic mage Venturio Firen. His body is covered in cloth, his words are few, but his spells and power speaks eloquently enough for themselves. Together they fight as a cohesive unit that has felled enemies daemonic, draconic, elemental, and abyssal.

Today though, they're just escorting a large shipment of Cjionnic spices that have been enhanced through arcane means. It is the primary export of the spice-mages of the city-state of Cjionnes, and can fetch fortunes for any merchant who can transport it across the badlands to the Freeports of the Speartip Coast. These adventurers have repelled raiders, orc warbands, a minor lich with their undead forces, and even an attack from the rogue wild-elves. They've earned their substantial reward, once the caravan gets to the Freeport ahead of them. Albrecht has never been this far west, and is fascinated by the cultural practices. Carries-The-Law has already helped many people quietly on the side, farmers on the edge of civilisation, beggars, outcasts. Montuaca preaches with fervour and heals like a kindly mother would, to any who comes to them. It's quite an adventure. But as they pass closer and closer to the city, Venturio has grown more and more withdrawn.

The other three trusts him. He has saved their lives on multiple occasions, and he has an impressive knowledge of countless things. He has never acted like this before, and they're getting slightly worried, though all the new impressions they are experiencing are distracting them from acting upon it. Until they get close to the coast. There stands a grand and beautiful temple of the local faith. Its high towers are proud and pleasing to the eyes. The priests in their white robes are walking around the entrance, discussing theology. But while the three of them are in awe of it, Venturio is not. He stares with abject horror at the temple. Montuaca tries to shake him awake, but he does not speak. His eyes are burning with fear and terror. Carries-The-Law tries to reach out to him with her big strong hands, but she recoils as his flesh is like fire. Albrecht is calling for the caravan medics, and telling Montuaca to get her herbs, potions, and healing prayers ready. Just in case.

Venturio sees none of this.

He sees the temple's foundations. He sees the cruel priests whipping him and his people. He remembers losing family and friends to the cruelty of the gods that this structure is dedicated to. Sacrifices, bloody and horrid. They had to watch. And had to ape the words of the empire's church. Had to pretend to be grateful for being civilised by the empire and their bloody legions. Or get punished. The priests took the weakest and the sickest of the slaves and bled the stonework red with the blood of Venturio's kin. He remembers the cruelty of the empire that built this. The day they burned his hometown to the ground. The last day he saw his parents. The last day he was innocent and free. He remembers the empire's mages dragging off slaves to their dark dungeons where they committed unspeakable crimes in their horrid quest for immortality. A quest that succeeded. Venturio doesn't remember what spell or alchemy ripped his flesh apart and put it together, granting him immortality. But he remembers how it allowed him to break free. How it allowed him to rise up, free the other slaves. Slay the empire's magecorps. Raise an army of freed slaves. He remembers the others who stood by his side.

His first team.

Xon the gladiator, the greatest warrior that Venturio had ever met. He remembers how Xon spoke to the slaves, lighting the fire of freedom in them. He didn't care about victory, only about living free, and dying free on their own terms. He learned a love of freedom from Xon. Venturio remembers Qhorwin, the old bird who healed them, the black talons healing wounds caused by decades or even lifetimes of slavery. How he had such kindness, like a grandfather to all the people who had been freed. And how much that old bird hated the masters. The empire, his love and kindness did not reach them. He learned magic from and hatred from Qhorwin, and how to temper it with kindness towards those whom you love. Venturio remembers Callimar the Scout, who held the lines at the Khyden Pass, allowing most of the slaves too old, too young, or too sick, to escape from the empire.  He remembers fighting through the imperial forces, only for it to be too late for Callimar, his beautiful elven face smiling even in death, because he held the line successfully. Nothing else mattered. He learned never to give up from Callimar.

The army was defeated. The slaves died free. But it was enough, the empire collapsed shortly after their defeat, though it took nearly two centuries for Venturio to learn this. He survived of course, and met up with the old, the children, and the weak, so that he could lead them away to safety if the empire sent a punitive expedition after them. His immortality was spent trying to forget for a while. Forget the horrors. And guiding the people who escaped to a land that was fertile and free. The settlements near the far eastern ocean coast became the first Freeport, appropriately named Haven. The first free city, formed from a hundred tribes, a thousand gods, and a common history extolling the virtues of freedom, dignity, and cooperation. Lead by an immortal king, until Venturio left and let the senate elect leaders instead. It was for the better, and even today it is a city of prosperity and freedom. A beacon of hope, that the world could be that good if only people worked together. Most other cities built later are reflections of that first Haven.

Now he is back where his immortality started. That same temple he was forced to work on. He still has the scars on his back. He is a mage. An immortal mage who has powers that can challenge some gods. And as he hears the priests chatter, talking about the ''glorious days of the old empire'' and the ''righteousness of the gods'', he can taste bile in his throat. But even through the rage, he has immense self-control. Discipline. Xon wasn't the smartest man in the universe, but he taught every freed slave to control their rage. To direct it towards something useful, so innocents would not be harmed. The huge gladiator had been very firm about that. He wanted an army, not a disorganised rabble.
