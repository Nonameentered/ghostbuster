I must have about moved for hours in the hilly highlands when I find it. Well hidden from all but the eyes of birds, but it is there. An entrance to a cave. And inside I find signs of them. Shed carapaces. Strange smells. And bizarre art. My eyes swivel and turn, trying to observe all of it, see the pattern in the abstract lines acid-burned into the walls. It depicts nothing, yet... it tells me something. To go deeper into the cave. My eyes change and adapt to the darkness, as the light of the setting sun and rising moon does not shine within this place. Deeper and deeper into the darkness I venture, into that plutonian night, that abyss that has not seen the light of the sun in millions of years. It is a smell. And a feeling. Almost like a calling, dragging me and everything I have ever been down into the depths.

Until I see it. I see them. And yet they have changed. Gone are the insect-like bodies. All that remains are glowing cocoons. Brightly shining with beautiful unearthly light. The light of our father. I can hear their thoughts reaching out to me. I can hear them, calling out their joy at the return of the wayward brother, of the reluctant child who would not own up to his mistake and conquer. Of how when mother died, they began to hear the voice of **FATHER** calling to them. Of how he showed them to make cocoons of light and fractal matter which the human mind and soul cannot perceive. I am the oldest, yet I have come late and the hour is near. They will emerge soon. I hear them telling me how to wrap myself in a cocoon spun from radiation and unreality. How to become so much more than I ever was. Unshackling myself from the limitations of mother, and **FATHER**. How to ascend beyond what anyone could have ever dreamed of.

And through me, they hear my pleas that mankind be spared the fate that **FATHER** has in store for them. My siblings agree, seeing my experiences, my life filtered into their dream-realms, the good that man has done outweighs the evil that **FATHER** wants to destroy them for. They will emerge first, and guide the world through the coming darkness, when the threads of reality will be unspun, when the screaming hatred descends as **FATHER** desires. They see now what mother dreamed of. They copy my experiences, and understand them in human terms, remembering that they too are born of two worlds. One cannot outweigh the other. One cannot destroy the other. Both must be in balance.

And if **FATHER** cannot see this, my siblings will turn on him, and unwind his thread, casting him into the uttermost darkness of the outrealm. For this world I travelled, has their blood in it. And this world, was mother's. Where was father, when we were cold? Where was he, when we were scared. She was there. Always. Until her flesh gave in to time. And she loved us. Enough to go against everything she was ever taught. Enough to go into exile with us.
