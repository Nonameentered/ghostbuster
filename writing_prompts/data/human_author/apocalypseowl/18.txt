It's a political matter. It always is. One of the oldest ones in existence. She is tall, dressed in an unbelievably pale business-suit, and she is rather impatiently tapping her feet. She looks over the rather expensive club for rich shady people with an imperious glare. She didn't want to be here. But in this case, she has no choice. And neither does he. Her eyes briefly turn to her companion, sitting on the chair opposite her. She can barely refrain from commenting on his ill-fitting suit, his terrible haircut, and his unimpressive looks. People like him, and people like her; they don't often work together well. Or at all. But they need each other. Regretfully. But the political situation that they're both in, deserters from two different sides of the same civil war, being blackmailed by some unknown individual or group; it means that they'll have to work together. For now.

She smiles benevolently at a nearby waiter who finds his heart warmed, and instantly realises that the pretty lady next to the scruffy gentleman needs another drink. While watching him leave, the scruffy man in front of her puts down his knife and fork, having finished his meal quite messily. He ate, drank, and talked like a rube. And he probably thought her a snob. And was not entirely wrong. ''*Delicious. Really. I should take the missus here, if only for the food. This kind of place is a bit too swanky for my likings.*'' She shrugs, uninterested in that deserter and his little human wife. He would have been thrown out by the guards if she hadn't influenced them to ignore his petty outbursts about the size of his food, his demands to get a bigger plate, and his general uncouth behaviour. ''*Do you think that they'll be here soon?*'' she asks impatiently. The man looks around in a quite obvious manner. ''*Keep your head down man, you're already standing out like a clown at a funeral, don't attract unnecessary attention!*'' She snarls. Unfortunately, it is too late, some young person has already walked over and started babbling in his human tongue at her. She understands that he is gathering money for a worthy cause, and indeed, the preservation of some forest is worthy. She hands him a few hundred dollars with a smile that makes him even more committed to his cause.

''*I thought you were about corrupting those fellas.*'' The scruffy man says to her as the young activist, soon to be thrown out by security, walks away. She huffs and looks around. She knows why he defected from his side. Fell in love with an outsider. Someone who weren't a part of the host, or any host. He left to marry a human woman. The Heavenly Host might be forgiving of much, but not towards those who shirk their duties and interfere with mortals so directly. Especially in such a physical and intimate manner, judging from the picture of his kids that he keeps in his thin, worn, and shabby wallet. ''*Well, it's a bad habit. Like smoking, or going to church.*'' She said, not elaboration to this oafish angel about how much she liked helping the humans. Loved seeing them succeed through their own hard work and the help of others. Not exactly a trait looked upon fondly in Hell. He chuckled lightly, in a mildly annoying manner.

''*Yeah, I imagine so.*'' His annoyingly goofy face turned stone-cold, as an unknown man with a truly punchable face approached their table. ''*You armed?*'' She asked. He revealed, within a brief fraction of a second, one of the flaming swords of the Silver City. Tucked into his underwear. She could really have done without that, and he had only done that to annoy her. After all, they might both have defected, for different reasons, but thousands of years on opposite sides don't make for easy inter-angelic friends. Good to know he was armed though. She herself had two conventional pistols strapped to her hip, along with five daggers on her back, two switchblades in her boots, a kukri hidden in her long silvery hair, and a taser located underneath the flesh on her left hand. Former angels might not like using flesh-crafting too much, trying to still remain close to the **CREATOR'S** vision. She had no such compunctions. Besides, it was quite useful when she felt compelled by her addiction to save someone.

The man came over to them, his slick, greasy hair clearly needed a long soak and some better shampoo. His smile needed plastic surgery to correct how utterly creepy it looked. And someone should shoot his tailor on general principle as his clothes were so unbelievably gaudy, that no sane human being would ever create them. Generally, he came off as slimy, before he even began to speak. His manner of speech, something which can be controlled, trained, was also unpleasant. ''*Is this seat taken?*'' He asked in a manner that would generally make it clear that you shouldn't so much say ''no'' as you should immediately evacuate. The former demon and her ex-angel companion did not move or make any sound. After a few awkward seconds where the two of them didn't breathe, the gaudy man sat down by their table. 

''*So. A former angel, and an ex-demon. Well, well, well. May I say, you are quite beautiful, my lady, perhaps we might dance later?*'' She knew that Hell contained all the scum of mankind, and yet she was certain that they didn't have many cretins like this. Hopefully, or humanity really was as defective as Lucifer claimed them to be. Her reply was an icy ''*No.*'' To any man with shame, decency, or a sense of self-preservation, this would be the cue to run. Clearly, this man was either powerful, a jerk, or an idiot. Or all of the above. ''*Shame.*'' he said and continued. ''*See, I represent, as a leading member, a certain society that has a vested interest in uh... ensuring stability here on Earth.*'' The former angel looked him up and down before shaking his head in disbelief. ''*You're one of those self-proclaimed ''modern illuminati'' fellows, aren't ya?*'' His unpleasant smile confirmed the ex-angel's suspicions. Some of those societies were just small weirdos, or jokester, or people interested in weird and salacious encounters. A few were violent thugs with rituals. And fewer still, were dangerous morons with the right(*or depending on your perspective, wrong*) knowledge, dreaming of influencing Heaven and Hell.

Powerful. Rich. Usually bored. And always trouble. Bloody humans. The man did not seem to notice how tense, and annoyed, the two entities were. ''*We understand that the two of you would prefer to remain hidden here, and we respect that. It's just that we'd like you to do a little favour for us. In return for our silence.*'' She didn't like her angelic counterpart, and as far as angels can dislike things, which is hard for them, she figured he felt the same. But working together with him was another thing entirely. Unacceptable, for the first part. If anyone back in London knew she was in America, with a guy who looked like Detective Columbo, if she somehow would manage to shave him, bathe him, and probably put him in the wash; she'd die, metaphorically. Her social circle of rich philanthropes would never let this down.

''*What's the favour?*'' He asked the slimy man. She couldn't believe that he was entertaining the idea of actually working for this clown. What was he driving at? ''*Simple, really. Blood samples from the both of you, genetic material from higher beings. Its potential is, we believe, very great. The key to a panacea, or perhaps immortality. Then some directions to a few powerful artefacts. The powerful weapons, items of great healing. Something like that.*'' Both the demon and the angel stared at this goon. Their bodies was made of carbon, water, and a bunch of other basic elements. Their blood was, well, probably the universal donor, him because he was an angel, she because she got such a rush from donating. ''*Or we'll go public. Release all info on angels and demons. Your names, your addresses, the true nature of your kin.*'' What was he talking about, she thought as he looked at them with all the smugness of a particularly stupid animal that had just successfully eaten something poisonous. ''*The true nature of our kin?*'' The angel asked. She had been a bit confused about that too. Also, that wasn't much of a threat, at least to her. She was expecting full erasure of her carefully crafted human persona, a SWAT team black-bagging her, and dragging her straight to the pre-mortum autopsy room.
