''*Alright, cancel the summoning!*'' I call out to the dark priests and warlocks who stare at me confusedly. I draw forth my dark sceptre of power and wave it about menacingly. ''**NOW!**'' Scrambling, the cowardly lot of them cease chanting, disrupt the circle of power, as the demon lord stare at me with unbridled hatred and some confusion. ''*You DARE to ask me to sacrifice the captain of my imperial houseguard? The same captain who have been with me since the beginning of my campaign? Begone you foul fiend of the uttermost hells! Back to thy hellish jail! Oh jail to you! Jail for the demon lord for ten thousand years!*'' The enormous cretin screeches in the void-tongues of the netherrealms as it is sent back down to where it belongs. ''*The rest of you, get out of my sight!*'' The priests and warlocks scatter themselves, fearing my wrath.

''*Incompetent buffoons.*''

I leave the summoning chamber and walk to the balcony in my office. I stare out over the crimson citadel that is my dark capital. The beating heart of my unholy empire. Where loyal free citizens work every day to bring my vision of order and control to fruition. Where my dark legionnaires guard the streets, where my imperial schools teach the children, where my apothecaries treat the sick. Where the legions under my command crush the kingdoms of the world underneath their steel boots. Where the old laws are repealed and replaced with my iron will. Where thousands of enemies are put to the sword every single day as the borders of my empire are expanded by my loyal generals. And it all works. Loyal citizens that bow only to their emperor, loyal soldiers who are given good pensions and fresh land to settle after it has been conquered from the crowned fools of this world. Loyal arcanists and scholars who are allowed freedom to study as they please, with ample amounts of research grant money and captured enemy soldiers to experiment on.

You don't earn that loyalty by sacrificing your underlings for power. You gain it by conquering the lands of your foolish enemy, sacrificing them for power, and then drastically improve the lives and futures for the former subjects of your now dead enemies. Then you've got the power, the loyal subjects, and no legitimate challengers who surviving members of the old regime could rally around. Once you've done that, competent and capable leaders arise meritocratically through your organisation, becoming trusted lieutenants and administrators of your ever-expanding empire. I still remember when she joined me, the captain of my personal guard. I had just handed over the old ducal family of my homeland to the angered forest spirits, who detested the duke's horrid hunger for game and his constant chopping of ancient oaks. She had been young then. I was younger too, though she was much younger. Barely more than a teenager. Somehow the duke managed to get a hold of a sword and tried to rush me. I was about to obliterate him with a spell, but then this young woman just jumps in front of me, wielding an old rusted blade. She fought him valiantly until the dryads and spriggans could restrain him and drag him into the woods, never to be seen again.

I asked her why she had done that, risked her life for someone who had just conquered her homeland. She said that the duke had hunted her brothers and killed them for sport. I had given her justice, given her a freedom she'd never experienced before. I was of course still planning to conquer the world, bring it under my ironfisted rule, destroy all the old kingdoms, and lead the various monstrous races into war against the men and the elves. But she was free, for the first time in her life. And she felt that I was responsible. Naturally, I recruited her immediately. Such a demonstration of loyalty is never to be underestimated. She was with me when I led the woodpeople in open rebellion against their elven enslavers, bringing the vast forests under my domain. She was there when I slew the ultra-hierophant and disrupted the ability of the gods, both good and evil, to interfere in our world. She lost an eye defending me against the necroking and his zombie-knights. When the spirits of the lands, the spirits of the sea, and the spirits of civilisation sat the crown of ages upon my head, she was part of the honour-guard.

When my former captain retired, due to old age, she was elected by her peers as the best suitable replacement. And she has done an admirable job, both by my estimates and by the estimates of her predecessor. To sacrifice her for power would make her loyalty hollow. I would not deserve it. And who would truly be loyal to me afterwards? Who would truly be loyal if I freely killed my subordinates for mere power? I had planned to offer entire royal bloodlines to the demon. Captured and kept alive in my dungeons, for just this occasion, if it could give me the power to destroy the so-called Hero of Legend, who some old traditionalist wizard dug up from some ancient tomb or other world. Or some such nonsense. And it asks me to sacrifice someone who has been loyal to me? Demons, even the great demon lord it seems, are truly and utterly moronic.

''*My liege.*'' I turn around to see her. Iron-grey hair, her black-steel armour shining in the red light of the evening sun. My captain. She is kneeling, which is a tendency some of my underlings seem to have. ''*Arise, captain. You are not young anymore, I can imagine that being painful for your knees.*'' She does as I bid. I pour out a measure of wine into a glass, formed ornamentally to look like it has dragon features, which does not seem to improve or worsen the flavour. I hand her one, and she accepts hesitantly. ''*Well, I suppose I should have seen this coming. My captain, if I ever have the idea to consider demonic intervention again, remind me of this.*'' She stands there, stiffly, with the glass in her hand. I take a small sip of wine as I admire the gothic architecture of my citadel of evil.

''*My liege. If you had asked it of me, I would have done it.*'' I spit out the wine in surprise. ''*â€¦What? I'm sorry, captain, what?*''

She looks at me with fire and determination. She looks fierce and strong. Like she did when she raised her sword to duel that duke, when we first met. ''*If you had asked it of me, my liege, I would have gladly given myself to that demon.*'' So I wasn't hearing things. Good. I stare at her for a bit. ''*Not that I don't appreciate the sentiment, but you are aware of what the demon lord does, right?*'' She nods. That's loyalty. Right there. Loyalty as strong and true as pure steel. ''*Captain Arianne of Highwater. I appreciate that you have such loyalty to me. It shows commendable belief in my cause, conquering the world, that you would do this for me.*'' My hands shake momentarily. She would have done it. Loyalty in such amounts, a marvel in this age when the Allied Kingdoms are willing to send for legendary heroes to defeat me. ''*Thank you. But I would never cross that line. Never. The royalty of old would gladly have given their firstborn for power. The kings against which I fight, those who are on the side of tradition, honour, and the faith, and they are incompetent, inbred fools who fought like rabid dogs over scraps of patrimony. To sacrifice a loyal underling is their way.*''

She hesitates for a moment, before answering. ''*But, pardon me for asking my liege, how else are you going to defeat the legendary hero? The prophecy clearly states that you shall die by his hand.*'' I nod. I've been trying to subvert that damn prophecy for years. Instead of answering directly, I motion for her to join me on the balcony. She marches to my side like we were still on the battlefield. If one were to look directly ahead one sees only the capital, its many spires, the dirigible landing towers, the arcanist academies where modern thaumaturgy is being studied. The great port where ships from countless continents dock and leave carrying raw materials to the capital and exporting finished goods and new knowledge to long established lands and newly conquered provinces. But if one looks straight down, where I am pointing, one sees a garden with many waterpools, high trees with ample shade. There one can see the wives of my generals keeping a close watch on their children. There one can see the orphans I have taken in, the children of those loyal to me who have fallen in battle, and are now raised in luxury, with access to ample opportunities for education.
