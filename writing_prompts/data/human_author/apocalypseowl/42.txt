Atop the roof of the castle, overlooking the overrun city down below, they fought. Blade and spellblasts traded equally between the two of them. No matter what they did, no matter what secret last moment power they used, they were evenly matched. The tall and darkly clad villain stood proudly, blood and rain mixing upon his aquiline face, smiling with an almost manic joy at finally facing his foe in battle. Before him stood the hero, her blades crackling with magical lightning and shining with the glow of arcane fire. Lowering his longsword, the villain straightened his back, and began to speak. ''**Join me, and together we can topple the thrones of this world and rule!**'' The hero stiffened, and seemed to lose her concentration for a moment before answering. ''*Alright. What's your healthcare plans? Your administrative policies. I figure I should at least give you a chance to argue for them.*''

The villain rubbed his chin for a moment, as it ached something fierce after the hero had managed to get a good kick at his face earlier in the fight. ''**Do you mean on a personal level, as in what care does my allies and close partners get? Or do you mean in general for the society I am planning to build?**'' The hero shrugged and looked out over the city where the royal guard and the armies of darkness were brutally murdering each other. ''*I mean, both I guess, but considering those guys down there, then I guess the societal healthcare plan is more important to know about.*'' Out of nowhere, the villain pulled a tome, a table, the largest umbrella that the hero had ever seen, and some nice chairs. He motioned for her to sit down as he also conjured a chalkboard out of thin air, and placed it beneath the umbrella. An umbrella that was large enough to shield most of the partially ruined castle where the two of them had been fighting from the rain. 

''**My plans for a healthcare system includes the nationalisation of previously for-profit or extremely religious hospitals, followed by an empire wide registration of citizens, who'll gain access to a universalist system of healthcare through their unique individual magical registration number. This will ensure that all citizens of my dark empire will gain access to equal levels of medical treatment regardless of species, sex, wealth, or faith. Medical academies will be set up as well in order to increase the number of nurses, doctors, orderlies, midwives, and other healthcare professionals. This is an absolute necessity as I plan to increase the number of hospitals to ensure that maximum possible coverage is achieved through every province of my evil empire. This will coincide with my plans to ensure mandatory maternity or paternity work-leave for a minimum of 40 weeks for all. Furthermore I will in the future have special ''super-hospitals'' built in the largest cities where thaumaturgical and medical specialists who can treat more obscure illnesses, curses, sudden mutations, etc. will be centralized under one roof. Those places will also be the developmental centres for my vaccination campaigns. We'll have spell-pestia, miasmic carcinomic growths, and smallpox eradicated by the end of the century at the current rates of vaccination in my realm of utmost evil. This will all be paid for with the ludicrous amounts of wealth kept in vaults and used on leisure by the nobility is ceased for the common good, combined with a progressive tax law that will ensure that while people can become rich in my dark empire, they cannot gain riches that will allow them to subvert imperial law. This will of course benefit the poorest in society who'll be able to afford better food, thus becoming more healthy, and possibly afford higher education which will assist them in rising higher in society than they'd ever thought possible. Of course, while I am on the subject, as it does lead to better health in the long run; basic education from the ages of 6 to 18 will be free as part of my school system reforms. Which is to say that I am actually going to create a school system, because whatever these lands have got going right now definitely didn't count. Do you know I snuck inside the city by tricking a guard to believe that I wasn't actually the dark emperor, but just his nice cousin who looks exactly like him. Wouldn't happen if people got an education.**''

The villain stopped when he noticed that the hero had raised her hand. He had been drawing helpful diagrams and notes on the chalkboard while explaining this. ''**Yes, you have a question?**'' The hero got off her surprisingly comfortable chair and took a very dramatic look out over the city where thousands of people where currently engaged in a fight to the death, which hadn't stopped while the explanation was going on. ''*Uh, yeah, most of that sounds pretty good. Aren't you supposed to be the villain.*'' The villain gave her a warm, but still remarkably vulpine smile. The sort that the foxes probably reserves for a bunny that was cunning enough to get away. ''**I mean, I am going to slaughter thousands, destroy temples, end the current social order, eradicate the entire social class known as the nobility through violent means, burn cities, and eventually if possible murder at least one pantheon of gods who I just plain don't like. I also enforce blood donations to feed the vampire clans to ensure that they'll be loyal to me. And I've turned a lot of my enemies into woodland critters; turned out the forest where I used to place them afterwards was full of werewolves. On the plus side I've got a tribe of very loyal werewolves working for me now.**''

The hero slowly nodded. And then sat down again. ''*Uh-huh. Besides the whole evil conquest thing, and that whole accidentally feeding your enemies to a bunch of werewolves, that doesn't seem on the whole to be all that evil. What else do you do in your dark empire?*'' So the villain began to explain the education system, the schooling and feeding of children who'd before never have the chance to be anything other than serfs or plague victims. He told her about the well-funded orphanages, about the money for artistic endeavours in the major cities, about new academies for theatrics and the musical arts. He told her about all the benefits he was bringing to his subjects. About the rights they now had. About the roads that were safe to travel. He told her of the pension plans, of magical retirement homes.

''**Of course, this is all talk, you cannot actually know that I am truly good or truly wicked. If I speak the truth about what I do. You have only walked in the unconquered lands of my many enemies. Where the old world holds sway.**'' She nodded. He made a fair point. He could be lying. On the other hand, he'd really thought this through. And he'd thrown away his sword. If she wanted to, right now, she could leap at him, blades in her hands. She could cut his head off right now, end the empire. And yet. She didn't. She was a hero. She'd come from another world as one of hundreds of heroes summoned by the losing side. One of hundreds that had risen to the occasion as heroes, where before they'd only been gamers, clerks, temps, or students. One of the many who'd fought against the dark lord, the emperor of evil. All before her had died fighting. And yet, she didn't try to kill him. ''*What about personal healthcare. If I decide to work for you, and I get wounded? Or worse?* He smiled and turned the chalkboard over to begin another, hopefully shorter explanation.
