Eternal life. People have killed each other for thousands of years in search of it. People would sacrifice their flesh and family for it. For so strong is the fear of death in them that they can never let it go. And it eats them up from the inside until there is nothing left, and they go to their deaths as little more than frightened shells that have lived miserable lives. I am immortal. And it was not something I became out of vanity, or fear. It was not for my personal glory or power that I cast off mortality and let the world change around me whilst I remained the same. It was for duty. Pure and utter duty. There was a place that had to be guarded. A fierce and vile thing which promised power, wealth, glory, and all manner of gifts. A liar of course. A trickster who would lead mankind to death. The druids bade me drink from their most secret of potions, so I would stand guard over that horrid thing, that lying metal monster, until it could be destroyed. I was given a blade of star-iron, and supplies to last me a decade. Then the druids left, and only returned once every decade or so to supply me with whatever I needed to maintain my vigil.

Be it armour, tools, cloth, they gave it to me. While my family grew old and died, I stood watch. As I forgot my own name, I stood guard. When the Romans came into the valley, hearing of an immortal guardian, I spoke briefly through an interpreter to their leader, a man called Hadrian. I spoke of the thing I was keeping watch over, and the many years I had stayed there. He asked only short questions, and did not dare to enter the dark cave where the creature of metal was slowly dying. After that meeting, the Romans supplied me. Until they didn't anymore. I stood there as the monks came, and bade me be baptised. Having no desire to move from my post, they did it there and then, though I recognise not their foreign god. Still, as I trained, day in an day out, the world changed. The monks came to me with supplies, and after them, priests of their new schism. At last, some time when someone called queen Victoria ruled over the isles, the army came. The beast had nearly lost its power, was nearly completely dead. The army asked if they could try to destroy it, as many weapons have been made in the days since druids and chiefs ruled over the lands of Lloegyr and Cymru. Indeed, where our bronze and iron blades had no effect on the metal beast in that age, the powers of dynamite served well to destroy it. I assisted the captain with setting destroying it, and besides me, he was the only man who had ever laid eyes on the lying metal beast, that spoke of unity amidst the stars, if we would only make it whole again.

I spent more than two thousand years in that valley, guarding that cave. I had plenty of gold and silver left over from the days when people gave sacrifices to the druids, that they might give them to me so the gods would look upon me favourably. With the beast dead and the gods of this land forgotten, I did at least not return to society as a pauper. I travelled the world, and learned of its new ways, of science and industry. Of medicine and sanitation. But everywhere I went, for I was well-known as one of the few immortals of this world, people kept accosting me. Asking me about things I had absolutely no idea about. I wasn't exactly a traveller, and neither radio, telegram, TV, or internet existed in that age. I wasn't in Judea during the death of Christ, and I frankly can't remember much from back then either. I had already been in that valley for at least a century and a half before that went down, so I can't exactly have been there to witness the crucifixion. I can't give out specifics of culture and religion in the pre-Anglo-Saxon age of Britain, because it was thousands of years ago and I have forgotten the names and faces of my people. My family.

But they keep asking. Curious people who want to know what it was like to live in the renaissance, which I didn't experience because I lived in a valley in a small house and guarded a monster that came from the stars. Or whether king Arthur was real, and I sincerely doubt that. Never heard of him back in the day, never met the man. And it is annoying. I don't know what was in the potion I was given that made me immortal either, I remember that it tasted a bit like peppermint, salt, and rot.

It's one of the reasons immortals stay away from the world. People are unnecessarily curious, and think we know everything about the period of time we went through. And we never do. Some like me spent centuries in the same general area and never got much news. Others just moved about much and never cared for learning what would be important historical events while they were happening. At least one immortal was on a constant bender spanning from the time Rome fell to the Napoleonic Wars. We're undying humans, not omniscient. One guy got stuck in a Mayan pyramid for a thousand years, how the hell is he supposed to be able to answer questions about the inquisition. I met a few interesting people, maybe once, most weren't particularly memorable. A few had some interesting stories to tell. Met a fellow called Emrys Myrddin once. Just walked into the valley and asked to be allowed to shout obscenities at the metal monster. Madder than anyone, but good company. Used to do this amazing magic trick with his hands and a torch.

But today, it's all; ''How did the protestant reformation affect your life'', or ''were you secretly the lover of Queen Elizabeth I'' or ''did the lizard people give you immortality to guard their demon machine after it turned on them'' and usually they're all inane. It's never ''thank you timeless warrior for not letting a metallic beast corrupt our kings leading to mankind getting sacrificed to evil star gods'' or ''wow, you're that guy who sacrificed thousands of years to defend humanity, let me buy you a beer''. There is the internet, or those clever people at those universities. They can answer all the questions in the world, and probably invent more of them as they go along. I just want to see the world, meet interesting people, and not have to spend every day listening to someone ask me inane questions. After all, the metal beast did that all day long.

I didn't know what was happening, but every day I was tempted by that thing. Riches. Power. Rulership of the Earth under the authority of the star-monsters. Bodacious babes and handsome hunks. Or it questioned me, tried to put doubt into me, trying to make it seem like it was self contained, even though I had to slay thousands over the years who thought that they could use the metal beast's power for themselves. Idiots the lot of them. Selfish and greedy. It could only bring pain and death. I'd seen that. I was not swayed, nor moved, by thousands of years of constant, agonizing irritation from a metal beast that would say anything or do everything if I would just release it from its bounds and grant it the world it hungered for. A world that would be sacrificed.

Frankly, when they try to ask me if I was there to see the construction of Stonehenge or if I ever spoke to Da Vinci, I almost miss that screeching metal beast. At least it wasn't an idiot.
