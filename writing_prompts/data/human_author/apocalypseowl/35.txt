Jewel-encrusted ceremonial jade bowl, early 3rd Dynasty of the Elven city-state of Na-Treminoiel, pictographs depicting the victory of the Elven Rangers over an invading force of goblins can be found on the side. Fair condition. Collection of various coins from the Harrowing Age, Dwarven make, ranging from bronze to platinum in metals, depicts the royal signet of King Ha'Rumman Tethys on both sides. Wine aged in oaken barrels, placed in glass bottles; Not drinkable as lead has been used as the sweetener, but still has monetary value as humans don't know that lead is dangerous yet. Ok. That's about it. I note down into my stone tablets that the count of my hoard has been completed after the recent disturbance. Always a bother really. Some human knight comes and tries to challenge me, kill me secretly, or just steal my treasures. I'd worry a lot more if I couldn't smell them from five miles away. It's not that humans smell bad conceptually, but they bathe maybe once a year. Yuck. And the quality has really fallen in recent time.

The last one was perhaps a little clever, covering himself in dirt, sheep's wool, and rubbing himself over a few sheep. But he should have realised that few sheep willingly go close to a dragon's lair. Except my cousin Erthyerigard, she hoards the best sheep in the realm, and they're quite comfortable around her. Had to go and check it out when I smelled sheep in my cave. Turns out it was a dirty, unkempt human. And he got dirt and human muck all over my treasures. At least the bastard didn't touch the aged cheese. I'd have to pay the dwarves for damaged goods if he did. It's an excellent way to earn money. Let some cheese age in a closed-off part of your lair for a few years, and get paid for it. And money is an excellent way to get books, wines, cheeses for private use, smoked ham, soft silk pillows with real goose-down for one's nest, and other fine things. A dragon doesn't live on raw meat and roots dug up from the ground after all. Well, I suppose I could, but that would be absolutely horrid.

I figured it's because of that princess. I told her it was a bad idea to have me pick her up from her tower and let her run off with that cute witch. Told her it was a better idea that I just distract the king and all of his knights while the witch flies up to the castle on the broomstick, allowing them to fly away. But no, she had to pay me extra for the big ol' service. Had to get the whole ''kidnapped by a dragon, oh cruel fate'' thing going. Of course I couldn't say no to real sapphires on a tiara made from electrum. And I just couldn't say no to her in any case, I mean, she and the witch makes a great couple. They've got a cottage over on the next mountain where they are living together, cursing people, turning dukes, counts, and princes into various woodland critters. I know I can't go out for a snack these days without asking the animal I've caught if it used to be a noble. Though they're usually rare animals that the witch and the princess have noted are threatened due to the hunting traditions of the nobility. Besides that, they're real good neighbours.

Of course, with the king sending out his knights after me, it isn't all fun. While I am reading the latest Dwarven Noir novel ''The Glodglodssonsson Conspiracy'' by Trisu of clan Ironmace, I can smell a smell. Like the distant smell of an animal only worse. It is quite clearly a human being, that I can of course make out. Putting down my reading, I head out towards the cave entrance. And I can hear him now. ''*Dragon! You are... evil and... bad and... bad and... evil...!*'' Wow. The noble brotherhood of knights has really gone downhill. I dread the boredom and possibly the terrible smell of this encounter. I mean, is it too much to ask that humans use animal fat and ash to make a primitive form of soap, and bathe more than once a year? Honestly, the latest knights sent after me were barely more than scoundrels and thugs, but sending a squeaky voiced... small... knight. A child. That's not a grown man. By my sire and dam, that is a human child in armour far too big for it. Is the king serious? Then again he was a drunken besotted fool who couldn't seem to keep his advisors from arranging the accidental deaths of all of his sons and planning the marriage of his only daughter to one of their cronies in the neighbouring kingdom. He might have killed his advisors in a fit of drunken rage, or maybe he doesn't care as much about his escaped daughter anymore. Rather than merely incinerating the squeaky little human thing, I move faster than the scared thing can comprehend, removing its blade and armour without harming the poor little guy.

To his credit, he doesn't seem to be fainting. He is without armour and only in his clothes, without a weapon, and still he stands defiant. Is he too dense to frighten? Using the inherent magic that exists within every dragon, I probe his mind. It is in fact not stupid. Merely incredibly ill-used. This human could be quite clever, if trained and taught. The son of a lesser noble, sent out on a token quest, yes, I read his memory so easily that I read details that he couldn't even begin to fathom with his current lack of any form of education or training. The king was dying from poison before the boy even left. The advisors are done waiting, and done trying. The king dies, one of the nobles takes over, one who has an agreement with the corrupt advisors. Royalty does not truly come from blood. That's just a story people tell. Royalty comes from command, from inner strength, from determined will and purity of intent. And he was willing to fight a dragon to save someone. Brave, kind, untaught but that can be fixed, and even a little ambitious. Those who save princesses usually wind up marrying them, though this one would rather remain unmarried. Perhaps, it is time to do a little charity.

The human, just a brave lad, tries to charge at me with his fists. It's... cute. And ineffectual. I let the little human tire himself out, after which I take him inside. I clean the human, which takes a lot longer than I'd imagine. But well worth it when he no longer smells like solidified milk. Then I dress him in fine clothes, that I have previously scavenged from the various nobles turned into critters that seem to be so common around here. And as his energy return, as he wants to begin fighting, I begin sending signals into his little weak and untrained mind. It is only something one can do with animals and humans who have never had much time to think, or have been forced to cease to think by others. Those around the boy have always looked down on cleverness and thinking. Brute force was always enough, and in emulating his brethren and father, his mind is not as great as it could have been. But it'll do. The signals make him calm. Make him able to listen. He was sent here to die, but instead he shall receive the greatest gifts in the universe. An education, and a destiny. Dragons can do that, we can mark people with appropriate destinies. Burn a future into their souls. And since the leadership of the kingdom is going to hell fairly soon, I think I should change this brave little boy who dared to stand up to a dragon, and tried to fight one with his bare hands; into a king.

As magic flows into him, through me, he changes a little. His path becomes clearer. His mind is freed from the foolish notions of those who have sent him to die. His eyes open in a very wide fashion. I think I shall... wait can dragons even legally adopt non-orphans? Well, he has seemingly always had potential and he has a future now, so I'm keeping him. ''**Well then, my little student, do you still seek my death?**'' He remembers it, but now he can once more think critically. ''*No... You are a dragon. You are big and strong and can spray fire upon a hunnerd knights. I can't see how I was supposed to kill you and rescue the princess. I don't think anyone in the whole kingdom could kill you on their lonesome.*'' I smile, revealing a long set of deadly sharp teeth. ''**Well, my little student, the princess is not here, she is currently living happily on her own with a dear friend. And it's hundred, not hunnerd.**'' He nods, gravely. ''**I see that there is much you will need to learn to become a true knight. Now however, you must be hungry after the long trek up the mountain, let me take you to the kitchen. I think you'll enjoy my take on a venison burger.**'' Once more, he nods, and allows me to pick him up as I carry him further into my lair and down to the kitchen. I saw it clearly in his memory, that since his own father disregards him as weak and frail, and how he was sent to die, he will have no loyalties to his old life. Not now that I've torn down the barriers in his mind that humans create to protect themselves from the painful truth. He will learn. He will live. And he will one day probably save his kingdom from corruption and ruin. Quite frankly, this is probably easier to deal with, than waiting for the stinky stupid humans down in the valleys to stop mucking their kingdom up.

Besides, if I can teach him proper cleanliness, and better manners, then once he rules the kingdom, maybe I can get more visitors who don't try to rob me or smell like they've taken a bath in the local cesspool. Would be an excellent change of pace.
