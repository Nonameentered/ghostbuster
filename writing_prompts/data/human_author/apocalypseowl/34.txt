It helped that they looked cute. Sort of like a hybrid between red pandas, raccoons, and otters.

It was a tempting offer still, but it helped that they had that natural cuteness. At first we thought that we were getting invaded. That the moment had come, that all those B-movies had prepared us for. Here comes the alien fleet, hovering above the Earth, sending down messages in an unknown language. Scared a lot of people, all those unknown weapons potentially aimed right at us. War-mad generals in dark rooms were screaming at our leaders to launch the nukes. Incompetent and greedy politicians tried to appeal to a population that wasn't interested in buying that BS anymore. Religious nuts everywhere proclaimed that god would smite the alien threat out of the sky, while different flavours of religious nuts claimed that the aliens had come to us after Elvis had begged them to save us, and that they'd take us to Alpha Centauri to get enlightened. People debated furiously on the internet if the aliens were the hot variety and we were meeting an alien version of Captain Kirk soon, or whether they were the weird aliens who'd test the mettle of man, whatever that means.

A metric tonne of people were running around like headless chickens, screaming and confused, until the message was successfully translated by a small group of language nerds who'd rigged up a receiver from some old radio equipment. The elites in cryptography, linguistics, diplomacy, and other branches were thoroughly annoyed by this, but a lot of people in such positions are elites because they're ambitious, not because they're actually particularly competent. The message from the stars, first contact, turned out to be very different from what we'd expected. It wasn't threats, offers of Kirkian delights, promises of salvation, Elvis music, or even an offer to join the galactic community. It was a desperate plea. For help. An entire fleet of desperate war refugees. ''*Please hide us.*'' They asked of us. They were willing to give us their ramshackle and ancient ships, any technology they still had, if we'd just let them in, give them citizenship, and allow their long journey to end.

Of course, a large amount of paranoid nuts, xenophobic bigots, and other scum who happens to be politicians, weren't interested. But a few nations reached out. A few places allowed them in. Of course, the aliens didn't accept every offer. They weren't interested in joining North Korea. And the offer from the US was worrying to say the least, considering the sheer amount of information that the US had revealed in the days before the message was translated about aliens. Especially about how they'd captured a lot of scouts, explorers, traders, castaways, scientists, wildlife tourists, and other extra-terrestrials. And how they'd then done unspeakable horrors to them in various laboratories. The videos shown to the UN were leaked during the initial crisis, and suffice to say very few people defended the actions of the United States operated Majestic 12 and the MIB agency after that. The US probably shouldn't have hired all those ex-regime people after World War II to assist them in their work on anti-alien defence.

Mostly, the aliens settled colder regions, having evolved on a planet that while within the habitable zone, was a good deal further from the sun than Earth is. New Zealand, the Nordic countries, northern Japan, southern Chile and Argentina. And those nations received the bulk of alien goods and doodads, though they did of course share them with their allies, and the rest of the United Nations. Of course, various autocratic countries, such as 60% of the UN security council, grumbled about not getting to keep all the cool stuff for themselves. The aliens didn't care much. They were just happy about getting off of their decaying ships, after years in them. Food and water was practically down to only recycled parts. Breathable atmosphere production generators onboard had run out of spare parts and were close to breaking down in most of the ships. And the radiation shielding had started to fail as well. They built some underground cities of their own in the nations that had granted them asylum, got their citizenship, and then just spent a lot of time adjusting. Because most of them were teens or children.

They had fled. After them were hunters. Conquerors. Bloodthirsty warriors. The sort of people that mankind sometimes seem to resemble, but without any of our virtues. Turns out that the galaxy is embroiled in a terrible bloody and senseless war. The sort that we really thought would be impossible at the scale it was waged. But nevertheless it was being waged, and it was going sour. Or so our new alien friends said. Certainly it seemed that way from an outsider's perspective. Mass conscriptions, entire planets retrofitted for a total war, entire races caught in the crossfire, destroyed by the ravages of interstellar war as the frontline shifted. Earth, being the absolute total backwater it was, would have the same chance of being attacked as Antarctica had of being invaded during World War One. Civilisation was crumbling everywhere. The galaxy turning in on itself in a horrible civil war. And it was no longer clear if there even was a side, or if everything had just turned to a constant bloody case of battle-crazed warlords, who'd continue fighting until every planet had been ruined, every FTL-capable ship had been destroyed, until FTL capable civilisation as a concept had been wiped out.

And our new alien friends had been put in any old ship that still functioned, and had been sent away by their parents and government. Because the war was coming to their small interstellar nation. Before the war there had been 50 billion of them distributed over 15 star-systems. About 12 million had reached Earth. Notably, there had been about half a billion of them in way more ships when they first fled. These were just the survivors. Some of our sociologists noted that not only had most of their species in the biological sense been destroyed, they'd had to cannibalize most of their equipment, including their databases full of cultural achievements, just to get here. All of their culture, all of their history, wiped out. There would be some that remained. A few who remembered old stories, who'd write down as much as they could. But the continuation of their culture was gone. And soon enough, as they grew more accustomed to life on Earth, and we adapted more of their remaining technology, they started to act and think like the people they lived with. You'd go to some city in Finland, and find the Finns now came in a short vaguely furred variety, as well as the usual evolved apes.

They were however, only the first to come. The name of their species is an academic or medical term at best. In mindset and behaviour, they're fully human today. But then again, how could they grow to be anything else? A species of traumatized children and teens, refugees, finding a home, and finding that the hosts were quite friendly and accommodating to them. When the humans who helped them, who gave them succour, who taught them peace, and took them in, accidentally infected them with human culture, is there really anyone to blame? Possibly not. But then again, they were only the first. About the time when mankind had some permanent bases on the Moon and Mars, another fleet of ragged aliens came. A bit odd as well, desert-dwellers. Vaguely humanoid, if not for the extra arms and centaur-like bodies. Given home on Earth, they became techno-nomads in the Sahara, and converted fully to the faiths there. They had been a spiritual race, but when their world died, so did their gods who had been of that world and that star. An omnipresent deity to them was something to soothe that part of them that felt lost. They too became human. As human as the other people in that area. Same names, same god, same languages even.

Throughout the latter half of the 21st century, this happened periodically. An alien race, maybe a few million, sometimes only a few thousand, came to Earth. They begged to be hidden. Begged for sanctuary. Begged for a place where they could survive. The backwater world became a hub for the lost, the dispossessed, the exiles, and the deserters. Every group came, gave their technology to mankind, and received a home either on Earth or on one of the other planets. Some old-fashioned people complained about the lack of space as these infrequent unfortunates kept coming, but that was solved when one alien refugee ship had a piece of barely understood technology that somehow terraformed Venus overnight; got the planet moving at a reasonable speed too. It was a weird golden age for mankind. But a terribly tragic one for the galaxy at large. Prosperity, diversity, political reform, technological advancement. Resource shortages were practically non-existent as mankind came closer and closer to a post-scarcity society. Every pre-contact nation was now mostly equal in terms of education, health, safety, and many other good sociological things. Democracy sadly hasn't advanced as much, with only a few nations truly shifting over to free elections, letting go of autocratic regimes. Mankind cannot win every struggle.
