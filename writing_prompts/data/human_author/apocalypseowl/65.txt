With the last strength in my body, I plunged down my sharp blade into the skull of the serpentine monster. With a roar that might be heard from here to Kythera, it dies. One of Typhon's accursed spawn, it had laid waste to the lands of the Achaeans, killing hundreds of strong warriors and valiant women alike. Towns laid to waste, fields turned barren, as the creature spread its vile poison everywhere. Wise Polybius of Megalopolis had charged me with its slaying, for I am not a mortal man like others. I am a hero, a demigod like Heracles and Achilles before me. My mother was seduced by Zeus in the shape of a wolf. This caused her no end of trouble, at the hands of wrathful Hera, who has been the bane of many women and many demigods, when they're born bastards due to her husband's ministrations. In my veins flow not merely the blood of men, but the ichor of the gods. Polybius had said to me, that the slaying of such a monster would surely gain me the attention of my father, the king of Olympus. And much glory from the city-states of the Archean League. It had been a difficult fight, for the monstrous creature had been spawned from the only creature to have ever bested Zeus, and I still cannot believe that I have won. I collapse on the hillside, my sides torn by its claws, my shield-arm cut off, lying just out reach. My remaining eye stares up into the sky, where Zeus might have been watching me. ''*I dedicate this death, to you, father!*'' I call out, with a tired voice.

And above me, I see something. An approaching shape, riding across the sky. I am so tired, so spent, so finished. My bones are crushed, my ichor-blood flows into the hills made barren from the monster's noxious poisons. And where my blood has spilled, the land is reborn. I reach out to the figure, someone striding through the sky atop a great silvery horse. My swordarm connects, I grasp onto the offered hand and I am pulled onto the horse. A woman clad in armour, to carry me to my reward. Is this Nike, the goddess of victory? Here to deliver me to the house of my father, where I shall be raised on high, or perhaps to the Elysian Fields, that most pleasant part of the house of Stalwart Hades? Where the great heroes of the past, Achilles and Patrocles, cunning Odysseus, nimble Atalanta, mayhap even mysterious Medea, and many others await me as one of their own? As she rides through the sky, carrying me, I feel the pain of my wounds seep away. I feel my bones reset, and though my left arm and right eye are no more, the pain of their passing is gone. The air of the high sky is cold, but good. Refreshing. The accursed stench of acrid poisons vacate my lungs.

And we arrive. A grand hall, with a roof made from solid gold! Where I see many great warriors, clad in strange armour, assembled! Proud and strong, they train their tremendous skill against each other! From inside the grand hall I smell delicious meat cooking, and hear voices singing strange but mighty songs of valour and glory! And the mounts here, so grand that even Alexander's Bucephalus would be honoured to share stables with them! And even a... a grey horse with legs like a spider? There are both men and women here, fighting as equals, many of them with hair like gold or red fire? And in the distance, a tree the size of a mountain, so grand I cannot see where its crown is, nor where its roots begin. If this is the Elysian Fields, or the halls of Olympus, they've certainly got a different style than the one we have back home. Not bad, mind you, but quite different. We land in front of the entrance to the great hall. I dismount easily, the strength in my body returned. ''*Welcome, great warrior, soon we shall have a new arm forged for you, but today, you are expected inside; Enter, o valiant warrior, to the halls of the valorous slain!*'' The divinely beautiful woman clad in armour on the horse, after telling me this, flies off again on her majestic steed.

Well, if I am expected, perhaps this is a place where my father will meet me. At long last, recognition, valour, and no more constantly getting tormented by Hera's jealousy. I did not ask to be born of one of Zeus' mortal lovers, after all. With swelling joy, I enter the hall. And it is great beyond belief. Thousands upon thousands of tables are filled with warriors, and thousands more are empty. There is food aplenty, strong drink by the scent of it, and at the centre, a raised table where the gods sit. I do not immediately recognise them, but I can clearly see that they are gods. Their bodies practically shine with divine power. Where they sit even seems brighter than the rest of the room, as the sheer power in them radiates out. I move past many warriors, great and strong, their bodies bulging with muscles, the strongest mortal men can be. As I move towards the centre of the room, I begin to understand their strange language, as the power of the gods in this place must make all men able to understand one another. Some are talking of battle tactics, some are discussing whether their living kin will make it here. But many are singing. A hymn of battle. One of the gods leads them, playing on a lyre that sounds like magnificent thunder. The song is about my victory. I am moved beyond belief. I have entered the hall of the gods, and here the valiant dead are honouring me. Honouring my victory over a creature of the darkest sort.

My own divine parts swell in strength, shining bright beyond my mere flesh, though when compared to the gods, I am but the candle before the inferno. An old god, missing his eye, great black birds on his shoulders, and a magnificent spear in his hands, rises. I do not know of him, but it is clear he is mighty. Perhaps Hades, firstborn son of Kronos? He raises a golden chalice towards me and speaks with a voice that sounds like the power inherent in the very bones of the Earth. A voice which could silence the very seas, and break mountains. Not a loud voice. But merely unbelievably powerful. ''**Be welcome, son of Zeus, to the Halls of the Slain! Be welcome, great warrior, amongst the greatest of the dead! Thrice I bid you welcome you to my halls, to Valhalla, the seat of power for Odin, king of the Aesir, slayer of Ymir!**''

And who exactly is Odin again? But then again, the gods have many names. This is commonly known.

''*I have not heard this name before, mighty Odin, might I ask for other names of yours?*'' The old god's mouth spread in a wolfish grin. Above me the very roof of the halls began to writhe and groan ominously. He did not merely look like an old man, an aged warrior god, but like a great and terrible king. Like something that dwarfed me. Something ancient and powerful, like a titan at the height of their power. ''**Of course, Gena√≠os, son of Zeus. And I will even tell you some of them. I am called: Glad-of-War! The Terrible One! King of the Dead! True-Guesser, Bolwerkr, Grimnir, Wanderer, Gallows-King, Rune-God, and Lord Of All-Worlds! I am the Third Son of Bor, who was the son of Buri, who was spawned in the raw chaos of the Ginungagap! I am the All-Father, who carved the first man and woman! My ravens are Thought and Memory, my wolves are Feri and Greki! I have as many names as men have ways to die, as many titles as there are powers! By my will alone the End of All Things, Ragnarok, is kept at bay! I am ODIN; Lord of Asgard, and all other realms as were forged by me and my brothers from the corpse of Ymir!**'' The power he expended was nothing short of tremendous. Incomprehensible. I have met gods before. Hera has hounded me, Apollo took me and my mother in once and taught me to play beautiful music. I have even seen the face of my father Zeus, though only once, when he bade me rise to become the best I could be, and perhaps I could follow in the path laid before me, to become worthy of ascending to Olympus. I've fought sons of Ares on the battlefield, and I've seen Athena secretly advising leaders. Nothing compared to the raw power of Odin.
