''*Yeah, that you're aliens.*'' Both of them looked at this slimy man incredulously. ''*Did you come here alone?*' She asks, putting all of her corrupting powers in it. ''*Well no, I've got a few mates here.*'' He waves a hand, and they suddenly notice that the club is empty, expect the two of them, and a group of very poorly dressed weirdos armed with nothing but regular guns. She can smell it, there isn't any blessed silver in those bullets, can't harm her. Neither is there any profaned gold from a pagan idol melted down in them, so the angel isn't in danger either. ''*I think we overestimated you.*'' The scruffy angel says as he stands up. She can only nod. These morons aren't a threat. ''*What did you do to the servers, the staff?*'', her addiction acts up again, that damnable desire to do good. The slimy man laughs. ''*I can tell that you're clearly the ''angel'' here. Well, sorry to disappoint you, but their deaths serves the greater good. We will become *'' That was all the angel and the ''angel'' needed to hear.

She unfurled her tattered arthropodic wings. And her skin fell to the floor, revealing her shimmering diamond-like insectile carapace. He unveiled his steel-grey wings of sharp feathers, his flaming blade drinking in all the light that the club had to offer, his black robes billowing around him, the winds of Megiddo still shaking him to his core. He even had the remnants of a broken halo floating above his head. The idiots screamed, and began to inexpertly unload their bullets into their immortal bodies. Nothing of human make alone could penetrate her outer shell, and nothing profane could truly harm an angel that still had some favour with the **CREATOR**, and she could tell that the Heavenly parent still loved their wayward son. She had last seen him in action during the battle that raged in the heart of Lisbon during the 1755 earthquake. He'd been a killer. She respected that about him, even if she found everything else to be so very gauche and middle-class. They worried too much about these clowns. That their cushy human lives would be revealed. That they'd have to run away.

They had nothing to fear in truth. She leapt at the closest fool and tore him apart with her daemonic claws wielding her many knives. With her humanoid hands she shot at those further away from her. And she laughed. She'd been so silly to feel such fear. After all, these clowns thought that she and him were some kind of aliens. His blade decapitated the gaudy, slimy man that had talked with them, and she judged it a fair kill. One guy then tried to stab the angel from behind, which in her opinion wasn't sporting. So she grasped firmly onto the attacker's head with her taser-hand and turned it up to the sort of taser-energies needed to subdue a werewolf. And fried his face. Their fight against the clowns were a dance of a kind, a deathly waltz, as the two of them moved through the club, killing every single goon that had been moronic enough to do this. Spinning from here to there, jumping over heads, twisting and turning, all to kill these dumb, ignorant fools. It wasn't because it was hard to kill them, but she was determined to upstage that ex-angel by killing in a more artful manner than him. He responded by doing the same. Had they threatened to send the info to an ordained priest or just put enough real facts on the internet, they'd be boned. But even if they had put anything up, their own stupid human brains had made it impossible for their attempted blackmail to be of any real use. At least to her.

She relished in the joy of battle, but it wasn't a full joy. Not really, especially against such terrible enemies. Humanity had once produced warriors of such tremendous training and skill that they could beat some lower-class angels and demons. Now, they produced gangly weirdos who couldn't aim if their life depended on it. Which in this case, it did. Sure, they couldn't kill either of them. But had they concentrated their fire on both of them, they could have retreated with their lives. Now, as she saw the last of them go down, a burning blade thrust into his skull, they had paid for their stupidity. ''*Alright.*'' She clicked as she went to put her human skin back on again. ''*Geez. I feel bad for them, you know, the staff and all that.*'' The angel said as his angelic parts receded into the human flesh again. ''*I'll deal with it.*'' She said, already feeling that upcoming rush of being charitable towards the families of the victims. Yes. She'd move in like a snake, pay for the funeral, arrange the flowering. She'd make all of them beautiful funerals. And it would make her feel *so good.* He nodded, uncertainly, and took out a cellphone which he used to call home.

''*Yeah, it's me. Sorry hon, I met an old, uh, acquaintance, and time got away from me. I'll be home in time for dinner though. Don't worry, I didn't forget the groceries. They're in the car, and it's a cool day. Yes, I remembered to get those tangerines that Alice likes. See you soon, love you.*'' That was something she couldn't understand. To help the humans was a delicious high, an addictive taboo to a demon. But to actually marry one? Touch it. Create offspring with one of them? Yuck. She felt her carapace shudder underneath her skin. ''*Hopefully, this will be the last time we'll meet. Enjoy your human life, demon.*'' She could only agree. Honestly. It was politically advantageous to cooperate on this specific matter, even if it wasn't worth all that worrying. But working with one of *them*, even a deserter, was just too weird to do often.
