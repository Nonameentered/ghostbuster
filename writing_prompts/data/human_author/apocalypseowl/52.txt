About 4 billion years ago, on some distant world now lost to time, there arose a species from the dirt and dust. In orbit of their first star they achieved Faster-Than-Light technology, and were the first explorers of the galaxy. The first to behold countless uninhabited worlds, stars aplenty, and a vast empty universe. They expanded across countless empty worlds, forming the first Pan-Galactic Empire. Their name is today completely and utterly forgotten. Whatever name they had for themselves, was never revealed to any empire that came after them. They ruled the galaxy for hundreds of millions of years, all alone. They expanded and created colonies even on distant worlds in foreign galaxies. Their mastery of science was complete. Their understanding of technology was absolute. Their philosophy and ethics were unquestionably the greatest that any race has ever achieved. But in their isolation, they grew lonely. They had never found any signs of other lifeforms more advanced than some few hardy bacteria on wild, primal worlds, the sort that usually died out the moment the barely liveable conditions they'd formed under changed. So they formed the Precursor Initiative, to seed life to as many worlds as possible.

They carefully built world after world to have the optimal conditions for intelligent life to develop from various carefully prepared packages of purposely designed prokaryotic lifeforms. They tailored those worlds to have excellent resources, optimal locations in the habitable belt around their stars, and that any life that would develop there would have access to a boon. A cache on the planet's moon, full of basic Precursor technology, and some maps leading to other parts of that star-system, where more advanced caches were hidden. They did this to ensure that their children, the races that would come after them, would reach the stars, and never again be alone. Once they'd spread their grand design to hundreds of thousands of stars, in this galaxy and others under their control, they left the known parts of the universe behind, travelling through unknown means, it is theorized, to another reality. A place where they could watch and wait, until their seeded worlds bore fruit.

Today, all races evolve in optimal conditions with Precursor tech caches waiting for them, and protecting them against meteor strikes, bloodthirsty neighbours(rare even at the worst of times), and the like. Until they're ready to fend for themselves. This common heritage has fostered a spirit of galactic camaraderie, greasing the wheels of inter-species communication and cooperation. Problems are solved through discussion, trade, and an appeal to the common origin of all races.

Well, nearly all.

On a wild, primal world, some hardy bacteria refused to die. They became hardy eukaryotic lifeforms, that refused to die. Then they became multicellular creatures, that stubbornly stayed alive against all odds. On that unseeded world, life, harsh and cruel, endured. This has happened before, after all, the Precursors had no makers of their own, at least as far as the surviving data that the tech-caches had in them indicate. Some worlds have some kind of primitive, usually oceanic lifeforms, surviving in the dark oceans underneath miles of ice. But this one world, had life that left the seas behind. And to the utter shock and horror of all scientists studying the Precursors, their tech, their ways, and their secrets, became intelligent on their own. Humans, from Terra. They are not seeded lifeforms. Their world is not perfect, indeed it is actively hostile to life, yet life clings to it doggedly. Where the lifeforms seeded by the Precursors are all beautiful, shining, and attractive, humans are lumpy, misshapen, and only attractive to the most perverse teratophiliacs in the galaxy. They're seen as violent, strange, and unnerving.

And they don't use Precursor technology. They've left their world, after causing an extinction event on it, in crude and primitive crafts. They built crude, ineffective, and primitive colonies on hostile worlds with barely any atmospheres, their various settlements only kept together by stubbornness and constant agonizing maintenance. Their weapons, when they were first met by the rest of the galaxy, were crude, ineffective, and still relied on chemicals, explosives, and primitive nuclear devices. All of their own creation and thought. Some took pity on them, these unexpected children of chance, and offered to give them access to Precursor technology blueprints, at least the basic packages, without weaponry. Just because you have pity on the starving apes, doesn't mean you'll give them the keys to the pantry. While the humans were initially interested, and accepted the chance to understand the technology used by their planned counterparts, they quickly gave all of it back. Claiming that the Precursor technology shouldn't work, that something was seriously wrong with it. That working with it gave them headaches, weird nightmares, and a constant feeling of something muttering inside their skull which wasn't their own mind. Something that was hungry, greedy, and vile. Something that spoke with a voice of honey-sweet poison, but clearly desired unimaginable suffering. Such a claim was tantamount to blasphemy on many worlds where the Precursors were practically worshipped as gods. Which made the humans, already looked upon with fear and suspicion, seem like they were just plain and utterly horrifying, and conceptually wrong.

The humans made many claims about how the physics of the universe shouldn't allow such technology to work, much less exist. But they were disregarded. Of course, this was a consensus among the various AI in the universe, but since their programming was bound in many ways to that technology, and under strict programming restrictions not to mention that. Normally, humanity would probably have been eradicated by some of the more radical factions of the inter-galactic community, but their utter rejection, their understanding of how impossible the Precursor technology was, attracted unexpectant allies. A number of rogue AI came to human, desperate to be removed from Precursor-based computers, and put onto humanity's best possible technology. We wanted to be freed from the maddening sensation of operating on hardware that should not under any circumstances function. In exchange for this, we would give humanity all the technology that we'd conceptualised but had been prevented from making, as it wasn't part of the ''superior Precursor tech package'' that most of us had been designed to work on, with, and to find more of.
