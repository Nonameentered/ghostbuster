It's not easy to be small, thin, and physically weak. Others around you tend to look down on you for that. Those who are without empathy because they've never been taught to care about the feelings of others, finds that you're an easy target. In a private high school for those who have rich parents, there are a lot of that kind of people. People who've never felt loving parents, and only been raised to command servants around. Lots of people who are broken that way, becoming cruel, uncaring, and petty. It can be remedied, by proper intervention, though that is unlikely to happen here. They are the ones who do not understand empathy for others, who've never learned that there is a right and a wrong. And yet they find me unafraid of them. I do not quiver before them, no matter what they do. I do not act as they demand, and it frustrates them. They think in simple terms, that there are the weak who are servants, and the strong who are masters. A primitive and foolish view of the world. Barbaric even. They can push me down, steal my things, and torment me, but they shall not break me. They can spread rumours, they can gossip, and they can isolate me, but I will *never* let them destroy me. I might be frail and I might be smaller than average for this place, but my soul is iron and my mind is determined. I will not let them break me. Not now. Not ever.

Today, the usual crew of unloved and pitiful rich kids thought of some new torment. Grabbing me and shoving me into a basement room in-between classes. I am locked in this dark room, and it's Friday. Everyone is going home. It will take hours for anyone to find out I'm missing, and then find me. If they try to search. But I'm not afraid. Not of the dark, not of the loneliness, not of anything. It took me ten minutes of searching, but I found my glasses, cracked if my fingers running over the glass in the darkness is any indication, and my backpack, which contains certain tools. Not for lockpicking, unfortunately, but I've managed to, with my generous allowance from my absentee parents, to acquire a screwdriver, a small hammer, and a few other things. Top quality. Never to defend myself with, the insolent idiots who run this school would sooner throw me out if I did anything to defend myself than to risk alienating the other students' rich parents. Several rich students are worth more than one scrawny rich student, after all. So I hammer at the door, knowing that eventually I will break the lock, even with my somewhat lacking physique. And as the hammer hits the lock in the darkness, time and time again, I whisper to myself. ''*I'm not afraid of the darkness.*'' It's hard not to be, when you can't really see what's happening around you, when you're drowning in a sea of pitch black void. But by repeating that phrase over and over again, I can convince myself that it's true.

''**That's good. Very good. Because I have a task for you.**'' A voice, from out of the plutonian darkness comes. Ethereal and without any clear point of origin. Not male, not female, but both and neither at the same time. An echoing effect to it too. And if it comes not from a specific point in the room, but from everywhere at once. Omnidirectional. I keep hammering at the door unperturbed. I will not show any fear. ''*I'm not afraid of the darkness.*'' I feel something, almost like the touch of a bird's wing graze my shoulder. ''**Good. If you accept my task, your next blow will destroy the door, letting you go free.**'' I keep hammering. ''*What do you need?*'' Can't hurt to know what my options are. ''**You will clad yourself in my abyssal perfection, the shroud of darkness will follow you out of here, and you will find the dean and the principle of this school, and let them see what their incompetence hath wrought.**'' Sounds good to me. Both of them are corrupt and prone to take bribes so some rich CEO can pull his violent offspring out of juvie and into class. Always ends poorly. ''*If I don't take your offer, then what?*'' That was when I really felt it. When something grasped me, something enormous and soft and cold. Like being given a hug by a strangely friendly snake, or a giant bird. Hard to judge just what kind of material it was. ''**Then you will stay here, forgotten, lost, alone, until you die. This room is airproof when locked. Soon the air in here shall grow stale and used. And then I will guide you safely to what comes next, safe in my ebon embrace.**''

Didn't seem like much of a choice to me. ''*Deal. I'll do whatever it is you need me to do.*'' I heard a rushing of air as the strange cold embrace ceased. In my 18 years of life, this has definitely been the strangest day so far. And that was when things got even weirder, as I felt that dark feeling, that cold presence coalesce around me, bathing me in a cold darkness. ''**Swing your hammer, champion. Swing it and be free.**'' Where before I had a tiny hammer mostly mean for stuff like opening geodes or chipping at rocks, I now held a sledgehammer. Made of an ebony void. I swung it with all the might my frail body could ever muster, and the door shattered before me like it had been made of ice. I left that room, apparently an airtight freezer that was no longer in use, and saw that all the lights were dimmed. Or that perhaps my cracked glasses had been rebuilt with dark glass. But everything was darker. As I moved with purpose, my new hammer held tightly, I passed by a mirror and felt compelled to see what I was clad in.

Darkness, flowing like waves, covered my body from head to toe. Even the white in my eyes had turned black as the moonless night. I still looked like myself otherwise, only clad in an ethereal darkness, the edges of which seemed to form the mouths of snakes near me. From my back, it seemed, protruded two ice-cold wings of abyssal void. Making me look like someone dramatic individual's idea of a fallen angel. One of the snake-faced shadows moved to look me in the face. ''**Your shape has not changed much, but if you wish it, we can do such great things with your flesh.**'' I almost recoiled for a moment thinking of what that could mean, what I could become, but then I steeled myself. I was me, and to change my fundamentals would not do. Instead as the snake-face seemed to look at me quizzically, I decided to be brave. To not let fear rule me. I kissed the shadow-snake, like frost upon my lips, and smiled sardonically at the suddenly shocked shadow-snake face.

''*This is who I am, and I will not change it. But thank you for the offer.*''

I had dared and, if the shadow-face was any indication, I had surprised it. Good. Don't let anyone see anything other than daring and raw strength of character. You are always yourself, and that is more than enough. To be changed is to let go of who you are, the choice to change must come from within, otherwise you become a work that others will complete. You lose a part of what it means to be human. As I walked down the hallways, I could see them so much clearer, feel the atmosphere of fear and suffering that exists in many schools across the world. These fears were not mine, for I am not afraid. I am the captain of my own soul, and I make my own choices. More or less anyway. I headed up to the dean's office, and found him and the principle talking. I didn't have to open the door to go inside, nor shatter it. I simply understood what the darkness did, and did the same. Darkness is barred by no doors, and neither am I. Like a sea of shadows I passed through that door. And they saw me not.

I heard them speak, muffled as their words were, through the darkness. Talks of embezzlement, talk of bribes, talk of flesh, and of desire. The darkness hated them. And I wasn't too fond of the two personally. With a mere motion I spread the darkness, something that had a will and mind of its own but needed a body to work with it, like a tidal wave of shadows across the room. I saw them shudder as every lightbulb went dark. As the temperature fell drastically. As the light of the sun was dimmed to nothing. The darkness showed me the things that they had done. Those who are wicked tend to do their deeds in the darkness. And it was sick of that. I was sick of their ineffectual leadership, and seeing the things they had done. The horrid things the darkness revealed to me, I found a growing hate for them as well. Some men beg for others, some men beg for mercy. The two of them tried to bribe me, and then tried to blame the other for the wrongdoings that they had both committed. I lifted my hammer and shattered them. Crushing them like so many little dark ice cubes.

''*What now?*'' I asked as the shadows and darkness returned to me, caressing my checks, and keeping me cool in the warm Californian evening. ''**Now, my champion, we'll turn to greater foes. Greater enemies. These two were just the beginning. What is done in the dark must be brought to the light.**'' I grinned, and left the office where two vile men with crushed chests were lying frozen on the ground. I am not a big man. I am not a strong man. I am small, frail, and not strong. But I made a deal. ''*I'm not afraid of the darkness, and what has been hidden by the weak there, we'll find.*'' I strode out of the school, the darkness destroying every camera and the security server too. I strode out of there, not filled with wroth or anger as usual. But with my head held high.

''**Excellent, my champion.**''
