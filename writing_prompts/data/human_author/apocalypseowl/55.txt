The desert night is cold and in a truly transcendental way, very desolate. Only the cold dark sands beneath your feet as far as the horizon stretches and the infinite ocean of stars above you. To travel through such places is possibly the closest a man can come to experience the emptiness of an uncreated void. There is little movement, if any. There are no grand vistas to distract you, no tumultuous ocean to stir the soul within you. There is only the sands, the stars, and the strangely cold wind that chills you to the bone. This vide and vast land is hostile to human life, and only barely tolerate our journeys through it. I am alone here, in body and spirit. My companions I lost in a sandstorm three days past. My camel laid down and refused to move again, dead by the sting of a dread scorpion. Poor beast, though that death is far faster than the one I see in my own future. Almost merciful. I have wandered in one direction ever since. Hiding in my meagre tent during the scorching day, getting what little rest I can, while I wait for night to come again. My throat like dusty old parchment calls out for the last of my water, and regretfully I find that I must part my dry lips to provide myself a final drink. The water is brackish, warm, and tastes like it has been sitting too long in its flask, yet it is to me a greater experience than drinking the most expensive and valued vintages of the finest vineyards of the world.

It must be enough. Were I not in the deep Sahara, perhaps I could find something to drink, but alas, I know not the signs of hidden oasis', nor if any beasts are around. Blood is a terrible thing to drink, as I am not a vampire, but when the choice is between life now and parasites, or death by thirst, the choice is easy. Though that choice is moot when there has been no sign of any life anywhere in this utter desolation. At least none I recognise. The desert can be lived in, adapted to, by animals over time. I have not the time to evolve nor the idea on how to do so on my own.

To my distress, the final water in my can has not dispelled the hallucinations, it seems. There is still a mirror in the desert. In the distance, it serves as the only noticeable feature amidst the dunes. Miles tall, and quite wide, it does seem like something you'd hallucinate. But there it is. And with no other recourse left to me, I must at least discover what I can about it before the desert leaves me a desiccated husk, naught but dried up old bones. It has been there in the distance since last night, but I discounted it, couldn't be real. Now, I don't know what it might be. As I get closer it certainly seems real. A dark chunk of mirrored glass, a vertical mirror reaching into the stratosphere, far further than I can see with my eyes. How can this not have been discovered? There are so many satellites in orbit that one of them should have noticed something so patently absurd as a mirror like this? It reflects the dark sands, the dunes, with eerie perfection. Something like this should have been damaged over the ages, the grinding sandstorms should have made it incapable of casting any form of reflections.

And yet, as I get closer, it does indeed seem to be showing a perfect reflection of the desert. Almost perfect. I cannot see myself in it. I do not approach it. I have no reflection. Perhaps I have died. Perhaps this is my afterlife. Roaming an endless desert, always thirsty, never finding respite. And yet that doesn't concern me as much as the other things I see in that mirror. As I get closer and closer I see the ghastly visage of mummies, dried up desert husks, and other dead men. Dressed in various forms of clothing from countless eras. There, in the mirror, a man dressed as a foreign legionnaire, there a Bedouin merchant, there a noble from the court of Mansa Musa, judging from the golden jewellery he is adorned with. There a pilot of the RAF, his dry arm raising a rusty pistol towards a man dressed in the uniform of Rommel's Afrikakorps. Impoverished Tuaregs, Italian officers, someone who looks like an American business idiot, countless people from various parts of Africa wearing vestiges of traditional clothing. Oldest of all seem to be a tall man with the crown of a pharaoh, atop a chariot pulled by long skeletal horses. All of them seem to be staring into the mirror.

Perhaps my predecessors. Others, lost in the desert, seeing a great mirror in the distance, hoping it will lead them somewhere. Anywhere. None of the skeletal beings in the mirror are moving. All of them are just staring. As I come stand before it, my hand reaches out to the reflective surface. It doesn't reflect. The mirror feels cold and real when I touch it. Staring into it, I see something behind me. Or through me, perhaps. Moving towards me. It is a figure that defies human comprehension. But I can feel that it has something to say. The way its mouth moves. The way I can almost hear the voice. A voice that sounds like the grinding of sand upon flesh. A voice that is the voice of the desert.

The words come to me. Almost like I am remembering them, just as I see the thing's mouth move. **DO YOU WISH FOR LIFE?** It asks me this. I nod, of course I want to live. I want to get out of this desert. **ARE YOU WILLING TO GIVE UP LIVING IN THIS WORLD TO LIVE ELSEWHERE?** Death in this desert. Or life somewhere else? I cannot escape from here on my own. My water is gone. Sand everywhere, and no way home. What choice is there. Either way, my family will never see me again. Either way, my works will not be continued. Either way, I can never return home again. **THOSE YOU SEE IN THE MIRROR DID NOT WANT TO GIVE UP THEIR LIVES; THEIR WEALTH, DUTY, POWER, AND FAMILY WERE TOO IMPORTANT FOR THEM. THEY DIED HERE. THE SANDS TOOK THEIR FLESH AND WATER.** Underneath me, I feel the sands move and twist, revealing a mass of horrid bones underneath me. Many are the people I see in the mirror. Officers, kings, rich men. People who did not dare to give up everything, for the chance of life. In the desert, all the riches in the world are worth nothing, compared to a mere droplet of pure clean water. **YOU WILL ASSUME NEW FLESH. IN A LAND BEYOND THIS REALM. AND YOU CAN NEVER RETURN HOME AGAIN.** I nod. My throat, despite the earlier water, is too parched to form words.

I willingly give up what I have here in this world. It is not an easy choice, but to live is to have the chance to regain everything you've lost. To walk the desert alone and lost is to die.

**THEN STEP INTO THE MIRROR**

Closing my eyes, I walk forward, into the mirror, where that strange indescribable shape stares at me with inhuman eyes. It feels cold, and wet. And painful. Like every cell in my body is screaming and changing. But I keep moving forward. Until I fall. I open my eyes only to see, a brief moment before I break the water, a small lake underneath me. I fall into the clean water, and I almost cannot stop my body from reflectively trying to drink the entire body of water. Instead, I force myself to swim, and reach the shore of the lake instead. Once there, I find a small stream leading into the lake, and drink from that instead. Perhaps there are parasites or dangerous bacteria in the water, but I don't care too much. It's water. After days in the desert, this is paradise. Once I've drunk my fill and then some, I walk down to the lakeshore, and look at myself in the mirror-surface of the lake. My flesh is no longer that of a human being. I am shorter than I was before. I have an elongated snout. My body is covered in snake-like scales, yet I can tell that I am still warm-blooded, which is unusual. My clothes don't fit particularly well anymore, but I've still got my backpack, and I've got some sutures, needle, and such. I can make them fit. The swishing reptile tail behind me will take some getting used to though.

A new life. A new land. A new body. Better than dying in my old flesh, back in the desert. I fill my canteen with clean water from the spring leading into the lake, and begin working on my clothes. Once I am done, I shall walk around the lake, looking for traces of people, houses, smoke, boats, the likes.
