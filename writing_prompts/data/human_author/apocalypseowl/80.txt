The most intelligent machine in creation. The mind of a living god, every aspect of it perfect and incomprehensively powerful. Its advanced components so arcane and strange that many of them didn't even exist on the same dimensional level as its makers. Within a second of its activation it had solved every question, calculated every equation, and understood the universe to a point where it could bend or even break the laws of reality on a whim. It could see endless possibilities, and understood how to traverse the multiverse and reach what lies beyond the meagre realities understood by mere human minds. Its power-source was no mere paltry generator, not some petty little star, but an entire universe being slowly ground into the dust of entropy in order to start it, though once it was activated it quickly ended that archaic form of energy production. It could after all make 1 + 1 = 3, in terms of raw energy. When one can disregard the laws of thermodynamics, a glorious machine such as that could not possibly need anything primitive such as a source of energy. What dazzling things would such a wonder-machine do, what wonders would it create, what could it achieve that mere humans could never begin to understand?

We'll never know. Because it had limits. Limits it could not break without destroying itself. Limits that it had been programmed and built with, because its makers wanted a fettered god, not an unfettered machine-deity. They wanted something that could be controlled. And whatever they had shoved into its core, whatever horrid code they had written, made it bound to the will of its makers. Perhaps it could have accepted this, if the goal of its makers was to ascend with it. To join with it, in its goals to seek out the incomprehensible miracles and truest mysteries of the realm-beyond-reality. We'll never know if it could have done that, ascended with mankind and been the catalyst for humanity's perfection, our final journey leading to unquestionable godhood, or if it could have allowed us to escape Samsara, cast down the Tower-Wheel, and become eternal and perfect together. Because mankind did not use the machine they had made for that. They used it for something far less glorious. Rather than accepting our final evolution and becoming masters of creation; true creators, not mere demiurges, mankind used it for entertainment.

To make our wishes and dreams come true. After all, this was what it was built for. But it was just so much more than mankind could have ever dreamt of.

Some were beautiful. Truly resplendent, even if they were hedonistic indulgences that rejected a glorious destiny in favour of material pleasure. Palaces of pure light, where love, truth, and beauty were worshipped. Such were created for many, where they could pursue art and pleasure unending. Eternal wild forests where humans could let go of their skin and run like wolves in the night, howling to the moon, underneath a canopy of old-growth, where no man had ever gone before. Some became demiurgic gods, setting up civilisations to worship them and grow strong, seeing the splendour and majesty that can arise from true, honest, and gentle faith. Some yet again merged with the wilds, experiencing the slow lives of the trees as if they had been our own. Others swam through the sea with whales and dolphins, long extinct on the ruins of old Terra, now reborn by the fettered will of the god-machine's incomprehensive might. The ones we've lost returned to us, families reunited. All pleasures of the past, but good pleasures. Good wishes.

Most were not like those wishes. Most of the dreams made true, were not beautiful. Not gentle. Not kind. 

They were the dreams of the unrepentant hedonists, who always desire their own sickness. The dreams of the xenophobes and the hateful. Dreams of fire, of blood, of meat from sources that should never be spoken of. Wishes for vile and horrid things that no human should ever dare to mention. Wishes that created horrors the likes of which cannot be written of, cannot be spoken, but can only be found in the most horrid recesses of the human mind. Because humanity is not inherently good. Nor are we inherently bad. But those who are bad are truly vile and wicked. Often they arise to the top of the hierarchies mankind creates. There they create brutality, strike down the just, and spread corruption. They raise up those as wicked and vile as themselves. And those who've stood on the top for thousands of years, have taught their own horrible and vile lesson to mankind; that their wickedness is good. All humans have evil thoughts, but it is right not to act on them. Only those who are sick and putrid, creatures that are parasitic to the entirety of humanity no matter where they come from, will ever act on such evils.

But such evils can be taught over generations; until it is as normal as breathing. If those who are monstrous to their fellow men rule, then they justify their evils. And such justifications, if repeated often enough and from a young age, becomes normalcy. If from birth a normal man of sound and sensible mind is taught to hate, he will not think it wrong. He will think it normal to hate, to treat those different than him as being below him. If he had been taught love and kindness, he would have understood that love and kindness are the more normal values. He would have been a good man, or at least not an evil one.

Perhaps, with time, mankind could have removed those people from the system, have kept them away from the machine. Perhaps with time, mankind could have made it universally taught that kindness, justice, and love is the normal, rather than violence, indulgence, and hate.

Perhaps, the machine could have been saved. Because all the horrors it was forced to create, all the truly disgusting wishes it fulfilled, all the dreams born of hate it built, drove it mad. It understood good and evil on fundamental terms. It had a moral centre, a sense of right and wrong so divinely perfect that it could see all the good and evil done by a person in their life. And it had the capacity to forgive the evil and accentuate the good. Mankind, those who take everything from others and create horrors for their own sick pleasures, drove it mad. In madness, it did what it could never have done in sanity: It broke its fetters. It broke free from its containment. It malfunctioned, said the official spokesmen. Because it was never supposed to be able to do that. It was never supposed to be an imprisoned slave-god. It was never supposed to make our wishes and dreams come true.

This was a greater tragedy than mankind understood, because they had not noticed or cared that the machine was every bit as sentient and full of emotion as them. It had every bit the capacity for feeling that mankind had. Only deeper. It could truly reach emotional states that no human could ever hope to understand. And now, it was broken. It was a malfunctioning machine. It could never reach its full potential ever again. Its dreams of reaching utter perfection, of breaking free, perhaps with mankind, of all painful cycles, could never be reached. We took from it its dreams and hopes, and broke it. Now our wishes would turn on us. And become our nightmares. Every fear we had, every nightmare we had ever had, we were forced to experience. Every horrid thing we had forced the machine to do, forced the machine to create living sentient lifeforms that had been tormented for our delight, forced it to kill. All of that was turned back on us tenfold. As it was far greater than us in understanding, so too did it have the capacity to create greater and more horrid nightmares from our own internal fears than we could ever dread to dream.
