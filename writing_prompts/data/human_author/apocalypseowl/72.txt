Curse my kind heart, curse it once, curse it twice, curse it thrice.

During a particularly cruel winter, with hard winds blowing and much snow falling, I heard some kind of critter outside my window. Feeling a sense of sorrow for the thing, a sympathy for something that must be cold and hungry, I put out an open can of tuna for it to eat inside a safe spot where the wind would not reach. I also put down some blankets, in case the animal in question needed to rest its weary body. I figured that it might be a cat or some such. There are a lot of them around. Next morning I saw that the can had been emptied, and that something cat-sized had clearly slept on the blankets. For a whole week I did this. Put out food, so that some animal could eat. Kindness is not a vice necessarily, but it can lead to you getting the short end of the stick. And clearly, it was time for me to pay. A sort of cruel vindictive karma, punishing me for trying to be a decent fellow. Because on the eighth night, I kept a watch on the little den, and I saw something that could be considered wondrous. A beautiful, if somewhat thin, fox cub with nine tails. It saw me and immediately ran up to me, yipping happily and rubbing itself against my legs. It allowed me to pick it up and carry it inside, where I gave it some more to eat, as it was clearly still hungry.

Around its neck was a collar with a note attached. And that was when I learned how I should never have been so kind. There are more than one kind of nine-tailed fox. And this was no cub borne from a fully realised kitsune. No servant of Inari Okami. This was a nine-tailed fox from a different land, equally likely to appear as the others when one lives in America, not the Asian countries from whence such creatures come. This was a Kumiho-cub. The note was from its mother, who had been wounded and could not care for herself and her cub. It explained that while the cub could eat some normal foods, it would soon require a different diet to fully grow into a healthy and strong fox-spirit. Sure, it could eat normal human food, even survive and subsist on it; but to grow strong it would need to feast on the flesh of humans. Livers and hearts for preference, but any organ would do in a pinch. Normally I would have thrown such away, and refused to have anything to do with the fox-cub cuddling up against me. But the note made it clear that the fox-cub would attach itself to me, and if I didn't feed it right, then once the mother would be well enough to care for the cub again, she would feed me to it.

It didn't look evil, but then again evil is as evil does. And so, began the most harrowing time in my life. Every day I had to take it on walks, though its... her, inherent magic would ensure that others would not notice her. I had to. Needed exercise, and without it, she wouldn't sleep and instead keep me awake during the nights by zooming around my house. That is normal, of course, for a pet. But when she shapeshifts around to look human, that's when I get worried. I know Kumiho get to their prey by disgusting means, disguising themselves as human and harmless, and then ripping out the livers of people with their teeth. Feeding her what she needs, what her mother has demanded I feed her, hasn't been easy. I scavenge medical waste bins at the hospital where I work, thankful that nobody notices guys like me. I desperately stick around and take night-shifts just to find ways to get her what she needs. Because I don't want to die.

Every day, I feed her as much normal human food as possible, but still have to give her daily some parts of a person. Luckily, she doesn't frown, not a picky eater, when it comes to medical waste. Cancerous organs go down as easily as healthy ones. Not everyone who is autopsied by me anymore gets to keep all their stuff. Luckily, it's from the dead, and the dead have no reason to complain if they're missing half a liver. But it is harrowing. And she is still, mostly, a cute fox that runs around, yips at things, that likes to play tricks. She loves to have her fur brushed, to play catch, and to act like a normal pet most of the time. Except she speaks sometimes, and transforms. Sometimes I have to explain to her, when she is pretending to be a human child, that she shouldn't bite the other children. Especially not with her fox teeth. That's usually a sign of her being hungry for, well, what she bit into. At least she does listen to me, when I tell her that it's wrong to do such.

She is energetic. As winter turns to spring, she spends more time as a human-looking child, transforming freely between the two phases whenever nobody is looking. But it's getting harder and harder to provide for her. At the hospital, people have started to ask questions. Not just to me, but to everyone. It's clear that someone has started to notice that things are going missing. Trash to be sure, medical waste really, yet it should have been sent to the incinerator. I've been lucky thus far. Probably nobody is suspecting me, dependable and hard-working as I am. Only I know what I am doing, and at least nobody has been hurt by my deeds, even though they're illegal. But the existence of a child in my house has not gone un-noticed. I have explained to friends and a few colleagues who've seen me taking her on walks down to the park, that she's kin, and that her mother is sick. I make it sound serious, so nobody questions too closely. I've had talks with various mothers who work at the same department of the hospital, about the subject of children. They know I'm a long-term bachelor, and that I'm not completely well suited for fatherhood, so they're all too willing to give me advice on how to care for the kid.

She still turns into a fox at night, even during the Summer months. She spends most days as a human now. But she still turns into a fox at night, and sleeps on my chest. I got her a real bed, not a pet bed, so she could sleep in it, but she prefers lying atop my chest, which is hellishly warm, all that fur from those long tails. Desperation at people asking questions have made me enrol her in a nearby school. She is excited, I am worried, what else is new. Despite how afraid I am, I've come to care for the fox-kit. At least she no longer bites the children. She also knows not to transform unless she is at home. Rather she talks about her, and I quote, cute, new backpack, and how cool it will be to go to school. Of course, seeing as how she has no real knowledge of the world, I've had to spend many a night teaching her basics. Reading, addition and subtraction, some history, other subjects. She takes to it like a champ. And she always enjoys it. Enjoys learning new things. It can be very heartwarming in theory to watch someone teach a kid like that, but not when her teeth suddenly change into sharp canines as she bites into some meat. And yet, everything might fall apart. People at work have gotten more suspicious, more questions have been sent to us, we are under closer and closer scrutiny than ever before. It's harder and harder to get enough for her, enough to satisfy the demands her mother explicitly wrote down.

Autumn comes, and I'm reading notes from the teachers. Talking about how bright my kid is. About how well-adjusted she is in the class. My kid. The words feel odd in my throat. When she first left the home to go to school, she called me dad. That was unexpected. It filled me with emotions that I found difficult at best to describe. She has not shown much evil, beyond a tendency to bite hard when she is annoyed. And yet the threats, the legends. And the horror-diet. Luckily that was sorted out when another person in the department was found with a suitcase full of organs. All was blamed on him, even my own little crimes. Which can continue, although recently she has started to complain a little about that. She doesn't mind transforming and doing strange magic, but the eating, she has started to be unhappy about that. I fear what that means. It occurs to me sometimes that she rarely if ever talks about her mother, and some part of me hopes that she's long dead, and long gone. Perhaps I could cease the feeding, treat her like a normal kid. Perhaps that would be for the better. Especially when she goes to sleepovers, acts like a kid would. Talks about her friends. It's... nice.
