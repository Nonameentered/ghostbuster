It is a beautiful day.

Perfect for a wedding. And what a wedding it is. Two large families and many personal friends of the groom and bride, coming together to celebrate love. A joining of blood and souls. There are the young flower-girls, innocent and cheerful, ever-so-proud of their job. There are the bridesmaids, happy for their friend, their hearts overflowing with shared joy at the beautiful bride's perfect day. There stands the best man, in his immaculate suit, serious, aloof, and yet in a distant manner quite happy and joyful. The priest smiles; he believes that this might be one of the marriages that truly will last. Too many people rush into marriage, he thinks. These people however, are suitable for it. They're ready. And look at the bride. Her dress makes her look like an angel. Her smile is wide and warm. Her eyes sparkle whenever they meet her husband-to-be's. The ceremony has gone off without a hitch. There were no awkward moments. No rambling speeches. No last minute pranks by edgy young teenage relatives. No; everything was perfectly fine.

And afterwards, at the outdoors dinner celebration, at the height of summer, the food was delicious. Several luaus, huge platters of smoked salmon, seven different kind of salads, turkeys, vegetarian and vegan options, and more. Anyone who would walk home from that dinner dissatisfied with their dining choices was someone who did not in any universe deserve to have the ability to eat. The drinks flowed freely. And merry songs were sung. Many gifts were given, as is tradition for two young people starting their new lives together. Truly, to anyone present, this was a perfect moment. Speeches were held, all of which were lauded for their wit, caring, and cheerfulness. There was even a lively and cheery dance, where young and old felt free to move to the beat, as their hearts desired.

A fork beats against a crystal glass, as the mother of the bride stands up. The crowd turns to look at her, awaiting a speech. She turns and looks at the wedded couple with a smile, though the crowd is puzzled as it is not a happy smile. It is vindictive. Full of a hunger for revenge. A thirst for justice. She points a long arm out towards the groom and speaks with a voice that is without any love. ''*I know what you did.*'' Everyone turns to the groom, shocked over this sudden turn of events. The bride looks hurt. And confused. She keeps looking from her husband to her mother. ''*You thought you could keep it secret. You thought you could hide it. You thought it would remain buried.*'' Slowly, but certainly, the middle-aged woman advanced towards the groom. Above her, the once clear blue sky was filled with black clouds. Where before there had been songbirds in the trees, only a murder of crows could be seen, their quiet cawing indicative of a fear that transcended species. The groom, frightened, almost takes a step back, but stands his ground as his mother-in-law, no, whatever it is that has her in its thrall, comes closer. No-one dares to move towards them. The older relatives are shocked, and feel their bodies shake. The children are weeping in fear, running to their parents.

The mother of the bride finally, after what feels like an eternity, has reached the bride and the groom. She has not stopped staring at the groom the whole time. But at last, the bride throws herself in between the two of them. ''*Let me share what I know, child of mine, and mayhap you will not throw yourself in front of him so easily.*'' She pulled the bride gently towards her, and whispered words into her ear that only she could hear. The bride grew as pale as her dress, hearing those words pass from the lips of her mother into her ears. The bride turned, and stared in abject horror at her groom. Before turning aside to violently throw up. The groom stepped back, slowly, as the mother-of-the-bride began to advance once more. The parents of the groom rushed towards them, finally pulled out of the stupor that they'd been in, followed by the father of the bride. But they were stopped by the bride, who frantically, whispering, told them what her mother had told her. The bride's father, became red like fire with a rage that only a parent can have. The mother of the groom wept. Wept and screamed at the heavens. ''*My boy! My boy! What have I done to fail as a mother!*'' The father of the groom became pale. And turned to the groom. And spoke with a loud, clear, and cold tone.

''*I have no son.*''

He grabbed a dinner knife and advanced towards the groom, joining the mother of the bride in approaching the boy. Soon enough, they were joined by their respective partners. Others ran to the shocked bride, and heard in turn what she had learned. And soon enough, everyone, friend, family, server, the caters, and others, looked upon the groom with an unbridled revulsion. They no longer saw him as a friend. As a member of their circle, a part of their family. His was a crime for which there is no forgiveness. His was a life that should never have been allowed to have been lived. His was a sin too terrible to name. And thus, his end should be one that would be forgotten. Upon this meadow, his bones would have to lie.

The best-man tackled him, pinning him to the ground with the aid of some of the older men, while the bridesmaids gathered the wedding garland decorations to use to tie him up. He struggled underneath them. Their silent judging eyes staring at him with the uttermost revulsion and hatred. They tied him on his hands and on his feet. And carried him away, into the woods. Where the men and women who had not been involved with tying him up, were dirtying their finest clothes digging a hole with their finely manicured hands. They dug deep, caring not for broken nails and hard soil. They only cared for ridding the world of this wolf-in-sheep's-clothing. This rot in their midst. It had to be removed. To be purged from this realm. Down into the black dirt they cast his wriggling body. And together, they buried him underneath that same black soil. He screamed. But they would not stop. Upon his grave they heaped as many stones as they could find, hoping to ensure that he remained buried indefinitely. All afternoon, and all evening, until the dark of midnight, they covered his grave in as many stones, holy sigils, and crosses as they could make. Some poured out gasoline upon the ground, others drove into town, buying toxic chemicals, and into the soil where he laid they poured them as well. So that nothing may grow from his flesh. That nothing may return from him. That forever his flesh would not be allowed to return to nature.

At last, they were done, and tired, exhausted, and wearied, the guests went to their cars. And drove home. Hoping never to remember this day. Vowing never to explain what had happened to the children who had been present. They even forbade their children from mentioning this day ever again. Only the bride and her parents remained. The bride had sat still, merely watching in mute horror as her husband was forced to endure the justice that he had earned from his unmentionable crimes. She moved slowly towards the grave, and with slow, measured movements, she removed the golden ring from her finger. A promise of love and loyalty. A promise that cannot be kept with monsters. And no woman born would ever be loyal to such a man. She placed the ring upon the impromptu grave, and then left the unholy ground behind for good. Supported by her parents, they returned to the car, where she promptly fell into the sleep of the exhausted. ''*How did you know?*'' The father of the widow asked. ''*Look.*'' She showed him something on her phone. Evidence. He looked only for a brief second before turning away. It was all he could do not to vomit. Instead, he turned the car-key, and began to drive away.

Only a murder of crows remained in the trees. Observing. At last, in the dread of the blackest night, they too took flight. Innocents had been avenged. And a monster was dead. The horror had, at long last, been ended.
