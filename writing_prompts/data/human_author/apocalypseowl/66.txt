She was there when I was bullied. She was there when I was lonely. And she was beautiful. In an inhuman way. And considering how everyone who was beautiful in a human way tormented me, made my time in HS miserable, was it any wonder we connected the way we did? We started kissing, holding hands, and doing stuff that was more-or-less innocent. Love, strange and created through proximity as it was, grew between us. Just as I became a legal adult by graduating HS, and becoming 18, she had to go through a process as well. Shortly after I buried granddad, who went through the last couple of years of his life without ever noticing that his granddaughter was hiding her alien insect girlfriend in his barn, she began to build her cocoon. It took some time, and a lot of nourishment, but I was there, helping her through the process. She was a bit scared, to tell the truth. So was I. It would take six months of time, luckily the cocoons her species made could not be penetrated by Earth-Vermin, and was practically as strong as steel on the outside, but easily broken from inside. She would be safe, as long as I watched out for her.

I kissed her goodbye six months ago, when it was finished. Tonight, she is due to emerge.

I finish preparing all the food. She explained that she would be famished by the time she'd emerge, so I prepared all her favourites. All the stuff I fed her that she liked the most over the years. I take it all out to the barn, where the cocoon is already vibrating, more than it has done at any time for the past six months. It's similar to how butterflies and moths on Earth do it. Melt down and then recombine into a new body without any memory loss. Just a whole lot bigger. And much more forceful. The barn itself shook as she writhed inside, and with a might crashing sound, the big cocoon opened and revealed her. The centre of her body was quite similar to before, only covered in a shimmering fuzz.

When she unfolded her wings I began to cry. If we could but place her in the sky instead of the moon at night, all mankind would forsake the day forever, paying no worship to the garish sun. She glowed brightly. Like a firefly would, only all over her body. She crawled out of the cocoon and began to eat with great gusto. I moved over to her, and her antennae began gently stroking my face. I sat down next to her, watching her eating all her favourite dishes. I poured us some glasses of wine, and I offered it to her, she paused and took it. Looking at me with her shiny eyes, cheerful at our long-awaited reunion. I raised my glass, as did she, and we toasted her successful transformation. A lonely girl and a lost alien, celebrating together alone. We ate the cake together, and embraced afterwards, basking in the presence of ourselves, and the love we share. Before she went into that cocoon, we talked about using some of the things she brought with her from the spaceship to build a distress beacon. To leave Earth behind, and see the stars. We'd be vagabonds in space, always on the move, never staying still. We'd see the stars, and never return to the lives we were meant to have.

But that's not important right now. That's for tomorrow. Tonight the woman I love embraces me, and I embrace her. And that's all we need.
