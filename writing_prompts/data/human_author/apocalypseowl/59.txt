Though the losses of mankind were noticeable, they were far more easily replaced than the Imperium's. The British would note that in these worlds, against the Imperium, the old adage, of ''Whatever happens we have got, the Maxim Gun, and they have not.'' was very applicable. Soon the Legion was exhausted, and mankind marched across their first conquered world, and into several others. Local human slaves, freed by the invaders, were rather confused by the whole ordeal, but on the whole they were quite happy to see their former masters driven from their homes. These local humans became very loyal collaborators, as their new rulers treated them, not as equals, but at least better than they'd ever truly experienced before. The Hegemon, seeing their empire collapsing around them, made the ultimate call. These frontier worlds which mankind were taking over, would be sacrificed. The personal and civilians would be evacuated, and their portals would be dismantled, leaving them cut off from the rest of the Imperium, even if it meant that the humans would have their own multi-dimensional realm.

By the time this had been completed, mankind was actually fairly overextended and would probably have been quite willing to broker some kind of peace. But instead, it left the great nations that had ruled the world through the 19th century, capable of taking vast new areas of land for themselves. Having captured some mages, humanity redirected portals so they opened up at least one in every Earth nation involved. The humans had quickly divided the spoils, and ensured that each nation involved had their own planet, or at least continents on a planet, to themselves. Nobody was going to give Belgium their own planet, but they did get a sizable continent of their own. With the war against the extradimensionals over with, mankind fell back into petty bickering and fighting amongst themselves. These were, after all, colonising and imperialist nations, in an age of unprecedented technological advancement. But this time with far more resources, and many scientists who were working on using magic in technology, which had been a thing the dwarves had demonstrated as possible, but had never been perused by the Imperium, because it wasn't worth it when they had so many people able to use magic already. But humans are never ones to stop just because they've already got something that works. And in a small laboratory in Hokkaido, a magically enhanced gun just proved itself feasible, and quite an improvement over older weapons. In a Swedish forest, a representative of the Dynamit Nobel AG company have just successfully tested a form of explosive that only damages organic matter, and one that only damages inorganic matter, one for use as a weapon, one for use in mining. In the United Kingdom, researchers at a secret laboratory in Scotland have just managed to make contact with one of the weird gems that make portals possible. And it is willing to teach the humans how to make more portals, without using the soul-crystals.

On the other side of the portals, the seething and angry Hegemon began to rebuild their forces. And started to consider using darker, hitherto unused, forms of magic, to bolster their armies. They had patience. They had immortality. They had time to rebuild everything, and then drive mankind extinct. However, if mankind on a singular world without magic, but with technology, could give the Imperium so much trouble, how far will mankind go now that they've got multiple worlds, and the knowledge of how to use arcane technology?
