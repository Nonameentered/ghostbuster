Because the great powers of the time would be too greedy to give a whole planet to Belgium(also, having been somewhat ravaged by the early stages of WWI would not have enough manpower or resources to manage a whole world, even if it is primitive), so instead they got a continent on the ''shared alternate world''. Whereas France got 5 whole-ass planets. Britain got 7. The US got 2, Japan 3, Germany 6, Austria-Hungary 2, The Ottomans 1, Italy 1, and Russia 4. Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, and some others, got a continent or parts of a continent on a shared world. It's not one of the better alternate planets mankind manages to take over.
