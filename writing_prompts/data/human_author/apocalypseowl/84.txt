November 22, 1963, even late autumn has done little against the Texan heat, as the young president and his beautiful wife rides through the city of Dallas. He looks, in this moment, every inch the democratically elected helmsman of the nation that leads the free world. He isn't perfect, he has his flaws, as does his nation. But he is charming, he was a war hero back in the 40s when he kept his men alive and got them home after their patrol torpedo boat was sent to the bottom of the sea by the IJN. He is also quite rich, and Americans used to look up to that. Maybe his goals are only immediate political survival. Maybe he has had intercourse with more women than any other man alive. But he is doing his best. Some at this moment might think that he'll get re-elected, that he'll serve the full two terms. Some think that the other side is going to oust him. One man knows the fate of the president, however. And it's not a good fate. The man who knows the president's fate, is not a good man. He is a chickenshit. A little, pathetic man with big ambitions and no real ability to reach them. He thinks that he's the next Lenin, that Castro is the closest thing to a God in the universe, and that he will save America, no the world, from imperialistic fascist-capitalism. He's not the brightest star in the night sky. His name is unimportant. Only what he will do today is important.

He was a marine. And a good shot. He has a rifle, and he aims at the man who stands as the leader of America. Of the free world. The smiling, successful president. The man who is everything his assassin can only ever dream of being. The trigger is pulled. A shot is heard around the world.

A man dies. Not a perfect man, nor an evil man. Just a man, who dies like all men do. But like in Sarajevo, nearly forty years before that dark November day, the death of a man creates ripples. And waves. Big ones. Tsunami-class waves. Inside of a building in New York, men are not calm. Maybe they could have been calm, have let the sorrow over the death of a man who died in the arms of his wife, unite them for a brief moment. But instead they focused on other things. That the assassin had been in the USSR. Had been a committed Marxist-Leninist. They forget the fact that he was also a pathetic little man who the KGB wouldn't have touched with a ten-foot pole. The new president accuses. Kremlin tries to seem tough, but underneath the surface, the cracks are showing. They do not know Johnson. Khrushchev and the others don't know how to react. They decide to play strong, to a show of force. The US responds in kind, tempers are hot. As John F. Kennedy is sent to Washington for his funerary service, there is a show-off. While the assassin was nearly killed by a rogue vigilante, he endured long enough to spout a whole sea of nonsense that the CIA and FBI are unable to make sense of. He is slated for execution come Christmas. But it is a Christmas that never comes.

Nobody knows who does it, who fires the first salvo, who launches the first nuke. Most suspect Curtis LeMay, who is quietly executed by strangulation at the hands of President Johnson. Or so the stories go. The President and his staff aren't in Washington when it happens, they're at the Raven Rock Mountain Complex. That's why they survive the nuclear strike on DC. The US response is quick and thorough. The Soviets have been bluffing with how many warheads and missiles they've got in their arsenal for years. A lot of European, Chinese and American cities are snuffed out by a horrible mushroom cloud and its unearthly glow. Strangely most of the missiles that hit the US strike down in the Midwest, reducing much of the land from Ohio to the Rockies to a nuclear wasteland.

The USSR, with a primary focus on the Russian heartlands, are reduced to radioactive glass. There was not nuclear parity between the two superpowers.

Famine hits the entire world which alongside the initial blasts, the residual radiation, the collapse of international trade, and the fall of stable governments in much of the world; results in a reduction of the overall world population by nearly half. Much of the US is affected too. The Johnson administration saw us safely through the initial chaos, exterminated the Dixie uprisings, kept NATO together, barely, and restored most of the USA to its former glory. It's the year 2000, Europe has been restored to functional democratic governments with the assistance of the prosperous Mediterranean Union and the technocratic Nordic Federation. With the notable exception of Airstrip One. South America has enjoyed nearly half a century without US interference in their internal politics, and much of the continent enjoys a standard of living comparable to pre-nuclear Europe. The world is returning to normal. Or at least healing.

Ah, about the operation in Iowa only? Okay.

The Midwest Territories are being slowly cleansed. And it's our job to ensure that this happens sensibly and without trouble. There are still areas that must be mapped out, checked for leftover chemical poisons that spilled over after humanity evacuated from the region. Areas of higher than normal radiation outside of the directly struck areas must be examined carefully. The Federal Bureau for the Midwest Reclamation is responsible for controlled settling of the affected area, the extermination of dangerous wildlife, and the pacification of irrational holdout areas. One of the new settlements have reported unusual sightings, Kingsburg, former state of Iowa. Outlying homesteads have gone quiet. As me and the rest of the FBMR emergency response team are understandably pensive. It's not the first time something like this has happened. Last time, it was in Ohio, around the time they were about to reintegrate the state into the Union as a full member. Some small town on the border to the former Michigan state was reporting strange sightings, missing people. We only got there when it was too late. Entire town killed by holdouts, those insane bastards who stayed behind, who didn't evacuate. Some mad cult, worshiped Kennedy's assassin. Called themselves the Oswaldians. Claimed that Kennedy was the devil, and so on. Sick. We showed them the same amount of mercy that they'd showed the people of that town. A town called Kennedy. Still gives me nightmares sometimes.

We rolled into town in the evening, and it was worse somehow. Because it was so quiet. Not a soul left around. Food on the plates in the houses when we checked them, like people had just walked off for a moment, and would come back soon. It was when we lost contact with Bravo squad, that we knew we'd walked into a trap. Someone had planned on taking us down while we were separated. Instead we all congregated to the church in the midst of the newly built town. Good vantage points for our snipers, and it was on the top of a small hill, gave us some advantage against whatever was coming for us. We didn't realise how smart it had been at that point to use the church. It just seemed logical at the time. But against what was coming for us, well, we would have been dead if we'd tried anywhere else. It was dark, as the last rays of the sun died. Dark as the pits of Hades. We had set up some floodlights to ensure we could see what we were up against.

I almost wish we hadn't, but then again, we'd be dead. They all came. The entire population of the town, but they were wrong. It was like something was moving underneath their skin. And they all looked at us with these dead grey eyes. Except for a few who were dressed in decayed uniforms back from the Second World War. They looked at us with a predatory hunger in their eyes. Some were Germans, some were our own, I think I saw one in those uniforms the Soviets used to wear back when the USSR existed. They said not a word, and did not respond to us trying to communicate with them. Instead, they lifted their arms, pointed at us, and sent the people against us. I saw Bravo Squad in there, just as dead-eyed and wrong as the others. We did what we had to do. What our orders said. If we're met by people out in the Reclamation Zone with hostility, violence, and brutality, we're to answer back with a universal greeting of 7.62x51mm ammo to the face. We fired salvo after salvo into them, but it did little to stop them in their tracks. I noticed that strikes directly to the head or through the chest where the heart is dropped our attackers dead. I gave the order to focus on headshots. And it worked beautifully. Soon their skin ceased to pulsate, and their dead eyes no longer stared into our souls. But those weirdos, the ones in the uniforms, were still out there. And they got their reinforcements before we got ours.

They were like something straight out of a Seattle monsterflick, or one of those old B-movies from before Los Angeles was nuked. They looked wrong on every conceivable level. The way they moved, the way they stood, the way they screeched. Like somebody had tried to make a human, but they'd never seen a human before and just had one vaguely and poorly described to them. Some guy from Foxtrot Squad said they looked like Nosferatus, whatever that is. Definitely meant that there was something weird out there. They attacked together with the soldier-boys, and they were something else. The soldiers used guns, which was a pain, but those... things, they practically flew to us, only stopped by the walls, which made them screech something fierce. Our bullets tore through the soldier boys, though they had the sense to hide behind covers and shot back at us. We fought all night, the strange beastly ones sometimes managing to get close enough to drag one of us out of the church. I don't want to describe or think about what they did to those unlucky ones. Poor bastards. I told the snipers to keep an eye on that. Any man dragged out gets a mercy-killing, I said. Even me.
