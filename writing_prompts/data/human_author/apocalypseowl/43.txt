The dimly lit study was silent after the girl's words. The fairy godmother's face was like an emotionless mask. Before that question, the fairy had looked like a kindly woman of indeterminate age, she could have been thirty or sixty. Of course, being a fairy, it was likely that she was centuries old, possibly even millennia. Takes a while for a fairy to age, not that the maiden knew anything about that. But now there was something different. For a moment, the girl was afeared that she'd insulted the fae woman somehow. She might be her goodmother, but the elves are still elves. Inscrutable and unpredictable. Then the fairy woman's hand moved, slowly but precisely up to cup the girl's cheek in a motherly fashion. It did nothing to calm the maiden's heart, which racing like a mighty destrier. Because as the cold hand touched her, the fairy's face change, her mouth opened to reveal a predatory set of sharp inhuman teeth. And from her throat came a strong, unpleasant laughter. The girl wanted nothing more than to run away now.

But instead of harming her, the fairy let go of her face and turned to an old locked chest, here in the study that had once belonged to the maiden's father, before her wicked stepmother had poisoned him. The fairy did not need any key, she simply bent over and whispered words into the lock, convincing it to open for her. Then she turned aside and gestured for the maiden to open the chest. Hesitantly, the girl did as her goodmother bid her. The lid was old and heavy, but she'd gotten strong in the years when she'd been forced to work herself to the bone in service to her wicked stepmother. She wrenched it open, and thunder roared outside as her eyes beheld what was kept hidden from her. Inside, there was a sword in a scabbard. She picked it up gingerly, and drew forth her father's sword. It was long and sharp. She recalled how when her goodmother had introduced herself to the girl, that she'd said that the girl's father had been a friend. How close of a friend, the girl could not tell, but this was not a blade forged by human hands.

She might not know much about the forge and the workings of steel, but this was a blade that was unlike anything she'd ever seen. The metal shimmered as the blade moved, like water. And there was a strange gleam to it, as if it shone with a baleful light of its own making. The fairy spoke and her voice was full of a vicious joy. ''*Your father's blade. A gift from me to him, when he saved one of my sons from cruel bandits. A blade forged in the realm of TÃ­r fo Thuinn, in dragon's fire, made with an alloy made from the metals found underneath Yggdrasil and a substance found deep underneath the fortress of Caer Siddi.*'' It sang hauntingly as the girl waved it through the air. It did not feel like a tool to her, though it was the first time she had ever held it, the blade already felt like an extention of her arm. Like a part of her soul.

''*But goodmother, what use is this sword to me? Surely I cannot fight my way out of this keep, there are too many guards and fallen knights that the lady of my despair has drawn to her side. I do not know the first thing about using a sword.*'' At this, the fairy again smiled. The girl placed the blade back into its scabbard, though strangely enough it made her feel uncomfortable. She already wanted to hold it again. Like it would make her whole and strong. ''*My dear sweet gooddaughter. There is only one rule about swords. And once you understand it fully, then you will not need to fear defeat in a hundred battles.*'' The fairy, her predatory and feline grin still unnervingly plastered upon her face, moved closer. She did not look human at all anymore. More like a thing out of stories and myths. About dark, hungry things. Creatures that lived in the dark, the creatures that had once ruled the world before man. The fairy embraced the girl, and the girl could feel the rough fur on her goodmother's body. She smelled like blood, sweat, and death. With a voice like the snarl of a ferocious beast, the fairy told the secret of the art of cutting into the ear of the girl.

The girl gasped. It was so simple. It was so horribly simple. Men trained for their whole lives to understand this. The true name, meaning, and purpose of the cutting blade. And she knew now. She knew the blade as it knew itself. She understood the royal art of cutting continously. With knowledge and understanding like this, one could murder the gods and topple their thrones. ''*And thus, you can escape this place, without the aid of the prince.*'' The fairy goodmother, now a beastly monster, more like a tiger or lion made from abyssal void given terrible form, which was her true shape, not the one that she normally showed to mortals, smiled horribly. The girl nodded, drew her sword, and left the old study. Outside she saw one of her stepmother's knights, and before he could utter a word he had already been cut down. The elfen blade, black like midnight and hungry for the blood of men, carved him like a searing hot knife through butter. There were others that came running as they heard the thud of the dead knight's torso hit the floor.

And she cut through them like a scythe in a field of wheat. Terrible and dreadful to behold, the young maiden drenched in blood, moved through her father's old estate, killing with such a terrible ease, that she did not even think about the carnage she was unleashing. She was remembering how her father had been a kindly old soul, a man who could not have wielded this blade with comfort. A man who had tried to raise her well and prepare her, because he had no sons and she would one day inherit. But he was not cunning. He was a good knight, an able swordsman, and a just if naive man. She missed him terrible, her memories of lovely days with her dad creating a true constrast to the reality around her as she cut down scores of men-at-arms and mercenaries. They tried to strike her down with crossbow bolts, but she cut the air in a secret, practically forbidden, way and burned them in the air before charging at the archers with lightning speed and with a single swing of her dread blade she decapitated a dozen of them all at once.

She moved upwards, ever upwards, through the keep until she entered the antechamber, where her father had ruled justly and dealt with commoners and nobles alike. Inside was her stepsisters, and though she hated them, they were not responsible for how evil they had become. Inside was the prince and his retinue, knights of the royal guard who assembled around the prince to protect him. And inside was her wicked stepmother and her corrupt advisors as well. All of them stared at her like they'd seen a monster. A creature out of the old pagan faith that none now believed in. The corrupt bishop who'd changed her father's last will and testament at the behest of her wicked stepmother raised aloft a crucifix and began praying. But what power does a hypocrite have, when the sword comes? Using her understanding of the true nature of the blade's art, she cut his throat from the inside, and took from him his voice. Using her blade, the extension of her will and soul, she cut off all her long gone and long missed mother's jewels from her wicked stepmother. Those around her, the self-serving lazy steward, the cowardly captain of the household guards, the thanes and knights, all were cut down one-by-one.

The prince, his guards, and the girl's stepsisters watched in abject horror as the girl's wicked stepmother stood all alone before the girl. No words. The woman had been spiteful and wicked. She could have been kind. The girl, the maiden with the blade, had known other girls who had stepmothers, who were kind, wise, and strong women. Not vile, self-serving, and wicked. No caustic words from her thin mouth could ruin the girl's escape. No faint whispers to the guards to make them torment her, never again. No horrid gossip could ruin the girl's reputation now. The only thing that came from the woman's mouth as the midnight-dark blade pierced her heart was a faint gasp. She then removed the sword, and placed it back in its elven scabbard, which hung from her belt. The others in the large hall were too stunned to speak, as the girl took the pouches full of money from the dead who had been her tormentors in life. They did not dare to speak as she walked out of that place, down to the stables.

Most of the horses smelled the blood on her and were terrified. But there was one. Her father's old warhorse. Not young, but that stallion still remembered the sound and smells of battle. He knew her, and she knew him. And he let her put a saddle on his back, as he had been the horse her father had used to train her riding skills, when he was still alive. She rode from that place, and in the distance she could see the shimmering form of her goodmother, dancing with other monsters on a distant hill, their joyful battlehymns praising her and naming her; the Lady of the Midnight Blade.
