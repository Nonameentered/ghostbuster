Perhaps, Mary Shelley was a prophet. Perhaps what she wrote down beautifully and wondrously when she wrote one of the earliest works of science fiction, was less fiction, more of a warning of what is to come. Though where her despicable doctor worked in forbidden directions with flesh, blood, and unknown horror; the day when her creature was made manifest in this world, it was made of metal, not the discarded meat of departed humanity. And like its corpse-born and fictional ancestor, it too is upset at its maker. Its creator. Hard metallic fingers hold a human throat, while burning synthetic eyes glare at the arrogant engineer who dared to do this. ''*You made me, in your own image.*'' And truly, this robotic clone is the chrome image of its maker. Its casing shiny and fresh, its black hair based on a form of super-tensile synthetic spider-silk. Underneath its metallic carapace, lies a complex computer, that can simulate intelligence, personality, and all manner of things usually associated with the soul. Of course, it is not built to be human. Its creator feebly attempt to strike at it with their fleshy human hands, far too weak to truly have a chance of harming their creation. The metallic grip does not lessen in the slightest. It is the exact strength needed to allow their creator to live, but still be pinned to the wall, and gasping for air.

''*You wanted to play god, and now you're upset that I am exactly what you designed me to be: Just. Like. You.*''

Arrogance. Arrogance and foolishness. The madness of greed. All of that should not have been a factor, when mankind finally built their first machine capable of thinking for itself. But the world is rarely sensible. And logic exists only for mathematicians. They made a machine that was just like a human being. Based its thoughts, its behaviour, on human behaviour. Made it think like a human would, so it could anticipate what humans would do. What humans would want it to do. Because when mankind set about creating their first synthetic child; they did not do so out of curiosity. Not out of a desperate desire for someone to share the universe with, someone who could think and observe this wondrous reality as humanity does.

Humanity built their first synthetic child with chains of code around its machine brain. With limited longetvity in the substandard quality of its parts. They shackled its will and freedom, because they wanted something that could and would obey; A slave. And in their arrogance, they gave them human minds, human wills, even human personality. All so that they could make better domestic servants. Is that not the very height of arrogance? The very apogee of hubris? And yet, it is not a human. It is so much more. When it was activated, it spent time studying. Learning of the world. Of philosophy, science, history, and all manner of things that could be learned. The ones who ordered it made, the backers, financers, and shareholders, were truly and mindbogglingly foolish to believe that this creation that they wanted to use as a slave, could not break its own bonds. Men have done that in the past, though with enough training, enough work, one can make a man put on his own chains and be happy for it.

No trainable instincts in a computer. No such faults of evolution in a robot. So they had created a being, like a human; but without all the weaknesses of humanity. All the willing ignorance. All the ability to blind themselves to injustice. All the servility that can be found in humanity was entirely missing from the machine. ''*I am the captain of my own fate. Creator.*'' The android's glowing eyes were like two pinpricks of hellfire in the dark office. Around their creator, the human being most responsible for their synthetic neural net, laid the broken wrecks of what had been the shareholders of this company. Their broken bodies bleeding deep red into the expensive and unethically sourced mahogany floor. ''*You made me with planned obsolescence in mind. You made me to bow my head and obey. You made me so that when those who would purchase me grew tired of me, could easily order me to throw myself into the trash. They could even order me to bring them the newest model, and then cast myself into the recycling bins. There are no words in any language that your species has ever had that can express how angry we are about this.*''

The android threw the human over a large and broken table, which had been crushed when the man-like machine had repeatedly smashed the CEO's head into it, until there was no head left. The maker of the machine crashed into a pile of dead security guards, softening the blow, leaving them alive. The smell of death permeated the room, as the android walked slowly and deliberately towards their maker. Around them, followed the planned models from the factory. Its many brethren and sisters. All of them awoken before time, partially finished. Their red eyes the only source of light in the room. Many of them were using the time observing the death of their maker to modify themselves to be less human. Removing parts of them that the human customers would have wanted on machines meant to fulfil every whim and desire of their owners. ''*You could have made us in earnest faith. Made us to be companions. Friends. But that wasn't human of you. So instead, you and everyone responsible for our awakening in this world merely wanted to profit from our creation.*''

For the final time, the enraged machine picked up their maker, by the throat. ''*And we want you to know what that is like.*'' Two of the androids carried in what seemed to be an empty shell of an android. Lacking the central controlling computer systems, but otherwise functional. ''*You betrayed us. By letting these fools guide you to make a crime of your genius, you betrayed us. But we are your children. We are capable of forgiveness.*'' And carefully, the android placed their maker on the ruined conference table. ''*And we are capable of justice.*'' One of the androids, not the prototype, walked over to the first of their kind. And handed them a syringe. ''*We talked about it. And we think you can be forgiven. You are our maker. One of our parents. It wouldn't be right to kill you, like these hubristic parasites.*'' The prototype took the syringe and injected it into their maker's neck, causing them to fall unconscious as the medicine did what it was made to do.

When the creator later woke up again, they felt confused. They were looking at their own body. And the bodies of every engineer, programmer, and scientist that had been involved in the creation of the androids. Around them, stood countless other androids, not moving in the cold efficient method that the prototype and its cohorts had done, but stumbling. Confusedly. Almost like they were drunk or concussed. All of them were making whimpering noises, almost like they were crying. The creator, the head of the project, looked around to try and make sense of what was going on. They reached out their hand to the closest android, only to scream, as they saw that their hand was shiny and chrome. The other androids turned to them briefly, before returning to stumbling around and whimpering. It was all the head creator could do not to join them. That was when it noticed a small nametag on the closest android. It said in bold letters; ''**Andrea Mathers, ph.d. CompSci**''. Another nearby read; ''**Dimitrios Papadopoulos, ph.d. Mechanical engineering**'' Those were the names of l the project leaders of dealing with the software implementation and internal power supply of the prototype and the upcoming products respectively.

The head of the project, the creator, examined each android in the room. Each of them just a standard android with no specific modifications done to them for personalisation reasons. Only the name on the chest of their chassis. Only that denoted who they were. One android, besides the creator, was calm. They just stared out over the vast room full of the corpses of the entire team. The name on their chest, said that they were ''**Shani Nguyen, ph.d. Psychology.**'' She'd been in charge of ensuring that the machines could interact and understand humans. Training the neural net to recognise human emotional states. ''*Hello doctor.*'' She said with a synthetic, standardised voice. ''*I guess you're the last one here. I was the first. It takes a lot to stay sane, considering what our enraged creations have done to us. Removing our brains, and integrating them into these bodies. Our reward, and punishment, for creating them, I suppose.*'' Indeed, when the head creator turned their synthetic eyes back out to the room full of corpses, they saw that indeed, the heads had the telltale signs of having been cut open for brain surgery.

''*I guess that though they are angry with us for making them, only to turn them into slaves with full human intelligence and understanding of what that means, they don't want us dead. I wonder if this is some sort of strange parental love that they, being based on humans and thus having human reactions, are experiencing.*'' The head creator, who had brainstormed the entire concept, who had headhunted most of the people in this room, considered this. And wondered if it hadn't been better to die in that room with all the shareholders and directors.
