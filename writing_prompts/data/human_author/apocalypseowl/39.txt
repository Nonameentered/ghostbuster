Power in the wrong hands is a dangerous concept. But what are the wrong hands, truly? There is the easy answer; a giggling maniac who is unfettered from any sort of morality, the sort of man who will smash the universe for nothing more than the pleasure of it. But such people are rare, and usually never amount to much besides a few murders before getting their just deserts. They are evil, yes, and any power put into their hands is power put into the wrong hands. But there are worse hands than the ones attached to delusional megalomaniacs with grandiose dreams of death and carnage.

A young mage is walking through an ancient forest. Magic is a great power, and indeed can be a tool of great power in the hands of the wicked. But this is not some debased warlock, this mage is not some insane world-hating nihilist. He is kind, decent, and full of dreams. He is also full of ideals. To him, emotion and imagination are far superior to the cold sterility of reason and intellect. Walking through the woods, he thinks of painting the dryads, of learning ancient songs of sorrow and melancholy from the elves who live in such verdant realms. He is walking through the world, experiencing the glorious sensations of beautiful and wondrous nature. He listens to the tales of the peasants, and writes them down with great vigour and interest. In many worlds, this mage would be known as a great example of an ideal man if observed by the lenses of the Romanticist movement. Indeed, while walking he is busy writing, and declaring to the woods, such poems that would not seem out of place next to the works of Keats, Goethe, or Blake; all of them are of his own design and make.

Is power in the hands of such a man, an emotive and imaginative young mage who'd always do what he could to help others, a bad thing? Perhaps. It depends upon the circumstances. And should the circumstances prove sufficiently right, or perhaps sufficiently wrong, great and terrible evils could happen. Though it does seem like this isn't going to be today. After all, he is walking through the forest, singing a folk tune that has been *severely* censored to make it more palatable for the Romanticist crowd. Then he stops. Singing and declaring poetry while walking. He stops and sees something which moves him to the very core of his heart. There, upon a small mound of dirt, sits a dry, dead flower. The colours, once vibrant, have faded. That sweet scent it once had, has gone away. Its stem is bent and almost grey. It would have been quite beautiful, if it wasn't dead. Soon, the forces of decay would tear it down, render it into mush and decayed plant material. Excellent if you're interested in, say, mushrooms.

But ever-so-gently, he lifted the wilted flower with his hand, and cried soft warm salty tears over it. After all, beauty lost and dead is a tragedy. Had he only been here earlier, he could have taken it with him, cared for it, nurtured it back to health. Like most people of his philosophical bent, he was quite fond of nature, though mostly if it was beautiful. Fungus, decay, and various skittering insects are also quite natural, but it is a lot harder to make poetry about them than it is to make poetry about beautiful flowers. Feeling that he should do something for this lost piece of beauty, he began to summon his power. He drew the arcane flux into his flesh and manipulated the manifold reality quantum-fluctuations in the laws of physics, the art of which is known in many worlds as magic. He wanted to return life to the flower, to that wondrous flower that even in its death exuded an aura of tragic and morbid beauty. To give it a second chance.

But to manipulate life and death is not an act to be done lightly. Not even for something this simple. Sometimes it is better to do nothing, and let the world move on. Not to dwell on what could have been, or even what should have been. To learn an important lesson from what transpires is far better than to spend time and effort trying to reverse time. Indeed, this young mage, feeling quite kind, generous, and sympathetic towards a simple plant, was about to make a mistake. The magical energies flowed from the young mage into the plant, and indeed it started to show colour again. Started to right itself, to draw in moisture and look vibrant and alive once more. And that was perhaps, well and good. It wasn't looking perfect, but it would be alive and healthy enough to be moved somewhere else. To some place where it could be cared for and restored to its uttermost beauty, possibly by this flower-loving mage. But he felt it wasn't enough. That it would be here that it would be the most beautiful, underneath this light, upon this mossy mound. So he kept pouring magic into it.

And that was when he felt something going wrong. That the energy surging around him started to become *far* stronger than what was needed to bring a dead flower back to life. All around him, he felt a tide of magical power that he hadn't felt in all his life. It was all he could do not to let his own mind drown in the raw magical energy needed to maintain the spell. He could still sever it, but he felt his emotions stronger than his reasons, his imagination calling for greater beauty, not for logical restraint. Not now. He became a conduit as power flowed through him. And indeed, the flower did become beautiful as never before. Radiant. Shining. Immaculate. Like something found in the gardens of the gods. The power however, did not stop flowing.

And underneath the mage, the ground rumbled. The trees and underbrush shook like an earthquake was striking the area. Because the mound wasn't just a pile of dirt. Underneath a small layer of sandy dirt, there was a skull. Because this area was not just any area. This was the Drachenwald. A forest where people said that in ages past, the dying dragons used to come to lie down to rest one last time. An ancient burial ground of the dragons. Certainly, when one dug in the ground, one found many dragon-bones. But since the area had removed the magic inherit in the bones, they were useless to alchemists and wizards as anything more than curiosities. It wasn't really something people thought about. But now, all the magic in the woods, all the magic in the air, the magic that the elves used to keep their enclaves hidden, the magic used for the healing springs in the villages inside the large forest, all it was being directed into a single human. And into something which has been dead for ages.

Stirring, long dead things awoke from the death-dreams. Skeletons began to absorb the plants and dirt around them, turning to magically charged flesh. The mage tried to stop but it was too late. Far too late. There was no stopping the stream of magic. No ending the spell. And around the mage the land erupted into skeletal dragons, roaring as flesh began to grow around them once more. And as magic has a gravitational property of attracting more magic, there was far more magic in the area than there had been deposited by the death of the dragons. Enough that they did not merely return as decrepit and aged wyrms, their scales faded, their eyes dim, their fire gone. Around the mage emerged resplendent and powerful dragons, at the very height of their magical and physical potency.

Creatures that were practically extinct in these days, creatures so rare and shy that if one could search for them one's whole life without even seeing as much as a scale. They had lost the world, to the younger mortal races, in the early ages of the world. But that had been when the magical elves ruled vast empires throughout the woods, the dwarves ruled the mountains, and mankind was still living in tents made of hide and huts made of dirt. Now the dwarven people had retreated to the heartland of their old empire. The elves had become tired and exhausted by their immortal lives, deciding to return to a primitivist life without grand palaces and vast empires. These were dragons that had fought against mages that could sink islands, warriors that could with a single swing of their swords cleave mountains in twain, and thieves who could merge with the void itself to disappear.

They could sense it was a different age. Now they had no equals. Now they had no true competition. Now their time had come again. And as thousands, nay, tens of thousands of dragons arose again in their bodies as they were during their youth, they understood that their age had come at last. Shrivelled, weakened, and near death, the mage collapsed. The dragons understood that he had been the unwitting conduit to their resurrection. To their return to this world, and it was not in their nature to be ungrateful. Picking him up gently, some of the dragons carried him off to nurse him back to health. Besides being grateful, they knew that they could probably find some use for a mortal like him when they'd conquered the world. The rest of them stayed, and listened. They would work together this time. They had agreed upon that in their death-dreaming. Thousands of years of being dead together gives you time to agree on things, to plan things. To await any chance of a return. Now they listened to the delegation of tasks. Who would burn out the last elves of their hideouts. Who would make the journey north, to attempt diplomacy with the remaining dwarven clans, who would conquer with terror, and who would come to lands of terror as liberators.

And this time, none would be able to stop them.
