Most of the aliens that came, lost what little they had left of their many cultures, integrated, and became for all intents and purposes besides the purely biological, human. Perhaps if they had had a single overarching culture for each race, they could have rallied, but since that isn't realistic and no species has only a single culture, besides those constantly on the warpath, most of the refugees were just hundreds if not thousands of different cultures that couldn't compete against the humans. Not that they didn't influence humanity, but it was always part of one alien culture becoming part of a human culture, not the alien culture surviving or thriving. Sure, one sees a lot of Dhellgahn ring-totems in Peru, and Australia has more Srulic-hoverbike races than any other nation. One cannot go on vacation in the former Russian nations without seeing something alien. Of special note are the V'gavn grown crystal meditation gardens in the Republic of Sakha, and only in the Ural Republic has the alien Opgyri crops taken root and become a local staple(*looks like a yam made of latex, tastes like potatoes soaked in orange juice with lots of paprika; an acquired taste*). But these are mere appendages. Alien influences, on a mostly human culture.

The last refugees came aboard a single ship, consisting of a single survivor with some ten thousand embryos in stasis. After that, silence. Before, mankind had decided to keep a low profile, staying inside of our star-system for now. But as the decades passed, people became more and more interested in seeing just what had happened. So a ship was sent out. A single ship, based on hundreds of different designs from different races. It was a lot more efficient than any ship ever made before first contact; since a lot of species had their own modifications to ship design making their FTL-ships more efficient, so putting them all together made a *very* efficient ship indeed. The ship was crewed by humans, but as that term has, to everyone but the most extreme xenophobes, become a fluid term, there were a lot of bio-diversity onboard. A few older nerds were quite giddy at seeing their dreams of a Star Trek-like mankind come to fruition, more or less, with many aliens onboard a single ship.

Their report was fairly bleak. Total war cannot be sustained indefinitely. As more and more is thrown into the carnage, the inferno of war, the bigger the flames become, the more they consume. The ship reported dead worlds, glassed worlds, millions of ruined ships floating in space, worlds where society had regressed to practically feudal levels. And worlds where experimental weaponry had done unspeakable things. It was clear, the war that had consumed the galaxy, the war that all those refugees had fled from, had finally ended. No victors could reasonably be had. All that was left, was a lot of space into which mankind could expand. And there were many worlds which had survivors, who needed relief. Something that Earth and mankind could provide.

That's how a galactic federation starts. Relief ships full of resources, technology, replicators, medical professionals, and other highly sought items, began arriving on dying worlds. What a masterstroke of diplomacy. Setting up emergency provisional mandates on countless planets, rebuilding, offering assistance, educating, and in some cases even overthrowing the tyrannical remnants of the old warlord regimes. It all came together, and soon the few remaining worlds that still had some manner of technology and FTL-tech, began hearing rumours of a Federation. A nation that was helping the wounded, an empire based on decent values, that was coming to help. They begged, and helped, and soon enough, their worlds became as they were before the war. Verdant, habitable paradises. Them signing over their independence to the humans, no matter what shape they were, was inevitable. Was it planned? No. Was it something we embraced? Yes.

Of course, these are just the words of an old man, enjoying his retirement. I am not the President of the Federation anymore. But I still remember day when our decaying ship landed, and how the locals embraced us. Do you know that it was me on that one famous picture, crying as a local woman hugged me. ''Alien children embraced by the New Zealanders.'' Brings me back even thinking about it. It was the first time I felt safe ever since I was sent away. I still remember being raised by kindly humans. I still remember forgetting my native language, and speaking like a man, walking like a man, beginning to even think like one. Whether that was right or not, well, I suppose we'll never know. But we were embraced by humanity, and then infected by it. Of course, we had an easier time of it than most, we were very cute, after all.
