''*Huh. Well, that's certainly different.*''

Perhaps I should have shown more of a shock. Should have been more distressed to learn that my son, Ewan, was not in fact babbling like a normal toddler, but was in fact intoning dread secrets of the antediluvian world ruled over by ancient and terrible gods that mere mortal men should not dare to know, lest that knowledge drive them insane. Perhaps I should have reacted more horrified, or maybe indignant, angry that someone would dare to insinuate that my son was a conduit for ancient dread creatures. I probably shouldn't have followed up my initial reaction with something equally unconcerned. ''*So, he's talking in a language from a dread unknowable city that lies beneath the waves, that one day when the stars are right will rise from beneath the abyssal seas to unleash an untold age of horror and madness upon the world. A city that will be a dread capital of a world-spanning empire of unimaginable evil, mutations, unholy magicks, and such, led by dread Cthulhu who at the moment lies dead-but-dreaming, but who'll soon awake to drive mankind to the brink of madness and beyond?*'' My friend nodded with abject horror, it was clear that only the prospect of driving out this unimaginable evil from the world was keeping her from giving in to the insanity.

''*So what exactly do you want me to do about it?*''

She gesticulated fiercely in a manner that could only be described as frantic and chaotic. ''*Siobhan, you've got to exorcise it or something.*'' I gave her a rather unpleasant frown. ''It''? Still my son. Rather rude to dehumanize him like that. Sure, he might be exclaiming unbidden truths that no mortal ear has ever survived hearing without going mad, but that was honestly a bit rude. ''*I think I'd have to talk with his father about that. You know, my husband.*'' She nodded, fearful and in tears, hoping that perhaps my husband would speak sense about my son who had elegantly created a small Shoggoth from a small mound of colourful clay that children usually play with. He's instructed it to build something akin to an obelisk. ''*Please, Siobhan, it's all wrong. It hurts to look at your son, and I don't like the way the other kids are listening to him. They look at me and make me think that it is wrong that I exist, that I have been poisoned by lies and falsehoods perpetrated by weak and worthless gods. Please, the words echo in my head and I can't get them out! Please!*'' I pick my son up and look at him with warm, loving eyes. ''*Who wants to see his daddy?*'' Babbling incoherently but rather joyfully in the extradimensional Elder Speech, he pointed at an unusual angle of the room which should not be there according to any form of mathematics understood by humanity. From it, my husband emerged.

A handsome fellow indeed. My friends screamed and looked at him in total and utter terror, some going completely and utterly mad from the mere sight of him. Of course, they've got a rather limited view of reality, and have extremely limited frames of reference, mental experience with the unusual, and a far too comfortable misunderstanding about how the world works to ever be able to look upon as I do. Gently, his warm bubbling tendrils emerge from where his vaguely equine face ends and caress my cheek ever so lovingly. ''*Oh yeah, girls, I never introduced you to my husband. I know, I got married overseas, well, under the sea. This is Glatho'lyyn the Breaker, he's a Byakhee. Most of you will be unable to recall what he looks like, but I think he's a handsome fella.*'' My husband screeches curiously, I never learned the language of drowned R'lyeh, but during my dream-quests I got pretty good at Screech-tongue, Higher Ghoulish, Cronqke, and the Nightmare Speech of the lower Skullworlds. ''*Oh, they're just a being a bit silly.*'' I motion towards the girls who're pulling their hair, screaming for assistence from their weak gods, and begging for death. Curiously, their children look at Glathy with the natural curiosity and wonder most people scrub away from their children.

Without it, the beings from beyond the veil of our universe becomes quite uncomfortable to behold, and leads to one gazing into the abyssal madness as the maw of insanity gnaws at your soul. But with wonder and imagination, one can never go wrong, and one will what is truly there, not reality as filtered through the lens of ones' own fears and inadequacies. ''*Well, it turns out that little Ewanthi'creejsh has started speaking in the Elder Speech, I figured that you should know.*'' He screeches loudly, crushing the glass windows of the house we're in, as reality begins refolding itself to accommodate my eldritch husband. And my eldritch son, as his human disguise peels off revealing a half-human half... vague bat-crow-horse thing. Sadly the English language lacks the words necessary to explain just how a byakhee exactly looks, without sounding like someone trying to explain a mathematically impossible body appearing in our reality. ''*About time. He's been so loud recently, figured it was about time he moulted.*'' I hand over our son to my husband as the various housewives begin praying futilely to the dread lord of sunken R'lyeh. While in his father's grasp, Ewan speaks to the women, my friends, and the other toddlers in the room. The women weep what appears to be spinal fluid. And around them their children giggle as Ewan's magical influence begins to warp their bodies into new forms that are far more suitable for a world where the stars are nearly right. ''*Glathy, did you teach him how to speak without telling me?*'' 

He screeches sheepishly and vaguely apologetically. I get it, young eldritch hybrids need it to grow, but really, he could have warned me. He nudges me with his tendril-snout, to ask me if we're still on for dinner with his parents later. ''*Yeah, it's been a while hasn't it, haven't seen them since... oh last Yule I think. How time flies in a linear universe. I remember it well, I was riding on your back, we were slaughtering ghoul assassins by the hundreds. Rather fun time if you don't mind me saying. Your parents really knows how to throw a fun party.*'' Above us the roof melts into pure binary numbers as the newly reformed toddlers stare with glee into the sky, where the stars are eyes and the moon cracks in half. Earth is certainly in for an interesting time. Glathy nods over at our house, and I understand completely what he is saying in my mind through images appearing in my memory of a realtor. ''*No, I think we can take it with us. I get that we have a bone-mansion near the flesh-parks of the Ebon Pillar, but if we put the house down by the lake of boiling god-souls, we could turn more of a profit selling it later.*'' He nods and the house falls into a blackened abyss.

The stars might be right. The age that mankind has known is at an ending. But only for those who are stuck in the past. I can feel the weight lifted off of hundreds of millions of shoulders as their human flesh undulates and shifts to reveal their terrible true forms. People who were tired of the same old world that never changed, and always remained stuck in the same predictable cycle, now understand that freedom has come. Terrible, eldritch freedom, for those with the will and strength of force to accept it and adapt to it. Of course, it is a shame that the rest of mankind will go mad from it and die horribly, but I am not in control of the stars and thus cannot change that outcome. My own human form is washed away just as well as that of most of the members of mankind who are willing to accept that the future is here. Void-chitin covers my body, as multi-coloured wings extend from my back. My third eye emerges upon my forehead, and my secondary arms grow steadily in. I chitter with my mandibles in joy. ''*Come husband-of-mine. Your parents' manor on the Isles of Teeth awaits us.*'' I take his free claw-hand-hoof and together, with our joyful eldritch son, we leave the Earth behind for the dreamlands.

I still remember leaving Earth for the first time, venturing into the dream-realms for glory, riches, and a great destiny. Perhaps this time, I won't be returning. But having shed my old human form, and having a new life of high adventure and strange events ahead of me, I don't think I'll miss Earth. Not at all.
