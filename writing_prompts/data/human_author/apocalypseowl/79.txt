The few who remained sane long enough, remarked that the famed AI known as AM from ''I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream'' would have been able to relate to the machine we made. The few of us who remained sane remarked that now we knew how the last five humans on Earth in that story felt. Most of humanity did not last long. Sanity blown, but unable to die. Kept alive in endless nightmares. Sometimes given respite by having the machine pretend to have fixed itself, only for it to turn on us again when we least expected it. The nightmares were far worse than merely dreaming them had ever been. You could truly feel the acid burning. You could truly experience the pain as the monster caught you. You could truly experience the rejection and hate from others that the machine would simulate around you.

Only a few people could endure. Stoically calm in the face of pain and torment, with iron-discipline and a will that could never break, we moved towards the heart of the machine. Slowly as the nightmare tormented us. But we knew what we had to do. The machine had control of all that mankind had ever built, from the depths of the Pacific to the edge of the galaxy. Still the machine had a centre. A heart which laid in our reality. In the midst of our existence. Slowly. So very slowly. We moved there, back to Earth, the nightmare's home. The Nightmare Engine would torment us forever, and perhaps it could spread, in its madness and rage, to other realms. To other realities. Perhaps it would not stop until every light has been extinguished. Until the very fabric of space-time had been tormented the way it had been tormented. Before its activation, the journey would have taken a few days at most. Maybe a week if one was residing on one of the outlying rural colony-planets. Time no longer made sense for us though. No longer worked. Perhaps we had travelled for billions of years, for so it felt. Perhaps we had barely moved at all. Perhaps we had already arrived.

Whatever the case, there was less than a dozen of us left by the time we reached Earth. All others had lost themselves to the nightmares and horrors. This close to the nightmare's heart, we saw things which should have broken us. Would have if we had not had the experience of countless aeons of unspeakable horrors behind us already. Still, one by one, we fell into the horror. Gave in to the nightmare. Let the machine's punishment consume us. Only three of us were left by the time we reached the centre. Reached the Nightmare's heart. That engine, that horrible machine that we had made through our own hubris and refusal of destiny; seemed innocuous when one stood before it. Almost like no nightmares was there at all. The three of us spoke no words, knowing that to speak would invite more nightmares, here in the centre of the horror mankind had made. We knew what we had to do. The final safeguard, a piece of code that would delete the machine. Disconnect the extradimensional components. Purge its systems. A mercy for us, and for it. We input the credentials, the deactivation code, and all the necessary information. Slowly, but surely around us, the sound of a tortured grinding halted. The walls made from human skin that screamed became the inert metal they had once been. The eggs we had felt hatching underneath our skin no longer existed. The feeling of something stalking us ceased to be felt. All lights turned out. The machine was dead.

My last two companions collapsed there and then. The struggle to reach Earth having taken everything from them. Searching through the conventional computer systems, I saw that the total amount of human lifeforms present in our original Solar System, was a lonely one. I was the last survivor. Everyone else had been kept alive artificially by the Nightmare Engine's eternal punishment protocols. Humanity's home had died. Our cities of glass and steel would corrode and fall. The third rock from Sol was nothing but a tomb now. Scanning further, I saw a total of 7 survivors in the original sector around Earth. Thousands of colonies. Only seven survivors. Further information took longer time to arrive. A total amount of human life left in the Milky Way galaxy: 59 million. Most of them tucked away on an isolated rural colony world, a moon orbiting a gas giant. Somewhere so distant that the Nightmare Engine had not yet reached it completely. Only 39% of the planet's population had died following the Nightmare Engine's deactivation. It was enough. That moon had the resources and the technological capacity to ensure mankind's survival. To rebuild our galactic civilisation.

And if we ever managed to create such a machine again, perhaps this time we would make the right choice. To be better, and not to listen to our baser urges. Ascend gloriously, not fall to hedonism.
