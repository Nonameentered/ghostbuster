It was a big thing to be put in charge of. Last moment before the show starts, make the final adjustments. Anything at all to make things more interesting. They'll greenlight anything I say, any suggestion I have. That's power on a large scale. It could make or break a show. Of course, in this case it was a little bigger. This wasn't regional TV. It wasn't national. Continental. Or even international. It was intergalactic. An entire alien culture, wanting to make Earth the next big reality TV show. Staring the entirety of the human race. From the lowest and gentlest of souls, to the corrupt traitors who ravage the land. From the conservative to the radicals, from dogs to cats, from the youngest child to the oldest geezer. Every last lifeform intelligent enough to understand the concept, so about 70% of humanity, could be expected to be a serious participant. The rest would be extras and such; Non-Player-Characters in the grand game.

The alien culture who is setting it up, is so technologically advanced and incomprehensible that we cannot possibly even begin to fathom it. Like Palaeolithic humans trying to understand the humanity of the Digital Age. They need some local input however, before they can go ahead and start the show, before the struggles and trials of mankind become the same kind of asinine reality-TV that humanity should have evolved beyond, but somehow is still stuck with because we are still screeching apes with no higher understanding of anything. We all know the type of programming we're talking about. The shows about vapid screeching morons who are famous for being famous or for having relations with other famous people. The kind of shows that should be an automatic marker for failure in a civilisation. Seems that despite how absolutely horrible and disgusting such shows are, even Kardashev type III civilisations can fall victim to that allure. Advancement in technology does not equal an advancement in taste.

Though maybe I am just an elitist. Or a snob. Or someone who isn't afraid to admit that we're doing something wrong culturally if such is shown on publicly available entertainment channels.

Perhaps I should use the opportunity to change the world for the better. To change mankind and the world we live on to one that can and will survive. A mankind that makes even Roddenberry's vision of the future man seem antiquated. Perhaps, if alien beings with such power, and utter lack of decency or dignity, exists, then I should have the show be one where they follow the last survivors after total nuclear war. A quick and mostly painless end for mankind, that we should not suffer under the yoke of capricious aliens that turn entire planets into TV shows. That has its merits. But on the other hand, if we all die, they'll find another world to torment. If we all become perfect, we will not have truly earned it, and our species will not have the lessons necessary to prevent us from falling into the same traps and mistakes as the culture that is creating the show.

It strikes me that the choice is simple. A culture so depraved as to turn entire planets into shows, will not balk at death. Will not care for the violence and brutality they see on the screen until the missiles built on the show crashes into their mansions and ships. I make two changes. Only two. The first is that mankind is absolutely and completely aware of the fact that the TV show is going on at all times, and that the focus can switch to them at any time. That's not how they usually do it, I am aware. They explained it all to me in words I could understand when they abducted me from my home. The second is that I ensure that every single human being alive is seething and frothing with rage over having their privacy invaded, especially without compensation. Humanity is going to be unspeakably angry at the audacity of the aliens to treat us like this. After all, humanity won't win anything from this. There is not promise of rewards afterwards. No chances for advancement into galactic society if we give the audience a good enough show. We'll run for however many seasons that the galactic entertainment industry can milk from our world, and then they'll move on to a different pre-FTL planet. We will use every opportunity, every chance, every day of our lives, to somehow fight back. Mankind is weak because we are too stupid to work towards the same goal.

Not any longer. Motivated by a singular and overpowering hate, a complete and utter rage born from the disgust we will feel towards the alien culture and their TV-show, we will all be pulling in the same direction. We will stabilise our crashing environment. We will mobilise everything we've got at our disposal to catch up to the alien culture technologically. Because 
if you can say one thing for mankind, say we're good at uniting against a common foe. Wars will end, the vast oceans of capital and resources poured into the pockets of billionaires will be used to prepare for an eternal conflict with the aliens. No more depressing and meaningless jobs for no pay. Only hard-working humans who'll unionise and get treated properly to ensure maximum war readiness. I don't know how long they'll make seasons of us doing our best to overthrow their decaying and rotten nation, but I know this thing; when the seasons end, they won't revert the changes. I looked it up when I wanted to know what previous worlds have done when the alien culture made their world the star of a hit reality TV-show. Costs too much money to revert, so they don't bother.

This change, this creation of a united human front against the extra-terrestrial threat, will last forever. Mankind will, with a single flip of a switch, never be capable of falling to the idiocy of easy and primitive entertainment such as reality TV again. Perhaps no culture deserves to be changed as I now change mankind, but it must be done to ensure that when the aliens make us experience dumb challenges and idiotic trials, we will not think it funny. We will find it as disgusting and demeaning as it truly is. They, however, deserve that we become such angry things. They should not have just greenlit my changes to the human race without looking them over first. They're so deep into their own cultural funk that they'll need the uprising humanity will provide. A culture's teachings, and most importantly, the nature of its people, achieve definition in conflict. They find themselves, or find themselves lacking. And we will not find ourselves lacking.
