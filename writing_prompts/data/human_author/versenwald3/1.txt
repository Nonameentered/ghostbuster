Dragon Boy's heart was beating loudly in his chest. Best to get this over as quickly as possible.  Pushing down on the door handle, he opened the door and entered the office.

Sitting behind the desk was his boss of the last five years.

*Five years*, he thought grimly to himself. *Five years, and this is still where I'm at.*

"So," Starbright cleared his throat. "What did you want to talk with me about?"

"It's almost time for year-end review," Dragon Boy said.

"Yes, I'm quite aware of that."

*He's got to have at least an inkling of what I want to talk about.* Dragon Boy set his jaw and asked the question. "I wanted to ask about getting promoted."

The crease on Starbright's forehead deepened. "Well, I hate to say it, but it's not looking likely this year. There's only so much funding for full-time hero positions, and the League of Heroes is actually slated to lose funding due to Spitfire's publicity stunt this year. We might actually have to demote some heroes to sidekick for the next fiscal year, forget about promotions."

"Oh," Dragon Boy was at a loss for words. *Five years, and still a sidekick. Five years, and still no closer to being a full-time superhero*. He clutched the email printout in his hands, willing himself to say something.

"In that case, I wanted to discuss leaving the League of Heroes," he said.

Starbright sighed, long and loud. "I had a feeling you would say that. I completely understand. Honestly, if I were you, I'd do the exact same thing. Where were you thinking? The Vigilante Squad? The Wonder Champions?"

"Actually, I'm considering leaving hero work altogether," Dragon Boy demurred.

"Not a bad idea, kid. All the hero orgs are feeling the financial crunch. The public's lost trust in us, and it might take a while for corporations to start funding us again. You could go into bodyguarding, or take up a nice cushy security post."

Starbright narrowed his eyes, noticing the piece of paper in Dragon Boy's hands. "What's that? Have you already got an offer in hand?"

Without a word, Dragon Boy laid the printout on Starbright's desk. It was an offer from the Villainous Legions to join their cabal, a glorious package complete with full-time benefits and the potential to have his own henchmen.

Starbright whistled. "Defecting to the other side, then. Like I said, I don't blame you."

"What?" Dragon Boy had expected anger, shock, and at least a half-hearted attempt to convince him otherwise. Not this...strange acceptance.

"Y'know I used to be called Inferno, back in the day? I could never get past henchman status until I switched sides. Tell Dr. Danger and Freeze Frame that I say hi."
