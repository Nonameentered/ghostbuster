Dr. Danger ushered the Inspector Monroe to the dungeon entrance. "I'm proud to present to you my latest creation," he introduced. The darkened entranceway into the cave seemed typical, almost bizarrely clich√©, but Summer kept those thoughts to herself. She would not pass judgement until she had seen the entire dungeon.
  

  
"Thank you, Dr. Danger," Summer Monroe replied. He had contacted her a month ago teasing a dungeon to end all dungeons, a dungeon that would give any seasoned veteran a run for their money. These days, there were too many dungeon enthusiasts who'd seen it all, with hundreds of dungeons under their belts. Throughout it all, Dr. Danger was a superstar in the field, creating innovative new traps and contracting dastardly minions to man his creations. Summer had immediately jumped at the opportunity. 


"But why me? I've talked to a few other dungeon raters, and it sounds like you've given me an exclusive opportunity to review yours."

"Surely, you must know!" Dr. Danger exclaimed. "You are known for being one of the most impartial and consistent raters out there. And your piece in *Dungeons* *Weekly* was absolutely inspired. You know, it is *so* important for ratings to be accurate. Why, last weekend, I had a group of newbies attempt the Bloodlust Haunt. They'd seen one review from a random fellow on the internet who called it 'appallingly easy.' I tried my best to dissuade them, but I'm afraid I was unsuccessful. The cleanup afterwards was...quite involved."

"I see." Summer scribbled a few notes on her notepad, then moved towards the dungeon door. "Well, if you don't mind, I'd better get to work, then."

"I'll leave you to it." Dr. Danger bowed and disappeared in a puff of gray smoke. If anything, at least he had a great flair for the dramatic.

Clearing away the cobwebs, Summer touched her emerald pendant. "Iza? I'll be needing your help, now."

Summer's serpentine familiar materialized beside her. "Of course, miss. I'm ready whenever you are."

Taking a deep breath, Summer stepped over the threshold, entering the dark confines of the cave. She was quickly enveloped in pitch-black darkness. Striking a match, Summer lit her torch and looked around, getting her bearings.
