"Mrs. Tibbles?"

I crept along the edge of the wall, shaking a bag of her favorite treats. Once, sometime in late 1990s, she'd managed to get inside the walls while a contractor was replacing the microwave. Mischievous girl!  I'd spent hours looking for her, convinced that death was just around the corner for both of us.

Her plaintive meowing had given her away a few days later. I'd torn a hole in the plaster in my desperation to get her out. Not two hours later, she was back to perfectly normal - gobbling up treats, scratching up my furniture, and purring contentedly in my lap, without a care in the world for all the stress she'd caused me.

After living with Mrs. Tibbles for a few centuries, I'd learned a few things:

1. She will always want your attention, that is, up until the very moment you want to pay attention to her. In which case, she will suddenly have very pressing matters to attend to that do not involve you whatsoever.
2. Her favorite treats are the Greenies that are tuna-flavored. Heaven forbid I get the salmon or chicken-flavored ones.
3. Her daily routine for the past two centuries, has been as follows:

* 7 AM - 8 AM: Pester the Human for breakfast.
* 8 AM - 11 AM: Prowl around, looking for trouble.
* 11 AM - 5 PM: Nap. Occasionally get up to move to the sunniest spot in the house.
* 5 PM - 7 PM: Pester the Human for dinner.
* 7 PM - 9 PM: Snuggle on the Human's lap.
* 9 PM - 7 AM: Sleep.

Naturally, the 8 AM - 11AM slot was what gave me the most headache. Over the years, she's learned how to open cabinets, sneak into cupboards, and - as of today, it seems - squeeze through the hole in the screen door.

I smelled trouble in the air, stronger than the scent of Mrs. Tibbles's unscooped litter box. I *knew* I should've gotten the hole in the screen door fixed earlier! But I'd kept putting it off, day after day, and now it looked like I might not even have another day left. At least, not if I couldn't find Mrs. Tibbles soon and make sure she was out of harm's way.
