"Alright, Agent Moonlight to Agent Motherclucker. Do you hear me?"

"....quack."

"Very good, very good. Glad to hear everything is proceeding to plan. Naturally, nobody would be suspicious of a duck. After all, there are thousands of others at St. James's Park. Can you hear what they're saying?"

"Quack."

"Well, try to get a little closer. We need to find out what sort of dirty little state secrets are being passed between the Russians and our British turncoat here."

"QUAAACK."

"What's that? Yes, yes, I know the other ducks are very vicious. I have faith in your martial prowess. Just don't let them catch on that you're not a regular duck."

"Quack quack QUACK!"

"No! I don't care that the lovesick couple is throwing out tastier bread. Focus on the *mission*, Agent Motherclucker. You'll get your reward soon enough. They're supposed to be discussing the details of the next cyberattack and trading off a USB filled with highly confidential information. For heaven's sake, please focus!"

...

"Agent Motherclucker? Are you there? Do you copy?"

...

"Have you been compromised? Please reply, stat."

"Quack quack quack *quack*."

"You attacked the Russian? And grabbed the USB out of his hand? What were you thinking? Now our cover's been totally blown!"

"Quaaack!"

"Yes, I'm sure it was very shiny. But that doesn't make it okay."

"QUACK, quack quack."

"No, I'm not mad. Just...disappointed. Well, at least you've stolen whatever secrets are in there. Don't let them catch you, and try to blend in with the rest of the ducks. I'll come find you in a bit."
