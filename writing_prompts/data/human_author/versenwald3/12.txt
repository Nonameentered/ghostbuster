"Death is too good for him," Shak'ra glared balefully down at me. "Had we truly been mortal itinerants, his actions last night would have cut short the thread of four other lives."

"Well, he's already dead," Remsa pointed out. "So it matters not if Death is too good for him, for it has already happened to him. And to add to that, we are *not* mortal itinerants. So his actions last night did not cut short the thread of four others. In fact, his actions only affected a single life. His own."

Nephthia raised a hand, signaling for silence. "Remsa. We are here to mete out divine justice. Not to quibble over semantics. Shall we begin the recommendations?" 

"Twenty thousand years of purgatory, and no less," Shak'ra pronounced haughtily. 

"Steep," Jiraxi commented. "I vote for reincarnation as one of the lower beings."

Nodding, Nepthia quickly scribbled down notes on the tablet that she clutched with her lower set of arms. I'm not sure how she could write notes with just a finger on a stone tablet, but hey, gods follow their own rules. 

"Remsa?"

"Well, I've been feeling like a vacation, thanks for asking," Remsa replied lazily.

Nepthia scowled. "I was asking you what you think should be done about the mortal, Remsa."

"And I was telling you. I'm tired of godhood, and this bloke can take my place. I don't feel like I can hand down judgements anymore, especially since I'm starting to forget what it was like to be human. At least he'll have a fresh idea of what it's like."
