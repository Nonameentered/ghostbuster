Kneeling before his trusted blade, Hiroyuki muttered a prayer.

"I have not lived an honorable life, Ame-No-Habakiri. But I pray you will not fail me now."

Hiroyuki remembered the moment he had claimed the blade as if it were yesterday. All that power, glory, and skill. And at such a small cost - all he had to do was to live honorably.

Unfortunately, as a brash young warrior who was raring to prove his worth, the odds were not in Hiroyuki's favor. The fame and the glory had gone to his head. So many worthless battles, so many duels fought for the sake of pride, and for what? Hiroyuki wished he could tell his 18-year old self what he knows now.

There is no honor in seeking meaningless glory.

The downhill slide had been swift. His friends left him, tired of hearing his boasts about his conquests. Risa had said that he'd turned into nothing but a stuck-up narcissist who cared more about how the world saw him than their relationship.  She hadn't been too far off the mark, to be honest.

There had been other women. It was hard to resist them, when they threw themselves at him left and right. Risa was wonderful, but how could Hiroyuki say no to the most beautiful courtesans in Tokyo?

And then, Risa had left.

At the height of his fame, hailed as the greatest warrior in all of Japan, Hiroyuki looked around and realized he had nobody. Nothing but poets singing his praises, nemeses who sought to defeat him, and warlords hoping to recruit him.

Overwhelmed with his losses, he'd faltered in a battle. What was he fighting for if nobody in the world truly cared about him? No, Ame-No-Habakiri had not failed him. He'd given up, caught in existential apathy.

And then, those who still loved him abandoned him immediately. The poets turned to sing their praises to the man who had defeated him, his nemeses dismissed him as a washed-up swordsman, and the warlords sought to entice other warriors instead.

And Hiroyuki sank further into his black despair.

Now, here he sat on the forest ground, next to his mountainside cabin. His faithful blade in his hands. Wet snow seeping through his hakama.

He was twenty-three, and he had not led an honorable life.

The blade trembled as he brought the point to touch his chest.

Would it be quick? Would it be painful? Would anyone mourn his passing? The questions flew through his head as he steeled himself to do the honorable thing.

Hiroyuki closed his eyes. In one swift motion, he yanked the sword towards his heart.

There was a terrible, splitting, crack.

Ame-No-Habakiri lay before him, neatly broken into four separate pieces.

And Hiroyuki wept. Alone, in the bleached-white snow of the desolate forest, he cried for everything he had lost and everything he had taken for granted.

Ame-No-Habakiri was right. This was the coward's way out.

He would redeem himself.

Regain his honor.

Hiroyuki dried his tears on the sleeve of his yukata, then gingerly gathered up the pieces of Ame-No-Habakiri. Someday, somehow, he would prove to the gods that he was worthy of wielding the blade once more.
