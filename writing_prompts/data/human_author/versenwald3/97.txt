Weeblebrax the 3rd tapped the speaker nervously. It was her first time making contact with an alien planet, and she wanted to be sure that she did it correctly. She carefully input the numbers into the alien technology and put the receiver to her snout. The dial tone rang once, twice, then went quiet. 

Weeblebrax's lungs wheezed in nervous anticipation as she realized that someone on the other side had picked up.

"Hello? Yes, I want to confirm that this is Earth?"

The voice on the other end of the line chirrupped. "You have reached Open Sesame Streaming Services. Please listen carefully, as our menu options have changed."

All four of Weeblebrax's eyebrows furrowed. Only two sentences in, and she had already somehow made a basic communication error. She thought that she had called one of the biggest corporations on Earth, but somehow, she had reached a restaurant. No worries. Weeblebrax could salvage this.

"Excuse me, I'm sorry," Weeblebrax began hesitantly. " I don't want to order anything. Could you please put me in touch with the leaders of humanity?"

"I'm sorry, I don't understand your request," the voice beeped patiently. "Could you please repeat that?"

Weeblebrax scratched the backs of her ears. Perhaps her accent wasn't good enough? But she had spent the past twenty years studying old Earth movies and listening to podcasts. She tried again.

"I'd like to speak to your managers, please," she said.

"Ah," the voice replied. "I see you would like to speak to a representative. Is that correct?"

"Yes!" Weeblebrax cried. "Yes, yes. I would like to speak to a representative of humanity."

"All right," said the entity on the other end. "We are experiencing unusually long wait times due to staffing shortages. The wait time is currently at infinity plus one years. Would you like to leave a call back number?"

Sitting on the other side of the starship, Lentralli was having similarly bad luck. She had managed to connect to Earth's primitive hivemind, the World Wide Internet, but all the beings she had come into contact were simplistic and singleminded. She had structured her username to imitate what the logs had shown was a normal human pseudonym, as it was always respectful to mimic a culture's customs when making First Contact.

*xXLentralliXx*: *Hello. My name is Lentralli, and my ship and I come from outer space. We would like to land, please, and speak with your leaders.*

*SexySweetiexxx: Heyyyyy cutie! What are you doing tonight? ;)*

*xXLentralliXx: Hopefully, my crew members and I will be having a civilized conversation over dinner with the leaders of your planet. Would you know who to contact so we can secure a safe landing area?*

*SexySweetiexxx: Omgggg that sounds so interesting!!! I would love to have dinner with you xoxoxo*

Lentralli sighed. She knew where this conversation was headed, but still, she had to try. Her appendages flew across the keyboard, typing out her answer.

*xXLentralliXx: Sure. Where would you like to meet? And can we land our spaceship there? We'll need approximately 800 square feet.*

*SexySweetiexxx: I would loveeee to meet with you but before we do I need to buy plane ticekts to wherever you are. Could I use your credit card number??? It won't cost that much.*

It would be simple, trivial even, for Lentralli to spoof a credit card and link it to some Earth currency. But Raspagadden always said that it was important to make a good first impression, and Lentralli had a feeling that committing credit card fraud during First Contact would go against that.

*xXLentralliXx: Sorry. I don't have a credit card.*

*---SexySweetiexxx has disconnected from the chat---*
