Burt Divento twiddled his thumbs and stared at the buttons.

The buttons stared back at him.

Burt twiddled.

Strak had left about ten minutes ago, Burt hazarded. His exact words had been as follows: "I'll be back soon. Don't touch ANYTHING. Keep your hands clasped behind your back. Actually, that's a brilliant idea. Here, hold your hands behind your back just like this..."

It had taken Burt four minutes to wriggle out of the slapdash knot that Strak had tied around his hands. Two more minutes to undo the one tying him to the chair that was just out of reach from the control panel. Less than ten seconds to stride over to the blinking array of buttons, which were beckoning, begging to be pressed...

Burt continued to twiddle.

Just one button couldn't possibly hurt, right?  The innocuously-named "EJECT TRASH" couldn't possibly do any damage, right? And Strak would probably be grateful for the help. Taking out the trash was a boring chore. Burt could help him with that.

Stretching out a shaking finger, Burt pushed the button.

He watched as the trash chute unfurled itself from the spaceship, spilling refuse into the confines of deep space. And...was that a person?

Burt squinted. It did appear to be a humanoid figure. The figure looked quite familiar, in fact. It was waving its tentacles frantically and seemed to be yelling profanity towards the bridge.

What was it that Strak had gone to investigate again? Oh, that was right. The rest of what Strak had said came back to Burt. 

"It looks like the thumb drive containing the coordinates for Damogran somehow got tossed in the trash bin. I'm going to search for it, so stay put until I come back, okay?"

Scratching his head, Burt looked at the floating figure of Strak. Crap. Well, he'd better radio for help from the mothership. He gazed back at the blinking buttons...
