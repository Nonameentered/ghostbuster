*So you* ***are*** *real!* *Why won't you grant my wish? Is it because there's no oxygen in space? I read that last week in one of the books the nurses brought me. I guess that makes sense. I wouldn't want to go all the way up to space just to die. I'll take another wish. I wish I knew what your name was.*

**That is not a wish. That is a question.** 

*Alright then, what is your name?*

Six billion years, and nobody ever thought to ask me what my name was. Six billion years, and people wished and wished and wished and never cared who was on the other side. I've been given more than six thousand names, and none of them are the right one. I suppose it was not their fault; I never responded. 

**My name is Sirius.** 

*It's a pretty name. A pretty name for a pretty star. So do I get to pick a new wish, now?*

**Yes.** 

*Will you be my friend?*

We were approaching dangerous territory. She was curious, and I could not fault her for that. How many people could claim that they have spoken with a god? 

One ten-year-old girl couldn't hurt. 

**Yes. But that still isn't a wish. Will you pick a new one?**

She laughed, the sound bright and sparkling clear in the silence of the empty ward. 

*I think I'll save it. Maybe I'll need it one day, many years from now.*

I do not know if she understood that she was dying. Though I was humanity's creator, there was still so much about them that I did not comprehend. When do they understand the meaning of mortality? 

That night, for the first time in my many years of existence, I performed a miracle that nobody had wished for.
