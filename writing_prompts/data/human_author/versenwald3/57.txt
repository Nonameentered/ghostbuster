Thursday nights were for happy hour. Usually, I'd let loose, order a couple drinks, and hang out with the girls, you know? Sometimes, I'd go a little too hard and wake up the next morning with no memory of what shenanigans I'd gotten up to the night before. But really, it was par for the course. What college freshman hasn't blacked out once or twice while testing their limits?

But this Friday morning, I didn't wake up in my college dorm. Instead, I found myself trapped in a plexiglass prison. Peering out of my cell, I spotted strange liquids bubbling in oddly-shaped flasks. I took a few deep breaths, wiped my sweaty palms against my jeans, and sat on the cold stone floor. Glancing at my Apple watch (thank god I'd charged it last night!), I saw that it was 10:34. If Galahad was quick about it all, maybe I could make it to my 2 PM Classics seminar.

Settling my back against the wall, I shifted into a comfortable position. Hopefully it wouldn't take too long. Though it seemed like *this* villain was smart enough to disable LTE, so my watch couldn't point Galahad to wherever I was.

Was I scared? Well, no. You see, there's something about me that makes me, well, incredibly kidnapping-prone. Kidnappable, if that's a real word.

One. I'm probably the most beautiful person you'll ever meet. No, that's not me being full of myself. I've been stopped multiple times on the street by recruiters, asking if I want to go into modeling. This is what happens when one of your fairy godmothers "gives you a blessing" and curses you with ethereal, otherworldly, beauty.

Two. Galahad's my brother. Sure, Galahad's girlfriends get kidnapped all the time, but villains *know* that the best, most surefire way of getting his attention is to go after his baby sister. After all, he's always been the quintessential overprotective older brother. As a villain, you really don't want to go to all the effort of kidnapping a girl only to find out that she was a random Tinder hookup and that Galahad hasn't texted her in two months.

Three. My father is King Rudolphus. Not only does that mean I'm worth a *lot* of hostage money, it means that I can be used as leverage in negotiating over foreign lands and property. Never you mind that no villain *ever* has gotten *any* hostage money from my dad, they still think that they'll be the lucky ones who hit the jackpot.
