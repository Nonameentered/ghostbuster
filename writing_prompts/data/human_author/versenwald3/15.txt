The two crowded around the oddly flat stone that Enxa had repurposed as a coffee table. Spread across it was a crudely drawn map. Bashuk pointed at it now, making marks in certain locations with a piece of charcoal.

"*This* is where the dark wizard Renegal resides. He's been pretty miffed that all his takeovers for power haven't been working. He could be casting some kind of evisceration or decimation spell that causes a cataclysmic event. Possible if he has a kind of 'if I can't have it, then nobody can', mentality."

She pointed eastwards now, marking off a small clearing in the Darkshine forest. "And *this* here is where the cultists of Ash'ogath pray to their twisted gods. They're trying to open up a portal to allow Vasha'kkor into this world, so that she can consume all living beings in Valysia."

And halfway across Valysia, in the middle of the Runegold ocean: "*This* is where arcane scientists have reported strange sightings of a giant, serpentine, creature. It could be Norgrad from the legends of old, preparing to surface and swallow the world whole."

Enxa cut in. "You know we're screwed, right? This effort is doomed to failure. How are we supposed to travel across all of Valysia, investigate these completely different world-ending events, and somehow figure out how to stop them? And in six days, no less?" She scratched her chin, and wrinkled her brow as another thought occurred to her. "Not to mention the standard error. We might have only four days' time."

Bashuk grinned. "Wouldn't it be cool to be part of a heroic last-ditch attempt that's doomed to fail? And besides, I've prioritized them. According to the runic Ash'ogath calendar, there's supposed to be some big event happening soon. We should check that one out first."

"Okay, fine. Let's say that I'm hypothetically on board with this." Enxa pointed towards Darkshine forest on the map. "How would we even get there? It's a five day's walk, we live in the middle of absolutely nowhere, and even if a traveling merchant came by, the likelihood that they'll want to give a ride to a goblin and an orc is near nil."

The doorbell rang. Well, "doorbell" was a bit of a generous descriptor. Really, it was more of a string tied to a jumble of old rat bones, but it served its purpose.

From the other side of the door came a small, tinny, voice.

"Excuse me? I think I'm lost...do you know the way to Darkshine forest?"
