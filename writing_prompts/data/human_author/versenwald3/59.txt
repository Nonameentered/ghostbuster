"All right, children. I know it's exciting that we've found a town that hasn't been completely destroyed by the Calamity, but remember, we need to stay focused. We'll start salvaging things soon, but first, does everyone have their buddy?" Mrs. Frankle scanned the ragtag group of youngsters standing before her, quickly doing a mental headcount.

There was no reply. Kendra, Devon, and Kay were playing some sort of patty-cake game with each other, Hunter was digging in the dirt, and Rachel was - "No! We don't put strange things in our mouth, Rachel!"

The four-year-old dropped the crusty soda can that had been in the dirt for who knows how long, guiltily averting her eyes from Mrs. Frankle's disapproving stare.

"Okay. 1 2 3, eyes on me!" Mrs. Frankle clapped her hands, yelling out the rhyme.

"1, 2, eyes on you," the group of children chorused, turning their eyes toward her. She guessed that she had at least twenty seconds before their attention started wandering again.

"I'll ask again. Does everyone have their buddy?" Mrs. Frankle frowned, trying to count the children again. It seemed that two of them were missing. The buddy system was good, but not infallible. Not for the first time, she wished there was a rulebook for navigating the apocalypse. Good thing her first-grade teaching experience was coming in handy.

"Kay. Where's your buddy? Priya?"

"Priya's not my buddy anymore," Kay replied absentmindedly. "I traded with James 'cause he has a crush on her. And now I get to play with Devon and Kendra!"

Mrs. Frankle's heart plummeted. She cleared her throat, trying to stay calm. "You can't just trade buddies just like that, Kay. Do you know where they went?"

I don't know," Kay said. "I wasn't really paying attention."

Corralling sheep, that's what it was. It was easier with a classroom, with boundaries and walls and other teachers. But ever since the Calamity, she'd had to keep moving. Every day, the volcanic fog crept a little closer. And goodness knows there were drifters and brigands about, ready to take advantage of anyone who looked weak.

Mrs. Frankle sat down on the ground, covering her face with her hands. She wasn't sure what to do next.

Priya and James were missing. Rachel was putting the can back into her mouth again, and Mrs. Frankle didn't have the energy to care. Honestly, she was tired. Tired of having to always know the answers, tired of being cheerful all the time, tired of soothing the children's spirits when her own were flagging so miserably.

"Actually," Devon piped up, walking over to Mrs. Frankle. "I think I saw where they went. I can take you there."

Mrs. Frankle stood back up abruptly, trying to wipe her eyes surreptitiously. "Yes. Let's go there at once," she said. "Everyone, follow me. And make sure to keep track of your buddy!"

Devon led the group into one of the small houses in the town. The curtains were drawn, and it was dark inside. Mrs. Frankle peered around, trying to see where two small children could be hiding.

Suddenly, the curtains drew back, flooding the inside of the house with sunlight. Priya and James stood before her, waving cheerfully, and Mrs. Frankle's admonishments died on her lips.

"Surprise!" the children cheered.

On the ground were hundreds of wild dandelions and daisies and buttercups, golden and blooming and beautiful. They were arranged in a circle around messy words that were scratched on the floor in charcoal.

THANK YOU MISSES FRANKEL. WE LOVE YOU.

"Kay?" whispered Priya. "Why is Mrs. Frankle crying? Did we do it wrong?"

"No," Kay smiled. "I think we did it just right."
