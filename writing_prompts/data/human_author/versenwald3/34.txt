Sirius Controller #21:

Records show that you deviated from protocol at 8:30 AM on June 16th. You were reassigned to this department five months ago, and Train A has now been early two times.

As you know, disruptions to train schedules are highly irregular and can cause distress to the humans involved. You have been an invaluable asset to the department, and I believe that there must be a good reason for this irregularity. I am requesting a written explanation for your actions. After review, I will then determine whether you shall be transferred to a new department. Please submit your response by EOD on June 18th.

Dear ManagerBot #03,

Thank you for the note.

I would like to tell you a story about a boy and a girl. They went to elementary school and middle school together, and they were best friends for many years. Eventually, love bloomed, and they were each other's first kiss. Then, the boy's father got a new job in the city. There were no cellphones back then, so they wrote letters to each other every week.

But as the years went by, they got busy with other things. The letters went down to once a week, then once a month, then once a year. Then, one letter was buried under a mountain of bills, the girl thought "I'll get to it later", and she never did.

Twenty years later, she's just moved to the city. They're both single. She catches the A train to work at 8:30 AM from the Queen's Garden stop, and he catches the 8:45 AM. Do you not agree that this is fate? Who am I to stop these star-crossed lovers from meeting once more?

Respectfully yours,

\-Sirius Controller #21

Sirius Controller #21:

While I respect the amount of emotional investment you have poured into these two souls, I would like to tell you another story.

It is about a man who catches the 8:30 AM to work every day.

The babysitter arrives at 8 AM every morning. Sometimes, she runs a little late. After she arrives, he walks his two older children to school, dropping them off at 8:20 AM. Then, he runs for the 8:30 train so that he can get to work before 9 AM.

He has been written up for lateness two times, now. Three strikes, and his career is in jeopardy.

Sirius Controller #21, I understand it is easy to get attached to certain humans. But you must remember that our purpose is to maintain order. When you favor one mortal, you may be endanger another's livelihood.

We will be requesting your transfer to a lower-priority department, effective immediately.
