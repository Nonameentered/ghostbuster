For years, Lailah tried to die.

But she was never successful. I mean, obviously. If she had been, she wouldn't be standing here with Viktor, ready to push the big red button to annihilate all living beings.

It had all started when she was six. 

The experiments. The radiation. The scientists, in their clean white lab coats, in their clean white laboratories, taking notes on clean white paper while she writhed and screamed in pain. All in the name of bettering the human race. Or, more likely, all in the name of bettering a certain wealthy benefactor who hoped to unlock the secret to immortality. 

Eventually, one scientist with a guilty conscience had confessed. The lab was shut down, but by then, it was too late. The damage had already been done.

Lailah could no longer die.

Even after she was liberated, not much changed. There were new scientists that were in charge of her. More experiments were initiated, this time with the blessing of the government. Of course, Lailah was given the option to decline. But really, what choice did she have?  

When she was thirteen, she'd tried to say no. The media had a field day, vilifying her as a "spoiled young brat who refused to share the secret to immortality". The public turned against her.  Unable to bear the weight of the worlds' scorn, Lailah volunteered to return the lab a mere three days later. 

At eighteen, Lailah had finally grown a backbone. She was done with experiments, done with scientists. Humanity could die for all she cared. She shuttered herself away in a tiny apartment in South Boston, subsisting on nothing but Chinese takeout and trash TV. She'd been putting the trash out when she'd stumbled across the smoking wreckage that was Viktor.

By all rights, she should have let him die. It would have been a mercy, one that she herself had begged for many times before. But she saw the desperate light in his eyes, that burning determination to carry on. Lailah gave him a second chance, and the rest was history.

And now, here they stood in their tiny, 800-square foot apartment. Scattered around them were the things that they had collected over the past ten years - that LCD TV that a neighbor didn't want, a crotchety stray cat named Jinx, and, of course, the doomsday device. *Their* doomsday device.

"Well, here goes," Lailah said. She moved her thumb towards the button, feeling a sudden pang of *something* in her stomach. Maybe it was the celebratory Indian food they'd had, or maybe it was regret. 

She would hit the button soon, and then it would all be over.

\---

But did she really want it to all be over? Well, it was what Viktor wanted, wasn't it? And Lailah wanted Viktor to be happy. Glancing over at Viktor, Lailah felt her heart execute a perfect somersault. 

He'd done so much for her. For the first time in years, *years*, she could finally sleep through the whole night without the fear of seeing those clean white coats in those clean white laboratories. For the first time in her entire life, she finally felt safe. And for the first time in a long time, she looked forward to something. Looked forward to spending more time with him, learning what he liked and disliked, exploring every minute detail that made Viktor, well, *Viktor*. 

And with a sudden shock of clarity, Lailah realized that she no longer wanted to die.
