Six days. A little less than a week's time. That's all the time that world of Valysia had left.

At least, that's what the wizards said. Give or take one or two days. Divining was a *tricky* business, after all, and uncertainty was the only certainty.

Highwizard Gnoke Redwood had been the first to see the signs in his crystal ball. At first, he had thought that he'd forgotten to turn it on. He rubbed the shimmery surface, squinted myopically, and spun it around. Perhaps it had stopped working?

But no.

The green ON button was very clearly flashing. The crystal ball was functioning, but all that Gnoke could see was...darkness.

Perhaps it was a user error?

Gnoke gathered all his finest colleagues (yes, even the ones who used tea-leaves), and together, they performed the most concerted divination effort in history.

The results were undeniable.

The entire tarot deck transformed into copies of the 13th trump, the dice turned into actual knucklebones, and the lecanomancer's water turned to poison.

And to top it all off, when brewed, the tea leaves created a strangely aromatic bitter brew that gave Highwizard Deacon a splitting headache, rendering him useless for the rest of the day.

Amidst all the certainty of uncertainty, one thing was certain: unless drastic measures were taken, the world would soon be ending. After Gnoke's announcement, there was a mass panic.

Workers quit their jobs in droves.

Young women binge-watched the final season of Unwed Singles in Paradisia.

Philosophers argued furiously about the different catastrophes that could bring about Valysia's demise.

Many taverns shut down after running out of supplies, due to an unprecedented surge in demand for "alcohol, any kind of alcohol, seriously, I will drink whatever you have".

And in a remote cave, somewhere far beyond the edges of civilization, Bashuk Boghimmer calmly set aside the wild boar she was spit-roasting, hocked a loogie into the fire, and set off to find Enxa of the Golden Tooth.
