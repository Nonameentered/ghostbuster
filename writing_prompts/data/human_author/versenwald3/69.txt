"Two words: Pink. Floyd," Tsukuyomi, the dark side of the moon, flipped his hair as he strutted into the intergalactic party. Walking in behind him, his twin sister Selene glowered darkly at him. 

All the humans *loved* Tsukuyomi. What was so great about him? Looking him up and down, Selene rolled her eyes. Jagged emo bangs. Snake bites. An edgy tattoo. Sure, maybe he was cool and romantic to the Earthlings, but to the rest of the galaxy, he was just a kid who still lived with his parents in his childhood bedroom. 

"It's funny, isn't it?" Tsukuyomi brushed the bangs out of his face, grinning. "I'm the dark side of the moon, but all the spotlights are on me. How many pieces of poetry have been written about you, sis?"

Selene shoved her hands deeper into her pockets. "Who's counting?" she replied airily. "I'm too busy to keep track of things like that."

Tsukuyomi laughed jauntily, acting as if he hadn't heard. "Right, right. Who would write a song that talks about being as mysterious as the light side of the moon? No, no, it's gotta be me. But oh, are those some hors d'oeuvres? My stomach doth hunger!" Sauntering off towards the tables, he left Selene behind.

"Insufferable, isn't he?" Xihe appeared behind Selene, his radiance briefly blinding her. "I'm sorry you have to deal with that."

Selene grimaced. "I wonder why he cares so much. Surely, he must see that nobody in the heavens gives a shit. They're just mortals."

Xihe coughed politely. "For what it's worth, my daughter, Sunna, was equally intolerable when she was your age."

"Oh?" Selene raised an eyebrow.

Xihe nodded, folding his arms in front of his chest. "Yes, quite. The Beatles came out with a song, and she would *not* stop singing it. Family karaoke after Thanksgiving dinner? Only one song - Here Comes the Sun. High school talent show? Here Comes the Sun, performed on acoustic guitar. Her cellphone ringtone? I'll give you three guesses."

"Here Comes the Sun?" Selene smiled. 

Xihe bowed his head in affirmation. "It's not much, but be glad that there's at least a whole album for him to cycle through."
