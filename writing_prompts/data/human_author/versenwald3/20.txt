"So, how was, um, science class?" My gut roiled with anxiety. My superpowers hadn't manifested yet, but I didn't need clairvoyance to tell me that this date was *not* going well.

Clarissa twirled a piece of hair around her fingers, refusing to meet my gaze. "Um. Diane. We're in the same science class. You were there. I guess it was okay?"

Oh. Duh. Right. My mind flailed about for other conversation topics, and landed on a horribly cliche one - the weather.

"So it's been really sunny out," I continued on, desperately.

"Uh, yeah. We live in San Francisco. It's *always* sunny out." Was it just me, or was that a trace of exasperation in her voice?

Luckily, the waiter picked that exact moment to arrive with our food. Some sushi for her, and some Japanese curry for me. We couldn't have awkward conversation if our mouths were full, right?

"Well. Hope the food is good!" I forced an awkward grin at her. "I'll go ahead and dig in."

And then.

Then.

It happened.

At first, it felt like heartburn. Or indigestion. But the thing was, I hadn't really started eating yet, so it couldn't possibly be indigestion.

The bubbling feeling in my gut slowly traveled further and further upwards until it exploded in an ungainly burp. I felt my cheeks reddening from embarrassment.

"Um. Are you okay?" Clarissa was finally looking in my direction, her eyes wide.

"Of course," I said through my teeth. "I'm so sorry, I must have had too much soda before we got here."

"It's just that...you set fire to the tablecloth." I followed her shocked gaze down to the tablecloth. Grabbing my napkin, I quickly beat out the small blaze and tried to plaster a smile back onto my face.

"Er, that wasn't me, it's just that, well, this curry is really spicy, you know."

"Um. Japanese curry isn't spicy," Clarissa pointed out. As she said the words, I felt the *bubbling* inside me start up again, only much more intense than before.

"I - uh - have to go." I stood up abruptly. As I did so, I accidentally slammed the back of my chair against the hard concrete wall, causing the entire restaurant to look our way. 

At this point, I was pretty sure my face was redder than the backside of a fertile female chimpanzee. I dashed to the women's room and made it to a toilet just in time, barfing up a small wildfire.

With a sickening hiss, the flames collided with the toilet water. The ensuing steam fogged up my glasses and covered me with a fine mist.

Great.

I debated climbing out of the bathroom window. Clarissa didn't even seem to like me that much, anyways. Perhaps a graceful - or graceless - exit was in order. And besides, things couldn't really get worse from here, could they?
