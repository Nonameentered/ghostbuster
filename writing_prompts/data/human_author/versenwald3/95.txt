Wanda stared at the sword in her hands.

Over the many years, she'd realized one overarching truth: her power would always give her the tools needed for whatever the job was. However, it was up to her to figure out what she was actually supposed to do. Usually it was fairly straightforward - pens were meant for writing, axes were for trees, and lockpicks were for breaking locks, obviously.

Swords were meant for killing.

Wanda had never killed a man before. Turning over the ancient weapon in her hands, she inspected the jagged blade, the unadorned hilt, the golden crosspiece. The glyphs that ran along the edge were dull and scratched, but she had the uncanny feeling that in a bygone time, they had meant something, once.

Wanda had lived in this hermitage for the past twenty years on her own. After all, living by yourself was easy if you always had the right tools. And besides, people were scared of her powers. She avoided them, and they avoided her, and for the most part, both parties were successful.

But tools always manifested the same day they were needed. Before the day's end, she would surely meet whoever it was meant for.

It was sunset. Wanda shifted uncomfortably in her hard wooden seat, watching the last rays of daylight disappear behind the rolling hills.

For the first hour, she had stood waiting outside the door, holding the sword aloft and ready. During the second hour, she had let the point of the blade begin to droop downwards,  arms unused to the hefty weight. The third hour, she had gone inside to sit down. After all, she mused, there was only one entrance to the door. Certainly, she would have the jump on any intruders as they fiddled with the lock.

The door clattered against its wooden frame, and Wanda snapped to attention, lifting the battered claymore. Muscles tensed, she waited for the intruder to enter, minutes ticking by.  A drop of sweat rolled down her cheek as her arms, already tired from her earlier exertions, strained against the weight of the weapon.

Nothing. The sun finished its journey across the sky, and the cold of the winter night began seeping in through the windows. Wanda crept to the door and undid the latch with one hand, holding the blade ready with the other.

At her doorstep was a sleeping babe, no more than a few weeks old. Clutched in his fingers, a golden ring stamped with the royal insignia glinted from the weak moonlight.

Suddenly, everything became clear. Pens were for writing. Axes were for chopping. Lockpicks were for breaking locks.

And this sword was for the rightful king.
