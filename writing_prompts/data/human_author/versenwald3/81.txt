"Well, well, well. Looks like someone's just finished doing my dirty work for me." The stranger's hazel eyes glinted in the darkness. My hands were steady as I leveled my handgun at his head, aiming between those beautifully bright eyes.

"Hey, now," I replied. "I spent a whole hour digging this. You wouldn't *believe* how many rocks are in the soil. Sod off and do your own dirty work, or this won't be the only body I bury tonight." With one hand, I rolled the remains of Sir Linus Bradsworth into the pit, keeping my weapon trained on the stranger.

"The hole's quite large," the stranger remarked. "I'm sure it could fit two, if you're willing to share."

"And what's in it for me?" I cocked my head, considering his request. Bradworth's body slid down into the darkness, and there was a satisfying thump as it hit the bottom. Bastard. He'd deserved it. The justice system wouldn't punish him, so I'd had to take matters into my own hands, as it were.

Shrugging carelessly, the stranger moved closer. "Maybe I'll help you fill the dirt back in once they're both buried. Maybe I won't turn you into the cops. Maybe I'll take you on a romantic spree, getting back at everyone who's ever wronged us." In the half-light, I hadn't been able to figure out who he was, but as he stepped into the clearing, the moonlight illuminated his face.

I gasped. "Ryan?"

He smiled crookedly at me, light glinting off of his one silver tooth. "I saw the news. It was easy enough to figure out who you were. *The Scarlet Vigilante*. You always did have a flair for the dramatics, but really? Leaving a single scarlet glove at each crime scene? Seems a bit risky to me."

"I haven't gotten caught yet," I mumbled dazedly, still coming to terms with the situation.

"Anyhow," Ryan said, tossing his victim at me. "I figured you would need some help getting back at those bastards." I looked at the body, startling as I recognized the face of Colonel Rufus Marovic.

He grinned. "Seven out of ten, three more to go."
