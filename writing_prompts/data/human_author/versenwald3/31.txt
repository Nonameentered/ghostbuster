For the last thirty-four years of his life, Oleg Jamison had sold apples.

Oleg's da had sold apples.

Oleg's da's da had sold apples.

The fruit stand was essentially a member of the family, a cherished keepsake passed down from Jamison to Jamison over many generations.

One of Oleg's earliest memories was helping his da out with the stand on a busy market day, counting out change and keeping an eye out for thieving fingers.

When Oleg's da had passed ownership of the fruit stand over to him, he had pulled Oleg aside.

"Oleg," he'd said. "There will be men passing by who will not want to buy your apples. Instead, they will want to sell you things."

Oleg had seen similar men before. They would arrive, bearing countless bags of useless junk. His father would always pull them into the back room of the shop, shutting the door behind them. Oleg had tried to listen in on their conversations before, but all he could hear were snatches of whispered exchanges and the clink of coins exchanging hands.

"If you remember nothing that I've taught you, son, remember this."

Oleg's father placed his hands on Oleg's shoulders, staring deeply into his eyes. "Buy it all. Buy every single thing they offer you."

After thirty-four years, Oleg had amassed a considerable collection of tattered spellbooks, battered shields, and monster organs. At times, he had questioned his father's advice, especially when he'd paid several copper for some slime ooze. Still, he obeyed.

Oleg had thought he would spend the rest of his life selling apples and buying goods from strangers. But two months ago, everything had changed.

Some *adventurer* had come by and sold him a few things. In the meantime, the adventurer had also decided to take a few things. Namely, Oleg's wife.

And so it was that Oleg decided he was done with apples. He sold the fruit stand to a cousin (another Jamison, of course), went down into his formidable stockroom, and picked out a pointy weapon. The words on the blade declared it the Dark Moon Greatsword, but Oleg hadn't the faintest idea what that could possibly mean.

He strapped the sword to his back, mounted his brother-in-law's old pony, and headed off into the sunset.

Oleg was going to find the adventurer, and there would be hell to pay.
