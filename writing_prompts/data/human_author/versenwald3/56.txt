"Oho!" a voice rang out merrily. "I see that you are awake, Adrianna." Surprisingly, I heard his voice clearly through the thick plexiglass, which I'd have thought would have been a better sound insulator. But what do I know? I'm not a physics major, and for good reason.

A young man tottered down the spiral staircase that led into the lab. I recognized him instantly - Dr. Cypher, aka Brendan Zhao. He'd graduated two years ago, and he actually TA'ed my mandatory prereq Chemistry class. 

Surprisingly, he'd actually been a pretty cool TA before he decided to, you know, go into a life of crime. I hadn't really stayed up to date with what he'd been up to, but I heard he was in the market of making illicit drugs. I stayed silent. Usually these villains were so lonely that they could chatter for hours on end, with nary a word from myself. 

Brendan was no outlier. "I don't know if you remember me, but I was once in charge of instructing you during laboratory sessions. I know we plebeians are probably all the same to you - no elven blood, no fairy godmothers, no trace of magic in our veins. But I remember you clearly. Your impeccable lab reports. Your astonishingly amazing mathematics skills. Your laser precision in measuring out volatile reagents."

This was new. Usually, villains gushed over my devastating beauty or boasted of how they would use me to bargain with my dad. Was Brendan really going to spend the next few hours praising my subpar lab skills? And did he *really* remember me? More like half-finished lab reports, a complete disregard for fundamental mathematics principles, and an *extremely* laissez-faire attitude towards measuring out volatile ingredients. 5.04 grams and 5.34 grams, were close enough, right?

"Anyways, I was thinking, while you're here, you'd do well as an extra set of hands. I'm making another batch of Euphoria tonight, and the client wants it by tomorrow. It'll probably take Galahad a few hours to arrive, and it's nice to have some help."

I couldn't help myself. "Are you kidding?" I blurted out. "You *clearly* don't remember me at all. I was probably the worst bio student ever. The only reason why I passed was because you literally spent hours walking me through basic concepts."

Brendan continued speaking quickly and loudly. "Well, you see, the client paid for this laboratory. And this state of the art equipment. It's quite good at measuring things. And *monitoring* things, you know. And I've been working for this client for the past two years, and they've been *truly* a *pleasure* to work with." He met my eyes, and therein, I saw a glint of manic desperation. "And after two years, *two years*, I've finally convinced them that it would be nice to have someone to work with."

Shit. Brendan hadn't picked a life of crime. He'd been forced into it.  

It was clever, I'll admit. With me as his "lab partner", he was guaranteed to have Galahad show up. I just had to figure out how to keep Galahad from attacking Brendan the moment he burst into the lab, sword drawn and blazing with righteous fury.
