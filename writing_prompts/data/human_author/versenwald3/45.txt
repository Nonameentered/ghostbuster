Brian whipped around. Blinked twice. Rubbed his eyes. Blinked again.

The last Brian had seen Blair, she'd been sprawled on the floor of her dorm room, bleeding out from four stab wounds in her back. He'd waited and watched as the light in her eyes had gone out. He couldn't risk her surviving. If she survived and remembered her attacker, it would be the electric chair from Brian. No, that wouldn't do at all.

Which is why her current form was all the more shocking. She wasn't alive, no, not at all, but her ghostly specter floated alongside Kai. Kai shot Brian a dirty glare, but Blair smiled sunnily at him.

Brian's blood went cold. What the *fuck* was going on?

"Feeling ready for the exam?" Blair tucked a strand of translucent hair behind her ears.

Ah. That. The biology final. Brian hadn't studied for it at all. He'd been busy doing research for...other things. And besides, Brian had assumed that classes would be cancelled after the police found the gruesome scene in Dorm 402.

Too shocked to reply, all he could do was watch as Kai and Blair walked - no, glided - past him into the science building.

By the time managed to walk to class in a confused daze, the exam room was nearly full. Unluckily, the only seat left was the one directly behind Blair. Instead of looking down at his exam paper, all he could do was stare at the bleeding gashes between her shoulder blades.

"Brian!" Professor Ramora belted out his name, startling him from his reverie. "Eyes on your own papers, please! I won't have any cheating in my classroom."

"B-but she's dead!" Brian raised a trembling finger at Blair's transparent form. "She can't take the exam!"

Professor Ramora pursed her lips. "Yes, yes, she's dead. A little bit rude of you to point it out like that, and it doesn't mean she's excused from the final. Really, Brian, if you cannot calm down, I'll have to kick you out of the exam hall for disruptive behavior."

Standing up abruptly, Brian pushed back his chair, which fell to the floor with a loud clang. "Why is everyone acting so normally? What the fuck is going on? Doesn't anyone care about who did it? Where are the cops? Where are the reporters? Why the fuck do we still have class?"

Sighing, Professor Ramora took off her glasses and began wiping them the edge of her blouse. "If you insist on causing such a commotion, I will have to expel you from the room and automatically fail you. Is that what you want, Mr. Reese?"

"I'm just saying, there clearly was a murder, and the murderer could be in this very room, and nobody seems to give half a shit!" Brian gesticulated wildly at Kai.

"And why do you think Kai did it?" Professor Ramora asked sharply.

"Well, she was found dead in her dorm room, right? Her roommate was fucking holding the knife that did it! It's obvious. I'm not sure why Kai's even still in this room and not in a jail cell, waiting for the death penalty."

"She wasn't found in her dorm room," Kai said quietly.

"What the fuck do you mean by that? That's where I left her. I fucking watched her die. Where the fuck else could she have gone? What kind of fucking bullshit are you spewing, Kai? I should've killed you too, only there wouldn't have been anyone to pin the murder on."

Brian had been completely preoccupied during his rant. Suddenly, Professor Ramora was standing right beside him.

"That sounds awfully like a confession to me, Brian Reese." Pulling out a handgun, she leveled it at his head. "The cops will be here soon, and I'm sure they'd like to hear all about what you have to say regarding Ms. Zhang's unfortunate demise. In the meantime, I'd advise you not to make any sudden movements."

Blair turned back to look up at him, and Brian swore she smirked. 

"No hard feelings, right?" she mouthed.
