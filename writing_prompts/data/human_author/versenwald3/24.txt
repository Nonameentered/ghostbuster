Princess Amira lounged on her cozy chaise, nursing her third glass of wine. I'd have to stop her after this one. A glass or two every so often was fine, but this was starting to turn into a *habit*. "So, how do you think this one'll do?" she quirked an eyebrow at me.

"I don't know, looks like all brawn and no brains." I snorted, and a puff of smoke curled out of my nostrils. "Though who knows? Lord knows *I* shouldn't be judging a book by its cover."

I was in my usual place - comfortably curled around the sofa, lying in front of the wide-screen LCD TV that Amira had gotten installed a few years ago. The installation guy had been sweet - name of Bob, if I remember correctly - but Amira had said she wasn't interested. Figures. She's always liked the emotionally unavailable jerkwads. And I always had to be there for her whenever it inevitably ended tragically.

Which is why I started adding the tests. It's always a hoot, watching them ride up to the tower, swords drawn and clanking around in full armor, only to realize that the tests they were facing would require nothing of the sort.

"All right, looks like he's reached the first barrier," I narrated. 

Prince Rufus of Queensdale had dismounted from his ebony white charger and was carefully inspecting the words that had been etched into the tower stones.

IF THE PRINCESS HAS HAD A BAD DAY, WHAT SHOULD YOU DO?

Below, there were five multiple choice options that corresponded with different doors. If the prince opened the right door, he could continue on. If not...all the other doors led to trapdoors that would boot him out of the tower. 

Prince Rufus's hand briefly hovered over the door that corresponded to LEAVE HER ALONE, SHE'LL GET OVER IT. He spent a longer time standing in front of the GIVE HER A NICE MASSAGE AND TREAT HER TO HER FAVORITE FOODS door. But my heart jumped a little when he stood firmly in front of the COMMUNICATE WITH HER AND ASK WHAT SHE WOULD PREFER door and pulled it open. Perhaps....

But no. There were still more tests for him to pass. It was too soon for me to get my hopes up.
