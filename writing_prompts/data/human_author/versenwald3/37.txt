"OH BUGGER."

Death straightened up from the computer, dusting off his impeccably black robes. The gesture was purely for show, of course - the cloak of the Bringer of Shadows and Herald of Eternal Ends was always darker than the blackest of nights. You know, the kind of nights where witches strip naked and dance around circles and bump around into one another quite a lot since they can't see where they're going.

"What seems to be the matter, master?" Albert glanced up from his writing, face creased in concern.

Death flicked through the filing cabinets with his phalanges, making tiny musical clicking sounds with each flick. "I'M LOOKING FOR A PICTURE."

"You're going to need to be a little more specific than that."

"WELL. IF YOU MUST KNOW. I'M LOOKING FOR A PICTURE OF MISS FLITWORTH. I'M PRETTY SURE IT WAS ON A YOO ESS BEE. OR A FLOPPY DISK."

Albert suppressed a grin. "Feeling a little nostalgic, aren't we?"

"SHUT UP AND HELP ME LOOK."

The problem, Death reflected, wasn't that there wasn't enough storage space. No, no, that wasn't it at all.  The problem was that there were *far too many* spaces where things could be stored.

Was it packed away in one of the hundreds of photo albums in his library? Or had he digitized it? Was it floating about in one of those old computers that could barely boot up? Was it on Dropbox? Google Drive? iPhoto?

"You know, you're woefully disorganized for someone who's in charge of all the souls on Discworld," Albert remarked. "I wonder if I shouldn't be alarmed."

"OH SHOVE IT. AND I DIDN'T NEED YOUR HELP ANYWAYS. IT'S RIGHT HERE, ON GOOGLE DRIVE. RENATA UNDERSCORE FLITWORTH DOT JAY-PEE-GEE."

Death attempted to squint at the screen myopically, which was harder than you would think, considering he had no eyeballs, and indeed, none of the muscles required for squinting. Despite all this, it was still a valiant effort.

Double clicking on the image, Death folded his arms and waited....

"ALBERT?"

Albert recognized that tone. It was the tone of a man on the brink of desperation. It was a tone of a man who was, against all odds, trying to keep it together.

"WHAT DOES 'FILE CORRUPTED' MEAN?"
