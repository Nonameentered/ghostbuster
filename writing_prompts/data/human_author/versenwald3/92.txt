"Excuses, excuses." Alucard sat down in the wooden chair, crossing his legs elegantly. "Vanna, you know my opinions on the matter. I've always found labels to be so...restrictive."

Vanna's eyes narrowed. "And yet, they are what define us. Vampires. Bloodsuckers. *Monsters*. This is what the humans call us. Why should we save them? They would sooner stake us than accept our help."

Alucard's voice dropped to a whisper. "You forget, Vanna, that we too were human once."

"I forget *nothing."* Slamming a fist down onto the table, Vanna glared angrily into Alucard's eyes, seeing her own face reflected in his pitch-black irises. "I do not forget the day that the so-called priests came to my village. I do not forget watching the people I risked my life to cure turn their backs on me. I do not forget the *agony* of my lungs burning for air as the weight of God's judgement dragged me to the bottom of that lake."

"And yet, a human rescued you." Alucard remained calm in the face of Vanna's fury.

Eyes flicking to where Evanlyn sat reading in the corner, Vanna composed herself. "She is human no longer."

"That is not my point." Idly tracing his fingers along the well-worn carvings on the armrests of the chair, Alucard continued onwards. "This is humanity's darkest hour. Monsters have been released from the depths of hell. They who once were predators now find themselves at the bottom of the food chain. *This*, Vanna, is a chance to change humanity's mind. A chance for *vampire* to mean something different. A word that inspires hope rather than fear. A word that, when said, causes humanity to cheer, not cower. Is that not something you desire?"

Looking at the set of his jaw, the determination in his eyes, Vanna knew there would be no changing Alucard's mind. Vanna had one choice - she and Evanlyn could follow him into his insane plan, or leave him to fend off the demons on his own.

They'd spent too many lifetimes together for her to abandon him now.

Vanna sighed. "What the hell. I've always wanted to wear a cape."
