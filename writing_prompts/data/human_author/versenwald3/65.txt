"So, let me get this straight. You want me to be the god of Death. It's a 24/7 hour job, I don't get vacation or breaks, and there are no holidays?" Lucy raised a skeptical eyebrow at Zeus the Mighty, king of Gods and the ruler of Olympus.

"Er...yes?" Zeus replied hesitantly. "But you get immortality! And supreme power over the lives of mortals! Really, every day will be like a holiday. A working holiday."

"That sounds suspiciously like company propaganda."

"Lucy, I'm being completely honest with you now. We're very short-staffed and your resume stood out. What do you want? How can we sweeten this deal for you?"

"Given the job posting, I'm quite unsurprised that you're short-staffed. Let me lay out all the red flags that you have yet to address." Lucy raised a hand, putting down a finger with each subsequent offense.

"One. There is no HR department."

"Well, yes, we are all-powerful gods who require no overseers - "

"Two. My office is a cold wasteland of eternal darkness."

"Hey, now, that's not *entirely* true, there's the Asphodel meadows and the fields of Elysium - "

"Three. I will have absolutely no opportunities for career growth."

"Isn't that a *good* thing? You're getting hired in at the highest possible level!"

"I'm just saying, Zeus," Lucy tapped a finger on the large wooden desk. "You don't have a lot of bargaining power here."

"Alright, *Lucy*," Zeus slammed his thunderbolt on the floor, and the room shook. "If you have so many complaints with the job, why did you even bother applying, then? There are thousands of other applicants for me to choose from. Don't waste my time." 

This, in fact, was completely false, but Zeus had no intention of admitting it.

"Well, see, I have an offer for you," Lucy replied. "I have a few other friends who are out of work. What if we made this a part time position? Say, 6 hours a day, with two days off a week."

"Only six hours a day?" Zeus's eyebrows shot to the top of his forehead. "Girl, do you know  how many hours *I* work?" 

Lucy shrugged offhandedly. "Hey, just because you had it bad doesn't mean all of us should. And by the way, I fully expect a referral bonus for every friend that I bring in."
