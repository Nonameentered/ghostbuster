Crowley tapped his fingers twice on the green velvet. "Check."

"This seat taken?"

"No, go for it," he replied, gesturing towards the open chair. "But I thought you lot weren't supposed to be at places like this."

"Haven't you heard the news?" Aziraphale effortlessly slid down beside him, and nodded at the dealer. "We're taking a break from all of that. A little 'sabbatical', you know? And don't call us 'you lot', you know that we're all the same deep down, just happened to pick different sides way back when."

Crowley snorted. "I highly doubt that this sabbatical's been approved by Upper Management."

"Oh, all right, perhaps I've taken a few liberties with our leave policy," Aziraphale conceded. "But never mind that. How do you play?"

"What, poker? Are you telling me you sat down without knowing how to play?" Bending up his two cards, Crowley peeked at his hand. Pocket kings. Perfect.

Aziraphale took a look at his own cards, and bounced nervously in his chair. "Well, company policy and all that. Like you said, I haven't been permitted to enter these types of establishments in many a century."

Looking the angel up and down, Crowley had to admit that Aziraphale looked like a complete and utter fish. Stuck out like a sore thumb with his dapper white suit and cheery grin. Already, Crowley spotted two or three potential card sharks gravitating towards the table, smelling the blood in the water.

Crowley cocked his head. Actually, the poker players advancing toward the table looked quite familiar. If only he could put his finger on it...

With a sudden shock, Crowley had the feeling that one gets when they see their coworkers outside of the office for the first time.

"Hastur? What the devil are you doing here?"

"Actually, we're here because he's not," Hastur replied in a gravelly voice. "Not sure if it makes any difference to you, slacker that you are, but we're on strike. We're sick of fighting Satan's battles for him. He and God can just iron it out."

"Golly," Crowley said. "Lower Management's probably got their panties in a twist. Wait. I thought *you* were part of Lower Management, Beelzebub?"

"Not anymore, I'm not," the winged creature hissed in reply. "More responsibility and work for a shitty pay raise? Count me out. Is this seat taken?" It raised a claw towards the chair besides Crowley.

"Be my guest," Crowley pulled out a chair for the formerly Second-in-command of the Nether Regions.

Three hours later, and Richard was *certain* that there was something strange going on at Table 5. Half of the players were wearing bizarre costumes, which altogether wasn't all that unusual given his normal clientele, but for some reason, the individuals at the table never seemed to run out of money, no matter how much they lost.

For example, Richard was sure that the stately man in white had bled over two hundred thousand dollars in chips. However, his jolly manner was completely and wholly unaffected by his incalculable losses. The figure that seemed to be a swarm of locusts underneath a trench-coat kept trying to play with replica coins from the 16th century. And the man with the sunglasses who was on a 43-game winning streak was *probably* cheating, but Richard could not for the life of him figure out how.

Shrugging, Richard shuffled the deck, preparing to deal another round. At least they tipped their dealer well.
