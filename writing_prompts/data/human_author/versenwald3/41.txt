The pedicurist clears her throat, interrupting Death's existential musings. "So, are you new in town? I haven't seen you before."

The woman is going to die by the end of the day. Death can smell it in the air. Even though Death is mortal for the day, some of her powers still cling to her, unwilling to let go.

Death smiles sunnily at her, glancing down at the garish bright yellow nametag. "Guessed it right, Suzanna! Just here on vacation, leaving at the end of tonight. Think I'm going to check out No Relation - I've heard their omakase is to die for."

Perhaps the pun is in bad taste, but hey, it's not like the woman's going to know about it until it's too late, right?

Death used to pity them. Back when she was a little more naive, she tried to warn them. *That* hadn't worked out so well. Sometimes, she thought the Man Upstairs was a bit of a sadist. 

Why give Death a corporeal body, give her a chance to actually make a *difference*, and then forbid her from changing anyone's mortal coil? Sure, sure, *order* was important and all that. There were *greater powers* that controlled the turning of the Universe, and if Suzanna was to die by the end of the day, well, die she must.

Checking her watch, Death straightens up and smiles, leaving Suzanna a generous tip. Picking up her Prada purse (borrowed from a plastic mannequin's arm - she'll return it at the end of the day), she walked out towards the sushi spot where she's meeting Life at 4 PM.

Life's a little bit more of a stickler for the Man Upstairs's rules, but Life also has a weak spot for negitoro and sake. She's probably spent the day at a hospital, making sick kids smile or playing babies or some bullshit like that.

Death has had enough of hospitals. She doesn't need to go to one on her day off.
