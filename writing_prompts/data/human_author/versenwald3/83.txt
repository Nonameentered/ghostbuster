"Marshall, you're being childish." Andrea planted her hands on her hips, giving me the side-eye.

"Oh, am I?" I taunted her gleefully, sidestepping the vines that blossomed out of the hard concrete, grasping for my ankles. "Well, at least I'm having fun while doing it. You won't *believe* what I've got planned next."

Activating my rocket boosters, I soared off in the direction of city hall. The EMP bomb was strapped to my back, and in my fingers I held the trigger. With a single click, I'd be able to disable the electricity in a 30-mile radius of New York City.

"Is this about the time that I didn't go to your tea party? I'm sorry, you know." She sounded exasperated.  "But some of us have *real* responsibilities. Like saving the city."

I paused in midair, turning back towards her. "It was my tenth birthday party! And if you weren't going to come, you could have at least changed your RSVP."

"Marshall, the city mayor called me on the hotline saying that Inferno was going to burn down the hospital. I didn't have *time* to change my RSVP." Wings blossomed from her back, and she drew closer to me. "Mom would have been *so* disappointed in you. Get back here this moment."

Her big-sister voice hadn't worked on me for a long time. As I powered up my rocket once more, I grinned. For the first time in many years, I had Andrea's full attention, and it was time to play tag.
