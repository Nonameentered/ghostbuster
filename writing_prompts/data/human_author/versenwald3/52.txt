**Day 4:**

It had been a rough couple of nights. 

I knew I was in it for the long haul after two hours of searching for the mythical bakery section. I had decided to give up - Rhonda was probably frantic, wondering where I'd gone. Best to find the exit and leave.

It only took five minutes for me to realize that the bright red EXIT signs led me in a perfect circle. Retracing my steps was impossible - those automatic doors that I entered through were nowhere to be found. 

I hadn't been able to tell whether it was night or day - as hard as I tried, I could not get to a side of the supermarket that bordered the outside world, and therefore, I saw no windows. My iPhone ran out of battery, and there was no way to know what time it was. I hunkered down in the prepared foods section, huddling near the heated entrees for warmth. At least there was no shortage of food, here.

Today, I saw the first sign of something different. A string of sausage, snaking its way through the labyrinthine aisles. Following it, I met a man. Marcus. He wasn't sure how long he'd been in here, only that when he'd first come inside, he'd been cleanly shaven. 

He had quite a full beard, now, and I could only guess that he had been trapped for at least a fortnight. Marcus had been trying to trace his path, using the sausage to mark the places where he'd been. A clever idea, one which I wish I'd thought of myself. 

Marcus and I decided that we'd band together to find our way out of this strange hellscape. Perhaps we'd find others to join our ragtag team.
