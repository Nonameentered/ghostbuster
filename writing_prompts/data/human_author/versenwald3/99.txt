It was a cold and grey night. The weak light of the street lamps painted ghostly shadows on the cobblestones. In the abandoned outskirts of the city, a decrepit house stood proudly on its rotting foundations.

There was a knock on the door.

Briana looked up from her plans. There weren't many humans left in the city. Perhaps a few survivors had seen the lights on in her study, but still, it would be good to exercise a healthy dose of caution. Before opening the door, she peered through the peephole and spotted two hooded figures on her doorstep.  The two looked familiar, though she could not quite place why.

The taller of the two stepped forward. "Briana, of House Bowman," he said. "Though our brethren have not always been on the best of terms, we are desperate. We seek refuge from you."

Smirking, Briana opened the door in full. "The great Alucard. I've heard stories about you and your kind all my life. How can I possibly help you?"

There was a pained groan from Alucard. "Please, Miss Bowman. I have stooped so low as to ask my mortal enemy for aid. Spare me your sarcasm. We are asking you for refuge, for sanctuary. And perhaps, once we have recovered, we may be able to help in the battle against the - "

Cutting him off, Briana put a hand on her hip. "Recovered, my ass. My Nana always told me how creatures of the night could never be trusted. Do tell me, what's going to stop you from draining me dry once I let you in and you've 'recovered'?"

"Please." The other figure had been silent so far, but now she stepped forward, pulling her hood down. With skin the color of bleached bone and cheekbones sharp enough to draw blood, Elena looked exactly the way the Nana had described her. "We never wanted to rid the world of mortals, but the Mindless Ones do. If humanity perishes, so do we. It is in our best interest to work together."

Briana considered her request. "And what if I refuse?"

"Then our kind will be no more," Elena replied. "We are the last of our brethren. The others have all been consumed."

Far off in the distance, there was an otherworldly screech. Alucard flinched. Elena shivered. 

Briana was tempted to let the two of them die on her doorstep, but they were right. For the past three hundred years, House Bowman had traditionally hunted the vampires. But her family's true calling was to protect humanity, and now, there were bigger fish to fry.

"Fine." Briana took a deep breath, steeling herself. "On behalf of the Bowman family, I cordially invite the two of you inside."
