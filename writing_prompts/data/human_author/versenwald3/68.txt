Joyce planted her hands on her hips. "Excuse me, who are *you* to say I'm dull?"

The purple-skinned alien tugged at the larger alien's tentacles. "Dr. Zogads, Dr. Zogads, look! This one said something!"

The larger alien slithered over to the glass, peering myopically through a pair of spectacles. "Hm. What a surprise. Most of them simply faint away or start babbling incoherently. Perhaps this one is not so dull after all."

"Hello? I can *hear* you. Talk about rude." Joyce looked around the spaceship, full of blinking lights and signs written in an incomprehensible language. She wondered if this involuntary excursion would take up one of her sick days. Or *worse*, one of her floating holidays.

"Yes, yes, my apologies." The purple-skinned alien warbled in a very unapologetic tone. "It's just that ever since we began studying humanity, the lot of you seem to have become more and more *boring* over time. Stable 9-5s locked in an office cubicle, running errands on the weekend, et cetera. Where's the *adventure*? Where's the *excitement*?"

"First of all, there's nothing *wrong* with stability," Joyce replied sharply. "I'm forty-four with two children, I want to settle down and have a good life, not stay out snorting cocaine and partying 24/7. If you wanted excitement, maybe you should have abducted someone from a nightclub."

"Second of all, just because I have a nice life does *not* make me dull. In fact, I think the two of you are rather dull. You're studying alien species and all you can do is make shallow judgements about how interesting they are. I have *hobbies*. I have *dreams*. And in the first thirty seconds of meeting me, all you can say is 'Damn it, another dull one?' You should be ashamed of yourselves!"

The smaller alien looked at its feet, flushing a dark royal purple. The larger of the two aliens, Dr. Zogads, Joyce hazarded, stretched out a single tentacle.

"As Ammail said, he apologizes for his hasty judgement. When we encounter nearly identical forms of your species day in and day out, it is easy to generalize and look no further than the surface."

"That's no excuse."

"You are right. ....Joyce, was it? Now come. Perhaps you can tell us more about your hobbies. And your dreams. And perhaps then, we will gain a better understanding of what it means to be human."
