"Didn't think I'd be back, didja?" Spiritus blew a raspberry at me, and I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to block out his distracting hijinks.

"I got rid of you for a reason, and it was a good one, okay? How am I supposed to destroy the world if I've got a godsblasted *conscience* nagging at me 24/7?" I swatted a hand at him, but it went straight through his incorporeal form.

"Well, maybe you oughter go to therapy. Your friends kept telling you that, dinnit they?"

"I don't *have* friends," I ground out through my teeth. "Not anymore, at least."

"Got sick of you, I bet," Spiritus sang out as he did a lazy loop-de-loop. "All that doom and gloom and 'nothing is worth saving, let me destroy it all.' Probably wore on their nerves. Hell, I'm part of you, and I was getting sick of it too!"

I fiddled with my doomsday device, trying to start the countdown timer. "So why are you here, then? Sod off. Go and find someone less doom and gloom."

"Well, somebody's got to stop you, I reckon. And since you've got nobody else left, I figure it might as well be me. At this rate, you're going to rack up so much negative karma that I'll never get reincarnated. Or I'll get reincarnated into an apocalyptic wasteland. And lemme tell you, escapin' hell was a *doozy*. Wouldn't want to have gone through all that just to end up as some radioactive roach living in the middle of nowhere."

"There!" I connected the last wire and wiped the sweat out of my eyes. "Ten minutes left, and then humanity will be wiped out of existence forever. If you're here to stop me, you're doing a pretty terrible job, Spiritus."

"Excuse me?"

"What *now*?" I whirled around to face the newcomer, a small red imp with batlike wings.

"Ah, yes, Dr. Danger? I'm Malice. Assistant Auditor to his Evilness. You made a contract with Asmodeus two weeks ago?"

"Correct," I rolled my eyes. "I signed away my soul for enough uranium to annihilate the entire world. What do you want?"

"Well," the imp clucked its tongue. "It appears that your soul is no longer under the possession of Asmodeus. As such, your contract is null and void, and we will be reclaiming all the goods you received as part of the contract."

"What? It's not my fault you couldn't hang on to my soul!" I yelled.

"It's in the terms and conditions, didn't you read them?" Malice cleared its throat obnoxiously and began to read. "In the unlikely event that ifsoever an errant soul manages to escape the depths of hell, the contract with its owner is immediately rendered null and void."
