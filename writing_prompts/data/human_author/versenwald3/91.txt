"You want me to just sit with her?" Strak's three sets of eyebrows furrowed in confusion.

Azog the Indomitable nodded. "Yes. And maybe a little more than that. You know, sing 'Happy Birthday', blow out candles, gossip about drama at school."

"And then you will return me to the *Cetus*?" Though Azog was not known for his mercy or his benevolence, he was a man of his word. If Azog told Strak that he would be returned to his starship, Strak knew that by nightfall, he would see his fellow crew mates once more.

"Yes. And then I will set you free. However," the warlord added, taking a step towards Strak, "your performance must be convincing. You cannot do this halfheartedly. If you do not make her smile, I do not care what value you may have as a hostage. I *will* destroy you."

Chills ran down Strak's spine. "I will do my best not to disappoint, sir," he replied.

"Good. I must return to the bridge, but I will be watching," Azog inclined his head towards the camera installed in the ceiling, then briskly marched away.

Approaching the table where Trella sat, Strak smiled gamely at her. "I'm told by your father it's a *very* special day for you," he opened.

Trella looked up at him. For someone who had nobody to celebrate her eleventh birthday with, she didn't look all that sad, Strak thought.

"Don't worry, you don't need to pretend to be nice to me," the girl replied. Strak was taken aback by how mature she sounded. No eleven-year-old should be *this* world-weary already.

"My name is Strak," he plowed ahead determinedly. "And I'm here to celebrate your birthday with you!"

"Really, you can stop pretending," Trella said. "He did the same thing to me last year. I'll smile, so you can drop the act." She grinned cheerily in the direction of the camera.

Strak felt a pang in his circulatory organs. "I'm sorry. It must be difficult, being the daughter of the most fearsome warlord in the Omega YY sector of the galaxy."

Turning back towards Strak, Trella sighed. "Tell me about it. I can't even be upset none of the other kids came. If I made a big fuss, he'd probably execute all their parents or something ridiculous."
