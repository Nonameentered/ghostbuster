"Well, you're, you know-" the man stuttered incoherently, gesticulating wildly with his hands.

"I'm afraid I don't understand. What do you mean, 'you know'?"

"You know, well,  you've got all those strange squiggly bits. And tentacles. And so many eyes. I'm not really sure where to look."

"My prime eye is directly beneath the mouth that looks like a yawning void, not the mouth lined with razor-sharp teeth. If you need to choose somewhere to look, look there."

"Yes, well, I'd rather not look, if it's all the same to you. In fact, I would really rather you put me back down so that I may continue running away, senselessly screaming my lungs out."

"That seems like rather a waste of energy. After all, if I'd wanted to hurt any of you, you certainly all would be dead by now."

"I don't think you understand. You don't need to *intend* any harm. It's part of what you are. I can feel my brains melting as I speak with you right now. In fact, they seem to be oozing out of my ears."

"Human, I don't have any control over what I am. It seems rather *rude* to judge a creature based off of things outside of their control."
