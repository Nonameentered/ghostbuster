Death sipped on his margarita. Sometimes, it was nice to get away from it all.

After the whole debacle with Miss Flitworth, he'd learned a few things. Namely, it was this - mortals with regular 9-5 jobs got vacations. Sure, he was an immortal personification of a nebulous concept who needed to reap souls 24/7 or risk disrupting the balance of the universe. But he'd spent an eternity doing his thankless job. For just one day, the universe and balance could go sod off.

Death needed some me time, and he sure as hell was going to take it. And besides, it wasn't as though Upper or Lower Management could do anything about it. Technically, he didn't even have a boss to answer to.

"Excuse me, is everything to your liking, sir?" A neatly dressed waiter, his uniform beginning to soak through with sweat in the balmy 90-degree heat, leaned towards Death, plucking the two empty glasses off of the nearby table.

YES. WELL, ACTUALLY...

Death hesitated for a moment, craning his cervical vertebrae as he peered around, perusing the other drinks the other beachgoers were tasting.

COULD I GET ONE WITH A TINY UMBRELLA?

Somewhere else, it was Invincibility Day.

The funny thing about Invincibility Day was that nobody was quite sure when exactly it started. Nobody wanted to be the foolish bloke who broke his neck testing it out, so instead, the holiday was always tentatively announced when the entirety of the United States hospital systems reported no deaths for over two hours.

Naturally, USA hospitals were absolute rubbish at communicating between themselves, what with administrators struggling with timezones and doctors forgetting to send emails. As a result, Invincibility Day always actually started five to six hours after the fact.

Thrill-seekers waited 364 days a year for this particular day. Travel agents eagerly anticipated the flood of clients, as they were always inundated with last-second bookings for whitewater rafting and rock climbing expeditions.

Unfortunately, people were equally uncertain as to when Invincibility Day ended. Most travel agents hesitated to book anything more than twelve hours after the start of Invincibility Day. Those who did were always excruciatingly careful with the wording of their safety waivers. Even so, if a client died on their watch, no amount of waivers could erase the black stain of a one-star review from a disgruntled relative.

Still, twenty-one hours after the start of the tenth Invincibility Day, Leonard Lewis was determined to achieve his goal.
