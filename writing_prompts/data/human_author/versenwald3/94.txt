The heels of the man's well-polished shoes clicked against the marble floor as he strode evenly towards the counter.

Behind the kiosk, the cashier bowed his head in greeting. "Asmodeus. A pleasure to see you back here."

"Yanluo." The voice clawed its way out from the back of the man's throat, scratchy from disuse. "We are here to make a withdrawal."

The being known as Yanluo nodded politely. "Of course, sir. However, I regret to inform you that another withdrawal from your current holdings will cause you to drop below our minimum required balance. If you make this transaction, you will be charged a fee for falling below the quota."

Asmodeus exploded, blanketing the air with a murky purple miasma. The dark cloud of gas pulsated with arcane energy, and when the being spoke again, his voice echoed from all corners of the room. "Gathering souls is no simple task, you glorified accountant. We insist you waive this minimum balance requirement. *Or else*.”

Yanluo sighed. “Sir, when you opened a balance here, you signed the Contract of Binding. If you threaten myself or my establishment, I have the right to eject you from the premises. Additionally, you will forfeit your ownership of all deposits. Would you like to repeat your earlier sentiments?”

Instead of deflating, the purple cloud of gas expanded in size, puffing itself up to fill the large hall. “WE,” Asmodeus proclaimed, “WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOUR MANAGER.”

Combing back his thinning hair, Yanluo sighed again. “Asmodeus, I have told you this time and time again. I *am* the manager. This is your final warning.”

The noxious cloud condensed into a translucent purple figure that was a rough approximation of the man it had been before. The edges of the figure smoked and unfurled, leaving an indistinct impression of where Asmodeus began and ended. The being’s face curled into a forced smile that was all teeth.

“We would like to take out a loan.”
