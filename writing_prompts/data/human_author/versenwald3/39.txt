The name's Abby. Abby McQuinn. Private detective, at your service. I've been in this business for more than six years, and yes, somehow I'm still here.

I've watched dozens of  greenhorns arrive fresh and bright-eyed, excited to be their own bosses. Most of them slink back to the regular 9-5 grind with their tails tucked between their legs after a few months.

What can I say? It's not an easy life. You've got to be able to devote your all to the case. And I don't mean to brag, but I'm *good* at what I do.

Think your man's visiting a side piece every time he goes on those "business trips"? Want to know if the cute girl you're chatting to on Bumble is actually a basement-dwelling catfish? Need to find a key witness who's suddenly gone missing?

I'm your gal.

Now, I know how word on the street gets out. If you're good at your job, happy customers tell their friends. Their friends give you some good business, and if they're happy, they tell *their* friends. And so on and so forth, until everybody on the block is coming to you for their jobs.

I hadn't realized my name had gotten to the big kahuna, though. At least, not until the Archangel Gabriel showed up at my door.
