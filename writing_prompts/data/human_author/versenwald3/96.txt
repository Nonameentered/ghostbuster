"Dad?" I rubbed my eyes in disbelief. He was still there, exactly the same as how I remembered him - though maybe the beer belly had gotten a little larger, the dark circles under his eyes a little more sunken.

He sheepishly rubbed the back of his balding head. "Hey, boyo, hadn't meant for you to find out this way. I was going to tell you, I promise."

"When? When were you going to tell me?" As my initial surprise faded, the decades-old anger of abandonment quickly surfaced. "Right after you 'bought your cigarettes'? Yeah, right."

"Look," my dad, the angel of the bottomless pit, said. "Things were complicated. There were secrets that I couldn't tell your mother. Or you. I wanted to keep you both safe."

"Bullshit." My hands were shaking, but I picked up some of the lamb's intestines near the summoning circle and threw them at his face. "You didn't give a shit about keeping us safe. You ran away. You didn't leave any explanation. I think it took me two months to realize that you weren't ever going to come back. Hell, I'm surprised at how you're the 'Prince of Darkness' and all that, if you're so bad at responsibilities. You shouldn't be any kind of leadership position at all."

He deftly dodged the viscera and raised his hands in a placating manner. "I'm here now, aren't I son? Doesn't that count for anything?"

I rolled my eyes. He was here because I had dragged him out of the Infernal Realm with a summoning spell that was impossible to circumvent. He literally hadn't had any other option but to obey. But his question reminded me of the greater danger that awaited. "Alright, dad." The word sounded funny in my mouth after so many years of disuse. "Or Lucifer? The Morningstar? What do I call you?"

"Dad is fine," he replied, smiling sadly at me. I ignored the tug on my heartstrings. He didn't deserve to be forgiven so easily.

"Actually, no, I don't think I'm ready to call you dad yet," I replied. "Anyways, Lucifer. Let's set our differences aside for now. I'm sure that you know the world is in danger - we'll deal with that first."
