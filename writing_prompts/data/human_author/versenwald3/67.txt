Addison woke up, brushed her teeth, and drove to work. Luckily, she'd been able to deduce her workplace by looking at the past GPS destinations on her phone. Funny, how Siri was able to remember more than she could.

It was the first day she was going back to work after the incident. She couldn't remember much from before then, but she knew that whatever her team was trying to conceal from the public was highly confidential. *Incredibly* confidential. So confidential that there was absolutely no documentation that described what they were working on. At least, no documentation that wasn't hidden behind some sort of extremely-encrypted, two-factor authorization enabled, security software.

They had been testing a new memory-wiping technology. There had been a few witnesses of the Event, and the government wanted all traces of it wiped from human memory. She remembered watching through the one-way glass as the volunteer was strapped to the chair, seeing Dr. Rivendale's thumbs-up to her, and pushing the button that emitted the electromagnetic pulses.

And then....nothing. She'd woken up in the hospital. A strange man in a dark-blue suit had come to visit her. He'd asked a lot of questions. Questions about whether anyone else knew about Dr. Rivendale's research, questions about whether there had been a leak about the Event, questions about whether she felt ready to go back to leading the team.

She'd lied. Apparently, she'd lied quite well.  After the assessment, the man told her to take a week off and then come back to work when she felt ready.

Scanning her badge against the door, Addison strode into the facility. She schooled her features into a mask of indifference. Nothing should surprise her. After all, she had worked here for the last ten years. At least, that was what the start date listed on her ID badge implied.

A young fellow sitting at the cluster of cubicles next to the door nearly jumped out of his chair. "Oh! Hello! Welcome back."

"Thank you," Addison smiled, squinting at his small badge. Really, someone should have made the print larger when they were designing these.  "...Jackson. How was your weekend?"

"Oh, it was wonderful, you know. Did some errands, then just hung out at home. Very relaxing. What about you?"

"Good, good."

There was an awkward pause. Addison cleared her throat.

"So, how goes work this fine morning?"

"I'm just searching the internet for potential leaks. About the thing. The thing we're supposed to be covering up." Jackson replied. He was a *little* too overeager, Addison thought. And sweat stains were starting to appear on his starched white shirt.

"Oh? And could you remind me again? What's the thing that we're supposed to be covering up?"

"A-ah, well, you know, that's highly confidential. I'm afraid I can't say that out loud. Perhaps you can check the project briefings on the server?"

Addison smirked. That was quite quick thinking on Jackson's part. "That makes sense. Why don't you log into the server for me?" Leaning to look over at his screen, she was surprised to see a screen filled with gray squares and colorful numbers.

"I thought you were investigating potential leaks, Jackson." Raising an eyebrow, Addison pointed at the monitor. "This looks like minesweeper to me."

"W-well," Jackson fidgeted, looking around nervously. "You see, I need to log into Cisco AnyConnect to get an internet connection here. But I don't remember my username. Or my password. I called the number listed for the IT department, but they don't seem to have me on file as an employee."

"I see," Addison replied, thoughts whirling furiously in her head.

"Honestly?" Jackson lowered his voice to a whisper. "I'm not sure what we do. Or who you are. I *especially* don't remember what we're even trying to cover up."

Grinning, Addison patted Jackson on the back. "Sounds like a congratulations is in order. It seems like we've successfully covered up whatever we were supposed to cover up."

To the Bureau of Secrecy,

It appears that you have successfully completed your objective. You wanted to erase all memories of the Event, including the memories of those who were employed to cover up the event. The pulse wave was able to obliterate all instances of said memory in the entire facility.

Now, nobody can remember what the details of the Event, including myself. However, I would like to say that your ethics are highly questionable. Memory modification, without consent of the participants, is Machiavellian at best and psychopathic at worst. Had I known that you had magnified my experimental setup to affect everyone in a 5-mile radius, I certainly would have objected. 

Since I have absolutely no proof or even concrete memory of what we were trying to cover up, I cannot bring this evidence to the authorities (after all, aren't you one of the authorities?), so unfortunately, I must settle for this admonishing missive.

\--Dr. Jacob X. Rivendale
