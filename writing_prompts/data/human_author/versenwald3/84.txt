"Hello? Anyone in here?" Damian knocked on the door. A nice little nametag affixed to the front of the door proclaimed that this was the office of a Dr. C. Anderson. Damian hoped that Dr. C Anderson was still practicing. The other five offices that he had gone to had been...disappointing, to say the least.

A low, unearthly, growl emanated from within, and Damian flinched back. That wasn't promising.

Nevertheless, he had to try.

Slowly opening the door, he was greeted with a scene straight out of a slasher movie. The bodies of two zombies lay in the corner, one with a shotgun wound through its head. The other was bleeding profusely from a wound in its side, and was the source of the groaning noise.

Damian's eyes lit up. The third person in the room who was holding the shotgun was wearing a white coat. They still appeared to be breathing. And the coat was monogrammed neatly with a name: *Dr. C. Anderson*.

"I-I've been bitten," the doctor moaned. "It's too late for me, son. Go, run away! Save yourself before I turn."

"No," Damian replied.

The doctor paused with the dramatics, confusion written all over his face. "No?"

"No," Damian repeated firmly. "It takes, what, four hours to turn? No, I need you to do this for me first."

"What could possibly be worth the risk?" the doctor asked. "You *are* aware that I am a orthodontist, not a surgeon, correct?"

Damian grimaced, displaying his neon-green braces. "Do you have any idea what it feels like to have the same piece of disgusting jerky stuck in your braces for two weeks straight? No, doctor. This is *absolutely* worth the risk."
