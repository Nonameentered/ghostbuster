Staring into the mirror, Veera carefully painted the last of the 12 sigils onto her forehead. Her fingers were steady as they traced the triangles and circles, vivid red against her pale skin.

Everything was ready.

The last ten years of her life, she'd been training, studying, delving further and deeper into the forbidden arts, consumed with the thought of gaining more power.

The trade that she would perform tonight would be the culmination of her life's work.

Sure, she would lose her soul and her humanity.

But finally, she would have her revenge.

Taking a deep breath, she turned away from the mirror and approached the painstakingly-drawn chalk pentagram on her dingy apartment floor. She lit the five flickering candles, knowing that soon, there would be no turning back.

Settling down into the circle in a cross-legged position, Veera closed her eyes and spoke the arcane words of summoning, shivering as she felt the ancient power begin to stir.

"*You who are bound to servitude, I break the bonds that imprison you. You who have been sentenced to an eternity on the Other Plane, I freely offer you this vessel with which to walk this earthly realm. N'gorso the Mighty, I call upon you."*

Alone in the room, Veera waited.

The minutes ticked by, the cuckoo clock excruciatingly loud in the deafening silence. The light in the darkened room began to flicker as the candles burned down to nubs. Had she made a mistake?

No.

In the back of her mind, Veera felt a presence. Someone else was here.

*N'gorso?*

**Uh. Yes. Hello.**

*I freely offer you this mortal vessel. In exchange, I ask for the power to destroy the ones who murdered my family.*

**Er, thanks. Really appreciate it.**

There was an awkward silence. Veera valiantly resisted the temptation to nibble at her fingernails. Was this how demon possessions were *supposed* to work? Nobody had ever described what the process was like, because, well, everyone who had successfully done it never came back from the other side.

**Um...**

*Yes?*

There was another protracted silence, and Veera began to wonder if she had made an irreversible mistake.

*What is it?*

**I'm sorry. This is sort of my first time doing this and I'm not too sure how to move your body. Do you have an instruction manual?**
