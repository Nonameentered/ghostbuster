Death lay back in the luxurious massage chair, feeling the tension seep out of her exhausted shoulders. At her feet, the pedicurist shaved off months of long hard travel, massaging her toes in the rose-scented water.

If she was going to be mortal for a day, she might as well enjoy it, right?

Examining her perfectly-executed French manicure, Death allowed herself a small smile. Creature comforts were probably not what the Man Upstairs had intended when he'd instituted a a single mandatory day of mortality, but hey, she was still following his orders, right? Meeting human beings, garnering empathy for them, yada yada yada.

Sometimes, she wondered how dense he could be. All of them had been human, once. No matter how many ageless years went by, you could never forget what it was like to live.

A single day of mortality was *nothing* like that. Sure, she could bleed, and feel, and *live*, and a few times, she'd even accidentally died before the day was over. It's awkward, being reaped by your own apprentice.

But after the day is over, everything is back to business as usual. Collecting souls, leading them Upstairs or Downstairs or In-Between, and explaining what happens now. Death knew what was going to happen to tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow, and the day after that. It was as set in stone as the rising of the sun.

But when you're human and facing the great unknown, you don't know what happens After. When the scythe falls, there's no going back.
