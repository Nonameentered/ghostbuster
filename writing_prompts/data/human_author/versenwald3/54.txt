I'd forgotten to buy the soy milk.

You know how it is. You're running late, and you're supposed to be hosting your friends for dinner, and all day you've been driving back and forth and back and forth from Safeway to Home Depot to Capital One to Target, and you're on your way home when your wife texts you asking if you remembered to pick up the soy milk.

Really, it was all Amanda's fault for being lactose intolerant in the first place.  I had half a mind to text back and say screw the soy milk, because there was no way I'd be able to go back to Safeway and come back in time. And that's when I saw it.

Whole Foods. Those beautiful green letters beckoned me, and without a second thought, I popped my turn signal and swung into the parking lot.

Strangely, I couldn't remember a Whole Foods ever being here. Perhaps it was new? The parking lot was crammed full of dozens of cars - maybe there was some promotional opening discounts or something. I could only hope that the self-checkout line wouldn't be too long. Grabbing a basket, I walked through the automatic front doors. As they swung shut behind me, I felt a pang of fear, though I didn't know why. My gut instinct was to run out the doors as quickly as I could, but I quickly dismissed the thought. I was just being silly. It was just a Whole Foods.

Little did I know, that was the point of no return.
