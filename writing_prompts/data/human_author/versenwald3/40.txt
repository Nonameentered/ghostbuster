"Sir, we do not accept barter. Please pay us with legal tender and we will look after your child, no problem."

**THIS IS NOT OUR CHILD. IT WAS BORN OF THE NAMELESS MISTS AND IS FATED TO BECOME THE TRUE KEY AND GUARDIAN OF THE ETERNAL GATE.**

"...I see. Are you saying that you don't have legal guardianship over this child?"

**WE ARE THE OLD ONES. WE WERE HERE BEFORE THE BEGINNING AND WILL BE HERE AFTER THE END. EVERYTHING IS OUR DOMAIN.**

"That clears everything up, then. But like I said before, we here at Sunnyside Kinder Care do not accept barter as a form of payment. Do you have anything, ah, a little more substantial?"

**I HAVE DREAMED FOR TEN THOUSAND MILLENNIA. I AM TO DREAM FOR A THOUSAND MORE, AND YET, FOR THIS SPAWN OF THE BOTTOMLESS VOID, I HAVE ROUSED MYSELF FROM MY SLUMBER. YOU WILL BE REWARDED HANDSOMELY.**

"I'm afraid our rates are posted right here on the wall, sir. Forty dollars an hour. I'm sorry you came all this way just to find that out, but you could've also checked our website before coming."

**FORTY DOLLARS AN HOUR. THAT IS HIGHWAY ROBBERY.**

"Look, I don't appreciate that insinuation, not one bit. I have a master's degree in children's education. All of us here have gotten our Level 3 NVQ certs, and we're all extremely qualified. If you're looking for a cheaper daycare, might I suggest 'Tots and Toys' down the road?"

**I AM ALL-KNOWING AND ALL-SEEING. OF COURSE I KNOW ABOUT TOTS AND TOYS. IT IS UNSATISFACTORY.**

"I see, well, if you do not want our business, I will have to ask you to kindly leave. Your presence is beginning to disturb some of the children - "

**I WILL GIVE YOU YOUR FORTY DOLLARS AN HOUR, MORTAL. BUT WHEN YOU LIE AWAKE IN BED TONIGHT, DREAMING OF SHAPELESS HORRORS, REMEMBER THAT YOU COULD HAVE HAD THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE STARS.**
