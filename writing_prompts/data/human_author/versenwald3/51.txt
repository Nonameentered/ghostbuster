"Old Pete! How's the missus doing? Have a good weekend?" I peered over poison-tipped fence, yelling at the top of my lungs. 

"Phil! Always good to see you, mate. She's doing well, we had a swell weekend, spent most of it cleaning out the moat and feeding the sharks. How about you?"

"Oh, you know, the usual - was busy catching up on payroll for the minions. Always more work to do, ain't that the truth?"

"Damn right," Pete chuckled. "And Phil, before I forget - we really appreciate the snow tiger community patrol you've established, but some of them have started relieving themselves on my petunias. Think your henchmen can do something about that?"

"I'm on it, Pete. Sorry about the petunias, Julia and I have got to have you and the missus over for dinner one of these days. I've got a lovely apology bottle of Chardonnay that's waiting for you." Doffing my hat at him, I proceeded onwards through my morning patrol. 

It was getting harder and harder to be a good neighbor these days, but hey, I still tried my best.

I've loved Piney Hills ever since I was a wee lad. Born and raised, and lived here my whole life. Inherited the house from my daddy, who got it from his daddy, who got it from his daddy's daddy. Some of these neighbors are like family to me, and I've watched many of their wailing babes grow into strapping young men.

Which is why I didn't move away when the Hero started coming.

Oh, yes, sure, he was prophesied to save the world from a terrible fate or demons or whatever. But on his travels, he would always stop by our little town of Piney Hills.

I wouldn't have minded if he'd been a good tourist. Always helps the economy to have tourists. But no, he was absolutely *terrible.*

Smashing our pots. Breaking into our homes. Stealing our family heirlooms.

I saw the neighborhood change. People I'd know for all my life moved out. I think the turning point came when Missus Brown and the rest of her family moved out to the country.

"We can't take it anymore, Phil," she'd said tearfully. "Just the other day, that *Hero* came by and took all family spellbooks. They'd been in our family for generations! And he just scooped them up without so much of a 'thank you', and stabbed little Wesley when he tried to stop him. Thank god the wound wasn't fatal, but we can't live like this anymore."

That had been the last straw. I decided it was time to take a stand.

It was time to protect Piney Hills.
