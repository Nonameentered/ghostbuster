Standing at the helm of the *Invictus*, Azog the Indomitable watched the stars whiz by.

In the span of his great career, he conquered the entire Omega YY sector, rose to the rank of supreme warlord of the Orcus Empire, explored the far reaches of the galaxy, and raised his daughter through the throes of moody preteen angst.

And that was only just the start of the list.

Altogether, he was quite satisfied. His replacement, Zimaell, was one of his own students, and Azog was quite confident that they were well-equipped to handle the stresses of being supreme commander. Throughout the years, Azog contributed generously to his 502b retirement fund, and could live comfortably off of the interest. Trella was making her own way in the world. It was time for Azog to rest easy.

And Azog was *tired.*

Oh, there had been many options for retirement. The Empire had offered him a spot on the Prime Council. Zimaell had pleaded with him to remain in the army as an advisor emeritus of sorts. There was a nice little cottage on Hoovatree III that he had been eying, just overlooking the sparkling silver beaches...

The spaceship sped on.

It had been many decades ago, now, but Azog the Indomitable never forgot the beautiful notes that his transmitter picked up in the Alpha ZZ sector.

*Almost Heaven, West Virginia*

*Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River...*

A few years after he heard the song, Alpha ZZ was deemed a primitive sector, unworthy of further investigation. Though its inhabitants had sent out many signals (mostly gibberish, in fact), they still had not managed to decrypt any of the return messages, and thus did not qualify as having made First Contact. Though the Orcus Empire was a militaristic expansionist empire, it also had *standards*.

If humanity couldn't even figure out how to open an intergalactic voicemail, they weren't worth conquering.

For thirty long years, Azog wondered what Heaven would look like.

He supposed he would be finding out soon.
