I waited for her for forty minutes before I decided that she wasn't coming. Looking down at my phone, I winced at all the messages that I'd sent her. 

*Hey, I'm here!*

*I grabbed a seat for us in the back, it's table 12, I'm wearing a blue North Face*

*Just checking, are you on your way yet?* 

*Guess you aren't coming...hope everything is okay?*

As I looked at the screen, a read receipt appeared under my most recent text. I watched nervously as three ellipses appeared. Was she still coming?

*Sorry bro, I think you have a wrong number*

I stared in disbelief at text I'd received. Our late night debates, our weekly video chats...perhaps we hadn't really had anything special. Perhaps I'd just been a way to while away the time, a distraction for when she was bored. Clearly, I mattered so little to her that she'd given me a wrong number. 

Swallowing my disappointment, I angrily opened up reddit, determined to give her a piece of my mind. 

Only to find a dozen new blinking red notifications in my inbox.

*Hey! I just got here but I don't see you?*

*Found a seat at Table 12, waiting for you. Can't wait to meet you in person!!*

*i just texted the number you gave me and it was out of service...what the hell, dude. if you weren't interested you could've just said so.*

My mind whirled with confusion as I quickly tapped out a message to her.

*The Daily Grind, right? I'm here. Table 12. Is this some kind of fucked up joke to you?*

*What are you talking about? I should be the one who's mad. I waited for you for over half an hour before I left.* 

The gears of my brain finally began to click. I'd seen something in the recent news about how we'd established communications with a parallel Earth, but I'd just brushed it off as random science news that I didn't understand.

*Are you on Earth Beta or Earth Omega?*

*Omega.*

Crap. I was on Beta.
