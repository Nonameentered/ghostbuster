"So you were *kidnapped* on your fifth birthday?" Strak had drained two cans of sugary soda and was helping himself to birthday cake. The other kids didn't know what they were missing out on. Classic chocolate buttercream that was baked to perfection. He licked some of the icing off one of his eight appendages, savoring the taste.

Trella sheepishly shrank down in her chair. "That's right. Try that for a birthday present. I'm quite a valuable hostage, and I really thought that they were here to celebrate with me. Serves me right for being so gullible." Taking a gulp of her orange soda, she smiled weakly. "So you see, I'm used to disappointments. Dad really tries his best to make my birthdays special, but it just doesn't work out."

"No, no, no." Sugar always gave Strak bad ideas, and he was starting to get the inkling of good one. Or no, a *bad* one. A *good bad* one. Whatever that meant. "You," he said, raising a trembling finger at Trella, "you are an amazing little child, and you deserve an *awesome* birthday. We are going to fix this."

"I'm already having a good time." Laughing, Trella threw a balloon at Strak's head. "This is the best birthday that I've ever had, I think."

"Well," Strak said emphatically. "We're about to make it even better. Come with me."

Grabbing Trella's hand, Strak bolted from the party room. While Azog had been talking to him, he'd been eying the escape pods nearby. The keypad for the escape pods was well-worn - probably from daily maintenance checks - and from the worn edges of the keys, Strak knew that the combination contained the numbers 0134. He just hoped that the escape pods wouldn't lock him out after too many incorrect tries.

0134. 0413. 4103.

"Damnit," Strak gasped. "We're going to get you off this spaceship. We're going to go see the Circus of Dreams on Cadus X9O, drink Choco Bubbles until your blood turns into hot cocoa, and go ride the Cheeblas at the petting zoo on Vegraturn."

"3410," Trella said. "That's the code. 3410."

For a split second, Strak hesitated. He could take an escape pod, push Trella away, and escape back to the *Cetus*.

But it was only for a split second. With a hiss, the doors of the pod opened, and Strak pulled Trella in with him.
