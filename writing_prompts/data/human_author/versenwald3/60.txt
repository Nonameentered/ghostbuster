The scene in front of Jessica was strange, but not unusual. Ever since she developed insomnia in her early twenties, she'd had the occasional bouts of sleep paralysis, with the added cherry on top of hypnopompic hallucinations. Sometimes, she'd be bound to the bed with cruel chains. Sometimes, someone - or some*thing* \- would be holding her down, preventing her from moving.

Today, it was the latter. The little demon sitting on her chest blew an obnoxious raspberry at Jessica and waved a clawed hand in front of her face.

"Ey, so I see you've finally decided to wake up. Deep sleeper, ain'tcha?"

Her vocal chords still weren't working yet. Probably because of the sleep paralysis. *Just stay calm. S*he repeated the mantra in her head, even as she felt her pulse hammering rapidly against her throat. Soon enough, her conscious mind would take over and the demon would fade away, just like a bad dream. *Exactly* like a bad dream. For that's what these little bouts of sleep paralysis were - dreams that bled over into the waking world.

"Don'tcha know it's rude to leave someone hanging? I've been sitting here for over two hours, trying all sorts of things to get you out of la la land." The demon pushed off of her, flapping its batlike wings. Jessica winced as his claws briefly dug into her chest. It was only a dream, but *damn* it was realistic.

It hovered in front of her face and made a rude gesture. "So? You gonna give me a task or what? Whaddya say you just let me go home?"

"Why are you here?" Surprised by her own response, Jessica's fingers flew unbidden to her throat. She'd never been able to speak during an episode before. And her fingers - she'd been able to move. Perhaps she'd slipped back into a lucid dream.

The demon's beady yellow eyes narrowed. "You daft or summat? You summoned me here, you blithering dimwit. Yanked me straight out of the Nine Hells, you did. Was in the middle of a nice nap, too. So whaddya want?"

"I...I want to wake up," Jessica said hoarsely.

"Aight, guv'nor. I'm on it. Just look closely at my fingers." Saying this, the demon extended a thumb and a forefinger in front of Jessica's eyes. It snapped, and Jessica flinched away.

"Bam! Done. Can I go home now?"

Jessica backed away from the demon until her spine hit the headboard of her bed. "I'm not awake. You didn't keep up the deal."

Yawning lazily, the demon examined its fingernails. "You were already awake. I just made you *more* awake. Now can I go home now?"

Suddenly, there was a loud pounding from the door. Jessica drew the blankets up around herself, futilely trying to protect herself from whatever was coming. "Who's that?"

"Oh, it's prolly one of your neighbors. Dingy little apartment, this. Terrible sound insulation, I'd expect. You wouldn't *believe* what you were able to sleep through. Wouldn't be surprised if they were in a right fit, with all the ruckus coming from your unit."
