**Day 1:**

I first realized something was strange after the first twenty minutes. It was probably the reason why I'd been so unsettled when I first walked through those front doors. I should have listened to my instincts, then. By now, it was too late.

The thing was, despite the fact that the parking lot had been chock full of cars, the Whole Foods was eerily empty. Those first twenty minutes, I walked the barren aisles without seeing any sign of another living being. It was supposed have been a quick trip - dash in, grab the soy milk, dash out.

But the dairy aisle kept on changing. At first, I wrote it off as a silly mistake. The first sign that I saw said Aisle 4, and the second sign said Aisle 20. The blasted staff probably put the signs up wrong - all I had to do was check Aisle 4 or Aisle 20, one of them would be the right one, and then I would grab the milk and be done with it.

Just to double check it was Aisle 20, I walked back to the sign I'd just seen. I rubbed my eyes. I'd read the sign wrong. Instead of Aisle 20, the sign now read Aisle ⧫︎⬥︎❖︎■︎⧫︎⍓︎.

Rhonda! She must be wondering what was taking me so long. I pulled out my phone and tapped out a short text.

*Forgot the milk. Grabbing it at Whole Foods. Be back in a bit*.

I'd check Aisle 4 first, then. I was currently on Aisle 10 - it was only 6 aisles down. It wouldn't take too long. Grimly, I headed in the right direction.

Ten minutes later, I blinked. Aisle 4 simply didn't exist. There was Aisle 3, and Aisle 5, but Aisle 4 had simply been skipped over. At the front of Aisle 3 was a sign:

**ALL AISLE FOUR ITEMS HAVE BEEN RELOCATED TO THE CHEESE SECTION BY THE BAKERY. WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE INCONVENIENCE.**

At that moment, my phone beeped.

Next to my message to Rhonda was a bright red exclamation point.

The text had never gone through.
