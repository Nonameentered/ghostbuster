Nightwing was hot on my tail, and gaining fast. I ducked into a random alleyway, hoping that I would be able to lose her in the confusing twists and turns of Ebonborough's streets. But there was no such luck to be had. A brick wall towered before me. A dead end. And to top it all off, there was a cute little clothesline decorated with someone's lacy underthings.

"Inferno!"

I whirled around to face Nightwing. There would be no rescue from this, no hero to save me. In fact, the hero was standing right in front of me, ready to clap me in chains and cart me off to the Ebonborough Penitentiary.

How did I get to this point, you might ask?

Well, it all started with a bad case of the Mondays.

The Dirkenshire report was late, and Bruce was on my back about it, as he always was. Reports were always running late, and he *knew* that, but for some reason, he would always get extra pissy and shouty when mine weren't on time. After thirty minutes of being told to *hone my time management skills* in a much less diplomatic manner, I'd decided I deserved a treat.

I've always loved popcorn. It's got to be popcorn that's freshly popped - don't give me any of your nasty pre-popped bagged popcorn. I had a whole stack of Act IIs and Pop Secrets stashed within the third drawer of my desk, and I whipped one out and headed off to the microwave, intent on cheering myself with a little snack.

Now, I've burned popcorn before, but I've never seen it *explode*. The entire west wing of the building burnt down, Bruce ended up in the third-degree unit, and I was miraculously unscathed. Now, I know it sounds bad. But I swear, I didn't do it on purpose!

City watch put out a wanted sign with my beautiful mug on it, and every 2-bit superhero and bounty hunter in town zeroed in. I was officially a wanted villain, all because of a bag of popcorn.

The first bounty hunter I met was Vigilance. He'd caught me at my house, when I was packing all my stuff and getting ready to flee the country. Cocked a gun at me.

A gun!

I didn't even have any weapons. I wasn't even a threat. I put my hands up, and he must've thought I was conjuring some weird superpowers because he  freaked out and decided to shoot.

Good thing the gun jammed. Thing blew up.

What? No, I'm not a *monster.* Of course I checked to make sure Vigilance was still breathing before I fled the scene!

Those shenanigans doubled the price on my head.

One thing led to another, and now, I was standing with my back against a hard brick wall while Nightwing closed in on me.

"Inferno!" Nightwing yelled as she strode towards me, eyes blazing.

Great. Apparently I was worthy of a supervillain title.

Her gaze flicked upwards at the lacy underthings, then back down at me. Her scowl deepened.

"I see that you're also a pervert in addition to being a villain," she muttered.

"Hey, now, I just ducked into a random alley," I protested.

She ignored me, stalking ever closer. "If you come with me peacefully, you'll be able to live out the rest of your miserable life in Ebonborough Penitentiary. If you don't..." Her fists began glowing with ominous dark energy.

"I'll come, I'll come!" I stretched out my hands towards her in a show of defeat. "Here, tie me up. I won't resist."

"What?" Nightwing cocked her head. She probably suspected a trick.

"Seriously. Just take me to jail. People have been trying to murder me over a bag of popcorn. I'm over it."

**JAILBREAK AT EBONBOROUGH PENITENTIARY!**

**Readers may recall that three weeks ago, the nefarious Inferno was arrested by Nightwing herself, defender of Ebonborough. He was imprisoned inside the highly-secure Ebonborough Penitentiary, located on an unnamed remote island in the middle of the Askalit Ocean. Unfortunately, it seems that he allowed himself to be captured in order to engineer a jailbreak for his fellow villains.**

**Reports from eyewitnesses are mixed, but some say that they saw a massive volcanic eruption occur from a nearby island, covering the facility in ash and lava. Remarkably, nobody was injured, but the lava melted away several of the walls that held prisoners in, allowing their escape.**

**Inferno was last seen floating away on a small pumice island that had been created from the cooled lava. James Park, one of the few guards who witnessed his escape, quotes Inferno's strange victory phrase as the following:** **"Oh bollocks!".**
