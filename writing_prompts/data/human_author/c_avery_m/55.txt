The knight edged forward carefully, keeping his footing balanced. The fog swirled around his sword as he leapt forward to strike the mage before they could call forth another spell. As he swung, he was blinded by a bright flash from the mage and found himself on the ground with a throbbing skull.

"Did you not see the six foot stick I was carrying?" The mage stood over him, pinning his sword hand to the ground with their staff. The knight felt a creeping paralyzation preventing his movement.

"Dirty mage. You can blind and paralyze me with your spells but my pure heart gives me the strength of ten men!" The knight's heart was not particularly pure. His breath was definitely not pure, still smelling of last night's ale. His skin was decidedly not pure. It was worse than the breath. He hadn't bathed in several days and his armor could probably use a few days of airing out.

"I didn't use any spells on you. A stick to the head is blinding enough. Also I'm not a mage. I'm a monk. See?" The mage pointed at their neck. "My robe has a hood. Mages wear hats. Well— some monks wear hats, but they look totally different from mage hats. Did they not teach you any of this in knight school?"

The knight sat up on the ground as the monk stepped back. "Um— I went to night knight school. Most of the time was spent on swords and dragons and damsels. They mostly just covered the robes aspect on mages. With this magical fog I just assumed..."

"Yeah, this is normal fog." The monk leaned down and held a hand out for the knight, pulling him to his feet. After checking his eyes for concussion, they helped dust off the knight's armor. "Did this armor belong to your great grandfather or something?"

"No, I bought it from the school. Well— leased it. I still have to make the last twelve payments. It was expensive, but they said it was essential for all new knights to have proper armor. I'll make back the money with the first dragon I slay."

"This part on the back isn't even metal. It's just painted wood. A dragon will go right through that." The monk knocked their staff against the knight's backplate, giving off a dull thud. "If anything the paint makes it more flammable."

The knight squared up his shoulders and stood tall, wincing only slightly when his neck straightened. "All the more reason not to turn my back on a dragon. Besides, they said it was enchanted. NOT by a mage. By a wizard. An enchanter wizard. The kind with a cape."

The monk scowled. "How much exactly did you pay this school?"

The knight hesitated. "The payment was minimal. I mean— for a rich knight it was practically nothing."

"How much?"

"It's not like I still needed the farm if I was going to be a knight."

"Let me get this straight. You gave up your farm. They gave you a couple weeks training, this crap armor, a sword—"

"The sword was actually extra."

"And sent you off to kill dragons?"

"Well, yes. There aren't many dragons around here so they suggested I start by killing mages."

The monk leaned on their staff. "Alright, now that I have a problem with. You're going to take me to this school and I'm going to have words with them."

"But the headmaster is a Grand Knight. Why would he listen to a monk?"

"Monks don't have staffs, you idiot."
