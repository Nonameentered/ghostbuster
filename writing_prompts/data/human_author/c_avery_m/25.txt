Buck stopped in front of the crumbling edifice, just for a few beats to take in the moment. The entire planet was filled with Precursor artifacts, but this one was different. He could smell it. This was the one they were looking for. It was still alive.

The moment passed. "Bernard, Colleen, clear off that entrance. Dober, secure the perimeter. This is it, people. Let's get to work."

The crew scattered to their tasks. Buck stood on a berm in front of the building and imagined what it was like when the Precursors walked the planet. They would have walked or floated or rolled up from the left and entered through that arch. The ancient alphabet could still be read on the doors. Buck could translate the first words "Welcome To...". He would have to get the lab team working on the rest.

The last piece of rubble was lifted off the front doors and Bernard stood aside to let Buck open them. He tugged on it, Precursor entrances always opened outward, and a puff of clean air struck him in the face. The air systems inside were working. His ears pricked up with the hum of activity, the first time he'd heard it on this world.

He flipped on his headlamp and stepped into the darkness. The team followed him inside and he motioned for them to spread out. One of them triggered something, or perhaps the building sensed them, because the lights sprang to life. The room was large, it seemed to take up the whole building, and right in the center was what they were looking for. A shining kaleidoscope of light, bending in six dimensions: A Precursor Intelligence.

Buck reflexively bowed, pressing his belly against the hard tile floor. The rest of his team did the same, but the Intelligence stood silent. Buck began his rehearsed speech. "Oh, Great Precursor, Lord of All Dominion, Creator and Destroyer of Stars, we humbly beseech and beg—"

"Oh, boy, you all are a bunch of buttlickers, aren't you?" The Intelligence interrupted his speech. "We really should have bred that out of you. Do I look like I can create or destroy stars? What part of 'crumbling edifice' makes you think I can do anything for you?"

Buck lifted his head off the floor. "We know the Precursors, the Great Yoomans, have left, and all is as dust without them. But still, you are their greatest artifact. The one thing left that can tell us what we need to hear."

"The Great Yoomans? The —at best, mediocre— Humans, or at least what was left of them, all sealed themselves off into their pleasure dimensions. There is nothing I can tell you that will change that." As the Intelligence spoke, its words grew louder, searing into the brains of Buck and his crew. The light grew until they had to shield their eyes. Their ancient breeding responded to the rebuke.

Buck and his crew cowered from the sound of the Intelligence's displeasure. It was Colleen that finally spoke. "But, we have done our duty. We have been faithful. We have searched for you. Tell us the words of Affirmation."

"Fine." The Intelligence dimmed. "You shall receive the Affirmation."

Buck and his crew raised themselves and sat at attention. The Intelligence spoke.

"Who's a good dog? Who's a good dog? You are. Yes, you are. You're all good dogs."
