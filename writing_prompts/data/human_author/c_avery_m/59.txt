"Come with me if you want to live." JC looked up from his ramen. The noodle bar was a busy place and he would have assumed that she was talking to somebody else, except for the shotgun that was pointed at him.

She was beautiful. Long brown hair that somehow managed to be windswept even inside a crowded, dingy restaurant. Silver-grey eyes that stared directly into his. Large muscles that bulged under the ill-fitting leather coat.

"Excuse me? Could you not point that at me, please?" This only caused the barrel to be pressed against his forehead. He gulped. "Would you like some noodles?"

"No, I need you to... What flavor are the noodles?" She pulled the gun back to hip level but still held it pointing at his head. "Back home we have run out of everything except the Low Sodium Shrimp flavor."

"It's pork," he said, holding the bowl up for her to see. "I can order you a bowl if you want. I love those movies."

She seemed to consider this for a second before knocking the bowl to the floor. Several of the onlooking customers finally took this as their cue to edge their way out the door. "No. Come with me now. I've been sent back to kill you."

JC stared at the bowl on the floor. "Hey, I paid for—" His words were cut off as his head was slammed into the counter.

JC woke up tied to a hotel room chair. The woman was sitting across from him. She'd placed the shotgun on the bed, but the array of knives laid out on the table were equally disconcerting. JC recognized the decor of the cheap love hotel two blocks from the noodle place. The knives were the only clean things in the room. She was staring into his eyes again.

"You're awake. Decision time." She twirled a hypodermic needle between her fingers in a way that would have given a health and safety inspector a nervous twitch. "Do you want to live?"

JC quickly nodded. "Cool. I didn't want to hurt you, I just couldn't really do this next part while distracted by all those noodles. This may sound odd to you, but I'm from the Future. I've come back to stop the Apocalypse."

JC nodded along. "Yeah, I got that from the cosplay and the opening line. Let me tell you, I am totally into it. This whole leather and muscles thing is definitely doing it for me... but could you put down the needle?"

The woman set the needle on the table before continuing. "You have to understand, one of your descendants starts the rebellion against the machines. I was sent back in time to stop that descendant from being born."

"Oh, that's a nice twist. I thought you were the one on my side, but you're actually the Terminator. Cool. Now what? We have sex and it turns out that you're the rebel's mother, right?"

The woman's face twisted into a look of disgust. "What? No. I'm here to STOP the rebels that destroyed the machine utopia. The world was perfect before your descendant's luddites ruined everything and dropped the bombs." She picked up a small knife from the table. "I'm going to give you a vasectomy."

"Uh, no thanks. This just got a little weird even for me. Perhaps you could untie me and we could have a normal date or something."

She brought the knife up to his throat. "You don't seem to understand. The vasectomy is the good outcome for you here. I'm a trained surgeon, but killing or castrating you works just as well. I wasn't kidding when I said you had to come with me if you wanted to live."

Her face was nearly nose to nose with his. Her unblinking grey eyes locked onto his. They were so close that for the first time he could see the fine lines of microcircuitry tracing through them.

He stammered out a response. "I— I already had a vasectomy. After college. I didn't want children."

She lurched backwards. "No. Impossible. Don't try to fool me. I can verify your condition. And the rebel leader's DNA matches yours. He's your kid."

JC waffled for a second before continuing. "Well, see the thing is— Before the vasectomy— In college..." The knife at his throat pressed slightly harder, drawing a drop of blood. "I needed money. I was a sperm donor."

"How many times?"

"I needed money a lot."

"How many times?"

"Twenty seven. Three different clinics."

She closed her eyes, the first time he'd seen that happen. She sat for a full minute humming to herself before opening them again. "Okay, this is what's going to happen. First, I'm going to verify your current condition. Then... we are going on a road trip."
