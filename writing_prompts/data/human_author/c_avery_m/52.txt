"How would collecting ten Manticore eggs help save your daughter?" Julia the Brave, Ranger of the Veldt, looked down at the peasant. She looked down on all peasants, not out of condescension— they just all seemed to be the same height: short. They always had generic nondescript faces. She'd already forgotten this one's name.

"Blue Manticore eggs. Fresh. Fertilized. They have to be viable or my daughter won't be saved." While they spoke the peasant continued to hoe the non-existent weeds in his garden. The garden didn't really seem large enough to feed multiple people.

"Are they used for some healing ritual? It would probably be easier for me to just go get a proper healer from the next town. I mean, I'm going there anyways. I can just send them along. You can pay them whatever you were going to give me for the manticore eggs. You never actually mentioned what the reward was, by the way." Julia had once collected twenty red squirrel pelts for a peasant just to be given an old helmet which she couldn't even wear.

"Oh, no, she's not ill. Not physically. This is more of an economical infirmity." The peasant was now using a mallet on a broken fence. He didn't seem to be making much progress on fixing it.

"Ecumencal illness? I can fetch a priest, then. A blessing will clear it right up. Priests usually work for free, so you can just give me the reward as a finder's fee." Priests did not, in fact, tend to work for free, but Julia figured that any of them willing to come out to this little dirthole probably would be the charitable type.

"No, no. Economical. The main problem is a distinct lack of jobs in the vicinity of the village. It's afflicting quite a few of the villagers, actually." The peasant had apparently decided that the broken fence was fixed enough and had gone back to hoeing. The fence had fallen back into its previous state as soon as he'd turned his back.

Julia rubbed the bridge of her nose. "Let me get this straight. You want me to risk my life collecting eggs from the nest of a Mother Manticore—"

"Blue Manticore"

"From the nest of a Mother Blue Manticore, so that your daughter can— what— sell them? And I'm guessing that in return you will give me some piece of shit family heirloom that I'll sell to the first merchant I come across."

Julia turned to leave. She didn't know why she bothered stopping in this little village. It was peaceful, but not exactly prosperous. All the stores were rundown and the people walked around in a haze of unhappiness. Unhappy for no reason, as far as she could tell, since there were no demons attacking them or goblins stealing their crops.

"Wait, Sir Ranger! You don't understand. We don't intend to sell the eggs. We intend to raise them." Julia stopped in her tracks and turned back.

"Raise them? Ten Manticore. Ten Blue Manticore running around in a village this size? You're an idiot. They aren't livestock. The stingers and teeth may be magical and worth a lot but you won't be able to collect them. And believe me when I say the meat does not taste good. They'd terrorize the village. Try to raise those things and you'd need two dozen adventurers to clear them out."

The peasant had finally put down his hoe. He seemed taller. "We actually estimated four dozen adventurers, more if we could get them established in the southern caves. Those caves were always a bit of a death trap. We could put a few in the ruins to the north, but the village council is still trying to negotiate with a band of goblins to settle that land."

"It's peaceful here, why would you want monsters?" Julia stared at the peasant. He had blue eyes and a crooked nose.

"Yes, and when the last of them were killed, we rejoiced. But then the adventurers stopped coming. We were a prosperous wealthy village, cozy inside our walls with our small gardens. The adventurers escorted food convoys in, spent gold gearing up and went off after monsters. Then they sold their loot and escorted the convoys back to the city. We made money on both ends and never had to leave the walls. I used to spend all day reading and relaxing. Now we're expected to plow fields." As he spoke several other villagers gathered to listen. Julia finally noticed that the peasants' rags were actually dirty silk.

"Why are you telling me this? I'm an adventurer, too." The villagers surrounded her. She would have felt threatened if she didn't know that she could easily take on all them at once.

"We've heard of you, Julia the Brave, Ranger of the Veldt. You've been wandering a long time. Perhaps you'd like to finally settle down. The mayor's house is empty. And we'd need somebody to manage the monsters. It would be a — paid position."

The peasant squared his shoulders and looked her level in the eyes. Gaurant. The peasant had said his name was Gaurant. Julia looked around at the villagers. She'd never noticed before how they all looked different from each other. Not generic at all.

"Well, my feet are tired, and I always did like animals..."
