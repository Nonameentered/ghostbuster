Julia looked at the youth kneeling before her. He shivered slightly with one knee in the deep snow, his tattered black robe barely keeping the wind off his skin.

"Former Dark Lord," she said with an exasperated sigh.

"Pardon me, your Voidship?" The youth looked up at her with a slack jaw, his eyes flitting about and refusing to make contact with her own.

"I'm not the Dark Lord. I'm the Former Dark Lord. Not even that, since the Dark Lord's soul has been exorcised and shredded in the Void of Souls. I'm just Julia."

The first few months had been a constant stream of sycophants. She had blasted a few of the most eager into dust but that had just ended up encouraging the rest. When she'd moved out to the middle of the woods most of them had got the point and those that had not been captured or turned over a new leaf had glommed together into their own little dark armies, each fronted by a surviving lieutenant or in a few cases a particularly ambitious mook.

"I understand the story that the unfaithful have spread. But I recognize that raven hair, that aquiline nose, those dark piercing eyes, and those thin bloodless lips. The face of the Dark Lord, your face, appears every night in my dreams."

Julia took a step back and felt her nose with both hands. She was reasonably sure that this boy didn't know what aquiline meant.

"Stand up and go away. I came out here to be away from all of you. All of you— leftovers."

The youth stood and gave a wink. "Ah, I understand, my Lord— I mean Former Lord. The forces of light truly did defeat you."

"They really did."

He looked over his shoulder, gave a knowing nod, and continued speaking in an elevated voice. "Yes. Those fu— friendly elves and their chosen one were too strong for you. Even this blood sacrifice you have hanging here is of no use."

"Blood sacrifice?" Julia turned to look where he pointed. "That's a deer. It's dinner for the next three weeks. All I do is hunt out in the woods now. You can drop the act. There is nobody listening."

The youth dropped back down to a knee. "Ah, you have shielded our conversation, my Lord. I should have known."

"No, I haven't— That's... ugh." Julia shook her head. She hadn't had to blast anyone in months, but this stupid kid was getting on her nerves.

"What task do you have for me, my Lord."

"You're what? Eighteen? Nineteen? Just... go to school."

"That doesn't seem very dark. Is this part of a cunning plan?"

"Um... yes. Law school. Go to law school."

The youth shot upright. "Very evil indeed, my Lord. I shall go at once."

As the boy ran off, Julia shouted after him. "Don't contact me, I'll contact you."
