The crowd was a mix of gnomes and humans, but the Capitol Police mainly saw the humans. Some of the officers lacked the magical senses to see the gnomes, but mostly it was that the shortest human in the crowd, a five year old boy, was six inches taller than the largest gnome.

The humans carried signs, protesting the day's proposed vote on the anti-gnome legislation. Golbur, like most of the gnomes, didn't bother with a sign. Instead he carried a wand, tucked into his brightly colored coat and hidden behind his long beard.

The wand wasn't illegal back home, if you had the right license, though the human sheriff of his county had refused to give licenses to any gnomes since his election by the human majority on an anti-gnome campaign platform. Here in D.C. it was strictly verboten.

Golbur knew how the day would go. Either the bill would be tabled and filibustered by the pro-gnome majority, or it would come to a vote and pass. And generations of peaceful coexistence would end in oppression.

In his earbud, he heard the moment when they called the vote on C-Span, and the two gnomish Senators walked out in protest. With the first "Yea", in his mind, the first shots had already been fired. A ripple of discontent passed through the crowd, but still, they waited for the fiftieth yea before acting. No one could later say they hadn't waited.

The gnomes had spent the morning scouting out the barricades and had found one, staffed by magic-blind three officers. That's where the first gnomes slipped through, unnoticed. When they were finally seen by the police commander on the stairs, officers were pulled off the other barricades to deal with them. This was Golbur's cue, along with fifty others, to loose his wand and blast the barricade in front of him. The concrete crumbled into dust and gravel. The barricade to his left disappeared in a puff of smoke, the one to his right suddenly sprouted flowers.

The humans among the protesters were confused, most of them hadn't been in on the plan. Their shouts continued to distract the guards as the gnomish berzerkers rushed forward. The sharp points of their red hats gleamed in the sunlight, betraying the metal spikes hidden there. The betrayal came too late for most of the officers, as the hats lanced upwards below their bulletproof vests, impaling them.

Golbur rushed after them, wand ready. Other gnomes plucked weapons from the fallen officers and followed. Islands of resistance appeared where the gnomes had been less successful, but Golbur ignored them along with most of the crowd. His target was the doors.

The first officer on the stairs was magic blind. He began to fire his gun randomly into the crowd. A gnome next to Golbur fell, his blue tunic turning red with blood. Golbur struck at the officer with his wand, leaving behind a dried husk of cracked skin. The rest of the police on the stairs began to flee.

The great doors were sealed against them. A hush came over the crowd of gnomes as Golbur stepped up to the portal and knocked twice. As the doors creaked open, the two gnomish senators inside welcomed their brethren.

As gnomes filled the hallways, the war had just begun.
