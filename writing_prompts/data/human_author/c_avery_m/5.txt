"Please sit down. There's something we want to talk to you about. Well, we've actually wanted to speak to you about this for a long time. And the most important thing to remember is that it does not change how much we love you."

Mother and Father sat across from me on the couch. Father had replaced his normally stern look with a forced smile. Mother looked the same as always. I wiggled in my seat. I'd been in the middle of playing and this had the look of a long conversation.

They waited quietly for me to stop moving. I forced my limbs to be still.

"Now, Timmy, there's really only one way to say this. You see, you are adopted." Mother reached out a hand to grasp one of my tentacles.

"What do you mean I'm adopted?" My tentacles all started wiggling again. "I don't remember being adopted. I remember all things. All time is laid before my mindscape. I have spent eternity as your child and know no other family. What you say is impossible," I gurgled.

Father stood. "Now, son. Don't go spraying acid. Yes, we are your eternal parents. But we weren't always. We wanted a child and... well...  we went to the Goat of the Woods and... one thing led to another..."

Father's eyes began to glaze over as he stared into the distance over my hump. He got like this sometimes. Mother gripped his hand and he shuddered. "What was I? Oh, yes. The Goat. We got you from the Goat. Bonded for eternity."

Father slumped back into the couch blinking. When he got like this I usually just went to play. I turned to Mother. "Freddy Wilkonson once told me that you weren't Mother. I did not like this. I showed him his death. Freddy Wilkonson no longer speaks to me in that way. Are you Mother?"

"Yes, Timmy, I'm still your Mother. Nothing can change that now. The Goat sealed us for eternity." Mother's eyes turned to the right and she began to stare at the same point in space as Father. They would be this way for a while.

I turned my eyestalks to look at myself. Adopted? Is this why I have tentacles?
