The lawn gnome stood in gloom. Normally Uncle Tarquin's front lawn was brightly lit, the manicured grass carefully maintained by the crew he paid to do it. Despite being bedridden he took great pride in his lawn. But the power outage had left the whole town dark. Julia had detoured around a downed power line on the way over, so it seemed like it would be long hours or days until it was restored here.

Julia found the key under the fake rock near the door. Even in the dark the fake rock stood out, but nobody in this town seemed to be worried about theft. Uncle Tarquin probably would have kept the door unlocked, he was fearless, but the daily nurse insisted on locking it after her visits.

"Uncle Tarquin? It's me. I came to check on you."  It was dark inside. Julia should have brought her phone for a flashlight, but it was still sitting on the side table at home. Instead she brought out the little light she kept on her keychain.

The flashlight was dim, but she'd spent a lot of time here as a child. She knew the house well; every corner and hiding place. As she walked to the stairs, she heard a creak. It sounded like the sound of the top step of the old staircase. "Uncle? Are you up?"

The house was chillier than it had a right to be. She supposed he didn't bother heating up these other rooms now. Looking up the stairs, she thought saw a shadow move, running back into the darkness. "Uncle, you aren't supposed to be up."

At the top of the stairs, she could hear the sound of deep breathing. The door to her right swung on its hinges. The spare bedroom. She'd spent many nights there while her parents were going through their divorce. She entered and scanned her flashlight over the walls. When she turned to look in the closet, something grabbed her foot and she stumbled, falling onto the bed.

The flashlight fell out of her hand, skittering across the floor into the corner. She could feel claws crawling up her leg. She froze in the dark. The monster was back. She'd always said it was real.

She'd never fought it as a child, but now she swung her arms and kicked. She felt the iron bands of the monster's hands as she struggled. Then she gathered her courage and opened her eyes. The monster wasn't here. She could see the dim light from her keychain across the room. She got up, smoothed the bedsheets, and walked out of the room.

The sound of breathing was louder now, coming from her Uncle's room. From out of the open door she could see the red glow of two eyes. The monster's lair.

She took a deep breath and stepped into the room. Beside her flashlight, the only glow came from the indicators on the battery backup for the medical equipment. The oxygen concentrator beeped as it sucked in another deep breath to force into Uncle Tarquin's nose. "Uncle, are you awake?"

"You should be awake for this." She shook him and rubbed on his solar plexus, but all she got was a moan. "Whatever."

She grabbed the glass of water sitting on his bedside table and poured it over the battery backup, making sure most of the water went down the vents in the casing. The equipment all went dark. After wiping the glass clean, she placed it on the floor.

She waited in the renewed silence to be sure. After twenty minutes, she got impatient with the rattling breath still coming from Uncle Tarquin's chest. A hand over his nose and mouth only took two minutes.

"Goodbye monster."

After she relocked the front door and replaced the key to the dark house, she kicked the lawn gnome face down in the dirt.
