Ceraph descended through the ceiling, diving through its atoms like a fiery plasma. Their face was perfect, with a sharp nose, eyes as black as the void, skin the same color as whomever gazed upon them, and pearl white teeth. Their argent robes swirled around them as they descended with a gentle flap of their wings. The halo that floated over their head nearly blinded all who looked upon them.

"Be not afraid," they commanded as they settled to the floor. "I am here to deliver the message of the Lord!"

"Name?" answered the mousy girl behind the table in front of them. The sign taped to the front of the tape read 'Spokane City Science Symposium'. The table was covered in numerous calligraphed placards, set in glossy transparency with metallic clasps.

"I am Ceraph, Angel of the Lord, First Choir, Messenger of Redemption. Be not afraid of my Radiance, for my message is one of Peace."

The mousy girl consulted the parchment in front of her. "Is that with an S? I'm not finding it."

Ceraph's halo pulsed with displeasure. "It's with a C. But my coming, while foretold, was not announced. Your parchment will have no mention of me. But my message —"

"Oh, we'll have to do a same day registration, then. That's alright, you just won't get one of the good name badges. The fee is seventy five dollars. Cash or Credit?" The mousy girl took from her bag a glowing tablet.

"My message must not be delayed, so I shall render unto Caesar." Ceraph stretched forth their holy hand and waved it over the table, leaving a pile of gold coins. "I shall require a room to extol my message."

The mousy girl picked up one of the coins. Each of them bore the date 1933 and was stamped with 'United States of America Twenty Dollars'. She started to count them. "All the symposium rooms are booked up, of course. But lucky for you, we do have a space open in the poster room if you have something to present. It's a hundred dollars for the poster spot, but this should cover it. Let me get your change. Oh, and don't forget your nametag."

"Hello, my name is Serif," read the sticker that adhered to the argent raiment of the angel. They stood in a corner of the great hall, filled with people. The din of the conversations around them nearly deafened them, as a great crowd surged amongst the tables, each adorned with a large graphic placard.

"Listen to my message, children of the Lord!"

A small man stopped in front of him. "Hello."

Ceraph's halo pulsed as they smiled. "You have come for my message, child of the redeemer. The Lord says—"

"I like your cosplay. I mean, this isn't really that sort of convention, but it's cool."

"I come not in disguise, but in the glory of the Lord! I have a warning. The Earth shall warm and the ice shall melt. The Lord will break his covenant and floods shall once again cover the land. The fertile ground shall be turned to dust."

"Yeah, half the posters here have something to do with Climate Change. Does your research offer any specific approaches?"

Ceraph drew themself up to their full height, towering over the mortals in the room. Finally, someone had asked for their message. The Lord had foreseen this. This was the moment to deliver their message.

Their voice was as that of an entire choir, drowning out the rest of the room, as they gave the message of the Lord. "I come to tell you of the Path to your Salvation. Clean Coal technology with Direct Carbon Capture!"
