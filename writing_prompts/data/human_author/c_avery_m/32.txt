>What'd you have for breakfast today, and how was it?

So I don't usually eat breakfast. The last thing I ate was a giant bowl of ice cream last night...

>What's the longest story you've written? I ask because I'm trying to break out of short stories and you mentioned you're interested in novels.

I wrote a 7k word short story about six months ago. It was the first longer form piece I'd done and my plan was to sit on it for about six months and then go back and edit it to see if my skills had improved. I should probably go back and do that soon. 

I wrote a couple of other short stories of around 5k words, but for those I already figured out some good lessons: 1) Don't try to make two characters the POV at the same time. 2) It's hard to make an Artificial Intelligence the POV character.

>Do you have a favorite book or one that you are particularly fond of? Like one that you can go back and reread anytime either because you love it or you read it at the right time. Something like that.

I don't reread books very often. However, I did recently reread \[American Gods\]. I had loved it the first time I read it when it first came out and was worried that it wouldn't hold up decades later, as I had recently read \[Last Call\] by Tim Powers which was a very similar genre, and I had hated it. Fortunately I found American Gods just as good as I remembered.
