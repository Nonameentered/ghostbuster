Julia watched as Tarquin was led off by a bevy of local village lasses. The bulging muscles and magical shining armor usually had that effect. They no longer cared that two months ago he'd just been a blacksmith's apprentice. Now he was the Chosen One on his quest to defeat the Off-White Lord. Julia was ignored by the villagers.

"At the very least they could have thrown me a serving wench. By Our Lady's Nails, I'd settle for a stableboy." Julia turned to deal with the horses. Tarquin's noble steed, Shadowemail, was chomping nobly at the village green, the packhorse was next to him showing indignation at not yet being unburdened. Her own mule had wandered off somewhere.

When she made a move to unload the packhorse, Shadowemail intercepted her and insisted on being unsaddled first. "Let me through. You are just as bad as Tarquin. I know you can use your magic to unsaddle yourself if you want. I've half a mind to let you find your own stable for the night."

"Excuse me."

Julia started at the voice. "I'll admit, Shadowemail, I didn't know you could talk. Tell Packy to hold his horse and I'll do you first."

"No, miss, that was me." A man stepped out from behind the horses. His torso was small, but long stick-thing limbs made him tall and lanky. He wore a dark grey suit and had somehow kept his shoes clean in the middle of the horse pasture. He continued with a smile, "I would like to speak to you for a moment."

Julia froze when she saw his teeth. "You're not human. You're a—"

"A bureaucrat. Yes. I represent the Sidekick and Comic Relief Union, and I would like to speak with you about your relationship to— let's see— a certain Tarquin, Chosen One of The Chartreuse Lady of Lower Northeast Westington." As he spoke he quickly unsaddled the steed and unpacked the horse, hanging everything over the green's fence. "I believe your horses can now spare you for a moment. You'll find your mule later enjoying the clover behind the Inn."

"Uh— alright." She scurried after the bureaucrat as he took a single step over the fence and strode towards the Inn.

\----------------------------------------

The bureaucrat had already secured a table with two mugs of something hot and alcoholic when Julia got to the Inn. He unrolled a parchment and immediately began to question Julia.

"Just for our records, you are Julia Nolastnaam, Companion of Tarquin Razorsmith, Chosen One of The Chartreuse et cetera, on a holy mission to defeat the Off-White Lord. Correct?" He poised a pen over the parchment.

"Yes. Well, I wouldn't say companion. Not like a bed-companion. We're just friends. Like Best Friends." She took a sip of the drink. It tasted like warm, perfect after a day of traveling through what could only be described as not-warm.

"Very good. Next question: Do you have reason to believe that you will die in such a fashion as to provide Tarquin with character development and motivation?"

Julia spit out her drink. "What? Die? No, Tarquin would never let anything happen to me. He promised he'd look after me. He's been like— you know— my protector since we were kids."

"Oh, dear." The bureaucrat dipped his pen into his inkwell and began to quickly scribble on the parchment. "That's very concerning. Have you had any indication that Tarquin derives his abilities from the Power of Friendship?"

"Uh— no. He got his powers from this Crystal thing. They get stronger whenever he's angry or hurt."

"That's concerning. One final question. Does Tarquin ever speak to ghosts or spirits?"

"Well, yeah," Julia laughed. "All the time. That's just one of the things the crystal does."

The bureaucrat set down his pen and signaled to the corners of the room. "I've heard enough. It's quite clear to me that you'll be killed in the confrontation with the Off-White Lord, providing your Chosen One with the motivation to complete his quest. You'll likely return as a ghost in the sequels. I'm afraid I have no choice but to place you under a protective order."

Two more bureaucrats unfolded from nearby tables and grabbed her arms. "Your Tarquin will just have to take motivation from your disappearance. Don't worry, we'll leave proper evidence."
