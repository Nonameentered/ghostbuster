>What's your favourite thing about writing? It could be an aspect of writing itself, part of the process, or just a particular feeling you get from it.

The growth and improvement. If I look back at some of the stuff I did six months ago (for example [this piece](https://www.reddit.com/r/c_avery_m/comments/q8gbld/wp_youre_a_high_level_black_mage_with_a_few/)) I can already tell that I've improved my skills.

>Do you have a favourite piece, or one that you think best encapsulate you as a writer?

Other than those listed above, I'm going to choose [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/c_avery_m/comments/q8sg2q/wp_so_what_youre_telling_me_the_demon_king_sighed/). Just the right amount of humor.

>What's your favourite writing snack (if you have one)?

I don't usually eat while I'm writing, but if you were to place a pile of Reese's Peanut Butter cups in front of me I wouldn't NOT eat them...
