Blind dates are ideal. The sightless don't go insane upon meeting us. We admit there was some confusion among us about the term on our first date. Tammy should have been more clear, or perhaps the onus was on us to clarify. But, it was only a brief encounter. A few months in a pleasure dimension will probably straighten him out.

Tonight's date is better. Tammy promised. They walk in using a stick and ask to be directed to our table. We do not allow the waitstaff's minds to acknowledge our existence, but they bring our date to the correct table anyways. We rise noisily to greet them.

"Hello, you are the one of which Tammy told us. The being known as Julia?" We flex reality in a formal bow. Julia does not react to the sight. This is good. We are pretty sure they are female.

"Yes. And you must be Golbux." She mispronounced our name, but that is forgivable for a being with only one tongue. "It's nice to meet you, Tammy told me so much about you."

"Hopefully the information imparted left a positive impression. Tammy also provided much information about you. It was all very acceptable. Please sit. Appetizers have already been requested. If they are not acceptable, additional requests can be made." We squelch back into our chair.

"Oh, I'll eat anything on a first date, if you're lucky." Julia makes a facial contortion with one of her blind eyes. We do not understand, but desire to be 'cool', so decide to agree.

"Yes, we also consume all things. Our worshippers say that it is our best trait." We worry that that was a weird thing to say. This is perhaps not going well. But Julia laughs and smiles.

"Oh, you're funny. I like that. I can't place your accent, though. Is it German?" She slides a hand across the table towards us. We form a flesh hand to match.

"No." We consumed the mind of a German once. He deserved it. He wanted us to help them in a war. Even we thought he was a bad person. "It is... Austrian."

"You sound like you belong in some giant castle. Tammy said you were old money." Julia's hand grips ours and a connection forms. We sense the depths of her existence.

Her past is tragic.

Her present is the calm of the ocean before a storm.

Her future is endless. She will accept us.

"Money is not important. But we are rich in time."
