Absolute darkness surrounded Ariadne. A few minutes of it and her mind began to imagine movements in the black. She dismissed them and tried to focus on the distant sound of water dripping. After a moment she turned her headlamp back on.

The stalactites popped back into her vision. "To the left," she told herself, the voice echoing around the cavern. She affixed an anchor for the guideline indicating her direction and continued spelunking deeper.

The cavern ran down for miles. Several more times Ariadne stopped to listen for sounds before choosing her path and turning. The sound of water grew stronger. Finally, she came to what seemed like a dead end. She turned off her headlamp once more to listen and adjusted to the dark.

Ariadne realized that she could see her hands. There was a dim light spilling into the chamber from behind one of the stalactites. The sound of water came from the same place.

\-------------------------------------

The opening grew into a large, lit cavern. A small stream divided it in two with a pool in the middle. A rickety wooden raft sat upon the pool, holding a skeletal figure. The figure was snoring.

Ariadne tied off her guideline and climbed down towards the figure. "Hello? What is this place?"

The figure jumped awake. Ariadne couldn't see into the figure's hood. Neither the cavern's light nor her headlamp penetrated it. "Τι; ΠΟΥ; — Er — Sorry, that was English wasn't it. Hello. Just a second."

The figure turned to the other side of the cavern and shouted. "Everybody get up! We have a new soul!" The hood turned back to Ariadne and she felt a piercing gaze. It yelled again. "Ah, shit. Nevermind. It's alive. — I mean... Hello. I am Charon. Welcome to Hades, land of the dead, et cetera, et cetera. We don't get many visitors these days."

Ariadne looked at the small stream feeding the pool in which the raft floated. "And this is the river Styx?"

Charon looked embarrassed. "It used to be bigger. If you give me your obal, I shall ferry you across."

"That's the coin to pay the ferry toll? Yeah— I didn't bring any money." She paused for a moment. "It looks like I could just step across that narrow bit up there."

Charon slumped against his poll. "No, don't please. It's the principle of the thing. There's a pile of coins next to that rock there."

She handed him one of the coins from the pile and boarded the ferry. The pool was barely larger than the raft, but Charon took great ceremony by pushing off and gliding the small distance across. "Welcome to Hades!"

"You already said that." Ariadne could now see a crumbling stone arch. Engraved on the top was "άσε κάθε ελπίδα εσύ που μπαίνεις" beneath that was carved "lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate". Beneath that was painted "laisse tout espoir, toi qui entres". At the bottom was a sign that read "Welcome. Visitors are no longer required to abandon anything." The sign was faded.

Chained to the entrance was the beast Cerberus. He was still sleeping. He had exactly one head and appeared to be a puggle.

Ariadne reached down to pet him. "Hey boy." The dog awoke and stared at Ariadne.

Charon spoke from behind her. "Careful mortal. Don't let our appearance deceive you. Cerberus is still a fierce guardian."

Ariadne took out her rock hammer and struck the chain that held the beast, shattering it. "His name is Mr. Bacon and I'm taking him back with me."

She took up the dog in her arms and walked back to the Styx. "You'll never cross. You have no coin to pay me, mortal. You are trapped here until—" Ariadne stepped across the narrow point in the stream. "Well, you'll never find your way out of here. Only Orpheus has ever made that journey and you have not his ears."

Ariadne grabbed hold of her guideline and gave Charon one last look. "For that, I came prepared."
