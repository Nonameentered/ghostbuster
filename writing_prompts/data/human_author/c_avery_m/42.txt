Maybe it wasn't working. I hated the neighbors and they should have moved out by now. I considered trying again. I'd only ever had to try once before and I wasn't sure what would happen if I double teamed a wish.

I'd wished the neighbors gone and launched my paper airplane out the window. The last time I'd gotten rid of a neighbor I'd done the same thing. The airplane had struck their mailbox flag, knocking it down, causing the mail carrier to bypass their box and not pick up their utility payment. The power was off for twelve hours before they sorted it out. But twelve hours without a television to distract them was enough for them to realize they hated each other. The wife had ended up dating the police officer and the house had gone back on the market.

This time the airplane had struck the old oak tree. I'd watched it that far. A single acorn had been knocked off and landed in their yard. The acorn had germinated in just a couple days, which is fast for an acorn, but I don't think I have the patience for the tree to grow and fall on the house after a windstorm or something.

I could see the sapling from my porch. I'd spent all morning watching it and it hadn't done anything.

Oh, there's something. The neighbor is coming out to mow the lawn. He'll run over the tree with the mower and it will snag the blades. The mower will break, the grass will get long, code enforcement will have to come out and fine them. The fines will pile up until they move in the middle of the night, in shame.

No, he's mowing around it. And the wife, she's coming out and putting mulch around the sapling. Obviously they've noticed the tree, so it's having some effect. Is one of them going to realize that an oak tree is a hundred year commitment? They'll be dead and gone before it's as big as the one in my yard. The sense of impending mortality will surely drive them to move.

They see me and wave. I wave back and duck back inside. When I check back later the tree has a little stake attached to it, to make it grow straight. They've grown attached to it. Perhaps it would die and the feeling of loss would engender a deep dislike for the neighborhood. They would move to somewhere new to start over.

At sunset, I'd had enough. I got out my folding paper and made another plane.

"I wish you didn't live next to me." The new plane flew off and hit the oak tree. Another acorn fell in their yard. I folded another. "I wish we weren't neighbors." Another acorn. More planes. "I wish— I wish— I wish." Acorn. Acorn. Acorn. A gust of wind rattled through the oak's branches and sent down a shower of the nuts.

I ran over to their yard. The stupid little tree was still there. "Stupid fricking tree, why won't you work." It snapped very easily under my heel. The yard was filled with acorns. I grabbed a handful and threw them at the house. "I wish we didn't live next to each other." They bounced off and scattered back into the yard.

The chirp of a siren startled me out of my hate. The flashing blue and red lights made me blink. I dropped another handful of acorns.

When they arrested me I realized I should have worded my wishes more carefully.
