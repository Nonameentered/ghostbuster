Julia awoke to the sound of singing birds. A stream of light broke through her window and struck her face in a rainbow. She squinted and buried her head under a pillow. Reaching out to turn off the alarm, her hand landed on a bird, which took off with a squawk. She bolted upright.

A flock of birds began to encircle her like a halo, flashing through the rainbow from the window. The west-facing window. She brushed the birds away and yelled across the house. "Tarquina!"

"Tarqu—" Julia's yell was cut off as her bedroom door opened. A tall Amazonian ducked into the room sporting a tray piled with a steaming breakfast and far too many exposed abs. As she straightened up her head barely missed the ceiling. She wore a leather harness festooned with draping white silk.

The giantess placed the breakfast tray in front of Julia. It was piled with a meal appropriate for a fifties sitcom: steak and eggs, ham, hash browns, bacon and sausage, pancakes and a waffle, and both milk and orange juice. Julia normally had an entire half cold strawberry pop-tart or occasionally half an entirely cold strawberry pop-tart. She rubbed her eyes and ignored the tray, as it didn't contain any coffee.

"Tarquina, why is there sun coming in my window? It's six thirty. The sun should be over there somewhere," she said pointing vaguely over her shoulder. "Did you— Did you move the sun?"

Tarquina tossed her golden hair in a laugh. "No silly, that would be impossible. I created a second one. Just a little guy. Your room is always so dreary in the morning. I suppose I could have used mirrors, but it's just not the same. So, a nice little sun, just for you and the surrounding hundred square miles or so, and a proper breakfast."

"I have a feeling that's going to fuck with somebody's crops. Where's the coffee?" Julia swung her feet out of bed. She was wearing sweatpants and a baggy hoodie and she didn't plan on changing that all day.

"Coffee? But you always drank orange juice. I mean— It's better for you and doesn't give you that coffee breath. I just thought that today we could do some stuff. We haven't hung out enough since I got back from the place."

Julia plodded off to the kitchen in search of coffee. Tarquina followed her with the tray. A clay automaton stood in the kitchen, busying itself by cleaning up the residue of four breakfast meats and various other splatters. After she had started the coffee pot, Julia took a sausage from the tray.

"Okay, Tarquina, I'm gonna be straight here. I've known about your little crush thing for months, but I thought you would get over it. It was fun when you were a mousy little roommate. But this—" she said, gesturing broadly at everything, "is not really my thing."

"Is it the hair? I can go back to brown. I can even drop the height, see." Tarquina shrunk down to a height that would have been normal for an NFL quarterback, still a foot and a half taller than she had been last week.

"No, Tarquina. It's that we are roommates and friends, not lovers. Also— let's see— the fact that you are some sort of goddess now and you have never bothered to explain how that is? You just keep vaguely alluding to some 'place'. What happened to you?"

Tarquina shrank further, back to the mousy little roommate. "I just thought of it as the other place. It was bad. Lonely. I just learned to control it. It took so long."

"You were only gone for like a minute."

"A minute here. There it was a thousand years. Ten thousand. But it was okay once you were there." She reached out to hold Julia's hand.

Julia stared at the familiar hand. "That wasn't me. I was here the whole time."

A tear streamed down Tarquina's face. "Bringing you there was the first thing I learned to do. I don't know why you don't remember."
