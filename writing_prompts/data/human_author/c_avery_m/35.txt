"Can you smell that, Tarquin?" Julia gestures around the town square as she closes her car door. "It smells like adventure. My nose pricks up at the scent."

Tarquin rolls himself out of the driver's side and ambles around to join her. "Your nose looks the same to me. But then, Ma'am, I'm no expert on pricks like you are."

A fierce stare from Julia silences him. He turns to take their bags from the trunk while Julia straps on her sword. After getting it settled into the most attractive angle, she looks into the side view mirror to adjust her large brimmed hat and holds out a hand to Tarquin. He opens a long hard-sided case from the back of the car and hands her a peacock feather, which she carefully sticks into her hat. "Alright, let's check out that store. The locals are staring."

She strides off towards the storefront, labeled in faded paint as "Beakman's General, Sundries, and Post Office". A small group of men were loitering outside drinking. Tarquin shoulders an axe and follows at her heels, waddling slightly as he adjusts his chainmail.

Julia uses the railing in front of the store to strike pose number three: left hand on hip, right hand posed to hold her chin thoughtfully or point as needed, head tilted up and to the side so that the peacock feather streams across her shoulder. "Greetings, townsfolk. I am Julia Hernandez D'Oro the Heartrender. I sense great adventure in this town. Pray, tell me what ails you. Be it dark evil or mighty beast, I shall vanquish it."

One of the men in front of the store sets down his mug and picks up a quarterstaff from a row leaning against the wall. "We don't need your kind here. Bloodsucking treasure hunters. Why don't you just move along?"

"I can assure you my desired remunerations are quite reasonable." She leans casually back into pose number six: hand brushing against the hilt of her sword, head turned to survey the scene out of the corner of her eyes. "Pray, tell me what beast caused these gashes in this stone here."

The rest of the men put down their mugs and pick up staves. "Those are Beakman's old pickup. The muffler drags."

"It doesn't smell like a truck. The scent is quite distinctive." Julia starts to trace the gashes with her foot, while giving Tarquin a sign with her hand that he should try to look menacing, a job he typically fails at.

"I said, why don't you justâ€”"

"WHAT IS GOING ON HERE." The voice booms from the town square. Julia and Tarquin spin to face it. The glowing eyes draw their attention. Tarquin stands transfixed while Julia shrugs off the enchantment to take in the rest of the creature: a swirling mass of claws and iridescent green scales.

Julia draws her sword and swats at Tarquin to ready his axe. "Your enchantments won't fool me, Draco!"

"That's an offensive stereotype." The voice comes from the townsman behind her. "You can't just assume that all dragons are named 'Draco'. We call him Darryl."

"HE'S RIGHT. WE AREN'T ALL NAMED DRACO." The dragon coughs and continues in a quieter tone. "Sorry. I mean, technically my name does happen to be Draco, but you couldn't have known that. Most humans can't pronounce it so they just call me Darryl."

The swirling scales settle down and the eyes cease their glowing. Tarquin lowers his axe. "They can't pronounce 'Draco'?"

"No, Draco is my cousin. I'm Draco. It's a subtle difference in the 'r'. That's why we usually go with Darryl."

Julia stares at Tarquin. "If you are done discussing Dragolinguistics, Tarquin, please ready your axe. This foul beast shall torment these townsfolk no longer." She turns back to the dragon. "We shall slay you... Darryl. And the townsfolk shall happily remunerate us with a very reasonable fee on top of whatever we find in your treasure hoard."

Julia gestures at the assembled men behind her only to realize they have moved. They now form a line between her and the dragon.

"We shall not let you harm Darryl. He's married to the mayor's daughter and an upstanding member of the community. We don't take kindly to your type here, so you need to get."

Julia takes a look at the stout quarterstaves and leans towards Tarquin, whispering out of the corner of her mouth. "Go start the car." She hears the engine turn over as she is speaking turns to realize that Tarquin has anticipated her wise decision.

She walks backwards to the car. "You'd best never come to my town, Draco."

A stream of fire burns her peacock feather to a crisp.
