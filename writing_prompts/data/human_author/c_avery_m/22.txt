"I want to go to Taco Bell. Many sapients say it is the best food in the galaxy."

Golbur looked at his companion, who was holding a guidebook in her claws. "Did you just read that in the book?"

Julix looked up from the book. "Yes, but they must be good. Otherwise why would there be so many of them?"

Golbur adjusted his eyestalks to get a good look at the book. "I believe that their frequency is just a holdover from the human's Fast Food Wars. Plus it seems like they mostly serve carnivores."

"No, no. It says that scientists have been able to detect only trace amounts of real meat in their food products."

Golbur allowed himself to be dragged through the door. This restaurant location did seem to cater to non-humans, at least. He saw several Vulcans, Xenomorphs, and a Tralfamadorian sitting in the humanoid section. The hostess led them to a section with cushioned lounge seats that would fit their carapaces.

The hostess was overly cheery. "You'll please excuse me if I don't recognize your species. Would you like the Green menu, the Blue, or the Red? We also have a White menu for omnivores."

Golbur responded with a smile that made the hostess flinch only slightly. "The Green, thank you."

The hostess handed over menus from her stack. "Our Green special today is the Doritos Vegi-sushi Chalupa Supreme. I highly recommend it."

Julix was ignoring her menu and looking at the table next to them. She pointed at a spiky object on the table. "I want that!"

The hostess turned to look where she was pointing. "I'm afraid that item is on the Black menu. Approved species only."

"It's a plant, right? If it's a plant we can eat it. We can digest anything on Earth. The doctors said so." Julix turned one eyestalk back to Golbur, pleading.

"Okay, one Durado Vegisucky Chilpa Soup Ream and one of whatever that spiky thing is." When the hostess hesitated, he continued. "We'll sign a waiver."

\-----------------------------------------

It took Julix five minutes to claw open her spiky fruit. Golbur waited patiently to start his own food until she was ready. "Why did you order that?"

"It's spiky. That means the inside is delicious. Otherwise it wouldn't have to protect itself." She finally got the top off, exposing bright yellow flesh. "Oh, it smells wonderful."

"Perhaps we should scan it?" Golbur spoke too late. Julix was already biting off chunks of the fruit.

"Oh, I was right. It is good. So goob. Wat? Miy wips theel weird. Why iz eberyting tingling?"

Golbur pulled out his scanner and got a sample of the fruit. "Oh, dear. It says it has an enzyme that is attempting to digest you from the inside. The humans call it a Pine Apple."

Julix continued to eat as she fell to the floor. "Still worth it."
