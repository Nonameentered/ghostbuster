Julia didn't know what to do when she found the proof, but at least she knew who to go to. Jim, her longtime partner, and now, deservedly, her boss had an open door policy. And a fully stocked bar.

"Wow, Julia. You look like you could use a drink." This was true, though not a feat of perception on Jim's part. He said that any time she entered his office after three in the afternoon. Jim barely waited for the nod before turning to mix up a pair of his favorite drinks, a Rum and Rum, dark and light. Julia often insisted that the dark rum be replaced with Coke, but not today.

Julia downed it in a single gulp and set her glass out for another. "Whoa, Julia. What's wrong? Perhaps you should slow down and talk to me." While he said this, he poured the second drink.

"You remember those cultists, right? The Shining Circle. Not the hangers-on, but the core group that we took down last year?"

"Jeez, Julia. You know we swore not to talk about that. Let me shut the door at least."

The Shining Circle had been on the Anti-Extremist Squad's wanted list for twenty years before they found them all. Julia still had nightmares about what she'd seen. The hallway of their hidden compound had been a parade of mutilation, bodies strung out for their arcane rituals. She could still feel the heat from the fire that had burned the place to the ground. Jim had stood by her as the pounding on the door slowly subsided, but the chain and padlock had held.

Julia took a slower drink this time. "Jim, did you ever look into what they were doing in there? Do you have nightmares?"

"I saw quite enough of it. My nightmares are about what they did, not what we did, if that's your point."

Julia took a sheaf of papers from her pocket and laid them out on the desk. "You never read their manifesto?"

Jim snatched it up. "Of course I read it. We were after them for twenty years. Where did you get this, Julia. These were all supposed to be destroyed." He shoved it into his desk drawer and locked it.

"It was on the Dark Web. The cyber team found a copy while investigating something else. They flagged it for my attention."

"Well, thank you, Julia. I'll make sure these get tracked down and scrubbed. The last thing we want is the Shining Circle starting back up again."

"I already did that. We took over the server, some old thing that was sitting online still in one of their old warehouses. I was able to date the copy on the server. It had been up since before our raid. Unchanged."

"Well, that's good news at least. Nobody new involved then."

"That's not good news. You don't remember from reading it? The predictions? It talks about the election last year. And the wars, that thing with the panda and the apple sauce, the attack on the award show. All things that happened after the raid, after it was written."

"Somebody has been updating it then. We'll have to track them down."

"Jim, you don't understand. The train crash from last night was in there. I printed that out three days ago. The predictions are happening. I've been looking into it. The Shining Circle was trying to stop the end of the world with their horrible sacrifices and now it's coming. The Mad God coming to take over the world. Just like they said. They were right."

Jim set down his glass. "Julia, of course they were right. Why do you think we killed them?"
