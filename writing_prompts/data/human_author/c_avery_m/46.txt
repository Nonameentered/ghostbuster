"That's no moon!" Half the scientists in the observation lounge chuckled at Julian's joke. The other half had heard it the first time he said it, on their approach to Mimas, Saturn's innermost major moon. When viewed from the right angle, the moon's large crater did indeed make it look like the Death Star.

"The seismic mapping disagrees with you, Julian." A dry riposte from Tarq, the chief planetary geologist on this mission. Tarq was floating upside-down with respect to everyone else in the lounge. While there was no reason to adopt a particular orientation in the weightless section of the craft, most of the crew would politely adopt the position of whoever was already in the room.

Their orbit brought them up to Enceladus next. They'd already landed on that salty ocean globe and spent a month drilling past the ice. The biggest disappointment of their trip was finding not a speck of life.

"That's no moon!" Julian had timed the joke perfectly to break the somber mood. For the next ten minutes the rest of the crew broke up into Star Wars quotes. A consensus grew to recommend renaming the moon to Hoth until some idiot pointed out that they hadn't found any Tauntauns, which put everyone back into a funk.

Iapetus came into view next, the yin-yang moon with its distinctive light-dark color pattern, and their next landing target.

"That's no moon!" Julian failed to get any laughs this time.

"The joke's played out, Julian. Besides, this one should have been a 2001: A Space Odyssey joke."

"Tarq, that was set around Jupiter."

"Only in the movie, Julian. The original book used Saturn, and this moon right here. Though we are sixty years too late to match the book."

The scientists focused on the Iapetus as it continued to grow in their view. Their designated landing crater was still on the far side of the moon.

They were so engrossed that only Tarq saw the object accelerating towards them from Galactic North. As it suddenly matched their velocity, he exclaimed, "That's no moon!"
