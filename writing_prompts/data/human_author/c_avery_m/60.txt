Halbert checked the station timecode before letting the docking port lock into place. Five minutes had passed. That was good. The computers were happy with that amount of time. They cheerfully let their quantum states collapse to a point where they agreed that five minutes had passed for them, too. Just before, if you had asked them, they might have answered that the mission had lasted a billion years or a nanosecond or negative time. But they were happy to accept five minutes.

Halbert's own mind took a little longer to accept the five minute timeline. While he and David were powering down all the temporal generators, he felt he could still remember the whole billion years. There had been a lot of games of parcheesi and endless rations of beef stroganoff and long cold nights cuddling in the bed with David. But, as the last generator spun down, he looked at the ration stock and saw that it was untouched. It had only been five minutes, he told himself. No time to eat anything.

David patted him on the back. "Congrats, Captain. It was a success. Now I'm going to let you deal with the crowd." David exited through the side door.

Halbert unstrapped himself and squeezed through the small hatch connecting the ship to the space station. Every cubic inch of the experimental ship was jammed with equipment and he had to twist his body unnaturally to worm his way out. Station Commander Julia Hernandez was the first to greet him as his head floated through the docking ring.

This was followed by a barrage of flashes from the cameras. The lighting on the station was perfect, but the journalists felt it was their sacred right to flash extra light in his eyes. "Made it seem more historically significant," they would all say. The zero-g drone that was recording the official live stream of the event had to duck between them for it's shot.

Some arcane priority system among the journalists decided who got the first question. "Tim Dodd here, EA news. Captain Halbertson, can you give us your first impressions on returning from the edge of time and space? What's it like to see the stars beyond Sol?"

Halbert took a minute to orient himself to align with the station's designated vertical and push most of the floating microphones away from his face before answering. "It was one more step for men, one final giant leap for humankind. Though David and I didn't actually take any steps. Not enough room in there to move around. But the stars, they were amazing. It's like my eyes are still full of them. I could see the whole future of humanity."

"Who's David?" asked one of the reporters in the back.

Halbert laughed. "Who's David? My co-pilot. And husband. David — uh — Davidson. He should be right..." Halbert turned and looked back at the docking hatch. The ship didn't have a side door.

Commander Hernandez cut in. "Good one, Hal. Dave's the computer, everyone. Hal and Dave. It's a little inside joke that your research departments can figure out for you."

Halbert grabbed the Commander's arm. "No, I remember him. We were married. All those years..."

The Commander signaled to the station crew to start herding the reporters. "If you'll all excuse us, there will be time for more interviews later after the press conference, but the Captain has to get to his mission debrief."

As the Commander tried to lead Halbert away to the medical examination room, he turned back to the docking ring. There, floating out from the ship, was a single piece from a parcheesi set.
