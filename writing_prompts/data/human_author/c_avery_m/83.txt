They thought they had struck oil. They weren't an oil drilling crew, of course. Nobody would expect to find oil in the granite layers of the mountainside. Water was what they were after. Nonetheless, it gushed a hundred feet into the air from the borehole and fell on the drilling crew like rain. It took them a couple minutes to realize it wasn't black oil, but a deep red liquid that began to clot around the hole. Then they heard the screams.

At first the sounds were unintelligible, but when the hole stopped spewing forth liquid and the screams settled down into mere shouts. By the time the drill head was removed they could almost make out words. The camera they sent down showed an unnatural cavern with a smooth flat ceiling, filled with the liquid. Floating bound in the liquid they found the source of the screams.

Professor Julia Hernandez didn't know why the government wanted her, but the university wasn't going to turn down the grant money. As the silent humvee chauffeur drove her, she amused herself by making guesses. Her first guess was some ancient shipwreck, but that started to seem unlikely when they turned up a mountain road. Some cache of stolen artifacts perhaps, sold off by some warring faction in the middle east. Nothing native to the area, at least. Her expertise in ancient Hellenic languages would not help with any local excavation.

When they arrived at the tunnel into the mountainside, the first thing she noticed was that the road was red. None of the surrounding rock or dirt was that color, but dried rivulets streaked down the roadway for half a mile from the entrance of the tunnel.

The wordless driver handed her off to an equally wordless soldier. A corporal, or maybe a captain, she thought, though she was no expert on the uniforms. He took her up the tunnel, which was well lit with a string of work lights. Several other large cables snaked along the side bringing in power from the generator. The floor was sticky, more of the red, but she had worn her fieldwork boots so she paid little attention to it.

The tunnel broke through into a high walled room, floodlit and with red puddles covering much of the floor. A group of soldiers waited for her, watching her face, expectantly. She raised her eyebrows at them, wondering what secret had them snickering to themselves. One of them pointed to her left. The reaction on her face when she looked was what they had come to see.

Until it moved she thought it was a statue. A giant, towering three times her height. It was smooth all over, untarnished silver with red streaks matching the puddles. Roughly human in proportions, but with the round feet of an elephant and hundred-fingered hands. It was bound to the rock with chains. The chinless face turned to her and spoke. "Μπορεί αυτός να με καταλάβει;"

"Well, professor, can you translate?" She jumped when the man beside her spoke. Judging from the amount of brass on his clothes, she assumed he was a general or an admiral.

"I think it asked if I could understand it, though it's accent is odd," she said, turning back to the creature. "Ναι σε καταλαβαίνω."

The creature showed an expression that could perhaps be interpreted as a smile. She translated: "Finally, my children. For so long have I waited, bound by my brethren for daring to create you, to raise you up from your savagery. It is I, Prometheus. Free me, my children and together we shall have justice against those who have oppressed us."
