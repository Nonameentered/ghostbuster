"Well, you see, Miss Julia, we do not typically give tours of the school." The headmaster was ancient. So ancient that Julia could not tell which marks on his face were wrinkles and which were scars. He stood blocking the doorway holding a staff in one mangled hand as if he thought he was going to have a say in the matter.

"No doubt you received the letter from my father, the Minister. It made the request quite clear, I believe." She had in her pocket a more formal order for the inspection of the school, but her father had advised her not to use it unless necessary. It was best to maintain the veneer of choice, especially when dealing with Magicians.

"It is only out of respect for your delicate nature, Miss Julia, that I hesitate. Our students, especially those early in their training, can be quite— jarring."

"You will find my nature anything but delicate, Headmaster. We shall proceed." She walked forward, forcing the headmaster to quickly turn and follow her. As she reached the threshold of the school, the air resisted her slightly, pressing her skirts firmly up against her legs, but she pressed through it with a jerk. She realized that she could no longer hear the traffic from the street outside. In its place was a regular staccato of screams.

Julia turned to the headmaster and raised one eyebrow. He refused to meet her gaze. "You are aware, no doubt, Miss Julia, that a Magician's magic is always related to some trauma that they have experienced. The stronger the trauma, the more powerful a Magician may become. The screams— well— some of the children have lasting effects."

He gestured for her to follow and walked through the entry atrium. In the center, facing the doorway was a painting of the headmaster as a much younger man. Looking at it, Julia realized that all of his wrinkles had started as scars. They passed out of the atrium into a hallway of doors. Next to each door was a window looking into a small classroom. The headmaster stopped next to the first.

"This is where we teach fire magic." The headmaster didn't meet Julia gaze but gestured at the window. The room was bare, with a single metal table in the center and blackened walls. A red-robed fire mage stood with a lit candle in one hand and a strong grip on a young student in the other. The child struggled as the mage held his hand to the flame. The scream was not muffled by the window.

"Worry not, Miss Julia. The burns will be fully healed. We've come quite a long way since my days as a student." The headmaster stretched out his own deformed hand as he spoke.

Julia turned away from the window. "It was my understanding that the students gained their magic from trauma they experienced before coming to the school."

"Oh, yes. We don't accept any that don't already have the spark. But their abilities must be further developed. They must learn multiple types of magic."

Julia rushed down the corridor looking in each window. She saw blades, tubs, chains, darkness, and other things she had not the imagination to determine the use of. She turned back to the headmaster.

"They are just children. Isn't it too much for them?"

"We almost never have to resort to the collar anymore. Mad Mages are mostly a thing of the past. A much bigger danger is that they will fail to develop sufficient abilities, despite our most strident efforts. Since they are mostly orphans they would often end up on the street in those cases. We cannot allow that, of course, but we have a very nice island on which to release them." The headmaster was interrupted by screams three times while speaking.

Julia stood silently for a minute thinking about what to say. No one in society would have guessed the state of this school. She turned to the old magician.

"Headmaster. I have seen enough. I would like to enroll my daughter."
