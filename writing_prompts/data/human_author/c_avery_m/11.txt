"I want to be rich and famous. I want to be surrounded by beautiful women." Those had been the first things out of my mouth. If I'd known the clown wasn't joking I would have worded things more carefully. The way the nose honked at me after each sentence still haunts my ears.

"Can you open my bag for me, Nurse?" She was beautiful, like all the rest of them. I don't remember her name.

"Sure thing, Mr. Tarquin, as soon as I finish changing this IV. Is there something you need?" Her scrubs were just tight enough to tell that she was shapely underneath without actually being enticing. It wasn't funny.

"There's a red ball in there. A clown's nose. Could you hand it to me?" I squeezed my right hand to show her where I wanted it. I could move that arm a little.

She had to bend over the bed to hand it across. I ignored the pain as she brushed against the traction device holding my body in place. "There you go, Mr. Tarquin. Oh, your lawyer came by while you were sleeping. He couldn't stay, but he left those papers on the table for you. He didn't tell me specifics, but he said it was good news on the settlement. You're rich now."

I didn't glance at the papers. The lawyer had said I'd probably get all the monetization money from the video, and all the prize money, plus penalties. I didn't smile. It wasn't funny.

The nurse waited for me to acknowledge her before she turned to leave. "Hit the call button if you need anything. I'll leave the television on for you. They showed your video again last night. You won the Grand Prize on America's Funniest. I can't believe that I have such a famous patient." She switched it on and walked out before I could stop her.

The television was showing the third hour of some inane daily morning show. I reached over to turn it off. She'd placed the remote near my left hand and I had to strain to reach it. My cast knocked against the remote and it fell to the floor.

I swore to myself as the daily show started a new segment. "It's time for our weekly funny video roundup," one of the hosts said while swinging around a glass of her morning wine. "Oh, there are some good ones today."

"No!" I choked out a shout. I knew what they were going to show. "I just want to be left alone."

"Honk."

I jerked my whole body as the clown nose pulsed. It bounced out of my hand, right at my face. If it landed on my nose I wouldn't be able to remove it with both my arms in traction. I twisted my head up to avoid it and it lodged in my open mouth. I couldn't get it out.

I couldn't breathe. I pounded on the call button. The television started playing the video I knew would be there. I heard a laugh from out in the hall. They weren't coming. It wasn't funny.

They played my video on a loop while my sight went dark. Me, wearing that goddamned clown nose when that ball comes out of nowhere and smashes into my crotch. The loop always cuts off right before I fall down the stairs.

It wasn't funny.
