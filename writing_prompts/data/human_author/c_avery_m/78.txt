"You can't sleep here," Rolf said to the young man sprawled out on the pile of hay outside the tavern. "Hey you," he said, giving him a gentle kick.

The youth slowly roused himself and blinked at Rolf. Rolf nudged him again with his foot. "You're finally awake. Go home, it's not safe here."

"Fuck off, Rolf, I can take care of myself. I'm an adventurer. If anybody messes with me I'll stick 'em with a knife."

He recoiled at the blast of ale breath coming from the boy. The youth tried to settle back to sleep, but Rolf knew that if he kept talking eventually the boy would get up and go home. "You know, boy, I probably never told you this, I don't tell many people, but I was a lot like you. I used to—"

"Yeah, yeah. I've heard it a hundred times. So has everybody else in the goddamn village. I'm pretty sure that even the goats are tired of your stupid made up stories."

Rolf stopped smiling. "If you don't get up out of that hay and go home you'll find out for yourself how true they are."

The youth reluctantly got up and left, and Rolf continued circling the village square, checking on any strange sounds in the night. It was nearly sunup when he heard the galloping of a horse approaching.

A swift black gelding rode in out of the darkness, entering the circle of light from Rolf's torch. As the rider reined in, Rolf looked them over. A tall adventurer, girded in bloody plate armor, swinging around a sword that would be worthless on horseback, long blond hair, also spattered with blood, flowed out of their helmet. They jumped off their horse and sheathed their sword.

"You. Guard. Alert the villagers." The voice was high and sweet, a strange match for the patterns of red dripping down her chest. "They must arm themselves, for Rathgar the Bold is coming."

"Rathgar the Bold? I had heard that he was long dead. I've always regretted not being there to see it. You see, I used to—"

"Well, you'll get your chance today, guard. Rouse the village." She turned and began to loop the horse's reins around a post near a water trough, loosely so that she would be able to remount in a hurry.

Rolf hobbled to the bell in the middle of the square. Three quick rings, a single shout, and no further waste of time. Everyone in the village would know what that meant. He then went to arm himself further.

When he returned the villagers were already setting up barricades. Most had spears and bows, far more useful in this fight than the adventurer's sword. In the distance a dull roar could be heard.

Rolf positioned himself in the center of the defenses, next to the adventurer. As he strung his bow, the woman started to shout orders to the villagers.

"Quiet now. The villagers don't take your orders. They can deal with this themselves. I trained them myself. You've already done enough bringing it down on them." The roar had gotten closer, it was clearly recognizable as the stomp and clang of an approaching band now.

"This is more dangerous than you know, guard. In front there is Rathgar the Bold. He'll cut your friends to shreds without me here to direct them."

Rolf nocked an arrow, and waited for his chance. "I know Rathgar. I owe him back for an old injury. I've been waiting a long time for payback. Now, unless you plan on jumping the barricade, I suggest you sheath that sword and pick up a spear."

The horde was at the edge of bow range now. Rolf aimed and loosed an arrow at it's leader, a tall and fearsome marauder. Rathgar the Bold stumbled and fell as it pierced his leg.

The adventurer at his side gasped. Rolf smiled at her. "You see, I used to be an adventurer like you, then I took an arrow to the knee."
