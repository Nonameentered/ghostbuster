My necklace has been passed down through my family for generations, the last artifact of the Land-That-Was, the only reminder of our great, lost civilization. My Great-grandmother always called it the Crown Jewel, a rainbow teardrop whose color shifted in the light and shone softly whenever the wearer felt joy.

I wear it every day.

I wear it today, in the marketplace, as I go to buy bread and onions for today's dinner. I haggle out a price with Joon, the onion seller. We've known each other for years but it wouldn't feel right not to haggle. The onions are a little small today. We have just agreed on a price when a large, meaty hand clutches my wrist.

"Where did you get that?" The voice is deep and raspy. I struggle to pull my wrist out of their grip before I look at them. When I see them I freeze. They are not from our village. Not from any of the villages in our poor country.

The mysterious stranger wears a wide brimmed hat, casting a baleful shadow over their face. Swirls of white pigment streak across their cheeks, giving them the appearance of a fierce warrior. The skin beneath the pigment was mottled but unscarred.

"What do you want?" I cry as I finally pull my wrist from their grip.

"That necklace. Where did you get it? Do you even know where it's from?" The stranger pointed their thick fingers at my neck. Their arms were huge, though whatever muscles they had were concealed beneath an oversized silk shirt.

No one outside my family had ever recognized my necklace before. The story that we had passed down was that everyone else from the Land-That-Was had perished. But if this mysterious stranger knew the jewel they could only be a remnant of our lost civilization— Or of the force that slew it.

I held one hand to my neck. The snarl on the stranger's face seemed cruel, but not violent. I would have to risk conversation to feel them out. "It is very old, a family thing. How do you recognize it?"

"I don't need the story. I know more than you, little girl. Far more. Give it here." The stranger opened a bulging pouch strapped to their belt and pulled out an equally bulging purse. "A thing like that was not meant for you. I can put it in its proper place."

The stranger started to count out money. "No, I won't sell it. Tell me who you are."

"Listen, little girl, tell me where you got that necklace or I'll have you arrested for theft."

The stranger lunged at me, trying to grab my wrists again. I ducked under their arms and ran into the crowd. I knew that I should be scared, but this was the day my family had awaited for generations. Proof perhaps that not all the Land-That-Was had perished. The necklace shone with my joy.

Joon watched as little Julip ran off pursued by the toddering sunburnt fool trying to zip up their fanny pack. She sighed. "Fucking American Tourists..."
