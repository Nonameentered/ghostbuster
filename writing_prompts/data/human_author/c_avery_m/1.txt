The floor creaked. This annoyed Death. Not so much that it happened. She had gotten used to that. What annoyed her was that it should be impossible. As an insubstantial avatar of the afterlife she could not in the course of her duties affect the living world farther than was required to collect souls. But the floors always creaked. Management had refused to give a satisfactory answer in such a way that Death got the impression that they didn't know.

She blamed wood. Back in the day, dirt floors never creaked, nor stone. When people got all enamored with tile floors she would occasionally step on a loose one that would rattle, but nothing like these Management-damned wood floors. People should have the decency to die outside.

Death checked the day's list. It was short. She had a vague sense that other aspects of her presence had other lists, some longer, some shorter. And a vast, incomprehensible sameness dealt with the majority of passings. But she was Primary. She dealt with the important ones. Not the famous ones, nor the historical ones, nor the rich ones, though some might be all three of those, her list only contained those deaths that the universe cared about. The car accident that causes a crucial traffic jam. The fruit seller who died by fire. The mother who orphans a future inventor.

The first name on her list was coming up soon. Falling down the stairs. Simple enough. She found a spot on the floor that wouldn't creak. The fat man waddled down the hallway wearing jogging shorts and a tank top that most beings would consider an eyesore. Death had seen worse. Much worse. Just as he reached the top of the stairs a kid ran out with a mop and placed a yellow cone on the floor.

"Sorry, sir. The stairs are closed. You'll have to take the elevator." The kid didn't have a bucket. The kid didn't work here. The kid was the same Management-damned kid she'd seen three times yesterday.

Death stepped forward and brushed the waddler's shoulder as he stepped into the elevator. The massive heart attack would knock him over before the doors opened in the lobby.

Then Death turned towards the kid and did something she hadn't done in an Age. She appeared.

"What—" She cleared her throat. She hadn't talked to a mortal in a while. "What do you think you are doing?"

The boy wasn't scared when he looked at her. That was strange. She hadn't done this in a while, but she remembered that they were usually scared. She looked down at her hands. A little wrinkled, but they looked human. She wore a silk gown that had been considered very fashionable the last time she'd appeared in it, which as she recalled was about seven centuries ago. She'd forgotten to change her shape back after that party. She'd forgotten that she'd gone to that party. It had been a real good party.

"Why, nothing, Ma'am. Just mopping the floor." The boy moved the dry mop back and forth a bit.

She pinched the bridge of her nose. "You're— you're not very good at this lying thing, you know? Many mortals think they can lie to me, but I always know their truth. You were trying to save the life of that man. The one who was to fall down the stairs."

The boy's eyes widened. He froze for just a moment before throwing the mop at her head like a spear. Death did not enjoy getting a face full of dry yarn. She grabbed it by the handle and sighed when the handle creaked. By the time she threw the mop to the floor the boy was sliding down the banister towards the lobby.

She shifted herself downward and caught the boy by the shoulder as he landed on the ground floor. "Many— many have tried to outrun me. It never works."

He tried to pull away but her grip was icy. She turned him so that he faced the elevator, where a small crowd had gathered. The waddler's corpse could be seen between their legs.

"Four— four deaths have you sought to prevent. And four times have you failed. You can not prevent what is foreordained. Why do you seek to change fate, boy? These deaths are more important then you can possibly know."

The boy looked her in the eyes. "You mean you don't know? You're not from the future, too? If I don't stop at least one of these deaths, we'll all die. The plague will get us all."

Death always knew the truth, and the boy spoke truth. His words opened her to the knowledge of the deaths he had seen. She had seen many, many deaths. She had seen plagues. But what he had seen was an end. Never before had she seen an end.

She kept hold of his shoulder when she shifted. "Come— come on, we'll go speak to Management."
