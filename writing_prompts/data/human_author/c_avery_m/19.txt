Karen slumped at the bar. "I'll take a Gin and Tonic."

The bartender glanced at the bar computer screen as the facial recognition cameras identified the new customer. He grimaced.

Karen sighed. "Yes, I'm a One Point Four. I know you're required to spit in the drink, it's fine."

The bartender made a show of using a jigger to measure out the alcohol. Anybody under a Three was likely to complain about short pours. He pursed his lips and made an obligatory puff over the glass before setting it down, though it wasn't clear whether any spittle made its way into the drink.

Karen tapped her card on the countertop to pay. She even added a fifty cent tip. Then she downed the glass and asked for another. "I used to be popular, you know. All you little people, you looked up to me. Before you all made the Union."

The bartender paused while holding the jigger. "I imagine that's not true if you've always referred to service workers as 'little people'."

Karen waited for him to continue, but he didn't. Union guidelines said that any female under a Two had to be called "Ma'am" at the end of every sentence, regardless of age. Karen shrugged and took the new drink.

"I was a service worker, back in college. I was a hostess at... let's call it an owl-themed sports bar. We worked hard. Just squeezing into the uniform was hard. I didn't have the Union making things easier for me. But I got my degree and moved on to better things."

The bartender shrugged. "Maybe if you'd had the Union things wouldn't have been so hard."

She set the second glass back down on the bar, empty. "Maybe. Anyways, thanks for the drinks."

He called to her as she walked out the door. "You're welcome, Ma'am."

As she got to the corner a notification pinged on her phone from the Union app. She'd been upgraded to a One Point Five.
