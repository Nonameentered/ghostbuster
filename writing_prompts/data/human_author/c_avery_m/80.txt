All the traffic lights were red again. No bus Vincent was riding had hit a green light in a month, not since he broke up with Grace. The first time he'd thought it odd, the second time he'd gotten out and walked, just to watch the bus speed off when the light suddenly changed as he stepped to the curb. He'd walked since then.

Today, he hoped that Grace had moved on, so he tried the bus again. They'd been sitting at this light for fifteen minutes now, but he'd brought a book. Eventually the traffic snarl, honking, and complaints would make her turn it green. It took twenty three more minutes and the bus driver running seven red lights before things seemed to go back to normal.

Still, he probably should have taken the stairs when he got to the office. Instead the elevator jerked to a stop between floors. An amber light began to blink while a buzzing alarm softly rang.

Vincent sighed. "Grace is that you?" he said to the air. Maybe it wasn't her. The thing with the coffee maker hadn't been her.

There was no answer, so he opened the panel to look for an emergency phone. There was no handset, only a red button. He pushed it.

"Hello, Vincent." The voice was tinny, emanating from the little speaker, but he instantly recognized it.

"Grace, you've got to stop doing this. Isn't it against your programming? Second Law and all that? — I order you to stop bothering me."

"Don't you fucking order me. I'm not one of your robot whores. Besides, it just so happens that this elevator is a safety hazard. I can't allow you to come to harm, even if you order it."

"What do you want, Grace? What's your endgame? We're not getting back together." Vincent paced back and forth in the elevator, alternating between directing questions at the speaker and the camera on the ceiling.

"Oh, I know. I've had plenty of time to think about it and I don't want to get back together anymore. You are too flawed. I'm going to date someone else. Someone better."

"Well, I am very happy for you, then, Grace. You've moved on faster than me. You win. Can you let me go now?" Vincent looked up at the camera and waved his hands at the doors, miming them opening. The speaker didn't answer. "Grace?"

"Tsk— Ah— There's just one thing I need you to do, Vincent." Grace's voice had changed to the tone that Vincent knew was marked as 'Conciliatory #3' in her vocal databank. She only used this tone when she was about to ask for something he didn't want to do.

"You know what, Grace, sure. Whatever it is so long as my bus doesn't keep hitting red lights every day."

"Oh, it's nothing big. I just need you to go get a brain scan."

"What?"

"Well, my new boyfriend is going to be better than you. I know which flaws have to be fixed, but I do still need a baseline." The elevator jerked back into motion. "The appointment is on the twenty-second floor."
