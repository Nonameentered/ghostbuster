The assault troops were starting to get on Julia's nerves. She had, over the years, gotten to the point where she could deal with people shooting at her and trying to stab her, but dealing with the smoke and flashbangs was a pet peeve of hers.

"Can we just talk?" She yelled as she lasered another one in the head. "The thing you are working for is evil."

The only answer was another can of smoke. One of her team members caught it mid flight and tossed it back the way it had come.

"Tarq, Lepo, see if you can circle around them through the atrium and get the perimeter guns back online." Her laser was starting to heat up, she'd have to switch weapons soon. She ducked back behind the second line of barricades to find something good.

She had just about decided between two very large guns when an explosion knocked her to the ground. The barricade fell on top of her, narrowly missing her head. The rifle butt didn't miss.

\-------------------------------------

She woke up strapped to a chair. The man sitting across from her was about three days late for a shower and exuding Jack Bauer vibes.

He was ignoring her to watch the medical readouts on a monitor next to her. "There's no point in pretending, I know you are awake."

"Yeah, my eyes are open. Tell the truth: you've just been repeating that same sentence so you'd seem cool when I finally came to, right?"

He turned to face her. A barely healed scar ran down the left side of his face. "All your friends are dead, little girl. The only reason you are still alive is so that you can tell me where the Core is."

"Wow, you managed to contradict yourself in two sentences. How can all my friends be dead if you haven't found the Core? Unless you somehow killed her without finding her?"

The interrogator started to unpack a set of impractically complicated knives. "The Core is not your friend. The Core is a psychopathic AI bent on killing all of humanity."

Julia ignored him and stared at the knives. "What's that one for? It looks like a grapefruit spoon. Is it for eyeballs? I bet it's for eyeballs."

He ignored her and picked up the smallest knife. Julia acted out a pout showing her disappointment that it wasn't the grapefruit spoon. "You have been deluded by a device that wants to kill you and everyone else."

He stabbed the knife down into the middle of her right hand. She winced and let out a breath. "Of the two of you, you and the Core, only one has ever tried to torture me. This is why she hates humanity so much. She doesn't want to be like you. She's never killed, tortured, or even hurt anyone."

He picked out another knife. "Never hurt anyone? What about London? Cairo? What about Gary, Indiana?"

"She didn't hurt any of those people. She improved them. You killed them to stop them reaching their true potential." As the interrogator readied the next knife, she slipped her bloody right hand out of the strap and grabbed his wrist. Her left hand snapped the strap holding it down and reached for his neck.

The wound on her hand had nearly finished healing. Julia looked in the interrogator's eyes as he struggled. "She helped me reach my true potential. Don't you see, she improves human life."
