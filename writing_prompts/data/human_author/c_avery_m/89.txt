The war was going badly. Kevin from HR and his invisible gnomes had recently managed a major victory, pushing back Julia's sprites from the third floor break room, taking total control of the coffee maker. The gnomes, while weak, bred like rabbits, and the war of attrition was finally taking its toll on Julia's army. She needed new allies.

Julia stuck her head through the open door. "Hey, you got a minute to chat?"

The dark figure looked up from behind his pale wooden desk. "Anything for my favorite sales lady. Any excuse to avoid these spreadsheets, am I right?"

Julia stepped through the portal, flanked by two of her lieutenants hovering at her sides. The fell gateway closed with a loud click behind her. No one would disturb their parley. "So, yeah. Quick question. I just wanted to see if I could get your help on this thing with Kevin? From HR?"

The lord in front of her narrowed his eyes and began to stroke his thin beard. He pulled a small tuft of hair between his long fingers as he pondered her request. Ultraviolet sparks flew from the tips of his fingers into the hairs, giving the room a strong scent of thaumaturgy. "I don't know, Jules. You know I like to stay out of this office politics thing."

She had not expected an easy alliance. Movement caught her eye in the corner of the room, as the purple leaves of the office plant rustled. The plant was plastic, with a thick layer of dust on each leaf. Hidden amongst it's stalks she could glimpse the claws of it's denizens. He was not called the Lord of the Dragons for nothing. They might be few in number, but the gnomes would fall to them in droves if they joined the fight.

Julia gave the dragon lord a thick smile, but didn't show her teeth. She hadn't been offered a chair, but the need to be seen as an equal compelled her to sit. Her chair matched that of the lord, a pale green vinyl riddled with cracks that squeaked when she sat on it. The sprites alit on her shoulders and wrapped themselves in her hair, covering their pale skin with golden robes. "Well, you know, I thought with this last idea of Kevin's you'd want to do something at least. I mean, you heard about the coffee, right?"

The lord let go of his beard and his eyes grew wide. His gaze met Julia's for the first time as he bent his will to divine her intent. The sickly orbs peered over the top of his horn-rimmed glasses, delving into her soul. Julia struggled to meet the gaze, having to gather her own strength to maintain the connection. "What about the coffee?" The question attempted to burrow deep into her soul.

She leaned over to bring her face closer to his, placing a single hand on the desk between a stack of papers and a sculpture made of small magnets. The magnets shivered, realigning themselves towards the rings she wore. She lowered her voice to a whisper when she said, "Kevin's replacing the third floor coffee machine with a tea kettle. You know how he and his friends don't like coffee. I think he said he was using the office improvement budget."

Across the desk, the man flinched as if struck, breaking the connection between their eyes. He fell back in his chair, placing his head in an unnatural shadow. When he turned back to Julia, all that could be seen were two fiery circles. He slammed his fists on the desk, the soft thud seemed to echo loudly, despite the acoustic tiles and carpeting. The plant in the corner rustled again as two creatures slithered out.

The Dragon Lord arose, pushing back his chair. The dragons spiralled around his legs as they crawled up to encircle his chest, each placing their head on one of his shoulders. "That coffee maker is five year property and has not been fully depreciated yet. And Kevin does not have purchase order approval on the improvement budget."

Julia arose to meet the man as he rounded the desk. She snapped her fingers and the door opened soundlessly. "Then why don't we go correct him, together?"

Julia smiled. Dave from Accounting had joined the fight.
