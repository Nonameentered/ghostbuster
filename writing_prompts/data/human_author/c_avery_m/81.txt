"And that is Sagittarius," my uncle said while pointing up at the desert sky. "The center of this galaxy lies that way, with a giant black hole in the middle. Let your eyes adjust and you'll see the Milky Way."

I'd never been out to the desert before. Never really been anywhere far enough from the city lights to really appreciate the sky. But here, twenty miles from any other humans, there was a certain peace. I didn't notice the occasional howl or hoot from the dark, not with my uncle's soft voice explaining the sky in my ear.

I pointed at the brightest spot I could find. "Do you think we'll ever go there, uncle?"

He chuckled softly. "That's Venus. You've already sent a probe there. At least the Russians have. It's not as nice as Earth. Too hot."

"Oh, what about there?" I said, pointing randomly to another bright spot. "What's that one called?"

He stood silently for a full minute before answering. "Astronomers call that one Schedar or Alpha Cassiopeiae. When I was a kid we always called it... something different. It's funny that you picked that star out of all the thousands your eyes can see."

"Are you alright, uncle?" I said as he got up off the blanket. I think I saw a tear on his cheek.

"Yeah, kiddo. You just reminded me of something, is all. Something I meant to do a long time ago, but have been putting off." He went over to the van, an old volkswagen minibus, and opened the door, splashing light out over the desert and spoiling my night vision. I heard a loud clunk as he messed with something under the dash.

"Come back to the stars, Uncle."

"I hear you, Julia. I heard you before. I'm coming." I heard a low whir begin to come from the van. The other sounds of the desert faded as it filled my ears.

I stood up now. The light from the van was getting brighter. "What are you doing, Uncle?"

He turned to me, backlit by the radiance coming from the vehicle. It almost seemed like some of the light was passing through his body. "It's been fun, but it's time for me to go back home. There is something important there left undone. Thank you for reminding me."

The volume of the whir had increased to the point that I had to strain to hear him. I stood confused while he turned back to the van and shouted "I'll see you around, kiddo."

When he slammed the door on the van, the noise stopped and everything was black except for the large purple afterimage that swam around in my vision. As my eyes slowly adjusted to the renewed darkness I realized that the van was gone. I turned on my phone flashlight and crouched where it had been, but I couldn't even find any tracks.

A howl sounded in the night as I stood up. The only thing left was the blanket and the stars above me. My phone didn't have a signal and I was twenty miles from any other human. "Son of a bitch."
