Thank you!

>What motivates you to write?

Trying to improve my skills. I've always been a worldbuilder in my head, and want to be able to translate those ideas into novels, but I have to work on my technical skills: mixing dialogue with action, using the proper amount of exposition, choosing the correct POV, etc.

>What are some of your favorite genres to play with?

I like Speculative Fiction (SciFi/Fantasy). I find that when I write Science Fiction, I try to do so with a serious aspect, but when I write Fantasy, I make it whimsical. For Writing Prompts, it's fun to play with and subvert tropes, as it allows me to jump right into the story and hold people's attention with a short piece.

>Do you have an author that you admire or look up to?

I love Neil Gaiman, though I don't actually like writing in their style. Recently I've been reading through all the Hugo/Nebula winners (I'm up to 2005), so I just finished \[Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell\] by Susanna Clarke, so that is topmost on my mind at the moment. I really enjoyed how she mirrored the style of Regency-era novels while still making it feel modern.
