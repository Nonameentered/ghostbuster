It didn't work if she looked. She would hold her right hand out to her side, look at the sky and yell 'Tool'. When she clenched her fist it would be gripping the handle of what she needed. A shovel, a screwdriver, a loofah, whatever was appropriate to the task at hand.

This morning, though, Julia was making toast. She liked it very lightly browned, with butter in the morning and peanut butter at night. Taking it out of the toaster, she called for a butter knife. Her hand gripped something heavier than she expected, jerking her to the right. When she looked it was a sword. A glowing sword. With runes and sigils and a blood-red gem on the pommel. The sort of ridiculous and impractical weapon that you'd see on some fantasy show.

She released and watched as it dissolved in the air. She tried again. Another sword. The same sword in fact. She chuckled to herself as she considered the image she made. A little blonde woman, five foot nothing, in no makeup and a blue bathrobe, with a gigantic barbarian sword. Well, she wasn't about to walk all the way over the drawer for a knife, so she cut a patty of butter with the side of the blade and slathered it on. It actually melted pretty well as it came off the glowing sword.

Later, well toasted, as she was dressing for work in her favorite green dress she noticed a loose thread along the hem. Calling for scissors, she was only mildly surprised to get the sword again.

"God, what is up today?" she said to herself as she cut the thread with the ungainly blade. God didn't answer.

The bus was late today. Julia didn't usually smoke before work, but her nerves were on edge after the events of the morning. As she called for a lighter, she was unsurprised to feel the heft of the sword. One of the glowing sigils ignited her cigarette easily before she let the sword dissolve in the air.

As she stood at the bus stop smoking, she stared down the empty road for her bus to show. Her impatience was interrupted by a shout from across the street. She whipped her head to look and did a double take when she saw three tall creatures.

They were â€” Orcs? She didn't know. Rural New Jersey didn't usually get mythical creatures of any kind. They were tall, and armored, and ugly, and vaguely human if you ignored the canine teeth jutting out of their lips to curl towards their flat noses.

Suddenly her morning made sense. She faced the orcs as they charged across the street, stuck out her hand, raised her head to the sky and shouted "Tool!"

Her hand closed around the smooth metal handle of a butter knife.

"God, are you kidding me?" God didn't answer.

The first orc was already halfway across the street. She flung the butter knife at him. It whirled in the air, sinking blade first into his eye. A grunt of surprise was the only sound he made before toppling to the ground. The butter knife and the orc both dissolved in the air.

The second orc was nearly on her, raising a large axe, when she called for another tool. A long bladed pair of fabric shears appeared in her hand. She ducked under the swing of his axe and pushed against his chest. The black armor was greasy and the rancid stench of his flesh made her eyes water. She jabbed the shears up into the side of his abdomen, where the armor had a gap.

The third orc was on top of her before the second had finished dissolving. It knocked her to the ground and jumped on top of her. His foul breath made her gag as his sharp fangs reached for her. She squirmed against him. The grease on his armor made him slippery and she ducked under his arm and rolled away. When she called for a tool, she felt the familiar grip of a lighter. Without looking at it, she flicked it on and tossed it at the orc. The flame struck the black grease on the back of his armor and ignited him instantly.

The flames lasted long enough for Julia to light another cigarette. She looked up at the sky and said, "I bet you think you're funny. My dress is filthy now. I think you owe me a clean dress."

With a crack of thunder, it began to rain.
