Julia did not enjoy being trapped in the lamp. It had been a mistake to wish for power. Falling for a genie power trap was a hasty mistake. She spent her time in the lamp thinking of ways to trick the next fool into freeing her and taking her place.

When the summons came, she was ready for it. Knowing that it was important to give a good first impression and start the fool off balance, she billowed forth from the lamp as a thunderstorm of smoke and lightning.

"What mortal summons forth the all powerful genie!" She chanted loudly in the All-Language of Babel.

"Tweet," came the reply. Staring down, Julia saw her lamp half buried in a pile of rubble. Her velvet box was nowhere to be seen. Holding a small twig in its mouth, poking the lamp repeatedly, was a small bird. A Brown-headed Nuthatch, S. pusilla, if her bird knowledge was correct, which it was, of course, being an all powerful all knowing genie.

Unfortunately, having been locked up in a lamp, her knowledge didn't exactly extend to current events. "Um— Greetings Pusilla. I don't suppose you know what happened to the building that was here? I had a very nice velvet lined box for the lamp, have you seen it around?"

"Tweet." The nuthatch hopped around in a circle.

"Really, the whole city? I don't suppose there are any humans around?"

"Tweet." The nuthatch scratched at the dirt.

The bird's knowledge of current events was also somewhat limited, though she did know a really good source of insects nearby. Julia decided that this was going to be her best chance.

"Okay, Pusilla. I, the Genie Julia Hernandez, hereafter referred to as the party of the second part, do hereby certify that you, Sitta Pusilla, hereafter referred to as the party of the first part, are of sound mind and body and competent to request the standard three wishes."

"Tweet." The nuthatch cocked it's head to the side and stared at the genie.

"Yeah, anything you want. I recommend power. A little bird like you could use the protection."

"Tweet." The nuthatch pecked at the ground.

"Sunflower seeds, fine. Granted. For wish number two, I'd really suggest you ask for power. It'll change your life. You won't have to deal with all these predators."

"Tweet." The nuthatch flapped its wings.

"Ugh— fine. Granted. A full nest full of healthy eggs, every year. But listen carefully here. The next wish is your last one. Say it after me: great personal power."

"Tweet?" The bird turned and looked at the horizon.

"No, better than an eagle. You'd be protected from everything. Infinite power."

"Tweet." The nuthatch found a bug in the dirt and began to eat it.

"Protection from the giant mushrooms? Why do you need that? Mushrooms won't hurt you. You're a bird. You want—". A hot wind cut her off and began to push her cloud of smoke away from the boundaries of the lamp's magic. Julia turned to look at the horizon.

Above the piles of stone, she saw a glowing mushroom cloud. She looked around again at the heaps of rubble in which her lamp lay. Perhaps right now was not the best time to turn back into a human.

"You know what, mushroom cloud protection granted. This concludes our contract. Good luck with that. I'm just going to wait for society to rebuild itself." As a sonic blast rushed towards them, Julia retreated into the magical confines of her lamp.

Sitta Pusilla spread her wings to catch the wind.
