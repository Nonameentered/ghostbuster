"Don't move, Julia, there is a spider on your shoulder. Like, a really big spider." Julia was getting tired of hearing things like this. In all the months they'd spent in the spider kingdom, not one spider had ever complained to Tarquin to be careful because he was perched on a small human.

"It's alright, sis. I actually wanted to introduce you to him. This is Tarquin, my husband." They had been wed under the full moon in the center of the Great Web. A romantic and moving ceremony that involved a lot of butt wiggling. It had been negotiated beforehand that she would not immediately kill and eat him afterward, as some traditionalists still insist is the only acceptable behavior for newlyweds.

Julia's sister smiled, waiting for Julia to let her in on the joke. Julia stood silently, waiting for her sister to realize that she was not joking. After a moment she held out her hand to display the gossamer ring on her finger. Tarquin crawled down her arm to show off the matching leg-band he wore.

"You're serious? Well, then congratulations, I suppose. It's just very sudden. And Tarquin is a... spider? Like, not a shapeshifter or a polymorph or a werespider or a spirit illusion?" Julia's sister was married to an accountant. An ogre accountant, but still the most boring being that Julia had ever met.

"Yes, a spider. A Royal Spider of the Deep Ways, Immortal Master of the Eight-Fold Magic, third in line to the Silk Throne, though he is unlikely to ever sit on it. We met on vacation."

Her sister just stood there nodding. "Well... that's great. Frank just got promoted to head of accounts." She launched into a five minute monologue on the non-adventures of the ogre accounting world. Julia forced herself to appear interested.

"Sounds like you're doing great, sis. But if you'll excuse me, I really have to go find mom." Julia attempted to sidle away, but her sister caught her arm.

"Oh, no you don't. I want to be there when you tell mom she's going to have spider grandbabies."
