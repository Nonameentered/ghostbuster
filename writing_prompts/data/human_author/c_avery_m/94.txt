It was supposed to be a skim through the atmosphere, a few milliseconds of survey time in the lower end of the distortion field. A year passed out there for every second down on the planet. Three months pay back home for less than a second of work. When things had gone wrong she had barely been able to land the ship in one piece.

That had been two minutes ago. Already, everyone she knew back on Earth was dead.

Julia had wasted far too many of those seconds waiting. They'd had plenty of time to design and build a robot ship to come down and snatch her up, rescue her before the entire life she knew was gone. After the first minute she gave up on that idea. Earth had abandoned her.

She took her time getting out of the capsule, hoping a claw would reach down to grab it before she made it to the door. No luck. The light outside was ghastly. The light from the dim primary star strobed. Ordinarily that tiny pinprick would be too distant to warm this world, but the combined light of an Earth year falling every second managed to make it habitable in a strange coincidence. As the planet circled the star in its orbit every minute or so, the light gradually dimmed and brightened.

It was seven minutes before she'd finished testing the air and stepped outside. There were things she would call plants, though none so tall as to be trees, but no obvious animals within eyesight. Perhaps a soil sample would turn something up. At least it would give her an idea of what she could eat.

She walked the area around the craft, trying to catalog the surroundings. Finally, she met back up with a trail of her own footprints, the NASA boot leaving a distinct impression in the mud. She'd gone in a circle.

She stared at the print for a hundred years before she realized it was a different size than her boot. Her own print was next to it, noticeably smaller. The other prints led away from her craft, up to a nearby hill. She ran, following them.

She heard the voice before she got to the top of the hill. "Hey! Who's there!" The voice was familiar.

The astronaut who appeared from behind a low plant was dressed the same as she was, if slightly dirtier. "At last," he said. "It's been a week. Six hundred thousand years. I thought that NASA would be dust long ago."

The face was as familiar as the voice. She'd last spoken to him at breakfast back up on the base. "Tarquin? Did you come to rescue me?"

His shoulders sank slightly when he recognized her. "Oh, Julia. I should have known it was you. There's no way that anyone else could have gotten here. I've been searching the area for you all week."

"All week? I just got here..." She checked her mission clock. "twenty three minutes ago."

"That can't be right, Julia. I came down three months after you crashed. I was supposed to hook your craft and get us both out of here- It didn't work out so well."

"Where's your ship? Did the computer and mission data survive the landing? Perhaps we can pool our data to figure this out."
