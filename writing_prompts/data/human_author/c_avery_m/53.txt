Julia hefted her sword as the goblins horde poured out of the crevices around them. Her band was confident, but the enemy kept coming.

"Back to back, everyone. Leave them no entry!" She yelled to her companions. The Band of Light had lost no battle. They had snatched victory from worse ambushes countless times. Still, she could sense trembling from the weaker members of the crew. "Our quest can not fail. Protect the amphora."

The first black arrow struck her shield as the goblins charged. They were larger than the type they'd faced before. Matte black armor covered their entire bodies, hiding even their horrible fangs. She knocked aside the first spear to reach her and brought her pommel down on the second, shattering the wood shaft. Twirling, she sliced her sword across a group of the enemy berserkers, decapitating two of them.

Julia stumbled as a heavy weight slammed against her back. She turned to face the enemy and saw her lover, Tarquin, splayed out on the dirt, a spear through his side. Black ichor was sprayed across his armor.

"Tarquin, lay still," she said while slamming her sword into the beast that had impaled him. She kneeled by his side, holding her shield above their heads. She watched as his eyes lost focus and his head dropped to the side. "I will avenge you."

Most of her companions had fallen about her. Only Baldur the Strong still fought against the horde, laying out his war hammer against any that came close to him.

"Baldur, to me," she shouted over the din. Pointing to a red helmeted goblin on a nearby rock outcropping she said, "We must charge their leader. The power of the Light will see us to victory."

As she held her sword up to the sky, a dazzling gleam lit the battlefield, blinding all the enemies surrounding her. In a mad rush at the enemy commander, she pushed aside lesser beasts and readied her sword to strike.

As she swung her blade to end the darkness, she stumbled with a sharp pain through her breast. Looking down, she saw the black shaft of a demon arrow coming from her chest. It was the last image she saw before the blackness.

\-------------------------------------------------

The pain burned when she awoke. Bright lights and white smocked surgeons confronted her. She felt a sharp pinch on her arm and the pain went away. "Baldur did it," she said in a slurred voice. As the blackness returned she smiled in bliss.

\-------------------------------------------------

Julia's second awakening was less blissful. She had awoken in a clean white room with a bed and lavatory, fit for a princess, with her wound bandaged and a plate of food and drink sitting on the table beside her.

But the door was locked.

"Some friendly Prince must have given us aid and succor," she said to herself while eating. "But why keep me from my companions?"

She wondered this for an hour until she heard the lock click in the door. She turned to greet her saviors, ready to give a bow, when she saw a large goblin step through the door. She snatched the platter from the bedside table and swung it at the beast's head, but her weak muscles betrayed her and the goblin easily dodged.

"Please sit down, Julia." The beast spoke in the Light Tongue. "I will do you no harm."

"I will not sit idly while you prepare me for one of your blood sacrifices to your demon lord." She flung herself at the monster but it caught her softly in it's claws.

A vile cackle escaped from it's lips. "Demon lord? Blood sacrifices? Oh, Golbur's going to love that one. That's the best one yet. And your companion Tarquin thought we were going to eat you, so that's saying a lot. Blood sacrifices have been illegal for three hundred years. Even the Old Ones just do a symbolic ritual these days."

"Tarquin is alive?" Hearing the name, even saying the name, filled her with hope, but she pushed the feeling out of her face. "Don't try to trick me, you devil. I saw him die with my own eyes."

"Well, he was in worse shape than you. Needed several organ replacements. But he asked about you when he awoke. You'll be reunited with him once he awakens again."

"Why should I believe your lies, beast? You are trying to raise my hopes just to dash them with your foul torture."

"I've been appointed your advocate. If you think me a liar, you will have a chance to ask for a replacement. Now, if you are done with the spitting, I can take you to the rest of your companions." He turned to leave the room and waited for her in the hallway.

"You are letting us go?"

"Oh, most certainly not. I hope to argue for clemency and psychiatric treatment during your trial, due to your brainwashing by the so-called 'Light'. But it will be difficult. You murdered several hundred people on your rampage through the country."
