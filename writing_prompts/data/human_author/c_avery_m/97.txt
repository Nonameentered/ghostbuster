Congratulations, you have a new match!

JuliaHern98: Hey we matched! I like your hair in your profile pic. What do you do to get it like that?

SnakeGurl420: Oh, thanks. I was born with it. It does take a lot of work to keep them from being unruly, though. Uh- your hair is nice, too. Are you from around here?

JuliaHern98: Yeah, I just moved here. I don't know a lot of people yet. I don't really get out much. Mostly just spend time with Lady Snufflekins. She's my cat.

SnakeGurl420: I've never had a cat. I'm more of a snake person, as you can probably tell.

JuliaHern98: Lol, yeah. What about you? Are you from around here?

SnakeGurl420: Originally I'm from Cape Verde, but I spent a lot of time in Greece. I'm sort of an island girl. I moved here a while ago, but I haven't made too many friends yet. I'm sort of hard to get to know. Not to be cliche, but I'm not really like the other girls.

JuliaHern98: Lol. Me neither. Cape Verde sounds cool. Not stalking you or anything, but I just looked it up. I already added a couple books about it to my reading list. I read a lot.

SnakeGurl420: So do you want to try and meet up and do something?

JuliaHern98: Oh, wow. Lol. Okay, here's the thing. I'm not so good at meeting people in person. Do you know what Eye Contact Anxiety is? I have a hard time looking at people directly. It's like a real medical condition thing. I try to tell people about it before actually meeting them.

SnakeGurl420: No, it's cool. I actually don't have a problem with that. You want to pick me up or should we meet somewhere?

JuliaHern98: Where do you live?

SnakeGurl420: I'm on Euryale Street, near the park.

JuliaHern98: Is that the Art Park with all the Statuary? That's on the other side of town from me. Where were you thinking of going?

SnakeGurl420: There's this restaurant, Tiresias, downtown. It's pretty cool. All the waitstaff is blind and the whole thing is pitch black. You have to eat without seeing anything.

JuliaHern98: Lol. Sounds perfect. I can't wait.
