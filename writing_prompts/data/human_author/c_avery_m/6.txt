"And therefore, we, the designated caretaker guardians of the Earth Natural Evolution Zone, do welcome our fellow genetic cousins to the Galactic community with the status of provisional wards." The galactic ambassador had droned on for fifteen minutes in his oddly accented English.

They were human. Julia had trained to expect anything when given the job of Earth's representative. She'd been ready for overeager tentacles and sealed chlorine environments, for odd smells and guttural clicking languages. But the only reason the ambassador in front of her would have turned heads on a busy New York street would be his perfect hair, strong jawline, and the skin-tight silver jumpsuit which revealed a Appollian physique.

Julia blinked when she realized he had stopped talking. She fell back to her prepared remarks. "As representative of Earth, I hope for productive discussions and negotiations regarding our place in the Galactic community. We are excited for this opportunity to learn from each other. We—"

"Yes. I'm sure your input will be interesting. The first forum for discussion of your... situation will be in three rotations. You are, of course, welcome to attend. I will be leading the decision panel, along with others that have a genetic interest. Please enjoy the festivities." The ambassador quickly executed a wiggling bow and turned to begin a conversation with a huddle of other humans in the same silvery jumpsuits.

Julia turned to her companions. "Go... mingle, I guess. I suppose we can assume the food is edible."

She quickly found herself standing alone next to a table filled with piles of what appeared to be small blue vegetables. They tasted a bit metallic. She felt a tap on her shoulder. "If you would follow me, I would desire to speak in private."

A figure in a dark flowing robe had already begun to walk away by the time she turned around. Another human. She'd hoped for a second that it was at least one of the floating orb aliens or hulking shadows that stood quietly on the room's mezzanine. She shrugged and followed anyway.

The figure led her to a quiet niche in the side of the hall. There was another huddle of humans here. Along with the figure in the robe, they were the first she'd seen not wearing those jumpsuits.

The central man was dressed in a blue tabard with a large floppy hat decorated with a large feather. He bowed as she approached, flourishing the hat. "Representative, allow me to introduce myself, I am the Comte de Bon San Jamie, Louis Phillipe Quatramontaine, the Fourth. The Lady to my right is Miss Alice Worthingham. Your illustrious guide is Og, and to my left is William Robert Thurston."

"For the last time, Luey, it's Billy-Bob." The man on the left was wearing what Julia at first took to be denim overalls. As she got closer she realized that it must be made from the same material as the silver jumpsuits, just colored and cut in imitation. Billy-Bob grinned at her.

Julia took them all in. "You're all from Earth?"

The Comte set the hat back on his head. "You are quite correct, mon cherie. True sons of mother Earth, and daughter excuse me Miss Alice, born and bred of the good soil, and wanting to give you a true welcome, unlike those descendents of ours."

"The ambassador is one of your descendents? He gave a very... different impression than you do. How long have you been here to have descendents?" Julia wished she had a drink.

The Comte grimaced at the mention of the ambassador. "The ambassador— He is what we would have called in my native France— allow me to translate from the language of my birth— A total condescending asshole. To be absolutely honest with you, madam, most of the children raised here forget their origins. They could never visit Earth and so they grew up more alien than human. I myself can no longer bring myself to have children here, and have not had one in several centuries."

"I've got a couple still running around somewhere," Billy-Bob said with a grin. "But then, even back home my kids weren't nothing to write home about. Og's got some recent brood, too, but they tend to keep to themselves."

Julia took her first good look at Og. He was short but muscular under the robe, with a prominent brow ridge and weak chin. He nodded and said nothing.

The Comte continued. "You allow me to digress, madam, what we have brought you here to say is that you will not get what you want from the local-born. They will talk over your head and try to make decisions for you. They believe the earth-born to be curiosities to be protected, tucked away where they can do no harm. They will give you no technology, allow you to go only where they deem acceptable, hold you back for your own supposed safety."

Julia looked him in the eyes. "And what do you want?"

"Why to go home, of course. And if you help us, we'll take everything with us that's not nailed down."
