An ear-splitting roar sounded throughout the house. Julia looked up from her newspaper. Darryl was late, but he wouldn't have used the doorbell. "Now who could that be at this time of night," she asked herself.

She took off her glasses and set them on top of the paper. She wormed her way through the piles of gold that littered the floor. The kids were supposed to clean up before bedtime but she'd been too distracted to enforce the rule. She ran a deep red claw over a sigil on the wall and a vertical split appeared in the wall of the cave. A sprinkling of dust rained down while the large stone doors rumbled open.

It took a moment after the doors shuddered to a stop for her to see the two humans standing in the cloud of dust. Both were knights, well appointed in armor, with blue tabards, armed with lances and kite shields. Their horses stood munching grass a short way back up the trail.

The taller of the two stepped forward and issued a challenge. "Is this the home of the Dread Wyrm of Livia, Devourer of Maidens, Destroyer of Fortresses, Desecrator of the Land?"

Julia's eyes shone fiercely as she peered at the intruders. She gripped the stone floor with her adamantine claws and spread her dark wings to block the massive opening. The pattern tattooed on her wings in blood magic glowed and pulsed. She opened her dagger-filled maw and answered the knights. "You mean Darryl?"

The knight's gauntlet trembled as he took a scroll from his sabretache to consult it. "Uh— Yes. Darryl Dracolavic. Dread, Devourer, Destroyer, Desecrator, etc. This is Thirty-four Applebaum Lane, which is the address we have on file for him."

Her sinuous neck twisted in a mesmerizing display as she examined the knights with her shining eyes. She sought out gaps in their armor that her obsidian teeth could pierce. Licking her scaly lips with her snakelike tongue, she answered. "Yes, Darryl lives here. I'm his mother. What trouble has he gotten into this time?"

The knight shifted his feet in the dust, placing himself in a ready stance, the grip on his lance tightened and he held his shield ready to rise between himself and the towering beast. "Ma'am, I am sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but I regret to inform you that—"

"No. Don't say it." The cry was a plea. Julia slumped to the floor. Her wings squeezed against her back as the shine left her eyes.

"I regret to inform you that Darryl Dracolavic was killed during an incident with knights this afternoon at the Tabitha Town Tavern. His final words were a charge to us to inform his family of his love. My oath is fulfilled."

"Your oath, mortal?" Julia rose, her eyes no longer shining with light but with fire. Her fingers clacked as she sharpened her front claws against each other. "He was at the Tavern, having a drink with friends, and some idiot attacked him, looking for glory. Tell me, knight. What are those bumps I see under your tabard? Do you wear the teeth of my son, a talisman to your victory?"

She struck out with her lightning claws. Sparks flew from the knight's armor as she cut through his tabard. Underneath, mounted on a chain of steel, two curved obsidian teeth dangled on his chest. The knight fell back dropping his shield and lance. His companion had turned to flee before he even struck the ground.

Julia snatched the teeth. "For fulfilling an oath to my son you shall live today. But beware. You have earned the wrath of Julia Dracolavic the Justified, Gem Wyrm of Livia, Judge of the Land, Jaws of Destruction. Do not think that you are safe. I shall have your shield for this."

As he scrambled away, running in terror, she roared. When the door closed, she looked at the teeth she held in her claws and cried.
