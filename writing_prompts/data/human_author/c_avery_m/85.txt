"I'm not equipped to fight a dragon," Sir Tarquin insisted to the shopkeeper shilling outside her store. He stayed seated on his riding horse, his charger being led by a servant beside him. "As you can no doubt see," he said pointing to the packhorse at the rear of his caravan, "I have brought only tournament jousting equipment on this journey."

"Oh, I see, no doubt, no doubt, My Lord. And I see as well the laurel upon your brow. A great victory you have surely had at the tournament. It is this only that has made me approach you, for only a great lord such as yourself could afford to equip himself to best the foul beast that has ravaged our land. And only a skillful knight such as yourself could hope to overcome the speed of it's sharp claws." Julia folded her hands in a prayer as she praised Sir Tarquin's ability. He puffed out his chest as she described him.

She continued her sales pitch. "Our king has charged me to stop only those worthy. The equipment in my shop has been consigned by the king himself to be sold only to those able to rid us of this horrible creature. It is equipment not meant for base and low hands such as this village possesses."

Julia saw in his eyes that she had hooked him. With some travelers she had to go on to explain how the village maidens or youthful lads would surely reward the fearsome hero. Sir Tarquin waved over his squire to hold his horse while he went inside.

The shop was a single room, the bed in the back being hidden by a musty velvet curtain. A few items adorned the walls and shelves, but the focus was a single armor stand in the middle of the room. The armor it held was a gleaming mail shirt, fastened all over with red scales. The neck was rimmed with the black claws of a dragon. A helmet hung with it, shining silver with four dragon horns sprouting as a crown. Standing next to them was a broad-headed ebony spear, reaching nearly to the ceiling.

"Feel them, my lord. You will feel the magic flowing through them. The king has told me that the enchantments upon them will make any knight immune to the flames and claws of a dragon, so long as his courage is true. The spear will pierce the hide of the most arcane creature. I have, as well, other items for your squire, a baldric, sword, and shield to stand by your side."

Sir Tarquin strode forward to the armor. "Oh, verily, I do feel the magic. What has your king commanded you to ask for in exchange for this armor."

"A token only, my lord. Twenty gold. A mere deposit to dissuade cowards and charlatans. The true price we ask is the end of the terrible dragon. You will be repaid a hundredfold from the monster's treasury." Julia accompanied this speech with a graceful curtsy and stayed lowered with her knees bent. "Will you accept the quest?"

Sir Tarquin answered with a yell. "Squire, bring my purse. Tonight we hunt a dragon!"

The townsfolk gathered, promising to prepare a feast for their triumphant return. Julia aided Sir Tarquin's servants in fitting him in the armor.

"Careful, good peasant. This claw did scratch my neck."

"Oh, forgive me, my lord. I will leave your servants to help and assist your squire with the baldric. One word of advice, my lord. Mayhaps you should take the rest of your purse with you. The king has said that the dragon could be lured into a trap with the use of gold."

"Your king gives good advice, good woman. It shall be done." Sir Tarquin mounted his charger, leaving the riding horse in the care of his servants. He took up the ebony spear and had his servants attach his pennant to it. He waved to his squire to mount his own horse. "Come, Squire. To glory!" Lifting the spear, he galloped off towards the old cave to which Julia had pointed him.

Julia waved them off and then turned to the townsfolk. "You three, distract the servants. Big John and Little John, go after the knight. Make sure to wait until the poison is finished this time. And make sure to get that charger, it's worth ten times as much as the other horse."

Sir Tarquin's blood-covered pennant would be found the next day, the only token his servants had to return to his estate. And the legend of the Dragon would continue to grow.
