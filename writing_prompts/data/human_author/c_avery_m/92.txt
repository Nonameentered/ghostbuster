Strictly speaking, the colony rules forbade solitary exploration. New biomes were supposed to be cleared by a team of four. But nobody had time to come along babysitting a planetary geologist, especially as they would have been expected to help out breaking rocks and digging by hand. So Julia was alone on the mountainside collecting samples of rock strata for lab analysis when she found the cave.

She nearly stumbled into it. The entrance was hidden in shadow. The local rock was mostly granite, she hadn't been expecting caves. "Hmmm- this could indicate some local tectonic activity," she thought to herself. "I'll have to investigate it."

She strapped on her headlamp and tightened the strap on her rock helmet. The cave looked flat inside but she took along her ropes anyways. A few small animal tracks were patterned across the dirt floor, the four-toed diamonds of most of the local wildlife.

About ten meters in the cave turned and plunged her into darkness. She played her lamp across the wall. They were wet, slick with some local slime, but the floor somehow remained dry. The slime gave the cave a musty odor. Scraping a bit of the slime off showed more granite underneath. The stench of the slime was strong where she had scraped it, making her eyes water.

Stepping deeper into the cave, the roof dropped so that she had to crouch. The cave continued as far as her light could reach in a straight line. The walls tightened and the slime suddenly stopped. The walls and floor were now bare rock. Smooth. A few meters more and it turned into a perfect circle. "A lava tube? No, it's dark but it still looks like granite. I'd better take a sample."

Tck. Tck. Tck. The sharp ringing of her rock hammer echoed through the cave. The rock was hard. Tck. Tck. The sample fell off and hit the floor with a loud clunk. The plastic sample bag crinkled loudly to her ears as she stowed the sample. When the sound continued after it was stowed she froze. The sound was coming from deeper in the cave. A blast of air came up from below, bringing a rotting stench even stronger than the slime.

At the limits of her lamp light, she saw movement. Adrenaline rushed to her heart as she fumbled for her sidearm. The safety strap wouldn't come off in her shaking fingers.

She looked up from her gun to shine her headlamp down the cave. All she could see were teeth and a gaping maw. The creature filled the entire tube. It was fast.

Her scream was cut off when a tooth pierced her lung. The last image in her mind was of a writhing purple tongue. She passed out before the teeth reached her face.
