It was the warmth that awoke me. I like it cool when I sleep, but something was warming up the air of my house. Hot breath and fire, from the smell of it. Some thief thinking that they could come to steal the life savings of an old man. They would find this theft more difficult than they'd hoped. I reached under my bed and brought out a weapon, then crept slowly down the long hall.

I could hear something scratching against the stones as I walked down the hall. More than two feet. I waited around a corner, readied my weapon, and waited for them.

I saw the light from the fire before they turned the corner. It sounded like something large coming, or a whole herd of something.

As the fire turned the corner, I shouted, "Who dares invade my home!"

I turned my weapon to bear upon them. The leader saw me and screamed. "Holy shit, that dragon has a gun!" As he stopped his followers bumped up behind him, causing them to fall into a pile.

"That's right, motherfuckers. I'm tired of you damn dwarves stealing my treasure. You're getting no gold today, only lead." The first shot from my shotgun splattered the leader in the chest. As I pumped it to reload, his companions dragged him back around the corner.

My body flowed around the corner in pursuit, roaring. When I saw them again they had abandoned the leader and turned tail. The injured dwarf whimpered as I ended him with a claw. Turning my shotgun after the fleeing thieves, I let loose another shot. The hindmost two stumbled as the shot peppered backsides.

"Mercy, mercy!" One of them pleaded as my teeth ripped him in twain. The remaining thieves threw their own weapons to the floor to flee faster.

I regret wasting time finishing those two, as the remaining dwarves reached the front door and slipped outside. I think my final shotgun blast into the night hit one of them, I found blood the next day. After I secured the door I turned back to do the cleanup. Fresh dwarf always makes a good midnight snack.
