Steve sat in the captain's chair. Technically it was the watch officer's chair, but he thought of it as belonging to the captain. It was right in the middle of the bridge, surrounded by control panels, and covered in a smooth dark red leather, matching the color of his hair, unlike the rest of the chairs that were black plastic. The chair was oversized. He could comfortably sit cross-legged in it or recline sideways with a leg over the arm, so long as he avoided hitting any of the controls.

And it swiveled. He could point it at any of the screens on the bridge. None of the screens showed anything important at the moment, so the main use he had for the swivelling was to spin around and pass the time until his watch was done. The main screen showed mostly black space with a few stars and a standard nebula. Pretty as a picture, but nothing to hold his attention.

He was relaxing with his eyes closed, definitely not sleeping, when the alarm sounded. He spun the chair around. None of the viewscreens showed any alert. He flicked a switch to bring up a status report and it was all green. The klaxon cut off and the intercom came to life, "Human to the Bridge. Human watch officer to the Bridge."

He clicked the intercom button. "This is Watch Officer Herrington. I am on the bridge. What's the emergency? All my boards are green."

Instead of an answer, he heard the door slide open behind him. Turning, he saw Golbur, the Raxian Second Officer. The Raxian was tall. Seven feet tall, which Steve always chuckled at because the Raxian had eight feet, each with a little hoof. Unlike humans, who were required while on duty to wear tight, uncomfortable uniforms that covered all of their skin below the jaw, the Raxian was naked except for its fur and the gold necklace it used in the place of pockets, around it's giraffe-like neck. A little speaker on the necklace translated as Golbur yelled "Steve, we need you on the Bridge."

Steve raised his eyebrows. "Yeah, I've been on the Bridge."

"No, the Real Bridge. Come on."

This raised some questions with Steve. Questions about what the hell he'd been doing seven hours a day for the past year. But before he could ask any of them, Golbur turned and left, waving his neck to indicate that Steve should follow.

Golbur walked just down the hall and then turned and disappeared through a bulkhead. A bulkhead that Steve would have sworn was the outer hull of the ship. He waved his hand through the hologram, then plunged himself through.

On the other side was a large white room. There was no captain's chair, though the Raxian Captain and several other officers were there. There was no furniture of any kind except for a small plinth in the middle of the room. It struck Steve for the first time that Raxians didn't use chairs.

"Umâ€” What is this place?"

"This is the Bridge, Officer Herrington." The voice came from the captain's speaker. Most of the Raxians used the same generic human voice on their speakers, but the captain had changed his to an authoritative Basso Profundo.

"And the room I was in?"

"That's the Human Waiting Room. I'll explain later. We have a situation that requires your attention." It turned to face the wall opposite the entrance. "Viewscreen."

The entire wall illuminated with a display of the surrounding space. The nebula and stars were there, but unlike Steve's screen, this one showed ships. An entire armada arrayed in front of them. Energy weapons lanced out from them to splash against the ship's shields. "As you can see, Officer Herrington, we are under attack. Ships regulations dictate that in this situation a Human should be called to the bridge to rectify the situation."

"Okay, where are the controls?" Steve looked around the room again. Every surface was a seamless white. Other than the viewscreen, the only spot of color was a bit of red on the plinth in the middle.

"The computer controls most things automatically. The rest is voice controls."

"Did you tell the computer to fire weapons?"

"The computer does not have such a function."

The Raxians were beginning to wave their necks in agitation. For lack of a better idea, Steve wandered up to look at the plinth. The splotch of red was a round button, a large one the size of his hand. "What's this button do?"

"We don't know. Regulations explicitly forbid us from pushing the button."

"The same regulations that say you're supposed to bring a human to the bridge in this situation?" The captain stomped his front hooves in agreement. Steve looked back and forth from the captain to the plinth.

A loud alarm sounded in the room, followed by a quick string of Raxian vocals. Golbur translated for Steve, "The Shields are down to ten percent."

The Raxians began to stampede around the room. Their necks whipped from side to side in panic. Steve looked once over each shoulder, shrugged, and slammed a fist down on the button.

The alarms stopped. When Steve looked up at the display screen, he smiled. As a thousand ships were immolated, a warm glow bathed over his face.
