Golbur inspected the primary dwelling structure as the Builder extruded it onto his assigned settlement location. He called himself a traditionalist and the structure followed the classic pentagonal design. This particular structure was listed in the Builder's catalog as 'Self-contained Dwelling Structure Design Number 0001', though Golbur had left off the optional airlock. It was the first design listed when he had asked the Builder for a house.

Golbur swiveled to get a good look with all five eyes. The Builder was putting the final coating on when an old Coordinator ambled up and indicated it wished to speak. Golbur bobbed his legs in assent.

"You did not add an underlayment to your dwelling structure. You're going to get ants."

Golbur jiggled his eyestalks. "Don't try to play tricks on me, Old One. I know that Ants are a myth."

"A myth that finds our construction compounds delicious. When you awake to find a layer of them consuming your legs in the morning, you will believe."

"I have been here for a full cycle and have not seen any Ants."

"Have you looked down?" The Coordinator plucked something off of Golbur's fifth leg and lifted it up to Golbur's macro eye. Under the enlarged view he saw a single six legged creature struggling to escape the grip.

Golbur took the creature from the Coordinator's grasp and examined it from all sides. It's jaws clamped down on his finger. He yelped in pain as he dropped it. "How does it inflict such pain?"

"They inject acid. One is not lethal, but they come in swarms. The construction compounds attract them."

Golbur looked at his newly completed dwelling. Rebuilding it would cost him several weeks of ration credits. "How do I rid myself of them?"

The coordinator swiveled fully around and ducked its head. When it spoke, it was in a whisper. "I know a human that can do it. Not too expensiveâ€” but employing the remaining humans is still illegal. I believe he eats them. They call him The Exterminator."
