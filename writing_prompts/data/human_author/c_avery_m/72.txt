The hand, the claw, was twisted. Large and twisted. Tarquin could see the spot where the rover had taken a sample out of it. Perhaps he would have taken it to just be an oddly shaped rock, but the analysis had come back saying it was no rock. It did not belong.

Somehow he'd drawn the short straw and been sent out to retrieve it. The scientists were the ones excited about it, but they'd chosen him, a pumped up janitor and gardener, to go out alone on the lunar regolith and haul this creature back. He hadn't wanted to go alone, but the rover wouldn't hold two for this journey. They said they chose him because he was strong and brave and tall, blue eyed and blond, an American Hero. But he knew they'd chosen him because he was expendable. The one person in the base they could do without.

The claw seemed to be pointing at him. A faint alarm sounded in his suit, warning him that his heart rate was high. He fumbled with the controls at his chest to silence it. He unstrapped himself from the rover and bounced over to the claw. When he wiped the dust off of it, he could tell that it was red. Nothing in this environment stayed red for long. The sun had long since bleached the American flag back at base to be White, White and Blue.

He lifted the claw, hoping that it would come up as a small piece and he could go home. He'd tell the scientists that he'd looked for other artifacts and found nothing. No luck. It was attached to a limb under a thin layer of regolith. When he was done dusting the whole thing off, it was an entire body, vaguely man-shaped, red, bloated, and hideous, with a bulbous head laying face down. He turned it over and froze, as the face that stared back at him was his own.

Another alarm sounded in his helmet. He was hyperventilating. He opened his eyes and realized that he'd been cowering next to the rover for five minutes. Slowly, he calmed himself. He couldn't stand to look at the creature. That doppelganger lying in the dust. He threw the tarp from the back of the rover on top of it and wrapped it without looking. It was light to lift in this gravity and he was able to strap it on the back of the rover.

The ride back was a terror. He could hear it whispering to him. "I'm here to replace you, Tarquin. An alien shapeshifter."

He checked his radio. Nothing. There was no air to transmit sound here, so he tried to shake off the hallucination. It continued. "I'm you from the future, Tarquin. Your future is death in the dust."

Purple spots floated in front of his eyes. He checked his oxygen levels. Normal. He kept driving. "I'm from a parallel universe, Tarquin. You die in all possible scenarios."

He was shaking when he pulled the rover into the base's garage. It was barely pressurized when the base personnel rushed out to help him.

Dr. Julia was the first to get to him. "Tarquin, we've got you. You're safe. Why didn't you answer the radio?"

Tarquin gave her a blank stare. "It's me. It's me. The thing, the creature. It is my death. It's face is my own."

Julia gripped his arm. "Yes, we heard you on the radio. That's all you've said for the past six hours. It's alright Tarquin. You're safe."

Tarquin pointed a gloved hand at the back of the rover, where the tarp covered the creature. When they pulled back the cover, his own face stared back at him again.

Julia stared in disbelief. "Are you a fucking idiot? How did you Forrest Gump your way onto this mission? Was the Chinese flag on the arm not a giveaway?" She reached over and raised the mirrored visor on the red space suit. The mummy of a black haired woman stared back out.
