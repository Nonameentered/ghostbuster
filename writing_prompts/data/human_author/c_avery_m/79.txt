"Do you even lift, Bro?" the Stack of Muscles said to Gartain, the Paladin. He turned to his fellow gatekeeper, a Neckless Knot of Muscles. "Look at how puny he is. He he he."

Gartain stood proud in his shining armor, his argent tabard emblazoned with the golden sun of his righteous order. "Good sir, though undoubtedly you are sworn to guard this gate against all evildoers, I do implore you to move aside, for my party and I find ourselves on a quest of great import, a quest for the Holy MacGuffin, and should be we impeded or slowed in our journey, a fell darkness shall cover the land."

The Neckless Knot looked Gartain up and down. "You're right Bro, he's puny. What do you think he weights. Fourteen stone? I could squat two of him."

Gartain's face began to turn red under his helmet. "Good sirs, you do insult me. My holy orders prevent me from throwing the gauntlet, but if you step forward I shall show you the error of —"

Julia the Healer stepped forward, interrupting him by shoving her staff into his hands. "Gartain, let me handle this. I speak Swole."

Gartain failed to grab the staff and fell into his face, clanging against the visor of his helmet. He caught it before it fell to the ground and managed to turn his fumbling into a graceful bow towards Julia. "As you wish, my lady."

Julia walked up to the Stack. "Sorry, 'bout my mate, Bro. He's a crossfitter. He doesn't really get us." She placed a hand gently on his shoulder. "Nice traps, by the way. You do deadlifts for those?"

The Stack gave her a smile. "Nah, I do rack pulls. Five sets of thirty every other day."

"And those calves. It's so hard to get good calves. They are good." She paused for just a second to give him a coy smile and then pointed to the Neckless Knot. "Almost as good as his. I mean, it's close, but his calves edge yours out I think."

The Neckless Knot popped a flex and raised his eyebrows while giving a small head nod. "I told ya, Bro. I told ya. Every day is leg day."

The Stack turned away from Julia and shook his head at his partner. "Nah. Nah. I'll show you up any day, Bro. This chick don't know what she's talking about. She's probably Crossfit like her bro."

Julia let out a feigned gasp. "How dare you. I would never. I have half a mind to let Gartain defend my honor and — No, No. Let's settle this in the gym. You guys got a good one around here, right?"

The Stack pointed through the gate. "Yeah, yeah, but — uh — we're not supposed to leave the gate."

"You'll only be a second. Like one set. Winner takes the title." She grabbed both of the Meat Slabs by the arm and guided them through the gate. Turning back to Gartain, she mouthed, "Run."

"What was that, my lady?"

She widened her eyes at him and gave him a harsh whisper. "Run, you idiot, these Beef Heaps couldn't outpace a tortoise."

The Stack heard her whispering. "Who you calling an idiot?"

Julia shook her head. "Not you, Beef Heap. On second look, your calves actually are better." As the Stack of Muscles turned to laugh at the Neckless Knot, Julia slipped under his arms, grabbed her staff from Gartain and began running up the pathway. As they slipped around the corner, she shouted back "Crossfit Forever!"

The Neckless Knot turned to the Stack and shook his head. "Not cool, Bro. Not cool."
