This led Bob to take on a grand quest from a wealthy kingdom. A final mission like the one where he was betrayed. Only in this last mission would he do the same to his new partners. Bob was going to take down the big bad Necromancer, all a million gold. He planned to take out the nigh unstoppable party members by shooting them from the back. His weapon could take them out in one hit, and afterward, he would blame it on the Necromancer, securing the reward for himself.

Bob thought of a dozen reasons for how he was going to hide the bodies of his teammates as he traveled along. He didn’t want someone to discover his nefarious scheme to kill them. He had other problems for him as well. He couldn’t miss three consecutive shots on the heroes. This means that for his supplies, he had to carry three bullets that were specially made to take out the heroes. The three bullets had to be contained in a special box, and if the party members caught wind of Bob’s plot, he’d end up like he was before.

What wasn’t in the plan was Bob’s feelings. What was originally a stereotype of Bob’s new team started to grow into fondness. Bob thought it would be easy, betray a bunch of assholes and get a million gold. What wasn’t in the plan was that each member of Bob’s team had a personality he grew attached. 

The fighter may be obsessed with the Cleric, but he cares for someone. So one night, the fighter asked for Bob’s help to woo the Cleric. “I feel as if you always have a plan,” The fighter said one night, “can you hook me up with her?” This was shocking for Bob, as no one asked for his help from the other party.

This led Bob to help the fighter, as he couldn’t help wanting to help him. Even though he planned to kill them all, he wanted them to go out happy. Bob went along with the fighter, starting to learn about the Cleric. Bob learned that Cleric shared common ground with him. The Cleric’s lengthy backstory was similar to Bob’s; other parties abandoned her. However, she had a different answer from Bob’s issue. She wanted to prove that she was better off without them, and Bob found himself in her.

Even the Wizard started to grow in the party. There were arguments with him constantly. Most party members began to ignore him, leaving him alone without anyone to talk to, and the Wizard hated that. The Wizard loved conversing with people, and it took one day with Bob telling him that he was a stubborn prick and no one wanted to be with him.

“No one. No one talked to me like that before.”

It was instantly that the Wizard gave up his old ways, looking forward to being more open-minded and having Bob as someone to look up to as a person.
