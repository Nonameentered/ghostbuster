“Alright. How much is a gold bar cost nowadays?”

“Not sure. Can we even afford one?”

“Oh. I dunno, but I just remembered we have smartphones again.”

“Thank god. Dunno what I was doing all that time back then in the previous world without this.”

The two guys are pulling up articles on their phones. Then their faces drop to a frown.

“$1800?!”

“That’s like nine car payments for me.”

“We should have finished this quest before leaving.” A goblin enters after going to the bathroom. Toilet paper stuck to his feet, trailing along as he walked like the cartoon character he was.

“Ah, gross, man. Clean up after yourself.”

“I’m not used to your world.” The goblin said.

“Did you flush?”

“Flush?”

“Aw, man.”

“Okay. I get paid this Friday, I’ll take the hit, and you can pay me back later. We have to worry about taking care of him.”

“No way. I’m not rooming with him. I got an idea.”

They got the car keys and started onto the road. It took the group a moment to recall how to drive again. It was long ago, and one of the guys had difficulty pressing the gas pedal at the proper pressure. “Careful man!” One of them said,

“It’s not like riding horses, man.”

“Hey, do you got maps?”

“Yeah.”

“Take me to the new’s station.”

After a couple of miles, they arrive at their local station. The receptionist writes their names down and tells them to take a seat. The goblin’s in the car with the AC on high. He isn’t restless, however, as he’s playing with the switches and buttons. Meanwhile, the group is talking with a journalist. “It’s better outside if you come with us and see.”

“Why is that?” Asked the journalist.

“It’s difficult to explain.” They leave the office and arrive at their car. Everyone is panicking because the car doors are wide open, the seats torn to a million pieces, and there’s no sign of the goblin. The confused journalist says,

“Well, I guess you lost it.”
