The door to the third trial was open, and Bob walked through the door. The Elixirium was posted on top of a pedestal. The glow was a light blue aura, and as Bob wrapped his hands around it, he felt a warmth that coaxed more tears out of him. Bob didn't know the Necromancer for long, but his memories went along with the powers.

Bob couldn't ruminate on the memories for long. Otherwise, the mere thought of it was enough to bring back the Necromancer's pain and his pain. Bob felt what was left of a soul from the previous owner, and he wouldn't allow his death to be in vain. The Necromancer noticed Bob and tried to understand him, despite his differences.

"I want to clear this up now. Even though now you're the new Necromancer, I feel more comfortable calling you Bob." The Cleric said.

"I was about to say that." The Fighter said.

"That's the least of our problems," Bob said.

"What do you mean?"

"I'm a Necromancer. Isn't that illegal?"

"We'll figure that out later. The first priority is to the kingdom." The Wizard said.

"Right," Bob said. "Let's head back and make a plan."

"I do not. The group formed outside of my control."

"The presence of a Necromancer disappeared and reappeared."

"I'll investigate"
