Hello! I found your prompt to be enjoyable and it sparked something for me. I wanted to try something new with this prompt, I wrote it as a screenplay but due to unfamiliarity with how reddit formats their posts, I am unsure how it will turn out. Thank you for reading!

SOLDIER: My liege. We are under attack.

RICH KING: From what? There is nothing out here.

SOLDIER:I can’t tell you.

RICH KING:Why not?

On the monitor is Planet Earth, and it’s heading towards the Galactic Federation at a steady pace.

RICH KING:I want everything against that ship. Now!

SOLDIER:Fire everything!

But planet Earth isn’t budging. An enormous shield is covering the planet, deflecting projectiles back at the ship. One projectile lands at the underside of the ship, making a crunch capable of dropping the King’s stomach and his ship. 

RICH KING:Start communications with them.

The monitor clicks on to reveal the face of a war torn rebel wearing a smirk. 

REBEL:Now you want to talk.

RICH KING:Please, I’ll do anything. Money, soldiers, or even women, I’ll give you anything. Your ship is stronger than ours. You win.

REBEL:My ship?

RICH KING:Yes? This is your vessel?

REBEL:You don’t even recognize your home planet? The same planet that you Galactic Federation peeps left long ago?

RICH KING:I went to get wealth! You have to understand, I was doing this to save you all.

REBEL:Planet Earth doesn’t need saving. It was saved back when you guys left the system. Turns out, when all of you greedy assholes left, the factories stopped polluting the atmosphere. People didn’t want money. They wanted to survive and it’s easy to survive too. We don’t work for money. We’re bigger than that. 
RICH KING:You need money! It motivates you. It motivates me!
REBEL:That’s not what motivates me. You know what motivates me? This planet. This planet leeched off the sun for many years, even before we were born. You know what we did? We leeched off of you, just like the Earth with the Sun. We looked to you for jobs. While we were going through your rigorous resume algorithms, Planet Earth was rotting, it’s parks are empty  except with the litter strewn about. The air was clouded with your smoke. Then when we needed your guidance the most, you left. The sun left with dignity, it had a long life of work under it’s belt. It didn’t abandon us, it died out. 

There’s a brief pause to let the points sink in. Then the Rebel continues.

REBEL:Now the tables have turned. You’re about to crash land on an abandoned planet. You finally will get to see what it’s like to work for your own survival. It’s not hard. You don’t need the constant write ups, the hour long zoom meetings, or even the concept of minimum wage. All you need is the pride of finishing a long day of work and what you have achieved from it. Sayonara!
