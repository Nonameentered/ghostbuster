"Now that makes me suspicious of you."

"Trust me."

"Plenty of bad guys always try to trick you by saying, trust me."

"If you don't do it, bad things will happen!"

"What 'bad' things? Look, I need you to be more specific here."

"There's no time to explain!"

"You're just trying to rush me to make an impulsive decision. You're not selling yourself here by being cliche."

"Look, I know I just met you and you don-"

"I said quit being cliche! The whole 'Look! I just met you and blah, blah' crap is pointless unless you're singing the Carly Rae song. I've asked you to be more specific and so far I have only recieved vague answers."

"But you won't believe me!"

"As it stands now, we are not going to make any progress with you being shifty about this. Out with it or I'll shoot you!"
