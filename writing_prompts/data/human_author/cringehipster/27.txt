“I’m not demeaning your work, but you’re doing a horrid job at maintaining the infrastructure. And I’ve met plenty of groomed trolls who don’t smell like you.”

“How dare you. I put lots of sweat into this bridge.”

“I sweat too, but the difference here is that I take a bath once in while. I admire your passion, but we need to change it up a little.”

“What do you mean?”

“No more tolls. We’ll pay you on behalf of the kingdom.”

“But I like the Troll Toll rhyme.”

“I like it too, but we have to think about the big picture. The more we don’t charge for roads, the better. A citizen should be able to travel the roads to spend money at local businesses.”

“That makes sense.”

“It’s nothing against you or how you run things. I find myself admiring your work, just not your stench.”

“I’ll take a bath.”

“You’ll find that you’ll attract more females with that attitude.”
