Before Bob could say anymore, the Necromancer used a spell to summon the bullets back into the hands of their original owner, Bob. This action confused Bob, and at that instant, Bob blacked out, leaving him in a dreamlike state.

Bob was back to when he decided to go at it alone in the dungeons. The monsters cornered him in a room; Bob used a dagger to fight back, nearly bleeding to death, exhausted, and suddenly collapsed on the dungeon floor. So this is it, he thought. This was how he wanted to go, and he didn’t want to live in a world where people abandoned him at any moment. He stared at the ceiling, cursing this world for cheating him. Bob didn’t realize until now that he had died that day. 

And he was then resurrected by the Necromancer, the random stranger who rescued him long ago. Bob watched as his body was brought back to life by the same foe he was fighting. The previous dream version of Bob crawled around, looking for who saved him before giving up the search, opening the chest that gave him the sniper rifle that helped him get this far. Finally, the dream Bob left the dungeon, leaving the current Bob to meditate on what happened. Then a dream version of the Necromancer entered the room with Bob. 

“Now you understand who saved you.”

“Why?”

“Because, like you, I was abandoned by my previous party members. I saw myself in you, filled with hatred for others, wanting to escape from people. I went through the same situation as you. Only you chose to end up teaming with others, planning to kill them in the end. I became a Necromancer and forfeited humanity.”

“How did you know I was going to kill them?”

“I’ve had control over you ever since you died here. My interest was piqued when I discovered your plan.” The Necromancer lifts his arms, showing him the room. “This is your birthplace. You thought the sniper rifle made you special, but it was me. I raised you from the dead. The gun was a bonus. An unpredictable outcome I didn’t foresee.”

“Why me?”

“I’ve lived for a thousand years in solitude, and I cannot live a thousand more. I’m dying. I wanted to give someone else the gift of living alone.”

“Living alone?”

“Exactly. You don’t need the gold to live alone, you need my powers, and with that, I can guarantee a longer life without others. At least a thousand years. Think of all you can do during that time, amass an army, discover new hobbies, or discover how to live longer.” The Necromancer noticed that this caught Bob’s attention. “Look at it this way; your current party relies on you because you have a sniper rifle. What if you lost it? The first person to leave you would be the Cleric, as she would find some other adventurer to latch on to, with the Fighter following along. You can only hope the Wizard stays, but do you trust your new friends?”
