I'm on the outskirts of the second town. In fear of being recognized, I killed some bandits for their armor as I needed a hood to mask my face for stealing. If caught, I would have to return Excalibur to Barley. That's not going to happen. I stared at that blade throughout lunchtime during high school. Thankfully, a credit card was not within my reach at the time. Nevertheless, I knew I would obtain that blade, which was a matter of time.

I reached the tavern to meet another goofy bartender in typical adventurer's fashion. There was a cheap gimmick naming all the bartenders after a plant known for making alcohol. The second town's name is Potato, and it struck me that the town was a snowy village, making this the ClickQuest equivalent to Russia.

Hastily, I reach the quest board to look for opportunities to level up. While the strongest sword in the game was on my side, I needed to gather experience to equip it. The amount of levels I need is 5. So, I popped up that menu I used earlier to attempt my purchase of Diamonds. I click the arrows on the top and glance at my stats.
