Bob's new adventuring party consisted of three different party members with radical abilities. Bob's old party wasn't as strong as these heroes, and it's thanks to Bob's new item. Each party member has a goal they want to achieve. For example, the Fighter joined Bob's new party because he fancies the Cleric. Bob needed the warrior, so he led with this selling point, manipulating the Fighter into joining.

Meanwhile, the Cleric joined the party due to a selfish desire to help others for fame. A cleric who could heal any wound was better than the average cleric. Bob didn't want to be left for dead in a dungeon, even if he had to have a doctor with a god complex. His exaggerated stories of fame and glory were able to capture the attention of the expert cleric.

The final member of Bob's new team was the Wizard, a snob with a hunger for knowledge. The Wizard was the annoying one of the party. He feels he's got to know about everything, even declaring himself as the leader even though Bob was bankrolling the mission with his life savings. The only reason why the Wizard joined was that no other party was willing to take him.

This leaves Bob, the glorified archer of the group. Why would Bob take in a whipped fighter, a narcissistic cleric, and a hipster wizard? Because his previous party was no better. Bob's motivation for trudging through dungeons was for money. Bob wanted to retire peacefully as a recluse and leave his new party members out for dead, just like his previous group did. So, then he picked the most despicable group of adventurers he could find, but he couldn't do so without his legendary weapon.

His sniper rifle was his ticket back to a rags-to-riches type of story. When he was last left off for dead, he had nothing again. Having to start at square one, he climbed through multiple dungeons, vowing for revenge and settling for retirement afterward. After making a promise to himself to escape from society as a hermit, the sniper rifle appeared to help him in his endeavor.

It took the misanthrope a moment to understand the weapon. Once he got the hang of it, many monsters whispered the rumors of a man capable of vanishing heads with the click of a lever. The dwarven engineers even hired assassins to take out Bob. A story that ended with Bob's life saved by a random stranger. Bob still couldn't comprehend why the stranger saved his life, but it taught him something that day. He needed people to watch his back again, but he needed to be in control.
