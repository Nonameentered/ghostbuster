“Therefore, I bless thee thy Paladin,” God said to me. I looked at my hands. Divine energy is coursing through me. I felt power capable of destroying civilizations. Then God started again, “Go forth, stop the heretics from spreading false beliefs.” With that, he’s gone, and I know my mission.

The first step was to secure a job as an Adventurer. The nearest town’s guild measured my potential, the secretary eyes my stats, and she said, “Ah. Well, you’re a level 1 warrior.” That’s odd; I expected to be a different class from the others. Then God’s voice returned,

“Let none find out thy secret, or I shall smite thee.”

I did tell God that I wanted to be a superhero. He took it literally, even having to carry a secret identity. I ask the secretary if there are any quests, and she points toward the board. On the board is a few quests. I didn’t want to take anything that would draw suspicion, but as always, God had other plans.

“There. That one.”

“The quest about helping the church find thieves?”

“Of course.” It’s an excellent quest, even for a level one. When I arrived at the church, I discovered who those heretics were. The priest eyes me and asks me,

“Are you the Adventurer who accepted the quest?”

“Yes. Tell me everything.” He went on about how the thieves ran away to a local hiding place. Then, they stole the tithes from the church. “They went this direction when I saw them.”

“Alright, thank you.” The journey wasn’t bad. I made it next to the cave and set up camp. I’m waiting till nightfall. After cooking a meal and getting a number for how many guys I have to knock out, evening came. I unsheathed my sword and pointed it to the sky, “Ariel!”

I’m like Shazam, a superhero with the backing of a god. Even the lightning shot across my body. I felt the power inside me, and the voices of the thieves were wondering what was going on. Five of the thieves tried to gang up on me. A fool’s choice, the sword slashed through them with no resistance.

They laid on the ground after my strike. Numbers popped out of their dead bodies, and it was experience points! God must have known that I was a nerd. What fun, I decided to go inside the cave to grind more experience. When I was done, the tithes were in my hand. I’m ready to head back.

When I arrived back, the priest thanked me for my hard work and gave me my share. The priest said something along the lines of, “Thank Menod.” Before I could consider what he said, I blacked out.

Waking up, I was on the cold tile of the church floor. Next to me is a pile of dead bodies. It’s the churchpeople! I ran out as fast as I could before God’s voice came back.

“Remember, no one can know of this.”
