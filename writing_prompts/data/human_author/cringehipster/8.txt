"It's what makes me comfortable," Bob replied.

"Even in the threat of death, you still go at it alone."

"You were right. They ended up leaving."

"The old me would've laughed in your face. But, I've come to more of an understanding after you left."

"I take it that you didn't die."

"Physically, no. I took time to consider our meeting back then. After being defeated by your friends, I'm reminded of the time I saved you."

"Didn't you save me so you could take over my body?"

"Didn't you try to kill your friends so you could take the reward money?"

"You have a point."

"When you went at it alone, that resonated with me. I went at it alone, like you. I did better than you. I didn't die my first time."

"Hey! I was angry, and I didn't waste time learning necromancy."

"But, I became lonely. Lonely enough to wash away the sorrow of not being able to appreciate friendships. When your group stopped me, I nearly died. That's the power of companions. 
"How did you end up here?"

"Looking for Elixirium to extend my life."

"Did you find it?"

"Yes."

"Where?"

"Come with me."

Bob and the Necromancer walked further into the cavern until they arrived at a towering stone door that read,

**Trial of Friendship One.**

**To enter, Everyone must have TRUST.** 

"Why would they lock Elixirium behind a trial?" Bob asked.

"It's a rare resource coveted by ancient Elves. So they had to save some for when they needed it."

"It says here that we need Trust."

"I know. A hard thing for us to have in each other."

"Right. The guy who betrayed me is now asking for my Trust."

"That's why I need to tell you something." The Necromancer walked up to Bob, staring through his eyes.

"This will end in one of three ways. The first way is that I let you become a Necromancer. I give you my powers, and you take on the Adventurer's Guild after you defeat the Necromancer. It's the easiest way that you can go at it alone. The second option is we leave without the Elixirium and take on the Necromancer ourselves. We can do that. The final option is we go through these trials to obtain the Elixirium and make the sniper rifle. Hopefully, there's enough Elixirium for me to live longer."

"Realistically, I would choose the second option because I have trust issues, but I am interested to hear why you want the third."

"The third will keep me alive, gain your trust, and gives us the strongest weapon to fight the Necromancer."

"But I'd have to trust you."

"Exactly. This is why I'm giving you these three options. I know what it's like for you. I want to change that. I won't stand for another loner in this world. I only ask you to remember what it was like to lose your friends."

Bob sat there for a second, replaying all the memories. Then he shook his head and said,

"I'm sorry. I'll have to go with the second option. We don't need the rifle."

"I understand. Well "

Then the stone door swung open, revealing a hallway for the two walkthrough.

"Alright. Let's go."

"Why did the door open?"

"The trial said to have everyone with Trust. Didn't say how much or if we had to keep it."
