Years passed, and she left on the train to do her own thing. My life lost its purpose on that day. I feel disconnected from everything. I wake up, and then I go to bed. I don't remember what happened in between. Brief moments of lucidity might happen, and I think, "Oh, I'm at work," or "Ah, I'm driving." But not a day goes by that I don't think, "what happened to Lucy?"

Then I found out. It started with hints of bad writing around me. The people I talked to were puppets. My friend, John, for instance, has a boring name. I've tried to elicit opinions from the man, and his responses are repetitive. At first, I thought John was dense and lacked a personality, but then I called one of Lucy's friends. She was a similar case. It was a puzzle that I had to ignore for now.

I arrived at the train station, where I said goodbye to Lucy. I used to visit once a month, waiting for her to come back magically. Now, it's every other day. I cannot move on. I called crying many times, but I couldn't reach her. I was alone, and my solace was walking around here, replaying the same memories over and over like a broken DVD. Somedays, I wake up, and the depression evolves into anger. Why did she leave? It was a stupid reason. We were happy together.

She told me that she felt as if her calling was somewhere else. If you told me this, I would think some terrible god is at play. Only this God is a writer, and I'm sure he's letting his pain seep into my life. He's no god; he's a devil, and I'm not letting his misery rule my life. So I hop onto the first train to Morrowville, the first step into quitting my job, my life, my apathetic friends, and finding the love of my life. Screw you, God. I'm getting her back, and it's time for you to listen to me now.
