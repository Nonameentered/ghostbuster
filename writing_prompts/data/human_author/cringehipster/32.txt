“OH HELL NO YOU DONT!” Michael said before aiming a missile towards the sky.

“What is that thing going to do to us?” The voice in the sky booms.

“Hello? I am the only person on the planet, I am armed with nuclear weapons!”

“But we have more guys?”

“So?”

“We’re capable of sniping you with the millions of guns on our vessel, sir.”

 “I already thought of that.”

“How would you be able to deflect a laser?”

“Why would I tell you that?”

“Alright, commence firing in 3, 2,-” but before the invaders could fire, Micheal lets off the missile. It careens into the sky, before a small thud is heard and Michael leaps into house wearing an ‘oopsie’ type of expression. A laser sprints through the house, burning a hole through the roof.

“Target eliminated. Securing position.”

The aliens land next to the house, excited to see the remnants of the last survivor’s lifestyle. They look at the house and notice that there’s a huge metal freezer inside. The raider’s couldn’t react in time as Michael kicks open the freezer door, unloading all of his weapons onto his assailants. 

After finishing them all, Michael goes to a wounded soldier and asks him, “So, you gonna teach me on how to pilot this thing?”

“The council will find you.” Michael stepped on his wound and he yelled, “Arrrgghh.”

“That wasn’t what I asked.”

“Okay, Okay.”

“Yeah, this planet will do…”
