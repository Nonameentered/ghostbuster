I imagine scenes, stories, and characters whenever I listen to music. I am a storyteller at heart, even if I don't pick up the pen. I'm not a writer unless you count screenwriting as such. It's tedious to paint the setting for every moment of your story. I love to write scripts because the story's fast-paced when in script form, you can say, "Setting: Big City that's crowded with people". My only issue with scripts is that I cannot hire actors; they're expensive.

When programs like Mid journey and text to speech, I can become the writer, the director, and the star. I dreamed of this, and now it's happening. My latest movie has netted me ten billion dollars. I have enough money to live on, but I am still depressed. I found myself wracked with nostalgia for the gold old days.

It was fun to make a movie with people, not with AI. But, there's a feeling you can't shake, one where you long to cooperate with others. It's a curse from the old days when we banded together as a tribe. Since I am not financially independent, I want to make a return to the traditional way of making movies. I won't be purchasing cameras or set equipment. Instead, I will rely on a voice acting studioâ€”a sweet mixture of the classic and new.
