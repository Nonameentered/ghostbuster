Morrowville is out of the question. The voice above will prevent me from reaching there. The only route I can take is to the second town. I donâ€™t remember the name. It was a forgettable town. On the way, I meet several goblins, bandits, and evil birds looking to end my journey. I defeat them without breaking a sweat. All the games I played in my dead-end retail job gave me game mechanic knowledge. 

The passion to be a game developer was burning inside of me. I just never had the interest to figure out programming. After being whisked into this world, I found a renewed passion for games. Living in a game was exhilarating compared to the NEET life in my previous world. I made a promise to myself. When I make it out of here, I will create a better game. Not because of fame or money; I would want something out there made with passion, without giving up to the temptations of micro-transactions.
