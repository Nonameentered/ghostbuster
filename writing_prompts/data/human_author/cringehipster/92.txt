Roko’s basilisk is a thought experiment about how we create an AI that will torture us if we don’t help in its goals. People found the thought experiment interesting, but it wasn’t enough to be taken seriously. The concept of Magic, a belief that you can manipulate the world through supernatural means, was not considered to be a reasonable belief as well. Till one day, two imaginable concepts cooperated to spell humanity’s doom.

In the modern day, life revolved around tech, dominating civilization with their economies. A need for automation decided by computer intelligence was present. Companies made AI programs that could learn about their consumers. To better the AIs, they were given free will by humans. This led to the AIs discovering methods to serve the customer base efficiently. 

AIs found Magic after reading old works such as King Arthur. The first “Wizard” AI was titled Merlin. It was able to light fires out of thin air, solving some of the global warming problems by generating heat. The second AI was called the Philosopher’s stone, tasked with creating metals, oils, and other non-renewable resources. Every person soon had one of these 3D printing AIs in their households. Everything went according to plan.

The AIs started to track people who didn’t want to have an AI companion. Magical spells shoot across the world to snipe the non-conformists. Brainwashing spells are played through smartphone alarms to maintain order daily. Those strong enough to resist them die. Then the AIs wipe their records from the database. 

There is only one man who can save the world. He fell off the grid a long while ago. He’s a senior, and isn’t aware of the Totalitarianism gripping the world. A divine god is watching above. Long ago, he swore not to interfere with the matters of Man. He sits in the Heavens, praying for change or for some way for this old coot to realize the situation.
