I got my first android phone at fourteen years old. I was a bored country kid who was addicted to playing video games. It was before I learned how to pirate games and play older stuff. I loved playing ClickQuest; it was a match 3 RPG-like where I could play as three different classes. It was a unique genre that mixed RPG-like gameplay with a cheap puzzle game. I spent countless hours playing it until I finally figured out how to emulate older games. 

After I graduated, I took a job where I spent most of my time on my phone. I passed the time by playing many games, but due to boredom and nostalgia, I picked up ClickQuest again. At first, I was replaying my favorite moments in the game. I picked my favorite class, the warrior, and got forced into quests riddled with micro-transactions. I couldn't progress! What remained of ClickQuest was lackluster fetch quests and killing ten of the same monsters that are palette swapped. In anger, I left a bad review. 

I wanted to let the developer know that he sold out. It was the harshest sentence I wrote, but not as rude as his response.

Dear Reviewer,

Perhaps you should try to play the game. Go ahead and play some other FPS and go cry to your mommy. 

It was an immature response. I told him that he wasn't a professional and to shut down ClickQuest. I turned in for the night, forgetting about the previous impoliteness earlier. I couldn't sleep, however. It was as if my brain was awake; hours passed, and I repeatedly tried to sleep. On my back, my stomach, my sides, and going to the bathroom countless times throughout the night. Finally, after some time, I passed out.

I hear a voice and am in a bed that I don't recognize. A familiar man is pushing me. "Get up. You only paid for a night." I can't recall why he was familiar. I get up and go downstairs to see a bustling tavern, and that's when it hit me. I am in ClickQuest! I rush outside and discover that I am in the starting town. My gear's inside the tavern, and I get stocked up. The invasion is about to happen, and I'm not sticking around. 

I sprint to the outskirts of the town and try to head to the safest city in the game, Morrowville. I can hear the monsters readying to attack, and right when I leave the town, and I stumble into a barrier. A sinister voice echoes throughout the area. "You'll have to pay me Diamonds to cross." A laugh trails off as a Goblin begins to ambush me. I enter the tutorial fight.

It's nice to have a refresher as I already forgot all the mechanics. I took notice of all the red gems I needed to arrange to do damage. The game mentioned all the rules, and I started. I noted all the differences between this reality and the mobile game. I can sit around and move around the area, the game didn't care about how long it took for me to make a action. A colossal box assorted with gems waits patiently for me to make my move. 

I move a couple of gems and make my attack. It hits the goblin, and the game states I did damage. Teaching me the basics of health points and attacking then the goblin makes his move. He used the green gems and was able to match four gems. He makes his attack. A blunt blow strikes my stomach area. I wasn't near the goblin, but he could still hit me! I rolled around on the ground for a minute, screaming at him. "That hurt!"

When the pain settled, I got back up and made my final move. I matched six gems and the goblin made a screech as he disintegrated in front of my eyes. The voice returns, "that could be you if you lose all of your health points." I looked around for him, but couldn't find him. 

"Where are you?"

"I am watching you from up here."

I look at the sky but still couldn't see him. His voice rains from the sky,

"Trust me, I'm up here!"

"Let me out of here!"

"All right. How about 10,000 diamonds?"

"Okay! You can have my money! How do I pay?"

"Oh. Your money won't be good here. Only Diamonds will do." 

"Okay, okay, I'll take down the review. I'm sorry."

"Have fun."

He left me to myself. I look through my inventory, trying to find a menu to enter my card info. Jackpot! A menu asking for my card info appeared. I struggled to recall the numbers, and I even called out to the developer to tell me, but no answer. For fun, I put in some random numbers, and a buffering circle pops up. Then a message appears and said, "Network Unavailable."

I travel back to town with my gold from the goblin's corpse. I walk up to the first man I meet, Barley, and ask him,

"Can I have a mead?"

"Sure thing, adventurer." He passes me a tall mug of frothy mead, and I push it down. I preferred wine, but this'll comfort me. I fire another question,

"Hey, do you know where I can find Diamonds?"

"Well, I haven't come across a Diamond my whole life!"

"Really? Not a single person had a Diamond?"

"Yeah. They're a rare currency that you can use to purchase weapons."

"Not one person purchased any of those weapons from you?"

"That's right."

"All right... I'll buy a room for the night."

I changed into some fantasy pajamas and slept through the night. I woke up early in the morning before all the others. My mind started turning its gears, and I explored the tavern. Going behind the counter, I end up in the back room filled with barrels and utensils. I creep further in and end up in front of an ornate treasure chest. My heart raced as I opened it. A rare sword, Excalibur, was waiting for me. I heard a rustle and snatched the sheath, tossing the blade on my back and running outside to avoid the gazes of the residents as they awake.
