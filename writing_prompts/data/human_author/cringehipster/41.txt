And where’s God in all of this? Distracted with life on Earth. Both Heaven and Hell are terrible places to be, with neither side having a positive except “Well, we’re not the bad guys here.” So, what to do? Create a group of freethinkers who want to make their own league.

A growing group of freedom fighters are mobilizing in Hell, as it’s the easiest place to recruit people. Eventually a whole army was amassed to take over hell, overthrowing Satan and all of the old pagan gods. Even some of the Gods and Goddesses joined the humans. One god, Dionysus admired the tenacity of humans. Hatching a plan to weaken the zealots of Heaven.

Wine, which is a typical God’s favorite beverage, was the passion of Dionysus. Dionysus offered the beverage of wine to the zealots of Heaven, tricking them by saying it’s the blood of Christ. The zealots passed out, letting the humans steal the Empyrean throne of God. Kicking all the Angels, zealots, and demons out to hell. Heaven is now under the control of the second being created. That’s when God noticed, sending Jesus Christ to stop all of this.
