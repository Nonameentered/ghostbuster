Two friends are discussing the upcoming election in a bar.

“Alright, tell me your theory.”

“So, the reason why a politician has to eat an entire head of lettuce is because it show’s willpower.”

“What are you talking about?”

“You can’t even go a day without eating salad right?”

“Yeah, salad is gross.”

“Well, imagine eating a whole salad that’s unwashed, uncut, and contains all the dirty bits too.”

“Even the bottom?”

“Yup. The bottom’s the worst part. If I see a candidate eat the bottom without cringing, he’s got my vote.”

A stranger chimes in.

“Nah. That’s not why they do it.”

“Oh really? What’s your guess then?”

The stranger looks side to side before beginning,

“Word says, they’re turning into rabbits.”

“Excuse me?”

“Rabbits, all of them.”

“Ah. I think you meant lizard men?”

“They got it wrong. It’s not lizard men, it’s rabbits.”

“Alrighty. So, let’s say it’s rabbits, what are they planning?”

“What do you mean?”

“Every conspiracy theory has-”

“It’s not a conspiracy theory, it’s factual.”

“Ignoring the fact that there is not any evidence, why rabbits?”

“I don’t know man.”

“I mean, there has to be an agenda. Right?”

“Look around man, everywhere.”

“Hahaha. Okay. Anyways, we’re out of here. Take care. Make sure to carry a bunch of rat food around too.” Everyone leaves. The bartender closes shop and then grabs his cellphone, making a call.

“I got a code white here. Someone knows.”
