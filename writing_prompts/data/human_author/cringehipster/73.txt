I was about to teleport again until the aliens showed up. They were grey humanoids, like the movies you see. I guess I can tell Nic that they are not green. For a moment, I thought about having a friendly chat with them. It's a once-in-a-lifetime chance to meet aliens! I could learn from them, but then I realized they wanted to probe me more than I wanted to know about them. So I think back to my house and teleport!

It didn't work? Maybe I was stressed? Teleport! I thought loudly to myself as the aliens started to gang up on me. Oh no. They found out how to block my abilities!

"Hey! Haha, uh, is there something that I can help with?" They didn't respond, and they were inching nearer. On instinct, I kicked the medical table I was on. The table shot at one of the knees of the grey captors. I felt his pain a little. I never liked punching people, and this was similar to me. I had to dash my feelings aside; they recoiled back after I kicked the table at them! One of the aliens was holding the needle by his head. I took my chance.

Grabbing his arm, I position the needle to stab the alien in his neck. He flopped into my arms, and he was surprisingly light to hold. The other aliens were gaining on me in the room. I run behind the table again, holding the alien as I go. The other aliens expected me to kick the table again, so I acted as if I had kicked it. A clever prank that I was oddly proud of myself for. I reached the door and slapped the alien hand on the lock. It opened!

You can see me running across the hallway, alien over my shoulder and clueless. I didn't think this far. I tried to teleport again, but no luck. This whole ship must have been blocked from my powers. The only thing to do is go left! I always go left in mazes, and it's the best chance I have. I made it into a control room with a bunch of monitors. On all of the monitors is footage of me using my abilities. The Aliens are trying to figure out how to get my abilities.

I would have helped them if they asked; however, I can see why they wouldn't want my help. They're planning world domination on other worlds, including my own. When I got my powers, I wanted to use them for good, and now this is my chance. Oddly enough, I am going to stop them without the use of my superpowers. 

I quickly pour over any info that the control room might have on me. I hear noises outside, which makes me panic. Without thinking, I grab a manual and sprint away. I need to find the piloting part of the ship. When I felt safe after evading, I looked at the manual I had grabbed. It was a manual on probing, which wasn't what I needed. I was furious, tossing the manual on the floor. Then, thinking back on all the sci-if stuff I watched as a kid, I remember that the controls tend to be at the front of the ship.

I stood still, trying to feel the direction the ship was going. It was going forward in the south direction. That's as good as a shot as any to run in. I made it, the controls were gibberish, but I could see a joystick to control the ship. Without hesitation, I yank the stick towards the first solid object I can see. This happened to be an asteroid. You can hear the sirens going off all over the ship. Earlier I blocked the door with a bunch of chairs. The aliens were not getting in. 

Then I heard awful scratching noises on the ship's hull, then CRASH. A voice played over the intercom, and I could tell everyone was panicking. What a way to go out, or so I thought because I panicked and teleported back to the safety of my bathroom. God, it's nice to be back in this dirty restroom. The smell's terrible, though. Well, now that's done and over with.

Or so I thought because a week later, a dozen ships, like the one I crashed earlier, were invading us from the sky. But unfortunately, I cannot teleport to any of them either.
