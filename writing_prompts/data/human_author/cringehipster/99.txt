I met the eccentric a month ago. He didn’t strike me as exceptional, but the ladies loved him. I had the “opportunity” to be dragged alongside him as he “solved” five cases. Each case was obvious, even a rookie cop could follow along, but our lovable doofus detective, “Herlock,” still gained a mass following. 

Flashback to the first case. Herlock was looking for a rug, and I needed a roommate. After looking around for a little, I met the pot-headed sleuth. He was mixing a drink as I walked into his apartment. I look around his room, where a brown table is littered with bud, empty chip bags, and granola bars wrappers. Herlock looks at me and waves, “White Russian?”

“No, thank you.”

“Who are you, by the way?”

“I called earlier.”

“Oh yeah. About the case!”

“No. The opening for a roommate.”

Our gumshoe Lebowski drags me along his little private detective mission. I am in his beat-up car, with soft, sweltering carpeted seats. The seat I am in has a stain on it, and I am trying to position my ass to not sit on it. I recently bought my jeans, and I am not looking to buy another pair. Finally, the detective decides to start the conversation. I give up and plop onto the stain. 

“Names Herlock,” he says to me. I try to figure out if that’s even a real name, and I ask him to repeat it. 

“Herlock.”

“Did your mom name you that?”

“Of course!” I didn’t believe him, but I continued.

“So where are we going?”

“We’re going to see Agnes. She’s a lovely lady. Bakes us cookies and always gives me money when the business isn’t doing well.” I took note of what he said. As soon as I make it out of this awkwardness, the quicker I will enroll in a homeless shelter. We arrive at Agnes’s house. A bum sits on her stairs as Herlock stumbles out of his vehicle. Herlock puts on a pair of sunglasses and shakes the bum’s hand.

“Jimmy! How are you.”

“Good.” Herlock pulls out a joint and lights it, sitting beside Jimmy. He takes a puff and passes it to Jimmy, who snatches it with no hope of returning it. Jimmy opens up to us.

“Agnes lost her cat.”

“I see.”

The next few moments are the shadiest bits to happen. Herlock forks out some cash, hands it to the bum, and tells him to see if there are any orange cats in the animal shelter. Jimmy leaps from the stairs and hops on a bicycle, pedaling faster than a hamster on a wheel. Herlock looks at me and says, “come on.” I wanted to turn away as quickly as possible, but something in me said I had to see this case through, at least. 

We walk into Agnes’s disintegrating house as he exclaims, “AGGIE.” It was loud enough to rattle the place around us. This old lady stumbles around the side of the house, nearly having to call life alert along the way. Herlock rushes to her side and helps her to a chair.
