If you'd looked out there, you'd think it's night time. I tried going back to bed, but I couldn't shake off the weirdness of it all. I didn't feel like I was dreaming, I'm awake. I know that.

Due to damage control, I try to see how far I can go into the void without falling. Part of my sidewalk is glued to my house. It's surreal. My house avoiding the laws of physics. All around me is pitch dark. The world is darker than Vanta Black paint. 

I spent the day looking for my space telescope. I wanted to see if there was anything near me. The telescope was a gift from my family. It didn't prove itself useful until now. Then, finally, I found it.

I set the telescope outside and grabbed snacks. That's when I remembered what kind of trouble I stumbled into. I had a weeks worth of groceries to use up before I either starve or fall into the void.

Thankfully, I don't eat when I'm stressed. Unfortunately, I'm stressed. I thought a nap would relax me, but it got me into further trouble. Though, I shouldn't get angry at myself. There's nothing I could have done to prevent this. It's out of my control.

I have to focus on what I can do. That starts with looking through the telescope. Hours had gone by. Not a single spot of the void was exempt from examination. Even I had to look down with the telescope, holding it as if I was a pirate. I can see a small light.

It's downwards from the house, which is a relief. I can imagine my way out being in front of me would be an issue. This little light at the bottom, I can get down there.

I grabbed every towel, bedsheet, and pillow cases to make into a rope. There's a fire hydrant next to my sidewalk to attach my work. I test my makeshit rope by tugging on it, it seemed secure. Not comfortably secure, but I'm hedging my bets on a little light in the void. I'm already unhinged enough.

I'm near the bottom of the rope, losing room on the rope to hold. I feel a tiny sensation of tearing from the rope. The light's beneath my feet. It's round, bright, and I can feel a warm aura from it. I know this is the key to my escape.

So, I slide down to the end of the rope, almost losing my grip. My other hand is reaching for the orb, and then I hear a loud honk. To my side is a red car driving towards me. It crawls next to me, and a hand snatches my shirt collar and I'm dragged along the car, the light going further away from my sight.
