I've lined up all the people who came in five minutes before closing. I personally reserved a special place in hell for them for taking my time. One of them said to me, "I didn't mean to come in. It was super important!" 

"Nothing that you need is that important enough for you to take me away from my time and family/friends," I said to her.

"I didn't know you were closed."

"If you opened your eyes, you would have noticed our open sign is off."

"You guys close at 7."

"That's correct. I still have to count the register, sweep, put up inventory, and deal with your inconsiderate ass." I would come back to them later. It's time I deal with the real degenerates that pissed me off over the last two years. I went into the back room, and about 20 or so people were muzzled and glaring at me. I pulled out my piece of paper and prepared for my monologue.

"I enjoy seeing each one of you muzzled. It's god damn beautiful. After two years of having to listen to your tinfoil conspiracies and your temper tantrums, finally, I have peace. Yeah, the mask mandate is down. Congratulations! It's no thanks to you! Millions died of a virus that you exposed others to. All because you couldn't stay home or wear a piece of cloth on your face!"

"So, of course, my workplace had to set policies. My workplace didn't pay me a dime extra either, so with your mewling about how this is unjust or unfair, or it's trampling my free speech! Fuck you." I said, taking extra care with my impressions to sound as whiney and annoying as possible. I couldn't do my impression justice. 

"You all made my life a living hell. Kicking you fuckers out while you yelled at me, spat on me, potentially exposing my immune-compromised family members, you all are heartless. I even attempted to step in your shoes, and I tried to see from your side. I could see where you all were coming from. I could play Devil's advocate for you all but guess what. I spent a whole year doing curbside and only entered a store wearing a mask. It wasn't hard, and I didn't want to wear it. No one died. I only hated wearing it when I was forced to, thanks to you fucks extending the pain. I'm not going to be responsible for giving someone Covid."

"Next year, I will muzzle you all again. I remember each one of your names. Including you, Pamela. Especially you. I make sure to give you the worst customer service I can give you because I remember when you walked in my store testing positive."
