I wish I was the only cheater out here. I knew that karma would come back-

"Hey! Quit thinking and play."

Come on, man! This is an invasion of privacy.

"Well, how will you beat me at the competition tomorrow?"

I don't know. Quit asking. It's hard to have a conversation with my thoughts. If you didn't have a conversation with a mind reader, then you got to know that it's weird to have him interrupt your train of-

"Are you monologuing to an invisible audience right now?"

Yeah?

"That's depressing. Welp, that was your last chance to figure out how to beat me. See you tomorrow."

He left. It makes me wonder if he can read my thoughts right now. On the other hand, it may be an area of ability effect, and he might have to be near me. I'm finally playing a version of chess for the first time in my life, and it's making me nostalgic for the good old days before I started cheating at games.

It's 2016, and I was a professional gamer for esports. Thankfully an anonymous one at that. One day, I was framed for cheating at an event. Games were a way for me to make money and not suffer in retail work. I learned that my rival, who went by the pseudonym, xxDubbz, was using powers to make it look like I was cheating. Life took a dark turn afterward. I was betrayed by all my online friends, fans, and sponsors, and it changed my perspective on games for the worse. 

I missed the days when I didn't have to worry about playing games for money, just for fun. Now, my warped ideals about games are to take advantage of the inner workings of games. So I used any dirty trick I could play: cheats, glitches, manipulation, and the worst ploy of them all, Microtransactions. Looking back, I wouldn't say I liked games before I got my powers. 

My past self would think I have turned into a monster, but I have my reasons. Now, this holier-than-thou player is ruining my chess career. Similar to that other player who used his possession powers to make me "admit" to using hacks on everyone. Why does another player want to drag me down when I accomplish the challenges of being a professional player?

I made it to my apartment, defeated by today's events, but what was playing on the TV inspired me to continue. It was "Gone With The Wind," and they played the famous scene where Scarlette said she would lie, cheat, and steal to live in this world. It was enough to get my blood pumping again, and the gears in my brain were starting to turn.


Tournament Day.

That jerk sits back in his chair, thinking he's won the million-dollar prize.

"Come on. It's time for me to win. Don't worry. I won't expose you like how the other super-powered prick did. Tell me before the match starts; how did you get your powers."

Drugs online.

"Ah."

Then the match starts, and immediately the mind reader is thrown off by me. I'm not using my powers. A thousand images of chess strategy's played in my head. E4, Sicilians defenses, King's gambits, the YouTube videos of influencers making top ten strategies. It baffled the mind reader.

"You're not baffling me."

Oh really? Look at the board once in a while, then. He looks at the board. It's as if the board is moving on its own, making its own moves.

"How are you doing that?" He said, and it caught the attention of the narrator, who tells the audience,

"It seems as if he's losing his mind. Talking to himself, he's never done this."

You're embarrassing yourself.

"How are you doing that?" The mind reader mumbled.

You might be a mind reader, but I still have control of my mind. You are trapped here in with me.

"I'll tell your secret to everyone here!"

"What are you talking about?" I replied. It was enough for him to be disqualified from the game. The mind reader lost his sanity, and he lost his million dollars.
