“F!@# you! You don’t kick a guy in the nuts.”

“What are you on about? You have nothing down there.”

“Kicking someone in the Pelvis HURTS.”

“Don’t act like that; there’s more for me, like skin, cartilage, and, you know… nuts.”

“Alright! You’re coming with me to Hell now.”

“No! No, Hell exists? I don’t wanna go.”

“Then don’t kick anyone down there.”

“I was scared! What if a spooky skeleton f!@#er ran towards you?”

“First of all, I am a spooky skeleton f!@#er. Second of all, I’m not going to kick anyone in the nuts.” The guy had enough of Death, running towards him and attempting to kick him down there. Death blocks his kick with his boney hands. “What are you doing? STOP. I’ve told you, it’s not nice to do that.”

“I just found the secret to immortality. You’re not going to stop me.” Death whips out a scythe from thin air, and the blade is raised, looking at its target. “Oh, S&@#!” The man sprints, looking for anything to hurl at Death’s family jewels.

“That’s it. I’m going after your nuts now.” The scythe flies through the air, and the man nearly dodges it. The scythe twirls back into Death’s hands. The man had no place to go except the library. The library attendants notice the man entering, scrambling for his life from an invisible force. The librarian looks up from her desk, unaware of the Arbitrator of Death, and lifts her index finger to her mouth, making a ‘shhh’ noise at the man.

“Lady, you don’t know what is going on!” The man said, and Death started catching on to him, prompting him to finish the conversation another time. The man searches the library for more things to hurl. There were tons of things that could work, books, signs, germ-x bottles, but he picked a fire extinguisher. Quite the heavy object, and was a perfect tool for what would happen next. Death launches his scythe at the man, and the man lifts the fire extinguisher to block it.

*Ding*

The scythe falls towards the ground, making a clank as it falls. The man steps on the blade, fire extinguisher in hand, ready to fight Death head-on. Death waves his hand at the blade, but it struggles to escape from the man’s step.

“Give me back my blade.”

“No!”

“I’m going to make your death horrible and traumatic.”

“I’m going to make it a pain in the ass for you to try.”

“Give me back my scythe. I’ll give you a day if you do.”

“Forget that. Give me peace and quiet.”

“You know I got to do my job.”

“Let me do mine then. There’s all kinds of other candidates for you.”

“You’re next on my list, and I can’t skip.”

“Yes, you can. Who’s next?”

“Agatha.”

“Well, Agatha sounds like a nice lady. Go kill her.”

“Give me my scythe, then.”

“You really need your scythe?”

“I do as the Grim Reaper.”

“Then I’ll take it.”

“No! Don’t take my job.”

“Screw that. I can do it better.” The man leans toward his feet, grabbing the blade between his fingers. His body started turning into dust, leaving behind a skeleton frame. The new reaper tries to hide his pelvis due to embarrassment. The library’s visitors all pointed to where the man was,

“Where did that crazy guy go?”

The old reaper transformed into an old guy, admiring his human form, and then he looked at the new reaper, started to sprint towards him, and launched a kick at his pelvis. “SEE! HOW DOES IT FEEL NOW.”
