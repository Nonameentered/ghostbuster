“I don’t want to attend a meeting from that corporate a-hole.”

“I don’t want to either, but we have to attend we want to maintain the sponsorships.”

“We’re the good guys though. Why can’t they just pay us?”

“Look, if we want to keep our cozy lair, then we’ll have to listen to whatever the UberDude says.”

“Fine.”

“You’ll just zone out in this meeting anyways.”

“You know it!”

“I’ve brought you all here today because I see that we are not maintaining a public image.” The UberDude said. One hero raises his hand, “Yes?”

“What gives? We’re saving people, who cares if we don’t look friendly?”

“Looking friendly is not only going to benefit ArchTech Corp, but it’ll help you out as well.” UberDude walks to his table and takes a sip of water. “Let me show you an example,” he grabs a remote to click forward on his presentation, “This is BugGuy, and through my coaching, he went from being a horrid spider creature to a lady killer.” That same hero raises his hand again and said,

“Wasn’t he cured?”

“Yes.”

“So, you coached him after you cured him right?”

“Yes, and?”

“Well, of course he’s going to be more sociable after he became a normal person. He’s not ugly anymore.”

“I don’t see what appearance has to do with anything.”

“You’re literally here making an argument about how our appearance isn’t up to corporate standards.”

“But! With my coaching, the Justice Team is going to look awesome and more importantly, marketable.”

Silence. Then UberDude continues,

“You see, we all can climb the ladder of success. We can be the most popular super team out here. You’ll have enough money that you wouldn’t have to worry about secret identities, government pension plans, or property damage. All you need to do is look presentable, and take all fights onto company property.”

“Why company property?”

“A skyscraper collapsing is a recipe for a viral video. Imagine, ArchTech building collapses on the street. It’s free advertising.”

“A building collapse can hurt people.”

“Trust me. ArchTech can handle it. Consider it a donation from a generous company.”

“Consider a building falling on someone instead.”

“Look. All I am asking is for you guys to bite the bullet for a while, and try it ArchTech’s way. ArchTech is taking the risk here. It won’t be long before a government program will be enacted and we all know how inefficient the Big Man is, trust me. You’ll want ArchTech’s way, it’ll be clean, efficient, and you get to profit from it too. If the government was to do it, then you won’t be paid for your hard work.”
