The first thing Dole did was to check if anyone else could see the story roles. The word “Villain(?)” appeared on top of him. He noticed it when he passed by a building with enormous windows. The word “Villain(?)” stapled to him would draw unwelcome attention.

Dole found a hiding spot and watched the outside area of a restaurant. The outside people had the word “NPC” floating above their heads. Dole combed through people to find anything that could be different. He was not successful. Everyone carried the same “NPC” tag. Dole left to go home as he wasn’t going to find anything here. 

At his house, Dole went through his YouTube channel. Not a single person had a different tag, and Dole felt as if he was a little unique. However, his word made him think. For example, why is there a question mark following the word? Could he become a villain? Could he be a hero, or maybe an NPC? What kind of path would he take to lead him to become the villain?

Dole took a leap of faith. He went outside after mulling over everything. The walk before was interrupted by the arrival of his prophecy. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the only situation that would interrupt him today. Dole caught the attention of his toxic boss, that fired him long ago. Above his name is the word “Hero.”
