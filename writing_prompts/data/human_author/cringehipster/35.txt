“Don’t touch the LURVIG or you’ll have your hands cut off Thief!” The Shopkeeper yelled at the rogue. The rogue is looking for furniture for his guild. He asks the shopkeeper,

“What’s a LURVIG?”

“Only the finest item you can find in dungeons. You don’t have a cat companion, so I can’t show this to you.”

“Are you telling me that this is a cathouse on wheels?”

“Check the stats.” The rogue did, and he saw a high mobility stat on the LURVIG. He’s never seen mobility stats on a piece of furniture before. The rogue is in for it today as he sees his next item, the FAMNIG HJARTA.

“What’s this heart with arms?”

“I knew you were the lonely type.”

“Hey!”

“Adventurer, this may be the cheapest item in here. Hugging this will make you feel warm and safe.” The rogue couldn’t help but hide a blush. He’d come back a few weeks later to pick up the item when no one is looking. 

“If I might show you this item,” The shopkeeper gestures to a mannequin stand embroidered with lines, “this is the NPEN, perfect for resting your leather armor at the end of the day.”

“I’ll take it.”
