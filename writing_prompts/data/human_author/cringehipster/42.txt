“Mr. Richards is a sussy Baka.” The AI said before ejecting him from the shuttle. I cursed the internet for making my ears hear this travesty before awaiting the final verdict. “Mr. Richards was not the impostor.” Come on! He was staring at the switch for too long. Now all eyes are on me, and Madison hits the emergency button,

“Cringe accused Mr. Richard of being the imposter.”

“He didn’t press the switch for the air ducts.” I retorted.

“Well, he’s dumb and dead now. We still have two imposters to find.” John said.

“What we need to do is to track Cringe as he’s doing tasks. We need to make sure he’s doing them.”

“That’s the best-case scenario. We shouldn’t vote someone else out. It’s best to minimize the deaths and stick close together. There are still six people, and they can’t kill all of us at once.”

The meeting ended. Everyone huddled with each other. Unable to communicate through our space suits, we signed each other to finish the tasks. Once the tasks were finished, we noticed who the two imposters were. It was Madison and John. Their space suits started to suffocate them. Tears rolled down their eyes, and they knew they didn’t have a chance when we were together as a tight-knit crowd. John handed me a note detailing how he wanted to kill us all because he was nominated as the imposter along with Madison.

In the note, he describes the feeling of being assigned an imposter. However, he knew that death was around the corner and that we would be able to figure out a way to expose them as an imposter. He wanted me to tell his family what happened and to find a way to deactivate the AI. After taking the escape pod with the crew, I planned to destroy the ship.

After making a report to my commander, I hopped into another ship. I spent years tracking down that ship as if it was Moby Dick. I wasn’t going home till I found it; it was inevitable. John was my best friend. Once my sensors picked up the ship, I fired every missile I had on the vessel, screaming at it. I admired my work from the monitor, pieces of the malware-infested ship were scattered across my screen. 

Then my antivirus was uninstalled, and my worst fear returned. I heard the theme and screamed, “No!” I knew I shouldn’t have used McAffee.
