"They are back." A caveman says.

"Ah. More fighting to be had!" Jhaun said. "Grab the laser rifles."

The time travelers arrive in a new timeline, this one where the troglodytes are aware of their shenanigans to steal their world from them. The cavemen called these travelers bigots for calling them "cavemen." After all, you wouldn't like to be called something lesser, would you?

Jhaun lifted his sniper rifle over a cliff and peered through the sight. Ten travelers armed with similar weaponry to Jhaun's army. Jhaun sent out the signal to his army, and lasers and lightsabers ambushed the ten people. The group quickly fell, but not before calling backup. Another group entered to rescue the previous group. Unfortunately, the new group hasn't received the memo.

The time travelers were not expecting advanced weapons. If only the time travelers were aware of their previous history. It's a shame that their previous history is disguised as a movie called "Star Wars." The people forgot the lines "a long time ago" and "In a Galaxy far, far, away."
