Another day, another shot at chasing tail. Maybe Cupcake down the street will be let out of the house. Hopefully, her owner doesn't see me putting on the moves. She's a beautiful Dutch hound, and her owner cheats her life through showmanship.

I wanted to get into the fame and wealth of being a show dog, but I don't meet their obsience standards. Apparently, my body is too long for showing. I'll show those "show dogs" what long really is. My original owner handed me over to another guy because of my genetics.

This guy was a prick. He's always yelling at me and hitting me. I got him back though. One day, he left a plate of simmering nachos on the counter. It was near the edge of the table and in my digestive system in seconds.

There were consequences, but worth it. My punishment made me think. About how all owners are evil. My last two are an excellent example of this. Life is better when you are independent, and free from being cared for by others.

Sure, it's not secure, but it's my life. I did things that I wouldn't be able to do when I was owned by humans. One day, I chased a female all over a college campus. I was laughed at by the people all day, but I didn't care. I was out there, doing my own thing.
