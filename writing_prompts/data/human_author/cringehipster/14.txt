The Necromancer was right, Bob thought. Bob doesn’t trust anyone ever since the events of that deadly dungeon run. There will always be a moment in which a friend will betray you. It’s happened multiple times to him, with each party thinking that this time, this party, he’ll have a place. Bob was about to join the Necromancer, but he had a question.

“You’re not trying to steal my body now, are you?” Bob grabbed the dagger from the dungeon floor, it may be a hallucination, but this was Bob’s moment, life, and rules. He pierced the Necromancer in his stomach, and the Necromancer let out a gasp.

“Why?”

“I don’t trust anyone.”

“I saved you! What has anyone else done for you.”

“I barely know you. Thanks for saving me, but you’re rushing me to decide on a big life decision. At least when I had my previous party, my expectations were low, yet they all relied on me. They asked me for help, not to change myself. The thing about friendship that I learned, the thing about PEOPLE that I learned, is that it’s more important to give than to take.” The Necromancer bent over, clutching his wound. 

“You think… that you truly have friends? All this talk of friendship is wasting time. While you were here, you were off trying to kill your teammates with your so-called ‘sniper rife!’”

“No… No, no, no.”

Bob lurched back to reality and looked around for any signs of his crew. But no one was around; worse, his sniper rifle was on the ground, bent up and destroyed. Bob rested on his back, utterly defeated and depressed. He could guess what had happened. He must have fought back against the party members, and they must have killed him again. Bob is tired of dying, as he didn’t move for hours, hoping they would return to him.
