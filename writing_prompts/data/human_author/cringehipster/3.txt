Back at the cave of Eons, Bob stared at the Necromancer.

"What are you still doing here?"

"I keep hearing your voice call for me."

"You've been here for so long that you keep hearing voices."

Have I been here for that long? Bob thought as an unfamiliar face was staring back at him. Who was this? Why is he here? This didn't look like the Necromancer he was journeyed with.

"Who are you?" Bob shouted.

"I thought you would never find out."

Before Bob knew it, the world started to crumble before his eyes. His surroundings melted into a different setting, the campfire before the battle.

"Come on! Let's get this business with the Necromancer over with!" The Fighter said.

This was clouding Bob's mind. It seemed to him that all the events afterward were merely a nightmare. Bob wiped the sweat from his brow. What a horrible nightmare.

"Are we leaving finally?" The Wizard asked.

"Yes, we are," Bob said with a smile. The group turned to leave, but the box of bullets appeared in Bob's hand. "NO!" Bob screamed before he saw another version of himself cocking the sniper rifle and unloading it on his teammates. Each one fell on the ground, and Bob could do nothing; not even standing in front of the Fighter's body was enough to stop the bullet. Bob rushed to the side of the Cleric, who was grabbing Bob's shoulder.

"I thought we would always be together? Why would you do this to us?"

"I didn't want to."

"Yes, he did." A voice said, and Bob turned his head to see the first party who betrayed him. "Good job! You finally learned something from us!"

"I never thought he would do it," another party member sneered.

"Stop this." Bob pleaded.

"Ew. Who is this guy? Come on, Bob.  Let’s go kill the Necromancer." The party leaves, taking the other Bob, leaving the true one on his knees.

"See? I was right." The dream Necromancer returned and grabbed Bob’s hair. "You will always be al-." The false Necromancer struggled to finish his sentence and coughed.

"You will..."

"Always be al-" A piercing light emanated from the false Necromancer's chest.

"Arghh! What’s going on?"

"He won't be alone. As long as I am here." The true Necromancer returned, ripping the vision of the imposter in half. Bob's eyes dripped with tears. The setting again changed to the dungeon where Bob was saved. Bob clung to the Necromancer as he held him. "I'm sorry I couldn't get there sooner." The Necromancer said.

"I thought you were going to betray me," Bob said.

"This is why we needed trust."

"The same thing happened to you?"

"Yeah. Thankfully I have experience with the whole dream manipulation thing." The setting collapsed, revealing an open door to the third trial.

"That was... rough," Bob said as he brushed himself off and wiped the tears with his clothes. "Let's get this Elixirium."

The door to the third trial stood ominously to the duo. They looked at the words of the final door.

*Only one may pass.*

"Easy." The Necromancer said as he pushed Bob to the door.

"What are you doing?"

"I knew this was going to happen." A beam of light shined through the Necromancer, ripping a hole into him. Bob ran back to the Necromancer, holding him as the Necromancer coughed blood.

"Why! It shouldn't be you. I wouldn't have done this if I knew this was going to happen." The Necromancer grabs Bob's chin to quiet him.

"Because I knew this was going to happen."

"Then why did you give me a choice?"

"Because I am selfish. I wanted this to happen. I didn't have long, so I wanted to go out like you."

"I wouldn't want you to die for me."

"Even when you barely know me?"

"That doesn't matter to me. I had known my first party members for a long time before they left me for dead. I learned that time doesn't dictate trust."  The Necromancer's eyes were fading.

"Listen to me. Use my skills to defeat the Necromancer. Then, when the time comes, pass them to someone else. Let the guild know that necromancers are not always bad people."

"I will. I promise."

"Heh. What do you know? Maybe being a good person isn't all that bad after all." Then his body faded, leaving behind an aura that was absorbed by Bob. Bob could hear footsteps, but he didn't care. He still was shocked at the sacrifice he had just witnessed. Finally, a hand is placed on Bob's shoulders, and he turns to see everyone there.

"I'm sorry." This was what the Cleric could muster the strength to say as the party mourned.
