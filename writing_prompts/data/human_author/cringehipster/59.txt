Even looking in the mirror, the time of my death is the same as everyone else’s. Something out there will bring us all back alive and kill us for the final time. Our last death is unknown to me, even when I can figure out what time. It doesn’t stop getting stranger, as people are still dying earlier than expected. I snuck into the morgue and confirmed that. All the inhabitants of the morgue are still going to die 3000 years from now. 

The only way I can scientifically explain this is with religion. That would mean, however, that means Revelations is going to happen. So, if I were to publish this paper, I would be called a madman or fundamentally change religion as we know it. But, on the other hand, that would mean that the Bible is real, God is real, and there’s an easy ticket to heaven. 

I’m a scientist, so I must publish this. Someone whose more creative than I can come up with a better hypothesis than the one I can't stomach. I can’t use religion as a cheap way to explain this. There’s always a logical reason, and I learned that long ago. That’s why I no longer believe in ghosts, ufos, or other supernatural things; however, the gears in my brain are turning. 

It would be logical to visit church since I have some reasonable evidence to justify my going. Perhaps, going will allow me to do more research and find a better answer. I can publish the paper out there while I’m taking a leap of faith. After all, it’s what God would have wanted. At least I can have a God to side with when 3000 years arrive.
