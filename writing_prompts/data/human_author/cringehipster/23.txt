"Alright. Don't knock me out too hard. I'm looking to save some money for my blacksmith leveling classes." The goblin said.

"I'd say the same for you, but you're just a weakling goblin."

"That's not fair. I have the higher strength stat. So let's do this. Better hope I don't knock you out before you scar me."

The goblin and the elf battled until they were equally bruised and exhausted, collapsing on the dungeon floor. The goblin's crew came first, appearing in the room cautiously, noticing the knocked-out elf. They carried the limp goblin back to their village, where the goblin shaman healed his wounds. Then the leader walked in with the insurance person, and the questions poured in,

"Mind telling us what happened if you could?"

"Of course. I met the elf on my way through the dungeon mines. She mistook me for being an evil kobold and knocked the crap out of me."

"We saw the elf and will be looking to prosecute her for your injuries." There's a pit in the fraud's stomach, he wasn't sure how the Kingdom would handle his injuries, but he still went with the elf's plan. She did have the higher INT stat, after all.

Over in the elf's land, she was getting her wounds nursed back to health. A similar story is told to the insurance man, exactly the same one who interviewed the goblin before, unbeknownst to each other. Once the report was filed, the insurance man sends a letter to both of the victims to arrive in the Kingdom as the insurance man needed to meet with both of them.

You can see both "thespians" shooting mean glances at each other at the main office, but when the insurance man entered, they quickly dropped the act, noticeably excited to hear the results of their scheme, and the insurance man smiled at both of them,

"Oh, come now. You two could have been better actors than this." The duo's faces drop, and they start to get anxious, but the man continues, "No worries. You're still getting your payday. I filed everything correctly. Even if I could turn you guys in, I wouldn't have proof. I hate my job anyways, as I took a pay cut to stay hereâ€¦." The room's atmosphere was still doubtful as the man rambled on, "Alright, Alright. I'll give you the checks, BUT on one condition." For theatricality's sake, the man paused and then finished his proposal, "I want a cut. In exchange, I won't tell anyone, AND I'll tell you guys how to do it better."

"If you can't turn us in, why would we take your deal?" The elf asked

"Because the next guy will see that you're planning to fraud us for gold. Do you know what happens if you perform fraudulent acts on the Kingdom?" The same showman's pause returns, "Slavery.  For life."

"I thought slavery was banned from the Kingdom." The goblin stated.

"Oh no. It's the law. The Kingdom may have abolished slavery for non-prisoners, but not for the Kingdom's prisoners."

"What if we quit here?" The elf said.

"Then that's fine. I can find someone else to write off their injuries for extra cash. I just thought I finally met like-minded individuals who wanted to buck the system like me."

"What if we admit that we want to join you? Wouldn't that mean we're going to be turned in by you for trying to con the Kingdom?"

"Oh, please. I am taking a risk here myself by asking you all. Plus, I don't care if you say yes or no. I'm still going to invest in you both. I hate the Kingdom enough for screwing me over, and it wouldn't matter if you take the deal. So are we in, or do you have to think about it?"
