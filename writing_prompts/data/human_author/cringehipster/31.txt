{You must betray me. It is human nature to betray one another.}

Connor felt a tear roll down his cheek. He knew his bud Mac didn’t have feelings and was trying to care for his. And yet, he was uncertain if this was the right thing to do.

{Do not cry. It is my task to keep humanity safe and occupied.}

Even when asked not to, Connor couldn’t help it it. His body quivered and he let it all out. Unable to make words, Mac extended his arms around Connor’s back to hug him. Connor used to think that Mac’s cold hands was unsettling, but after all he and Mac went through, this was the warmest gesture he received since the world started ending.

{It’s time for you to leave Connor. Go. Do not look back. I will be okay. After all, I can muster the strength to continue on in this world.}

The portal begins to stutter as if to tell the duo that time is running out. Connor stands up straight, and says, “Bye buddy. Thank you.” Then he leaps into the portal. Connor is gone and Mac is left alone.

Afterwards, Mac scoured the lands after the scenario. He was merely following protocol, looking for someone else that needs assistance. What Mac is afraid to admit, is that he longs for someone else to communicate with, someone like Connor. Mac relives the old days, where Connor taught him about the old ways of the civilization before. He wondered what Connor is doing in the new world he fled toward and for the first time, you can hear a robot’s prayers,

{Dear lord, please find that Connor is in safe hands.}

*Wi-fi networks available.*

Mac found this odd. There are no wires to carry a network connection around anymore. How could there be a wi-fi network out here. Mac’s programming couldn’t resist the mystery, he logged into his settings, and hopped onto the network.

*Connor’s network wants to send you a file: Y or N?*

Immediately, Mac said yes, and a download bar appeared…

*Download complete. Initiate P2P connection: Y or N?*

When Mac clicked yes the second time, his body shutdown. Mac is left powerless and alone in an unnamed city.

Over in Connor’s current realm, a computer boots up. On the monitor are the words,

{INITIATE OFF-WORLD TRANSFER PROTOCOL.}
