After Nietzsche stated that God was dead, the God of Abraham decided to retire and let humans run things for a while. God went on to other worlds and projects before returning to see what the humans have accomplished. They almost killed themselves off with crony capitalism, global warming, and addiction to social media. To God, it’s hilarious how drastically the world changed after he was proclaimed dead by some random german. Disappointed, he anoints Moses to take control of society. 

With Moses coming back, there would be a new plague; however, those acts are cruel. It’s time for a new way to influence the people, and it’s through trophies. God was going to award ten plaques to those who he deemed as worthy. In a world that’s full of negativity, God can empower the world with positivity. The world’s largest award show is hosted this year, with guest appearances such as Jesus, Abel, and the Pope.

Moses steps up to the podium in front of an audience of millions and says, “Good Evening, everyone! I hope all of you were able to unplug your metaverse adapter for five minutes.” There’s a tiny bit of laughter in the audience, but you can tell that it’s been a while since Moses talked to people. “It’s my honor to announce God’s Ten Plaques to be awarded this year. They were easier to make than the Ten Commandments! With me is Jesus Christ.”

“Hello! Salutations and greetings to everyone! I hope that I am a good co-host with Moses here.”

“So far, you’re nailing it, buddy!” You can see some irritation on Jesus’s face. The audience groans. “Alrighty! Since this is our first showing, I’m going to go over all the rules and let Jesus take it over. Each award is called a commandment.”

“Wait! I thought we decided on the disciple.”

“Oh, come on. Disciple doesn’t sound good at all.”

“It’s better than a commandment. You’re confusing everyone.”

“Hey, God elected me! I am better than his own son.”

“I was grounded! Quit pretending that you’re the main character of the Bible again. That was Old Testament!”
