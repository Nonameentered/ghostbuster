"Mista Jay? What's da matter?"

Joker shakes the glass in his hands. The ice cubes hit the sides, making a vigorous clink. Harley backs out of the room, leaving Joker to brood. Several skyscrapers always, Cobblepot is reading the Gotham Gazette before tossing it on the table. Under an obituary for Bruce Wayne is an article for another masked vigilante that acts like a spider. So Cobblepot phones one of his friends, the Bad Samaritan.

"Find me this Spider-man."

Even after mourning Bruce's death, Oracle searched for this new masked vigilante. Her first clue is at the Gotham Gazette. She heads to the office of Peter Parker, the photographer of Spider-Man. Peter lets her into his office, and in the background is a voicemail of J. Jonah Jameson's disappointed voice. Peter cuts it off before Oracle can listen to it.

"Barbra Gordon?"

"Yes."

"It's nice meeting you. How can I help the daughter of the police chief Gordon?"

"Tell me, why do you follow Spider-man?"

"Easy money."

"But you're smart enough to get a job somewhere more prestigious."

"The hours are better here. Plus, it's less stressful."

"Isn't it dangerous, though? To be where ever Spider-man is?"

"In New York, it was thrilling, to be honest. The terrifying Rhino, Green Goblin, and Doc Ock kept me on my toes. Here, it's calendar man, condiment king, and -" Peter is interrupted by his spidey sense. Warning him of danger, and it's coming in an elevator towards him. "Ms. Gordon, I'll have to leave. I forgot that Spider-man is tracking down some armed robberies. My uh secretary will lead you out." He leaves.

Oracle looks around Peter's office since he's gone. She won't hear clues from Peter's mouth. So she has to look for them. It's not tidy, and the desk is saddled with newspaper articles. The recent issue of Gotham Gazette is on top, and it's on that obituary of Bruce Wayne's death. A tear rolls down her cheek. The door opens, and a tall, dark-haired sunglass-wearing man enters. 

"Oh. Is Peter Parker here?" The Bad Samaritan asks. His accent is Russian.

"No. He just left."

"Thank you." The door closes, and the Bad Samaritan walks past a closet. In that closet is Peter spying on him. He suits up, and it's time to follow the Bad Samaritan.
