“How are you even able to cast a fireball that way? It’s unnatural.”

“Shut up. I don’t need your elitist college degrees to tell me how to cast spells.” The classic sorcerer shot a fireball and the self taught one easily dodges it. “Your spell doesn’t even look like a fireball, much less an efficient cast.”

“This is the proper way to cast the spell.”

“No. Look at this.” The self taught wizard shoots a fireball from his finger. “See? I can cast it quicker.”

“You’re going to set yourself on fire like that.”

“What are you talking about? I’ve been doing this for four years.”

“Are you crazy? How haven’t you burned off all the hair?”

“Well, that’s how I shave. I can control it with ease.”

“You can’t use magic recklessly like that. Magic is meant for grander things in life.”

“You’re saying this to someone who can cast faster than you.”

“A fireball isn’t a fast casting spell. A specialist uses a holy bolt instead.” With a wave of his hand, the classic sorcerer lets out a divine spark, almost faster than the fireball.

“I admit. That’s incredible. I can’t cast a holy bolt like that.”

“Exactly, you just need practice under an efficient tutor like myself.”

“Are you kidding me? You only care that you’re better than me. When we still have much to learn?”

“I’m not wanting to learn from someone who didn’t go to my school.”

“With your skill level and mine, we can learn from each other. Then we can write a book about the most efficient methods to cast certain spells.”

“The most efficient method is mine.”

“Oh Really?” The self taught warlock lifts his finger for another fireball.

“Hold it! I’m willing to hear you out. No more fireballs”

“You and I. We know a lot, and if we were to combine our knowledge, we can sell it for good cash. That’s what you told me, to use your magic for grander things.”

“But the magic industry is a prestigious academy, they won’t accept your word.”

“They won’t accept my word unless I go to college.”

“And how would you do that?”

“Come on. You’re more of an expert in that than me. Give me my free education. You keep going on about how you need me to go to school to learn how to be better then prove me wrong. ”
