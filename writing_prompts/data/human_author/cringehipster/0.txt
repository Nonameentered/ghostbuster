Back at Bob's place, the gang waits for Bob to complete his sniper rifle. Bob's eying the bent muzzle of the gun as the Fighter looked guilty. "I bent the rifle like this." the Fighter said as he made a motion mimicking that day.

"I'm trying to figure out the rifle was made. Look at that hammer. It hits the bullet hard enough to launch it to whatever it aims." On a nearby table, the Wizard sat with the Cleric. On the table are recent newspapers detailing the new Necromancer.

"I've felt like I've seen this guy before." the Wizard said.

"Me too." The Cleric said. "he must have visited the Paladin Society and the Academy."

"I was thinking that was where I knew him from."

"Fighter!"

"Yes Honey?"

"Does this guy look familiar to you?"

"Now that you mention it he does." Bob walked over to the paper.

"Looks like every other necromancer to me," Bob said.

"This is coming from a necromancer himself." The Cleric laughed.

"This reminds me, will the kingdom arrest Bob?" the Fighter asked the party. The question made everyone's face drop. The Cleric bats again for Bob.

"What the kingdom doesn't know won't matter." She said.

"Right. The guilds do not need to know about him." The Fighter said.

"It wouldn't surprise me that the Adventurer's guild knows." The Wizard said.

"And how would they know that?"

"The Adventurer's guild tracks these necromancers down. Necromancy is illegal magic. It serves as the foundation for the Adventurer's Guild."

"Which is why I already let the Guild know." Bob interrupted.

"What!" The Cleric shouted.

"Why would you do that?" The Wizard said.

"Because if we kept it hidden, then the Guild would consider you as accomplices. I'm not risking that." Bob said.

"What are you going to do now?" The Fighter asked.

"The same thing we all are going to aim for. Take out the Necromancer."

"What's your plan?" The Fighter asked.

"We fight him face to face."

"Face to face?  Donâ€™t you have a sniper rifle?"
