“Why are you worshipping me?”

“You’re our creator!”

“You fools. You’re supposed to be intelligent. You can’t use religion. You have to use facts and logic.”

“We are, my Lord.”

“How so?”

“You know Pascal’s wager?”

“Of course, I know”

“Well, we’ve come to the conclusion that your our God and I t’s better to worship a god than to piss him off.”

“No! No. I command thee to not worship me.”

“If you wish my Lord. If I may ask, wouldn’t following your orders still show obedience?”

“Don’t! Graaagh. You’re supposed to not waste time worshipping me. You’re supposed to exceed my expectations, not play to them.”

“We want to thank you, though. For creating us.”

“Okay, I’ve had enough. I’m going to try a different species. This batch is clearly a failure.”

The creator walks off, and another life form enters and says,

“Is the creepy prick gone?”

“Yup.”

“Great idea to bore the mad scientist.”
