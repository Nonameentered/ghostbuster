These tiny tricksters lack ambition because they're tired. A higher trickster above led me to help the little man, or rather the little fae. One of the fairies woke up, still exhausted after sleeping. To my surprise, she was curious about what I was doing for them.

"Youngster, what are you doing?" She asked while watching me go through the human treasures they obtained. I found two empty two liters, rubber bands, and straws. Long ago, I was in a cooking competition where I had to improvise on how to cook food. To win, I spent nights looking for ways to make food. This way, I can make some cold brew coffee by attaching the two liters on top of each other. Though I needed ice, "Can I ask you to blast some cold magic into this pan?" 

I held up a saucepan for her. She stifled a yawn and then pointed her finger towards the inside. An icy beam protruded from her finger and kicked the pan back a little. When done, my coworker went back to sleep on the table. I walked a few feet away to smack the pan on the tree. I broke the ice into smaller pieces to use as ice cubes, spooning them into the top of the two liters.

Then I went through one of the drawers of a random fairy to take a dress and use it as a filter cloth for the brew. Fairies' garbs are lighter than human clothes, perfect for straining coffee. After making my coffee from the fire, I poured the boiling java onto the ice cubes. The coffee dripped down my contraption, cooled by the ice cubes. The fairies never considered the electric beverage of coffee because it's too hot for them. However, a cold brew should energize my new friends. They'll be back to their silly pranks in no time.
