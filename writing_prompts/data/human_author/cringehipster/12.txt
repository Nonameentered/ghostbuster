Time passed as Bob slowly devolved into old ways, forgetting about his ordeal with parties and dungeoneering. He opted to live on the outskirts of the kingdom. He was broke and taking odd jobs to spend money at the tavern. The Adventurer's Guild wasn't going to leave him alone, as they sent Bob letters asking about what happened with the Necromancer. Bob was avoiding the guild, as the Necromancer may be alive since he's alive. But the guild lady from before showed up at Bob's shack, knocking on his door. She opened it to a Bob lying on the ground. Bob sat up, looking at the lady,

"Ah. Oh no. You haven't come to ask me about the Necromancer, have you?"

"Yes. I have."

"I don't know what happened." Bob laid back down.

"It's odd because all the other party members said you knew what happened. Since the Necromancer has mysteriously vanished after you returned."

"I don't know anything."

"You know something because you have sat here rotting away in your shack. At least give me a report."

"I went with the party to kill the Necromancer, and we didn't, so we gave up. End of story."

"You realize that lying to a ranking member of the kingdom is a crime?" Bob groans and then says,

"Basically, I made the party to kill the Necromancer, and then I was going to kill my party members to claim the reward for myself. However, I was killed before I started the journey. Then I was resurrected by the Necromancer, who I didn't even know resurrected me. Then I got into a dream sequence with the Necromancer, where I stabbed him, and now he's gone. Who knows, since I am still alive, he may still be in me." As Bob went over all the details, the guild member diligently wrote his words down in the report. "You're, uh, not surprised?"

"Bob, we live in a world where magic is common. So this is common necromancer stuff."

"What about me? What are you going to do with me? I might have the necromancer within me."

"You stabbed him in the dream thing you had going on, right?"

"Yeah."

"I doubt he could take control of your body if you could resist him."

"But I was about to kill my party."

"Were you?"

"No."

"I think as hard as the Necromancer could try, he could take over your body, but he wouldn't be able to get you to do something you never wanted in the first place."

"But, I initially started the journey with the idea that I would kill them."

"Why?"

"Because I thought they were evil."

"Were they?"

"No."

"Exactly. You learned who they truly are. Yeah, your intentions were not good, but you couldn't follow through. You're not a bad guy, and you're not a good guy. You're just Bob, and you're about to recieve taxpayer money."

"What?"

"You have to take the reward. There's no refusal here."

"I didn't kill the Necromancer!"

"Sounds to me like you did."

"What if he comes back?"

"Bob, he's a Necromancer. The quest was to kill the Necromancer, and if he came back, it wouldn't matter. That's what necromancers do, and my dilemma is this. I got to make the quota of a certain budget, and if I don't spend it, it'll lower next year. Take the money."

"Can I donate it somewhere?"

"You can do whatever you want with it."

"I'd like to donate it to the Wizard's academy."

"Do it yourself. If you want forgiveness, take the steps needed to get out of this shack. You remember what you said to me about the dream part with the Necromancer?"

"You're right. Thank you."
