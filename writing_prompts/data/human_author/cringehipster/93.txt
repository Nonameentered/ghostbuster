The timer on my phone shows 55 minutes. Eleven strangers in this room, and which of us will make the sacrifice? I don't speak up. I don't want any peer pressure on me to open that box. Surely, there must be some martyr among us. It's a 1 in 11 chance from all the people here. Then, finally, someone speaks up.

"This is a test." One guy said. People say you can judge a person in a tenth of a second. Whoever created this game must be enjoying my perspective. You can see the guy fiddling with his pocket. His chest raises for a brief moment to show confidence, but he's unable to keep the act. 

"I'm not pressing that button," a man wearing a trucker cap speaks, "I got a wife and kids.". He seems to be one of those irritable types of people. He'll be a pain to convince.

"What's your name?" A shifty individual asked.

"No one tell him." A charismatic guy says, "He's just looking to manipulate us."

"How?"

"You're trying to get in our head." Charisma is right on the nose. The shifty guy scoffs as he leans back in his seat. Charisma is my best chance of convincing someone else to open the box. 

"Let's take a break, everyone. We have 45 minutes left." I say, now ready to open up. The room gets split into different cliques. As part of my plan, I go to the box in the middle to confirm everything. Charisma walks up to me. 

"It's insane. Isn't it?"

"Yeah."

"So, what are you thinking?"

"Why would I tell you?"

"Because you and I are similar."

"What do you mean?"

"Well, we don't want to open the box."

"You can say the same thing for everyone here."

"But you're smart. Even smarter than me."

My heart races. I tune him out while he's spinning his sales pitch. I look at the box to calm down. The box has the note on top with a discarded pen.

"So, come on. What do you got?"

"One of us wrote the note."

"Really?"

"It's just a theory."

"Tell me more."

"Look around. There are no cameras. If I were to setup something like this, I would want to watch what's unfolding."

"That's pretty smart. Okay. From now on, we're a team now. All right?"

"Yeah."

"I'll take care of you now."

Charisma walks off. I grab the note and the pen.

Our break ended, and we were back into a circle. Charisma steps forward.

"I've talked with everyone, and I found something that you guys will want to hear." He makes eye contact with me, and I nod. "One of us in this very room has set us all up."

"You're kidding!" A mom says.

"Someone in this room is watching us argue." There is mumbling throughout the room.

"So, who is it?" The trucker asks.

"Him." Charisma points at me, and I felt the mass of glares on me.

"Why would you do this to us?" The mom snapped. I raise my eyebrows.

"What do you mean?" I asked Charisma.

"You told me your plan. After all, how would you know to look for cameras or to tell me that the person responsible is in this room? It's suspicious."

"Okay. Let's say, hypothetically, and I do mean hypothetically," I said to the furious mother, "that I set this up. How would I… kill everyone in this room?"

"I wouldn't know that. Maybe those vents up there will flood the room with gas."

"Wow! You were Johnny on the spot with that answer. It's 'suspicious.'"

"Oh, please. You obviously planned this."

"He did," Shifty said.

"That's why you should open the box. After all, the one who made this twisted game deserves to lose. And you lose."

"News flash, I didn't make the game. Oh, and you cannot force me to open the box." Charisma stomps towards me, his face close to mine. I can feel his hot breath on my nose.

"I can torture you in the…." He reaches into my pocket and grabs my phone, showing everyone the timer, "next 30 minutes. When I'm done, you'll want to open your present."

"He will not open that box." Shift shouted.

"Why?"

"Cause he gave me this to write down to show everyone." He shows the note I handed him earlier.

"So, that's the note from the box. That doesn't matter."

"Cept, he told me everything, and I wrote it down on the back. Then I gave the pen to that guy." Shifty points to the trucker, who pulls out the pen. Shifty flips the page over, and his words are there for everyone.

"I'm not much for those who talk their way out of situations." The trucker states.

"I even heard your promise that you made to him. Horrid stuff, mate." Shifty said.

"Pretty odd that you took what I guessed and used it to pin 
on me." I said to Charisma. I was proud of myself. I knew back then in my cult days how a smooth-talking manipulator acts. I had the whole room chanting for Charisma to open that cursed box. I did try to convince them that he was scared and wanted to escape like all of us, but I didn't protest enough. The eight other people were on my side and thought I was innocent. They played into my hands. 

The crowd chased Charisma to that box, and he opened it. A part of the wall slides open, and a gun shoots Charisma. He falls onto the floor, dropping the box. A note slips out, and Shifty reads it aloud.

"Congrats! Now two more people to earn your freedom."
