"This guy is all talk. He hasn't seen a true battle."

"If that's the case, then why did he get to enter Valhalla?"

Odin stayed quiet throughout the drama. Odin picked the right candidate to face these so call traditional warriors. Oliver took the warriors chiding in stride. It was all talk from them until one "brave" warrior was ready to face him,

"You ain't got the guts to dine with us in the halls of Valhalla." The warrior lifts the axe from his back and holds it next to Oliver's neck. Odin's wife jumps up, her face irritated, but Odin holds his hand up. Oliver pulls out his gaming setup, a mouse, a keyboard, and a controller.

Using the cord from the mouse, he whips the warrior at his eyes, causing him to drop his axe. The warrior is gripping his face, and Oliver takes the opportunity to smack him across the face with his keyboard. The warrior fell to the floor. It was impossible to read the room as everyone was stunned. Then the crowd erupted,

"He took out Fray!"

"I couldn't believe it myself."

"What weapons is he using? I got to try them out!"

Odin sat on his throne, wearing a proud smile. Although Oliver has the determination of a warrior, he found his fighting in peaceful ways, like gaming or self-defense.
