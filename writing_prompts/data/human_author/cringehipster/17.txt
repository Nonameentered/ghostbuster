For Bob, life started to get better. He finally found himself among peers who wanted his help. Bob found himself more sociable as time passed, and the adventure continued to its end. Nevertheless, the box containing the bullets haunted him as if telling him of a darker reality. The night before the big battle, Bob started cleaning his gun. The Fighter was making moves on the Cleric while the Wizard was reading. Once Bob was finished, he opened the box containing the three bullets, eyeing the cylinders of death with disgust before tossing it away over a cliff. 

The next day, the heroes arrived at the lair of the Necromancer. Bob planned for the squad to move through the lair stealthily. Bob set up his rifle overlooking the heroes, ready to take on whatever is coming. Then the Necromancer arrived.

The Fighter readied his gloves, the Cleric held her staff in the back lines, and the Wizard hastily unrolled scrolls before the Necromancer held up his hand to stop the heroes.

“Before we begin. I want to tell you all something.” The heroes looked at Bob, and Bob raised his hand in a clenched fist. A symbol to cease fire for the Necromancer’s words. An enormous mistake. The Necromancer pulled out the box with the three bullets, tossing it before the heroes. “See this? Bob was about to betray you.”

The Fighter picked up the bullets, opening the box. His face turned to a frown before tossing it to the Wizard. The Wizard opened the box, pulled a bullet out, and showed it to the others. “You can tell that these bullets were crafted to kill us. Look at how it was designed.”  The heroes looked at Bob for an explanation. Bob’s chest begins to tighten, and words start to burst out,

“I was... I … I didn’t want to.”

Nothing could convince Bob’s new friends that he had changed his ill intentions.
