"I found out how the Candyland Champion wins."

"How?"

"You won't like it, Hasbro."

"Out with it. I must know."

"Well, finding the Candyking is all about luck."

"If that's the case, then the Candyland Champion is lucky."

"That's one possible answer."

"What else could it be?"

"Well, Candyland is a card based game.

"Right."

"What type of game do you cheat the most on?"

"Videogames!"

"No!"

"But using cheat codes is a part of videogames. It's tradition!"

"Alright, speaking of tradition. What's one of the oldest games in the world?"

"Chess!"

"Try again."

"Hide and seek?"

"No! Card games! It's card games!"

"But Candyland is a board game?"

"With cards!"

"No! You're not saying..."

"Yes! He's always insistant of shuffling the deck before matches. I even watched him distract a player, and fumbled through the deck."

"I can't believe this! He should be executed!"

"Hasbro, he's nine. He's a child. Children are full of prankster energy."

"I can't believe we made a game that's easy to cheat in!"

"Don't worry.I got a solution."

"What is it?"

"Instead of cards,we make it a wheel."

"You're a genius! We save money from not printing the cards!"

"I was thinking more along the lines of fair play, but sure. Whatever."
