After being beaten by the Justice League on Earth, Darkseid retreated to Apokolips to recover his pride. With half of his Parademon army wiped out, Darkseid schemed revenge. To become powerful, Darkseid needed planets to enlist them into troops. He scoured the galaxy for worlds unknown to the Green Lantern Core, finding a few that slipped under their radar. Most were uninhabitable, but one, in particular, was absent from superheroes.

Using a boom tube, Darkseid was transported to the planet. He found something in the world that beats the Anti-life equation, a training ground created by a previous civilization. This training ground was called a System Apocalypse, and it relied on video game mechanics to justify the rules of the world. Upon killing monsters on the planet, his level increases along with his stats. Once Darkseid could level up, he could fully recover all of his injuries, even those he sustained from Earth.

While Darkseid was getting stronger, the Justice League was busy dealing with Lex Luther running a crooked election. Lex Luther running for president would mean complex laws for the Justice League's international jurisdiction. Everyone in the Justice League was worried about the potential of a President Luther, except one. Batman wasn't concerned about who was running for president.

No matter what laws are in place, Batman would be there to enact justice. President Luther wasn't a threat compared to his anxiety about what happened to Darkseid after their recent confrontation. After extensive research on planet Apokolips, he found plans to conquer planets outside the Green Lantern Corps sight, leading Batman to pilot a space shuttle towards Darkseid's new planet.

When he landed, Batman quickly figured out what Darkseid was doing after his war on Earth. With the planet being far off from the watchtower, Batman had to grind levels for himself to compete with Darkseid. The planet used RPG game mechanics; when prompting him to select an RPG class, Batman concluded that Darkseid must have picked the Warrior class. So Batman decided on the sneaky rogue class to counter Darkseid, which matched his playstyle.
