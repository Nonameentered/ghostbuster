Kill the gods? Hello? They made me. If I go through with this, there’s not a single chance of me coming out of this without a torturous afterlife to look towards to. What have they done that was worth the hostility? I find it hypocritical to hear that mom screaming at her child, “I made you so I can take you out of this world.” Then she wants me to take out the gods.

Well, not her, but the whole kingdom wants the Gods dead. The king’s been begging me to journey to the top of the mountain to fight them. This king is suspiciously egomaniacal. What will he do when there’s a world without rules created by the divine. His kingdom would crumble from the people who want to take his place. And what about the afterlife? Wouldn’t anyone want to live in something after death?

Sleep is good and all, but I’d prefer an afterlife where I can do something. This kingdom isn’t forward-thinking; wouldn’t you want the protection of gods? From the astrologians I conversed with, some cosmic horror, like a black hole, could annihilate our ambition, consciousness, and achievements. You bet your ass that I would want a miracle.
