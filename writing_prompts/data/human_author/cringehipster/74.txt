"Mightyena used bite!" The dialogue box said as a sharp pain shoots up my arm. The DOG BIT ME! I'M A ROTOM. I AM A GHOST TYPE! HOW WAS THIS DOG ABLE TO BITE ME, OWWW? I lost Twenty HP, and the pain stopped. The Mightyena was bobbing back and forth, watching me. Now it's my turn! "Rotom used Thundershock! Mightyena is paralyzed!" Thirty HP was taken away from Mightyena's health bar, and then, "Mightyena is paralyzed! Rotom used Thundershock! Mightyena has fainted!" He dropped an Oran berry, and I gobbled it up. Strangely delicious!

Munchlax ran towards me, "Are you okay?" My HP is back to full. No other wild Pokémon wanted to eat me. Yeah. I am fine for now. "Hey, if you need to go back to the guild to rest, that's okay!"

"No. No. I'm fine." I couldn't believe my eyes. This is Pokémon mystery dungeon! I played this long ago. It's hilarious that I was isekaied into an isekai game.
