The guild member arrived at Bob’s shop to deliver the news. Bob wasn’t aware of what was happening to the kingdom. Even if he dealt with adventurers daily, he wouldn’t talk to them about what was going on as he was more focused on his new shop. Current adventurers loved Bob’s blunt, direct nature. Bob wasn’t going to pull the wool over anyone’s eyes. That was a different Bob.

The Guild member looked through Bob’s store, eying all the particulars of his craft, before settling on a fine steel blade; holding it between her hands, she said,

“Quite an interesting sword that you have here? Work often with steel?”

“Of course. I have to for my project.”

“You bought the store from Mr. Dwarf so that you could make yourself a sniper rifle?”

“The only one in the world is broken.”

“And what if, just a hypothetical, someone else looted a treasure chest and obtained another one? Wouldn’t that be easier than what you’re doing?”

“I’d have to be lucky twice in one lifetime. I have better chances here.”

“Interesting.”

“What are you here for?”

“You haven’t heard?”

“I haven’t.”

“You hang out with adventurers all day. How have you not heard about the new necromancer.”

“I don’t talk to anyone. I make weapons.”

“Funny.”

“What do you mean?”

“Last time I talked to you, you seemed ready to confront your friends about your mistakes.”

“I didn’t say anything about that.”

“Even though it would make your life happier?”

“What makes me happy is helping my friends out.”

“Yes, but that’s not the whole story.”

“What’s it matter to you?”
