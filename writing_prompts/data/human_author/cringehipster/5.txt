“Are you still here?” The Necromancer asked.

“Yeah. I thought I heard you saying to come back?”

“I didn’t say that.”

The Necromancer’s expression was confused, then Bob turned around and took a step. A heavy sensation was dragging his foot toward the ground. 

“Is something wrong?” The Necromancer asked.

“Does it feel heavier when you walk over here?” Bob asked, and the Necromancer tested the floor, walking through the hallway before turning around.

“This is a waste of time. You have to head back.”

Why is the Necromancer wanting me to head back? Bob thought to himself. The Necromancer’s face was growing more distant, almost unrecognizable. Bob lifted his hand to look at it before the Necromancer grabbed his hand.

“What are you doing?” Bob asked.

“I’m dragging you out of here. You’re starting to go mad.”

Maybe he’s right. It’s been months since he’s stayed here with no sunlight. He needs to get back. Wait, months? Bob thought he wasn’t here for too long. As if it was yesterday when they waited. Has the concept of time vanished? No, it hasn’t been long.

“Your hand.”

Bob tried again to look at his hand, and the Necromancer shouted,

“What are you doing? Hurry up. I heard the Necromancer is in the kingdom.”

HE’S IN THE KINGDOM. NO. NOT THE CLERIC. NOT THE FIGHTER. NOT THE WIZARD. HE HAS TO RUSH BACK NOW. Bob had to get back.

At an Inn, the Wizard drinks mead, waiting for his friends. He overhears a conversation a few tables behind him.

“Why hasn’t the new guy attacked the kingdom yet?”

“There’s nothing about it. All I know is that he plans to attack the kingdom. He could strike at any time.”

“I’m not ready to fight.”

“Me neither. Why hasn’t the Adventurers Guild sent another party? Like last time.”

“They mysteriously broke up.”

That last line made the Wizard drink his mead. What do they know? Imagine adventuring with someone planning to kill you. It’s not easy adventuring with someone’s target on your back. The Cleric and the Fighter enter the bar, and the Wizard takes a deep breath. 

“It’s time to change this.” He muttered under his breath before waving his former teammates down. They sat with him, and the Wizard lifted his hand to the Bartender for another round. The Cleric was the first to start the conversation.

“Nice seeing you again. Even if there’s another tyrant on the loose.”

“I can say the same for you. How’s Paladin Society?”

“Wasn’t what I thought it would be.”

“I love it.” The Fighter chimed in. “Lots of quests.”

“You would follow me anywhere. It’s not about the quests.” The Cleric said.

“You’re right.”

“What brings you here to talk to us, Wiz?”

“I’ve been nostalgic recently.”

“No. Don’t say that.”

“Let’s hear him out. We made a pact long ago to talk it out.” The Fighter said. “We had good times, but do we want to go through with it again?”

“Yes.”

“Oh, brother.” The Cleric groaned.

“Bob made us better. To be honest, we were a bunch of assholes back then.”

“Just because we were rude back then doesn’t mean Bob had the right to plan on killing us.”

“He wouldn’t kill us.”

“What makes you say that? Is the Adventurers Guild paying you to say this?”

“I looked back in my donor records. He tried to have a pseudonym, but it was obvious. So Bob took the reward and gave us the lives were living now.”

“He donates money, and he’s instantly forgiven?” The Fighter asked.

“I’m not saying that. I am trying to get you guys to be more open-minded. Don’t be like me back then.”

The group remembered the early days of the journey when the Wizard started yelling at the group after a battle.

“That’s not how you fight!” The Wizard shouted at the Fighter. “What are you? Stupid?”

“Shut up. You’re fragile. Your bones would break under my mace.”

“You don’t know anything, do you? You fight like an idiot. You swing that thing like you’re a child. This isn’t a game.” The Cleric tried to calm the Fighter, but it was too late. A swift jab landed on the Wizard’s nose, and he was on the ground.

“Try your phony spells now.” The Fighter said before kicking the Wizard’s side and leaving. The Cleric’s face turns into a grimace, letting the Wizard know she has nothing to say to him before leaving. The only one who was willing to help the Wizard out was Bob. Bob looked at the Wizard’s nose and said,

“Yeah. I think the Cleric can heal that. I’ll make sure she does that.”

“Why?”

“Because you need a nose to breathe.”

“No. I mean… Why did I deserve that?”

“Well, why do you think they would have done that?”

“Because I was right?”

“You’re the smartest one here, but you don’t know a thing do you?”

“Hey, that’s rude.”

“Yeah, I said that without tact.”

“I had tact.”

“Did you? Did you wait till sometime after the battle for people to reflect?”

“He had to know now.”

“Why?”

“Because a battle could have happened anytime after.”

“Perhaps. But what if a battle happens now?”

“What do you mean?”

“You’re now suffering from a broken nose. What if a battle happens now?”

“I would ask the Cleric to heal me.”

“Alright. Imagine if you asked the Fighter if you could give your input. Would you have to waste the Cleric’s time to fix your broken nose?”

“This is stupid. I’m not going to ask people if I could give them my opinion. They have to know.”

“Alright,” Bob said and then got up to leave. The Wizard stewed for the rest of his night, and the throbbing pain from his nose didn’t help him sleep. If I was more careful? Would I be able to sleep? The Wizard thought as he tried to sleep. He couldn’t, as the pain kept him awake. He was used to sleeping on his stomach, his face in his pillow. Now he had to sleep on his back. Eventually, his lack of sleep got to him, and he left his tent to ask the Cleric for help.

“Hey. Hey! Please help me.” The Wizard pleaded before a wooden staff came hurling out of the tent, hitting his forehead. “Sorry.”

The following day, the group woke up early to have breakfast. The Fighter was cooking, the Cleric was polishing her staff, and the Wizard tried making conversation. No one spoke to the Wizard. A sinking feeling was in the Wizard’s stomach. He felt alone; even as people were around him, he felt the pain of being alone till Bob cured it. 

“Alright, everyone. Let’s head out.” Bob said as he tossed the sniper rifle on his back. “Oh, Cleric.”

“Yes?”

“Let’s get his nose fixed.” 

The Cleric rolled her eyes. However, she followed Bob’s orders.

“I have something to say.” The Wizard said. Everyone’s attention was on him. “I’m sorry. I’m an asshole. I don’t want to be that way ever again. I overstepped my boundaries. It’s not my place to tell people what to do.”

After he said his apology, the Fighter walked to his side and threw his arm around his shoulders. “Sorry, mate. It wasn’t right for me to lose my temper back there.”

In the aftermath of the next battle, the Wizard started asking questions to the Cleric.

“How do you do your healing spells? I suck at them.”

The Cleric always loved attention, even from people she wasn’t fond of.
