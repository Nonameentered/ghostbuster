I thank my nerdy self for reading all the Pokédex entries. Long ago, I only had a copy of sapphire and fire red. I have beaten it a hundred times, so I decided to read up about all the Pokémon on a long road trip. A section of my brain was dedicated to trivia about Pokémon. Unfortunately, it wasn't helpful till now. 

It turns out that Pokémon are dangerous. I'm sure every ten-year-old on planet earth has died. So let's go over all 5 of the deadliest Pokémon, shall we?

Number 5: Pikachu. The number of people trying to cuddle an electric mouse capable of stopping your heart is embarrassing.

Number 4: Spearow. I used to get angry at wasps for not leaving me alone, but imagine a larger version and easier to piss off.

Number 3: Jigglypuff. Let a Jigglypuff loose in the streets; car accidents are everywhere. The sales of Melatonin went down, though!

Number 2: Weedle. It's mandatory to shake your bedsheets at night in fear of a Weedle sneaking a poison sting in the middle of your slumber. You'll also have to check your shoes too.

Number 1: Charizard. There are two kinds of people. People who don't know that the flame on Charizard's tail can kill it if it goes out and the other people don't carry a squirt bottle. So don't be like those people.

The worst thing about all this is that there are no Pokéballs to contain them. Scientists cannot figure out how to make them from acorns. In response, I'm writing a survival guide on what to do when you come across X or Y Pokémon. See what I did there? Hahaha. I hate my life.
