"This reminds me of when he made me reconsider a few things," the Cleric said.

The night before the big battle, Bob threw away his bullets before returning to the campfire to warm up. The Cleric's unable to sleep, and she asks Bob a question on her mind.

"What's your plan after this?"

"What do you mean?"

What are you going to do after we defeat the Necromancer?

After tossing the bullets, it's as if fate asked him, what's next? What was he to do after? He's in the moment, not caring about what's happening next. He didn't have an answer, so he smiled at her and said, "I hope to journey more with you all." 

"Then you have to apply to Paladin Society with me."

"OOoo. Oh." Bob winced.

"What's with that?"


"They are too rich for my blood. A bit too elitist."

"Nonsense. That's a common misconception. Besides, once we take down the Necromancer, we'll be famous! We don't have to listen to them." The Cleric said that line as she told her side of the story.

"We'll be famous? Ouch. Wow, we ended up in the opposite direction." The Fighter said. 

"Not really. Everyone is better off. Even Bob has his own shop." The Cleric said.

"I tried to avoid Bob's shop. Didn't want to face him after what he did." The Fighter said.

"That's why I sent people to go in our stead."

"Wait, you mean… he's made our weapons?"

"Look at your mace."

The Fighter whips his mace out and runs his fingers over it. "This… this is incredible craftsmanship. I wondered why it was so light."

"Bob was always with us." The Wizard said. "He took the reward money and gave it all to us. Keeping only 100k to set up shop. I want to join him. In the Cave of Eons. I don't know what he is doing, but I'm sure he's got a plan to take out the new Necromancer."

"I'm in." The Cleric said.

"I'm not." The Fighter said.

"Oh? You're not joining me, Hubby?"

"I'm not in until you hear me out."

"What?"

"You guys get to have memories about Bob and how he made you better as a person."

"That does remind me. Why did Bob pick you?" The Wizard asked.

Before the journey, Bob's sitting at the bar. Drinking his sorrows away, and the Fighter walked up to him and said,

"Hey Buddy, do me a favor. I just want one more drink, and I'll pay you back.

The next day.

"Hey buddy, you don't know me, but I just arrived in town, and I'm short on money. Can you buy me a drink?

The day after.

"Drink?"

A week later.

"He bud Drink your please."

The memories ran through the Fighter's head, and he realized how awful of a friend he was. "On second thought, never mind." His hand picks up his drink, and he notices it's mead. "Can I get a water here?"
