No one arrived. A tear shed down Bob's cheeks as he got up into a sitting position. All was quiet, and the Necromancer wasn't in sight, which was interesting. Bob had no answers on what happened after the Necromancer took control of his body. There wasn't a smoking gun as the broken sniper rifle was placed pitifully on the ground. Bob picked up his weapon, noticing the damage. He could tell that the Figher crushed it to the point that it wasn't fixable.

Bob couldn't stay here. He needed to leave and find answers. So he stalked the area, wondering where everyone was. He got what he originally wanted; he was alone and couldn't take it. Leaving, he traveled back to the kingdom to find any sign of his friends, hoping they would hear him out. When he returns to the Adventurer's guild, he finds out the reward wasn't taken.

"Were you able to kill the Necromancer?" The guild member asked.

Silence. 

"I'm not sure."

In the next few weeks, Bob started to track the heroes, trying to find their whereabouts. Finally, on the fourth day, he was able to find the Wizard. Bob waved at him desperately, and the Wizard noticed him. Turning his face away from Bob and walked in the other direction. Bob couldn't find the Wizard again.

On the Sixth day, he found the Cleric and Fighter. Unfortunately, they were in the arms of two different parties and refusing to read any letters sent by Bob, but Bob refused to give up, hatching another scheme to talk to someone. The Cleric's relationship is rocky with the Fighter, so Bob starts to take advantage of that, writing a letter to the Fighter.

Dear Fighter,

I know that we didn't get to become closer back at Bob's party, but can we meet up for one final time?

Sent, 

The Cleric.

And another letter was written to the Cleric,

Dear Cleric,

Due to your impressive skills, we want to give you an offer from the Paladin Society.

Signed, 

Paladin John.

Bob included the address for where he would surprise both of them. The two adventurers took the bait, arriving in time for Bob to show up. As Bob revealed himself, their faces turned to worry.

"I should have known you would manipulate us into seeing you." The Cleric said.

"I'm beyond pissed. What were you thinking?" The Fighter asked.

"I want to tell you the whole story and ask what happened back there," Bob told them how he lost trust after being left for dead by his previous crew and that he picked new members due to spite, but he was irrational and grew to hate people. As he elaborated, the Cleric and Fighter's expressions became more detached. Even telling them what happened with the Necromancer didn't make a difference. As a result, Bob has lost all trust from his friends.

"The thing is, I won't ever begin to trust you ever again. There will always be a scope on my back from you." The Fighter said. With that, they begin to leave, but Bob interrupts them.

"Please. I don't care about the reward, but why didn't you collect it?"

"We don't know what happened after we killed you. The Necromancer wasn't around." The Cleric said.

"Is there any way you guys could forgive me?"

"No. You're a manipulative bastard. You tried to get us to come here right after you attempted to kill usâ€¦ twice. You were always the planning type. Whose to say that you would attempt to do it again?"

A couple of hours later, Bob was in an Inn, lying in bed. He replayed all of his memories from the past events over and over. The Necromancer was correct, his friends would leave him, and It was all his fault. Or was it? Bob returned to his old ways, blaming people for how he ended up. But it didn't last long, as the slightest reminder of his time with his old friends would let him know he was the bad guy. 

Bob was guilty. There was no excuse for what he's done. He repeated the actions of the party that betrayed him. Bob did the only thing he could do to redeem himself. He went back to distancing himself from people, a final parting gift to his friends, and a painful act of integrity from when he said to the Necromancer of only giving, not taking.

Bob was going to give his friends the thing he wanted all along, leaving his friends alone.

Part 7 is coming soon.
