This year’s Magical Girl Con has dozens of special guests, and the weebs throw a fit. The company that sponsors Magical Girl Con, ArchTech, has opened the entry barriers for becoming a Magical Girl. The new rules state that you're qualified if you’re not a wealthy superhero! Since Magical Girl Con allows characters from across multiple dimensions to visit, popular heroes are here to chat with fans.

Spider-man is hosting a talk about what it’s like being poor and having to fight crime. At the same time, Deadpool’s arguing with Green Lantern on whether or not he’s even considered a superhero. There’s chaos in the heroes’ home worlds, Shazam is filming his new movie, and his only helper is Superman. The rest of the Justice League is distracted. The Avengers appeared, and it looked like the Hulk was about to be nominated for being the prettiest Magical Girl.

Tony Starks at the convention since he’s dead and no longer needs to appear in movies. Wonder Woman’s frustrated at the lack of women here, but that’s a typical convention for you. Everyone’s taking advantage of ArchTech’s loose rules to sell products. Spider-Man is selling his photos, and Batman sold all of his belongings at the fair because, to everyone’s surprise, he wanted to be a Magical Girl all along.
