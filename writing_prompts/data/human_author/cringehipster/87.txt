“I need you to go over there and gather info on who caused the fire.”

“Yes, sir,” I said as the background music changed to ambient music. Downstairs, I grab my badge and gun. Outside, I find the first poor sap with the nicest-looking car. A cherry red automobile passes me, and I sprint to the window. The car stops, and the guy looks at me with fury. I flash my badge and say, “Sorry, but this is police business. I have to have your vehicle.”

He gets out, and I slide in. It’s roomy, and the interior is leather. My hands rub the wheel. It feels warm from the summer heat. Then I floor it, knocking the owner over. I glance at the rearview mirror. He’s shouting at me, and I can vaguely hear, “Wait till your boss hears about this! Dumb@#$%!” When he’s done, he walks into a building, and I never see him again.

If I were a real-life detective, I would be on the news for multiple homicides and grand theft auto. But, alas, I’m a video game detective. An old detective game that I don’t remember the name of. I am having a blast, regardless. I solve the same thirty-something cases, get into gunfights, and steal cars. I have collected every car here. This cherry red automobile is called Claret, one of the rarest cars in the game.

Until I got into an accident, I got T-boned for running a red light, which would be my fault in the real world. Not here, though. I am the king of this world. I got out of Claret, and the guy who T-boned me got out of his car. He tried to raise a finger at me, so I pulled out my magnum. He backed away quickly. 

The game wasn’t programmed to have ‘concerned’ citizens reporting me. Occasionally, I have a partner with me. He or she will complain about my manners, but as programmed, they will forget about it. Life is easy, even with the hardest difficulty. I spend most of my time looking for game breaking glitches.
