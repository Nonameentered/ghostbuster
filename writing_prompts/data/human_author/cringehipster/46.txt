I thought people would learn after Covid that workers need to be paid more. Yet, here I am in the middle of 2030 as a grubhub driver. I also ubereats as well. Neither pay hazard pay!

Some routes are not worth it. Take today as an example. Generally, you want to tip a dollar for every two miles. Not this guy. No, he tipped me one dollar. I had to travel 14 miles. I took it anyways, hoping he would tip me cash included. 

I had to take the highway, which made my route slower because dozens of zombies are waiting for someone to wreck there. Pity the soul who loses gas there, I make sure to up my tank before taking the highway. Sometimes I hope for a cute guy or girl to wreck there so I can rescue them. It's quite lonely this year.

After taking the closet exit that Waze will allow me to take, I gun it to the guy's house. I'm running late, but only by a few minutes. I ring the doorbell, and I hear a some thuds on the other side.

My mind is fantazing again. What if it's a cute guy with a jawline? Or maybe it's a kind stranger who will tip me in cash. Man, my life sucks if these dreams are what I want in life. Unfortunately, the door swung open and my eyes didn't like what they were seeing.

A redneck with a handgun, undersized shirt, and wearing boxers. He eyed me with the dumbfounded customer look that hit me millions of times. Then he started,

"You're late." I attempted to hand him the pizza, but he rudely snatched it out of my hands. He opens the box, sifting through it as if I had personally made the pizza myself then slammed the door.

You know what happens next. Anyone who works in retail deals with it. My phone dinged when I got to the car. A one star review for me. I could taste the anger in my tounge. I got out of my car and knocked loudly. He opens it, the same look that pisses me off. I yell at him,

"You know that's my money right there!?"

"The pizza sucks."

"I didn't make the pizza."

"So?"

"So? I drove 14 miles for you and you refunded my tip."

Slam. The prick closed the door, nearly hitting my nose. I got back into my car, bawling. It was humiliating. My ride home was depressing. Till a zombie smacks my window.

I slowed down to let the zombie follow me. Meals on wheels I thought. I arrived back at the man's house, zombie in tow. I lept out of my vehicle and grabbed a rock out of his driveway. I got back in time and got as close to the house as I possibly could. Then I hit my hand on the steering wheel.

Honk!

The door opens and the zombie sees the easier target. 

I roll down my window, launch the rock at this forehead. He tried grabbing the gun but it's too late. I played baseball.
