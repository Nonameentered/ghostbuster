The Galactic Community couldn't resist the efficiency of science. Back then, lengthy rituals were performed to transport ambassadors across worlds. In your world, you can say, "Beam me up, Scotty!" And then you'll be transported with atoms. In ours, you'll say, "Beam me up Scotty," and after weeks of gathering materials for conjuration magic, you'll be able to reach your destination.

This revolutionized the Galaxy. Members of the Galactic Community overlooked the practitioner, applauding his success. He was given a seat on the Council, this being the first instance of someone breaking the rules of the GC, and getting rewarded for it. This didn't stop his plans to continue rebelling with his controversial ideas.

The Galactic Community was dependent on Magic to solve problems. It would seem that using miracles to fix society would be reasonable, but you need Mana to power magic. Mana is a renewable resource, however, it takes years to replenish, which the GC wasn't able to wait that long. Instead, our practitioner had to look at other ideas to maintain society. He stated that if we were to rely more on science to solve minor issues, we can save Mana for the bigger things in life.
