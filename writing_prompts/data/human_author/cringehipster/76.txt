It's been two months, and he still found a way to evade me. Fortunately, I always wanted to live alone, BUT I can't afford it! I shouldn't have cut him slack, and I felt sorry that he had lost his job. Now he's hard to track down, and my no-good landlord isn't helping either.

"Sucks for you. I need rent."

What an impolite thing to say! He never once let me catch a break! Please don't assume that it's my fault that my roommate didn't pay his half. I never got to talk to him, so I am posting a new opening for a roommate. And I'll wait for anyone who seems normal. At least, that's what I thought! Till a weeb applied!

"Gomenasai!" The weeb greeted. For fucks sake. He talked in a low, raspy voice as if that was badass. It's embarrassing. I tried telling him, "No! ABSOLUTELY NOT!" Then the money came across my sight. Enough to pay the rent for the rest of the lease. 

"Why?" I ask him.

"Because I am looking for Shaun." 

"My roommate?"

"Yes!"

"Well, good luck. He hasn't been here except to sleep and eat my food."

"I will handle him." The weeb flashes his sheath on his hip.

The stuff I have to put up with for money!
