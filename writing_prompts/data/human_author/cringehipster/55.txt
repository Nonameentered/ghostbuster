The thing about the white room is that there are no shadows to entertain you. I've done this before, and only I could have walked outside at any time back then. I know there are shadows out there, observing us. The world out there is more significant than what's in here. The guards who are monitoring me are not aware of my past history.

Back then, I was born in a cave with a friend. I grew up there all my life. I thought the cave was the whole world, oblivious to the larger one. We were chained to the cave, watching shadows reflect on the wall. My friend and I thought that was all there was until a guard out there loosened the chain and let me free one night.

This guard was a generous soul who took pity on my forced ignorance. He let me go as my friend was asleep. I followed him outside, and he showed me a world I had struggled to comprehend for many years afterward. Before I could simmer in it, the other guards came back to check on me. I retreated inside to get my friend to go with me.

After the situation settled, I told my friend everything. He mocked me, and I was told that I'm a lunatic. I couldn't take that cave anymore, so I left without him to learn about the world. For the next decade, I traveled the world. This was how I ended up in the white room.

The room was perplexing, and the architecture wasn't like anything I had seen out there. The walls were smooth and bright. I couldn't handle how blinding the room was for the first few days. Memories of being chained to the cave did not compare to this. The cave had entertainment through the shadows. Here, I have to rely on my thoughts. Back then, I could get tired from watching the shadows, so I would close my eyes and imagine myself living like the shadow's lives.

The plan was to repeat the same events that happened back then. I know there are outside forces at present; they must be observing me. I was their shadow or, more like, their entertainment. I must get them to close their eyes out of boredom. The equivalent of them closing their eyes is to let me free. I closed my eyes and imagined that I was a gladiator.

The fantasy kept me occupied over the next few weeks. The battle of boredom wasn't against my audience. It was with myself. I ran out of material to keep myself mentally active. The same stories had similar climaxes and endings. If only I had a pen to write them down. I had to come up with something different, and this was when I wondered what my friend was doing now. This was what kept me motivated for the rest of my stay.

I imagined him leaving the cave. It's years after I went and he wants to find me. He asks around the towns and follows my trail. I hoped he would take the time to bask in the sights we missed from being in the cave long ago. Finally, he traverses to the open field where I was kidnapped long ago and then meets the same people who took me.

At the end of my train of thought, I heard a door open. My neck jerks to the front of the room. Waiting for me at the door, is my friend, and he says,

"Thank you for telling me. You tried to tell me, and I didn't listen. So now I'm repaying the favor."

Another room has a control room packed with monitors to observe the two friends. A mysterious man sits on a chair, watching what is unfolding. On a separate monitor nearby, the man's fantasies are playing on it, right up to the point where his friend rescues him. The mysterious man has a paper about manifestation, believing he's found the expert.
