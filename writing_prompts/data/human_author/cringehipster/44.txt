“Now, starting the discussion for Dr. Whilms to move on to the afterlife. Prompted by Dr. Charles.” The hospital administrator announced inside the conference room. She’s in front of several established doctors deciding the fate of the late Dr. Whilms. Dr. Whilms possesses several patients to tell doctors the diagnosis. It started as unsettling, but the administrator didn’t budge when she heard the news. Instead, she capitalized on the opportunity and took advantage of Dr. Whilm.

Dr. Whilm’s old friend, Charles, sits across the mahogany table. If you were there, you could tell he’s not content with being the defender in this pseudo-courtroom scenario. He didn’t study law. He studied medicine in hopes that he doesn’t have to argue with people. But, unfortunately, Charles didn’t think about arguing with his administrator.

“If I may start, Dr. Charissa.”

“You may.”

“It is my firm belief that Dr. Whilms should be able to move onto the afterlife. He’s done enough for this hospital, and now he needs rest.” Another doctor chimes in,

“He’s a ghost. Researching him would be necessary for the field of science. We can find out more about how people died.” Another doctor agrees with him,

“Exactly. Having a doctor from beyond helping us is a valuable asset.”

“That’s why keeping him on the board is important.” The Admin said.

“You guys are inconsiderate! How do we know if he’s not in pain?” Charles said.

“How would you know that?”

“I wouldn’t. But if I wanted to quit, I would be legally be able to quit. A ghost should be able to quit.”

“Well, the rules are written for humans. Not for ghosts.” The Admin snapped. This was enough for the unique guest they invited to this session. Connor, the bored local medium, starts by saying,

“Alright. I don’t know anything about being a doctor. The only thing I know about the body is how to show it a good time-”

“Professionalism, Connor.”

“Hey, it’s Lord Connor, Dr. Charissa.”

“I’m not calling you Lord because you have a brochure printed off the web.”

“It’s a piece of paper, a certification like yours. If you want me to call you Dr. Charissa, then you must be able to call me Lord Connor.”

“Fine. Lord Connor. What is it that you think we should do?”

“We need to speak to Dr. Whilms.”

“Through what?”

“A Ouija board.”

“You’re insane? This has no relation to science!” One of the doctors from earlier protested.

“Do ghosts have any scientific background?”

“Dr. Whilms does,” Charles said.

“If anything, if I can’t communicate with him, then just don’t pay me. The only thing wasted is time.” The board talks for a moment and comes to a consensus. It’s a yes.

Connor begins to prepare the room with the Admin and Dr. Charles. He darkens the conference room, setting several herbs across the room. Charles couldn’t help his curiosity. He picked up one of the herbs, sniffed it, and then asked Charles,

“Hey, didn’t I prescribe you a medical license earlier this year?”

“Yeah. But that’s not important. It’s ready now.”

They examine the board; both the Admin and Charles have their hands on it. “Go ahead, ask him your questions.” Charles jumps the gun,

“Hey, Bud!”

H. E. Y.

“Holy shit, it works.”

H.A. H. A. Ha.

“Is it painful to be a ghost?”

N.

“Do you like helping people?” The Admin asked.

Y.

“That’s enough for me.” The Admin said.

“No, wait.”

“That’s all we need to know.”

“No, it isn’t. Hey buddy, is there anything that we can do for you?”
