That's the thing about dreams. They evolve into nightmares. 

Case Study #39875

The man who can control his hallucinations. 

The subject was a Psychonaut. A Psychonaut is a person who studies altered states of consciousness through the use of meditation, dreaming, or drugs. The subject used all three methods to induce hallucinations and learned to control them. After examining the brain, we can replay the memories of his hallucinations through his machine.

Day 1:

The subject experiments with his newfound abilities in a conjured simulation in an unnamed city. He takes flight, soaring through the city for the first day. This first scenario lasted for twenty-four hours. The subject didn't move a muscle for the whole day.

Day 2:

The subject tests his abilities again, and he can conjure objects in his world. These include fire, cars, people, and environments. The subject is creating worlds of his own for enjoyment. The subject left the simulation one time to eat for ten minutes. He had a meal shake, and we can determine this from his apartment. It was his last meal. 

Day 3:

The subject has created a reality to live in. This reality is where he plays the role of a charming secret agent, similar to Ian Flemming's novels. This reality is one that the subject decided to immerse himself in for the rest of the case study.

Day 4:

The subject is capable of wiping his memories. In an attempt to wipe out traumatic memories, the subject mistakenly wiped all of his memories, except those that take place in his new realm. The subject's mind rebooted, aligning itself with the new realm. The body was tricked into tracking his new life, unable to maintain it's physical self. The subject began to feel hungry and ate frequently, confused by his starvation.
