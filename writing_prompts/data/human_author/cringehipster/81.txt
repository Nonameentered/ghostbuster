How right I was, morning rolled on over, and all the fairies woke up to have breakfast. I served 4 ounces of coffee to each of them. Their tiny bodies couldn't handle a human cup. It'd be like three expressos, and that's too much caffeine. I waited until the afternoon, and soon all the fairies buzzed around excitedly. It was as if I was in a playground. I couldn't help smiling as I saw them play. Oberon sent me to the right place.

Oberon is the King of the Fairies. He tasked me with discovering what was going on with his kingdoms. One of the head fairies, Titania, sauntered over to me. She asked, "Thank you! How did you know how to wake us?" 

"Well, I figured that you guys haven't tried coffee. So I thought it would be hilarious to see fairies over-caffeinated." Titania smiled at me. She must have liked my mischievous nature. Then I asked her, "Who did this?"

"The Sandmen." She said. I was familiar with the story. I grabbed my tool bag and held her chin between my fingers. I pulled out a magnifying glass and looked at her face. "What are you doing?" 

"Looking for sand in your eyes." Her eyes were crusty with sand. The sandmen were here.
