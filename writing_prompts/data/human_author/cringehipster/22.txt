I've attempted to leave the state, but it was too late. By the time Ohio will be eliminated by whatever enigma is going to take place, and I'll still be in line for Indiana. If I walked, it'd be more than 24 hours to make it across. There's no making it out of here.

I sat on some nearby stairsteps. There was something about this, that I took for granted, and I've only begun to notice this moments before having to kiss my ass goodbye. It's real nice to have a seat once in a while. My eyes rested on a messenger of this calamity, the electric signs that state, "Ohio will be eliminated." Ohio. It was as if the word was glowing at me. Telling me what's next.

It's a stupid idea, but it's better than hitting the road for Indiana. I reassured myself that it's not a stupid idea. It's my only choice in this bizzare situation. The town hall was near enough for me to walk to. Inside is a group of people huddled for the inevitability of their doom. I kicked open the doors and for once felt like a hero. I wasn't a savior however, I was doing this to save my butt for future sitting. 

Heads turned to my direction, their faces are confused, depressed, or desperate. My eyes scanned the room, looking for anyone with prestige. The mayor looked at me, he wore a face of depair, and this prompted me to grab his shoulders and yell,

"We need to rename our state!" His face turned from despair to cluelessness.

"What are you talking about?"

"It says Ohio will be eliminated. We can change the name, that way Ohio can be eliminated without danger." I finished my point and it wasn't long until I was tossed out of the town hall next to the library. My idea wasn't considered realistic, to which I retort that this whole hysteria was surreal. Then the sky turned on me, giant lettering in the sky said,

"Ohio will be eliminated in 5 minutes."

I yelled at the town hall, telling them, "Good luck assholes!" Afterwards, I sprinted into the library, and headed to the roof, three minutes were left. I was proud of my adrenaline filled athletic ability, even though I'm left gasping for air. Then I pulled out my phone, pulled up a wikihow article, and declared with my fist raised in the sky,

"THIS IS THE COUNTRY OF CRINGEHIPSTER. IT HAS A PERMANENT POPULATION OF 1 WITH A GOVERNMENT. I'M THE KING AND I'M CAPABLE OF INTERACTING WITH OTHER STATES. MY BORDER IS THIS LIBRARY ITSELF."

Exhausted, I fall backwards and lay on my back. Time is up and a blinding light surrounds me. Perhaps, my idea didn't work and I let the light warm my imminent death. Even though my country wasn't a serious endeavor, I died a king.

Or so I thought. 

Five minutes passed and I open my eyes to the library standing tall. My hands reach for my chest. I'm still here. Then the door to the library's roof opens and a lady rushes toward me.

"I heard you shouting. You saved us." More people followed behind, eager to see what happened to the former state.
