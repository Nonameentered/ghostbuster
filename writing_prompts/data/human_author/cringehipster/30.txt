“Will you quit raising skeletons!”

“Why? It’s the same as your raising spell.”

“I’ll have you know that my raise spell works on knocked out people only.”

“It does not.”

“Are you crazy? I revived you last week.”

“I was dead dead. I chilled with the gods, and newsflash, it’s not those gods that gave you your cleric powers. You revived me just before I could try to score with them! You’re just a white robed Necromancer.”

“I have morals and codes that a cleric lives by, it’s nothing like necromancy.”

“What good does that do when I’ve been ruining the sanctity of life my whole life and still got to unwind with the big men themselves. Well big men and big women gods.”

“The gods you hang out with are probably war gods or something of -”

“Actually, it’s all artsy gods. Like the god of love and there’s a god of parties, oh and a god of booze, god of mead, and -”

“Wow. Hedonistic gods whose personality is centered on booze…”

“Yeah. Maybe, you know, existence should be enjoyed. A pretty lady such as yourself shouldn’t be worried about the afterlife. You got so many years-”

“Hello? I’m not doing it for a spot in the afterlife. I’m doing it to help others.”

“Well, why don’t you help me out huh?”

“I can’t believe you said that.”

“Come on. Have you ever been with a guy? Or did you take that vow of chastity?”

“I didn’t.”

“Oooooh. Really?”

“I didn’t take any vows.”

“Then let’s go out for a drink sometime.”

“You’re not winning me over with a drink.”

“I’m not planning to.”

“Then what are you scheming then.”

“Woah. Woah. Pretty rude of you to stereotype me for being a Necromancer. We’re not all evil masterminds here.”

“You’re definitely not a mastermind.”

“You sure? I think I got you open to hanging out with me.”

“Did I even say I will go out with you?”

“No, but wouldn’t it be nice to get to know each other more?”

Over in a tavern nearby, a rogue reunites with his party by pulling off his invisibility cloak. A captivated Barbarian and Wizard is waiting to hear news from the rouge, the Barbarian starts,

“So have you found out anything.”

“They are going to go out for drinks tonight.”

“God damn it.” The Wizard shouted.

“Looks like your high INT didn’t foresee this.” The Barbarian said and held out his hand. The Wizard shoots him a glare and she pulls out some money from her pouch and slaps it into the greedy warriors palms. The Barbarian and Wizard leave for the night, while the rogue stays behind with the Innkeeper. The keeper notices the smirk on the rogue’s face and questions,

“What’s got you so giddy today?”

“Everyone is hooking up with each other.”

“That must be good for your bets. The Barbarian and Wizard, and the Necromancer and Cleric. What’s your next prediction.”

“Innkeeper and Weaponsmith.”

“You’re not saying that I’m going to hook up with Alieah now, are you?”

“Here let me pour you a shot and tell you why.”

The innkeeper grabs a bottle and hands it to the rogue. The rogue holds a glass in his hand, his face is that of a showman’s. The glass slowly fills with liquid, while the bottle is draining from the thief’s hand. The Innkeeper is baffled to see this,

“How are you doing that without lifting the bottle?”

“I'll teach you sometime. Here.” The rogue slides the glass over.

“Thank the gods, I needed a drink since I lost the last bet.” He takes a swig and then asks, “so, how are you guessing that I will end up with Alieah?”

“You always had a thing for her back when I was the innkeeper.”

“I did not.”

“Oh yeah? When she’s with a different guy every few months, you’re in here drinking your sorrows away.”

“That’s still not going to make me waltz over to her and confess my feelings.”

“No. You just need a little help from my friend.”

“What are you saying?”

“You know how we all sort of thought that the Barbarian and Wizard was a thing?”

“You did. We all lost on that one.”

“Oh that’s right. Then I said it’s the Necromancer and the Cleric next. We got into that one, except the wizard.”

“Yes. Yes. I get it you’re psychic.”

“Oh no. I’m not psychic.”

“What do you mean?”

“There’s something I did to everyone before they hooked up.” The innkeeper’s face begins to redden and he looks at his hand.

“What, what am I feeling?”

“I made a stop at the alchemist today. It was easy profit, I already had the materials for him to make it.”

“What! What did you make?”

“A love potion.”
