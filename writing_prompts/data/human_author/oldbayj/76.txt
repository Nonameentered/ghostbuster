Hello. This is an interesting concept. A really like the idea of a journal discovered, left by his mother. I am a little confused. Is this his journal from the future? Or his kids'? I feel like that section isn't quite clear enough and there isn't enough detail to make it believable. Just a few extra sentences could really hope drive that moment home, give it an emotional punch. 

I also notice in a few places you use quotations for thoughts. Those should be reserved for actual dialogue. You can just leave it open or use italics to indicate internal thoughts. 

Overall, nice take on theme.
