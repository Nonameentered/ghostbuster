Hey there. 

There's a very interesting foundation for a story here, but I think we need more. Lots of questions are introduced here, not all of which are answered by the end. I like the theme incorporated here and you do a great job of instilling a sense of dread and fear. And it works well here! If you're inspired to do so, maybe flesh it out a bit and see where it takes you. I think some additional linebreaks would help here, as well, and in certain places could really intensify the feeling. I find short, choppy sentences do this very well, especially when placed on their own line.

Thanks for sharing your story!
