###A Cold Day in Hell
**PART 1/2**

***
It was time to go back—back to where it all began. 

I stood in the doorway of the house I once called home. But it was no longer a home, not mine. With its splintered wood, crumbling frame, and mold-laden walls and floorboards, it was just a house. The bones of an old life.

The odor hit me first. It drifted through the air like a late-summer breeze, reeking of every bad thing that had ever happened within these walls. It smelled of death and despair, putrid and suffocating. Nausea warmed my throat as I stepped further into the house. 

Conflicting emotions knotted inside me, twisting and turning, twisting and turning. Over and over. I struggled to remain upright and focused in their presence.

Memories of my wife, Addison, and the life we built together. The way she’d dance around the kitchen, when she thought no one was watching. The way her silky, auburn hair would caress her shoulders. The darkness that fell over her—over all of us—so suddenly.

Backyard camping. Clarinets and trumpets blaring down the stairs as Henry and Lilah practiced. Lilah’s voice carrying from the front stoop as she sang. Both of them running up and down the hallways, giggling. 
“You can’t catch me, Daddy,” Henry’s tiny voice echoed in my mind as I leaned against the wall. 

And then the silence. I wouldn’t go back there, no. 

I pulled myself together. I pushed forward, despite the pinching behind my eyes and overflowing tears that streamed down my face. The house was still, quiet, and yet, the sound was almost deafening. 

Photographs of happy days still hung from the walls, layers of dust blurring our rehearsed smiles. I continued on through the house, down the hallway, in the kitchen, into each of the bedrooms. I peeked in each, as if on instinct. As if I’d find them there, resting or playing. As if this whole thing had been one awful nightmare. 

But all that remained were there things. Our lives were frozen in time within the walls of this house. I felt like my life stopped when I lost Addison and the kids. Like I’d been trapped in some sort of limbo, waiting for something to happen. But I didn’t know what. Or, sometimes, if I even wanted to find my way out.

Exiting Henry’s bedroom, I circled back down the hallway and turned right, towards the basement. The door’s paint had long since peeled away. Even the strip that was once filled with sketched lines to mark the children’s growth over the years had faded and gone. Another memory lost to the passage of time, ruined by the Thing beyond the basement door. 

I stood frozen in front of the closed door, enveloped by the aroma of damp earth. Overgrown shrubbery and vines protruded from all sides of the doorframe, reaching out for me. They shook in my presence. Reminding me of their power. 

Trembling, I reached for the knob, ready to yank it from its frame of tangled growth. But before I could pull, the door released, and creaked open. 

My legs trembled. 

Quickened heartbeats thumped against my chest, urging me to turn back. 

And I could turn back, if I wanted to. I could run as far away as my feet would carry me and never look back. Drink myself into forgetting it all. The Thing had already taken everything that mattered from me. And claimed my home as its own. 

It left me as nothing more than a walking, talking, set of bones, waiting to die. *As I deserved.* I drifted back once again, to the before times. All the times I’d failed as a husband, a father. The plays I’d missed, the late nights at work. The tears Addison had cried because of me. 

*They might still be here if…*

“No!” I yelled down the stairs and into the darkness. I shook my head and took a deep breath. Those were not my thoughts, not all of them. The Thing was a master at reading people. Seeping into your mind and twisting your thoughts so you didn’t know reality from illusion. Tricking you into doing its bidding. 

But I wouldn’t fall for it. Not this time. It would be a cold day in Hell before I let that monster win.
