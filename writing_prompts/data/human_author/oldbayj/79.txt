Thank you so much for your detailed feedback, courage! I'm glad to know you liked it. It's definitely a cult ritual, but there's no psychedelics involved lol. No drugs of any kind. The colorful waves were just magic. But it's really interesting—and helpful—to see where the piece lost you a bit. Usually I'm decent at telling a story within the wordcount but I struggled to get this down to 500 and I fear a lot may have been lost. (Though, let me tell you, it was *waaaay* weirder in draft one!)  


Thanks again. I appreciated all your words.
