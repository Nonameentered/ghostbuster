After being ~~pushed into~~  encouraged to sign up for task, here I am. I'm going to really try to complete them...

**For March:**

* Write a romance (with romance actually being the main genre)
* Freewrite prompt response (This is going to be hard. I am a very slow, edit-while-writing writer)
* I recently bought these really wonderful Emotion & Trait Thesauruses (by Angela Ackerman & Becca Puglisi). I'd like to write at least two stories/scenes based on two of the entries (e.g. a pessimistic character, a character in denial, a charming one, etc)
* And for this last one, ~~per Arch's insistence encouragement in Campfire, I will write for 2 features (that I don't run)~~ I've decided that since all my other tasks are writing for things, I want to make this reading-related. I've been slacking on my reading so hard. So, I would like to read at least one book this month. Either *Final Girl Support Group* (Grady Hendrix) or *Where the Crawdads Sing* (Delia Owens).

Good luck to me, I'm terrified.
