**PART 2/2**

I descended the stairs, slowly, pausing on each creaking step. Heart racing against my labored breathing. 

Bubbling brown sludge greeted my feet at the bottom. It was thick, as deep as my ankles, and hot against my skin. Bile rose in my throat, but I forced it down. My knees knocked together. But I had to be strong; this was no time to succumb to my own body.

The Thing erupted from the sludge in the center of the room, red eyes glaring into me. Thick tentacle-like vines protruded from its oozing body, each covered in sharp thorns. Yellow fluid ejected from the ends of the vines, across the room. It burned as it landed on my arms and chest; searing pain shot through my body as my flesh sizzled. 

I screamed. The pain was immense. The creature started wobbling towards me, tentacled vines swinging. Colors blurred into one another, sounds became distorted. My thoughts melded with its own, leaving me a jumbled mess ready to collapse in the corner. Ready to give up and let it swallow me whole. 

The entire nightmare could be over, if I let it. A few more minutes of pain and then I’d be free. Maybe I’d even see Henry and Lilah again, feel Addion’s lips on mine as we danced in the moonlight… 

I couldn’t breathe. It was almost over. Just a little longer. 
Wait, no. This wasn’t… it wasn’t me. These thoughts were not my own. I forced them away. There was no world in which I was going to allow this beast to win. No world in which I’d allow another family to be ripped apart by its thorny embrace. 

I pulled the knife from its holster and started blindly stabbing. As hard as I could. Left, right, up and down. And forward. Again and again and again. 

I sliced off several of its limbs. They each released a gush of air as they hit the basement floor. I gouged the knife right into the Thing’s largest eye, that sat atop its forehead. Green liquid spurted out, right into my face. 

But I didn’t care. I kept stabbing. I released all of my anger, my pain, my grief. I had to destroy it. This abomination that never should have been able to exist. The monster shrieked and shook. The high-pitched shrieks sent chills through my body, rattling my very bones. 

With one last slice, I cut open the Thing’s throat. The feeling of victory was warm. I smiled as the blood ran down my hands and arms and dripped on the floor with the sludge, where the creature lay limp and deflated. 

Like an old, dead plant. 

I exhaled, finally. It was as if I'd been holding my breath since the day it all began. 

Soiled and fatigued, I made my way to the top of the stairs and collapsed onto the carpet. And I cried, hard. I couldn’t stop. Minutes turned to hours and I was still crying and heaving on the floor. 

Despite it all, I realized I didn’t feel any better. Sure, justice and all that. But Addison, Henry, and Lilah weren’t here with me. Not really. But the echo of their memories continued to eat at me on the inside. 

Whoever said that it hurt a little less each day, must have never lost anyone they truly loved. Because even now, years later, it still hurts just as much. A huge hole remains in my heart for them, a hole that can never be filled. 

But each day, I remind myself that it's just proof of how vast one person can love another. How deep a connection can go. And that is something that even the biggest and baddest of monsters can’t touch.
