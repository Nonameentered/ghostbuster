###On the Edge Grows a Vine
***

I know it’s wrong and there will be a price. But I have to do this—for her. Love has a way of doing that. Like a vine, it grows and grows, wrapping itself around every stem and tendril until you are but one. It’ll bring you to the edge and force you to make a choice. 

Jade is my vine. And that edge is the disease that’s consuming her. 

For months, I prayed to whatever would listen. One night, *It* came. The Thing. The Creature of the night. The three-eyed shape-shifter, reeking of death. And It came with a deal.

The night air is thick beneath the jet-black sky. The darkness seems to infect everything, leaving not even a sliver of moonlight to guide me. 

Sweat covers my body as I feel my way through the forest. The swaying branches are like pointed claws swiping at my skin. Suddenly the forest feels so big and me so small. As if I could walk a thousand miles and never reach the other side. 
	
Not by sunrise. 

Screeching. Howling. Groaning. It’s behind me. In front of me. Above me. It’s everywhere but nowhere. The sounds pierce my eardrums. 

Dead leaves drag along the ground. They swirl in circles around me. My hands glide along a trunk of peeling bark and I force my feet forward. 

The Creature cackles and whispers behind me. Shock-like shivers crawl down my spine and rest in my feet. My toes are on fire. I’m sure they’re now just burnt crisps of flesh sitting in my sneakers. I want to stop. 
	
*This is the end, it has to be. I can stop now. Surrender.* I shake my head. These thoughts aren’t mine.

*Jade, Jade, Jade.* I say it over and over; I remind myself why I’m here. Why I must reach the edge of the forest, and soon.

I don’t—I can’t remember her face. Are her eyes blue? Or brown? Fatigue washes over me. 

Three glowing eyes appear, closing in quickly. The shadows of the forest come into focus as dim pinks and blues slowly move overhead, filling the previously-black sky. 

I collapse onto the ground. “Noooo.” Tears wash down my face. So close, it’s right there.

It appears in front of me. A body of black fog. Its rancid breath stuns me as it licks the side of my face with a daggered tongue. I inch my fingers over the forest boundary. The Creature doesn’t notice. “I…win.” 

It cackles and growls. The black fog expands and multiplies like baby spiders exiting the sac. “I shall uphold our bargain. I’ll remove the disease from your wife’s body.”

A gurgle escapes my throat as I fight for the next breath. And that’s when I see it. The pale skin. The lesions on my arms. “No,” I protest. But it’s too late. The disease that ravaged Jade’s body for years had swallowed mine in one night.

She will never know—or forgive me—but at least my vine will continue to grow.
