###The Descent 

***

*You’re the key. Be the fire.* Mother’s voice echoes in my mind. I exhale, releasing a cloud of anxiety. I’m now calm, controlled, and collected. 

My legs tremble; I take my place beside the other girls at the altar. My cheek’s raw; my palms sting, sweat dripping into the crescent-shaped slits. 

“The ritual is necessary.” It’s another Chosen Girl. Her voice fades, swallowed by the buzzing mosquitoes and swamp surrounding us. 

Fire crackles on either side of the altar as each girl repeats the same line. The bright flames twist and turn. I wonder what it will be like to be fire. Having freedom to dance in the sky, expelling all the evil. 

*You can’t trust them. Their tongues spout lies.*

A cough catches my attention. Faces stare back at me and I feel transparent. 

“The, uh, ritual—” I choke. Eyes widen, gasps and whispers cut the air. I clear my throat. “—is necessary.” 

The Divine Sister nods as she chants, extending her arms. Her black eyes melt, dripping down her face like cracked eggs. 

I’ll show you and all of your evil-doers. The heat within me grows; it churns in my belly. 

Thunder rumbles. Lightning strikes the ground. I crumble to my knees, clutching my body. It strikes again and again. Six times. One for each Chosen Girl.

“Get up,” the Divine Sister yanks me to my feet with the others. 

*You’re the key.* Mother’s words again. *Be the fire.* Heat continues to grow within me. 

The other girls look ahead, their faces long and sullen. I wonder if they can be saved. Maybe evil hasn’t consumed them yet. I can feel Mother’s disapproving gaze and I shake off the lie.

The Divine Sister approaches the Circle of Sacrifice. Six bodies, six mothers; all who lived and loved. At what point had they fallen into darkness? 

A blade cuts the first mother’s flesh. Waves of blue, green, and yellow pour out into the dark night. Magic we’re all meant to consume. It sizzles like acid. 

*“That’s the sound of evil,”* Mother had said one night as we watched from the trees. Her eyes glowed red in its presence. 

Blood and magic seep out as each body is split open scalp to toe. My muscles pulse. A thick gray smoke fills the air. 

*Be the fire.* It’s all I can think, over and over. 

I kneel by Mother. Something isn’t right.

Burning. Flesh falls to the ground in burnt crisps as my arms become a raging inferno. Wings of fire burst through my back.

Screams. The swarming magic searches for a host. 

Mother rises from the Circle, her eyes glowing. With a guttural roar, she swallows the magic and explodes into flames. They’re black as death. 

“This whole time!” 

Mother’s flames mimic mine, pulsing to the beat of my emotions. 

The truth slices my insides like the claws of a beast. “You’re…the evil.” 

“It’s in your blood too, girl. You’re me. And I’m you.” 

*You’re the key. Be the fire.*
