Hey words. This was an interesting and intriguing piece. I like the world you've hinted at here, though I would like to see a bit more. So much that we don't know, things we don't have exact closure on (i.e. what did Alina do?)

I think there are a few places you could really ramp up the tension in this piece by using shortened sentences, with less explanation (I know, weird after what I just said above). For example:  

>She fell silent, like everyone else in the room had.

Here, I think "She fell silent." would be more impactful. End the line on that, so we as the reader can sit with that image just a moment. It gives us a second to feel the tension and wonder what's coming. 

Another example would be here:   
\---> "Run," she said, and they scrambled to obey

 I'd suggest putting a period after she said. Let us sit with that for just a tiny beat.

But overall this piece was interesting. I like the dark tone of it and am curious about the rest of the world and Alina. Good job and thanks for sharing.
