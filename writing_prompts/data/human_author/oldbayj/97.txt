This is an interesting snapshot into the mc's life and current troubles. However, the switch between the date and the conversation was a little jarring, and I originally thought the pov in the second part was the person he went on a date with. So I was a bit confused, which pulled me out of the story. I'd suggest finding a way to smooth that out. If the actual date isn't important, and it's the relationship between the two gamers that you want to focus on, I might suggest cutting a lot of the beginning. You could use those words to get deeper into the friendship, and open their possibilities. I think you could end with a much stronger piece.
