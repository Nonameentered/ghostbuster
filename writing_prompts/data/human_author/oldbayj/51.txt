###Nothing Without You, a Love Story

***

She can feel him now; his energy surrounds her. Fallon remembers the last time they stood in this theater, before the abandoned seats and dilapidated pillars. The way her lover's deep hazel eyes locked onto her own. She closes her eyes and takes in a breath, inhaling this moment like it will be her last.
	
Wisps of evergreen and fir balsam envelop her as a cold chill tickles the back of her neck. Fallon drinks in his essence; she lets her body move to the lullaby of their love. Her voice catches in her throat as ghostly fingertips glide across her shoulder blades and up her cheek. 

Fallon and her entangled lover move as one across the dark stage. They don’t need an audience, they never did. 
	
Her feet move gracefully; his hands tightly grasped around her waist. She jumps, soaring through the shadows. The feeling is immeasurable. A perfect landing. Time has dulled nothing. 

The music playing for just them stops. Fallon turns, her ginger locks falling to the side. Her lover’s sharp features come into focus, illuminating the theater like the marquee once did the cobblestone street. 
	
Heartbeats quicken as the room spins around them. 

She exhales.

He smiles.

She nods.

The knife is a welcome chill against her skin. He drops it and blood pools at their feet. But their eyes are locked. Waiting. 

“I’m not me without you,” Fallon whispers, her head buried in his neck. She’s weak and her legs give out beneath her.

Her lover catches her. He pulls her into his embrace. “And without you, I am nothing.”

Soft music echoes through the theater once more as loose debris swarms around them. To the outsider, it’s rather uneventful. But for them, it’s everything. 

Two souls becoming one. Their happily ever after.
