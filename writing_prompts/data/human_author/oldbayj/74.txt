Hey Fye. This was a sweet, emotional story. I like the incorporation of the stone and his spirit within it. 

One moment I thought would have been more powerful and flowed better with just slightly different placement: 

>And. . .for her.
  

  
Her.

I think if you leave the first sentence trailing like this: "And for..." and then leave "Her" on the next line it drops the repetition which is preventing it from packing the punch you're looking for. 

There's a spot I noticed that you switched from past to present tense, which makes it a little confusing, pulling the reader out of story to readjust.

>Dust kicks up as I pour the ash onto the pile of sticks. Tears fell freely from my face to mix with the rising mound of white. 

Overall, I think you have a nice story with great emotional moments. I would like to see you lean a little more into that here. Really pull at the readers' hearts. Thanks for sharing :)
