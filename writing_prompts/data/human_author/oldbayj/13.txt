###The Not-Me Who Wears My Face

The first time I saw myself I screamed so loud the mirror shattered. Death had turned me into its personal jack-o-lantern, carving until there was nothing left. My pale, white skin rotten to the bone. My hair limp against my face, dirty and matted like some kinda eldritch terror.  

This was me now; trapped in five hideous feet of decomposing flesh. 

I thought something would be different when I was gone. But everything was the same. The world just kept on turning. 

Apate, as she called herself, looked like me now—the real me. She stood in my place, in my body, smiling, with her arm draped around my father.

She was taking up *my* space, with *my* family, sucking up *my* air. Like she belonged there. Like she always belonged there. The perfect daughter. 

Cameras snapped and laughter rang out as I watched this cherished moment carry on without me. My father nodding at the not-me, his eyes filled with pride. My mother standing beside him, wondering where the years went. My sister stealing glances from the couch, pretending to be unimpressed.

And the not-me, eating it up, and basking in the glory of another broken deal.  

When the front door opened, a wave of relief washed over me. Even if my own family hadn’t noticed, Terry would, surely. 

Maybe it would be the slight hiss in Apate’s voice. The careless clomp of her feet. The black void in her eyes. Or the way she stood just a little too close. 

He’d see right through her. 

“You look beautiful today,” Terry said, his lips brushing her cheek. 

“Y’think?” She twirled around in the dress my mother had hand-stitched for me. “I’m not sure it’s my color.” 

This was the moment he’d know. I’d picked this fabric specifically for its lavender color.  

He ran a finger through her hair—hair that wasn’t even the right shade. “Of course. You just like to hear me say that.” 

“I guess I do.” Apate giggled, waving her hand. Then she turned to me and winked.

My skin crawled. The anger rose within me like a raging fire, begging to be fed. That hiss. How could they not hear it? And I never did that with my hand. 

But they all just stood there like puppets. Gawking at the monster wearing *my* dress. Going to *my* Homecoming with *my* boyfriend. *Living **my** fucking life.*

And no one noticed. 

I screamed and cried until I hit the floor. I was ready to let the void swallow me up, forever. 

Then I saw it. The faint flicker of distortion—a weakness.

Apate froze, trying so hard to hide her panic. My emotions were draining her power.

I wailed like a banshee in the night. The wall between us fell—and so did her facade. 

“You can’t have my life!” I yelled as she disappeared into the night. 

Apate still hasn’t returned, but I can’t shake the feeling that something is still watching. Waiting for the perfect moment to strike.
