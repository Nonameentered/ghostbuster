Hey there. This was quite an interesting take on theme. I like the interesting character (s?) you've introduced us too. My main crit is that the younger self seems much too accepting, right from the beginning. I mean, this is time travel, a future self appearing in your room from thin air. I'm assuming this is quite unbelievable to the mc. I think adding some body language and extra dialogue questioning, or refusing to believe it, at the beginning would do a lot for the story. (Great stuff in the emotion thesaurus on disbelief and shock, if you want to check those out!)   


I think you've got a good foundation here and with some additional emotional punch it could really stand out. Thanks for sharing!
