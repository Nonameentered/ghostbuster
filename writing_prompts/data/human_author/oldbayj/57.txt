###Death is a Patient Bitch
*(edited version)*
***
It starts with the light scent of wormwood and cedar. The aroma drifts between the swaying branches and becomes one with the thick fog. Its call is undeniable, like fighting the need to breathe. 

I trudge through the forest, barefoot and alone, like I have many times before. Following the trail. Dead branches and twigs snap beneath my feet. The pain radiates up my leg, but I keep going. I always keep going.

The forest is darker and colder than I remember. Its presence clings to me. Creeping into my mind, slipping down the back of my neck, wrapping itself around my insides. Squeezing. 

This time, I can’t let it win. 

A hushed whisper breaks the silence. It’s almost inaudible. The smell of cedar is stronger, and now with faint tones of citrus and vanilla. It's a light at the end of a dark tunnel—my dark tunnel. I want to bathe in its beauty and light, let it wash over me. And guide me out of this Hell. 

The ground rumbles and shakes beneath me. Grey skies become black, the cold turns to ice.  The earth oozes and bubbles. 

I struggle to stay upright as waves of energy tear through the forest. The energy is murky and formless; uncontrolled. It’s everywhere and nowhere, smothering all that is good. It embodies a negativity I haven’t felt since that first night. 

Each time I’m thrust into this world, it’s harder to find my way. Time moves a little faster and my feet a little slower. 

Fractured memories of my life drift into my mind. Faces I know, but don’t. Places I recognize but can’t quite place. Emotions I remember, but don’t feel. 
	
My mind starts to slow as a thick haze blankets my thoughts. Fatigue courses through my veins, it seeps into my bones and constricts my muscles. 

I want to cry out, but my throat throbs with each movement. I must surrender; the thought hovers over me like a dark cloud. The siren song of cedar and hushed whispers fades into the ether.

Death is a hateful bitch. She has spun me around and around like a spider does its prey. I hear her laughing beside me. There’s no way out this time. 

That truth threatens to devour my soul.

“No!” I yell into the darkness. The sound surprises us both. 

I crawl to my knees and drag my body along the forest floor. This won’t be my fate. My chest tightens. My muscles twitch. 

A seering pain rips through my entire body. Death screams as I slip from her icy claws. 

Wormwood and cedar, the smell of home. The aroma envelops me like a warm summer day. 

The forest’s icy chill melts away and my mother’s eyes meet mine. “You had another nightmare, but it’s over,” she says. 

*I’m home.* I force a smile.

But as I run my hands along the three raised claw marks on my back, I know it isn’t over. Death is also a patient bitch.
