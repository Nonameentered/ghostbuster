Of course it's for science! Fye, I loved this. Lots of giggles from me. This scene between the two characters is funny and real. I love that the story is based in dialogue (clearly practicing for the micro constraint and nailing it :p). The Schrödinger’s Box/Cat was just lovely. Great job, again. It was a pleasure to read.
