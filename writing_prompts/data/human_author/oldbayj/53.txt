Hey Kat. I liked this piece, and it certainly goes well with Occult. I love the addition of the Crowley and Mathers, it brought a certain old energy and realistic feel to the piece. However, I was hoping that it would become apparent why they specifically were chosen, and I never found that. It's possibly I missed the connection, so feel free to disregard if that's the case. 

>That evening, Crowley entered Samuelâ€™s quarters.  
 
I found myself needing a transition before this. We jump right from one scene to the next and I think adding a pause here prior to the next scene would ease the transition a bit. 

I enjoyed this, though, it did feel a tad like an introduction to something more with the ending. We don't really get a big reveal, and then it's hinted that the real action is going to happen in the next summoning. Maybe giving us a bit more would help the ending feel a little more satisfying, even maybe tying it in with Aliester and Samuel's presence specifically. But just a thought! 

Thanks for sharing <3
