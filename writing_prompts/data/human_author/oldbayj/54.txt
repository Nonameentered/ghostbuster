Hey Ryritto! That was like.. a totes cool story, brah! Lol (I'm terrible at this!)

I like the energy here as well as the way you incorporated the theme into the piece. I loved the line about "humans give me the heeby jeebies", \*especially\* read in the voice you gave him in Campfire. You bring the characters to life through the dialogue, so bravo there. I don't really have too much in the way of improvement for this specific piece. I'll say that I really enjoy this surfer-bro type personality you so often give your characters, but I'd also love to see you branch out on that a little. But that's not anything bad or related to this piece specifically. I really enjoyed it, thanks for sharing. (And I request more Tweep voice!)
