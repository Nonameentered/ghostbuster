A few people have suggested that course of action, and honestly, I just decided to lean into humans having mediocre competition on earth comparatively as opposed to making it so that we were some titan-level badasses. Wouldn't have been my first 'humans are space orks' piece tho. 

I like to imagine other planets have things like Thresher Maws from Mass Effect while we are stuck with bobbit worms.
