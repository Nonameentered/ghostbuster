It was a deep kinda shame, losing to a ten-year-old with a yellow mouse. The kid had figured out how to cough into his elbow and somehow he’d cleaned me out. 

“Come here,” I bent down to help Slinky off the ground. At some point in the past Slinky had been a Gardner snake in my backyard, but now he was bright purple and four feet long. 

He wasn’t any smarter though.

“So what now?” the kid across from me asked like I wasn’t busy caring for a wounded animal. All the science said that animals like Slinky needed to fight and that a controlled environment was the best way to do it, but it didn’t make me feel better about the singe marks on my snake.

“I don’t know, have a good day? Good job.” I said.

“Are you gong to pay me?”

“What?”

“I won.”

“Yes.”

“So you pay me?”

It took me a second to process that part of the bargain. I’d agreed to essentially walk my snake with this kid and suddenly it was gambling. “Okay what?”

“Well I won so-“

“I’m not paying yo-“ I started but then the kid looked from his mouse that shot literal lightning to me and then back. “Really?”

“What?”

“You’re gonna sick the mouse on me?”

“Well you aren’t paying.”

“That’s…” I took a deep breath, “you’re mugging me. Did mom explain what mugging is?”

“But it’s my money,” the kid pointed out. “Pik-“

“Okay fuck-“ I took two steps back with my snake. “Fuckin Jesus alright. Like twenty bucks?”

“Fine,” the kid started and held out his hand, “I guess.”

“What do you mean ‘I guess?’” I snorted, “you’re TEN. Three bucks to cut a lawn.”

“Forty then.”

“Really? Jesu-“ I stopped “Who told you about this?”

“Everyone does it here,” he said.

“Leave it to New Yorkers…” I considered walking away for a second and testing the kid, but ten-year-olds were the right concoction of naïveté and malice to actually electrocute someone. “Take the money.” I held it out to him.

“Thank you! Let’s battle again some time, do you want my phone number?”

The kid went to pull out his phone and I walked away with my snake. This whole thing was lunacy… so much for a cheap vacation.
