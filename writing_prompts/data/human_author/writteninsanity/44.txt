There is an old adage from before that man was the world's most dangerous game. If you wanted to prove yourself as a hunter, you needed to be able to hunt something as smart as you. 

I always respectfully disagreed with that. A person was a scared lonely thing when they were on the wrong side of a hunt. There were some people that could turn out to be dangerous, but it was more of a lottery than an investment. 

Of course, times had changed, and people had changed too. The first person to survive the plague had turned into a pyrokinetic. The second gained the power of flight. In the end, it turned out if you lived through the virus, you unlocked something within yourself. A generation later, people were just born with the powers.

Three generations later, and the idea of a mundane person is something we all read about in the history books, alongside adages about man being the most dangerous game. 

Most people in the world had fairly mundane powers. Charge allowed you to channel energy into objects, but not really enough to hurt someone. Speedsters were on the rise in North America, Australia had a surprisingly high amount of super strength. 

Everyone having a power had changed the scales though. Something that would have been remarkable before the revolution was boring now. Now the most dangerous game had changed. It wasn't man. It was Omegas and Psis, the tops of the power scale, and people who you'd need to be absolutely suicidal to try to do anything to. 

Luckily I had a death wish. Or at least I kept telling myself that I did. 

My obsession had brought me to a rainy rooftop in Crescent City Oregon, a medium town with big problems. They'd had way more than their fair share of power here and it had been causing... issues for the local populace when there had been battles between the government-mandated officers and idiots on a power trip. 

I'd locked onto one of those idiots this morning, and if I was lucky, I'd move on to one of the officers by the afternoon to even the scales a little bit. Of course that was assuming that my idiot left his house at any point today. 

Elliot Gills had gotten himself into one too many fights recently, but he wasn't quite powerful enough for the Government to worry about putting him down. The man controlled water molecules by forcing them below freezing, which was fairly mundane, but he turned it up to 11 and passively shielded himself with ice from anything that was going to hit him. 

That just meant he couldn't see me. 

Just as I was about to lean back down into the scope of my rifle, it moved several inches to the side. Fuck. 

"Hello,"' I said as I put my hands up without turning around. Things didn't just move on their own. 

"Pray tell what the fuck you're doing?" the woman behind me said. She hadn't walked up. 

"I'm going to turn around," I explained. She was way too calm for someone staring down a gun. This wasn't a random passerby. 

"Fine by me," the girl answered, and I turned to see a fire-haired woman floating several feet off the rooftop with her arms casually in the pocket of her jean jacket. "Zoe McCourtney-" 

"Crescent City Power Control?" I asked and she answered at the same time. 

"Do you want to explain what's going on or should I just take a look?" she asked. Great. Not every telekinetic was a telepath, but that was clearly the case for her. I shrugged. All she needed was a warrant for the inside of my head and that wouldn't have been hard to get considering the circumstances. 

I waited for her to close her eyes and focus at all but instead, she just frowned. "Are you-"

"You have quite the list," she commented, "that's a lot of unsolved murders from around the world attributed to you."

"I-"

"Lot of bad people, but-" she sighed, "good people too. Guessing they tried to stop you like I am?"

"Not always," I answered. Zoe cocked her head to the side for a moment before nodding. She was inside my head, I didn't have to explain anything to her to make her understand. 

I could reach the gun from where I was. From this range I didn't think that she could stop me even if she was powerful. The bullet would be too fast and as long as-

"Don't try it," Zoe protested. 

I dove for the gun and stopped halfway, snapping in place as my extended arm folded in two. I screamed. 

"I said don't," she sighed. "Cleanup team I have a requisition," she said into an earpiece.

Zoe waved a hand, and I flew. 

I passed out after hitting brick.

\----

It wasn't clear how long I'd been out, but it was somewhere around Sunset when I came to at the bottom of an alleyway. Cleanup must have still been on the way. 

I tested my arm, back in working order. That was the chance I needed. I'd locked onto Elliot yesterday evening. 

Everyone had power, and mine was Relentless.
