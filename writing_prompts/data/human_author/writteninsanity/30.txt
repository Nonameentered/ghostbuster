"They thought we would just accept a draconian measure like that?" Officer Williamson mused as he surveyed the freshly polished cannoneer stations on the battleship 'Gunboat Diplomacy'. 

"Sounds like bullshit to me sir," ensign Rossman said while keeping his nose in a clipboard to take notes on the refurbished ship. 

"Show those damn bugs what-for," Williamson said as he nodded. The cannoneer stations had all been retrofitted to work with Valkyrie MKIVC technologies. He'd been in the Navy for a long time and he'd never had the budget approval to do something like this, but things had changed. 

When the Council had used a bioweapon to artifically restrict the birthrate of humans on three seperate colonies, there had been an immidiate call for withdrawal from the Galactic scene and a rallying cry for war. Of course, the UHP hadn't immidiately declared War on the galaxy, but they had been preparing for the past serveral years for billions of new recruits and  quadrillions of dollars in donations from the populace. 

War had been coming for a while, it just hadn't been declared. 

The bigger spit in the face was that the Galactic Council had welcomed the humans back to their meetings the next day as if nothing had happened. They simply moved on as they seemed to from every other tragedy. Lacking the humanity to understand anything other than logistics. 

The humans had been told in the past several years that their military buildup was 'wasteful' and 'better allocated to upraising other species,' but that was because they didn't realize that humans got pissed and critically, stayed pissed about petty things, let alone something as drastic as non-consensual gene editing.

Williamson had been one of the recruits that volunteered after the bio-weapon was used on First Bastion, and his sister had been one of those affected. In the past three years he'd proven his skill at logistics and was now one of the six Officers below Captain Spigot on Gunboat Diplomacy. 

The gunner stations were ready to go, and this was critical, because today was the first day of the rest of their lives. Gunboat Diplomacy, Revisionist History and Warning Shot were on the front lines. They were going to be some of the first ships through the hypergate alongside the declaration of war. Each of them was armed to the teeth with power systems that could barely handle anything other than firepower.

They were line breakers. 

"Gunboat Diplomacy, change launch course 3.223 degrees. Overall trajectory similar," came the robotic voice over the spearker. 

Willaimson took a deep breath, and then a second. "Ensign,"

"Yes sir," Rossman didn't look up from their clipboard for the first moment, but Williamson wasn't facing them to see the break in protocal. 

"Send out the notification for battle stations, with the trajectory change we are going to be at approach in sub 30."

"Yes sir," Rossman repeated before taking off back down the hallway that they'd come down in the first place, past the right gunner stations and into the crews quaters.

Williamson took another deep breath. Captain Spigot had shared intel with him about the upcoming attack. It was essentially a suicide mission on all accounts. Despite the size of the fleet the humans were sending to over three dozen Council controlled spaces, there was still a  chance that they'd miscalcuated the weaponry on the other side and would die in the vaccum of space before they'd fired a single shot of vangence. 

Of course, everyone knew how dangerous being on the front lines was, Spigot had just shared some more of the details. In the end, there was a reason that all of the recruits on ships like the Gunboat Diplomacy had family affected by the sterilization. 

Williamson knew he might die, but he also knew that he would never have a nephew, and that was the courage he needed to give the order through the Veil gate, into the unknown, alongisde a declaration of war.
