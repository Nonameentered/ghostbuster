Two things were very clear from the moment I woke up. 

First; I was going to need a bigger apartment, as mine had a no-pets clause. 

Second; I was going to be single forever.

At the foot of my bed, curled up the best it could, was a heaping mass of evergreen scales that took up the entirety of where my laundry typically went. Its tail wrapped around the bed with the tip weaving between the wheels of the second hard office chair I'd picked up when I started working from home.

I leaned forward, still half under the covers and grabbed the pad of legal paper that had been left on top of the blankets. The mass of scales rumbled. 

*Hello, you might find yourself oddly calm right now. That will wear off eventually, just wanted to give you a chance to get settled.* 

Fair enough.

*This is Ruth, she's yours for the time being. A friend had hatchlings and I did what I could. Though did let them know that you might find the whole thing too much. Don't worry they're okay with taking her back if you change your mind.* 

Okay. 

*Oh! On the next page, there is a care manual. Dietary needs and all of that. Use the everlasting purse around her neck to get the money for food (Chicken is expensive in your time!). As for the boyfriend. I forgot to mention that I couldn't make love happen at the top, and seeing as I'd forgotten to explain the rules I felt like I should make the first wish work. Please don't take me avoiding the boyfriend wish as a commentary on you, I imagine you'll make the right person very lucky.* 

That made sense, but at the same time they really didn't have to make the boyfriend thing a big deal unless they were specifically trying to avoid me taking it as a bad thing, which meant it was likely a bad thing and all of that. 

*I said don't take it like that.* 

Were the first words on the next page. 

"Touche magic man," I whispered to myself to avoid waking up... Ruth? That didn't feel like a draconic name but who was I to judge. I'd never named a dragon before. I jumped to the next page to see what the first orders were.

\---

*Step One: Meeting your new dragon.*   


*Meeting your dragon as they wake up is the key to success.*

*It's imperative that your first meeting with your dragon is positive, which means approaching them with kindness and care. Consider a mother waking up her child for school in the morning, or the birds chirping you awake on a camping trip.* 

*Assuming you have a young dragon, this is going to initiate a situation called bonding. It's harmless and non-magical. It simply means that the dragon is going to see you as a parental figure, which is very useful in the early stages of their life when English and other common languages are going to be beyond their grasp. This bonding will let them know that you're not food, and understand that you're in charge. Think a moderately trained dog.* 

*A moderately trained dog that is impervious to all mundane weapons and has elemental mastery. For more information on that part of the program see Steps 10-273: Staying Out of Trouble.* 

*If you have access to it, a good thing to do during this first meeting is to offer the dragon some sort of food. This food does not necessarily need to be on the recommended diet list (See Step 3: Feeding Your Dragon) as Dragons are omnivores, but dragons do tend to have a propensity towards the food you first feed them, so ensure it's something you have easy access to, as it will make training easier.* 

"Okay, so I am going to be teaching you what a treat is," I said to the sleeping dragon like it was awake and could understand me. In the back of my head, behind some shadowy glass, there was another part of me that also screamed about it being a fucking dragon but hey, that was something I needed to worry about next. People were going to freak out when they heard I had a dragon, only rich people were ever able to convince one to live with them. 

The only thing close to my bed was a small bag of sour keys that I kept at my desk because they were delicious and my dentist hated me. So that was going to have to do because there as no way I was getting to the bedroom door without waking Ruth up and I'd been told to make sure that I didn't trip over her as a meet and greet. 

I stretched nice and long to fetch the sour keys then rolled over to the side of the bed that Ruth's head was just below. I tried to find a small space of floor to stand on, but there was none. I settled for lying the wrong way on the bed, hanging my torso off the foot of it to look close to Ruth's eyes.

Her teeth were bigger than most knives I owned. That should have been unsettling.

"Wakey wakey eggs and bakery," I chimed channelling my best Saturday morning mother.  "Ruuuuuuth," I continued a moment later when the dragon didn't respond. 

An eyelid fluttered, and then there was a huff.

"Ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuth Hollings," I gave her my last name because I didn't figure she had one. Ruth cracked one eye open, and I offered a soft little wave. Her pupil almost swallowed her entire eye but it was a dak pure green instead of black. "Heyyyyy," I let trail on for a moment as she opened the second eye and stared at me. 

"I don't know what the next step is!" I said in the same sing-song voice as I held out a sour-key to the dragon that could have easily swallowed my entire arm. Ruth sniffed my hand twice, and then a careful, snake-like tongue slithered out of her mouth and wrapped around the candy before disappearing back inside. Leaving me vaguely covered in dragon spit.

Ruth rumbled , but it sounded more like a purr than a snore this time. 

"I should have read ahead," I commented again as Ruth wiggled a touch across the floor to get her considerably inside my personal space. Was I supposed to leave now? Was it okay if I got back up to grab the notepad? Was my mother right when she said that I needed to start planning beyond the next 30 seconds? 

Ruth's nose pressed against mine. It was warm, pleasant, like hot rocks at a spa. 

She also hadn't eaten me yet, and the part of me the dream man had locked away for the time being told me that I was very lucky for that. 

They were right. I was lucky. I had a dragon.
