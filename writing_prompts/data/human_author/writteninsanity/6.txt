Athlena stood outside the head office of her main sponsor; she'd been told to wait there twenty minutes ago by an assistant in what was, at this point, a power play. That said, she would stay here until someone saw her until she got an explanation about everything going on.

For many of the heroes, the original idea had been to fly into the capital and speak to the Federal government. Others had talked them down to speaking to provincial powers, and everyone knew that local mayors wouldn't be able to do anything.

It was only a few of them, the ones that had been in the 'game' the longest, who understood that the first people they should speak to were the sponsors. Athlena wasn't the oldest hero on the council by a wide margin, but she'd been defending the streets since she was fourteen, and she understood how things went.

That understanding was what kept her there wearing meticulously designed Athlena brand sneakers, one on the ground and one resting casually against the wall. In front of her, an indoor fountain burbled and above it, the gleaming ogo lit up even though it was indoors.

Vultani Insurance.

Athlena tapped her foot against the wall as she thought about the civilian phone in her pocket. Was the hallway too public to pull it out? Anyone looking at her location would either ask why it was off or, if they were paying too much attention, ask why she was visiting corporate insurance companies.

No, there had been too much scrutiny over identity after the tear in her mask last month. The phone would stay away for now.

"Athlena!" a forced friendly voice greeted as the door to the sponsorship management office opened and Hector poked his head though, "lovely to see ya. Sorry about the wait," he pushed the rest of the door open while taking a step away so Athlena could walk through, "I was on a call. Monday mornings, right?"

By the time Hector was finished talking, Athlena was already in the room behind him. She offered a quick and noncommital 'yeah' and closed the door behind her.

"What're you here for? Can I get you a drink?" Hector was halfway around his desk once he'd started speaking again, reaching for the intercom to call a drink before Athlena had confirmed.

"Hector, we need to talk."Hector paused his finger over the button to call his assistant. "That," he used his other hand to point at Athlena, "is why you're here." He took half a breath and smiled back at her, "but you didn't answer my drink question. Coffee? Orange Juice? Something harder?"

"Hector," Athlena took a step towards the desk but didn't move far enough to sit down in the chair made for visitors. "I don't need a drink."

"Fair," Hector pulled his finger away from the button and instead moved his hand over to the armrest of his chair. He made no move to unbutton his jacket and sit down, "enough."

"Okay, I-"

"Lemme stop you there," Hector held up a single finger, "if this is about the scripts for the new sponsor spot. I haven't gotten to see those yet-"

"Hector-"

"They were supposed to come to me on Tuesday, and then you'd get them on Wednesday after edits but-"

"Hector."

"If you've already got them, then it's not something I've approved, and I can talk to the writing team. Honestly, it's so hard to get people who understand your brand and how important these issues are too" Hector stopped once it was explicitly clear that his motoring on was annoying the hero. He leaned over, picked up his cooling coffee, and then took one step away from her, leaning against the glass wall instead of sitting at his desk. Behind Hector, the Toronto skyline was sketched in fog. "S'not about the scripts then?" he asked after a moment.

"I haven't seen the script," Athlena pointed out. For a moment, she wanted to ask what the 'issues' were, but she was here on a mission, and the point wasn't to talk about what Hector wanted to. "I've-" Athlena took a moment to think about her words, opening her mouth to continue several times before finally settling on something. "I've been getting a lot of questions about corporate lobbying-"

"From the press?" Hector cut her off.

"From the Council," Athlena corrected, "specifically about spikes around the issuing of the annual empowers status accords." Once she brought up the issue, Athlena watched Hector's face, waiting for surprise or some sign of guilt, but the man was a blank slate. He either didn't know anything about it or was much better at this than she was.

"Huh," Hector answered first, moving his second hand up to wrap both around his much. He clicked his tongue twice. "And that's got you worried?"

Once again, it took Athlena a second to respond, "I don't know."

"Why would it worry you?" Hector asked, "maybe there is a big gala around then but-" Hector shrugged.

Athlena nodded along, but she knew that there weren't any big fundraisers around the time. They'd looked into that.

"Look," Hector continued, "I like working with heroes. Some other suits in here like working with the government. Sponsoring you," he took a step forward and put down the mug, and then used his free hand to motion to Athlena, "is fun, but it's a corporate interest. It's an image thing, right?"

"Sure," Athlena answered once it was clear that Hector was waiting for her to respond.

"Lobbying is kinda icky; I'll admit, not my jam. That's-" Hector was walking around the desk to Athlena, "why I'm down here with you." Once he was solidly on her side of the desk, he leaned against it. Now the two of them were closer to a private conversation than a meeting. "buuuuut-" Hector let the word trail on for a long time. "We need some people up the chain to be on our side, and donations ensure that they'll listen to us."

"I understand that," Athlena answered, "but the timing is-"

"November," Hector said, "my best guess is that it's close to the end of the fiscal and-" he motioned around the room as if pandering to an audience that wasn't there, "maybe the money guys just want the tax credits in at a certain time."

"So-"

"Look," Hector took half a step forward off the desk, now practically in whispering range of Athlena, "if I knew who we were able to bring on next year, I'd be telling you so you could convince them to come to us. I don't only manage you and-" he leaned in, now actually whispering, "if I could tell you who was going to be on what side, I would."

Athlena licked her teeth instead of responding. Hector pulled away.

"I'm part of your team, and you're part of mine," Hector said once he was back to a normal volume. "That's my time for this surprise meeting, though. I have a ten o'clock."

Athlena bit her lip. "All happenstance?"

"Suits like me gotta play our dumb games," Hector put his hands in his pockets and offered one last shrug. "How do you feel about the drink?"

"I'll pass," Athlena answred; once she did Hector offered a soft nod toward the door. Athlena obeyed.

She didn't check to ensure that the wire had gotten everything until she was on a nearby rooftop. Shed been hoping for something definite. She'd been a hero too long to believe when someone said that it was just a coincidence but-

Right now, she had nothing. Maybe someone else would have the speech they needed, but until then, Athlena needed to be on the streets.

That and she needed to convince herself that she wasn't just some corporate thug.
