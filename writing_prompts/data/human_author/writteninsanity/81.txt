According to the aliens, we humans blew first contact way out of proportion. They came to Earth to tell us that we needed to slow down, and we had them trending around the world in seconds.

The US Government, after over a hundred years of trying, had created an engine that folded space onto itself and leapt from one place to another, which allowed them to fly faster than the speed of light. Of course, the second we'd done that, the life we'd been searching for forever knocked on our door and handed us a speeding ticket.

See, as it turned out, humans had been incredibly unlucky when it came to finding alien species. Every attempt to reach out, listen, call, or message had been a single degree off of finding a biodiverse Galactic community. In fact, the Galaxy at large had assumed that we knew about them but didn't want to talk. What else did you think about someone seemingly intentionally ignoring you?

The first alien showing up on Earth to hand us a speeding ticket (to be paid in drinkable water, mind you) was a worldwide phenomenon. The eighth one to arrive with an infraction was just under #Earthday on Twitter, and once the Fotuan congress came to try and broadcast a PSA about intergalactic school zones to the planet, pretty much everyone on Earth considered it white noise.

Plus, as it turned out, there was a whole Galactic Community, but we couldn't even join it because we didn't meet our sector's required planetary beautification initiatives. Everest was too high for our tallest mountain, and the Marianas Trench was too deep. Australia was much too brown overall because of the deserts, and what was that giant brick thing in China? In fact, it would have taken trillions of dollars to match all of the requirements for joining the Galactic Community.

So we didn't, and everything was fine.

Twenty days after the PSA debacle, a Miani administrator flew down to our atmosphere to administer a request, which would turn into fine after a week.

*Good Afternoon Earthlings*

*The structure you know as the 'International Space Station' is 3 inches too large and breaks the Galactic Community's 'Non-Celestial Objects in Orbit' protocols. Please remove the station by the end of the week, or turn it into a planetary body.*

*Yours,*

*The Planet Owners Association.*

It took us a while to figure out what the hell that was. After all, we'd just been told that we couldn't join the galactic community, so we surely weren't violating their rules. It turned out that, even if we weren't members, we were still expected to uphold the protocols of the Planet Owners Association, which was bullshit.

In the end, the world's governments, now combined to attempt to work with the aliens, ended up transferring the ISS to a moon-base or at least attempting to, but a week later, a Fotuan ship was in our atmosphere beaming a message to our leaders.

*Good Evening Earthlings,*

*We noticed you're working on some celestial construction, but you didn't submit for a permit from the POA to work within space during prime hours of the day. Please limit your actions.*

*Also, friendly reminder that you are only allowed to have 21 ships enter or leave your atmosphere every day. Anything greater is uncomfortable for your sector neighbours.*

*Thanks!*

*The Planet Owners Association.*

So we limited how many ships we flew into the atmosphere each day, which drastically slowed how quickly we could build a new moonbase. Some of the former leaders complained about bowing down to such a fundamentally annoying and petty order. Still, it was easier than declaring war on the Galaxy or whatever would happen if we didn't follow the rules they set out for us.

For a year and a half, everything was going relatively well. Sure we were getting notes from the POA almost daily, but speaking to representatives and matching demands of the POA became a full-time job for thousands of humans. A new industry was created doing projects that seemed like an incredible waste of time, like digging a small trench through 3 cities in Canada.

Everything was fine, of course, until the last letter.

*Good Evening Earthlings,*

*During a routine colours inspection, we noticed that your oceans, when viewed from orbit, are on average #0F123F or 'Oxford Blue'. Please apply colourant to adjust this to at least #131853 'Royal blue dark,' or lighter.*

*Thanks!*

*The Planet Owners Association.*

The vote was unanimous. Humans were done with the POA, even if it meant war.

As it turned out, there were no real consequences for breaking the rules that the POA suggested. There were a lot of passive-aggressive letters, sure, but we were free to ignore those.

Most of the human race wanted to go to war anyway.
