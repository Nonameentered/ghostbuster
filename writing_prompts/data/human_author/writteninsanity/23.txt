Griffin took a deep breath and let his bag fall off his shoulder onto the scuffed hardwood of his new apartment, the bag landed with a metallic clang that was likely too harsh for the  aging floor. This was supposed to be home. No. It was going to be home. He just needed to decorate... or something. 

Once he'd put down the bag, Griffin doubled back to the door and grabbed the small envelope that had been stuck there with scotch tape. "Welcome new neighbor!" was written on the envelope in a slick, practiced cursive. 

Griffin didn't bother opening the envelope before bringing it inside with him to survey the small line of boxes that he'd managed to bring with him to the new place. Movers were going to be here later in the week, but until then this was what he had. 

On the far side of the living room, there was a false fireplace, the kind that really was just a heater and a projection of fire, but it had been one of the selling points that the agent had really harped one when Griffin had been looking at the place. Admittedly, the familiar feeling of sitting around the fire was part of what had convinced Griffin. 

Above the false fireplace, there was a marble mantle, meant to make it look like this was a proper hearth. Griffin eyed the space and then the empty wall space above it. After a moment he stalked across the room to grab a long felt wrapped package that was leaning in the corner. 

Griffin carefully unwrapped the package on his way back to the hearth, revealing Slygithyr, the Shattering Gale, the runic sword was freezing cold in Griffin's hands, but he held it like an old friend before placing it on the mantle. Griffin held onto the hilt of Slygithyr for several seconds too long. 

Common sense and all the guidebooks told adventurers to get rid of their enchanted equipment when they hung up the cloak and headed to the big city, but- 

Was Slygithyr different? Or was Griffin just being too sentimental for his own good?

"Hello?" came a squeak from just outside the room. Griffin spun, pulling Slygithyr in line with the door as he did. A gloved hand pulled the barely ajar door out into the hallway and the woman opening the door stopped as soon as one of her eyes caught the blade. "Hello," she repeated.

"Sorry," Griffin responded as he lowered Slygithyr. That was another thing that the guidebooks had talked about, the same instincts that would save your life outside the walls were an inconvenience inside. "Sorry."

"Is this a bad time?" the woman asked. She had the disheveled look of someone who'd just gotten home from work. 

"It's fine," Griffin answered, letting Slygithyr fall to his side, stopping it half an inch above the ground in a motion he'd practiced a million times before, "really."

"Okay," the woman said. Now that Griffin had gotten at better look at her dark hair and darker circles under her eyes he was able to read how friendly she was trying to be. "Everyone was asking who was coming into the building," she said, "but I didn't know were a-" she paused. 

"Former adventurer," Griffin explained before pulling Slygithyr up and moving to place it on the mantle. 

"I wasn't sure if it was that or a collector," she commented, "but you really do look like more of an adventurer." Griffin added 'a little old for one' to the end of her sentence in his head. 

"I suppose that's good," he noted before reaching into his pocket and pulling out the envelope that had been taped to the door, "this yours?"

"Well I wrote it," she answered, finally taking a step through the door into the apartment, "but it's *for* you. "

"Thanks," Griffin said out of habit. 

"Don't thank me yet," she corrected, "I'm just a stupid note saying hi. I'm in room 1208."

"Well I'm here," Griffin pointed out, putting the note back in his pocket for the time being and finish the ritual of placing Slugithyr on the mantle, where it would stay until someone worthy came along to replace Griffin, "and I'm Griffin."

"Celia," she responded, "good to have you here."

"Good to be here," Griffin responded out of habit, but he just knew that it was time to be here, he wasn't sure it was good to be here yet.
