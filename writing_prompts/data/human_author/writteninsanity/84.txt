Ashes, a C-Class villain, loomed over the city, with his fleet of Scourgebots behind her, and her death ray levelled at the falling Brigadier. She'd just struck the penultimate blow against the strongest hero that Metropl had, and that meant that she was about to take over an entire city, something unheard of for A Class Villains, let alone C class trash like her. 

Brigadier slammed into the ground, cracking asphalt and sidewalk. Dust plumed into the air, and the city watched Ashes. This was her moment, something to push her into the highest tier of Villainy, the cackling council. The villain snapped her fingers, and one of her scourgebots zipped over, picking her up and taking her down to the fallen hero. 

Ashes cape billowed in the wind as she stalked over to her prey. Her black silhouette stood proud and brilliant on the fire behind her, and the shining A on her chest flashed with enough bravado to inspire fear and awe. Her costume was absolutely brilliant, a masterclass in threatening design, and it was worn by the woman who was tucking the barrel of her deathray nearly under the chin of Brigadier. 

"Tsk tsk tsk," she started before mentally checking her notes. Chiding him was a good start, but now she needed to capitalize on it. "You absolutely idi- I mean...," she paused for way too long, trying to find the words, "You absolute fool. You thought you could batt- Challenge me?"

"You'll never defeat the spirit of Metropol, fiend," Brigadier spat back, playing his part perfectly.

"Oh, but I will! And I- Well, spirit is a metaphysical concept that really doesn't have a quantifiable source of power, so I guess.. I don't think I could have really killed the spirit because I'm not sure the spirit of this place is something I can actually fi-" Ashes pulled the death ray away from Brigadier's jaw for a second to cross her arms and think about what Brigadier had suggested. "Oh my God, that was a metaphor, wasn't it? Shit. Okay. Um-" she tried to get the gun back in the same pose, but it never quite felt the same. 

The cameras were rolling. A news helicopter was billowing dramatic wind around the scene as they got a perfect shot of the hero's final moments.   


"Uh. You're going to die!" Ashes said.

'Really?' Brigadier mouthed as his opponent. Was he really going to die in this mess? He would have preferred to have been shot on the way down from the sky; at least then, his landing would have been dramatic. "Even if you kill me, someone will step up to take my place and face you again," he finally responded to Ashes' weak line. Brigadier's voice boomed around the shattered street, triumphing over the villains' meek squeaks. 

"Based on the hero rankings, that's unlikely," Ashes began, which would have been a decent comeback, but she kept talking, "you see, you're ranked third among the A-Class heroes, which means that most of the heroes are below you and I will be able to kill them if I was able to kill you. It's just math. If you look at the stats, then-" 

Ashes was cut off by a rock thrown by a nearby citizen that clocked her in the back of the skull. The villainous monologue was supposed to trap the surrounding populace in a bind of fear, but she'd been performing so poorly that they had time to fight back. 

"Was that just a-" Ashes stepped off of Brigadier's chest and pointed her death-ray at the assembled crowd. "Who threw that? That was super rude! I'll fight you next if you want me to! I-"

Ashes was too busy questioning the people behind her to notice Brigadier pulling himself off the ground, his costume was ripped in dramatic but aesthetic ways, and he had a sweet new scar over his eye that would later make him look grizzled and battle-hardened.   


**"You talk too much."**

&#x200B;

Brigadier slammed his fist into the back of Ashes' head and sent her careening into a nearby building. Somehow the tremendous impact just knocked her out instead of killing her, as was the heroic way.

The hero took a deep breath and then spat a not-medically dangerous but certainly cool amount of blood out of his mouth. He quickly looked around the crowd and thought about striking his signature pose, but the crowd was already getting back to their errands and work. Nobody was sticking around for the end of this performance. 

"Goddammit," Brigadier swore before floating over to Ashes and grabbing the unconscious villain by the ankle and flying her off to jail so she could break out after reading a few more books on public speaking.
