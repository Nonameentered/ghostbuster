Jesus, part of God themselves and also the Son. The man who was both one part of and all of the Trinity, felt a single bead of sweat drip down his brow when Lucifer had grabbed his attention for three seconds during this arduous litigation. He hadn't expected Lucifer to be so open about the fact that he had spent some time down there, but the literal devil was playing smart.

Lucifer was in the court of the corruption of souls. Running hell was just his job, and rebelling against God had long since been forgiven through an eternity of community service, but something had changed in the past thousand years. Instead of the potential climb from Hell to Purgatory to Paradise, Lucifer had been pulling spirits further and further away from God with their sin by offering them vices in hell instead of penance and virtues.

Jesus took a deep breath and drummed his fingers on the bench in front of him, waiting for the recess to start. What had Satan meant by a good word? What was he going to tell Dad? That Satan was misguided? He knew that. Was he going to tell him that most things God considered sins weren't harmful to humans anymore? God hadn't pay attention to cultural trends since he became so salty he turned a city into it. The man was stuck in his ways and was never going to accept that letting people indulge in alcohol, drugs and whatever acts they wanted that didn't hurt another person was... well it was fine.

Of course, it had taken quite the experience for Jesus to learn that. He'd gone down to hell for three days and Satan had shown him that so many things in the Bible really didn't matter, let alone matter once humans were post-scarcity in certain locations. Sure some things could be harmful to the person engaging in those, but even then, as longs as the stream of drugs was kept regulated by the demons it was better to let addicts work it out than tie them to a slab for thousands of years.

The court broke for recess with the case essentially set in stone. Peter had just waxed on for the last half-century about the fact that there were fewer and fewer people coming to the gates of heaven, at least compared to Earth's per-capita population.  Heaven was getting some major empty space in the last couple of years because Satan hadn't been sending the converts and Peter wanted to keep his job. Of course, his testimony had been damning.

As the assembled angels filed out of the divine court and into the divine lobby, Satan was dragged out by several of the archangels, but not before he had time to shoot Jesus subtle finger guns.

Jesus had two options, convince his father that sin had turned around, or leave himself open to being dragged back down to hell with Satan at the end of the trial. Jesus chose to stay behind in the courtroom, with his father's throne infinite and brilliant in front of him.

"Something wrong?" the father asked.

"Many things trouble me," Jesus did his best to avoid slipping into modern language. He was more connected to the Earth than his father and thus much more likely to describe something as 'no good' which would have gotten him a whole smack of questions, like why he was speaking English instead of Hebrew.

"Like?" God asked.

"Well-" Jesus started.

"Satan's bribe?"

"Uh-"

"You and I are one and the same," God stated, "both part of the Trinity and separate from one another. I am omniscient and unending. I know of your change and how it affects you. Satan may say what he wants on the stand, it will not affect judgement upon you."

"If he were to-"

"If he were to say what he means to say on the stand, that the son of God indulged in the sins of the mortal worlds for three days and still came back the son of God," if the concept of God could motion towards a single being, he would have been motioning toward his son, "then it would say something about the sins of the world and their relationship with you, and me, and the spirit in each person."

"And you wouldn't be an-" Jesus started.

"I was furious," God corrected, "but those were years ago when I did those things. I was also furious about your death, but forgiveness, which you gave to all, is a powerful thing."

"Then what about the humans not coming to heaven and-"

"Satan continues to do the important part of his job," God pointed out, "the sinners that harm others find repentance in Hell and end up... somewhere in the Divine Comedy. Those that didn't harm others but were distant from me find happiness in whatever place they find happiness in. Whether that is at my right hand, or the right hand of the rebellion."

"That's progressive," Jesus pointed out.

"Forgiveness is," God started, "and I learned two thousand years ago that what I cared about more than my plan, was the happiness of my children. I learned that lesson from you, and I try to carry it forward."

"Then-" Jesus started, "why did we need to have this trial?"

God chuckled, which hadn't happened many times in the infinite. "This trial led to this conversation. Which is the one that you, and by extension, I, needed to have."
