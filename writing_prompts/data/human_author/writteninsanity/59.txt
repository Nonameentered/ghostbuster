“Hi, this is mission support, I’m Albricht, how can I help your quest?”

“Hello this is-” 

An explosion roared over the other end of the line for a moment.

 “This is Killian, on the quest to kill the Demon Lord Benezial, we just ran into a small iss-“

“Pardon before we get too far ahead of ourselves I am going to need an account number.”

“Oh uh, sorry. It’s… shit um… does the prophecy work?”

“Sorry, it’s clearly stated on our privacy policy that I cannot help you with your quest unless I have the account number and the name of the p-“

“Sorry I found it! It’s 534352t2, and I’m Killian.”

“Hi Killain, I need a full name.”

“Killian Hendivin,” Killian answered. Another explosion.

“Pardon that would include any given titles.”

“Killian Hendivin, Gale of the North Winds, Attributor of the Second Clan, and Judgement’s Blade.”

“Fan-tas-tic, can I get a credit card from you, sir Killian?”d humming and some typing going on in the background.

“Would you mind hurrying there-“

“One moment please,” Albricht repeated. More typing. “I have your account here. You’re on the quest to slay the-“

“Demon Lord Benezial,” Killian finished, faster than Albricht would have.

“That is what I have here. Has he been slain?”

Killain waited for the screams to end before speaking. “Yes, but there is a small wrinkle in that.”

“Pardon. If he’s been-“

“He didn’t die when we killed him.”

“Sorry Sir Attributor of the Second Clan, I don’t think you killed him then. Things die when they are killed.”

“Well, he didn’t,” Killian protested, “we killed him and then he yelled ‘Mere mortals! If killing me could kill me I would have died a thousand years ago!’ before stabbing Elisa.”

“Sir, I just need to clarify that you and the Demon Lord Benezial understand what killing someone means.”

“We killed him!”

“Have you tried killing him again?”

“Yes we’ve-“ a pause. “Are you kidding me?” Killain swore while holding the phone a touch away from his ear. “Rhena! Can you kill Benezial?... YES AGAIN!... I know the guy on the phone is asking me to..” Screams and evil cackling erupted from the other end. “YOU MORTAL FOOLS TRIED THAT AGAIN? YOU’RE JOKING!” The Demon Lord Benezial bellowed loud enough to get caught by the call monitoring for quality assurance purposes.

“Okay, thank you for confirming that-“ Albricht said. More typing.

“You’re welcome,” Killian hissed.

The silence was prolonged and cost many lives.

“Ah! Found it, are you sure the Kingdom is at optimal upheaval? It looks like your prophecy plan specifies that the Kingdom must be in peril to constitute a savoir clause.”

“People are dying-“

“If you’d like to upgrade to our Prophecy Plus Plan you can assign yourself a kingdom in upheaval before going on a quest so that you are fighting for a foretold cause.”

“Fine.”

“Fan-tas-tic, can I get a credit card from you sir Killian?”
