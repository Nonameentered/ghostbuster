"Cellblock Alpha Tango Charlie, requesting status on prisoner Three Dash Nine Dash Two. Over."

Vincent checked over his shoulder to the unmoving man in the cell behind him. Richard Myers hadn't moved in the past two days aside from taking shallow assisted breaths, which wasn't a good sign for one of the most prolific serial killers on the Eastern Seaboard.

"Control this is Alpha Tango Charlie. Prisoner status is consistent with last check, over." Vincent clicked his tongue twice without taking his finger off the 'speak' button of the radio. "Alpha Tango Charlie requesting confirmation of the rescheduled extension surgery for Three Nine Two."

Vincent let go of the radio and slotted it back onto its holster on his chest. He'd been the man in charge of Richard since the man had turned one hundred and fifteen. Vincent had a mother die and reach out as a child since he'd taken on the job. Vincent had kids grow up and head off to university since he'd taken the job. Eight friends had gotten married, three had divorced and Vincent had gone from overwhelmed kid to a slightly greying man...

and yet, Richard Myers was still alive and kicking. Granted, he was only kicking because he was tied to so many machines they looked like marionette strings. It almost felt unfair that someone got their life extended by being a heinous man, but it was better than the alternative.

"Cellblock Alpha Tango Charlie repeating request for extension surgery update for Three Dash Nine Dash Two," Vincent said into the radio. It wasn't uncommon for the radios to be busy out here in the grey sea, but Richard Myers certainly had priority.

Silence made Vincent sweat, and Richard laugh.

Well, Richard couldn't laugh, those haunting vocal cords had been pulled out years ago to remove a tumour, and the vacuum oxygen seal around his face was too perfect to let sound reach Vincent, but reality hardly mattered. Vincent felt something wrong, and he could hear Richard laughing behind him.

Myers was one of the most prolific killers of all time because he'd been reincarnated three times in a row. Getting a single chance at reincarnation was astounding. Two was a miracle, and three was a trend. Everyone in the Grey Sea, and certainly Vincent, understood that when Myers died, he was coming back, and catching him was going to be near imp-

Three buzzes on the wrist stole Vincent from his thoughts and the phantom laughter. Vitals were dropping again and the intervention machine, which added adrenaline to Myers system to compensate for the looming reaper was flashing an error message.

Myers was dying.

Vincent swapped to the loudspeaker instead of proper channels, "Alpha Tango Charlie calling for an immediate consult, Dr. Felding to Alpha Tango Charlie NOW." Vincent stopped for a second only to catch three more short buzzes on his wrist. Just as he was about to clarify into the radio another voice came over the loudspeaker.

"Dr. Felding to cellblock Bravo Whiskey Del-"

"Dr. Felding to Kilo Li-

"-November requesting immediate assistance."

Over and over again the loudspeaker blared as systems across the Grey Sea began to fail. The subtle buzz on Vincent's wrist twisted into a manic scream was a warning turned into an alarm.

Vincent threw open the doors to the containment system. Dr. Felding wasn't coming. Nobody was coming, but he had training. He just needed to ensure that the main system stayed online long enough to keep the bastard breathing and help would be on the way at some point.

"Four Two Five Two," Vincent hummed to himself as he typed in the code to grab the emergency epinephrine syringe. He snatched it from the still opening container and typed in a second code to expose some of Myers' skin.

The ancient killed looked up at Vincent with empty but sparkling eyes. He understood what was happening. He knew he was escaping, but Vincent was sure he was wrong. This needle was..

Empty.

The epinephrine had been expended days ago by someone meant to refill the machines and it hadn't been caught by the failsafe, and the same discovery was being made around the Grey Sea. Vincent uselessly jabbed the exposed needle into Richard Myers's leg, just as the killer's sparkling eyes went grey.

Richard Myers's corpse smiled.
