I had a twin. 

Twins weren't particularly rare, but they were certainly uncommon. That said, the reason that this had been a big deal was that I'd been raised as an only child by my single Dad. It had just been him and me for years, but then he'd dropped a bomb on me, right as I was supposed to be leaving for university. 

I had a twin, and I had a Mom. 

I'd said some things I hadn't meant when my Dad had tried to explain everything. He'd told me that he had been hiding me, and I'd responded that I'd hated him for it. Unfortunately, I'd left for school without settling things up with him, which meant that I'd been trying to patch up everything I'd said with phone calls and check-ins. 

That said, I wasn't about to call my Dad from the bus. I was doing the exact thing he'd explicitly told me not to do; I was looking for my sister. 

See, he'd told me that something had happened when we were little, but he'd skimped on the details. All I knew was that she was out there with my Mom, and I was going to find her. We could figure the rest of the story out once that happened. 

Luckily my Dad had warned me that I would feel a pull toward her, that my 'gut feeling' to take a trip or jump on a certain train was going lead me to her. He'd meant for me to avoid it, but of course, I was using it as a GPS. 

Ten hours into the bus ride, I peeled my face from the felt back of the seat in front of me. I was on my way across the province, and following my gut meant I hadn't quite considered how long it was going to take to find my sister. I'd packed snacks and charged my phone but the USB port on the bus wasn't enough to keep my games awake for long. 

The bus pulled up to the station we were grabbing new passengers from. A couple of years back, someone had been murdered on one of these busses. Not only murdered but also decapitated. It had been a schoolyard story that got passed around for a while, but it wasn't like it happened that often. There was no reason to lose my head over it. 

Pun intended. 

New passengers filed onto the bus one by one, slipping into seats beside one person or another. There weren't many people getting off at this stop, which meant I was likely going to have to move my backpack. 

A girl dropped her phone when she was waiting in line. It bounced across the floor on its aggressively thick case and landed just around my feet. I folded a little more in half to pick up the phone and offer it to her. She offered a curt nod and then sat beside me instead of joining back in the line. 

Hey, if I was going to have someone beside me, it might as well be someone I made a good first impression on. 

The girl dug in her purse and pulled out a small folding mirror, checking each of her eyes before snapping it shut and putting it in the purse. I gave her the once over. 

"In for a long ride?" I finally asked. 

"No idea," she answered. "You?"

"No idea either," I said, "just kinda."

"Feeling it out," she finished for me. 

There was a second between us, a flash of recognition where it clicked that she might be my- And then there was a literal flash. 

I had a twin.
