Little tiny balls of death are the best balls of death.   


So two small things!  


1. As opposed to 'everything was so blurry' there is likely a cleaner way to make that sentence happen. I mostly say that because the rain is his eyes ESTABLISHED that things will be blurry. Save yourself some words.
2.  Honestly, as much as the Pink Pajamas is fun, I think it might be a 'kill your darlings' thing. IMO it pulled me out wondering if Jack was always like that and I missed it. It felt like it clashed with the idea of the character in my head seeing as he also had a loaded shotgun in the room.
