"I'm simply suggesting that we might have given the humans too much-" the elder vampire paused as they surveyed the reaction across the dinner table, thanksgiving had been awakward the past couple of years. "rope on the leash, persey."

"Fuck that's a bad take," Alice commented just under her breath enough for everyone to hear it. 

"Alice," Eugine kicked his daugther's shin and caught a glare for it, but that was okay, he was just trying to ensure that everything didn't go to shit again this year.

"It's okay," Alfric, the Elder Vampire raised a single hand and shook his head, "she doesn't know what it was like. The humans they used to-" Alfirc chewed his words for a moment and wiped blood off his teeth with his tongue, "they used to know their place."

"Jesus Christ," Alice added as she rolled her eyes so far back they threatened to form a union and leave. 

"Alice!" Elma snapped at her daughter.

"It's a turn of phrase Mom I'm not calling him," Alice answered. 

"Don't say things like that at the table," Eugine added, and then after a moment, "listen to your mother."

"It's my table, this is-" Alice bit back her words and took a moment. She wasn't going to change any hearts or minds tonight. Grandpa Alfric had been around since 1483 and Mom & Dad were more progressive but were just going to say he was from a differnt time. "Can we talk about something else?"

Silence crept into the room, only broken by the occasional clink as someone put down on a goblet. Blood sat to the right of a glass of red and white wine at every place setting, but there were also choice veiny cuts left on ice in case someone wanted a sip from the tap. 

"Blood sure is good," Eugine commented to the air to help break the silence. 

"Thanks Dad," Alice answered in the classic, 'I'm not going to show my emotions' monotone of someone trying not to be pissed. 

Elma took a pointed sip and then considered the taste for a moment, "Were they a runner? It tastes like a very strong heart."

"No I think just vegan," Alice answered, "the hunter said they were really into their diets so I think it's more that than exersize" she trailed off. 

"Can't have been cheap," Eugine added. 

"Nooooooo-" Alice nodded along, "it was not, but it's thanksgiving so, ya know?" she put down her glass of blood after answering and silence dripped down from the ceiling again. Ice clattered in the bowl of fresh cuts as something melted enough for the entire array to shift. Alfric was simply staring down into their trio of glasses, not having taken a sip of blood since the conversation had changed topics. 

"I'm going to go check on dessert," Alice announced after a moment before pushing back out from her chair. 

"Oh my goodness there's more blood, are you fattening us up?" Eugine asked as he motioned to the mostly untouched cuts in the middle of the table. 

"It's a human dessert, don't worry," Alice corrected, "I'll be right back." She did walk to the kitchen, but everyone saw Alice pull out her phone instead of simply going to check on desert.

Once she was barely out of earshot, Alfric sighed, picked up his glass and took a long sip of the vegan blood. Eugine and Elma returned to their meals as well, but after the inital sip Alfric broke his silence. "I don't know what I did-" he scrunched scrunched up his face like he'd just eaten a lemon, "I didn't mean to upset her I-"

"I know Dad," Elma answered while barely pulling the goblet away from her lips. 

"No I don-" Alfric paused, "I do this every time and I don't want to make her-" he stopped again mid thought, "I'm going to go talk to her."

"Might not be the best idea Dad," Elma sighed, "just give her a minute and she'll be back."

"I-" Alfric pushed his chair out a touch, "I don't want her to have to 'cool off' before coming back to see me, it's a family dinner."

"Al," Eugine cut in, "let's just have a good rest of the night and we can just not bring up the human th-" Eugine stopped himself as all stood up and stalked into the kitchen. Eugine clicked his tongue three times and then turned to Elma ,"your Dad still doesn't care about my opinions."

"Not the time honey."

"It's been 130 years."

"Not the time."

In the kitchen Alice had pulled the cakes out of the oven two minutes ago but she was still leaning against the counter scrolling on her phone. Thanksgiving disasters was a trending hashtag and consdering nobody had responded to her text messages, she could at least look through other people's suffering and smile that her night wasn't going that poorly. 

Alfric walked into the kitchen and Alice didn't immidiately look up from her phone, instead taking a moment to hope that he was just going to pop in and out but once it was clear he was going to stick around Alice looked up from her phone to meet his eyes for a moment, doing her best to ignore how catastrophically wide the tie he'd had since the 70's was. "I'm sorry," Alfric said after a moment. 

"It's fine," Alice answered out of habit.

"No, it's not," Alfirc pointed out, "I don't want you to just need to tolerate me an-" he trailed off, "you and your parents are very different from me and-"

"I get it," Alice answered but she mostly went back to her phone instead of engaging. "like I said, it's fine."

"I don't want it to be just fine," Alfric took several steps back and found the counter across from Alice and leaned back against it. He crossed one leg over the other, with the toe of his dress shoe tapping the floor in contrast to Alice's white socks. "I want-" he took a second to consider words and then restarted, "I want us to enjoy our time together." 

"Yeah," Alice answered before putting her phone in her pocket, "I like seeing you so we don't need to do-" she motioned back and forth between them, "this." It was clear to anyone in the room,especially Alfric, that she wasn't telling the whole truth. She might have liked the idea of seeing her grandfarther, but those were mostly memories of a time before she'd been her own person. The last twenty years had been tense at best. 

"I want to be better," Alfric pointed out, "I want to-"

"and I don't particularly want to have this conversation tonight," Alice answered, "so it's fine."

"I-" Alfric swallowed his words.

"I just want to finish dinner and then-" she did a half shrug and then let her hands clap against her thighs, after a moment she did it again. 

"I can respect that," Alfric nodded and pushed himself off of the counter. He took several steps forward, originally for a hug but then thought better of it, "are these ready to go?" he ponited to the cakes. 

"They need a drizzle and I want to plate them," Alice answered, "but thank you."

"Okay," Alfric nodded for a moment before taking a step away from his granddaughter without invading her personal space. "I'll go make sure that your Mom and Dad aren't fighting over the place setting again."

Alice cracked half a smile and Alfric couldn't tell whether it was legitimate or a gimme, "thanks, be out in a minute."

Alfric left the room, ann Alice dipped her hand back into her pocket to grab her phone before pausing, and then turning to the counter to stand preparing the dessert.
