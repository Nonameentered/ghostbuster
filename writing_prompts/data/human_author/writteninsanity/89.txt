The tablet in front of me, in the middle of the museum, was bringing up two questions immediately. The first was, 'what the hell?' and the second was... a lot more complicated by formulating in my brain. 

"Is everything alright?" Inessa asked. My translater did its best to match the tone and words that she intended with her speech. "Your expression is similar to the human example of worry that your species provided us."

For half a second, I considered lying. I was here to be an introduction to humans for a species that was experiencing their uplift. This implied a human going far out of Council Controlled bounds. This implied breaking over several hundred codes. This im- The implications were something for the commanders to figure out.  "I can read it," I announced to the diplomat and small entourage of photographers that had been following us through the natural history museum. 

"My god, your translator, you informed us of much be incredibly p-" Inessa cut herself off as I rifled through my pocket for my notebook. Sure, it was old-fashioned to have something like this on a diplomatic rendezvous, but it was proving useful today. I shoved the notebook into her hand. "What is this?" she asked. 

"Look at the letters on the paper inside," I said. There was a brief moment of silence as the translators worked before she cracked open the notebook and her eyes scanned over the contents. She stared at it, and then up at the Tablet of Ashrika, and then back at my notebook. 

"I-"- she looked at it, "Ashr-"

"No," I cut that concept off before it got too far down the rabbit hole. I wasn't the person who wrote this. "Inessa," I took the notebook back from her shaking hands and folded it away in my pocket. "You're the only one here fitted with a translator. So I'm just speaking to you right now. Correct?"

She shook her head, but I knew that was affirmative for her. "The tablet is written in English. Specifically, English I can understand, which means, in human language terms, it can't be more than several hundred years old."

"The relic is older than any known writing we have from our people over tens of thousands of years of history." 

I did my best to smile like she'd shared an impressive fact with me as much as this should have been a private conversation. The present reporters would surely be able to understand what she was communicating to me. "I understand that," I clarified. "Right now, I can think of two options, and I need you to be calm for both of them, okay?"

Inessa shook her head again. 

"One. This isn't the artifact, but a human stole it at some point before our official first contact. If I can get access to this behind the barrier," I motioned to the tablet beyond the humming yellow screen, "we can scan it to see if it's a fake."

I couldn't translate much emotion off Fotuan faces, but pain and doubt were universal enough for me to read them. 

"Focus," I said. Inessa shook her head again and took half a breath to steel herself. "The other possibility is that this is legitimate and that there is something extraordinary going on with both of our languages. Maybe strikingly similar etymological roots." After half a second of Inessa fiddling with the headset we'd given her, I changed my wording around, "word history."

"Okay," she said. The translator made her voice shallow, like she could barely breathe. 

"Either way, it's best not to do this in front of people. If you agree with me there, we end the tour right now and meet with our supervisors before trying to figure this out. Otherwise, if you don't want to tell anyone yet, let's move onto the next thing in the list." 

"Right this way, then, sir," Inessa motioned for me to follow her, and I gave her a swift nod. First contact training had prepared me for moments when the train might derail, but it was never quite like this. People were always worried about guns getting pulled or accidentally offending a new species; it was never like this. 

I took one last look at the tablet as we rounded the corner. Etched deep in the rock was a long plea. 

*Please, I just want to go home.* 

*My name is Commander Ghel Raita* 

*Oxygen is running out.* 

*I'm out of ammo.*

*Nobody is going to find this.*

*Mom, Varli, I'm sorry,*

*Hey it’s me! Check out /r/Jacksonwrites for more stuff.*

*I enjoyed giving the alien agency instead of just being like HFY. Woo. Hope it’s interesting. I need to sleep.*
