I love the core concept of this, and the tieback line at the end. Chef's Kiss. Send compliments to the Kitchen. 

A small thing, but it's part of the tieback line. I think that 'Kidnap' is all but sacred duty.. isn't technically correct language. I think we're looking for 'gettig kidnapped' or 'kidnapee'.  Small things but small things matter in key lines!
