Let's be honest, everyone who says money can't buy happiness was never late with a rent cheque. In reality adding a fourth digit to my bank account always set off fireworks in my head. The kind of high that wouldn't be gone until I had to hide the debit card again.

I drummed my fingers on the corner store countertop as the clerk grabbed me the luckiest max millions he had behind the counter. Was it going to win? I didn't know! But *someone* had to win and it might as well be me. God the kinda vacations I could take with that much money in my bank account. Hell, what about the kinda vacations I could bring people on?

Course I didn't win, but imagine if I had?

I'd made plans with Velda to go out for drinks at Play, the hottest place on Instagram that neither of us could afford, but nobody needed to know that. The point was tonight I needed to look the part if I wanted to play it. 

The dress and shoes I ended up going out for didn't end up costing me too much, but they did a fantastic job of saying 'Hello, I'm Rich nice to meet ya."

After a quick stop back home to shower, dress up, and snatch my limited edition Ray-Bans off the craigslist IKEA nightstand, I was out on the town like I was supposed to be on a Saturday. 

Drinks at Play were five times the price of anywhere else I knew about, but it was the second hardest place to get into on Rideau street so they more than earned the paycheque. Plus these were my kinda people here. Three-piece suits, diamonds you could clock from across the room and heels made by Kate Fucking Spade.

Velda and I shouldn't have matched the crowd, but we certainly blended in. Faux diamonds glittered just as bright and the difference between H&M and Armani only really appeared after a wash. For two hours we mulled over a pair of glasses of wine and lived the way you're god-damn supposed to.

Then the cheque came to the table and I pointedly ignored the numbers before slipping my credit card into the hands of the waiter. The voice in the back of my head spoke up, asked me what would happen if I got sick.

I shut it down. Nobody else here was thinking about that sort of thing, and they were the people living life the right way. You didn't see them staying in on a Saturday to worry.  I could worry about that bullshit when I got sick. 

I grabbed my Ray-Bans off the table as the waiter handed back my card, and as soon as I had them on my smile became real again. "Come on, we're going to Tavern," I said to Velda as I started walking. 

The glasses, the drinks, the shoes. The lifestyle was expensive, but the confidence was complimentary. I could afford it all with a loan from tomorrow.
