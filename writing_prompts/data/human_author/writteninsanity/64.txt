As it turned out, first contact was devastatingly normal. You know how your friends all fit into archetypes in your head? Or the idea that there are only 4 stories ever told? Or the fact that EVERY coffee shop has that one guy working on a script in the corner?

Some things in the Universe are written in stone, and it turned out that humans had figured out all the alien archetypes a long time before we’d figured out how to get to the stars.

As a professional xenobiologist, this was immensely disappointing. We’d spent years crafting radical ideas about a non-sexually dimorphic species and what other genders could exist, and it turned out that we’d already had all the answers. He, she, they. That pretty much covered anything.

This led to the unfortunate reality that, to get research grants, we needed to focus on something the PEOPLE wanted to know.

Could you bang the Aliens?

That was my job now. To determine which alien secretions were harmful to human skin during periods of repeated friction. I also needed to figure out if any alien diseases could sexually species hop. Fortunately, most of the latter question was answered quickly.

And no, my job didn't mean I got to sleep with hot aliens. That would be unscientific of me.

Honestly, I should have seen this coming. Think about every movie you saw that involved aliens. If someone wasn’t getting eaten by an alien, they were eating out an alien; humanity just had two settings.

There was another hiccup with my job, though. Remember how I’d mentioned that humanity had predicted everything about the aliens a long time ago? It turned out that we’d nailed this one too. 

Pun intended.

We could sleep with almost any alien that we found attractive as a species. In fact, our biology was seemingly uniquely attuned to it. Like a creature summoned out of bad pulp pages in the Flash Gordon days, we were a reproductively flexible species.

All of that said, a job was a job. Having everything in space be exactly as expected was ironically unexpected when I’d taken up Xenobiology. Still, at least I had tons of anecdotes for parties now and a lot of weird texts from friends.
