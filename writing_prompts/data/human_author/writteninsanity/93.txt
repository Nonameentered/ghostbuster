Ahsa, Dread Empress of the Sands, loomed over her mighty kingdom and the Empire that surrounded it. Her beautifully terrible throne, stained and coloured with the blood of her enemies, traitors and challengers, was empty on the far side of the room as she stared at her house banner on the wall. The banner flew all across the known world, representing fear, loyalty and power to every grovelling citizen that stared up at it each morning.

The sandstone floor of her throneroom was staining from the oozing blood of a servant who had dared speak out of turn in her presence. Not only that, but he had compared her brilliant banner of authority to a simple cow.

Asha had killed for less; in fact, she often killed simply because she was hungry and didn't want to wait for her proper meal, but the Empress of the Sands hadn't really killed the servant because he was speaking out of turn. She'd killed him and splattered him across the now-silent throne room because he was completely right.

When someone looked at the banner during her rule, since the days long ago when the sun had chosen her for power and divinity, they might have seen a simple cow. In fact, now that someone had mentioned it, Asha couldn't fathom someone seeing her banner as anything else but a meek and plump cow ready for slaughter in worship to the sands and those that lay beneath it.

In fact, she couldn't even manage to see the banner as a bull. It was very clearly a cow as opposed to an abstract design representing the terror of facing death in the face of the ascended like Asha.

To Asha's right, one of her most trusted advisors, the Vizier Molsa, approached, nearly floating across the tiles in his best attempt to be quiet. He stopped short of Asha as she glared holes into her family's banner. He opened his mouth to speak but then thought better of interrupting her Imperial thoughts.

"Speak your wisdom Molsa," Asha hissed, her voice as scalding as the noon sun.

"Empress, the words of a servant mean nothing in this time of great opportunity for our Empire," he began, "I shall have him replaced, and we may continue the meeting," he motioned back to the war table in the centre of the room. "Should you wish it, of course," he added onto the end of his suggestion, bowing low.

"Vizier," Asha answered, "does the Banner of the Empire of the Sun look like a cow?"

"Of course not m-" Molsa began, but the searing hand of the sun was suddenly upon his throat. Asha, chosen of the rays, gripped her most trusted advisor, and his life faltered for half a moment in her fingers.

"The truth or your life Molsa," she commanded.

"I-" Molsa's breathing quickened as his eyes darted between the God Empress and her family's banner. It did- Of course, it looked like a cow, but who would ever tell her that- Molsa tried to swallow past Asha's burning nails but couldn't. The truth. "Perhaps from a certain angle," he said as quietly as he could so others could never dream of hearing him.

Asha dropped her Vizier and turned her attention to one of her generals. The man squeaked as his armour suddenly began to superheat as he was wearing it. The victor of a thousand battles dropped to his knees and raised his hands in prayer and worship to the Dread Empress of the Sands. "Ghalta," Asha's voice shone through the throne room like a sunbeam through a window at the lack sparks of sunset, "does my banner look like a cow to you?"

"A mighty bull," Ghalta lied as he felt his skin burn through his gambeson. The banner was unmistakably a cow, the kind that a small child milked in the most peaceful village in the core kingdom. He couldn't say that to her, though. He did not know what the Vizier had said to escape the madness of his queen, but he was sure it was not that her banner was that of a cow.

Ghalta's screams echoed throughout the palace as he burned within the prison of his armour, unable to hold his hands on it long enough to rip it off his skin. The man that had been loyal for so many years had shown his true colours in the last moments, willing to lie to the Chosen of the Sun because he thought it was what he wanted to hear.

"How long," Asha began as the screamed finally faded, and the spirit of Ghalta flew off to the desert to join the White Riders, "how long have you known it was a cow?" Asha asked her Vizier.

"My Empress, please."

"Speak the truth, Vizier, before I summon my patron here to burn this entire kingdom along with us and that cow banner."

"I-" Molsa dropped to his knees, staining his brilliant gold robes with the blood of the original servant who had spoken up. "It has always been a cow, my great merciful Empress, I feared telling you unprompted, but it-" Molsa could barely fathom the words he was saying to the Dame of Daybreak, "it's completely a cow."

The room grew scorching hot with the pounding heat of the Sun Soul within Asha. She stepped towards the Vizier, who winced away, but stopped short of him, leaning down and caressing the cheek of the servant boy that had spoken up and mentioned her banner's flaw.

The banners around the kingdom ignited into a brilliant white flame, flashing into ash within an instant, a terrifying reminder of the power of the Sun. Asha's eye glowed with the brilliant fire of a star, and fire flickered from her fingers deep into the soul of the boy she'd scorched from the earth. "A champion of Truth fell today," she whispered into his ear warming ear, "let him rise as we conquer the worlds again, in the name of a brighter truth. One that isn't totally a cow."

*The goal here was to play everything else as far from 'it's a cow' as I could because the premise I chose to run with here was unfathomably stupid.*
