I wasn't a God that people wrote about or heard about, or even passed on vocal tradition about. Back in my homeland, my followers had found out that it was easier and more socially acceptable to join a Dionysian cult of madness and wine than it was to have a shrine up to me. Eventually, my lack of followers had led to banishment to the 'new World' a place that wouldn't know about me for several hundred years, if ever. The people that were here now had their own Gods divorced from Zeus's divine pantheon empowered by their belief the same way that Gods like Dread Persephone had joined our ranks on Olympus. 

I spent most of my days with one of those Gods born of belief, and she was fading. A mother of the Everglades to a people who had moved on, and wouldn't be back until long after she was dead. I knew that she was going to die, and I knew that I wasn't because of the divine spark of my father substituting for my belief. Her people would come back and make a new God, and then they would shed blood and tears when humans made the same pilgrimage that I did to this new world. Eventually, I'd have a profound effect on this place, but right now, I was spending another quiet day in the Everglades. 

"Your father threw you out then?" she asked me. She didn't have a name aside from being recognized as the mother of this land, but I wasn't about to call her Mom. 

"Not just him," I corrected as I watched the alligator in the water in front of me patiently wait for something to come within striking distance. "whole family."

"Why?" she asked. She'd asked the same questions every time I showed up in this part of history, and I wasn't sure if it was because she was old enough that she forgot, or she knew that I wanted to talk about it.

"Because they're a bunch of Elitist pricks," I sighed. They called me the God of Rednecks, which wasn't a term she'd even here in her time on this planet, but that wasn't actually my title. "You know because I'll offer someone a can of beer before I go to a vineyard-" I stopped myself before I needed to explain some of those things. "I'm not fancy- well - I'm pretty fancy by merit of being a God, but the kind of people who would worship me, or fall within my domain aren't. They work hard, and don't subscribe to the same rules that a lot of upper-class economic cultures do, so people are going to look down on them for hundreds of years before they realize that Classism, the same thing that my family is exhibiting right now, is pretty fucked up." 

"That doesn't sound very right," she pointed out. 

"It's not," I sighed, "and I say all of this-"

"Every week," she cut in. So she did obviously remember the other times I'd been here. 

"Yeah," I said, "well it's a lot to be out here. Not like they know about me in the future. Hell, not many people even directly pray to my Father anymore. Couple of new Gods show up and really shake things around."

"Pity," the mother said. 

"Well yeah, it doesn't save us," I shrugged, "even a lot of the things said by the biggest God on the planet should have helped the kinda people I work with, but their worship doesn't seem to alleviate the or raise them up. Hell, half of the time it seems like a predatory belief meant to pull money out of people who already don't have enough of it."

"Money?" she asked. 

"A number for how many things you have. A stupid number mind you but- it's around for a long time and it messes up a lot of things," I took a big sigh. "Fuck it all boils down to money issues and all of that. Education, societal trends, cultures. All of it revolves around money. The upper class weaponized an idea, and then when that idea stops being as profitable they can easily abandon it by introducing a shift in legislation and proper culture that shies away from that sort of thing, but what happens to the people who don't have dinner parties?"

"This is a rhetorical question." the mother responded. 

"They get left behind, because their education isn't as airtight, and the same people making the new rules are the people that are trying to bleed them dry every day, so in this stew of lowered chance for change and slight resentment they end up the butt of the fucking joke." 

"Is it funny?"

"No, it's not. And maybe they deserve part of it because it takes a staggeringly long time for everyone on this rock to figure out that everyone should be treated fairly. They can be unfair and cruel to people that are different from them the same way that others look down on them for not speaking proper English, a language that won't exist for hundreds of years at this point, and is so butchered and twisted over the course of its history that it's really about Eight languages by the end." 

"You know," the mother pointed out, "you never get much further than this in our conversation before we simply sit and wait for the Alligator to find some lunch."

"I know," I said. 

"There are many wars, though all ages. Some of them are between brothers and sisters, some of them are between countries, some of them between skins and some others between classes. Every war also ends." 

I snorted at that. "How do you know that?" 

"You told me once, when you'd had too many of the Bud Lites that you bring from a later time." 

"Okay," I took a deep breath.

"You told me much more about the future than you should have," she said. 

"Probably," I admitted.

"Do you remember what I told you?" she asked. 

"You told me that it could all work as long as everyone remembered that everyone has a mother, and everyone deserves a mother's kindness, which means giving it too."

"You're a good listener."

"You're a great one then," I said, "I just wish it didn't take so long for all of them to learn that lesson." 

 "There are many temptations for them not to be kind," she pointed out, "which results in many of the things you speak of, but you, and me? We can be kind, and eventually, they will find it out as well."

I chuckled at that and sat down at my spot on the riverbank beside the mother. "Beer?" I offered. 

"Definitely not."

"Suit yourself," I nodded and cracked open the cold one I summoned before waiting for the Aligator to catch something.
