There was a cackle outside and three sharp knocks on the door. I almost lept out of my comfy spot on the couch and double checked that I'd lit all the right candles. Did I have the right songs in the queue? Was- whatever. She was at the door and I had to answer before she blew it off it's hinges again. 

"Hey," I greeted to the young looking witch standing on my stoop with a furrowed brow and a drawn wand. After a moment of keeping comsposure she shattered into giggles in her attempts to keep the frown going. "How are you?" I asked, my voice came out like a song. 

"Fine," she hissed at me before holding out her hands expecting a hug, I delievered. 

"Inside," I said as I ushered her off the street and into my living room. Once she was inside I held out my arms to present the room. "Not bad right?" I asked, "Dinner is in the oven to keep warm. Thought you'd be a little later."

"You made dinner?" Margaret put her broomsitck and wand down by the door to surveyed the room. There were definitely too many candles, but she didn't mention it. 

"Well yeah it's an important day," I pointed out, "and... you know, everyone had a tough year this year and I figured that extended to witches."

"Tell me about it," she huffed as she took off her boots, "supply lines man, you can't get a good newt unless you're willing to wait a month and a half."

"Can't fly anywhere," I commented. 

"Well I can," Margaret pointed out, knocking on her broom quickly before righting herself, "but yeah, whole thing," the witch put a hand around my waist, "what about you?"

"This year or since you last saw me?" I mused.

"Both?" Margaret suggested. 

"I mean you know the whole stay at home stuff drove me bonkers," I pointed out as I nodded for her to follow me toward the couch, "but last few weeks have been.. ya know, fine."

"Work's okay?"

"Been distracted," I admitted. 

"By-"

"You."

"You're drumb," she pointed out, she waved around at all of the candles and finally noticed the bottle of champagne. "This is dumb." 

"I put a lot of effort into this," I said with mock pain in my voice. 

Margaret locked eyes with me for a moment, sqinted then relented. "Fine. Thank you."

"I don't do it for the thanks," I said. 

"You're the worst."

"Well aware," I anwered, "wine?"

"Sure," Margaret sank a little deeper into the couch and undid one of the three clasps on her cloak. At least she had started relenting a little bit on appearances. 

"Red or white?" I asked while I made my way to the kitchen.

"The champagne," she answered. 

"That's for later," I corrected and stopped at the counterspace beside the fridge, "Red or white?"

"You know what I like."

"Cab sav in Red and-" I paused to open the fridge and pull out the white wine, "this bullshit."

"It's good wine."

"For a frat party," I sighed as I unscrewed the top of the white. 

"I like it."

"You have bad tastebuds. There should be a potion for that."

"I'll make one for you so you learn to appreciate affordable wine," she countered. 

"Oh we're casting spells on me again?" I asked as I pulled out the glasses and put and bendy straw in hers, "How'd that go last time?"

"I'm getting wine out of it," she pointed out. Margaret had sat up on the couch and was reading the label on the champagne, she she didn't see me shrug. She had a point. I wasn't mad about the results. 

"Here," I offered her the wine and she grabbed the glass before noticing the straw. 

"W-"

"The other option was a sippy cup."

"I'm not going t-"

"It's a white couch," I said before reaching over and pointedly bending the straw toward her. "Enjoy."

"Thanks," she whispered. 

"Welcome," I answered. 

Margaret put the bottle of champagne back and started focusing on the wine, glaring at me as she used the bendy straw. After a minute she crossed her legs up properly on the couch, and I could hear clinking from her belt. 

"Potions?" I asked 

"Eh," she shrugged, "Mom would kill me if she knew I wasn't trying so I just grabbed some stuff."

"Anything interesting?" I asked. Usually I'd get fake offended at the fact that she wasn't trying to force me to make a baby anymore, but it didn't need to be a thing every time she mentioned it. 

"One of them is like 80% booze."

"What's it do?"

"Courage potion."

"You need that tonight?" I asked. 

Margaret snorted and carefully put down the wine glass before she shook too much from giggling. "Why would I be nervous around you?"

"I'm your biggest failure," I pointed out. 

"Oh no, the kinda immortal still-not-magical man," 

"Win some you lose some," I pointed out before putting my wine down beside hers. After half a moment I took the bendy straw out of her glass and put it in mine. She was either going to read that as me trusting her, or wanting the bendy straw becuase I'm 57 in a 24 year old body going on 6. 

Either one was right. 

"What's the champaigne for?" 

"Eh I have plans," I answered with my best impression of being dismissive. Honestly it wasn't my greatest work, and I could tell from Margaret's sly smile that she read right through it.

"Important plans?" 

"Been a long time coming," I admitted. 

"Is it dumb?" she asked. 

"Very," I confirmed. 

"Nervous?" she asked. 

"Well you did spend ten years trying to kill me."

"S'different now," she snorted. 

"Yeah," I confirmed, "it really really is." After half a moment consdiering drinking the rest of my wine I continued, "Can I grab that courage potion?"

"We could just do shots," she answered.

"Uh I think that-" ugh, no plan survives contact with the enemy. I stood up. "Look I-"

Margaret stared at me for a moment before reaching into her cloak and pulling out a small red vial. "Looks like you need it," she said. 

"I know our thing is weird," I said without taking the potion from her hand yet, "and like I understand that you need things that I don't provide and-"

Margaretâ€™s eyes flicked from mine to my left pocket and then back. 

"and I uh- dammit. Can I?" I reached for the potion. 

"Here," she offered it to me, "but if it helps, the answer is yes."

I beamed before drinking the potion. Of course it was yes, it had probably been yes for months. I knew that the curse, it had been the biggest mistake of her life as a witch, and the best thing to happen to both of us. 

You didn't need a ring to prove that.
