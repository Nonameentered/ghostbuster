"Ms Anthonies, the Mayor of Chicago is on the line again about the flooding of Lower East side in the-"

Ms. Anthonies raised a hand to stop Janet and she understood that I didn't need more context. Neptunus had tried to catch a falling plane with the Chicago River earlier in the month and even though it had been a dramatic flex of their hydrokinesis, they weren't able to hold onto the entire river for very line. "Transfer him to a base agent and tell them to circle back to me once we remind them about the premiums, okay?"

"Yessir," Janet said with her finger already on the key to pick up the phone. Honestly thank goodness for her, Anthonies needed someone with a decent head on their shoulders around here and she's at least as close as they were going to get.

See the sticky thing about the superpowered is that they're a bit elitest. Supes were under the impression that the great powers they had meant that they had unique responsiblities and that  a standard insurance agent wasn't going to be able to help them. The staff all needed to be powered, and interested in insurance.

It wasn't a deep hiring pool.

Just as Ms. Anthonies was passing the desk Janet pointed to the phone again, likely getting an earful from the Mayor as she did. Anthonies shook her head and motioned to wipe her schedule. She cocked her head, Anthonies pointed down the hallway to the personal meeting rooms. Janet nodded.

Ms Anthonies double checked her tie in the mirror halfway down the hallway and moved it slightly off centre. She needed to look like she was stressed, but still keeping it together for this meeting. Heroes were all about presentation and Sherry Anthonies was capeless, but no less a crusader.

Behind the closed maple doors at the end of the hall, Ashes, dressed in grey lycra and body armor had a marble orb from a sculpure and was considering dropping it. There was a chance it would land with a disspointing thump, but on the other hand it might shatter that certainly would have been worth the exasperation from any incoming insurance agents. What were the chances of each outcome? How likely was she to get mable shards scattered acoss the floor, glittering and-

The door opened, Ashes didn't really move to put down the ball, instead turning it over in her hand again before taking one step to turn toward the door. She didn't smile when Ms. Anthonies stepped into the room. 

"This is backwards," Ashes mused, "I'm not usually the first one in here."

"You're not usually on time," Athonies pointed out. Ashes shrugged. It was good to be a villain in all aspects of life, inlcuding scheduling. After leaving the villain a beat for a verbal response Anthonies continued, "you went too far."

"Right to business," Ashes chuckled before putting the orb in her hand pointedly down on the wrong part of the sculpture. She scanned Anthonies for a moment for a reation and, upon finding nothing, "Where?"

"What do you mean where?" Anthonies asked, she motiond toward a chair, Ashes didn't move. "There was only one place."

"Well I was only getting paid for San Francisco, but-" Ashes took two step and pulled the head chair of the table out by wrapping her ankle around one leg, "I have hobbies."

"I don't care about the ones that I didn't hire you to-"

"Feel like those still cost you money," Ashes pointed out as she took the head table.

Anthonies watched Ashes put her feet up on the desk and took a deep breath. "I'm not going to police everything you do, and I'm not going to pay you for work you'd do for free."

Ashes ran her tongue along her front teeth and looked down away from Anthonies. 

"Too far," Anthonies continued. 

"What?"

"I wanted you to raise their premiums by, and I fucking quote, 'Causing indentured heroes to cause destruction beyond San Francisco Bay's deductables to cause-"

"A raise in premiums," Ashes finsihed for her. After half a second she shrugged, "I'm pretty sure I got that covered."

"Do you remember your job?" Anthonies asked. She was trying and failing to keep an even tone to avoid getting baited into an argument with a professional pain-in-the-ass.

"You just quoted me," Ashes pointed out. 

"Part of your contract," Ms. Anthonies stalked over to the up till now ignored contract beside the sculpture that Ashes had been playing with and picked it up, "is not costing us half a billion dollars in damages to the Golden Gate bridge." Anthonies tossed the contract so it landed generally slapped the table in front of Ashes. 

The villain reached forward and flipped the frong page over on the contract but didn't make an effort to read that. "That seems oddly specific."

"Ashes," Athonies said, "I know you're not a dumbass when it comes to this sort of thing." Ashes frowned at the word dumbass. "You know that landmarks are off-fucking-limits."

"Guess I forgot."

"We comp landmarks," Anthonies explained, "becuase we tell you not to fuck with them. Then the cities are happy that we WOULD pay of the Bridge if someone flew through it, but we never have to. It's a win-win."

"Not for me," Ashes started. 

"You win becuase we pay you to do whatever you would have done anyway."

"I feel like you're leading into not paying me for San Francisco," Ashes said. 

"No," Anthonies finally pulled out a chair and dragged the contract back toward her, "we're paying you beucase we're professionals, but you're a contractor, and contractors can be let go at any time without notice becuase we're incorperated in an at-will state," Anthonies flipped to page 273 and spun the countrct back around to show off the bolded text. 

Ashes sat up.

"Good luck finding someone to hire you Ashes," Anthonies said as she pulled a pen out of her pocket. "You're blacklisted."

"You don't have to do that," Ashes answered like she didn't care.

"No, but I'm going to," Anthonies said, "becuase I don't need to dela with a b-lister like you when kids like Echo-Terror are asking for half the rate."

"He's a hack," Ashes pointed out.

"And you're unemployed."

Ashes persed her lips like she'd chomped a lemon and then took a deep breath. "Job was boring anyway," she commented. 

Anthonies didn't blink. 

Ashes stood up from the table and pulled her death ray off her hip. For half a second he considered poniting it toward Anthonies before snapping it to the far wall and blowing a hole in the side of the building to the alleyway where her bike was waiting. 

"Real mature."

"Maturity isn't really the point of villainy," Ashes answered and walked over to the hole in the wall. 

"There was a door like 3 feet to the left."

"Was," Ashes said pointedly before dropping off the side of the building, and into somewhat of a financial crisis.
