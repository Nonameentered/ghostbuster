"I mean, at least they aren't saying that they're looking for a rockstar," I pointed out to Val over the phone as I waited for the bus. I'd left fifteen minutes early for the interview but the but was three minutes late, and the app said it had picked me up two minutes ago. 

"Is that so bad?" She asked, clearly distracted. Then again, I did agree to let her keep working while she claimed me down. 

"That's a classic way to say they're not going to pay you enough for the number of extra hours they want you to pull." I started down the street at the oncoming car and lack of bus. 

"I thought that was what being a 'team player' meant."

"They mean the same thing," I clarified. It was going to rain soon, and I wasn't wearing waterproof robes. 

"So is being a rockstar just more trendy?"

"Yeah, I think so," I answered. The bus came around the corner. Thank the maker. 

"Hey," Val said in that 'I'm completely swapping the topic way, "What did you say the job asked for again?"

"Experience with Necromancy and Demonology," I said before taking out one of my headphones and pulling my hood down, so I wasn't rude to the bus driver. 

"Isn't your degree in evocation?" 

"I have a minor in necro." 

"No, you don't," Val retorted. True. 

"I was only like two credits short," I answered before conjuring coins from my arcane realm to pass to the bus driver. She nodded and accepted the gold before handing me a transfer ticket. 

"What about demonology?"

"I dated Regnar for like two years," I pointed out, "he was a minor demonologist for the City."

"I thought he was provincial," Val pointed out. There was more noise on her end of the conversation now; she was clearly either cleaning or getting a snack for the call. So much for work. 

"Nah, city." 

"Did he teach you anything?"

"Uh." I started as I found a seat that wasn't too covered in year-old blood and Draco-powder, "I looked at some of his stuff sometimes."

"You know nothing about Demonology then?" 

"He talked about it a lot." 

"He also talked about his 'business idea,'" Val said with audible air-quotes, "a lot, and I don't remember what that was." 

"I think it was a mobile tome..." I answered and pulled my phone out again. I was just five minutes behind schedule. "Something about speaking in runes as opposed t-"

"Emojis," Val cut me off. 

"Yeah, those, and... I think you could like buy three of them so that it was like your signature?" I plunged deep into the depths of my brain for that one. Honestly, the biggest thing about Regnar that I remembered was the fact that he had my damn cast iron cauldron still and never responded to my drunk texts about it. 

"Yeah, if you don't remember that, you don't remember the demonology stuff."

"If we're fair, it was a *really* bad idea, Val." 

"So is demonology as a major," she pointed out. Couldn't argue there. Most people got into demonology to lock down a succubus, attempt to settle down and end up as a pretty little trophy caster for someone in the nine-hells. "But you've totally got this. Just say that you're always cautious about your summonings."

"Fair enough," I said. I pulled my crystal out of my pocket and dismissed my call with Val off to the side to see if I could find Regnar on CommUne. I was pretty sure I remembered his user name. 

"Do you know what the position is for?" 

"Uh," I said as I tried two different options for usernames I'd had in the back of my head.  The first was somewhere in Valor Reach; the second didn't exist on the platform. "Disrupting an industry." 

"A startup?"

"Yeah."

"What are they paying you?" she asked. 

"Uh," I started as the bus stopped and two vampires took way too long trying to explain the whole 'we need to be welcomed on' concept. "I don't know."

"Stock options don't buy groceries." Val pointed out, "make sure it's actual money."

"Yeah yeah," I answered as the bus kept moving, "I know, no more internships."

"So the internship position open today does have some pretty big demands attached,' the Succubus who was conducting my interview began while looking over my resume on a freshly printed scroll. "We're really looking for a rock star to make sure that it's a success." 

"I guess those bard credits are going to pay off," I said while trying my best to avoid a sigh. If this was the kind of job I wasn't qualified for, what the hell was I going to find out in the wild?

"You know, I didn't pick you as a bard on the way in, but I can totally see it," she commented without taking her eyes off my 'skills' section. Had a printed off the copy that I'd added Demonology to? Did I remember to add 'summoning' under hobbies. 

"Two credits and a year on the improvised casting team for Mina Bastion College."

"You had time for all of that, a degree in evocation, a minor in necromancy and some demonology credits?" she asked; for a second, I was worried it was a real question, "I wish I had your work ethic back in college."

"Y-" I started but then decided not to be racist about it."

"Dad's an elf, grew up surface-side," she clarified, "weird I know. How was Mina Bastion?"

"Big," I answered, "it was an," I paused for a second to find the right words to use in an interview, "interesting and exciting city, but it wasn't quite a good match for me, so I moved here to Neocordia."

"That was," the Succubus lowered my resume and revealed her nametag, Morticia, "diplomatic, you might be a proper demon-binder after-all." 

"I have experience with the theory of demon binding but-"

"I don't know, honey; you've already bound me-" Morticia sang before leaning in. A moment later, her eyes unclouded, and she snapped back to sitting completely upright. "Sorry, sorry, would you mind? I'm out of my prescription."

"Uh yeah, uh," I went over the internet articles I'd read last night about common demonology spells. Sin sealing was one of the most common. Did I do that with my right hand or my... it had to be the right-hand, right? I'd done it right last night, and I was a terrible shot with my left. I raised my right hand.

"Woah, I don't need something that strong," she waved my right hand away, "I'm mostly wrapped up here. A reverse cast would knock me into next week." 

"Sorry, I misread the situation," I said while pulling up my left hand to trace the symbols. Goddammit, I'd nailed sin unsealing last night. At least she'd thought I'd been trying for something more complicated. That or she'd totally noticed but was being nice considering I was about to cast magic on her. 

"It's okay." 

I snapped my fingers to cast and spell and pink sparks cascaded from my fingertips before skittering along the desk and up Morticia's skin. They buried themselves inside of her and she took a deep sigh of relief. "Does that feel better?" I asked. 

"Thanks," she said, "sorry about that. It's embarrassing but I've been working on some projects here and haven't had time to get to the apothecary recently. I-" a shiver ran up the succubus' spine and somewhere a teenage boy died happy. "Maker, your magic is the coldest thing I've ever felt."

"Sorry, evocation."

"No no, it makes sense I'm just going to need to grab my shawl later. I have it upstairs, they try to keep the office warm enough for everyone but all of guys complain if I make it hot enough for me. I'm freezing like all of the time." 

"Yeah I get that," I nodded along. She probably had it pretty rough considering her body was made to be wrapped in literal fire. 

"Okay now that we have all of that squared away," she started, "I have a couple of questions I want to ask, just trying to get to know a little bit about you as a person okay? We like to consider this a life story as opposed to an interview." 

"Sounds awesome," I said. It would be a breath of fresh air after so many of the same questions from interviewers in a row. 

"So, where do you see yourself in about five years?"

I will likely be back to wrap this up a little later, I just need to sleep right now! /r/jacksonwrites
