Special Agent Charles Ashton stopped himself halfway through the door to Victoria’s office to ensure that his tie was prim and proper.

“I thought I had your next lecture penned in for Thursday,” Vic mused from behind her computer. Her voice was like a snake, always safer to assume it was venomous.

“I needed-“

“Great,” she cut the agent off, “I can do it now, I guess. Reminding you that your title is *secret* agent really is my favorite thing to do over and over again. Sit down.”

Agent Ashton opened his mouth to speak but Vic pointed at the lone seat across from her to shut him up. Ashton complied.

“It’s remarkable how you manage to fuck up the simplest assignments.”

“It got messy and-“

“I could have explained the plan I sent you in *crayon*,” Vic hissed.

“HR has asked you not to insult me like this.”

“How would you like me to insult you Agent? I take requests.” Vic waited but Ashton simply frowned and let her continue. “See, the thing is that HR didn’t lose track of a-“ she picked up a pen for the express purpose of tapping her chin with it. “What was it again?”

“A hydrogen bomb.”

“Right! How could I forget?” she tossed the pen. “Wait, I didn’t. You did. Now the Russians have classified atomic technology, which I’m sure they truly appreciate. I hear they’re taking *donations*.” Vic leaned in with a slight smirk, and Agent Ashton was confident that, had she opened her mouth, she would have revealed vampire fangs.

Ashton cleared his throat. “I’m taking a leave of absence to go on a vacation.”

“Oh!” Vic perked up, “A ‘*vacation*’ got it.” The air quotes were audible.

“Pardon,” Ashton said, “an actual vacation.”

“Yes, a secret agent holiday that just happens to be at the same time as the… G20 Summit in Paris.”

“I’m not going to Paris.”

“Ohoho,” Vic cooed, “where are you going then? Congo? Central African Republic? I hear they’re *lovely* this time of year.”

“Aren’t there civil wars going on at both those places?”

“Must have slipped my mind. What’s the alias on those tickets?”

“Vic I’m taking a proper vacation,” Ashton insisted.

Victoria snorted.

“I’m serious. I need to take some time for myself so-“

“Time for yourself?” Vic repeated like the concept offended her. “Don’t worry, I’m sure the KGB will wait while you waste time in Aruba.”

Ashton took a deep breath, began to say something and then took several more breaths instead. “Vic, I really, truly need this time.”

For the first time in the conversation, Victoria looked into Ashton’s eyes instead of glaring through them. “Unfit for service,” she said, too quiet to be banter, “two months suspension with pay. Alias to be provided for the duration.” Vic relayed the command into her computer.

“Thank you,” Ashton whispered.

“Agent, if you don’t come back here and die for something after this,” Vic sighed, “I’ll send your replacement to kill you."
