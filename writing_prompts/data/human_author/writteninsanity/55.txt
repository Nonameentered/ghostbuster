Humanity was pretty disappointed when it turned out that the mysterious visitors from outside the Solar System were God Damn humans. Maybe it was myopic to expect the first civilization humans ran into to be mysteriously mammalian alien babes. Perhaps it was presumptuous to presume they'd find an honourable but gruff warlike species to be our friends, but come on.

Humans imagined the stars and then found Dave from accounting up there. Dave from accounting was fine, but he was both uncreative and the most mundane example of a human someone could use. Offence intended Dave.

At first, it had been an annoyance, a vague 'Oh, you're different than I expected.' The kind of reaction reserved for first dates when someone had been ambitious with the Instagram filters on their tinder profile. Eventually, that vague disappointment morphed into resentment and resentment bred the single conclusion for Flat-Earthers and people who wanted a more exciting space.

Those human bastards were probably hiding the cool aliens from Earthlings.

All of the mundane lifestyles and snore-worthy lectures humans got about the stars were a ruse. A ploy so that the new humans -Newmans- could horde all of the cool aliens to themselves. It made sense, if someone had access to all of the cool aliens, why would they bother sharing with someone? Humans were barely willing to share a meal, let alone sick sci-fi bullshit.

The Earthlings hatched a plan, simple but devious. They would kill their newly acquired planet-mates for being late on the rent, and take off into the stars on their ship, finding all the Flash Gordon fun they ever could on the way, after all, they'd been looking for an excuse to leave their hometown for years, how different could a planet be?

Once the humans were on the ship, they did the obvious thing and headed to the first planet that was marked as illegal. After all, if Dave from Accounting: The Race was hiding something, they would have tried to hide it under red flags and tape. Daves listened to that kinda bullshit.

There were humans on the illegal planet too! What a ripoff. They were all just a little bit different from Dave though, pushier, more demanding.

The humans from Earth didn't realize what they'd done until it was too late. They'd been delighted when the new-new-humans ordered them to 'Take me to your leader' because it had at least been a sci-fi reference.

Of course, 'Take me to your leader' is the Sci-Fi version of 'I need to speak to the Manager.'
