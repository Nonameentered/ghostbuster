So!  


1. I brought this up in the in TT, but Police Officers are primarily going to use their last names during a lot of interactions. You can cut a bunch of words but referring to them as Officer Smith and Wesson (It also hits the pun!)   

2. I do think there needs to be some thing with structure. If you want too break it up more and still have it be swappable, you MIGHT be able to have characters say specific numbers or something that makes it even MORE clever without marring the reading experience.
