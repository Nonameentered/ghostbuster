Black candles flickered, and the smell of crushed rosemary suffocated my basement. There wasn’t a line of chalk out of place or a drop of blood in the wrong vial. I’d arranged everything meticulously. Months of preparation culminated tonight.

I opened the Codex Altriceria, and the pages whipped themselves into a frenzy, revealing the Blood of the Echoing Past. The other casters called me a fool for trying this. They’d whispered that I was mad for preparing the sacrifices, but at the stroke of midnight, I’d prove them wrong; I wasn’t willing to pay the price for not trying.

The grandfather clock upstairs called out to the void, and I answered. “Aldi Domina Hortacio Den Vani Derath,” I started, and the candles in the room stumbled, unsteady. The clock continued to ring out as I persisted with my incantation.

Darkness crept into the corners of the room, and ink coated my eyes. Cold seeped between my fingers, and shadows dripped from my maw. I was beyond. I was between. I was-

“Daddy?” Liv’s voice cut through the infinite black.

“Sweetie!” I greeted instead of continuing the incantation. The entropy of darkness retreated, and my eyes cleared. “Are you okay?”

“Yes,” I confirmed, “is it important?”

“Mhm,” she nodded.

I pulled my dark hood back and walked over to her. Her eyes were blurry, and she had a huge yawn for a tiny girl. “What’s wrong?” I asked.

“I had a bad dream,” she said.

I scooped her up in a hug, snatching her off the stairs and holding her tight against my acolyte robes. “Oh, Sugar,” I whispered into her ear. I could feel the rattling of her weak lungs against me as she pressed her nose into my chest. “I’m right here.”

Light seeped back into the room as the candles steadied and burned bright. The Codex Altriceria snapped shut, and vials of blood stopped boiling. I squeezed my little Sugar Snap, and she smushed Bunny.

“Can I sleep with you?” Liv asked in her little muffled voice. I stared back at the room. Weeks of preparation had gone into this attempt. I was going to have to at least wait for the next new moon, and that was if I could replace all the consume-

“Of course Sugar Cookie,” I said before carrying my little girl off to bed. If I could bargain with dark forces for her, they could wait.
