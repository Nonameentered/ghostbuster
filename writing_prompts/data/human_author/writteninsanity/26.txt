You know, not to be a super big downer but until fairly recently the answer would have been 'not much' for about the past two years. I've unfortunately been very hot and cold on writing and the cold tends to come when I put too much expectation on a certain result from the writing instead of trying to get something down on paper. 

Writing for me has a big tie to my mental health, and when I'm able to write it really helps. In the end the thing I like most about writing is 'getting it out of my head.' I can really vividly picture scenes and recite what I want to write for an idea almost verbatim before I've put pen to paper (or fingers to keys). A find a lot of ideas very sticky, so it feels wonderful to get them down somewhere and feel like I've translated an obsessive thought into something tangible.
