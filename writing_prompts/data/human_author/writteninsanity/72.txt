Hey I said some stuff during the campfire, but additional thing :)  


1. I love the idea so this might seem nitpicky. 

But there are some places in the early parts that we discussed being a little long where the character is describing her actions. An example is " Our legs swung as we chittered. Green-gold dust rained from our quivering wings, sprouting fresh clovers at the treeâ€™s base. " When in first person, things are VERY normal for the MC. Simplifying those actions to what the character would see in themselves work.   


Alternatively, it can be good to speak about how an action makes the character feel as opposed to just speaking about the action to break those up. Do the characters care about the clovers? Do they need to clear them out later? Is that annoying? Along those lines. I think that's why the latter half works so well, because he here how they feel about the actions that are happening as opposed to just hearing about actions.
