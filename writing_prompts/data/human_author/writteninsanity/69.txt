"I swear to god this had better be worth it," I hissed as I kept driving down the dirt road slicing down the middle of the desert. John had been insistent that we come here today. Originally I'd thought it had been for some sort of surprise, but at this point, he'd at least let me know it was for a picture. 

For anyone but John, I would have turned around the second he'd said that, but John was getting really into fitness and Instagram. It had helped him a lot with self-esteem issues and.

Maybe Mom was right when she said I was too nice to some people. 

"We almost there?"I asked as John stared at his phone. Just rows of pictures; it must have been some new version of Instagram that he got to see for having enough followers. Whatever. "John?" I pressed.

"Just like five more minutes," he said.

"It's been five minutes the past three times,"  I said. 

"It feels like it's close," he said. That was an odd way to talk about the GPS. 

"Fine," I sighed and turned up the music. At least John hadn't argued to have some of his workout music on. I was all for support, but the stuff he listened to was a little intense. 

I looked at John, staring at his phone. He was sweating, smiling at the phone like something big was coming. Like this was going to be a big deal. I frowned at him and rolled my eyes. 

Suddenly John flung the music off. "HERE!" He shouted before pushing me a little. I struggled to pull over as he shoved into me. I managed to get the car to a safe stop. 

"John, what the f-" I started, but he was already out of the car, running away from the road and off into the dusty nothingness.  "JOHN!" I yelled after him. Goddammit, he was an ass. That was it; I was talking to my Mom when I got home and telling her that she was right. A guy gets a six-pack and-  "DAMMIT JOHN!" I yelled again before taking off in a jog after him.   


The sun beat down on me as I chased after my friend. It didn't take long for it to start burning my lungs and eyes too. John stopped, and I barely reached him. "Here," he affirmed, "right here." He handed me the phone. 

"John we'-" I stopped for several breaths, "we're in the middle of nowhere."

"Here," he repeated, "please."

"Fuck dude," I swore before snatching the phone from him. I didn't recognize what model it was, but I'd been using iPhones my whole life, so it wasn't like I had the best frame of reference. 

"Please," John pleaded; I could swear there was desperation in his eyes. Whatever. The sooner I got this over with, the sooner I could get home and then ghost him for two weeks. 

"Cheese, I guess?" I said before taking the photo. It was fantastic. Maybe he didn't look 'Instagram hot,' but he looked so damn happy. Smiling from ear to ear with eyes that told me that was all he wanted to do. "I-" I started. I wanted to be angry, but looking at that face. "Come see it, John," I motioned towards where he'd been.

The hot desert wind answered me. 

"John," I repeated before looking up. I was alone out in the wastes, barely able to see my car. John wasn't there. How would- What the- How was- It was flat for miles? How the hell was he going to just disappear. I spun around to check for him, but there was nothing. Was I going crazy? Maybe it was heatstroke. Was John waiting in the car?

I brought up the photo album on the phone, and John was there, smiling and peaceful, along with a thousand other faces that all looked like they'd figured out exactly what they needed to do...

What I needed to do. I pulled the phone up, just high enough that I could take a good selfie, that I could join them and kno- 

No. I needed to find someone to take it after I was gone. John wasn't being a jerk; he was sharing this with me. Everyone else was lost. We'd been found, and I just needed to ensure that more people would be found. I had to keep the chain going, to be a good friend. 

I was going to go home, and I was going to talk to my Mom.
