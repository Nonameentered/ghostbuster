Vanessa finished her spiel, and Kimberly continued to sit stock still on the couch. That had been a lot of information in a medium amount of time, and honestly it was a lot to take in. Halfway through, Kimberly had dismissed the idea that Vanessa was making everything up; she wasn't great off the top of her head. Once she'd settled on the fact that Vanessa was telling the truth, she'd tried to keep up, but previous trains of thought had led to half-listening, and now she only had partial context and a wide-eyed roommate waiting for a response.

So Kimberly went for the first thing to cross her mind, "Which one?"

"What?"

"Demon royalty," Kimberly clarified, "there are a lot. Which one is your..." Kimberly trailed off. Had Vanessa mentioned which parent it was? Did she have more than one parent? She could have sworn she said it without an S. After a moment, she restarted instead of continuing, "Which one are they?" she asked in a perfectly gender-neutral way.

Vanessa stared at Kimberly. "I need your help right now?"

"Yes-" Kimberly scooched a little over on the couch to make room for Vanessa, who didn't move, "sorry."

"I know it's a lot to ask, I just need you to cover for me and-" Vanessa stopped and put her hands in the pocket of her hoodie, "look, I know it's weird and a lot and, I'll like-" she pulled her hands out of her pocket again and looked over to the kitchen, "I'll do the dishes for like a week."

"Shhhhure," Kimberly managed. 

"Shit, you're not into it," Vanessa pushed her hair behind her ears which she hated the look of but did when she was stressed, "I can figure something-"

"Nononono," Kimberly stood up and corrected Vanessa's hair, "I'm helping with this."

Vanessa pushed Kimberly's hand away from her ear, "You sure?"

"Yes."

"You did that thing you do when you don't want to go out, but it's Saturday, and you know I'm going to keep answering so you eventually agree but then take forever to choose an outfit," Vanessa's hands went back into her hoodie as she flopped down onto the couch in Kimberly's place. 

"I was processing the dishes thing," Kimberly explained, "and say less next time."

"Sorry, I'm just-" Vanessa freed one hand from the pocket to motion at her entire face instead of talking, "right now, ya know?"

"Yeahhhh," Kimberly answered, "I guess so. Mom keeps asking me when I'm going to start dating again."

"You should, Kim. He sucked. You've moved on."

"Not the topic," Kimberly pointed out, "but I love the energy." Kimberly took a second to survey her roommate, who was sulking in the sweater she'd bought in the first year of University that was now strictly relegated to living room lounging. "What are we wearing tonight?" She asked after taking stock of how well her roommate's clothes matched her mental state.

It took Vanessa a moment to process what Kimberly was asking,  which was unfair because Kimberly had gotten almost no time to process, 'I'm a part demon and pretend to marry me for my parent.'

Kimberly noted that she needed to ask again about the parent's identity so she could choose a pronoun and stick to it. 

"I have a dress," Vanessa eventually said, "but I need to change too, so I don't have time for a fashion show."

"Yeah, you should get out of the hoodie if I'm marrying you," Kimberly pointed out with a frown. That had been the second time in the past minute that Vanessa had mentioned how long it took her to get ready, and she was sure she didn't deserve those shots right now. Kimberly offered a hand to Vanessa, "Just a dress shouldn't take you too long, should it?"

Vanessa grabbed her hand and got half-pulled off the couch, "No, no, I need to-" Vanessa paused, "I'm going to clarify. I'm a demon," she really accentuated the last word as she stood up. 

"Figured that much out."

"Like a full-blood demon. Not half, no bloodline-" she took a deep breath, "I don't just have like- Cute horns and a little tail."

"Oh-" Kimberly answered; she'd been picturing almost precisely that. One of the kids in her High School had a pact somewhere way back in their bloodline and had red skin and small horns to show for it. He'd been a dick, but that wasn't from the pact, "That's cool, are li-"

"Two legs, two arms, one head," Vanessa clarified once she noticed Kimberly's mind going off the deep end, "but like, I'm not going to be wearing these-" Vanessa took off her glasses and waved them around. 

"You're blind without them," Kimberly pointed out, stepping away from the couch. 

"As a human."

Kimberly almost made it halfway to her room before stopping, "You chose to need glasses?"

"I didn't choose anything about this," Vanessa pointed out, "I can choose to be human, Kim, but-" she was halfway through that slight arm motion she made when she was going to explain something but stopped herself. "No time to get into all of that," then after a second, "thank you, thank you, thank you." 

"Don't mention it," Kimberly answered, and by the time she'd done so, Vanessa had already zooped through her bedroom door. Kimberly waited in the hall for a moment and pulled her phone out.

The first two things she typed into google felt discriminatory, even if she didn't know what she shouldn't say about Demons. After a moment, she figured out, 'My Roommate is a Demon. What do I do?'

All of the results were people talking about roommates or unhelpful articles written about dealing with bad roommates that would end with 'try talking to them.' Kimberly bit her lip as she stared at her phone. Had she ever said that someone was being a 'demon?' Had Vanessa been bothered by that but hadn't wanted to mention it? She'd need to scratch it off her vocabulary to be sure. 

*Vanessa: Hey! Black if you can.* 

*Vanessa: Thank you thank you thank you*

Kimberly tried to take mental stock of the dresses she owned and had worn less than three times in public. Was there anything with the tag still on it? That would be even better. 

*Kimberly: How fancy?*

*Vanessa: Pacifico, not Dome.* 

Kimberly nodded to her phone and then put it away, dipping into her own room. Pacifico had been the classier bar back in University. Had they had a clause against jeans? That-

That wasn't what Kimberly needed to focus on right now. 

The closet was already open from earlier this morning when she walked over to it, kicking a heel that had escaped the boundary back into the mass of shoes on the floor. In a practiced motion, Kimberly pushed aside all of the daily clothes and revealed the back left of the closet, along with most of her dresses, from maxi to bodycon.  

Based on what Vanessa had said, cocktail was the vibe she wanted, but Kimberly still had choices to make despite knowing that. She was supposed to be meeting the parents (parent?), not dressing up for going out, which eliminated a lot of options because she was reasonably sure that first meetings should only have a conservative amount of leg involved. 

Kimberley's pocket buzzed as she pulled a dress off of the rack and spun to lay it down on the bed. Was knee height too much or not enough leg to be a cute fiancee to a demon? It would be one of the many contenders.  

The phone buzzed again, and Kimberly's hand shot into her pocket before she'd processed it. 

*Vanessa: You good?* 

*Vanessa: Need help?*

*Kimberly: It's been like 30 seconds.*

*Vanessa: No.*

Kimberly looked up to the timestamps on the previous texts. Shit, she'd been considering the pile of dresses for a lot longer than she thought. Sure it was only 5 minutes, but she understood the text now. 

*Vanessa: I'll come over.* 

Kimberly returned to the closet with her phone in one hand. It buzzed again. She turned on the flashlight to look at the small selection of carefully folded dresses on the top shelf she could barely reach.

*Vanessa: Don't freak out, okay? Not feeling it atm.* 

Kimberly got onto her tip toes to try and reveal one of the darker options on the shelf above, eventually grabbing the smoke dress she'd thought of out in the hall and pulling on it to add it to the pile. The dress slid out, but the pile shifted. She couldn't pull that trick on tiptoes again. 

The door cracked open, and Kimberly was already facing it in the process of turning to put the dress on her bed. The person at the door wasn't her roommate. Or, more correctly, it wasn't the Vanessa that Kimberly was used to.
