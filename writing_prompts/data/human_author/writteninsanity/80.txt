I was gonna be honest. I hadn't been worried when Alicia had asked for a sword for her birthday. We'd raised her in a household of nerds, and if I was going to have Avacyn, Angel of Hope's Spear on display in our front hall, I had to assume that she was going to want a weapon herself one day. 

On top of that, I was ecstatic when she'd dived headfirst into fitness and started going to the gym every day on top of nightly runs. I'd tried to keep up with her initially, but I didn't have anything on teenage dedication, so I let her pursue the level of health she was striving for, and I was proud. 

Maybe I should have realized what was going on when she'd come home one day with raw tanned leather and asked to use Mom's sewing machine, but hey, a little bit of armour for cosplay hadn't hurt anyone before. 

After all of this, the thing that gave it away was the text messages that I saw on her phone when it was charging on the counter. Call me a bad parent if you want to, looking at my child's phone and all that, but my chest got a little tight when I saw my daughter talking to someone about saccing North Italy this summer. At first, I'd thought it was a euphemism, but then I'd learned that she was just getting really into the Goth phase of her life. Great. Teenagers. 

So that's what I'd been handling for the better part of the week. Both Sarah and I had been too busy with work to have a proper meeting, so this had been the first time we'd sat down to talk about our daughter's new interests and how to handle them, 

"Is it that big a deal?" I asked with Alicia's sword sitting on the table between Sarah and me. "I mean, she's a teenager. She's going to be into some weird stuff, and then we'll have great pictures to show at her wedding." 

"Do you think she's going to want a Catholic wedding after saccing the Church?" Sarah asked. 

"Our wedding was only Catholic to make my parents happy," I pointed out, "plus she's not actually going to Italy or any of that." Sarah made the eyes at me. "Alicia isn't in trouble or anything, honey," I reached across the table for her hands, "I've done way weirder roleplay."

"James," she flicked my hands off of hers, "this is serious." 

"Is it?" I asked. 

"James."

"Fine, I'll talk to-" 

Alicia pounded at the front door before swinging it wide open. She had gone out for a run in her leathers this time. She tossed her braided hair back over her shoulder before nodding to Sarah and myself. "Clan mother, Clan Father." 

Sarah gave me a look again and then went off downstairs. Alicia had always been more likely to listen to me, so I guess it was up to me. I grabbed her sword off the table and cut Alicia off on the way to her room. She looked up at me and then at her weapon. "Alicia," I greeted. 

"Father," she responded. 

"You know, we don't know much about what the Goths spoke firsthand," I held her blade out of her, "but we definitely know it wasn't formal English." 

Alicia's shoulders dropped a little bit at my point. "I don't know it feels right." 

"Yeah, pretty sure the Romans were more likely to call me 'father,'" I nudged the sword toward her again, and she grabbed it from me. "Can I grab you for a sec?" I asked. 

"Sure," she answered. 

I took Alicia back outside and made up some bullshit about needing to move a few things in the shed so we could have a reason to be alone and 'randomly end up talking.' It was way better than saying 'we need to talk' to a kid. The walls went right up if you did that. 

"So," I said, "looking at raiding any countrysides soon?" 

"Raiding is the wrong word," she pointed out, "we're finding a new home."

"We?" I asked. 

"The-"

"Goths, yeah, I got it," I counted one, two, three so we could move a bag of mulch up onto a shelf. Jesus, she'd gotten strong. "Got friends interested in it to then?" I asked. 

"Not as much as me-" she counted this time for the second bag, "but some friends are joining me at the gym and stuff."

"There an end goal to this?" I asked, leaning against the wall to represent that I wasn't willing to lif the next bag quite yet.

"I don't know," she said, "is there an end goal to-," she thought about it for a second, but she'd shot too high with the high concept response and fell short. "It's who I am."

"You're half Irish, half French Canadian," I pointed out, "your last name is O'Connor." 

"French Cana-"

"Grandpa Despard," I pointed out. 

"Right," Alicia frowned at the floor for a second like I'd just taken away her toys. "I like it okay?"'

"Yeah," I answered, and she lit up with that 'really Dad?' look. "Don't do anything stupid," I added.

"It's not-"

"It's very stupid to invade North Italy," I cut her off, knowing where she was going with it.

Alicia paused for a second before motioning to the third and last bag of mulch in the shed. "Fine." 

One-Two-Three. 

"What else is this about, though?" I asked. "If you're into it, I should at least be on the up and up."

Alicia took time to explain the details of her new lifestyle to me, and Sarah hadn't been happy when I arrived home with a new sword and war paint two hours later.
