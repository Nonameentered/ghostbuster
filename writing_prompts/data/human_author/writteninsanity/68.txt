I never thought that Dark Overlord was the kind of career you could fall into, but there I was. 

I'd taken four years of adventuring training. I'd delved the depths of the Storm Sanctum. I'd hardened in the Crucible of Steel. I had done everything to train for one fight with the Dark Lord. A Dark Lord that had immediately abdicated from the throne and offered me the spot. 

By offered, I mean he bound all his demons, skeletons and armies to my will before I'd even gotten to draw Hygilwil, the Binding Blade. It hadn't made any sense, but the Dark Lord was gone in a flash, and I could head home. 

When I'd headed home, the monsters in the countryside went feral. For the past twenty years, they'd been under the command of a single source; they were predictable and avoidable. Without a guiding hand, the horrors of the outer wilds pounded on the gates of small villages. People died. 

I had a chance to save them. 

I'd returned to the Elderfang Keep and taken my, now fated, spot on the Throne of Teeth. I'd dressed the part and done the best I could, directing the massive forces of the Dark Lord away from doing harm. 

The first hero that had come for me hadn't listened to reason. He'd told me that my explanation was lies and that I was a scoundrel. He hadn't been prepared for the Holy Magic I wielded behind Hygilwil. I'd sent him scampering back to Tidebreak. 

Then the heroes kept coming. Trying to explain myself to, and then fighting, every single one of them started taking too much time. I needed space away from them to direct the armies of darkness, so I reinstalled the traps I'd once slipped past on my way to fight Exetus. They killed some heroes, but they bought me valuable time. 

Today the door of my throne room creaked open in the middle of the night. I'd just finished managing a skeleton rebellion, which meant the last thing I needed was a spunky brat coming in to tell me how I was harming the kingdom. 

Before the hero was even in the room, I was waiting in the centre of it, with Hygilwil drawn. 

A younger girl with her hair tied back and eyes on fire burst into the room with an older mage tucked behind her. Her sword was already drawn, but I stared right past her to the mage that she guarded.

The Codex Afflitcia: the Scourgebook of the Dark Lord. 

"DARK LORD!" the girl and I both called out at once, levelling our blades. She pointed the tip of her holy sword at me, and I pointed the end of Hygilwil at her companion. The girl didn't react to the fact that we were saying the same thing, but the man behind her flinched. 

It was either a coward that had somehow found the Afflitcia, or it was the man who'd run away all of those years ago. There was one way to figure it out. 

I channelled my light into Hygilwil and suddenly flashed across the room, blade drawn and in the air ready to strike. In the half-second, before my blow landed, I saw his eyes, confident, black pools of darkness. That was him. That was Exetus. 

There was a brilliant flash of light, and the thin holy blade Kaldir cut in front of Hygilwil as the previous dark lord leapt to the side, clumsily dodging my strike. 

"Dark Lord," the girl and I both spat at once. 

"Your fight is with me, Dread King," the new hero hissed, "leave my father out of this."

"My fight," I started as I pushed the girl away and slashed the enchanted steel of Hygilwil through the air, "is with him!" 

I went to charge the Dark Lord, but the Hero slipped in front of me, fast as lighting and struck out at my Dread Armour. I batted her blade away instead of continuing my assault.  Sparks of holy light flashed around the room. I caught the Dark Lord's smirk flashing under his hood. 

"Girl," I yelled, "you don't know what you're-"

"Call me the hero," she bellowed before lashing out with Kaldir. The Blade of the Holy Storm shattered the air between us, filling it with booming thunder and the fury of the wind. The hurricane crashed against Hygilwil, the Blessed Earth. My cape billowed in the wind, and I met her eyes. 

"Stop protecting him."

"I'll never abandon my friends!" she snapped back before breaking, pulling Kaldir back and striking again. The whipping wind crashed uselessly against the stalwart mountain of Hygilwil in the hands of its true master. 

"He's not your friend," I corrected. He was the Dark Lord. Also, had I really sounded like that during our fight? Had I been that deaf?

"You're right," she sheathed Kaldir and took a deep breath. "He's my father. When nobody loved me, when I was in an orphanage, he gave me a chance. He told me that I was the chosen one and that-" she kept talking, and her blade began to glow. I knew this moment. She had to talk to let the divine light of the angels charge her sword. It had been my plan against Exetus. 

In a flash of Holy Light, I was on top of the Dark Lord and the Codex Afflitcia. He barely raised his arms in defence, taking the time to speak instead. 

"I couldn't fight fate," he said as Hygilwil crashed down on his elderly form, "but I could take you down with me."

The dark lord scattered across the floor, black blood splattering the tiles. He was right; he couldn't run from fate. I could feel his magic fading. The reign-

"YOUR REIGN OF EVIL IS OVER!" The girl cried. I spun to see her above meâ€”the storms and heart of the people behind her. 

I didn't raise Hygilwil to block, I'd been my kind of hero, and I deserved to rest.
