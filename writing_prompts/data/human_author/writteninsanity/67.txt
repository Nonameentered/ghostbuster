I cleaned the blood of the Demon Prince off of Ryathir, the Sword of Stars. The constellations on the blade gleamed, illuminating the darkness of the dream keep. The Demon Prince had been the slave of the Dark Lord, the last obstacle before I could finally face him. 

How many atrocities had he committed? I'd almost lost everything to get here, and for once, a member of the Holy Order was going to face down Exetus. The door to the throne room loomed over me, draped in shadow. 

I took a deep breath. I was going to tell him everything that I knew during the fight. How many of my friends he'd hurt. How many lives he'd ruined. I wanted him to die when he was thinking about his sins. 

Ryathir flashed its stars in approval. 

The massive door screeched as I shoved it out of the way, revealing the throne room of the Dark Lord. Ryathir's light pierced the shadows and sent them scurrying as I pushed my way in. 

I didn't bother trying to hide. If it had gone bump in the right, I'd killed it before Ryathir had accepted me as the true Shaper of Stars; now that the light accepted me, there was nothing in here that could stop me. 

Exetus was draped over his throne, blood-red cloak hanging over the armrest and a ruby goblet in his right hand. "My boy," he mused from his place across the room. "So nice of you to finally join me."

"You will pay for what you've done," I spat before levelling Ryathir at him, "I will make you feel the pain of those you-"

"I just want to talk," the Dark Lord corrected, his words were slick black poison, "we can just talk, can't we?"

"I think we're far past the time for words," I hissed before charging with Ryathir. The Dark Lord stared me down instead of moving. 

"The hero," he started, "striking down the man who just wanted to talk peace." He barely moved to put down his goblet. "How would that look written into the stars of Ryathir? What kind of-"

He stopped speaking as I slashed Ryathir down at him, but he was right. I was better than him. I- Dammit.

The dark lord started laughing. It wasn't a cackle or the deep gloating laugh I'd heard in the distance before, but a genuine laugh. "Oh, Dread Gods above," he chuckled, "being good must really suck." He reached up and poked the edge of Ryathir. It would have been so easy to just slam the sword down. I could have finished it right here and now.  "Shaper of the Stars now," he said, "right boy?"

"Shaper of your doom," I hissed. 

"I'll take that as a yes," he ran his finger along the edge of the blade, and it tried to rebel against me. Ryathir wanted to cleanse his darkness from this land. "Alright, I surrender. Take me to the King."

"I-" I pulled back Ryathir and scowled at the Dark Lord; he wasn't actually going to come with me. This was all a trick. A ploy of dark forces to try and conquer the infinite light of stars. It didn't matter what it was. He would try his gambit, and then I would finally get to strike him down for everything he did. 

"Well?" he asked, "take me away."

"The King said dead or alive," I spat.

"and I'm choosing alive," he pointed out, "so come one hero, bring me in front of your lord and claim your *prize*." He hung on the E for too long. He knew that the King's approval wasn't the prize. It had never been about the  Kingdom, or the gold, or the adoration. It had always been about. "I'll behave."

It had always been about killing him. 

Ryathir was suddenly heavy in my hands, the enchantment on the steel dripping off by each doubtful second. This had been about killing him. It had been about punishing him. It had been about winning. It had been about- Ryathir dropped from my hands, clattering down beside the Dark Lord, the starlight fading from its constellations. 

"No, no, no," Exetus tsked, "the good guys aren't powered by hate." He put a hand on my shoulder, "they want justice, to stand up for what's right." He nudged the holy blade with his foot. "Ryathir won't stand for anything less." 

"I-" 

"You hate me," Exetus mused as he tightened his grip on me, "I don't think hate is bad. I think hate is useful; it's the driving force that got you here." He leaned in close to me, and I could feel dark magic seeping into my skin. "But I don't make the rules, the Gods do, and Gods don't like hate."

The darkness didn't hurt; it just felt cold, like I'd been left on the street to die. 

"Being a good guy must really suck," Exetus repeated before ending it all.
