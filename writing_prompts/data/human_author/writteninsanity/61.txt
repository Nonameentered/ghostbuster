Dr. Adalay looked deep into my eyes. She'd realized what the data meant too. "We need more time," she whispered, more for herself than me. "We did it, but-"  Dr. Adalay trailed off but I could fit in the missing pieces. We'd created teleportation, motivated and funding by replacing all forms of travel to a carbon free alternative but- 

2 Degrees, that had been the reasonable range that we predicted for manageable climate change. A 2 degree change in Earth's average temperature would have been devastating but manageable. Instead we were already nearly at 2 degrees and four degrees was nearly unavoidable. 

We'd engineered a marvel, and it was too little too late.

Dr. Adalay, Maude, flopped down onto one of the many rolling stools around the lab and drifted off toward the corner. I leaned against the desk where the computer that ran the calculations was. We hadn't run the data of our teleporter becasue we always knew there was no point unless we could make it happen...

But now? Now we'd just made travel more convienent for the billions of peolpe staring doom in the face. Ignorant Governments that had let companies burn and burn until now it was that Eartht hat was burning. 

In the corner, Maude sobbed once, and then the tears just flowed without her really crying. 

We didn't deserve this. We'd tried so hard and it was their fucking fault. I'd missed birthdays, Maude had missed her Dad's funeral, we'd burned every bridge we'd ever built. We'd given up everything but each other and.... We'd get nothing for it. At least nothing that we'd tried for.

"This is so fucking stupid," she said.

"I know," I answerd.

"What can we do?" she asked, but we both knew there weren't more steps that she or I knew how to take. 

"Why does the teleporter only go short distances?" I asked.

"Because the closer you get to the speed of light and evenutally exceed it during instatannous transport the less instatatnious that transport becomes outside of the-" she trailed off. I didn't know if she had the same idea that I did, but it was a dark one. 

"Let's remove that limit," I suggested, "go as far as we can, and then come back. We can blink a thousand years away."

"You're crazy" she said.

"I know."

"What about-" she started but she didn't have someone to suggest to me. Burned bridges. "What's even the point?"

"It could be better, we could have figured it out a thousand years from now," I pointed out. "maybe somehow this thing," I pointed to the teleporter in the corner, "saves everyone."

"What if we come back and everything's dead?" she asked.

"Then we didn't have to watch it die." I took a step toward the teleporter, carefully laying the plans somewhere where someone would find them. "I don't need to stay now," I pointed out.

Maude pulled herself from the chair. She was dead behind the eyes, but you had to be, to make a choice like this. 

Dr. Adalay grabbed my hand, and together we left the present behind.
