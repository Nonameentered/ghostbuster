Short answer to the first part:

I was raised Roman catholic, the kinda family that went on Christmas but really couldn’t afford the time every Sunday. I went to Catholic school for both elementary and high school. Ended up hard Atheist.

Studied religious texts as part of philosophy for my journalism schooling (yes really) and ended up agnostic because imo, knowing either way is impossible unless something really speaks to you.

In short, educated, don’t really believe, but the messaging and iconography of religion are powerful tools of kindness in the right hands.
