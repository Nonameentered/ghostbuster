The woman previously known as Terror-volt lived in a quaint bungalow in a mostly investor vacant suburb on the West side of town. The only thing denoting it from the cookie cutter designs on either side was a small doormat that said 'buzz off' with several bees flying around, and a lawn sign letting passers-by know that the property was part of the now-defunct villain rehabilitation program.

Ryan had turns around twice during the walk from his car to the front door, and he'd spent the entire time muttering that this was a stupid idea, but a stupid idea was better than the other proven failures. He knocked three times and then hit the doorbell.

There was no 'ding dong' the doorbell didn't work. There was also no answer.

Ryan knocked five more times, with the fifth being more of a proper pound than a knock. The sound of fist on wood echoed over the empty street, and a fall breeze slipped between the porch rails.

"Most people know better than to knock twice," said the voice on the other side of the door as it opened to the unlit entryway beyond. Standing just out of arms reach of the door, was Terror-Volt.

Six foot two, sharp blonde hair with eyes that could freeze snow, Terror-Volt was an intimidating woman. Even four years out of the game she was still in Olympic shape, and her civilian wool sweater did a poor job of softening her. Her scowl creaked into a smile as she looked over Ryan at the door.

"It's been a while," she greeted with a spark of joy that seemed desperate to escape her dour exterior. "To what do I owe the pleasure?"

"Well," Ryan started before taking a deep breath. "Well, Terror-Volt."

"Ryan."

"Sorry," Ryan took another small breath, "Miss Terror-Volt."

"Theresa," Terror-Volt corrected before taking a step back to allow Ryan into the entryway.  "I think you're too old to call me Miss."

"Okay," Ryan said before following her inside. He took off his sneakers at the door, tucking them beside a pair of pink runners and black thigh-high boots that clearly hadn't been worn for months. "It has been a while."

"Four years," Theresa said as she reached over to turn on the light, the LED took have a second before igniting a soft blue. Mandated colour environments from the rehabilitation program.

"Three and a half," Ryan corrected while he half took off his jacket before realizing how cold Theresa kept her house. "I saw you at the um-" it was going to be an awkward sentence but he'd already started it at this point, "at the trial."

Theresa shrugged as she took a left into a lit room that Ryan couldn't see. "We didn't talk and you didn't testify so I don't think it really counts."

Ryan followed her into the room which turned out to be the kitchen and Theresa was already making her way over to the cupboards. "I guess so," Ryan said as he took a quick scan of her kitchen. The knives were tucked in a lockbox that needed a four digit code.

"Do you want tea?" Theresa asked, "are you staying long enough for that or are you just saying hi?"

"I don't know," Ryan admitted.

"Well ain't that mysterious," Theresa mused before pulling a small box out of the back of the cupboard, "you were a lemon tea with two sugars right?"

"No sugar thanks," Ryan corrected while smiling. He'd only had tea during his kidnappings when he was twelve. Every other year it'd been either juice or coke because Mom and Dad wouldn't let him have any.

"Black tea, what a grownup," Theresa took a pair of teabags out of the box and placed them on the counter while she grabbed a pair of mugs from the adjacent cupboard. "Are you allowed to be here?"

"Mom and Dad don't know."

"No shit," Theresa pointed out, "but within the program."

"Oh yeah, that only covers Mom and Dad," Ryan said like it was obvious, but he had checked the wording on the grudge clause this morning to make sure that he wasn't going to get Theresa in trouble by coming here.

"Great," Theresa turned the electric kettle on before double checking, realizing it didn't have water in it, and starting to fill the kettle. "How's university going."

"Uhhhh," Ryan paused long enough for it to be an answer.

"Hey if you're going to be a doctor you need to do well there." Theresa put the kettle down and turned it on properly. "It was-"

"Yeah I don't think I'm doing that anymore."

"That's fair, not many people stick with the thing they thought they were going to be as a kid. I thought I wanted to be marine biologist."

Ryan chuckled. Theresa smiled and scratched at one of the two glowing cufflinks she was wearing.
