"So, do you want to get coffee or something sometime?" I asked Tanihime as she sat across from me. She screamed something about not liking me at all and asked me what I was thinking. 
  

  
I dodged the slap, and she fled. 
  

  
That had been the plan; I needed some quiet instead of awkward pauses every thirty seconds. I had to keep Tanihime around because she was the princess, and I was supposed to keep track of her, but at the same time, good God, please just say what you mean. 
  

  
When I was fifteen, I'd asked God if I could die and go to an anime paradise, a place just like my favourite series, 'In Another World with Cheat Codes.' Turns out that my wish was granted eleven years too late. Now I was 'In Another World and Annoyed.' 
  

  
I poked at the dumplings I'd ordered from the in, shoving them from side to side in the soy sauce and trying to will myself to eat another serving of these. The chef here only knew three recipes, so I picked my poison each day. 
  

  
The lights dimmed, and I stuck my fork into the dumplings. The inn door cracked open, and a squeak somehow cut over every conversation. 
  

  
"Byr-" the evil man started in his low droning voice. 
  

  
"Royal Vizier," I greeted. He wasn't a bad guy yet, but-
  

  
"How are you doing?" he asked with a subtle evil chuckle at the end. Between the constant laughing and the fact that he dressed exclusively in black and red, we all knew where this was going. 
  

  
"Fine,"' I answered as I got up from my table and turned to face him. 
  

  
"Are you going to fight the Demon General today?" he asked. 
  

  
"Maybe," I answered, it was the only thing that made him stop pestering me. The conversation always kept going until I gave him some sort of positive. 
  

  
"Good to hear," he hissed with another evil chuckle, "you know I shall be right there to support you on the battlefield," he pushed up his glasses, and they somehow gleamed in the shadowed inn. Reality bending characterization there.
  

  
"Of course, I'd trust you with my life," I answered to get him to shut up. 
  

  
“Most excellent,” he responded with another chuckle before sweeping his cloak around himself and slithering out of the inn. Once he was gone, I sighed. There was no getting through to him, not even after a night of drinking, so I’d taken to just delaying him. 
  

  
Everyone here was skin deep, maybe one dark secret but the second you knew what that was, they were back to their archetypes. Evil vizier, tsundere, hot-but-not-the-person-I-canonically-sleep-with. It was shit like this that had made me stop watching anime eight years ago. 
  

  
“Kyyyyya!” Tanihime screeched from outside the inn. 
  

  
“Jesus Christ,” I swore before tossing a pair of gold onto the table and picking up the Holy Blade. 
  

  
“What?” the chesty innkeeper asked?
  

  
“Nothing, I meant to say ‘By the Goddess, ’” I corrected before heading outside.
  

  
I was going to run into one of three things out here, either I was going to see Tanihime dealing with Jotamo, the Royal Vizier, or one of the Demon General’s skeletons had come into town to try to restart the plot. Those were solved by ‘letting Tanihime take care of it,’ ‘telling him to go back to court,’ and ‘a single guided strike with God Mode on’ respectively. 
  

  
Tanihime was in the middle of the street pointing at a woman, surprisingly. The woman was wearing a cobalt blue dress top, which was way too bright a colour for a background character. “Oh my god, what are you wearing?” Tanihime screamed while pointing at her pants. 
  

  
Her jeans. 
  

  
JEANS?!
  

  
I rushed forward and shoved Tanihime out of the way. She comedically tumbled into a pile of melons, and I held the Holy Sword out towards the new addition to the cast. She took three steps back before adjusting her glasses on her mousey nose. 
  

  
“What the fuck is going on?” she asked.
  

  
“Oh my God,” I said, “you have no idea how nice that is to hear!” I dropped the sword and took another step toward her. I needed to hear another person just say a damn normal hello. “Hello!”
  

  
“Hello?” she asked, shaking as she tripped over her feet and ended up on the ground in front of me. Her hello was like music to my ears, no character quirks to be seen. 
  

  
“You, okay?” I asked. 
  

  
“NO,” she answered. Oh God it was a normal answer. I was in heaven… well, I notably wasn’t. That was the issue, but it’s a metaphor, dammit. “What’s going on?” she asked.
  

  
“Well,” I reached a hand out to her, “I have a lot of explaining to do, but we’re all so happy you’re here.”
  

  
“This looks like one of my little brother’s shows,” she said as she grabbed my hand.
  
“You learn to hate it,” I explained, “but I’m sure it’ll be easier with two of us.”
  

  
“What?”
  

  
“I’m from earth too,” I offered.
  

  
“Byrantin! What’s going on?” Tanihime screamed. 
  

  
“Bryan,” I corrected, “Toronto, Canada. Been there for three years.”
  

  
“Sa-“ the girl fainted instead of finishing that sentence. 
  

  
Huh, she did have a character quirk.
