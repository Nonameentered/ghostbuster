So I had the pleasure of reading this out loud at campfire, and it certainly reads well!   


I'm going to echo Kat's point with the scene, but I think it's more clashing against word count closer to the end. I also found that the:  


“The hell are you doing on my boat?” she shouted, shirt in hand. She balled it up like a boxing glove and struck the bulkhead door. The steel rang like a bell. “I asked you a question.”  


Read a little weird. I kinda wanted a 'I busily tried to look at anything but her' to give us time before 'I asked you a question.' Let the MC have time to have silence as their response. 

The second to last line is AAA Prime Steak.  Honestly, I'd suggest ending there. I like the current helpful note but the other line is just so darn strong.
