"Do you know why villains always lose?" Jade asked as she paced around the room in front of a small selection of the world's absolute worst people of power. She, a small marketing and logistics intern from Southern Ontario had somehow managed to convince everyone from Ashes to Wreckingball to show up to her little meeting. 

She was completely going to die for this. 

"Bec-" Ashes started but Jade held up a single finger. 

"Rhetorical question. None of you know why the bad guys always lose because if you did, then none of you would be here, because you'd be out there winning. It's like, if there were actually a pill that could make dick bigger, you wouldn't need to see ads for it, because the person who made it would be a gazillionaire." 

"That's a fake number," Mathtomaton answered. 

"Yep," Jade gave Mathomaton the point, "it is. But the point stands, all of you wouldn't be here unless you didn't know the answer, because I'm nobody." Jade waited a moment and adjusted her blazer. She needed every one of them to be in on this initial premise, that she might have the answer, for this to work. After a palpable moment of pause, she jumped over to the next slide. 

"This is the anatomy of a usual story-arc within any of the heists, schemes, plans and slash or capers that all of you, and every other villain perform."  she pulled out her clicker which she'd use step by step to establish the infographic. "First we have the plotting phase, mostly offscreen, but it's the place where you make an airtight plan that the heroes have no chance of stopping."

"Yes, we all already plot out the demise of the Dream Team and other heroes." Dr. Devilish tried to explain. 

"Of course and the plans are great, no questions there," Jade took a deep breath, "but then we go to execution which, also goes flawlessly. The heroes show up just when you intend them to because they're predictable. Everything is going so well and the fight begins." 

Jade went to the next slide, where the infographic split off into two options. "Some capers end here, with the Heroes overpowering the villain and throwing them away, but many more of them, or at least the large and dramatic ones, go to the next phase, the Darkest hours." 

"I love the darkest hours," Ashes pointed out. The rest of the villains nodded in agreement. 

"So do I," Jade said, " but it's always followed by the 'Dawn' when the heroes come out on top because they find a strength that you could have never planned for, or another ally arrives in the nick of time even though they'd fought with that hero earlier. Heck, sometimes both. This is where I think I found the key to everyone her losing over and over again." 

She had the group now, she just needed to stick the landing. "Which is, that the heroes work as a team because they like each other."

There was a groan from the assembled villains. 

"We've done teamups before," Mathomaton pointed out.

"I'm gonna shoot her," Ashes cut in.

"We made the Fightful Four back in 2019 and we didn't win," Dr. Devilish snapped, "you don't know what you'r-"

"Yeah, but you're all dicks!" Jade yelled at the room. For a brief moment, she knew she was going to get splattered across the back wall of the room, but after a second, she might have actually been in the clear.  "You were all going to stab each other in the back and take the diamonds as soon as there was an opportunity to," Jade pointed out, "the Fearful Four wasn't a team, it was group of assholes using each other to be stronger than they were alone."

"That is the definition of a team," Mathomaton pointed out. 

"No, it's not," Jade pointed out, "that's a company. A team is supportive, and constructive and works on helping one another be better than they would be emotionally alone. It's a group that cares as much about each of the other parts, as the sum."

The room was silent. 

"Which is so stupid," Jade pointed out, "because we don't like each other. Why would we? Half of us have tried to kill each other at some point in the past year." 

"Ashes did kill me, but I got better," Wreckingball answered. 

"Yeah, exactly, but liking each other and wanting to be... friends is the only thing that's keeping all of you, and me, from crushing the heroes into the dirt. We're better at this! It's why we come so close to winning. But they fucking cheat by being friends."

"So what do you want for all of us to just be friends?" Ashes asked.

"No," Jade answered, "but I do I want to try. So I have a proposal for all of you," Jade went to the next slide which was an exotic beach. "We're going on a tropical vacation to try to see if we can like each other in the easiest place to like another human being, drunk and warm. Then we take our little vacation crew and see if we can take down a mid-size villain as a team."

"You keep saying 'we', but you don't have powers that we know about," Dr. Devilish pointed out. 

"No, I don't," Jade admitted, "but it's my idea so all I'd ask for payment is that I could be the team's marketing manager.  I really need this job." 

There was a moment of silence. 

"I mean fuck it, worst comes to worst I get drunk and still hate all of you," Ashes pointed out, "who's ridiculous mode of transport are we taking to the island?"
