The Princess pull the goblet to her lips in a long languid movement, letting the freezing metal press against her nearly white lips. To anyone else, it would have been foolish to tempt getting stuck, but the princess wasn't most people. She took a paced sip of the white wine inside and raised her eyes to the door as the frozen lock shattered and skittered across the glassy floor. 

The first breath of warmth swept into the room as the door cracked open,  like a new fire in an abandoned hearth. The wave of heat stopped short of the princess as she placed her goblet on the arm of her makeshift glacier of a throne. 

After a moment the door swung wide and the first person across from the Princess was the last person to close the door, "Astrid," he gasped, frost building on the visor of his King's Guard Armor. Behind him, spring retreated back down the hallway of the empty keep. "You're-"

"Here yes," Astrid responded with all the enthusiasm of a desolate lighthouse, "waiting?" she posited the question and then grabbed her glass, touching it to her lips before finally admitting, "Maybe."

The knight took a step forward and felt the temperature around him drop by several degrees. For the first time he surveyed anything other than Astrid in the room. 

"Welcome back," Astrid said finishing her sip and putting the glass back down. "Don't get too excited."

"What happened here?"

"Nothing of interest Kal," Astrid responded with feigned ignorance. 

"I-"

"Nothing of interest to you," Astrid corrected. 

In retort Kal took another several steps forward, but the chill started to strangle his bones, he stopped out of self preservation. "Clearly there is magic here."

"Naturally," Astrid said before quickly downing the rest of her glass and tossing it across the room so it clattered and then slid to the feet of the knight. The Princess' fingers were skill sketched on the gold surface in ice.  "but this Kingdom is of no interest to you anymore."

"Verdenaunt is my home," Kal argued. 

"And yet," Astrid leaned back in her chair and then waved her hand toward the door, "you may go see your home for yourself if you're so serious about it."

Kal looked back at the door and then to Astrid, looking down on him from her throne. After a moment of hesitation he steeled himself and wrapped his gauntlet around his sheathed blade. "You're not Astrid."

Astrid on the throne smirked. 

"Witch," Kal spat before readying his blade at the woman on the throne. 

"So quick to dismiss me love," Astrid responded, "I might not be the Astrid you knew, but I am no Witch."

Kal pulled a foot back to spread his weight out and get into a fighting stance. He eyes determined and hands steady, he would vanquish the monster holding his love's form. 

Astrid stood up, revealing the river of slow-dripping coagulated blood flowing from a wound above her hip. It ran down her dress for a moment before fading back into the white of her clothes. Astrid took a step forward and Kal noticed that her feet never quite touched the ground. 

"Astrid?" he asked. 

"Not as you knew," Astrid pointed out, stepping down from the glacier covering her throne and sliding toward Kal, bringing a wave of frost with her, "things change when you leave something unprotect-"

"No," Kal said.

Astrid laughed.

"NO-' Kal repeated and readied his blade.

"Please, I've been run through once by a King's Guard's coldsteel blade," Astrid scoffed as she placed a finger on the end of Kal's sword and walked her fingers up the broad side of it.

Kal dropped the weapon, a dozen memories weighing down the blade.

"You weren't here," Astrid repeating, "but you did come back, so-" she took her first steps past Kal toward the door, "you can choose how our story ends."

"Astri-"

"I can't leave my haunt unless someone else let's me out," she pointed out, "thank you for coming back as my loyal aide one last time-"

"Are you leaving?" he asked. 

"Yes."

"Can you-" Kal wasn't sure what was going on in the grand game, it had always been above his head, but he knew what he wanted them to be. "Can you forgive me?"

"I don't know," Astrid said, "I don't even know if you need forgiving-" The specter considered for a moment, "I suppose I'll leave that part up to you as well."

"As-"

Day broke in the hallway beyond, and the sun poured into the grand hall of for the first time since the betrayal. With the rising sun, Astrid was gone, and it was Kal's turn to be alone and scared in that room.
