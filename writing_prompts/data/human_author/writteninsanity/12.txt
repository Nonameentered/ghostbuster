I have attempted to read Worm multiple times, all of my friends are very into it, I cannot get past part one. Writing doesn't jive for me, it happens. I have played in several games in the Weaver Dice TTRPG system in the end though. 

In this case Ashes is a Tinker and Victorya is a Mover/Brute if we're talking those rules.
