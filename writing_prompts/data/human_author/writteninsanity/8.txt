The harbor was supposed to be evacuated. Sure, it was futile, but there had been a massive collaborative effort to get people to as much shelter as they could. Nobody in the city had a chance of surviving the impact, but broadcasting that on the airwaves wasn't going to help anyone. 

No, the closest thing humanity had to a chance was someone, anyone, on the other side of the world getting remarkably lucky and living until tomorrow. By all accounts it was hopeless, but that hadn't stopped Liberator from coming down to the blast zone. There wasn't anything that he could personally do about the meteor, but he'd been defending this city for almost two decades at this point, and he wasn't about to hang up his cape on it's last day. 

The soft waves of low tide washed over the barnacle covered rocks, and for the first time Liberator could hear them as he stood on the dock. It really had been a beautiful city hadn't it? He'd said that he felt lucky to be the city's defender over and over again in speeches as a young man, but...

Well now he felt it. He'd been born into a beautiful place. It had it's problems, but what city didn't? The joy was cut by knowing it was the city's last place on the map, but he could at least appreciate it for the time he had left. 

Then there was footsteps behind him, mixing into the sound of the tide. 

"Citizen, this space is supposed to be clear. Make sure you get to sa-" Liberator began his practiced speech as he turned. He stopped himself when he saw who it was. It wasn't a random citizen, it was Gravity Girl, 27, way too old for her name at this point, and here from half a province away. "Gravity Girl, what ar-"

"I'm here to help," the other hero cut him off. "It's Carrie by the way."

"Pardon?"

"My name," Gravity Girl clarified, and Liberator keyed into the fact that she wasn't wearing her usual mask, "I don't think it matters at this point but," the hero shrugged, "yeah."

"Nice to finally meet you Carrie," Liberator greeted with a nod, but didn't offer their own name. "Any bright ideas?"

"Don't think I have the firepower for something like that," the unmasked hero answered as she took several steps forward to look over the edge of the dark down to the low tide. The meteor wasn't close enough to seriously effect the tide yet, but it was moving so fast that it didn't matter. "Don't suppose you can do anything about it?" 

Liberator shook his head. He could fly, he was ultra durable, he had super strength, but it wasn't anything close to a continental scale. 

"Why are you here then?" 

Liberator shrugged. 

"Get lucky it is then."

The sea wind took over for a second. A siren from somewhere towards the downtown core echoed off the empty alleyways between the skyline and the water.  Then the pause continued to the point where it was almost dramatic. 

"Did someone ask for some luck?" asked a voice on the wind, sickeningly sweet like a poisoned apple. 

Gravity Girl swore. 

"What?" Liberator asked. 

"It's-"

"MISSUSFORTUNE!" the door to a shuttered ice cream stand fell off its hinges to reveal the woman as she announced her arrival, dressed head to toe in black and a devious shade of purple in a mockery of Gravity Girl's costume. "Lady Luck's-"

"Bad sister," Gravity Girl finished for her before turning around. 

"Let me finish my introductions," Missusfortune scowled, "and put on your mask, your face is indecent."

Gravity Girl narrowed her eyes. What did that even mean?

"Wasn't it Missfotune?"

"I got married," the villainess explained, "he suddenly got unlucky with an allergic reaction to his medicine and left me everything in the will, best heist I ever pulled. I'm a high-stakes shareholder of Comcast now."

"Did you come all the way here to ruin this?" Gravity Girl asked. 

"Ruin what?"

"Try and stop us from fixing that," Liberator pointed toward the sky. The meteor wasn't in view, but everyone knew what he meant. 

There was a pause as Missusfortune stepped out of the doorway and into the daylight to state at the sky. "Stop you?" she asked. "Why would I go doing that?" she clicked her heels against the dock and walked to the heroes. "I might hate everything about you boy and girl scouts, but," she shrugged, "how will I spend all of Howard's money if we're all dead?"

Gravity Girl stood in shocked silence. It wasn't technically a contribution to the conversation, but it was more constructive than the confused screaming that would have replaced it.

"So unless you're going to stop me," Missusfortune pointed out, "I'm probably our best chance of getting lucky today." she winked at Gravity Girl, which didn't help the confusion. 

Just then, there were more sirens in the distance. The two heroes looked at the sky, but the meteor wasn't in view yet. 

"Oh," Missusfortune continued, "and I brought some friends," she took a step back from the heroes. "Presenting, WRECKING BALL, PULLTERGHEIST, GHALAHAD-" Missusfortune continued the list for over a full minute, with villains arriving from the chaos they'd been making downtown to assemble at the blast zone. 

"What the fu-" Gravity Girl started. 

"We all hate each other love," Missusfortune explained, "but we live on this damned place too. All of the heroes are busy helping their own cities so-" she opened her arms to motion to the entire crowd that had formed. "Join the teamup and lets suicide squad this shit!" 

"What?" Ulbermach asked from the back in his heavy accent. 

"It is a turn of phrase, villains saving the world," Vintrolicity explained from the other side of the crowed. 

Gravity Girl and Liberator took a look at one another, and then Carrie dipped her hand into her pocket and took out her mask to put it back on. "Fuck it," Liberator finally said. 

"Beautiful," Missusfortune clapped her hands, "we can go back to fighting later but for now-" she took off her gloves one at a time, "it's time for humanity to get lucky."
