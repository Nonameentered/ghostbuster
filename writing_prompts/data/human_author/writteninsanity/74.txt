I shouldn’t have been smoking, but I needed a cigarette. It wasn’t that I had a craving, it was an excuse to get away from the music, to spend time out on the balcony listening to the vague bass through the doors instead of being at a party.

Tonight was about to get a lot harder too.

Justin slipped out onto the balcony about ten minutes after me. I could tell it was him because nobody else was going to join me out here.

“That spot taken?” he asked. His voice was filled with beautiful false confidence.

“Can’t you see I’m being dramatic?” I mused back.

“Then I’ll be dramatic with you,” Justin answered before sliding up beside me and looking down at the street. There was a moment of silence where I struggled to avoid staring at him.

“How’d that go?”

“Well,” he answered, “well… as well as it could have gone. Ya know?”

“Not really,” I admitted. Justin had a habit of bouncing between girls, but I was busy waiting for one guy.

“Uhhhhhh,” he started before I offered him my half-finished cigarette and he took it instead of finishing his sentence. Justin smoked, which was why I carried cigarettes. “it went well. Totally fine. Right thing to do and all.”

I gave Justin a once-over as he took a second drag from the cigarette, his ocean blue eyes were red, and his cheeks were coated in small crystals of salt. “Really?”

“Yeah.”

“You look like shit though,” I pointed out and held out my hand for the cigarette so he’d pass it back. Once he did, I didn’t bother taking a drag, I just held it between my fingers and tried to match the way he did things.

“Yeah, well,” he shrugged. He would keep shrugging at everything else I said tonight. That was the way the moods went. He needed someone to be there so I was there but- Someday he was going to see that I was the person who was always there right? He was going to suddenly realize that all of these girls were mistakes and that-

They were mistakes that he’d stop making one day.

It was cold outside, just cold enough that you could make smoke without needing a lighter. I passed Justin the cigarette and blew vapor instead for a while. Eventually he snuffed the cigarette on the railing and pushed away from the edge of the balcony. “I’m going to go grab another drink,” he announced, “want anything?”

“I’m good,” I lied.

“Okay. Be right back.”

“I’ll be here,” I called back, and that was the truth, because no matter how long it was or how stupid it made me, I’d be there. I’d be waiting for him.
