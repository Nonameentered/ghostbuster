1. I'm a huge fan of Sci-Fi and Urban Fantasy, but when it comes to shorter stories like the ones on WP I'm kinda willing to take a swing at anything. I do end up doing a good amount of comedy on the subreddit, but I also feel like the environment of writing prompts (Aiming for high emotions in a quick draft which keeps eyes) tends to lean towards extreme comedy or tragedy pretty hard.
2. My favorite FULL novel length thing I've done is Leviathan Wastes and it's BY FAR my least talked about of the main roster (Being TikTok, 42 Witches, Straylight, Evergreen and Leviathan Wastes) but also all of those are fairly old at this point. My recent favorite piece is a WAY too long sci-fi story written for a game I'm playing with friends. It might end up getting posted but it needs so much context... Anyway, all that to say my favorite changes week to week. I start to hate a lot of my old stuff once I build distance because I see things I could improve. 
3. 42 Witches because I am unlikely to be involved in the story itself. Not that cool but I don't tend to write about safe places...
