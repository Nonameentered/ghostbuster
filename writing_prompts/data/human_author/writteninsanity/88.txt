"What're we looking at?" Operator Callan asked.

"Image capture from my optics during the museum tour."

Callum frowned and then typed something into the haptic interface of our analysis AI, "and it's not auto-translated."

"No," I shook my head, "I scanned in on-site to make sure that's the real, honest to God English on there."

"'Well fuck me," Callum whispered to himself as he ran a hand through his neatly trimmed, dense, black beard, "that's a curiosity."

"More than a curiosity," I pointed out, "it's a big problem."

"Well yeah, no shit but-" Operator Callan was cut off by the doors to our analysis room hissing open and the slightly blue-tinted holoform of Administrator Hath stalking into the room with her hands clasped behind her back.

Callan shot me a glance that said, 'You called her?'

I shrugged as an answer before greets, "Administrator Hath, I believe the files we're looking at in here have already been sent to you."

"They were sent in real-time as the incident occurred, Frontierman," she said. I glared at her for a moment before correcting myself. The administration had promised me that they weren't going to be watching every part of the interaction between us and the Fotuans so that we could have a proper friendly meeting. "Yes," she cut off my train of thought, "we lied about watching you, but considering the incident that occurred, it seems that was in our best judgement."

I took a step away from the screen to let the holoform of Hath hover over it. I'd come halfway across the galaxy as a frontierman to avoid a proper job in the corps, but it turned out being good enough at anything made you a government contractor. "Seems so," was the only answer I gave her.

"You performed admirably with initial asset management," she added. "The trust that you extended to the Fotuan,"

"Inessa," I finished for her.

"The Fotuan Diplomat," she continued, "will be critical in the coming hours and days. We need to buy ourselves some time to handle this. Situation."

"How do we even handle this?" Operator Callan asked both of us. That was up to Administrator Hath to answer, but if she said anything else other than finding out the person who stole this artifact, she was reaching way too deep into the Sci-Fi on this one."

"This version of the artifact is likely human in origin, or at least a council species attempting to frame a human," Hath finally answered, "maybe looking to break down negotiations or make the first contact rocky enough that they have time to escape with the artifact. What's the timeline, Operator Callan?"

Callan took a deep breath, probably glad to not be so obvious at the bottom of the rank system in this room for a moment. "First contact probes arrived at Fotul Prime three days after the opening of the Sector to the council, so 18 solar days ago. The ongoing war between the Fotuan Grand Assembly and the Primarchs reached a ceasefire agreement 71 sol hours later to prepare for the first contact. This was the second diplomatic contact between our species at a cultural level. The rest has entirely been negotiation."

"That leaves over 360 hours when there have been boots on the ground from the Human Fed and some other council species. Just over 200 where there has been free travel to the above-ground federation base. In and out."

"That's a lot of time to lose a rock gentleman," Hath pointed out.

"We do have logs of every ship that was registered as leaving the system," Callan pointed out as a good thing, "you should already have it-"

"We've already started scrambling Frontiermen and Contractors in the area to stop and search those ships," Hath cut in, "but official craft are still banned from the three adjacent systems around it until first contact protocol is complete."

"So, what's the actual next step?" I asked. We had to do something. Assuming it was stolen wasn't a solution. Inessa was going to break at some point and want to tell everyone she knew, and even if we caught the person who stole it, returning the most precious relic a nation has isn't a great way to tell them that you aren't planning to strip-mine them for everything they're worth.

"I'd suggest you speak to the Fotuan Diplomat to buy us some time, Frontierman Hath; this is your first contact; we trust your judgement," Administrator Hath said to me before giving a quick nod and flickering out of the room.

"She's serious if she's using your last name," Callan pointed out.

"Yeah," I sighed, "and for what it matters, they don't."

"Don't what?"

"Trust my judgement," I elaborated, "if they did, they wouldn't have been recording my HUD during the contact in the Museum."

"Well, of course, they were," Callan said with half a snort, "if the Fed could choose, they just would have had armada cruisers in orbit, but the Council insists on Frontiermen."

I frowned at Callan's point. Handling unexpected Aliens was my job, but most of the time for me, that involved coming to planets where the first contact had been made and ensuring that humans wouldn't die trying to interact with the local species. Instead, I'd been consistent enough that I was the first human most of these Fotuans had ever seen. Inessa had at least seen documentation of what to expect from humans before she'd arrived.

After a moment, I took a deep breath, "Operator Callan, review my footage from the archive visit and see if you can date the artifact or find any signs of human interaction before my entry.  I'm going to go speak to the diplomat."

"What?" Callan asked. He understood the order. He just didn't expect the language coming from me. That was Mom's presence, all right.

"Callan, check out my optic feed and tell me if anything's weird on it. I'm going to go convince Inessa to give us more time to figure out what's going on before blowing up her planet's history-" I paused to think for half a second, "or convince them to let Fotuan law enforcement work with us on this."

Callan typed something new into the haptic controls to bring up new aspects of the images we'd recorded. "Do you know which one?"' he asked.

"We don't even know if they have a word for Police yet," I pointed out, "it's gonna be a long night."
