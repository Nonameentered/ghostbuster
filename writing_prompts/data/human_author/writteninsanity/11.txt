I love a lot of the stuff behind it, but like a lot of popular we serials (Practical Guide, Pale, Wandering Inn) at a certain point the story is so LONG it's impossible for everything to be A+, and a lot of them have bumpy starts.

That said, the amount of content those guys put out is simply staggering.
