The past year had been strange. I'd been following the traditional magic education path but all of my friends were on a different track from me. Mom's job meant I'd mostly grown up in the human realm, so my friends were applying to universities. Of course, that wasn't how it works for all of the schools I wanted to get into. They were going to scry a future in which I attended the school to see if they wanted to accept me. 

If this had been going well, I wouldn't have been on the internet trying to figure out how to apply to human universities, but sometimes you need to have something to tell dad when he comes to visit for the first time in three Earth years. I didn't want to be empty-handed when it came to options.

"Mithiel!" Mother called as she opened the front door. She was the only person who called me that. It would have been an insult to the bloodline to let her know that I was more comfortable with Mike at this point. Human names just didn't have the same meaning in the old tongue. 

"Hey Mom," I called back, "just a second I'm wrapping something up."

"Come down and help me-"

"Just a second I don't wanna lo-"

"Mithiel."

"Coming," I copied the longest part of the essay that I was filling out and left the rest of it, praying that this school didn't have some stupid activity timer like the rest of them. 

I hadn't heard the door close behind Mom yet, so I took the stairs instead of blinking across the house. Sure it was longer but I knew better than to do any magic when everyone on the street might be able to see us. If we were seen there was going to be hell to pay from both Mom's boss, and Dad. 

"There you are," Mom said as I reached the bottom of the stairs. She'd left a small pile of grocery bags at the door and had an array of envelopes under her left arm. She held out one to me. "It's from a school," she said. 

"Really?!" 

"Of course I told you it was just going to take some time to get to the hu-" Mom was cut off by me snatching the letter away from her hand. This was going to be so good. Even if it was a medium school I could tell Dad that I had options and that I wasn't going to be some mortal dropout. 

"Can you help me put these away first?" Mom asked. I hadn't taken my eyes off the back of the envelope but I assumed she was talking about the groceries. I reached behind my Mom to close the door and then channel sparks of life into my fingers, blinking the grocery bags to the kitchen. "Proper-"

"I'll put them away properly as soon as I'm done," I protested. When I looked up to my Mom I caught her with that 'You're being a brat but I'm in a good mood right now,' face. Eventually she relented and shrugged. 

"Fine," she said doing her best to contain excitement before she was suddenly leaning over my shoulder and whispering for me to open it open it open it. 

I broke the seal on the letter, which was just classic licked glue as opposed to a signet ring. Pulling out the contents I expected to read an entire admission paper but instead, I stopped at the first line.

"MIT?" I asked. That was a name I knew from a couple of movies and a bunch of Facebook posts talking about the benefits of drinking wine. It was a well known.... human.... university. 

Mom made a sound similar to the one she me when she saw a puppy. 

"I-" I swallowed, "um I meant to tell you but I was getting nervous about all fo the magic schools not reaching out so I started applying to some human uni-" Mom cut my off with a huge hug and giddy little jumps. "versities...."

"BY THE GODDESS!" She screamed way too loud into my ear, "My baby is going to MIT!"

"I'm sorry?" I suggested. 

My mom stopped bouncing and grabbed either side of her face. There weren't tears yet but the dam needed repairs. "Sweetie why would you be sorry-"

"I didn't tell you I was applying to human schools."

"I don't care you got into MIT," she said. 

"Jame's brother goes there."

My Mom took a second to compose herself before taking the letter from my hand and scanning it quickly. After a moment she handed it back. "So I know we didn't discuss a lot about magic universities," she said, "but MIT is a mixed school, they had a department of magical regulation."

"Oh," I started, "by the Goddess I-" it took a second to process. This had been a dirty secret but now it was suddenly great news. "Oh my Goddess I got in!" I jumped once. "Wait is it a good school?"

"The best!" 

"Yes!" I did a big fist pump and then tried to respect the Elven traditions a little by not jumping around too much. This was such a big deal. If I was in the best school then I was way better at magic than I thought. All the years of struggle and not being able to compare to my peers were behind me and-

"I wonder if you'll have Mr. Dobson?" My mom mused.

"Who?"

"My old Divinity professor," she said, "he was the best. He was such a cutie back in the day."'

"You-"

"There is a bench named after me sweetie."

I looked down at the letter, and then back to my Mom, giddy in her pressed pencil skirt. Ugh, I'd only gotten into my Mom's school so far?
