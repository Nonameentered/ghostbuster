Knight Longshot had a rough morning; unnamed scouts to the south had been pestering the border walls since dawn, and chasing them off had been exhausting.  Running on fumes in the early afternoon was dangerous. The last thing he needed was a squire stepping up and deciding that today was the day for a premotion. 

Then there had been a summons from Steward Overseer, something that apparently demanded immediate attention.

Longshot climbed his way to the third floor of the natural history museum, the closest thing Ottawa had to a castle and nodded to the two knights, Bombard and Defender, who were on Guard duty this afternoon.

"Any idea what the kid is talking about?" Longshot asked. Defender and Bombard were two of the older citizens with powers strong enough to be considered 'Knights'; luckily, that meant they were almost as over the cosplay as Longshot was. 

"No," Defender said, "Ranger Smoke went in there an hour ago, and we haven't seen anyone in or out since."

"If it's about the river, I at least get to tell him the bridge is under control," Longshot sighed and pushed open the double doors, striding into the room.

Steward Overseer might have been a 'kid,'  but he was a mammoth of a 16-year-old, six inches and a hundred pounds larger than Longshot, with a solidly college-level beard. "Longshot," he greeted, his voice a little too high for his political position. 

"My Lord," Longshot greeted and laid the five tungsten rods he carried as weapons on the ground as a sign of surrender. Not that they would have done any good against Overseer anyways, he had been lucky enough to be 13 when he was injected with the compound and even more fortunate in that he'd survived it.

"News from the Border," Overseer started.

"Well-"

"That wasn't a question, Knight," Overseer corrected before turning to face Longshot, "The rangers have spotted several large flying vessels in the air-" Overseer took a deep breath. "Look, we spotted something flying, and we don't know what it is."

"Do you think I'd know, sir?" 

"Your range augmented 'Dash' power is the closest thing we have to flight in our Kingdom," Overseer said, snapping back into proper form. 

"Permission to rise?" Longshot asked. None of the 23 known powers that someone could get from the compound allowed for flight, thank god,  but that meant that there were questions about what Ranger Smoke had seen on the border.

As if on queue, smoke billowed into the room as the Ranger returned and reformed. "They're over the border and approaching fast!" he yelled, still half incorporeal. 

"Knight! Knock it out of the sky!" Steward Overseer ordered, and Longshot snatched up his rods. It had to be today? It had to be when he was already prepared for a long nap. Longshot burst out of the throne room and called for the other two Knights to join him on the terrace. 

Once they were on the terrace, the three knights stared up at the silver mass above them,  slowly rotating and hovering in one place. There was a crackle, and then something like a loudspeaker called out. 

"Earthlings, your lead bullets are no match for our-" 

"Did he just say, Earthlings?" Knight Bombard asked, "Now I like the kingdom aesthetic we have going." 

"We repeat, your lead bullets are no match for our-"

Longshot nodded, only one thing to do then. The wars had gotten weird once kids were in charge. "HAVE AT THEE!" Longshot yelled, tossing one of his rods into the air. It hung for a second, and then Longshot's essence twisted around the rod and supercharged it. 

"Your puny weapons-"

CRACK

The tungsten rod shattered the sound barrier as Longshot fired it. He could focus the dash power outside of himself and launch objects at terrible speeds, and tungsten was used in railguns for a reason. 

A glowing red hole was in the middle of the craft by the time Knight Longshot had pulled out the other rods. 

In the craft, they left the loudspeaker on, and as the green essence wrapped around the projectiles, all the Knights heard was, "ABORT, ABORT!"
