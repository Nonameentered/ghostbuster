Alan’s phone rang six minutes into family dinner. He wasn’t going to answer but when he saw Kyle’s name he excused himself for a minute. 

“Alan,” Kyle said after hellos, “you’re the last guy I want to ask about this but- I need some cash man.”

The family man held the phone away from his mouth so his oldest friend wouldn’t hear him sigh.

Later that night Kyle pulled up to the white-picket fence in a Corolla 4 years past its death date. Alan was waiting on the sidewalk, and Kyle rolled down the window for him. 

“Two thousand dollars,” Alan offered. It was way more than Kyle had asked for. “It’s not for pills or bullshit. It’s for help.” Alan held up the pile of crisp hundreds. 

“Man, I’m fine I just, ya know-“

“Fuck off,” Alan demanded, “Veronica doesn’t want this sorta stuff around the kids, but you’re uncle Kyle to them.”

“I-“ Kyle drummed the steering wheel, his high was going to wear off soon. “Okay.”

“Okay,” Alan repeated.

“You can sleep down here,” Alan announced as he flicked on the basement lights. There was a neat ‘guest room’ on the far side, and a couch of memories for the kids to play on closer to the stairs.

“You kept this dumb couch?” Kyle asked.

“It’s a magic couch,” Alan pointed out. An in-joke from high-school. 

“Smells terrible,” Kyle added, sniffing at the thing.

“Smells like you then,” Alan caught himself halfway through a chuckle. “We have an early morning.” 

“You don’t wanna chill a-“ Kyle started, but cut himself off when Alan laid the two-thousand dollars on the worn coffee table. “little..”

“We’ll have lots of time after detox,” Alan reminded.

The blanket was heavy. Family photos were judging Kyle.  Two thousand dollars were whispering in his ear. The clock said 4AM.  Kyle hadn’t slept a wink. 

Tomorrow would be the start of torture. Judgement. He was a failure, a burnout and- Kyle pulled on the shirt Alan had lent him and snatched the money from the nightstand. The addict crept up the stairs, past the living room and out the front door. They’d left the alarm off.

Around five in the morning Alan saw Kyle on his kid’s swing set, smoking a cigarette he’d pawned off someone and not dressed for the weather. Neither of them said anything until Alan sat down beside Kyle on the shorter swing.
 
“I thought you’d left.”

Kyle took a long drag before offering the cigarette to Alan. “Me too.”

Alan hadn’t smoked in years, but he accepted the cigarette.  “Ready for tomorrow?” 

“No,” Kyle admitted and shivered.

“Wanna go inside?” 

“No.” 

“Cool.”

Alan was going to drive Kyle to detox before work, and they’d both made it to the car on time by not sleeping. 

Veronica ran out of the house, bleary-eyed and in a robe to give Kyle a hug. “Thanks for proving me wrong this time,” she said as her goodbye and good luck.
