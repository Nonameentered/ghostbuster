Shannon was going to force something to go wrong today. It couldn’t be that hard, right? In fact, Shannon knew it was a Monday and what she’d read about the past told her that Mondays were previously the worst. Shannon *adored* Mondays, but she wasn’t about to let that stop her.

When citizens of Station MX-13 turned 17 years old, they were allowed access to the archive of the old world. For most citizens, this was a curiosity to be ignored, but Shannon enamoured herself with the music from the past and discovered emotions that had been discarded as useless.

Heartbreak, tragedy, disappointment, melancholy, Shannon had listened to soft guitar strings that whispered legends of these feelings to her, but she’d never had a bad day herself. In fact, Shannon had never heard of anyone having a bad day on Station MX-13.

It was time to change that.

Shannon convinced herself that the breakfast her robotic caretaker, Helena made for her wasn’t precisely what she wanted, but it was pancakes and honestly who could resist that? A pancake-filled morning could still result in a bad day by bed. Right?

The caretakers were annoyingly understanding when Shannon announced that she was skipping school for the day. Shannon knew that school was too much fun and that, if she went, it would absolutely make her day and positively pummel her plans.

When Shannon wandered the streets during the afternoon she ended up with nothing to do. Every option she considered would have been great, which was bad. She couldn’t go SkySkiing™️ without loving it, or experience a reality simulation without being stimulated. Shannon’s options were simply slim, and she was running out of day to ruin.

An hour later, Shannon admitted defeat.

On the far side of the station, Shannon was alone with nothing to do but wait for her failed bad day to be over. Shannon sulked; then she caught on that she was successfully sulking. Absolute success. Avoiding everything had let her catch a bad mood, that was wonderful, Shannon smiled.

Back in bed, Shannon went to sleep proud of her subversion. She'd mastered a bad day. Shannon closed her eyes, accomplished, pleased and content.

Shannon’s neural implants noted that she went to bed happy, and the caretakers added it to the record, making the score for Station MX-13 542,253-0.
