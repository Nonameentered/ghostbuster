I didn't know if it counted as a Summer Vacation to meet with the guys at the latter end of September but it was what we had going for us. Allan worked a job that didn’t give good vacation time and Cam had needed to help his inlaws move. I’d needed time to ensure that I was ahead of work before I headed out, and Kyle needed to find a weekend his parents could watch Ellie on. 

But hey we’d made it, and sometimes that was all you could expect
. 
The cottage we’d rented for the past eight years was closed after the end of August so we’d settled for something a little closer to the city. That part had been disappointing but at least the house came with a bedroom for each of us instead of a set of bunks. Maybe we could get used to that new part of the tradition.
 
The second night of the trip Kyle had headed off to bed early and Cam had found himself in the middle of a back-and-forth text chain between Erica and her parents and next thing we knew he’d been inside instead of on the porch for the past hour and a half
 
In that time Allan and I had killed several drinks each while vaguely staring at the stars and talking about nothing. At one point he’d picked up his guitar and played something small out, but he was out of practice and annoyed himself out of playing. 

“Do you think this is the last one?” Allan asked as he put down the guitar against the unfamiliar railing of the rental house.

“No,’’ I snap responded without really processing the question. Took me a second to realize that I was pretty sure I was lying about that. “Maybe.”

“Yeah,” Allan sighed before heaving himself out of his chair to get another drink. “Do you want another?”

Short answer. No. Long answer was that I didn’t want to stop tonight and head off to bed yet. “Sure.”

“Cool,” Allan handed me one of the eighteen cans left in our ambitiously packed cooler and I accepted it, but didn’t open it quite yet. “Summer ain’t quite the same eh?”

“We’ve got more going on now,” I admitted. 

“Remember Key West?”

“Dumb question.”’

“Fair,” Allan shrugged and cracked his own can open, “man I didn’t think eight years would change it so much.”

I had two options there, and I chose humor over sincerity, “I didn’t think Kyle would make it eight years after throwing up in that parking lot.”

Allan didn’t respond, instead he kinda just offered a ‘hm’.

“but yeah, didn’t seem like we’d be wresting with kids and shit,” I pointed out.

“Well we’re not.”

“Fair, don’t know how long that’ll take,” I cracked open my drink and took a sip to fill the silence instead of actually wanting one.

“It’s different,” Allan finally added, “but it ain’t bad.”

“We’ll make it work.”

“Probably.”
