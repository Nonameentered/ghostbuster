I died with my sword in my hand, a thousand miles away from my home and buried under the blood of friend and foe. I felt my last breaths leave my body, and everything faded to a calm black, like an empty night sky.

Days, months or years later, an angel woke me. A brilliant warrior clad in silver armour and standing prouder than the mightiest king. He offered me a hand, and I knew I was being brought to my true fate, to fight the evils of the afterlife with my God's other glorious servants at my side.

I never made it to the eternal battlefield. Instead, the angel brought me to a quiet place, a soft meadow overlooking the living world. "You shall care for the creatures here," the angel commanded before letting go of my hand.

This wasn't the eternal battlefield, so I interrupted the angel, committing blaspheme to his face. "What did I do wrong?" I asked, "how did I-"

"Nothing wrong, my child," the angel answered.

"Look at my armour and sword,"  I said, pounding my plate-clad chest, "witness my dedication to the lord," I shouted, pointing to the gaping wound where my eye should have been. "I should be fighting! I would be an asset on the-"

The angel stunned me with their cool gaze, surveying me and then whispering. "I'll see what I can do, but there are no mistakes." He ascended into the infinite sky with a single mighty wingbeat, leaving me alone in the meadow.

At least I'd thought I was alone. As I cursed my luck and fate, something sniffed behind me. I turned to see an ancient hound, with a grey snout and tired eyes meandering his way over to me. As he approached, he stared up at me, and his tongue dripped out of his mouth in an attempted smile.

I sat down beside the dog, and he laid beside me. Hounds were good creatures, loyal and proud. They were assets on the battlefield and allies in the home. I don't know how long I sat beside the old dog because the sun never set at my new home, but my beard grew long, and his breathing grew stronger.

Eventually, the hound leapt up from my side, suddenly young. It scampered around me several times before jumping up towards my face and licking the soft scar where my eye should have been. I grinned. A job well done. He was a good boy, and some part of me knew he was ready. The hound sprinted off towards the edge of the meadow and out of my sight, off to somewhere where they could eternally play.

The cat that came to me next wasn't old, but she was surely blind. She tapped her head and paws against my greaves, figuring out where I was and how to interact with me. Cats were good hunters; they were assets on the farm and allies in the home. I welcomed her onto my lap and spent time with her. I talked to her about mighty battles, about the children from the village that I wouldn't see again and about how much she would have loved my wife. Before I was ready to stop talking, she sprung up from my lap, a spry-lithe thing and met with eyes with recognition. She ran off to the edge of the meadow, out of my sight and off to somewhere where they could eternally play.

The next friend I made was a Raven; pristine save for an arrow through its heart...

The puppy didn't approach me, so I went to it. It cowered in the corner of our shared meadow and looked at me with pleading eyes. I took a knee in front of it and reached out my callused hand. The dog snapped at my fingers, trying to sink teeth into my battle scars. I pulled my hand away, and it cowered.

"Poor thing," I whispered before approaching with my other hand, "life was hard, wasn't it?" I left my hand in front of the puppy's nose, vulnerable and open. They sniffed the hand before resting their head on it for a brief moment. After a quick second of trust, the puppy recoiled, "it won't be hard here, I promise. I'm right here." I lightly scratched under the puppy's chin until its will softened, but it needed space.

"Hello again," a voice of silver and light that I'd heard years ago called out to me. The angel that had brought me to this meadow was waiting for me in the middle of it. I stepped away from my new friend to talk.

"I'm sorry," I started, "if I am needed on the front, I will go, but I still have so much work to do here," I bowed my head to the glorious angel.

"Do you wish to go to the front?" the angel asked.

"If I must."

"That wasn't my question."

I looked toward the puppy, who was taking cautious steps on his own around the meadow for the first time since he'd gotten here. "He still needs me," I finally answered.

"I know," the angel said with a kind nod. "There are no mistakes."
