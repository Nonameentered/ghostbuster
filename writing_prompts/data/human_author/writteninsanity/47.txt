Alex sat in a plush chair across from a woman with the disposition of a haunted 18th-century lighthouse. The woman, Dr. Connors, stared at a survey he'd taken earlier during his stay at the Rothchild Society for Wayward Characters.

"Well, Alex," the woman opened, and she placed the clipboard in her lap and neatly folded her hands on top of it. "I believe I've discovered your deficiency."

Alex winced at the word, there hadn't been a lot of bedside manner at Rothchild, but that was close to a new low. Finally, after a moment of Alex waiting for Dr. Connors to elaborate, he chimed in, "What is it?"

"What would you say your motivation is?"

Alex squinted at Dr. Connors like it would let him see a hidden message in her question. "What?"

"What's the one concrete goal that drives all of your actions?" Dr. Connors 'clarified,' she then pulled out and clicked a pen, clearly expecting a solid answer.

"Uh-" Alex took half a second and several more 'uhs' before finally asking, "One?"

Dr. Connons clicked her pen twice.

"I don't think I have one of those."

"Then how is anybody supposed to empathize with you?" Dr. Connors asked before picking the clipboard off of her lap and turning it to Alex. "All of this is a mess. You need to have focus."

"I-" Alex considered the answers the Doctor probably wanted to hear and how to get to those without lying. "Maybe you can suggest some?"

"A girl," she offered.

"Definitely not."

"A boy?"

"More likely, but there is more to life th-"

"Revenge?"

"For what?"

"Saving the world?"

"From what?!"

"Discovering treasu-"

"If I may?" Alex asked. Dr. Connors nodded to let him go ahead. "Are you seriously telling me that everything I do should be towards a single want?"

"Yes," Dr. Connors put the clipboard down again, "anything else would be inefficient storytelling."

"I-" Alex caught himself, "What's yours?"

"I want to find love," Dr. Connors answered with all the enthusiasm of a mortician.

"You're kidding."

"It's arduous, but I crave the sensual touch of another," Dr. Connors elaborated. Alex wondered if she was cold reading a script.  "What is your core motivation, Alex?"

Alex took a second to consider. "I don't think I have one of those."

Dr. Connors frowned, "In that case, I have no other conclusion than a diagnosis as a fallback character, to be used in writing prompts and short stories as a placeholder but never as a narrative core."

"Please," Alex pleaded. "I just need more time; we can explore deep concepts and-"

"Don't make this harder than it needs to be, Alex," Dr. Connors said with a curt nod as she got up to leave the room. "Characters know what they want. Those who don't should at least know their place."

"Dr. Connors if I cou-"

"Sorry Alex, I have a date. Goodbye. I suppose I'll see you in another vignette."
