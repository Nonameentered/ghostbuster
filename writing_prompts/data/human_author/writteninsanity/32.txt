"So what are you going to do then?"

"Oh, family business."

"No shit!" Theresa beamed, "powers came in then?"

"Yeah, little late but, you know it's better late than never."

"You gonna do the Toronto circuit?" Theresa asked.

"No no, Mom and Dad are still here, I'm just an apprentice right now but I might be able to pull off a Portland or something."

"Don't do Portland," Theresa waved at Ryan to get him to sit down on one of the bar seats at her counter. "Magmaquake is an asshole."

"Sharkfear is in Portland now, Magmaquake is in-" Ryan paused to think for a moment while taking a seat, "I wanna say Seattle."

"Magmaquake isn't Seattle material," Theresa sighed, before frowning, "You know it's weird not knowing the politics right now but I'm not really allowed to talk to anyone about this stuff."

"Sorry?" Ryan suggested.

"No no," Theresa put her hands in her pockets, "it's good to know I guess."

The basked in that silence for a moment before the kettle started to make a soft roar.

"So what brings you here Ryan?"

"Um," Ryan tapped on the counter and ran through all the other options he'd gone over before this one and they suddenly all seemed like very good ideas. That said, it was too far into this plan to back out now. "I think I need your help."

Theresa snorted.

"I do," Ryan repeated.

Theresa frowned. The kettle beeped to let them know the water was boiling, and Theresa poured some tea. Just when the silence was starting to get a touch too long, Theresa spoke up. "What do you need?"

"I-"

"I'm not killing anyone," Theresa amended.

"What?"

"I'm not killing someone," she repeated.

Ryan blinked twice, "I wasn't going to ask you to."

"Good," she said, "not allowed."

"I don't think you were ever allowed to kill people."

"Well I did a lot of things that weren't allowed before-" Theresa held up her wrists to jingle her cuffs. "I don't do stuff like that anymore."

"About that-" Ryan started.

"What?"

"What if you did?"

"I can't and, more importantly, won't do a comeback tour," Theresa took a sip of her tea. "I'm mostly trying to accept how things wrapped up and I don't think it'd be better the second time. Ya know, even if I could."

"That's," Ryan swallowed a sigh, "Never mind then."

"You want me to do one?" Theresa came around the counter to sit beside Ryan, "Why?"

"Mom and Dad are-" Ryan drummed his fingers on his mug, "never mind, it's a mess," Ryan went to stand up and Theresa put a light hand on his shoulder to keep him down.

"My house. Talk about it."

"Just-" Ryan took a sip and found some courage. "They've been so snippy and shitty to each other lately and it's fuckin hard to be around."

"Okay."

"They're just bored and they've decided that the other one in the problem. So they're just pecking at each other because they don't have anything else to fight and you of all people know how combative they are-"

"Mhm,"

"So now Dad's sleeping on the fucking couch and Mom keeps going to visit Abuela on the weekends and it's been like this for months and I don't know what to do because nothing I do makes it better. I just get to sit there during dinner while they snip at each other and continuously prompt me to take a side in the whole thing."

Theresa whistled out a 'phew' and took a sip of her tea. After Ryan's words stopped echoing around the house she frowned. "So I'm not a marriage counselor."

"Well I need to do something," Ryan pointed out.

"Okay so-" Theresa turned the touch that was keeping Ryan from standing up into a soft pat, "Not to bang on about how much I've been going to therapy but you don't need to do anything."

"But-"

"You might be really invested in your parent's happiness, but you're not responsible for it. You are three separate people and I know it's hard to think of each of you outside of the unit but you're more th-"

"but-"

"You're more than just their kid," Theresa continued, "and-"

"But"

"Okay Jesus on a stick. What?"

"I thought this would work so-"' Ryan swallowed spit, "so I really committed to this idea already," as he spoke, Ryan reached into his pocket and produced a small silver key on a gold chain. Theresa's eyes lit up.

"Is that-"

"Yeah," Ryan sheepishly answered before putting the stolen key to the power binders on the counter, "like I said I really committed."

"You're dead if they find out," Theresa pointed out.

"Ohhh yeah," Ryan nodded.

"But there's a problem," Theresa pointed out.

"What?"

"I'm rusty and I lost last time around. I don't think I'm really going to solve anything-" Theresa stood up with her mostly full tea and walked over to the sink.

"Oh," Ryan said.

"Your parents are pretty cool though, and I like you" she continued before putting the mug down in the sink. "So I'll do it, but-" she tailed off on the caveat.

"But what?"

"I'm gonna need backup Ryan and-"

"Oh god."

"Sunk cost," Theresa said with a wink that betrayed swagger she hadn't had in four years, "so what exactly can you do?"
