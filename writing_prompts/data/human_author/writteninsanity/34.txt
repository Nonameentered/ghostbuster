Andrea poked her ski pole through the top layer of icy snow every three or so feet, trying to tap the ground hidden under the powder beneath. For the past two days she'd meticulously covered the upper half of the small block of trees she'd used to call a park. 

Poke.

Poke. 

Poke. 

Thunk. 

Andrea sighed and stabbed twice for good measure, feeling the same block each time. Finally, she pulled away the ski-pole and stared down at the glassy frozen eye she'd revealed. Gross. 

"Hello," Andrea offered as a muffled greeting as she shrugged her bag off of her shoulders. It was one of those huge bags, the kind that her dad had really been into but had just seemed gratuitous up until she'd suddenly needed to carry something like a pickaxe, which Andrea fished out. 

"Happy new year," Andrew wished as she swung the pickaxe in a practiced overhead arc, slamming it into the face of the buried corpse with surprisingly little resistance. It was almost terrifying how used she'd gotten to feeling the pushback of a skull against her Lowes-sourced 'ice breaker', but at the same time she tried not to juxtapose her current life with her old one. It got depressing. 

Thick, ichor-like blood drooled off the tool as she yanked it from the ground and started trying to wipe it off on the snow. That was one more annoyance that wouldn't wake up in early March. 

Course the weather would have been nicer then. 

Once she was convinced the pickaxe wouldn't smell *too* bad, Andrea shoved it back in her bag and grabbed the ski-pole again, continuing her march down in a straight line. The frozen crunch of her snowshoes kept time. 

At the end of her path, just before she was about to turn around and start again five feet to the right, something caught her eye. A door. More specifically a closed door. 

Save for a scant few shelters in the arena, which Andrea knew by heart, doors were supposed to stay open during the Winter months. Keeping the temperature down in buildings kept the Zombies frozen, something as simple as a closed door and good insulation could end up with someone bit when they thought they were safe in mid-January. 

Sometimes a door blew shut, sometimes someone closed it out of habit, and sometimes luck just had it out for you and a zombie shambled into it, either way, Andrea broke her pattern to walk across the street to the mysteriously shut building.

Once she was closer she noticed that the windows were intact as well. Great. 

Andrea grabbed her pistol off of her hip and quickly ensured that it was loaded. During the warm months, guns were emergencies only, because they called more problems per shot than they solved, but during the winter there were way less problems stalking about.

Along the same line of thinking, Andrea stopped at the door and knocked. Maybe someone was just taking a look inside for firewood and had closed the door to keep warm?  Either that or they were just taking a break. Whatever it was, if they were a proper human they would answer the knocking with something other than a-

*SLAM* 

Well. That Answered That. 

"I'm gonna have to ask Liam if anyone else was around here," Andrea sighed. When had she become the group Mom? It wasn't time for that sort of question though. 

Andrea slipped her gun back into its holster. No need to waste ammo, and fished her pickaxe out again. She'd technically been out hunting anyway, she just hadn't expected quite this much excitement. 

If you could call one Zombie excitement. 

Just when she was about to open the door and let this zombie tumble out into the snow, Andrea looked at the next building during her steeling breath and noticed that it, and the next three buildings in either direction, all had their doors closed and windows properly open, like it was supposed to be...

This surprise guest wasn't a coincidence. Someone had set up the conditions for this bastard to warm up and be a nasty surprise.

Andrea put her pickaxe back into her bag and ended her day early. Opening the door to a trap seemed like a bad idea, but telling the group about it, would help them prepare for what was coming. 

Someone was stepping out of line.
