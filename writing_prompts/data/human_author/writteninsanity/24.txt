We'd tried so hard to get to any other point than this, and now that we were here I didn't know what I was supposed to be saying, or feeling. 

Boxes stacked in your office didn't make me want to cry or sing. It was an end and- well I guess I didn't really know how I felt about ends at this point. We'd talked about it being right, but if everything was muted I just agreed with you by default. It stopped the fights. 

There was a lot of romantic notions about fighting for one another, but I was just done fighting. Maybe I'd wasted all of my time and energy fighting you? I didn't know, I'd never really been the one fighting, I'd just been trying to get the noise to stop.

So you were gone, and I'd cried about but- I was just tired and going through the motions. I'd been a month since you'd decided to leave and you were still here. At this point it was whatever.

What was going to happen once you were gone? Our friends were your friends. You'd always been the bigger personality, towering above me and- I'd felt like I'd always been at home as your compliment, but that's not something that stands alone. 

So now I was going to be a complement about nothing, which matched how I felt. I'd just be there.

I'd just be. 

Just be anywhere that wasn't beside you, because maybe if I took some steps away from you the air would be a little bit clearer. 

I don't know if your hand wrapped around mine was a set of choking vines, but you'd decided that you wanted to leave either way, and as usual, I didn't have much of a voice about it. 

I'd survived. Maybe I'd bloom somewhere else, maybe I wouldn't. I just didn't know how I felt about ends anymore.
