"So sorry I am late, Congressman," I called, slipping through the steel door as it hissed open. "Unfortun-"

"Don't worry," the Owl-like Adrivan answered from behind his desk. "Everyone has a run-in with predators now and again. You were coming from Earth, right?" the representative from Kyldan-Alpha didn't bother looking up from his datapad as he spoke to me.

"It was shuttle issues, actually," I corrected. "Wait," I stopped myself from just leaping forward to business, "did you say, predators?"

"Of course," he said.

"Sorry," I stated, "sorry if it wasn't in your brief, but there aren't any active wars on Earth at the moment, so I don't worry about predator drones," I clarified. After a second of silence from the representative as he was reading, I went to slip into the chair across from him.

"Yes, I'm well aware of your peaceful status, or we wouldn't be talking," he said, "but come on; Every hatchling has a story of a narrow escape or dramatic encounter. Right?" The Adrivan finally looked up from his datapad and met my eyes with his two dinner-plate-sized ones. "Tell me, what are human predators like?" he asked, "Avian maybe?" The representative chuckled to himself after the last part.

"I think it would be mostly mammalian," I pointed out, "I don't have the statistics on whether there are more shark attacks or-"

"How can you not know?" he asked while turning back to the last piece of work he had to get to before me. "Have you really been lucky enough never to see one?"

"Okay," I put my datapad down on the table and waited for him to be done with his last signature. "You're suggesting that predators are a daily occurrence for you?"

"Of course," he said, "need to watch the skies on Kyldan."

"I-" I stopped and thought about it for a second. "We don't have that," I finally pointed out.

"Pardon?" the Representative pushed his datapad to the side.

"We don't have something hunting us. We haven't for thousands of years."

"What?" the Representative did the closest thing that he could do to a frown and then, "what happened to them?"

"I believe we killed most things that wanted to kill us," I pointed out, "almost as soon as we made weapons."

"Ah, so you went to war, and now they're extinct. Bravo."

"Not quite," I corrected, "they could have gone extinct, but we have Natural parks and reserves dedicated to ensuring the survival of endangered species."

"You protect them?" he asked like the suggestion was wild and unheard of.

"Yes."

"How do you contain them?"

"Fences and occasionally less if it's at a zoo."

"What is a zoo?" the Adrivan asked while picking up his datapad to look it up.

"A place where families and kids can go see exotic animals. Some of which are predators."

"YOU SEND YOUR CHILDREN TO THEM?" the representative almost shattered his datapad from slamming it down on the desk.

"They're safe." I pointed out.

"How are they safe?"

"There is glass sometimes," I explained, "or we occasionally just have the animals in a pretty big hole that they can't jump out of."

"So you've trapped them?" he asked. The idea that we were trapping the animals seemed to calm him down a bit. "So then they will starve and-"

"We feed them," I pointed out.

"Why would you feed them?!" the Adrivan riled himself back up again, his snow-white feathers shaking with confusion and frustration.

"So they don't die."

"You feed them other humans?"

"No just general, meat."

"They don't eat humans exclusively?" he asked.

"No."

"You are their preferred prey though."

"Absolutely not."

"What do they eat then?"

"Well, I think Lions eat Gazelle, Sharks like seals-" I started.

"Those are multiple animals."

"Yes."

"Do they eat people?" he asked.

"Well, they can, but they don't really. It basically never happens. If one gets too aggressive, we just need to put it down."

"How complicated is that process?" the Congressman asked.

"Not too complicated," I explained, "I believe most of the time we just track down and hunt the animal humanely."

"Wait. You hunt the predator?" he asked.

"With guns," I pointed out.

"Firearms work on them?"

"Yes."

"So you're-" he paused, "does anything hunt you normally?"

"No," I answered.

"Ah, you're an apex species," he said while turning back to his datapad, "that explains a great deal about the number of wars you had pre-first contact." He typed several things in on his datapad and then looked back up to me. "Well, pardon the conversation there; curiosity got the best of me. Now, about you being the first human to visit Kyldan."

"To be clear," I said, "there are predators on Kyldan that regularly hunt you and can't be killed with traditional firearms?"

"Yes, that's the galactic norm. Apex species are the outlier."

"Thanks for the clarification," I said politely as I could. Now I just needed to figure out how to get out of going to a planet full of bulletproof death birds...
