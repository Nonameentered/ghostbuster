"Painting is rubbish!" the boy cried. "I want to go step on some ants."

His eyes glistened with a fervor I could recognize from history books and documentaries. But his feeble boyish voice drowned his outburst in bathos and I couldn't help but smile. "Let's get crazy. Why don't you draw some ants? You can do whatever you'd like to them."

The boy looked up at me, suspicion unfolding gradually mixed with a confused sense of wonder. "Ants? Who paints ants? Can you do that?"

I shrugged. "I don't know. Can you?"

A breeze blew by as the sun cast glitters in the river next to us. The boy dipped his brush in black paint and stood before the easel, hesitating. "I just ... paint?"

"You just paint."

A black splosh. Two more. Thin, stretched lines of legs and antennae. The boy added some brown and some red. "The young ones are the color of honey," he said shyly.

"You are very observant. Why don't you add some? Ants get easily lonely, you know."

"They do?"

"They sure do."

The boy painted more and more ants, old and young. Soon he had an entire canvas colony and he struggled to find the space for more. "I think I am done," he said.

A wasp sat down on the boy's brush, and he jumped. He shook the brush as if he were a conductor attempting to drive an orchestra into madness. "Go away! Go away!" He cried and tears ran freely down his face. The wasp deftly avoided his attack and landed on his upper lip. The boy smacked himself with the brush and the wasp took off.

He looked up at me, paint-mustached, and a restless shiver went down my spine. I had almost forgotten who this boy would grow up to be. "Wipe it off," I said, and the harshness of my tone seemed to frighten him. He did as I said and I breathed out a deep sigh. "Enough with the ants," I said. "Let's paint some flowers."

"I don't like flowers," he said.

"Paint them well, or I will drown you in the river."

The boy laughed, then stopped when he saw I was not joining in. "You're not being se--"

I slapped his cheek. "Paint. Paint as if your life depends on it."

He did as I said. I was pleased to see he was improving. Days turned to weeks and the young boy seemed to flourish. Would this be enough? I could not say for certain. The lone wolf responsible for that tragic incident, could that really be the child with eyes glimmering with hope?

When it was time for me to return, I made him swear that he would stay on this path. That he would pursue a career as an artist. He swore that he would. And that was all I could do in the time I had. Would it have been better if I had simply drowned him? No. I could not entertain the idea seriously, and it went against everything I had ever believed in.

Back home, after stepping through the portal, I hurried to check the news. But something was different. The world around me had ... changed. A sense of deep alienation overcame me and a fear began to grow: I had made a serious change to the course of history. I had not simply prevented the terrorist attack. I had triggered the butterfly effect, the ramifications of which could be so vast that I--

My hands. They were ... translucent. My parents were never born? I did not have a right to exist in this version of the future?

I spent the last of my time searching for the name of the boy who in the world I knew grew up to be a lone wolf. To my horror, I saw that everything had changed. The terrorist attack never happened. But the boy ... He grew up to be something much worse than what I could ever have imagined.

That feeling must never have left him, that desire to step on ants.

As I sensed that my end had come, I left the world with a simple whisper: "What happened, Adolf?"
