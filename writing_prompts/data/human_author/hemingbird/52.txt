Whenever my grandmother got angry, it was like there was lightning all around her.

"This yoghurt is flavorless! What does this company think, that I eat yoghurt for the *texture*?"

My mother used to tell me she had mellowed out since she herself was a little girl. I never quite believed her.

I remember asking her for help drawing up our family tree for a school assignment. She'd had a couple of glasses of wine and clapped her hands together like a rockstar on stage before throwing everything she had into a fairly strange doodle. Satisfied, she said, "There's our family tree."

"That looks more like a ... building."

My mother laughed. "A tree can't be a building?"

I didn't know what to say.

"Look. The pillars came out real nice, didn't they?"

She had drawn some cylinders with squiggles on them on top of which was a triangle. "Maybe I'll ask dad if he can help me," I offered.

"No, no, no. I'm not joking around. This is our family tree. Wait, I'll get your grandmother."

My mother wheeled her into the living room and it didn't even interrupt grandma from her knitting. Did she even know someone had moved her?

"Look," said my mother. "Calista wanted to know about her ancestry. I drew her a map."

Grandma frowned and put down her knitting tools. She lowered her glasses over her eyes and took a look. Suddenly, she froze. "Basilia! What are you thinking? Don't fill Calista's head with that nonsense."

"It's not nonsense!" my mother countered. "Remember when you told me? After having a bunch of these?" She pointed to her glass of wine.

Grandma sighed. "Fine. Calista, you want to know about your history?" She took the glass from my mother's hand and had a sip.

She looked at me as if she was high up on some mountain, staring down at a pitiful creature. Sort of unsure, I nodded.

"That--" she said and pointed to the drawing, "--is the Pantheon."

I tried the word out a few times. It had a funny feel to it. "Is it a village?" I tried. "In ... Greece?" I hadn't been given many details, but I deeply suspected our family to be Greek. Well, we were the Smiths. Which didn't quite fit with my theory. But still.

Grandma cackled and wiped a tear. "A village! The great Pantheon. Den to pistevo! No, child. The Pantheon is a symbol. The symbol of my home."

I got an F on my assignment. When mom wheeled my grandma through the hallways of my school, it felt like the building might spontaneously tear itself apart. The day afterward, my teacher changed my grade to an A. His face was pale as marble. When I asked him why, he just said, "Y-Your grandmother explained some things to me. I am deeply sorry."

She has been gone for a long time now, but I think she's still around. One day, I heard some strange noises from the kitchen and I opened the door to find my mother arguing with an eagle. "The neighbors are going to think we're crazy! We can't have big birds flying around inside. What if someone saw you through the window?" The eagle brought its beak to my mother's glass of wine and drank from it. My mother didn't seem to mind. "And what about Calista? She wouldn't understand." She sighed. Then she saw me.

The eagle fluttered about in a less than elegant fashion, crashing into our refrigerator. My mother patted its bald head and opened a window. The eagle fled and my mother flashed me an awkward smile. "How ... much of that did you hear?"

"Enough," I told her.

We didn't speak of it again.

Some days, when there's a thunderstorm, I think of my grandmother. I see her knitting in her wheelchair with furrowed brows. I see her eating yoghurt with the scrutiny of a sommelier. I see her as an eagle, soaring across the skies and keeping watch over us.

I hope she's happy, back home in the Pantheon.
