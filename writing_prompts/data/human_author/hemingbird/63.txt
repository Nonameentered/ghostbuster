"Another glass of delicious milk. Just the thing to moisten my bones."

"Yes, quite. I was just thinking I might have a calcium-replenishing juice myself."

The human in front of me had no idea. I played him like a fiddle instrument.

"There are sometimes cows."

"Yes. Sometimes."

He had legs and arms and a hat. His nostrils were normal.

"The sun. Wouldn't be a day without the sun."

"Darn. My radiation banishers. I left them at my house place."

"I have an extra pair of radiation banishers. Here, borrow them."

He expertly handled the anti-sun instrument, as humanly as possible. How many of us were there left? How many aliens?

The human stared directly into the sun with the aid of the radiation banishers. "It's round, like an eyeball."

"Yes. Like the eyeball of a sun person."

"Is your religion the sun person?"

Damn. Religion. That was not a topic of study for my preparations. "My religion is the ... moon person."

"Exciting. The moon person and the sun person are both religious figures. And both are round."

"Both are round," I concurred. Luckily my cover door hadn't been blown open by the suspicious wind.

"There are many round things."

"Yes and also there are things that are not round."

It was just pleasant human conversation talk. Should I risk it and attempt a hostile benevolent takeover of his corporeal form?

"I have depression."

I was startled by the frank admission of the human.

"No more serotonin molecules?"

The human shook its head sadly. "No more."

Strangely, I felt as if I wanted to do comfort with the human. "But there is calcium."

Smiling, the human said, "Milk."

Such a good-natured human. Perhaps I would let it keep riding its life cycle.

We drank the rest of our milk drink in silence. The sun person seemed to wink at us. It was a good day.
