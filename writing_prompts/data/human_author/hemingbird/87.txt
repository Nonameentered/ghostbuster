*The discovery of gelatinous ions in Reykjavík in 2032 proved to be a watershed moment for all of humankind. Suddenly, superfluidity engines were more than just a theoretical physicist's wet dream—they were the dry reality for scientists across the globe. PI Lella Númadóttir distributed the work of her lab freely and in so doing ushered in a new dawn and era of technology.*

"Can we skip past this? We've seen it like a million times already."

Bonny Sleggings raised her VR bucket up slightly, exposing her almond eyes. Outside the Nebulaship, the dark void of space beckoned. She glanced at the darkness, and she sighed. "This is like forcing someone to read terms and conditions. It's illegal."

"First of all, young missy," said Sirloin Clamp, Vice Tutoring Instructor of Educational Hub #67, "Making someone read terms and conditions is not 'illegal'. It's mandatory. You know very well what happened to Dr Númadóttir. It would be disrespectful not to honor her memory."

Bonny groaned and under her breath she said, "Yeah, but do we have to honor memory every fracking time?"

Cliff Thundertowel threw her a smile. "You don't actually have to listen. You can just repeat the word 'fish' in your head over and over. That's what I do."

"Mr Thundertowel! Do I have to remind you that your VR helmet registers your brain activity? If I wanted to, I could isolate the brain activity corresponding to the concept 'fish', and I could have it deleted. Is that what you want? A lifetime of not knowing about fish?"

Cliff gulped. "No," he said quietly. "I want to know about fish."

"Good," said instructor Clamp. "Then let's proceed."

*A rogue Luxembourgian scientist, Luca Flonk, exploited Númadóttir's technology to provide totalitarian dictator Phlelp Phillips with superfluid human-combustion engines that were used to quell the uprising of Borovian fast food workers who protested against their replacement with burger-flipping robots. Phillips fueled his army of robots with the bodies of disenfranchised franchise workers but ultimately became, himself, bio-fuel and also burger meat. Flonk would later attempt to murder Númadóttir during a zero-gravity dance contest, but—*

*Fish*, thought Bonny. *Fish, fish, fish*. Floppy fish. Bouncy fish. Fat fish. Thin fish. She discovered quickly that she had a low threshold for semantic satiation. Was 'fish' really a word? Why was it so weird? Did repeating something over and over reveal its inherent absurdity? Was that what mantras was all about? Did Buddhist monks go 'aummmmmm' because this shattered the fragile illusion of the self?

Buddhist fish.

Fish going 'aummmmmm'.

*—and that is how the entire nation of Finland became digitized and now only exists on a set of servers located on Saturn's moon Titan. That concludes our introduction to the life and work of Lella Númadòttir. Please enjoy your visit to pre-warp planet Earth.*

"Finally," said Bonny, exasperated. Her VR bucket made some clacking noises and her head felt like a lump of second-grade space clay. It was showtime.

When she opened her eyes, she was having coffee with five pumps of vanilla syrup at a Berlin Tsarbucks. She could remember her name—Bonny Sleggings—but nothing more. Except the number of syrup pumps. Muscle memory. Or regular memory. She stroked her chin gently and squinted her eyes, but this didn't really help her remember anything.

"Verzeihung!" she said, waving her arm at a waitress. "Warte, welche Sprache ist das?"

The waitress scoffed. "Es ist Deutsch, Idiot."

Dutch. Of course. She was in the Netherlands.

Bonny rubbed her hands together. She now had a list of 420 things she wanted to do.
