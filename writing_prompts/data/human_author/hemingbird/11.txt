# Part 4

"I'm sorry for calling you an inanimate object," said Johngermany.

"That's quite alright. This is a place free from judgment. Express yourself however you like."

"No, I'm sorry. That was uncalled for. I guess some stuff got dredged up. I usually don't curse. I've got principles and ... you've got to stick to your principles. You know, it's funny. This all takes me back to that day, to my ma and my pa—the air aromatic with the scent of $5 tequila, lime, triple sec—it's all there with me, still."

"Sounds like a core memory. Do you believe it might be connected with your drinking?"

"Huh? Oh, no. I don't think so? That was just a temporary crutch, something to lean on after ..."

"It's okay."

Johngermany adjusted his tentacles on the chaise longue, he studied his claws. "They were so happy, you know?"

"Of course they were."

"To me it was only natural, it was all I knew. But now, looking back ... I can't imagine what it must have been like for them. And when I left? They must've been so scared. But I just had to get away. 'These people are not my real parents.' That was what was going through my mind. I'm sorry."

The therapist pushed a box of tissues towards him.

"Oh. Thanks." He grabbed one. "I just wish ..."

"Go on."

"I just wish I could've had some more time with them. You never know that soon it's going to be too late." Johngermany sighed. "I met him, you know."

"Who?"

"Patrick. The Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young. As soon as he saw me, he took off running. You've got to realize, the Cxaxukluth Act had just passed and he was on the hook for hundreds of suits for child support. It took some time to convince him I wasn't after his money."

The therapist's eyes widened though it was apparent she had years of training in the art of not looking shocked. "What did he say?"

Johngermany shook his head. "He ... Well, I asked him. I said, 'You're my true father, right?' and he kept saying that he wasn't, that it was a special case. That my parents had made some sort of deal."

"A deal?"

"Yeah ... You see, Patrick had returned a week after my birth. He wanted to squeeze some money out of them, threatening to take the child with him. But they didn't have any. So he asked for something else instead. Their souls."

"Their souls? Don't tell me that they—"

"They took the deal, those idiots. My idiot ma and my idiot pa." Johngermany tried to fight the tears, but there was no use. "Those idiots gave him their souls just so they could keep me."

He grabbed a bunch of tissues and buried his face in them. "By the way," he continued. "I should probably tell you: you've been cursed."

"What?"

"Yeah. By Uvhash. The Blood-Mad God of the Void. I can see curses. That's my inheritance, I guess. Just thought you should know."

"Oh."

"Yeah."

That night, Johngermany went back to the apartment, the place where he was born all those many years earlier. He put on a movie and he made himself a cocktail. *In Bruges*, and a margarita. He made the drink in a cup: World's Best Dad it read.

"J-Johngermany?"

It was his mother's voice. But how!? "M-Mom? Are you there?"

"Hey! This is an *excellent* movie! Nice choice, son!"

"Dad? Where are you?"

Johngermany looked up and there they were. Floating midair. "Mom! Dad! W-What's going on?"

"I believe, uh, that you've been cursed," said Caroline.

"Oh, is that what's going on?" said Paul. "That makes perfect sense!"

"... Does it?" said Johngermany.

"I don't know!" said Paul. He sounded very excited.

Caroline laughed. "So *that's* what Pat ended up doing with our souls! He turned us into curses."

"Wait," said Paul. "D-Does that mean ...?"

"What?" said Caroline.

"I'm ... I'm an inanimate fucking object!" He pumped his ghost fists in the air. Caroline sighed.

"Mom! Dad!" Johngermany broke into tears as he embraced the ethereal forms of his parents with his tentacles.

"Aww, come here son. We love you. We love you very much."

"I know," said Johngermany. "And I love you too. I love you both to pieces."

They didn't notice it, but outside the window flew an enormous bird. In its beak it carried a bloodied sweater vest.
