God nursed a shot of Fireball looking down in the dumps.

"I didn't know they served alcohol here," I told him.

He looked up at me with an expression of raw disgust. "It was an espresso shot. I turned it into Fireball. I'm God. I can do that. Don't you idiots know anything about miracles?"

I looked over at Sam, the barista. He shrugged. His promise of unlimited cold brews if I could convince The Creator of All Things to leave now didn't strike me as the enticing offer I'd considered it moments earlier.

"Wow, miracles. That's ... pretty cool. So, what's gotten you so glum? Trouble in paradise?"

God rolled his eyes. "You rib-people are all the same. Think you can win me over with a little joke?" God scoffed. "I've heard them all."

"Rib-people? Do you mean 'women'?"

"Look," said God and took a fiery sip of his shot. "I made Adam and I thought it was so cool. Then I thought it would be nice if he had something to do with those dangly bits between his legs. It was just a mistake, originally. A hiccup. But contrast, you know, that's something every artist makes good use of. So I took a rib and I fleshed it out. Bing bong bingo--rib-people. Inverted Adams. Madams. I never should've done it. It ruined the whole thing."

I tried not to take offense at this. "Is that what's bothering you? Women? I mean, rib-people?"

God snapped his fingers. "Gar√ßon! Another ... espresso shot."

Sam breathed a deep sigh. He gave God his drink and pulled me aside. "I told you it wouldn't be easy. He's been here for weeks and he won't take a hint. You might as well give up."

Vigorously I shook my head. "Not a chance. I think I know how to turn the tables around."

Raising his hands in front of his espresso shot as if making some spell, God grimaced and said, "Ehhhhh. Fireball."

The dark color of his drink gave way to a radiant orange. This time he downed it all in one go.

"Easy there, tiger."

God flipped me the bird. "Mind your own business, McRib."

"You know what? I think you're sad because your miracles are all mediocre."

This caught his attention. God slammed his divine fists on the table. "Mediocre? I invented mediocre. It's the color beige. And I invented it!"

I shrugged. "Only goes to prove my point. What sort of all-powerful creator sits down and invents ... beige?"

God arched his brows. "Everyone loves beige. It's the color of everyone's favorite texture: sandy. That's why I made a buttload of deserts, stretching on for miles and miles. People love it. Ask anyone."

"Everyone, raise your hand if you love the color beige," I shouted. Not a single hand went up.

God looked flummoxed. "... You don't like beige?"

A 3000-year old lesser demon said, "Eh. It's no blue, I'll tell you that."

Standing up enraged, God said, "Blue!?"

"Or red," said an imp.

God pulled at his majestic white hair. "Red? Those are both so *basic*. What's the matter with you people?"

"Ahem," said the demon. "We're not all people. Some of emerged from the fiery pits of hell, thank you very much. Without any help from you. I tell you, Satan really has a sense for aesthetics. Look at these horns. You'd probably put them on a duck or something."

The coffee house erupted into laughs. Sam smirked from behind the counter.

"Horns aren't cool!" cried God. "Well, maybe they would be cool on ducks. Yeah, you know what? They would be really cool on ducks. Imagine them running around with horns. That sounds awesome."

"Bet you'd make them all beige," said the imp, rolling his eyes.

God burst into tears. "That would be the coolest part of it. Fine! I'm leaving. I don't want you hang out with you losers anyway."

As The Creator of All Things stormed out, Sam let out a sigh of relief. "Thank you," he said. "I guess I owe you a cold brew."

"You know what? I think I'll have an espresso shot instead."

"Or maybe ..." Sam leaned down behind the counter and emerged with a bottle of Fireball. "It's on the house."

"Thanks," I said. "You're a miracle worker, Sam."

As I sipped and winced, Sam asked me how I knew God would be so sensitive about his work.

"It was simple. From the way he talked it was obvious he was the sort of guy who couldn't handle a bit of ribbing."

Sam laughed. "Thank God he left. Shots for everyone!"

We all cheered and celebrated but only for a few moments because right then and there everything in the entire world turned beige and a duck with horns walked in, quacking with contempt.
