Athena's favorite book is *Starship Troopers*. Her favorite animal is the honey badger. On Bumble, she sums herself up with the following three emojis:üç∑üåµüê∏. Oh, and she's a Goddess of War.

She messaged me after we matched with a GIF of a mushroom cloud, rising and rising in the infinite regress of GIFs. I responded with a happy turtle. She sent me a bunch of ????s. wats with the tortle, she wrote. I responded with another turtle, an angry one. i dont understand. what does the tortle mean??üò©üò© she wrote. It's just a happy little turtle, I said, and for a week I didn't hear from her. Then she showed up at my doorstep.

She's standing there right now, with a bag in her hands. She says it contains all her belongings. I'm moving in, she says and she's all chipper and sunshine.

That's a bit sudden.

That's war. Suddenly it's at your doorstep. She punches my shoulder. Sorry, she says. Old habit. Pain is normally how I greet people. Her eyes are big and blue and filled with a sense of wonder that takes my breath away.

Well I guess you can come inside, I say, and she does. She comes inside and she starts moving all my stuff around. My porcelain pigs. My tractor magazines. My ornamental lamps. What are you doing? I say.

Oh, it's sort of my MO, she says. My modus operandi. I turn things upside down, you know. If something's meant to be on a cupboard, I feel like it should be on the floor.

Oh, I say.

She asks me if I'd like to share a bottle of wine with her. It's from Greece, she says, but the label says Ohio.

We drink and watch Japanese game shows for a while, and I can tell she's on the edge. Something seems to be bothering her. I ask her and she lets out a deep breath, sips some wine, breathes in and sighs all over again.

The turtles, she says. I can't stop thinking about the turtles. Was it like a hypnotoad thing? After you sent me those GIFs of turtles I couldn't stop thinking about, thinking about the happy one and the angry one--they showed up in my dreams. Do you know how many turtle wars I've started in the past week? Hundreds and hundreds. There's been turtle genocides, you know, all because of those GIFs.

What?

I thought maybe you'd put a spell on me, some turtle kind of spell. They're all old and ancient, and probably there's magic in them. I met an old woman once, with warts and all that, and she would carry this turtle shell around. I'm pretty sure she was a witch. I thought maybe you were a witch too, or a wizard maybe. A wizard of turtles.

I scratch the back of my neck. You weren't kidding about the goddess of war stuff? You're Athena, the deity?

Yup yup she says and she sips some wine. Well, I'm not *that* Athena. Not the one you keep hearing about. Not that I'm a lesser Athena. Just a different one, you know? She sips her wine, but the glass is empty. She holds it while waiting on a lone drop.

I don't really like having my stuff all over the floor, I say, and she frowns. It's just, I'm not a messy person. Really. I like having my rooms tidy. And not all war-like.

So why'd you send me those turtles?

Sorry?

If you didn't want to have me in your life, why did you seduce me with your turtles?

I didn't.

What?

I didn't seduce you with turtles. I just sent you some silly GIFs. I like turtles. And porcelain pigs.

She says no no no over and over. Not again, she says. I always do this.

Do what?

I get all excited and I lose sight of things. The fog of war, you know?

Oh.

She puts her head on my shoulder. Japanese game shows are chaotic. Sort of like war. But not as violent.

That's true, I say.

I really thought there was some deep meaning to those turtles. But in the end, they were just turtles, weren't they?

Yeah. But they were cute, though.

Yeah, she says, the goddess of war, and she yawns. They were pretty cute.
