# Nixed

It was my first job, so I thought nothing of meeting with six different lawyers and signing three separate confidentiality agreements. As far as I was aware, it was standard procedure. One of them would put his lower lip inside his mouth and suck on it as if it were a piece of candy. "You realize the consequences of talking to anyone about the things you see here? That it would mean you willingly forfeited your life?" I gulped and nodded and the lawyer smiled. Thick saliva ran from his evacuated lip. "Good. We have reached an understanding."

Inside the facility, the light was dim and the mood morose. A man missing an eye and wearing the same uniform as I, albeit a dirtied one, came up to me. "Fresh meat? Why did they hire such a young one?"

"I-I'm Leon. Davis." My extended arm lingered in the air. The man observed it as if it were some sickly protuberance, possibly malign, extending from my body.

"No one bothered to tell you? We don't do that here."

He was a bear of a man, with the latter half of his face somehow drooping while the upper half stayed put. His nose, a bridge between two worlds, seemed to have been broken on multiple occasions.

"I'm sorry," I said. "I didn't know."

The bear introduced himself as Jeff. He led me down the hallway, through four differently-shaped doors, until we finally arrived in front of a fifth one with light glowing from its edges as if trying to escape imprisonment. "This is it," he said, and from the hint of a smile on his face I could tell something was up. Nothing, however, could have prepared me for that sight.

Unlike the rest of the facility that I had been through so far, not even the faint memory of a shadow could survive in this room. There were spots on all four walls and also in the ceiling and on the floor. Even on a row of pillars in the middle there were lamps hanging haphazardly and their lack of organization, so contrasted with the rest of the room, made me think it was the guards who had decided to put them up though I couldn't say for what reason.

"It's bright," I said.

"Yeah. No shit, Frankenstein."

I wasn't sure if he really confused the legendary theoretical physicist with Mary Shelley's mad scientist, or if it was a running workplace joke. Maybe it was something they all did. Maybe I should try to think of one similar to it. Or would they just think I was trying too hard to fit in?

The strangest part of the room was the absence of anything being lit-up. Tears streamed from my cheeks from the brightness, but it remained a question mark. At the far side of the room was a red door. Whatever was contained within, I figured, had to be the answer.

Jeff didn't seemed bothered by the light. Not at all. He didn't even squint. Which likely meant he had spent a lot of time inside this room. Which confused me. I couldn't see a purpose to it. Yet Jeff had grown so accustomed to it that its brightness failed to have an effect on him, and surely this meant that something important happened here. I looked around for clues. That's when I spotted a single drop of dark red blood behind one of the lamps. Then I looked at Jeff's uniform and I saw one similar to it. "What, are you queer or something?" Jeff hissed, and this sudden outburst alarmed me. Well. He wasn't *wrong*, but he was certainly not my type.

"I was just wondering about that door," I said, and I pointed at it.

"Yeah, yeah. We'll get to that. It's funny. You spend some time crying in here at first. The light's a bother. Then later, they're the ones crying. It's funny, in a way."

... Was torture part of the job description? Internally, I cursed myself for skimming through it. But I had to remain strong. I got this job to support my little sister. To make sure she had a normal childhood. At least considering the circumstances. So they played rough with violent criminals? Was that really such a bad thing? Whatever they did to end up here, it must have been even worse.

Something else struck me as odd: all this time we had seen neither prisoners nor other guards. It was  a huge building, sure, but who would waste space like that? Was everything behind that red door? And what I had been through now was recreational facilities and a well-lit ... enhanced-interrogation chamber?

Unlike the other doors we had been through, this one demanded a security pass. Weren't they worried about prisoners breaking free through the door behind us? As Jeff beeped his card against the machine, I caught a brief glance of it.

'Henry'. The name on the security pass was 'Henry'.
