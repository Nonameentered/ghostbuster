Pilpo once stole a tomato in a village raid and it stood proudly on a cave stone for weeks before it went bad. "Good raiding," elder Gilgich had told him when he returned with the oversized cherry. "Keep that up and you will be head goblin one day."

After that day, he had invented a new walk. Something to distinguish him from the rest of his litter. It was swanky. Like the human vegetable guardians. His cousin Blurg had said of his walk, "It makes me think you are some *new* kind of goblin," and ever since Pilpo had remained in a sort of trance.

Pilpo was watering his now-stinky tomato, trying to help it spring back to life, when Adora walked in on him. She had the greenest legs a goblin could ever want. Her teeth spiraled every which way, splendid and yellow, as if sculpted by the primordial goblins themselves. 

"What are you doing?"

"Oh, I'm just watering my loot."

She smiled. "You must have been scared."

"Scared?"

"Yeah. Running away from all those humans."

In fact, none of them had given chase. With great stealth, Pilpo had reached for the wooden container of tomatoes in the place of the market, but it was too high up. He stood there, jumping, and all of a sudden a tomato fell onto his head. "Oopsie," the vegetable guardian had said. Before she got the chance to reclaim her treasure, Pilpo had seized it. And strangely, the human villagers had pumped their fists and clapped as he raced back home.

"The only thing I'm scared of is being crushed by the weight of my own ambitions."

Saying it felt good. But the look on Adora's face after he said it felt not-so-good. "Oh," she said.

"Forget that. Want to grab some grub?"

"Sure," she said and as they walked Adora put his hand over her shoulder.

"W-What are you doing?"

"I know you are a hero, but even heroes need some support when they are hurt."

"Hurt?"

"Yes. I could tell from the absurd way that you walk."

Pilpo and Adora became an item and elder Gilgich turned out to be right: Pilpo took on the role as head goblin and under his rule the raids grew more frequent and more bountiful. Over time it became clear that the humans did not particularly mind their raids. They would offer them candies and beer and give them pats on their heads for good luck. "We consider you our mascots," said one of them, and Pilpo understood at once the significance of this word he had never heard before. Mascots. Protectors of humanity.

He wasn't quite sure *how* they were protecting the humans. Didn't they just steal their food? Somehow, they did it in such a way that it made them feel protected. Pilpo had a deep conversation on the topic with elder Gilgich before he passed, and the elder had said, "They must have sensed our honorable spirits."

One day, dark smoke flew by the goblin cave. It came from the direction of the village. The humans. They were in danger.

Pilpo assembled a team of the finest goblins one could ever desire. Bulb, Blurg, Hakko, Zeb--they were raiders and warriors through and through.

"Be careful," said Adora and there were tears in her eyes.

Their children, innocent little gobs, cried because they were afraid something would happen to their dear father. "Don't worry," said Pilpo. "Everything will be just fine."

The goblins raced to the village carrying buckets of water. When they arrived, they saw the humans standing still around a great fire. They were terrified and could not even act. They simply gazed at the flames and held hands for comfort.

Pilpo ran between their legs and he threw the water at the flames and following his example the others got to work as well. At first, the humans looked puzzled. They had been convinced that this fire would be the end of it all, and they were not prepared to be rescued. Certainly not by goblins. Soon their panic turned to ecstasy as they realized that their mascots with honorable spirits had come to their aid.

The humans snapped out of their state of helplessness, and they hurried to join the goblins in their efforts to put out the fire. It didn't take long before they were all throwing water at the flames and little by little it surrendered to their valor and all that was left was ash and smoke.

Pilpo, Bulb, Blurg, Hakko, and Zeb were tossed into the air and celebrated as heroes. After, they were welcomed to a feast. Pilpo was amazed to see how quickly they had prepared it. They dined like kings and once they were full they said their goodbyes. "Here, bring some home for the rest," said a vegetable guardian and she gave them tomatoes and potatoes and broccoli and other valuable treasures as a reward for their good deed.

They returned to the goblin cave triumphant. Adora gave Pilpo a hug and a kiss. "You are surely the bravest goblin who ever lived."

The goblins held a celebratory feast. Pilpo made sure to save one tomato, and as he placed it on the familiar cave stone he became misty-eyed at the memory of elder Gilgich. "Your honorable spirit lives on in me," he said, and he thumped his chest.

As the goblins danced, sang, and laughed, Pilpo could feel the warmth of the primordial goblins in his heart. They were protectors. Mascots. And though they had no swanky walk to show it, Pilpo somehow knew that they were all some kind of new goblin.
