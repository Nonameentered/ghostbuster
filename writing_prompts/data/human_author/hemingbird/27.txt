Zombie-Claire prepared a gin fizz with all the elegance of a rat in a blender. "Grrgh?" she said.

"On the rocks," John replied. He looked up. "Thank you."

"Grrgh grrgh." Zombie-Claire nodded, but as often happened she got stuck. She kept nodding and nodding and if John wasn't there to disrupt her she'd keep nodding until her head fell off.

"You always were a creature of habit," said John. The stench of death and rot was sickly sweet and kissing her was like sticking your head into a garbage bin and frenching its contents. Yet, he persisted. Because she was still here. She was still with him.

John fished out the eyeball and threw it back to the reanimated corpse of his late wife. "Here, I'm throwing you a glance. Get it?"

"It's clever."

"Yeah, I think so too. Wait. Who said that?"

John turned around in his chair to see the apparition of Claire hovering in the air. "Having fun with my soulless husk, are we?"

Zombie-Claire groaned in the background, confused; likely, her festering neural synapses lit up with the recognition of her form. "C-Claire. What are you doing here? You know this place is off-limits to you. The decree—"

"You can shove the King's decree up my ethereal rear, John. I thought I'd check up on you. I didn't expect this. You were, after all, adamant you could never replace me."

John stood up. "And I haven't. See? That's you. That's your body." He pointed to Zombie-Claire, who had gotten stuck in a loop of blinking her eyes and rubbing them. They had both fallen out already. "Uh, wait." John rushed over and plopped them back in. "It's alright, dear. Don't worry. The mean ghost lady won't hurt you."

"John!"

"What?"

"'Mean ghost lady'? Is that how you think of me?"

"No ... Of course not. But Zombie-Claire, she doesn't understand. She's like a child."

"Oh, John ... That's not right."

"No! Not like that! We don't do anything of that order, if that's what you're getting at. She makes drinks, she cleans the house, she gets the mail. She's like a—"

"—like a servant? Is that it? You're happy that I'm dead now that you have my body all to yourself?"

"I never said that! It's just ... It's just ... I'm lonely. I miss you. And what was I supposed to do? The King's necromancer came parading through town and he gave me a hefty discount. You know I've never been able to resist a bargain."

"And you don't think my consent enters the conversation at all?"

"Your consent? What about Zombie-Claire's consent? She's sentient. According to some criteria."

"It's my body!"

"It *was* your body. Now it's mine. Legally speaking. I have the paperwork to prove it."

Zombie-Claire prepared a Manhattan and shyly offered it to Ghost-Claire. "Grrgh ..." In lieu of an olive was an eyeball threaded halfway through a toothpick.

Ghost-Claire sighed. "I expected better of you, John."

"Well, you shouldn't have."

With that, Ghost-Claire drifted back into the ether. John nursed his gin fizz and sighed. Had he been wrong? Zombie-Claire crawled around on the floor, looking for her missing eye. Bits of flesh fell off in the process. Soon there wouldn't be much left. "Perhaps I ought to turn myself into a zombie as well. We could be zombies together. And ghosts together. You'd like that, wouldn't you?"

"Grrgh," said Zombie-Claire. "Grrgh ..."

John took a deep breath. He would summon the necromancer in advance, leaving the payment on the kitchen table. Hopefully, he wouldn't just take the money and run.

Zombie-Claire found her toothpicked eye and jabbed it back into its socket. "Not too bad. Maybe we should do the same with the other eye, so you don't lose it again."

She nodded, and she didn't stop nodding. She was stuck in the routine, a deadly looping of rotten flesh. A rigor mortis of action. And so was John, he realized. Was he not already a zombie?

He watched her nod throughout the night until, at last, her head really did fall off.
