The voodoo doll, all plush and silence, stared at me with cloth eyes. "This is not weird. I'm not being weird."

The doll of my father said nothing.

"You're the one with kidney stones. And you're just a doll. It's not like I'm ..."

My father cried last time we spoke, he spoke fevered about a kidney stone the size of the Ritz. "They can't even break it apart with lasers. It's too big. The pain is abhorrent. Dear Christ our savior, I can't stand it."

"This too shall pass," I said, and I pointed in the general direction of his urethral woes. He blinked, hesitant.

The doll came equipped with doll-sized equipment. I had inserted a Pop Rock inside it, and all I had to do was to remove it. The question was only: how?

I had no desire to fondle my father. Freud had been all wrong on the topic of the Electra complex, at least as far as I was concerned. I would be his lithotripter. I would remove his gargantuan kidney stone.

There was the option of just crushing it. But there was a risk that I'd be crushing more in the process. Was it better to leave him to suffer? No! I would remove the kidney stone, and that would be all.

But how?

The thought occurred to me that I could just remove it the same way it entered. Voodoo dolls obeyed not laws of physics but laws of metaphysics and as such my exact manipulation would not render an exact replication in my father.

I gave the doll a fair shake, and the Pop Rock fell out. I glanced at it for a few moments, then annihilated it with my elbow. It was overkill, and I hurt my elbow in the process. But it was done. The Pop Rock had been destroyed. But had the effect transferred?

"Oh! Hi, Beth. How are you?"

"I'm good." My father sounded alright on the phone. "How are your kidneys faring?"

There was a sigh. "Well, yesterday I nearly passed out in front of the TV, but today ... It's almost as if it's not even there."

I stared at the voodoo doll with heartfelt gratitude. "That's great!"

"Yeah," he said, "but my back's killing me."

I gave the doll a chiropractic crack.

"Ow! What the heck! My back. Huh, it's all fine now. Can you believe it? Just like that."

"Just like that?"

"Yeah! I guess I'm a lucky guy."

"I guess you are. Well, I have to run. Good bye! Love you."

"Love you too sweetheart. Take care now."

Satisfied that my witchery had proved effective, I placed my father's doll gently back in the cabinet. There they all were. All my friends and relatives. All taken good care of.
