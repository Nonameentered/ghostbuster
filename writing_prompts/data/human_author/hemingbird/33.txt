# It's Okay to be Isekai'd

I am always folding laundry. In my dreams, in my house, and I even run through the order of operations in my mind while sitting on the bus like some weirdo solving an invisible Rubik's cube. The trick is to fold it all into tidy rectangles. Rectangles are to a housewife what hexagons are to honeybees.

I am walking down Kuyakosho Street in Sumida-ku, Tokyo. There's an Enedo gas station to my right. It’s red and composed of aesthetically-pleasing rectangles. It warms my heart.

The sky is the color of my favorite fabric softener, LAVONS’ Blooming Blue. The whirr of traffic around us makes me think of stage 11 out of 12 on our washing machine; a quiet hum rising and falling like the steady breath of the world itself. I close my eyes, and I fold laundry in my mind.

“Ehhhh! That kid’s running straight into traffic!”

“Idiot! Idiot! Get out of the road!”

A red ball. A white van. For a second, I’m back in school, back in Mr. Takeuchi’s classroom with white chalk dust dancing in front of a green canvas. “Miss Ine!” he says, gravely, “You cannot divide by zero! It is a terrible crime!” And I feel in my heart that this is an equation like this, that a red ball plus a white van is forbidden mathematics. A terrible crime. Division by zero. So perhaps that is why I run. Perhaps it is to prevent a terrible crime. Perhaps it is to please Mr. Takeuchi. I cannot be sure. All I know is that for a small moment there is a boy being pushed out of the way and the person who pushed him appears to be me. Around me are frightened cries. And while the van grows larger and larger, I cannot see the red ball. It has disappeared. I take a deep breath. This is what happens, I think to myself. This is what happens when you divide by zero.

I wake up to a pair of immense breasts, tethered to a wide-eyed woman. “Huh?” she says. “Where did you come from?”

Mountains clothed in fresh green. An emerald sea. Clouds passing quietly above. “F-Fuji-san,” I say. “Where’s Fuji-san?”

The woman who might or might not be hiding watermelons under her kimono says, “Fuji-san? Who is that? Is he your magic instructor?”

Mount Fuji is nowhere to be seen. The 3,776m active volcano, the tallest peak in Japan, the gentle titan resting in the background of Katsushika Hokusai’s The Great Wave off Kanagawa—it has disappeared. Am I even in Tokyo? What are these mountains around me? What is this sea? Who is this … buxom stranger?

“I am just a poor village girl,” she says, as if on cue. “I haven’t seen much of the world. I’m easily impressed. I’ve always dreamed of a handsome stranger sweeping me off my feet, preferably one from some distant land.”

“I’m from Tokyo.”

“Where’s Tokyo?”

“It’s in Japan.”

“Where’s Japan?”

“It’s in … East Asia.” I bite my tongue, hoping she’s at least heard of that one. If not …

Maybe the white van knocked me out, and the driver for some reason decided to bring me deep out into the country. Maybe as far as Nerima. And this girl is a bumpkin. Didn’t she mention magic? Yes, she was surely an idiot.

“Asia!” she says, and she beams. I let out a sigh of relief. “Of course I know Asia. She’s my favorite necromancer.”

“Uh, what?”

“She once brought my neighbor’s cousin’s friend’s cat back from the dead! Asia Deathlace—she’s one of my favorite adventurers.”

So she’s not only an idiot, she’s delusional. Just my luck. My husband and my kids must be at home, worried. They’re probably sitting in front of the dining table right now, confused as to why the food fails to materialize. “Try clearing your throat,” Hiroto is probably saying. “That usually works. You clear your throat and then the rice and the soup and the pickled vegetables come flying in their bowls.” I imagine the three of them clearing their throats, in a circle of confusion, chanting like monks trying to reach enlightenment.

“Your clothes are really weird,” she says.

I am terribly offended. This white shirt has been expertly ironed and my black skirt runs all the way to my ankles just like it’s supposed to. And what about her? She’s wearing a pink kimono and there’s a giant red ribbon in her hair. She looks just like a country bumpkin after her first visit to Akihabara. “I saw this exact outfit in a popular magazine in my dentist’s office. He is a particular person, he doesn’t leave arbitrary magazines lying around. He is a man of taste.”

“Magazines? Dentist? You talk funny. You must come from … some distant land.”

There are stars in her eyes. The sight of it sends a shiver down my spine. “I’m just a housewife,” I tell her. “I was on my way home, when …”

And then it hits me. Well, it hit me earlier. The white van. It came racing down the road at a great speed. There’s no way I could have survived the impact. Does that mean … I died?

“A housewife,” says the woman and she scratches her chin. “I am not familiar with that class. What powers do you have?”

“Folding … laundry?”

She snaps her fingers. “A folder! Just like Asia Deathlace! I knew it. I knew the two of you must somehow be related. I’m Detresia Glinx. Pleased to meet you.”

“I’m … Hotaru Ine.”

“What a strange name! I’ll register you in my Dream Device.”

Detresia pulls something out of her white bag. It’s a red rectangle. She clicks it and it makes a sound, a quiet hum. There are tears in my eyes. I suddenly feel scared and lonely. I have died and now I’m in a strange place where people have names such as Detresia Glinx and they have weird red rectangles. I close my eyes, and I fold laundry, desperately. I fold and I fold and I fold.

“Eek! Be careful!” Detresia cries. “You are folding flames all over!”

I look up, and I see fire. It dances in front of me. Detresia runs in a circle around me as the flames make a retreat.

The red ball. The white van. It was a bad combination. Is this what you tried to warn me of, Mr. Takeuchi? Is this what happens when you divide by zero?
