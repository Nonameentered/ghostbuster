I was watching the woman fish paper notes from the river when the sea dragon broke the surface of the water like the post-impact skywards explosion of a meteor.

The river Yath is deep. If you were a rock, it would take you 45 minutes to fall to its bottom. I know this because I have been a rock. I have been many things. Many, many things.

"Erkh! G-Go away! S-Scram!"

The green-blue monster of the abyss didn't seem intent on following her commands. It tilted its head and its scales glittered like mana from cracked runestones. Then the sea dragon opened its bedaggered mouth and I thought to myself that this was a fair conclusion. She was annoying. Very, very annoying. Unfortunately, that was also when she spotted me behind a knee-high fern up the hill.

"Help?" she said and her eyes welled with tears. She was wearing some sort of red hat, presumably fashionable in the citadel from which she came, and her long, black hair flowed beneath it.

I shrugged.

Would it be morally permissible for me to morph into a fern? The woman deserved a mysterious experience like that, something beyond explanation. But I'm sure what people actually like about mysterious experiences is the feeling of them simmering in the backs of their minds, the way they enrich life by showing you that there's something more, beyond it all. If a mysterious experience is your last one, it's more likely that all you will feel is: terror.

I slid down the hill faster than I had anticipated. I was planning on stopping the beast with my feet as the woman braced for teethy impact, then I'd give her a silly wave, show her that I was the kind of adventurer who dealt with stuff like this all the time. I certainly wasn't planning on slipping inside the jaws of the sea dragon as if it were the entrance to some horrific theme-park ride.

Sea dragons are mostly throat. Pink, smooth throat dripping with stomach acid. The type that burns you. It feels a bit like friction. Even when you're nothing more than a suit of armor, it burns.

I morphed into a chair. Then a fern. A sword, a boulder, a chimney—in desperate situations, this happens. You roll the mimic die in an attempt to solve the problem with a helping of chaos. It wasn't working. I kept sliding down sea dragon throat. Then I thought about stuff that doesn't belong in throats. I turned into shards of glass, windpipe-clogging toys, hot tea. The monster didn't seem to mind. Then I morphed into a wraith pepper sauce.

The wraith pepper can kill a goblin with a sniff. Well, I mean the goblin has to sniff it. The pepper doesn't sniff anything. But if the goblin sniffs the pepper: it dies.

Being a liquid is not very comfortable because you are a constellation of particles loosely glued together like some big family celebration and there's nothing worse than that, of course. One particle wants to go this way, another says here's better—and you are all of them. When you're a fixed object, a solid chair for instance, it's all harmony. Everything is the same. It's like a group of people singing the same song over and over and everyone loves it. It's spiritual, in a way. But when you're a liquid ... Well, that's a different matter.

I must have greatly irritated the fleshy walls of the beast's throat, because soon I was hurled in the opposite direction. Oh, how I flew. As a mimic, I'd never experienced human birth. It sounded strange. Awkward. A person pushes you out through a tight and obscene canal and that person is your *mother*. This feeling of being pushed out from the sea dragon's throat, it made me think that perhaps I now knew better what it was like being human. This was that thing they sometimes talked about: birth trauma. And I nodded my head as I flew upwards because this whole experience was indeed traumatic.

Right before being ejected, I morphed back into the good old suit of armor. As I crashed into the bank of the river I realized that my transformation might have been slightly premature. Well, this was my birth, wasn't it? Sometimes births were premature.

The woman screamed. She stood there, collecting wet paper. I was gobsmacked. She hadn't even escaped?

Steam piped out from the sea dragon's ear holes and it opened its jaws wide and dove into the river. Presumably to drink all of it.

"Y-You saved me," said the woman. She adjusted her hat.

I nodded. Then I flashed her a thumbs up.

A piece of paper gently drifted across the waters. She jumped in after it. I dragged her back up by her boots. "Argh ... My work ... Oh. You must think I'm crazy. But these notes—I'm working on the story of the century. An exposé of the greatest monster of the realm, and it walks among us! An impostor in the midst."

I was well aware.

The woman laughed. "You just saved me from that big snake like it was nothing. You're a true adventurer. You just dove straight into its mouth! Just like that. I was amazed."

"These notes," she said, holding a bunch of wet paper so damaged it was basically porridge, "they contain all the materials I have so far. The monster can transform into a chair, a fern, a sword, a boulder—even a chimney! A farmer down in Brewse told me he returned to his cottage one day after a long day's work in his fields. Something was off, he felt, but he couldn't tell what it was. It wasn't until the day after he realized that his house had never had a chimney! It was the monster, hiding on the roof. But now I can't even remember the damn farmer's name ..."

I nodded my head in sympathy. Jonhamore Ruefling had decided to let me remain as his chimney for a few days because a family of purplebirds had made me their nest and he liked purplebirds because they liked the taste of the worms eating his crops.

"I was hot on his trail," she said.

Moments earlier I'd literally been hot down a trail, I thought.

"The story of the century!" she screamed and she reached her hand towards the skies in a manner so theatrical I figured she'd probably make a better playwright than a journalist.

"Now I will never find him. Or her. Or they. How do you refer to a mimic?"

I shrugged.

She sighed. "Right. You don't know. No one knows. I was hoping that I'd find out, that I would expose this horror once and for all. And everyone would think I was ... a hotshot reporter." At the sound of these last two words she broke into sobs.

While she was crying, I transformed into a fern.

When she looked up, she seemed confused. "A-Adventurer? Where have you gone? Are you there? Wait. Did I dream it all? No." She covered her mouth. "Does this mean ...?"

She stared at me. At the fern. It was clear from the mad passion in her eyes that she was having a mysterious experience. I was happy for her. I hoped she would let it simmer.

The woman stood up and she flung her notes into the river Yath. Between her sobs, she laughed. "What a thrill!" she cried. "What a thrill!"

I morphed into a chair. Exhausted, the woman sat down. It took her a few moments.

"Wait. Where did this chair come from? And the fern ... Wasn't there a fern?"

She squealed in terror and she ran up the hill, clutching her red hat. Her black hair danced in the wind.
