"Fear tastes good. Sugary sweet. We hope you will have more fear in your heart. We will make sure of it."

Leona Krexler woke up realizing she had just flung her phone out her apartment window. "Hypnopompic defenestration," she mused. She had always had a talent for naming various natural phenomena. When she was four, she described her babysitter as 'mostly hippo' and all but the babysitter agreed that it was apt.

Why did she throw the phone away? Oh, right. The alarm. In order not to develop a Pavlovian response to any song, she had written a script that would fetch a random song from her library every morning. She had forgotten the one song by Cannibal Corpse Matthew had sent her a week earlier.

As she prepared to leave for work, she remembered the fragment of a dream. About creatures who feasted on emotions. She sighed. So her imagination decided to run wild with their recent scientific breakthrough. Great.

"Oh, Krexler. You look unusually ... haggard."

Matthew sat at his desk, eating soup from a glass jar. Leona glanced at herself in the dark mirror of his computer screen. "It's your fault, actually."

He opened his mouth wide and let out an exasperated sigh. "How can it be my fault?"

"Your cannibals ..." she said, pointing at the t-shirt hidden under his lab coat. "They woke me up. Do you know what I did?"

"Tell me."

"I threw my phone out the window."

Matthew howled with laughter, spilling soup all over. Then he screamed, wiping the expensive electronics in a hurry in case the director should be nearby. He looked over his shoulder and just at that moment, he stepped in.

The director saw the mess and he just nodded. "Seems about right," he said.

"Leona!" cried Matthew. "You spilled soup all over my gear! Director, I've tried to steer her in the right direction. Again and again I've told her soup doesn't belong in the lab. It's not a wet lab. Well, I guess it's one now!"

She punched his shoulder. He let out a meek cry.

"Enough," said the director. "This isn't the time to be playing around. It has been confirmed. Retaliation has begun."

At first, Leona assumed the director was talking about budget cuts. When she got into science, she didn't know how much time was spent on budgets and grants and expenses. You couldn't even buy a pencil without filling out paperwork. But from the grim look on the director's face, it was clearly a serious matter. Would they be shut down?

"Retaliation?" said Matthew. "Who's retaliating?"

A sorrowful expression dominated the director's wrinkled face. "We don't know."

He explained that it was about the research. About the outgoing signals humanity had been sending out all this time, out across the Heffler field. Quantum information theory had blossomed in past decades and little by little researchers uncovered its subtleties. Particles are actually excitations of fields, hills in landscapes of pure information. And activity across these fields can spread like ripples across water or neural activity during an epileptic seizure. That's why we can detect stuff like gravitational waves. But until Jonah Heffler came along, no one had anticipated that emotional waves spread across the universe in an analogous fashion.

Leona clapped her hands and squealed. "Does that mean that we have detected alien emotions? Their sorrows, their joys?"

The director gazed out the lone window in the lab. "No. We have not detected emotions."

"But you're saying we received signals from the Heffler field, right? How can it be anything other than emotions?"

"Emotions are constructed from various elements, such as valence and intensity. The difference between anger and rage is intensity, for instance. And it seems that the signals we are receiving are exclusively signals of intensity."

"But that ... doesn't make sense."

"Shit," said Leona. "Feedback amplification."

Matthew stared at her. "What?"

The director carefully nodded.

"If they're sending just intensity, that's the same as turning up the volume. Emotionally speaking. Which means that anger will become rage, sadness will become depression, fear will become—"

"—*terror*. What's worse is that the frequency is aligned in just that direction. There is currently a planet-wide amplification of fear and we don't know why, whoever they are, they are doing this."

Leona let our a chuckle. "That's scary stuff."

"The newspapers are going to *love* this," said Matthew. They're going to get so many clicks."

"It's not funny," the director snapped. "Our planet is, for the very first time, at war."

As the director put it like that, Leona remembered her dream. And she experienced that smörgåsbord of sensation--goosebumps, spinal shivers, sweating, a racing heart, breathlessness, an upset stomach--all more intensely than normal.

It had begun, she realized. Whatever this was, it had begun.
