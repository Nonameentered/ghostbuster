Rufus came into my life as a rescue.

My mother was a nurse with a heart of gold that far outweighed her allergies. When I was 8, she came into my room, sneezing, and she said, "I have a surprise for you, William."

Because of my mother's allergies, I had given up on the idea of owning a pet that didn't swim around in a fishbowl. Secretly, there was nothing in the world I wanted more than a dog. And when my mother presented me with Rufus, I assumed her knowledge of my dreams was due to some divine motherly gift far beyond the understanding of little boys. It was only years later, as I cleared out our old house, that I found the hundreds and hundreds of drawings I had made. All with me and imaginary dogs in all sorts of colors.

For the longest time, I believed she did what she did because of her illness. Sickness triggered in her an almost spiritual yearning for sacrifice. It was not something I would have been able to understand in my younger days, how suffering for those you love the most can produce heights of happiness unlike anything else. I miss her dearly.

As the years went by, I grew older. But not Rufus. No, he stayed the same. Even now he's sitting at my bedside, panting with his big old tongue hanging out to dry, and he hasn't changed one bit from when I first met that day when I was 8.

There were several incidents as a child that made me worry about Rufus. He would disappear, for months on end, and just as we gave up on hanging posters and contacting far-off shelters on the off chance he'd wandered far from home, he'd come right back. And each time he looked the same as when he left, showing no signs of struggle.

My father assumed Rufus had a second family somewhere in the neighborhood. As it turned out, he didn't. But my father? He did.

One day, he never showed up to pick me up from the school. We were going to the hospital and I was very worried. So I raced home and our house was empty, except for Rufus. When he saw me, he ran and I followed. He led me to a little, yellow house quite a distance from ours and through its living room windows I witnessed a birthday celebration. The boy looked about as old as me. And they all looked so happy. My father got a big hug from the birthday boy and right then he spotted me and Rufus hanging about in the gardens. I will never forget his face. For some reason I still can't understand, I smiled and waved at him. The little boy saw me, and he waved back.

I ran as fast as I could with Rufus following along, leaving a trail of tears all the way to the hospital. A nurse recognized me and again I saw almost the exact same expression as that of my father. "Are you here alone, William?" she asked me.

Some hours went by in the waiting area. I read comic books and Rufus took a nap. Then my father arrived, at last, and that's when he told me that my mother was dead.

Rufus got me through that difficult time. Without him, I would have been utterly lost.

Last week I finally learned the truth about him. How he remained young. Where he'd gone those times he disappeared. He had gone to see someone. I know because this person came to see me too.

And he told me Rufus had been the one with a sickness. When my mother rescued him, she rescued him from Death. She traded her health for his and that is how he has been able to stay with me this whole time.

When he went away it was to accompany lost souls, wherever they may roam. My mother had insisted on this when she made her deal with Death.

Soon I will meet her again. And Rufus will join me. I wonder if he'll still make her sneeze.
