Jonathan Seaworth flipped his burgers the way he made love to his wife: with a distinct look of disgust plastered over his face. A glob of grease popped off the hot stove and landed, sizzling, on his bottom lip. He licked it up and let out a faint moan. The pain was a moment of relief. Of distraction. No longer was he a 34-year old minimum-wage-slave sharing an apartment with his wife and his mother and her three cats: he was a man in pain. And he wanted more.

Steam rose and fell. Fries were tossed into the air, dancing in clouds of salt. Labored breathing and chatter and songs on the radio that were popular half a decade earlier. Uniform-clad primates aching for meaning serving as robots serving soft serve and food packed with taste and emptied of nutrition designed such that it would only scratch the itch of hunger of its consumers so that they would keep yearning for more, their physiological factory settings shaped by the process of evolution hi-jacked by insatiable corporations whose existence towered before them all. Mitochondria were independent organisms before they became battery factories for multicellular organisms and Jonathan's coworkers were human before they became cogs in a great machine that existed for no purpose but its own growth and maintenance.

"If I'm still working here when I'm 30 I think I'll just blow my brains out, you know?"

"Shh. Isn't Jonathan like 35?"

When he looked over at them, they seemed strangely offended. It was as if their offensive remarks were justified in their minds and that he, if he judged them by them, was the villain. He smiled.

"I have this new trick. For the fries. Let me show you," said Jonathan.

His twenty-something coworkers stepped aside. One of them rolled her eyes. "Okay?" she said.

Jonathan gazed into the bubbling oil and he bobbed his head inside.

It was a new sort of pain. Not sharp. Not dull. All-encompassing. He *became* the pain. For a brief moment, Jonathan Seaworth was agony incarnate. Vague, muffled screams reached him from somewhere. And that was when he met the devil.

The devil was a tap-dancing woman with a short skirt and a long neck. Her eyes seemed to pop out of her skull and she had tied her dark-brown hair in a bun. "Jonathan Seaworth," she said. "You are finally here. We will finally be partners."

"Who are you?" he asked.

"Why, I'm Satan!" she replied, tap-dancing back and forth.

For some reason, he thought of his wife. He thought of her eating what she called 'red toast', which was nothing but two slices of toast glued together with ketchup.

"I died already?"

She laughed. "Not yet. But you are dying. You are lying on the floor. Someone spilled a bowl of lettuce over you, and they're all screaming their heads off. There are customers at the register, angry that their orders aren't ready yet. Your manager has already called someone to pick up your shift. He called them before he called for an ambulance."

"That's messed up," Jonathan said. "Wait. You said we were partners. What did you mean?"

Satan pursed her lips and clacked her shoes. Tippety-tap. Tippety-tap. "Congratulations are in order," she said. "You have unlocked a special ability. With your defiant and, frankly, poetic ongoing demise you have 'tapped' into the great reservoir of G'rthu who has decided to bless you with an upgraded run. You should count yourself lucky. It's very rare that G'rthu takes an interest in human affairs."

For a moment, Jonathan thought that the devil sounded like someone from the corporate office. A woman had visited their restaurant once after they won a regional sales contest. She had the exact same tone of voice as Satan. Friendly, yet distant. Excited, yet subdued. "Who is ... Gurto?"

"G'rthu," Satan corrected him. "They are an entity beyond your powers of imagination, so there's no point in trying to explain it. What is important is that G'rthu has granted you a second lease on life, and I will join you in your future endeavors. Think of me as an invisible friend." She winked.

Before Jonathan had the time to respond, he suddenly found himself in bed in his own apartment. Below him was his wife, grunting. The smell of her rotting teeth frightened him, and he hopped out of bed. "Woah!" his wife cried. "What's going on? Is there a spider?" She hopped out as well and landed beside him.

"She would actually be quite attractive, if not for her teeth."

Jonathan screamed when he saw Satan tap-dancing in the corner of their bedroom. From his wife's look of confusion, he could tell that she wasn't seeing what he was seeing.

"Quiet down, you two!" shouted his mother. "You're waking the cats!" She banged on their shared wall.

"Let's fix that," said Satan, and she snapped her fingers.

A light filled the room with a brief flash, and when it was gone Jonathan saw his wife sitting next to him with perfect teeth. "Ow!" she cried. "My gums!"

"And let's fix that other thing as well," said Satan. Cats abruptly hissed and there were sounds of scratching and biting intermixed with his mother's screams. Then there was silence, but for the sound of chewing and purring.

Jonathan covered his mouth with his hands, shocked at what was happening. Satan tapped her way over to him and said, "I think this upgraded run of ours is going to be pretty interesting."
