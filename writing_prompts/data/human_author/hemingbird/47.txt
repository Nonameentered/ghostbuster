The kid tugged at my leather kimono, wide-eyed, and said, "Sir. I usually eat chicken nuggets now. My show will be on soon." He pointed at my state-of-the-art World Surveillance System, the screen dyed a delicately-evil red.

"Show? What show?" I scratched my thick, bushy beard. Was the kid talking about a showdown? Had his father, Red Salmon, tricked me?

I clapped in morse code, activating the WSS, and images of various heroes flashed across the screen in rough blips. *The kid probably thinks it's so cool*. They're stock photos, to be honest. But it looked impressive. Like I'd got them all in the corner of my eye. I looked down and the kid was ... suppressing a yawn!?

Red Salmon swam his way upstream in the hero market. I, Sharkbeard, have been chasing him for years. "Ah!"

Truth be told, the WSS exclusively receives live feeds from cameras I have placed around Red Salmon's house. And there, before me, he stood. Doing ... the dishes?

"H-He knows you're missing, right?"

"Oh, I called him earlier. Said I was hanging out with a friend."

What? No, no, no. Red Salmon was supposed to be in the throes of desperation now, flapping around like a fish on the docks. "Why would you do a stupid thing like that!?"

The kids let out another yawn. "I thought you were, like, a cool guy. You looked cool. But this place is pretty boring ..."

A scream forced its way up my throat, but I sent it back down into my lungs. "Boring? This is the lair of the greatest villain of all time. I have *gadgets*. Weapons. Costumes purchased in *Akihabara*."

The kid tugged at my kimono again. "Can we watch my show now? You can't seriously want to watch dad do his dishes. That's ... weird."

"It's not weird! It's *surveillance*."

"... You are not a creepy person, are you?"

For a moment, I didn't know what to say. Bats are creepy. And that's the reason why they are cool. But I'm not some pervert! I'm a supervillain, with powers rivaling the highest-paid heroes in the industry. I've trimmed my beard in the shape of a shark's fin--is that creepy? No! It's cool!

"I'm Sharkbeard," I said, expecting the kid to shit his pants.

"Yeah, you're friends with dad from work, right?"

"... What?"

"He's always talking about you, and he made me think you were a cool guy. But if you're just some creepy person who likes to watch people doing dishes ..."

"No. Your father is right. I'm a cool guy. The bane of his existence, in fact. His nemesis. His archvillain. His--"

"Buddy," the kid said, nodding his head.

The word ricocheted through my mind like a sentient harpoon, just tearing and flying again and again through my mind-flesh. "Buddy?" I said. "Are you sure ... that was the word he used?"

Suddenly, the kid seemed not so sure and I felt horror wrap itself around me like a maelstrom. "*Best* buddies!" the kid said, and he clapped. I almost fell over. Best buddies? BFFs?

I paced around my lair. Well, it was true that I had no respect for any hero other than Red Salmon. He wasn't the best-regarded hero in the city. High-Octane Man, Lord Pelvis, Firecat--TikTok was filled with snippets of them in action and people gushed about them all over social media all the while Red Salmon languored in relative obscurity. But I knew better than those fame-fondling flounders. I had *chosen* Red Salmon. And he had chosen me.

On the WSS, Red Salmon polished a novelty mug with the text World's Best Hero written on it. He smiled. I walked over to my high-end cabinets and opened them up to reveal the mug I had bought for myself as a spur-of-the-moment thing. World's Best Villain it read.

"We go a long way back," I said.

"Oh. Cool."

"Your father and I have fought for years, and through mutual combat and strife we have both grown."

"Yeah?"

"But before this very moment, I ... I didn't realize that in the process we had become ... *friends*. A bond has been forged, through fire and--Hey! Are you ... Are you watching a *cartoon*?"

My precious WSS, hard-coded only to respond to my careful morse claps, hacked by an imp? A green squirrel with crazy eyes ran about with some blue moose. The kid pumped his fists as the squirrel decapitated the---"W-What sort of kid's show is this? And how did you get it onto my screen?"

The kid held up his phone. "Universal remote control app," he said. "Oh, the show is called Happy Tree Friends."

"An app?" That was ... awkward. I never knew apps could do things like that. "And *Happy* Tree Frogs? They are maiming each other!"

"Friends." The kid scowled at me. "Happy Tree *Friends*."

Ah. I had not yet grown accustomed to that word.

The show turned out to be highly entertaining. We ordered chicken nuggets and watched many episodes, and the glee with which the kid met the macabre displays on the screen warmed my cold-blooded heart. "You're pretty cool," I told him.

He smiled. "You're pretty cool too! I can see why my dad likes you so much."

I blushed and tried to hide it by rubbing my beard. "Oh, is that so? T-That's neat, I guess."

After a while I gave the kid a ride home in my Beard-mobile. It's a 1997 Toyota Corolla. When I got back to my lair, I clapped my screen to attention and watched Red Salmon and his family play Yahtzee.

I made myself a cup of hot chocolate, in my World's Best Villain mug, and as I watched them all enjoy themselves a strange stinging sensation appeared in my heart. Had the kid poisoned me? Had it all been an evil--I mean *heroic*--plot?

Nothing happened. I flicked the WSS off with a somber clap and a great silence enveloped my lair. I downloaded the remote control app on my phone and watched some episodes of Happy Tree Friends.

The word bounced around in my head.

Friends. Buddies.

BFFs.

"Red Salmon," I said, "one of these days I'll get you ..." With that, I fell asleep in my chair. I dreamt about a show called Happy Ocean Friends, starring me and Red Salmon.
