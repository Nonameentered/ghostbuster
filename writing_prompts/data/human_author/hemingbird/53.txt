Steve Jenkins was the sort of man who knew the smell of his own vomit better than he knew the smell of his mother's perfume. He got his tank tops delivered directly from a factory in Malang, Indonesia because the cost added up when he tore it to shreds at a climactic moment every single evening.

On an unassuming Friday night in midtown Manhattan, Steve witnessed something that set his soul ablaze: an abandoned shopping cart. From what I have been told, the word 'bruh' was said at least sixteen times before he found himself racing down a steep hill while his companions watched on from the top.

"What could go wrong?" he said before he hopped in. And directly behind had stood a man. Steve did not see him. No living human has ever seen this man--the one they call Murphy. Yet his law reigns supreme in the mortal realm and etched in stone in some godforsaken place are the words, "If anything can go wrong, it will."

I have been told that Murphy had postponed his appointment with Steve Jenkins, for he saw something of himself in the eyes of that man. In his younger years, Murphy had been a daredevil challenging gods and men alike. It had cost him dearly. Cursed by Zeus himself, Murphy now spent his days as a living embodiment of his own hubris.

Steve Jenkins never heard the sound of the wheel popping off. At 70 miles per hour, the shopping cart suddenly halted and Steve flew from it, flung like lightning from the hands of the god of thunder.

There was a moment, I have been told, when Steve came to realize that he would not survive the imminent impact with the asphalt. And at that moment, he brought his fingers to his chest and he felt for the cheap fabric of his tank top. It was yellow. He made sure to keep the colors varied, because he believed there was some secret significance to them. A blue tank top symbolized peace, while a red tank top symbolized passion. He never knew what a yellow tank top represented. Yet he let out a heroic cry and he ripped it to shreds before cracking and splashing against the hard ground like a can of tomatoes in a grinder.

In a small factory in Malang a vase broke at that exact moment. The supervisor removed his glasses and let out a sigh of regret. "An ill omen," he said to the others, and so it was.

There were tears in the eyes of Murphy as he repeated his law to himself as if it were a mantra. "If anything can go wrong ... it will."

Up on the hill cheers rang out and they lasted for quite a while before any of them understood what had happened.

Steve's tank top, died red with his blood, danced in the wind. It was a dance of passion.
