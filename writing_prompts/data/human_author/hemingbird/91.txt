What's this? says Beelzebro and grabs my almost-finished bottle of Dutch schnapps. Can I drink it?

You certainly cannot, I tell him. I'm saving it for a rainy day. He pretends he can't hear. Instead, he pours himself a glass and he smacks his lips before chugging the whole thing.

Yu-uck, he says. It tastes like toothpaste. Where did you even get this stuff?

It's peppermint schnapps. My father brought it back from his trip to the Netherlands. My *late* father.

What a guy, says Beelzebro. Can't get home on time, can't pick out decent liquor. He flashes his tongue, which is now milky-white, and he says wheuh wheuh.

I mean he died, I say, but he has already moved on. Now he's inspecting my cabinet for more. As I let out a deep sigh I think to myself that at least I've learned a lesson: If you're dyslexic, don't try to summon Beelzebub. Because if you're not careful, you might instead find yourself visited by—

Oh, look at this stuff. It's blue. How's it work? You just spray it down your gullet? He gives it a go, and I have some fun watching while he falls into a fit, coughing.

That's Windex, I tell him.

It's because I sprayed it, he says, and before I have the time to correct him he's unscrewed the cap and he's pouring it down his, well, *gullet*.

Ice, ice, ice, he says and he throws me a blue grin. I feel cold all of a sudden. Mind if I crash on the sofa here for a bit?

Please leave, I say, and he takes off his pants. I repeat myself: *please leave*. It's no use. He's already wrapped in a blanket with his thumb in his mouth.

My father was headhunted by a rival company. That is, the coked-up son of the CEO of the second-biggest umbrella company in our area hunted down my father and removed his head. He was the top salesman of his company. According to himself, he could convince a fish it needed protection from the rain. He had just gotten back from pitching his company's latest product—a stylish bicycle-helmet umbrella—when Jacob Snotface (Snodgrass) showed up at our doorstep with an ax and all the grace of a sewer rat.

It took me days to work out a proper scheme for revenge, when I finally decided that eternal damnation would suit him just fine. But, alas, things didn't go according to plan. I sacrificed my only dwarf-goat heart and now I'm left with ...

Beelzebro passes gas and groans. What have you done to me? he says. I feel awful.

That's because you drank a whole bottle of Windex.

No, I liked that one, he says. I think it was the schnapps.

It wasn't the schnapps, I say.

No, I think it was. It's hurting like mad, bro.

As he twists and turns in agony, I start to wonder what Beelzebro normally does when he's summoned. So far he's only drunk stuff and complained. Is that his whole gimmick?

What do you do? I ask him.

It's called *how* do you do, he replies and he laughs but it seems to cause him great pain and he whimpers.

No. I mean, what's the point of you? Why would anyone want to waste a goat's heart on you?

Beelzebro holds up a trembling finger. A dwarf goat's heart, he says. I'm fun to be around. I make the party happen. I can help you score, if that's what you're thinking.

I've got an ax to grind with this guy, Jacob. Is that something you can ...?

He jumps up from the sofa, screams in pain, and claps his hands together. Of course, he says. I keep up with stuff. I know what Grindr is. You're gonna be balls deep in Jacob in no time, buddy. Or the other way around. Whatever floats your goat. Your *dwarf* goat. Abruptly, he falls onto the sofa again and wipes a lone tear. Sorry, he says. I just thought of a small goat floating off towards a waterfall, all helpless. Man. I think that schnapps stuff was loaded with oestrogen or something.

I explain to him what I meant and I tell him the story about the headhunting. He looks extremely uncomfortable. We head out, and it's raining. I open a blue umbrella. One of my father's. Beelzebro gets drenched, though he tries to walk under it.

Life as an umbrella is quite sad. When they're not completely closed off, they're under the weather.

We arrive at the Snotface mansion, and the family butler greets us with a subdued look of disgust. Master Jacob? I am afraid he is not taking visitors at the moment. I shall inform him that you tried to get in touch with him, Mr ....?

I glance up, and I sock him in his butlery teeth. I know. It's not nice taking your frustration out on the staff. But here's the deal: when Jacob arrived at our doorstep, this was the guy carrying his ax for him on a literal pillow.

Beelzebro howls with excitement, and he gives the butler another sock for good measure. Trying to block my bro from some hot action, huh? he says, and I wonder if he's forgotten why we're here.

We pass an armada of staff and manage to dodge them before finally reaching Jacob's bedroom, which might be better described as a chamber. If you haven't brought my fizzy soda, he says, I swear I will have your organs mailed to your relatives one by one.

Drop your pants, says Beelzebro and Jacob goes pale as peppermint schnapps.

We're here for his head, I remind my Windex-minded associate. He slaps his cheek and nods furiously.

You fools, cries Jacob. You will never get away with this.

Put your pants back on, I tell him.

No! he says. You can't tell me what to do.

You're being a bit of a brat, bro, says Beelzebro and chugs another bottle of Windex.

Where'd you get that? I ask him.

A girl in a maid outfit was carrying it around. This is a real party mansion.

That was a literal maid, I say, but he's not listening. Jacob watches with horror as Beelzebro empties the bottle and smacks it on the ground, howling. Wheuh wheuh he says. Ah! Ice, ice, ice. Sleepy. Sleeepy ...

Focus, I tell him. He assumes a fighting stance, and after a few seconds he drops to the floor with a thump.

You will pay for what you did to my father, I say.

Why? asks Jacob. I made him head of our company. Meaning, our company's got his head. He points up at the wall behind his bed and there's my father, stuffed and displayed like a hunting trophy. With a horrified look on his face.

And that's when I snap.

When I wake up, we're sitting under a bridge and my father's umbrella has gone red. Beelzebro sits in a fetal position, rocking back and forth.

What happened? I ask.

I'm sorry for drinking the toothpaste stuff, he says.

What *happened*?

I'll even go to Neverland and get you a new bottle.

Beelzebro!

W-Well, he says, you sort of went ... all mad. You slaughtered Jacob and his whole family and shielded yourself from their blood with your umbrella.

I look over at it and see it's dripping. Oh.

Yeah, says Beelzebro. They're all gone now. Oh, and a guy from your father's company picked us up in a van. Said they'd been keeping watch, and that they'd cheered you on. Said they made you Temporary Rain-Protection Officer. Said it was an umbrella term.

Oh, I say.

Uh, yeah. Beelzebro nods. Then he rubs the back of his neck. So, he says, I think I'm gonna skedaddle. To Neverland. Get you a bottle of that yucky, uh, that good stuff.

Sure, I say. You do that.

Beelzebro hurries off and I lie down in the grass under the bridge and I think to myself that this bridge is an umbrella to me right now. It protects me from the rain.

I look over to my left and I see my father's head.

He's smiling.
