"For the carpet, I'd say something red. Ruby, burgundy, maroon—"

"Blood?"

Winona Bellatova was a painter who no longer painted and a mother who had lost her children. Her very existence teetered on the brink of paradox as she had come to identify herself with all that she had lost, as if prematurely haunting herself as a ghost of her own unfinished business. She was also exceedingly tall and had a slight lisp when she spoke which, when paired with her surname, made fresh acquaintances assume her to be an immigrant of European descent though she had, in fact, grown up in Newport.

"Blood? Oh, no. I can't stand blood. No, nothing of the sort for me. Carmine, perhaps?"

Sipping on her merlot, her wedding ring clattering on the glass, Winona carefully studied the face of the interior designer she had hired on a whim. After watching Yasujirō Ozu's Noriko trilogy, alone, she had been struck by the minimalism of Japanese homes and became horrified by the realization that she, herself, was a maximalist. She surrounded herself with things and trophies and souvenirs and this was to her a startling discovery. When did it all begin? Had she always been like this? Did guests assume that she was filling each empty space--and every silence--because she had something to hide? Did her unconscious attitudes towards home decoration betray a deep psychological truth about her? She felt exposed as never before and when she called for an interior designer, she pursued the matter the way one might a cockroach infestation.

The man before her, who had introduced himself as Vince, bore one of those theatrical faces wild with elastic expressions which makes one feel at ease, thinking everything lurking within them springs instantly to the surface. His silvery hair stood in sharp contrast to his nigh ecstatic shirt screaming with yellow and blue, and it made Winona think it was a scream of lost youth.

"It will certainly help cover up stains," said Vince and from his coy look Winona felt sure that it was some kind of joke, and she felt eager to play along.

"Yes, I can murder you and no one will know," she said, and laughed softly before having another sip.

Vince furrowed his brows and scratched his left temple. "I was thinking about the wine," he said.

"I might have a glass of wine after I'm done murdering you," she said, and she instantly remembered all the times kids had stared at her at childhood playgrounds with faces of confused disgust. Why did she say that? Why did she have to say that? Was there some kind of demon inside of her that thrived on her misfortune?

"Ah," said Vince and his lips tightened. "These are some very nice paintings," he said.

"Thank you. They are all mine, except the one above the fireplace. That's my daughter's."

Vince laughed. "The style is certainly different. Is that a giraffe?"

"It's a cat," said Winona. She slanted her head. "I think."

"How old is she?"

Winona stared at Vince, not quite sure if he were being serious. "The cat?"

Again, he laughed. Winona smiled, somewhat uneasy, but relieved she hadn't completely put him off with her murderous jokes. "Your daughter," he said.

"Oh. She's eight. She's been eight for a good ten years now."

Vince's elastic face contorted into an expression Winona couldn't quite recognize. "God, you mean ...?"

"My husband took them to the Mardi Gras. He grew up in New Orleans, you see, and he wanted them to experience the excitement of the festival. Oh, we had a boy as well. Celine and Jacob. And he wanted me to experience it as well, but I was hard at work on a commission so I told them to make some memories for me as well. Then there was a DJ in an SUV with a suspended license for a DUI, abbreviations and inebriation, and that was the end of my life. I'm sorry. That's TMI."

Vince winced, as was appropriate. "I'm sorry," he said.

"Why?" said Winona. "Did you force a bottle of bourbon down the DJ's throat? If not, I'd say you're in the clear."

The interior designer was clearly stumped. Winona had another sip of wine and wondered if she should feel offended. Her grief wasn't a hideous open wound oozing with puss. It wasn't a disfigurement. It was her. If it made him uncomfortable, didn't that suggest that the essence of her person were something she ought to hide away? Or perhaps she should have been more considerate of the man's feelings. She had just assaulted him with her emotional baggage and now he stood dumbfounded before her; a victim.

"Perhaps you'd like a glass of wine?" she said.

"No. I'm quite alright," he said, and he seemed to choose his words the way a man might choose his path across a mine field.

"What about the kitchen?"

"I'm sorry?"

"It's lacking in the feng shui-department, I reckon. I'm sure you have some ideas."

Apparently thankful for the change in subject, Vince said, "Yes. Yes, in fact I was thinking about open shelving. Maybe a farmhouse vibe. Quartz countertops. A kitchen island in a loud color, perhaps."

"A loud color?" said Winona, intrigued. "Do you have synesthesia? Do you hear colors?" She suppressed the urge to ask him whether he could hear the screams of his own shirt.

"Uh, no. I just mean something that stands out. One of my clients recently went for a flashy turquoise kitchen island, and it really livened things up."

"My home is lifeless?" she asked. "Well, I suppose it's dead. Like my old husband and children."

"God, no. I wasn't implying—"

"Don't worry about it. It's not like they drowned yesterday."

His brows arched, and it appeared that he had a question but it also appeared that he wouldn't be asking it.

"Now, if we're talking about dead we should check out my bedroom."

Winona smiled. Vince didn't.
