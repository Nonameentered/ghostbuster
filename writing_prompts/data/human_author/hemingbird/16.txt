I waited.

I waited, and waited, and I waited.

The boulder stood still and firm.

"What are you waiting for?" I asked. "I'm on a schedule. Move along, will you?"

The boulder said nothing. It was a boulder.

All I could hear were the faint moans of the dead souls up in Hades. Tartarus, my place of imprisonment, is as far below Hades as Hades as heaven is below earth.

I sat down. Perhaps it was fatigued. The boulder, I mean. Rolling it up every day took its toll on me, but I never stopped to consider that it might also be tiring to roll down every night. Not exactly as tiresome, sure, but a fraction. My father, King Aeolus, used to say that walking down a hill was worse than walking upward. He had bad knees.

"Come on. Let's roll."

The words rolled so easily off my tongue, so why wouldn't the boulder do the same?

"It was just a metaphor, you knobhead!"

"Move along, miss. I don't make the rules."

Voices? People? I instinctively his behind the boulder. This had never happened before. Visitors? Why would I be having visitors? A chill passed swiftly through me like spoiled cabbage.

Peeking from behind the rock I for ages had taken for granite, I spotted Aecus, our janitor, as well as a strangely-dressed woman. She wore a silver vest over a red shirt. And ... pants. Pants! I nodded to myself. That was probably the reason why she had been sent here.

"This is outrageous," said the woman.

Aecus shrugged. "From what I've been told, you were the one to request this deal. Hey, Sisyphus! Are you there? He's usually here."

"That's the boulder?" asked the woman.

"Oh. Yes. That would be the one."

"It's smaller than I'd imagined."

Aecus laughed. "Any bigger and Sisyphus would never have been able to make it budge. But where is he? I hope he's not slacking off somewhere."

That ... jerk! "I'm here!" I cried. "I was not taking a break. I was inspecting something."

"Oh! Sisyphus! There you are!"

"I was inspecting something behind the boulder."

"Oh?"

"... Exactly." I folded my arms, scowling at him.

The woman cleared her throat. Her hair was long, dark, and curled. I had never before seen anything like it. In her presence I felt oddly small.

"Right!" said Aecus. "This is Kate. She'll be taking over from now on."

"No, I won't."

Aecus grumbled. "We've been over this. That's the deal. You'd do it without problems. That's what I've been told. You wanted to swap places."

"Not with this guy! It was just a metaphor. In a song. I wasn't saying that I literally wanted to swap places with anyone, and certainly not with Sisyphus!"

I felt insulted. "You'd never be able to do it. You don't have the stones."

She laughed. "Is that how you've been entertaining yourself? Making little rock puns?"

Clearly she had a heart of coal. "No. I'm actually working on a novel. In my head, I mean."

"A novel?" Aecus leaned in, curious.

I felt myself blush. "Well, yeah ... I have the first major arc worked out. It's the story of a Thessalian prince who ends up becoming the King of the Olympians because he's just so cool. And he bangs lots of broads and stuff ..."

When I said it out loud, I didn't sound as impressive as it had in my own head. Aecus and Kate stared at me, all pitiful.

"Ah ... Right. That sounds ... That sounds interesting! Well, you'll have plenty of time now. Your work is done. Like I said, Kate here will be taking over."

"Like hell I will!"

"Is that why the boulder stopped moving?" I asked Aecus. He raised his brows and studied the rock.

"It's not moving?"

"Well, you can tell, can't you?"

"Ah, yes. Now that you mention it, it doesn't look very lively."

"I'm thinking it might be fatigued."

"Oh, I see. Or perhaps depressed?"

"Ah. I hadn't thought of that. Maybe that's it."

Kate blinked. "Are you a pair of morons?"

A woman! Calling us morons! That was definitely the reason why she'd been sent to Tartarus. Speaking like that, to men!

"W-What?" said Aecus. "Us? Morons?"

"It's a boulder," she said. "It's not tired. It's not depressed. It's a goddamn *boulder*."

When she said it like that, it did seem to make sense. But then, why had it stopped rolling?

"Well," said Aecus, "I suppose if it's not rolling down, there's no need for anyone to be here on standby, ready to roll it back up." He grinned. "This woman, she thought she'd be able to run up this hill with it."

"Run?"

"Yeah. That's what she said. In the song where she made the deal."

"It was never that sort of deal!" the woman screamed. We both covered our ears. She had the wrath of Hera in her.

We stood in silence for a while. "Oh," said Aecus. "Come to think of it, what was it you were inspecting?"

"Huh?"

"You were inspecting something. When we came. Behind the boulder."

"Oh. Right. Yeah, I was, uh, I wasâ€”"

Kate rolled her eyes. "I think I know what he was doing."

"What do you mean?"

She frowned at me. "He was probably getting his rocks off."

Scandalous! "I was not!"

"Well, what were you doing then?"

Kate and Aecus looked at me, expectant.

"Well, you see ... Ah. Yes. I was trying to work out why the boulder wasn't moving."

"Oh!" said Aecus. "An industrious fellow." He smiled.

"Hmph," said Kate.

"I guess I'll just be taking you back then," said Aecus, looking at Kate. "With the boulder being all depressed or fatigued or whatever. Let's wait for the upper management to get things sorted."

"What about me?" I said.

Aecus stared me up and down. "I guess you can just remain here for the time being. Take some time. Work on your novel."

"Oh. Okay."

They left and Tartarus seemed darker all of a sudden in their absence.

I waited for the two of them to return.

I waited, and waited, and I waited.

The boulder stood still and firm.
