As Damien sat down to enjoy his orange juice cornflakes, he was struck by a stray thought: what if aliens were to invade today? He had been reading online that dark forces were gathering and that occult phenomena had gone up by 14% the last week alone. Strange things were seen hovering in the skies and local farmers were complaining about an assault of crop circle formations ruining their fields. According to a person online going by Blorgdong69, humanity was about to be visited by extraterrestrials, and they would not be coming in peace.

"How can you eat that?"

It was his sister, Carmelia. She wore a yellow dress she had sown herself and in her hand she held a hard-boiled egg.

"It's a normal breakfast. Only the order is different."

Damien took a sip of his cold glass of milk and let out a triumphant burp.

Scowling at him, Carmelia took a bite of her egg—shell and all—and said, "That's disgusting."

"How am I the weird one? You don't even peel your eggs."

She stomped the floor, hard. "I have good teeth!" she said.

As she stormed out, Damien said, softly, "Still, though ..."

He wouldn't mind it if Carmelia were to be kidnapped. They could do all sorts of experiments. He didn't care. They'd be doing him a favor.

"Rise and shine!"

With a great yawn and outstretched arms, Damien's father, Harold, entered the kitchen. Damien felt his shoulders grow tense. "You're eating that with OJ? You can't be cereal!" Harold slapped his knee and howled with laughter. When he opened the fridge, however, he became instantly quiet. "What? How can this be ... Damien! Where is my egg? I prepared one last night, but it's gone."

"Carmelia," said Damien.

Harold slumped to the floor. "My egg," he said. "My precious egg." Then he leapt back up with a fatherly groan. "I'll get the newspaper! That'll perk me right up!"

It wouldn't be so bad if the aliens kidnapped his father either, Damien mused.

Finally the last of the bunch, Damien's mother, stepped into the kitchen. Her hair was a mess. She had blue bags under her eyes and it looked like she struggled keeping them open. Saying nothing, she grabbed a jar of instant coffee and boiled some water. She added two spoons of coffee to a cup. Then she paused for a second, and poured freely into the cup from the jar itself.

"There's going to be an alien invasion," said Damien.

His mother turned to look at him, then said, "I know. Probably not today, though." She opened the kitchen window and stared out. "It's cloudy. They'd want clear skies, you know. So they would look all majestic. That's alien invasion 101."

Damien nodded thoughtfully.

"Speaking of aliens ..." said Damien's mother as Carmelia entered the kitchen.

"Mom. Does anyone in our family own a violin?"

"Not that I'm aware. Why?"

"According to my resume, I'm a classically-trained violinist. And a coworker got slurped up by our pants-folding machine at work, and now they want me to play something at the memorial."

"Why don't you just break one of your fingers?" Damien asked.

"How about this one?" said Carmelia, flashing him her middle finger.

"Carmelia!" Their father walked in, wagging his rolled-up newspaper at her. "Did you by any chance eat my egg?"

"She did," said Damien. "I told you."

"What sort of father gets upset at their child eating an egg?" said their mother. At this reprimand, their father's face went pale.

"I-I—It's not about the egg! It's about the lack of respect. It's about principles. You don't take other people's eggs."

"What's that in your hand?" asked Carmelia.

"Oh, this?" said Harold. "It's an egg. I found it outside."

Harold proudly displayed the egg. It was green and had a rough surface. Not a single animal on Earth would lay an egg like that. Damien and his mother looked at one another.

"That's an alien egg," said their mother. "The geometry indicates Alpha Centaurian origin, if I'm not mistaken." She scratched her chin, deep in thought.

Damien was amazed. His mother knew about alien geometry? He had been reading Blorgdong69's post on the subject, but most of it went way over his head.

"Nonsense!" said Harold. "This is a quail egg. And I bet it's going to taste just—huh, where did it go?"

Carmelia burped and covered her mouth as green slime dripped from its sides.

"Carmelia!" said Harold. "Not again!"

As she staggered backwards, yellow tentacles shot out from her back. Their ends had pointy teeth and let out shrill cries.

"On second thought," said Harold, "it's just an egg. Don't worry about it." He gulped.

Their mother raced to the window and let out a curse. "The skies," she said. "They have cleared."

It looked like there would be an alien invasion after all.
