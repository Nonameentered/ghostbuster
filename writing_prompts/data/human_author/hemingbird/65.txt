To be a fly on the wall ...

What am I saying? I *am* a fly on the wall. The wall of my own apartment.

My vision is monochromatic and kaleidoscopic and I see unpaid bills and sticky magazines and cigarette butts in a thousand visual modules all repeated over and over--a funhouse mirror reimagining of my pitiful existence. *Deeply troubling*. Have other flies on these walls watched me and pitied me? Have they found my day-to-day comings and goings deeply troubling?

Ick! There's some goop on my leg. Ah, how nice it feels to rub it clean. Rubbing them together, what an orgasmic thrill.

Wait. I am not supposed to be a fly on the wall. The mission is over.

The mission.

I was hired to spy on a dirty cop. "He fabricates evidence," said my client. "Find out what he's up to and get back to us."

Naturally I picked the form of the fly. Flies can get anywhere. But it's dangerous! It's as dangerous as being a streamer. Why? Because you might get swatted.

Ha ha.

Ha ha ha.

No, this is no time to be making jokes. What happened? Oh, yes ...

Officer Brad Jensen ate an impressive number of cheese sticks while watching cable wrestling. Then he got a call. His partner in crime, presumably, calling to check in. And Jensen said he had the undies in the trunk of his car.

Yes, the undies! The "smoking gun", he called them. If a drop of blood were to be found on them? Immediate conviction. No question about it. Any jury would go nuts and they'd probably even ask for the chair.

It was interesting being a fly on the wall watching the officer scratch his nether regions while conspiring against some poor guy arrested under the suspicion of brutally murdering his whole family.

I buzzed with excitement all the way home, and here I am. But where is me?

When I enter the minds of various organisms, I always leave my body at rest on a futon. That way, I know where to find it. But now! Now my body is gone.

"Did you make it back yet? Huh? Are you here, or what?"

That voice! It's my ... client.

"I've been talking into the air so many times now. I think I'll just leave a tape recorder. Wait, no. That wouldn't be the brightest of ideas. Tell you what, I'll just say this: we got your pretty little body and if you want it back you'll have to come work for us."

I buzzed about in a frenzy.

"Did you turn into a cat or something? I can't see a cat. Wait, don't tell me ... Are you that fly over there?"

... Bzz.

"Wow! You can turn into something like that? You'll turn mighty useful! Fly around in a circle."

My client reached for a magazine and folded it up. That wasn't a good sign.

"Hey, why's it all sticky ...?"

From a safe distance, I flapped my wings and made some hurried pirouettes.

"Oh, okay. I guess you really did turn into an insect. It's like that guy from the book, right? Samson?"

Samsa. Gregor Samsa. And he turned into a huge cockroach, not a fly. What sort of idiot is this client?

"Well, if you don't want to end up like Samson you best follow me."

Was he threatening me with a haircut? Ugh. He wouldn't get my reference even if I could speak. It's infuriating.

I followed him out the door, down the hallway, outside, across the park, down an alley, and ... Wait. I recognize this neighborhood. My parents live nearby. Was that how he had discovered the the truth about my services? Had my mother been gossiping? I let out a microscopic sigh. It had been a while since I'd been in contact with them.

When he made a turn straight towards their house, I panicked. Had he taken them as hostages as well? Wasn't my body enough? Oh no. How could I have let them get dragged into all of this?

"You still here, Sammie?"

Begrudgingly, I flew in circles over his head.

"That's good. We're nearly there."

My client opened the gate and headed straight for their house. As soon as he opened the door, I buzzed past him hoping that there was something I could do to help them. Anything. Perhaps I could bump myself into a phone, calling 911. It would probably kill me, but so what?

And that's when it happened. I saw myself. Seated in a floral-patterned chair, looking pretty comfortable. My parents, along with various friends and relatives, popped out from behind furniture and cried, "Surprise!"

I was in shock. What had just happened? I turned to look at my client, and he was laughing hard.

"Got you fooled, huh?"

Still disturbed, I was finally able to transform into myself again. My mother raced over and gave me a hug. "Did we surprise you? Oh, we haven't seen you for such a long time, dear!"

My father looked grumpy. He rolled up a newspaper and bashed the fly I had just lived through, and it exploded into a dark smear. "Damn flies," he said.

"Honey," said my mother reproachfully. "That's insensitive."

"It is?"

"Of course." She looked over at me. "Isn't it?"

I rubbed the back of my neck. "I suppose."

Then they all burst out in laughter.

"What about the case?" I said, looking at my client. "The dirty cop? I heard him talking about undies and blood and--"

And there he was. The dirty cop. Laughing along with the rest of them. "You should've seen your face, kid."

"He's Susan's brother-in-law," said my mother. "He helped us plan it all."

"Gary is my husband," he said, and pointed to my client. They kissed, and Gary playfully slapped my shoulder with my own magazine.

Right then I wished I could have seen my face. The cat was out of the bag, and I was surrounded by friendly faces for the first time in a long while.
