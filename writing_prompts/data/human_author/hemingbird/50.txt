"Boke? Get that shit out of my face. I'm a Schwepsi man."

Santa Claus sat bulging like a waterbed and he bit his dirty fingernails incessantly. Conrad flashed me a look and I knew just what he meant: this was going to be a problem. Santa Claus would not make a very appealing witness, no matter how much information he harbored.

"I would've thought, from the ads, that you were--"

Santa Claus rolled his eyes. "The elves started a union, dumbfuck. I needed some quick dough. Boke tastes like fermented elf piss. Even in the ads I drank Schwepsi in a Boke bottle--the ad people didn't give a shit. They just want the proletariat to guzzle down black corn syrup and that's it. Boca Bola, the company, they hired assassins to kill union leaders in third-world countries, you know? That's messed up. Me, I whored myself out for money so I could raise wages. I'm a saint."

The saint let out a gust of air. Conrad winced.

"You said you had information about the murder," I said.

"Oh," Santa said, looking up. "The *suicide*, you mean."

"Suicide?" said Conrad. "There's surveillance footage of the murderer escaping. Footprints. Neighbors saw it all happen."

Santa Claus let out a chuckle. "Get me a Schwepsi, dipshits." He scratched his unkempt beard. "I'll explain, but my throat's a bit dry at the moment."

"Fine," I said. I stood up and walked up to the vending machine in the hallway. I bought one bottle of Boke and one of Schwepsi. Then I poured the Schwepsi down the drain and filled it with Boke.

"Here you go," I said as I sat down. Santa Claus grabbed the bottle and took a long swig.

"Ah," he said. "That's the stuff right there."

"Interesting," I said.

"What?"

"I thought you knew everything. Like some omniscient god. Turns out, you're a fraud."

Santa Claus clanked the bottle down hard on the table. "The hell are you on about?"

"Guess you like the taste of fermented elf piss, huh?"

Santa Claus looked about ready to explode. He stood up. He was taller than I expected and when he reached for the bottle, I suddenly regretted my little prank. He stared at it for a long time. It was empty, sans for a few dark drops at the bottom. I grabbed Conrad by the shoulder, afraid of what would happen next.

"Guess I do, huh?" Santa Claus erupted into a fit of laughter. "Ho-ho-ho! It's really Boke? Oh, man. You got me there, huh?"

He sat down, all merry, and held his large belly as if it might burst open at any moment. "I'll tell you everything I know, but it might come as a surprise to you."

"... We're listening," said Conrad.

"Alright, so how can I get around the world in one night? Portals. Pretty simple. I open portals in chimneys and closets and various places and I can even travel back and forth in time. It's great. Don't tell anybody, though. I use the portals to spy on people as well, to find out if they're naughty or nice. One time though, I made a pretty embarrassing mistake. I left a portal open unattended. Whoopsie."

Conrad blinked severely. "Portals? You expect us to believe--"

"And this guy, the victim in fact, he found my portal. And it's was a portal to the future. He stepped through, and he was in his own house but a year later. And this guy, he was kind of a sad sack. Always thought about ending things, but didn't have the guts. Then he saw himself just lying there and he figured, that should do the trick."

"Wait," I said. "You're saying he ..."

"Killed himself," Santa said, shrugging. "After he did it, he went back through the portal and suddenly he felt like a changed man. He'd finally done it. Only, there would be a year-long delay. It's pretty messed up, isn't it?"

"And you're willing to demonstrate the existence of said portals in court?"

Santa guffawed. "Not a chance. You asked me what happened, and I told you. But you know what? The guy ended up regretting his decision. He finally felt free. And he discovered that he actually wanted to live. Then his past self came along and killed him. Was it a suicide, or was it a murder? Hard to say, right?"

"I don't buy it," I said. "Portals? That's nonsense. You're just a figurehead. Parents are the ones who buy the presents. You just take the credit."

Santa smiled, and I should have registered how sinister it was. "I'm not going to reveal my tricks to the public, but I can do it so you guys know I'm not making this up. Here, if you step through this portal you can find out how the trial went."

A vertical dark pool appeared and it glittered strangely. "W-What?" said Conrad.

"Just step right through," said Santa. "It's perfectly safe."

"Alright," I said. "I'll call your bluff. This is an impressive illusion, but it's no magical portal."

And I stepped through, expecting it to dissolve into smoke. But it didn't. It transported me somewhere else entirely.

The air was thick with a horrible smell of sweat and blood. I heard pained cries and for a moment I was convinced Santa Claus had sent me straight to hell.

"Hey! We have a newcomer. A new elf has arrived!"

A chained man, scarred and bruised, flashed me a toothless grin. I was inside an enormous factory, filled with skeletal people with hollowed-out eyes. "What's going on?" I said.

The man smiled and it was the saddest smile I'd ever seen. "We're Santa's elves," he said. "We all did something to upset him. This is our punishment."

A cloud of piss reached me from a grandfatherly figure relieving himself against a cement wall. The Boke? This was all due to me replacing his Schwepsi with a Boke?

The portal had disappeared. I was trapped, in Santa's factory.

I let out a cry of desperation and the voices of fellow tortured souls joined in; a chorus of elves. *I'm a saint*, he'd said. A man close to me banged his head against the wall, blood spurting everywhere. *I'm a saint*.

The chained man handed me wrapping paper and ribbons. "Best get to work," he said. There were tears in his eyes.
