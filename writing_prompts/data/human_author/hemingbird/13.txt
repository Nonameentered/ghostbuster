#Part 2

"This is green."

"Y-Yes."

"I thought you said it was a piña colada?"

The Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young carefully held the wine glass in one of his claws. He turned his eye towards Caroline.

"My name is Patrick, by the way."

"Patrick?"

"Yeah. You can call me Pat."

"Pat."

"Yeah, like that."

Paul cleared his throat. "It makes you think."

Pat blinked his lone eye. "What, my name?"

"N-No. The cocktail. It's not exactly ... what you'd expect it to be."

The goat-lobster creature on their sofa said, "Oh. I guess that's true."

It was like they were all sitting in molasses. Nobody dared move more than necessary, not even Pat. Perhaps they were all worried the tension in the room would spontaneously combust. It felt like it might.

"This is nice," said Pat. "And it's a nice apartment. You'll make great parents."

"Oh, I don't know ..." said Paul. "We're thinking about trying hypnotherapy. Or acupuncture."

Pat scoffed. "If you ask me, that stuff is just a scam. It's supposed to relieve stress, right? But stress isn't always the issue. Sometimes you're just unlucky. Or cursed."

"Cursed?"

Pat took a sip of his drink. "Yeah. It happens. People walk around and they don't know. They don't even know they're cursed. But I can tell. That's one of my abilities."

"What about us?" said Caroline. "Are we cursed? Is that why we're infertile?"

"Come on," said Paul. "We're not cursed. They said so at the clinic. I have a low sperm count and the few that I've got aren't great swimmers. That's only natural. I'm not much of a swimmer myself. And you have POS syndrome."

"PCO syndrome," Caroline corrected him.

"Right. It's not a curse. It's genetics. Or epigenetics. Or both. What's the difference?" Paul leaned back and folded his arms. "Well, it's just science, isn't it?"

"He's right," said Pat. "It's not a curse. I did pass by your landlord earlier, however, and he's cursed. Good old Groth-Golka is coming for him." He looked at them, clearly excited. "The Demon Bird-God of Balsagoð."

Their landlord, Henry, was in his fifties and he often wore sweater vests. How did he get himself cursed by a demonic bird?

"Anyhow," said Pat, "here's the egg."

"The egg?"

Pat unhinged his jaws and an egg-shaped object moved up his throat in apparent peristalsis. It sounded like he was in immense pain. Tears fell from his singular eye. He pushed through his agony and spat the egg at Paul who managed to catch it even with all the slippery slobber.

"W-What's this?"

Pat wiped his face with a napkin. "That's your child. Take good care of it."

With that, the Goat of the Woods with a Thousand (999?) Young left them behind.
