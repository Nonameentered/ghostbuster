Nietzsche, the horse-fondling madman, came up to me with rage in his eyes and holes in his pants and he said, "Please, please, please. You have to find God. They'll do horrible things to me. I was supposed to look after him, just for a couple of days. He wandered off."

Tears streaming down his facial jungle, Nietzsche tugged at his cheeks, pulling them like gum, and in so doing he also tugged at my heartstrings. "Nietzsche. I'll help you, pal. But I've got to ask: didn't you say God was dead?"

Down to his knees he sank. "So I did. Then I appeared before him, years later, and smugly God said, "Nietzsche is dead" and that was that and I had been bested--become the darn *untermensch*."

Nietzsche could read the confusion sprawled across my face. He cleared his throat. "I heard about the Nazis. They didn't show up, but people talked. I'm not responsible if they used my terminology. That was my sister--she corrupted my work. Elisabeth. But enough about that." He clapped his hands. "We need to find God. You have to help me; I've searched everywhere."

There were more tears and between sobs Nietzsche asked me if I had some banana liquor and I told him I didn't and he started blabbering in German so I gave him a good slap. "Where did you last see him? What were you doing wandering around with God in the first place?"

Nietzsche told me God had been doing some experiments with free will. Increasing it, decreasing it; just checking to see what would happen. And they'd chosen my town at random. They figured they'd make a weekend of it. Take a gander. And somehow they'd gotten separated and for some reason some higher deities had made Nietzsche personally responsible for his well-being and now the dead philosopher was in for it, celestially, and he went knocking on the first door he saw.

"Maybe he's in one of those bushes?"

"No. God doesn't like bushes. Too many bugs. They were his early work. He gets embarrassed looking at them."

"Okay. What about that free will business? Did he give it to someone in particular? Or take it from them?"

Nietzsche snapped his fingers and went, "Ja, ja!" then grabbed me by the collar and off we went.

It was a run-down strip mall on the outskirts of town and I'd already walked past the guy in the oversized coat when Nietzsche cried out, "God! There you are! Don't wander off like that!"

"My dear Friedrich. I see you have made a friend. Well, technically *I* made your friend. Heh." God poked Nietzsche in the ribs and he didn't seem to like it. "Shh. Check it out. I gave the man before us unlimited free will. Watch how he spends it."

It was a man walking in a circle, his face buried in his hands. "If I do that, then ... No! I can do this and then ... No! No, that won't do ..."

God smirked. "He's been like that for an hour." God puffed out his chest and stretched out his arms. "Guess free will isn't all that grand, is it?"

Nietzsche scoffed. "Well, this guy is no better."

They both stared at me. Nietzsche and God. "What?" I said. "Why are you guys staring at me?"

"Is that really him?" God said.

"You already know it's him," said Nietzsche. "Look at him. A complete lack of free will, and you can hardly notice it."

God waved his hand in front of me. "Wakey, wakey."

"Stop that," I said.

For a moment, God paused. Then he said, "Wait, let me check my notes. This guy's really it? That can't be right ... Oh, here! Let's see ... Robert S. Henderson ... Aha! Wait. No. That's ..."

"What?" Nietzsche tried to sneak a peek at God's notes, but I couldn't see anything. God seemed to be just holding out his palms.

They both looked up at me.

"What?" I said.

"That's a, uh, statistical anomaly," said God.

"What?"

"Never seen a thing like that before," said Nietzsche.

"Come on. Spill the beans."

"Well, the thing is ... " God scratched his rich beard. "We gave the guy wandering in circles unlimited free will, and we removed your free will entirely. But according to these notes ... You didn't have any free will to begin with."

An aspen leaf flew by.

"What?"

"A philosophical zombie?" said Nietzsche.

"I know you are, but what am I?" said God and they both cackled with laughter and it wasn't even funny because the joke had been directed at me, not God.

"I'm going to go," I said.

Nietzsche arched his eyebrows while staring at the ground. "Won't be your decision ..."

I took a step forward. "If I want to go, I'll go."

"Imagine if this guy was named Gunther," said Nietzsche.

"Go on," said God, clearly excited.

"He'd be a real Gunther-mensch."

They laughed like mean girls and God slapped his knee and it was weirdly awe-inspiring but also infuriating. "I can do what I want!"

"Settle down, Gunther," said God and Nietzsche wheezed.

When I got home I made a bowl of soup and I stared at the soup for a long time before drinking it, trying to make sure it was my own choice and all, but it didn't seem to matter because in the end I drank the soup and if I didn't have any choice in the matter what was the point in worrying about it?

... 'Gunther-mensch'. It wasn't even clever.
