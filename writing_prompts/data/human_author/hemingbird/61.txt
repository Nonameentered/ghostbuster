"Rufus the Elder wishes to speak to you," said the medium. She pulled down her hood and looked at me strangely. "Rufusâ€”that's an unusual name. Any relation you can think of?"

I took a sip of my gooseberry tea. "It's a dog," I told her.

She blinked. For a moment she stared at my walls and furniture as if trying to ascertain she was still awake. "A dog," she repeated.

"Yup."

"That's ... new."

I got the house for cheap. For a nod, actually. By that I mean that my aunt left it for me in her will and all I had to do was to accept. Which I did. And I never stopped to consider why she left it to me; the girl she'd once referred to as, "the homely one." At my 14th birthday party. In front of Steve Beckenbauer and my admittedly more attractive sisters. I think that was also the year she gave me an ashtray because she "had a feeling" I'd soon find use for it. I never did, but it was a close one because I asked my mother if I could have a sprinkle of my aunt's ashes and she asked me what for and I told her what for and ever since she's been trying to get a hold of my therapist.

When I first moved in I could tell something was off because the walls kept barking and I don't know much about houses but I know walls aren't supposed to be barking. There was also that incident where I stubbed my toe and I cried and I told myself, aloud, "walk it off, walk it off," and the entire house erupted into chaos. The chandelier trembled with excitement and the latches of the front door flew open and all around me I could hear wet and delirious and downright exuberant panting.

I cleared my throat. "Good boy, good boy; what say you?"

"R-Right," said my medium. "It's a dog." She seemed to be saying it to herself. After some hesitation she pulled her hood back up (I'm assuming that's how she entered Medium Mode) and she began saying, "Right. Right. The ... swivelly donut? In the backyard. Oh. A swing. You want something buried under the swing in the backyard." She turned to look at me, visibly uncomfortable.

I took another sip of my tea. "An ancient artifact of some sort, I suppose." The medium didn't seem to know what to make of my deduction.

"I think I'm going to ... leave," she said and I couldn't blame her. She'd lasted longer than most of the psychics I'd hired. Granted, this was the first time there hadn't been any ghostly leg-humping.

My spade clinked against something almost right away and I was disappointed because I'd pictured a great, big hole and this wasn't even a hole it was just some dirt tossed aside on the lawn.

On closer inspection it was a tin box and something rattled inside when I shook it. The lid popped off easily and when I took a look inside I grinned like an arsonist in a matchstick factory.

As I re-entered the house I could sense that the mood had shifted. Ethereal tails wagged all around and I thought the dogs had to be salivating hard because I could see spots of ectoplasm all around. Then I realized it was the mold. Well, the excitement was real at least.

"I have retrieved the ancient artifact, Sir Rufus. Behold!"

I opened the tin box to reveal a badly-mangled chew toy in the non-shape of a cat. For a few moments, nothing happened. Then something happened: I felt the warm and furry embrace of a dog once and now named Rufus. The walls wailed softly with happiness and I joined in because how could you not and just like that Rufus the Elder crossed over to the other side accompanied by the celebratory howls of his brethren and sistren and I'm not above to admit that I joined in on that as well.

He was the fourth one I'd assisted so far, and there were plenty more to go. I would help them all. Lost and stranded puppies and mutts and canines and Rovers and Fidos and friends and spooky fuzzballs of bliss; I would help them all get to the other side. But there was no reason to rush it.

"Who wants to go for a walk?" I said and the floorboards thundered with yaps and yelps. High up on a shelf the ashtray clattered and clattered and then it fell and broke into a thousand pieces.
