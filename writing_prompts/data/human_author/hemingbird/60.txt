"A little dose of oxytocin huh bud?" my uncle said before shedding his skin and flexing his very visible muscles.

Gaunty, old ladies ran past like a string of ducklings and I heard the sirens blasting all around before taking my government-issued emergency shot of testosterone. My uncle got down on all four and cursed the sun for shining down upon his sensitive hypodermis. An ambulance crinkled around a corner and as they swept my uncle up on a stretcher one of them turned toward me and said, "Ma'm you better step inside 'cause love's in the air tonight."

Just why an extradimensional being had manifested and blessed Phil Collins with powers beyond belief puzzled most of us, when we found time for puzzling, and streaming his music had recently become a capital offense given it shuddered listeners with waves and throes of excitement that made them grow new limbs most of which sprung from the rectal region. Even the word for the creation of all things had been banned as the mere association propagating electrically in your cerebrum was enough to melt your flesh clean off your bones.

We were all at the mercy of Phil Collins. That is, before Michael Slops entered the scene.

Slops had been born with a very rare disease that made him synthesize testosterone from calcium and some researchers believed it to now comprise 16.3 percent of his body mass. The natural predator of oxytocin, Slops' testosterone made him virtually immune to the depraved beast known as Phil Collins.

As I hurried home I heard the infamous wet steps of the legend himself and a moment later I saw, silhouetted against the sun, Slops taking on the astral blob of metaphysical matter Phil Collins as of late had become. It gushed and rained but what gushed and what rained I did not know. All I knew was that our man was up there, fighting our tormentor.

People rallied instantly, emerging from their shelters to see the oxytonergic air drawn into the lungs of Slops and we cried as he heroically slobbered it all up. Wet slaps of gratitude abounded. Phil Collins howled as a caged extraterrestrial and to our shared horror we saw he was carrying a drumstick.

"It's a trap!"

"Get down Mr Slops! Get down!"

But it was too late. Phil Collins drummed the belly of our savior and it burst into a sea of purple and pink, raining down on all of us, along with all the oxytocin Slops moments before had contained in his bodily cage.

Cries rang out from a want of skin for the skin ran down the gutters freely and there we stood; exposed wires of subcutaneous tissue, and broken choked wails penetrated tympanic membranes that, too, were melting away.

Phil Collins softly hummed and us wretched souls; milk without our corporeal cartons, cursed the thing of demon he had become. Then we heard the crack.

His face was a land of confusion as he gazed upon his broken instrument. Phil Collins looked up, toward the home planet of Strjekk Sjokkar the alien god of transformation, and he whelped.

Before him hovered Michael Slops, and in the hero's mouth were bones. A street sweeper had offered up his calcium for the cause and Michael Slops had now become a being of 100% testosterone.

Crackling thunder filled the air and a sweet rain fell down and it seemed to wash away our pain. The air sizzled and we saw that our skin was growing back--returning from whence it had come, oozing from the gutters to reassemble us and reskinned we basked proud as Michael Slops pulverized the astral form of Phil Collins. A cloud of gas was all that was left behind and it too dissipated and humanity was saved from oxytocinergic terror and free again to breathe in loveless air.

"How can we repay you?"

"You have saved us all!"

"I got here a bit late. What's going on?"

The people rejoiced and they got down on their knees, blessing their skin for the comfort it provided, and we all looked up to the brilliant mess of testosterone soaring above. "I have transcended," said Slops. "I have now become an alien god, from the perspective of beings from other worlds, and I will watch over you and let sweet gobs of testosterone rain down on you and I hope it will serve you well."

My uncle hopped out from behind a corner, skin intact, and he gave me a hug. "A little dose of oxytocin huh bud?" he said and so the eternal cycle of our time loop reset anew.
