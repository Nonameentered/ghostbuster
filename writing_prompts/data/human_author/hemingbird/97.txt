A streak of light flashes across the night sky and as I adjust my glasses I arrive at a dispiriting conclusion: tonight will be the end of the world.

Vanity the Sovereign reached out to me alone. "Two months ago, you knocked a taco out of my hands. I was really looking forward to eating it. Then you came along. Drunk. Mischievous. You thought it would be funny to knock a perfectly good taco out from the hands of a stranger, and now you will pay the ultimate prize. Your home planet is doomed. I will annihilate it. Just like you annihilated my taco."

It was the night when all the cosplayers come to town. They have a little convention, and they arrive in hordes. Sweaty. Excited. A bit pervy, often. I don't like them. I don't like them at all. So when I saw the fellow dressed up like a video game character, I took it out on him. He didn't deserve it, of course. It was a stupid and mean thing to do. But he looked so happy, like a puppy with a shiny new ball. So I couldn't resist. I swung my arm out as me and my friends passed him, and I saw him desperately try to save it before it crashed to the pavement, spilling its innards of condiments and lettuce and beef all over and the sight, I admit, made me howl with laughter. When he cried out in anger, I said, "Hey. Use your words. Let's *taco* 'bout it." This comment took the air out of him, it seemed, and we left him standing deflated and defeated and I didn't think more of it until he arrived at my doorstep.

Sure, it was a surprise to see that he was still wearing the costume. The convention was over. Our sewage system was still recovering, and most of the litter had been picked up from the streets. But there he was, in shiny, dark armor, and what I believed to be high-end prosthetics. He introduced himself as Vanity the Sovereign, and he claimed to be a god forgotten thousands of years ago. He returned to Earth every now and then to check how things were moving along, and that was what he was doing, he told me, when I ran into him.

I am seeing the fabric of space tear itself apart in front of me, and I am wondering: what sort of taco is so good you'd be willing to destroy an entire world for it? Do I have time to run around and sample our local taquerias?

I breathe a deep sigh. The world would have ended at some point even without my shenanigans. Like tacos, all things eventually fall apart.
