There was nothing I could do about my wife's disappearance but I could make this little piggy happy and that would have to do.

The dirt had dried in the sun, I noticed, so I hopped back into myself and searched for a vendor of some sort who might have a nice wet drink. I chanced upon a stall in eyesight of the pig's domain, and I wandered over in a hurry and ordered myself some overpriced ginger ale.

When I returned I brought the pamphlet back up to my eyes and peeked through the holes of the illustrated pig therein but not before giving the mud a good drizzle.

The transformation was instant--an oink through a wormhole--and I was once again transported into the mind of the swine.

As a pig I rolled and I rolled in that good mud, wet and comfortable and frothy. There was a decent scent to it as well. What happiness to a pig! Ginger ale mud; pearls of fizzy delight. Had anyone ever thought of a thing like that before? Hardly! It was an original invention and I dreamed a member of the petting-zoo staff would commend me for my brilliance.

Ah, what next? As a pig my appetite soared to heights like those of a balloon lost by a careless child--I was hungry! They didn't feed me properly! They gave me a sopping mess and of course I ate it for I was hungry, but that didn't mean I liked it! It only meant I'd rather eat it than starve though I'd much rather have fresh apples and figs and salmon--and who could resist salted peanuts?

Bouncing back into myself I set about it and raced to the cornerstore for apples and figs and salmon and salted peanuts because I'd climbed inside the mind of a pig and I knew what the pig longed for.

It took a while and when I found myself back I saw an old lady peeping through her pamphlet and then I saw the pig just sitting there in the mud, confused, and I thought that wasn't right at all. What does an old woman know about pleasing a pig? No! She wouldn't know. Sitting there like an oaf ... "Get lost!" I sneered and she let out a frightened eek and I helped on her way from the premises.

The pig huffed with delight as I stuffed its trough. "Eat up, piggy," I said and the animal did as I said. I brought the pamphlet back up to my eyes, because I wanted to enjoy the taste of my wares myself.

Apples! What zest! What aroma!

Figs--the formidable Ficus carica--dried and chewy and sweet.

Salmon? It occurred to me I didn't actually want salmon.

P-P-Peanuts! Firm and salted and exactly right--exactly the thing to sate the appetite of a pig.

"Honey?"

"Ah, yes I should have gotten honey."

"What ... are you doing?"

I turned to see Madge. The sight of her trampled me. "I was just looking at this pig over here ..."

"You were making sounds. Were you ... oinking?"

"No. I was clearing my nose. I think I'm allergic to pigs, actually. I think that's it. Hey, I thought I lost you there for a second."

"Lost me? I was just over by the ducks with Sandra from the Historical Society. You left us not ten minutes ago."

"Hey! Who fed the pigs? You aren't allowed to feed the animals. There are signs *everywhere*." A petting-zoo employee scanned the area with his sharp-drawn eyes, and I hurriedly crumbled my grocery bag into my pocket.

"My God," said Madge. "Some threw an entire salmon in there. What's wrong with people?"

"It's a crazy world," I said.

"Hey. Your pamphlet, dear. There's holes in it."

I gulped. "Is there? I didn't notice."

Madge grabbed my arm, and I winced because it hurt a little. "We don't want to be late, do we? My parents appreciate punctuality, as you well know."

As my wife dragged me from the premises, I cast a wistful glance back at the pig. Without Madge noticing, I brought the pamphlet back up to my eyes and for a stealthy second I entered back into the mind of the pig to make sure that I had made him happy.

To my relief, I found that I had. I had made that little piggy very happy.
