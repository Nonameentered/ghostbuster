"Is this Waffle House?"

"... *No*. This is our father's funeral."

My face fell like a lump of clay dropped onto something hard. A funeral? That couldn't be right. I was headed for the local Waffle House to steal high-value items and then cash. How did I wind up here? What happened?

"Finn, what's going on? Are you *stoned*?" Chrissy gave me a rough look. The kind of look a frog would give a toad if it had been acting all rude. "Jesus. You look like shit."

"I'm not high. I'm just confused. Where's the health inspector?"

"Health inspector?" Chrissy pursed her lips and in her needled eyes I could see pain, the type you get when you're real upset. "You're stoned out of your mind. Sit down."

This wasn't the misunderstanding I was expecting. I was looking for ... high-value items. And then cash. The workers ... They were supposed to confuse me for the health inspector.

Weren't they?

"We are gathered here today in remembrance of William Bucksgrin Shanneth—"

I leaned in and whispered in my sister's ear, "Something's not right."

Chrissy hissed. "You're damn right about that, at least. Our father exploded inside a Walgreens, Finn. *That's what's not right*."

Walgreens? No ... Wasn't it a Waffle House?

"God damn it!"

They all went quiet, all clad in black except the priest. I looked down. I was wearing a shirt featuring a talking meatball. Not from a movie or anything. It was just a shirt I bought on vacation because I needed something to wear and I hadn't brought enough.

I hadn't brought *enough*.

"Nobody ever expects blowing up inside of a pharmacy, least of all Walgreens. But these things happen. Not often, but sometimes. Otherwise we would not all be here today, right?"

The words of the priest gave me no comfort. "Chrissy, I think I might be losing it. Chrissy?"

Tears ran freely down her cheeks, like raindrops down a window or something. "Mom yelled at me for refusing having an open casket. But I had my reasons. You know they put a plug up in there, right? For the gas. That's part of the process. Decay. Lots of gas. If not for the plug there'd be constant farting. And who can grieve their loved one while their loved one ... farts?"

"I'm sure you did the right thing, Chrissy."

"I just didn't want to have to look at him, knowing that inside his ... there was a ...."

Chrissy sobbed like a person who had just seen or heard something real sad. I shook my head. This wasn't right. This wasn't right at all.

"Don't cry. Well you can cry. It's a funeral. But I mean, don't cry over the buttp—"

"Don't say it!"

Chrissy slapped me, and they all looked. The priest rolled his eyes, all priestly.

I stood up. "Everyone! There's going to be a resolution. A resolution to all of this. We are here for a purpose. We ... exist. There's a reason to it. I'm sure. This isn't a Waffle House, but maybe that's alright. Maybe this makes sense. Somehow. There are ... layers."

That was when my mother, Cinthrel Shannon, came over and delivered a devastating message. "Your father was in that Walgreens that day to pick up your antipsychotics, Finn. He blew up ... because of *you*."

Oh no.

It was all my fault.

"I didn't even know I was psychotic."

"Psychotic people don't know they're psychotic," said my mother, Cinthrel Shannon. "That's how it works, right?"

"Right," said Chrissy. "I've heard that."

"Alright," said the priest. "Let's keep it moving."

And they kept it moving.

My mother, Cinthrel Shannon, sighed. "If only it were an open casket."

"Wait," I said. "He blew up. What would they even put in the casket? An exploded corpse can't even fart. Can it?"

Chrissy gave me another slap and my mother joined in. The priest smiled and loosened his collar. Then he came barking as well. They all took turns, slapping me raw.

I gasped for air. In between slaps, of course. "Is—Is this Waffle House?"

"Yes," said my mother, Cinthrel Shannon. Her eyes were all red and swollen, like the eyes of someone with a case of pink eye. "Yes it is."
