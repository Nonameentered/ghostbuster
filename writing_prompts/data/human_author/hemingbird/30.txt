Bilbomesh hovered in the air for a few seconds, then he exploded. Yellow guts painted the walls of the cave, and my fellow adventures howled with laughter.

"That's supposed to be an S-rank dungeon boss? It was a cakewalk!"

"It's almost like we're just crushing bugs at this point."

Jake, our water mage, adjusted his spider-silk robe and let out a deep sigh. "So, what's next?"

I checked the quest log for updates, but all I could see were completed quests. Scrolling down, I felt a slight tinge of nostalgia. Ever since the world 'plunged into darkness' ten years ago, dungeon crawling was all I'd done. My guild, The Lonesome Slackers, reached S-rank years ago but the difficulty of quests in general had remained in stasis. It had become gruntwork. Explore the dungeon. Kill the boss. Collect the treasure. Where was the fun?

"Oh, there's only one quest available right now," I said.

"Tell us," said Sabine, our healer. "What's the rank?"

I looked up. "D."

"Huh?" said Jake. "Did I hear that right? D-rank? We haven't done one of those in years."

"Maybe we should just hit the tavern," said our trusty tank, Bobstanley. "I hear there's a new brew with saffron berries and mead."

Jake groaned. "Let's just take it."

"What?"

"So what if it's a D-rank quest? Let's just get 'er done before someone swoops in and steals it."

"Who'd want to steal a D-rank quest?" said Sabine, scratching her long chin.

Jake shrugged. "We'll complete the quest, then we'll hit the tavern. Sounds good?"

"Eh," said Sabine.

"Eh," I concurred.

And so it was decided.

The old man inspected us from head to toe, frowning. "There's just four of you? Whiskers isn't your regular cat. She's got something nasty about her."

"I'm sure we'll ... manage."

"I don't know," he said. "She's more tiger than cat. That said ..." He stared at Sabine intently.

"What?" she said.

The old man looked over at us. "What's wrong with her chin? It's awfully long."

"Hey! That's uncalled for!"

The old man shrugged. "I don't know if I'm comfortable leaving this quest in your hands. You could get hurt."

"It's a D-rank quest, grandpa," said Bobstanley. "We're S-rank adventurers." He rolled his eyes. "I think we're good."

"If you say so ..."

It felt strange going on a non-dungeon quest. Once the dungeons appeared and magic returned to Earth, people developed strange powers that could be improved with experience. But most people had none. After a while, adventurers started getting recruited for menial tasks. D-rank and E-rank questers would often start out that way, so they'd learn the ropes before trying their hands on actual dungeons. Also, we S-rankers felt good about ourselves that way, having dungeon crawling be a serious affair for senior adventurers. But really, an E-rank dungeon would be perfectly manageable even for someone without powers. Picture a bunch of rats in leather outfits, trying to look intimidating. That's your average E-rank boss. You can just stomp them. But eh.

"Whiskers! Whiskers!"

"Cats are dumb, Sabine. There's no use in calling its name."

"You don't know that. He said the cat was really smart. Like a tiger."

"He said it was *nasty* like a tiger."

"Are tigers nasty?"

"I have no idea. I've never met one."

We had no luck searching for the cat at random. Bobstanley suggested we just put up some posters and head to the tavern, waiting for calls. But Jake refused, saying that it went against the basic principles of questing.

"If only we had a ranger in our party ..."

"Cats are scared of water, right?" Jake nodded to himself. "Maybe I'll just summon some rain clouds and we'll see if little Whiskers comes running?"

"Wouldn't she be running away from the rain?"

"I could make a huge circle of rain, then slowly shrink it. That should work, right?"

"You idiot," said Sabine. "The cat will just seek shelter."

"Oh," said Jake. "I hadn't thought about that. Guess we'll just have to keep our chins up."

Sabine stared daggers at Jake, then turned toward me. "What about you, Flem? Can't you summon some dead cats? Maybe they were friends with Whiskers. Or maybe Whiskers died. He'd still pay us for an undead cat, right?"

I checked the quest listing. "It doesn't say anything about the cat having to be alive, so ..."

"That settles it! Let's see some necro-kitties!"

---

The armada of undead cats in various stages of putrefaction stared at us, meowing ominously.

"Any of them fit the description?"

"Well ... It's sort of hard to tell. They're all ... rotten."

"I need a drink," said Bobstanley.

One of the cats staggered over to me and scratched my leg as if it were scratching a coffin. It stared at me with its dead eyes, then one of them popped out. "Meow?" it said.

"This isn't working," said Sabine.

"Maybe I can have them search for Whiskers?" I suggested.

"Or whiskey," offered Bobstanley.

Jake sighed. "Go ahead. Send your army of undead cats searching."

It was worth a shot, I figured. "*Go find Whiskers*," I commanded them. They slithered off purring with the intensity of death itself, like bugs from under an uplifted rock.

Ten minutes later, they returned. Not with Whiskers. But with something ... else.

"What the hell!?" cried Jake. "W-What is that thing?"

"Judging by the number of legs, I think it's fair to say it's not a cat," said Sabine, before vomiting.

The cats purred. *We have retrieved Whiskers, master,* they said via our mind connection. I looked up at the disgusting abomination with dozens of legs, scales, and claws. "A-Are you sure about that?"

The creature growled and the earth shook. *We are confident*, said the cats. *This is Whiskers the cat*.
