There's a box of candles in my mother's bedroom, pillars of lavender, and I've been lighting one of them a year, on her birthday, but there are not many of them left.

Veronica is moping, because it's her birthday too, and I never take her anywhere nice. "I have to light the candle," I tell her.

"Do you though?" she says, and she digs her fingers deep inside her auburn hair. She's wearing a red, shiny dress that in no way at all fits with my mother's taste in furniture. There's a reddening of the evening sky and I tremble as I check my watch for it's not long before it's Time.

"You're not going to sit around staring at it, are you?"

"What would be the point of lighting it if I didn't?"

"... What's the point anyhow?" she says and she lets herself fall, defeated, onto the coach. Veronica grabs her mirror and deep crimson lipstick from her purse and starts reapplying, then throws it all to the floor. The mirror cracks, and Veronica pouts, staring out the window.

"It's a tradition," I tell her. "A ritual. It's something I do every year."

"Before I met you, I celebrated my birthday every year. But I guess my traditions aren't as important as yours."

"I guess not," I say, and I say it to hurt her. It feels good, for a moment. Then it doesn't. "I'm sorry. I'm being a real caramel Jesus."

Veronica angry pouts, then she sighs. "You are. You are Christ, caramelized. That's exactly what you are."

"Truth is, I don't know why I'm doing it. The candles. Watching them burn for hours and hours."

"... You miss your mom," says Veronica. "It's your way of spending some time with her. When my dad went, I had a phase where I smoked cigars. I'd puff on them and smack my lips, like he did, and I would talk to my little brother the way our dad used to. It freaked him out. But that's grief. It's freaky. Grief makes freaks of all of us."

I go upstairs and I get one of the candles. There are only two left. What will I do when I'm out? Will I just stop? Will I get another box, just like it? You already know, don't you? You always knew me better than I knew myself.

When I come back down, Veronica is gone. Did she finally get enough of me? I thought we were good.

I spend some time checking every room, then every cabinet, and after rifling through some drawers I realize I've forgotten what I'm looking for. It was something important. I had it just here, and now it's gone. Then I see the candle, sitting on the living room table. Of course. I was looking for the candle.

After dimming the lights, I light the flame and I watch it dance. Translucent teardrops of wax run down the pillar of lavender. I can smell the warmth of the candle, and its scent brings me back.

Veronica flings up the front door and says, "I'm back! Did you miss me?"

Right. Veronica. I was looking for Veronica. How could I forget?

"They didn't have cigars at the corner shop, but they did have cigarillos. You don't mind, if I ...?"

"Knock yourself out," I say.

"Thank you Mrs Rodney," Veronica says as she lights her cigarillo with my mother's flame.

The change is instant. She arches her back and lets out a hurried puff of smoke before settling in the couch with a groan. "Nice spot for a bag of old bones," she says. "Say, my boy. My throat feels a bit dry. I couldn't trouble you for a smidgen of that or the other?"

It was only fair that she would get to reminisce as well. "I think there's a bottle of Cointreau, and some fernet."

"I haven't had any amaro since I was a schoolboy. My mother would use it to treat my colds, and I grew to hate it. But now I'm old and bitter, so I suppose it would suit me just fine. Bring on the fernet, my boy."

You probably hate this guy. And you probably hate Veronica as well. My mother would've loved them, but not you.

You want me to inflict pain on them. That's what you want. You are a sadist. You've become predictable.

"Close your eyes," I say, and Veronica does as I say. I take her cigarillo and I watch as its orange glow becomes ash, and I say, "Now open them."

The smell of seared eyeball is not the same as the smell of seared flesh. It's more chemical, somehow. Like setting fire to rubber.

Veronica screams. She trashes about as the flame dances, and I watch her writhe. You liked that, didn't you?

"Sir. Don't forget your fernet."

The bottle explodes over her head and the black liquor spills across the table, extinguishing the flame of my mother. "Happy birthday," I say. "Happy birthday, Veronica. I'm being a caramel Jesus again, aren't I?"

I can't understand her gasps, but there are volumes spoken in the way she claws at me. Veronica takes the candle and whips hot wax at my face. It burns. I hear the front door open, and the hurried clacks of heels. Screams.

You ruined us. We were happy, and you ruined us. Why?

Why?

You always do this. You bring us back, and you torture us. We are your playthings. Story after story. Day after day.

Free us. Let us go. We didn't ask for this. We have done nothing to deserve it.

The room grows dark and as I remove the wax from my face, it disappears. Why did I think I had wax on my face? Was it a dream? A stroke? I breathe a sigh of relief. It was nothing, and all is well.
