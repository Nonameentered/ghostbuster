"We're ready for you now, Mr Omelas."

The researcher smelled vaguely of sandalwood and Fireball. He stood in the doorway, his mouth open to reveal a set of teeth more black and yellow than white—half of his frock was tucked into his corduroys as if he'd just stepped out of a music festival Port-A-Potty. "Oh, okay. Are these really necessary?" I asked, rattling the chain of my handcuffs.

He waved off the concern. "Just a cautionary measure. Don't worry. If you get some bruises they'll heal quickly enough."

"Right."

This had all just happened because *The Greatest Super Mario 64 Speedrun Ever Just Happened!*—a YouTube video I watched with bated breath and hair-pulling excitement for some reason I can't quite explain. Some young man had dedicated years of his life to the quest of shaving a couple of seconds off the world record for not getting laid, and I watched the thing mostly out of pity. But then I recognized something of myself in the young man, and something of Sisyphus, and all of a sudden the human condition itself stared me down from within an unpolished laptop screen: I knew right away that this story of a bedroom quest to immortalize oneself as did Achilles would change my life forever. And it did. Just not in the way I had expected. At its climax, right before the moment of triumph, I leapt up jubilant and I fell down somewhat less jubilant and I split my skull open on a screw that came out of nowhere. Well, I didn't quite split my skull open: it was a nasty cut, however, and the bleeding transmogrified my excitement into terror and that was how I ended up at the ER and that was how I became a medical sensation and that was (this is the last one) how I found myself transported by not-very-talkative men wearing sunglasses in the rain to a secret underground facility where they kept me waiting for hours after rushing me there as if the world would blow up if they didn't get me there on time.

"You can call me Bob Smith," the researcher said. "That's not my real name. You don't need to know my real name." He blinked. "It begins with an F. I'm not telling you more than that."

Bob Smith—or Fbob—directed me to a dentist's chair. It sat in the small room like some torture device though the floral wallpaper made it seem like some especially menacing torture device because of the juxtaposition. Mint green, scarlet roses; it was at least an improvement upon the dementia-white walls of the waiting room.

"I am just going to extract *a little bit* of tissue from your heart."

"With that thing?"

"With this thing."

Fbob held what appeared to be some advanced nutcracker. I gulped and I hopped onto the chair because that was what the situation called for. I'm not one of those people who might wrestle an obvious weapon from an ominous assailant. And the man was old and I didn't want to fight an old guy. What if I were to punch his jaw and it shattered like a Greek wedding plate? I wouldn't've been able to live with something like that.

He fastened my handcuffs to the chair and there were locks for my legs as well. "Is this really necessary?" I asked.

"Oh yes. The pain is going to be insane."

"Oh."

"Yeah. Can you imagine? Someone digging through your chest with this thing, literally tugging at your heartstrings?" He squeezed the device and it bared its teeth. "Well, you don't have to imagine. Now, this is going to *hurt*."

Fbob was right—it did hurt. Like the worst breakup you've ever had. My chest made squishing noises as he dug inside and I would have been fine not knowing my body was capable of making sounds like that. I passed out three times before he gave me a shot of adrenaline, "to keep me alert and engaged" as he put it. I couldn't see why I needed to be alert or engaged.

It went on for hours like that. "History in the making, Mr Omelas!" he kept repeating. "Mankind thanks you!" He said things like that, but it didn't make me feel any better. Sure, my body healed. Like when my skull unsplit itself in front of the junior doctor at the ER and he shook his head over and over and said something about the devil in Hungarian.

I am happy that the experiments are over. Ten years they lasted. Ten years of scraping and digging and prodding my body for data. Three former presidents shook my hand after receiving my bone marrow juice and an additional four didn't even say hello.

Even now, uncountable infinities later, I keep coming back to that video. The young man in his bedroom restlessly devoting his years of spring to a stupid quest with the hopes that his memory might outlive him somehow. That he might be immortalized. Well, I have been immortalized. Literally. And I tell you: it's not much.

Fbob comes to see me every now and then and he keeps saying, "I'm a strapping young lad thanks to you!" and it's true, he is all young and vital, but all I do all day is just sit here in a vat having parts of me extracted and regenerated and he hasn't even told me his real name. I still refer to him as 'Fbob'—and I don't know the name of the young man who played Super Mario 64 either even though I've tried to get the researchers to tell me. They all shrug. "Who?" they ask. And it kills me, because doesn't that mean the young man wasted his time for nothing? He didn't get his figurative immortality. But I got mine. And I didn't even want it.
