"Grru?"

"N-No, your highness. Let's go this way."

I had covered up king Edgar's broken neck with a shawl, but it didn't look entirely convincing. Reanimated, he was far more pleasant to be around than when he was still alive. He didn't pester me with stuff he'd heard about the rejuvenating effects of baby dragon blood. He didn't keep making vague threats about what would happen to me if I weren't successful in extending his life. The flatulence had gotten worse, though.

"Gruuuu! Grr-gru?"

"Up here. Watch the steps."

We made it through his secret dungeon without anyone seeing us. I figured if I could just get him in bed, his men would assume he'd had a stroke. The magic would wear off in a day or so. It would all seem perfectly natural. I hoped.

"There you are! King Edgar! The Braddurians are storming the castle!"

My blood nearly went as cold as that of the dead king. To our left was a lowly water mage, drenched in sweat, and from his startled look the situation seemed serious.

"... Gru?"

"What? Oh, yes! The Braddurian army grew and they have far more men than we could have anticipated. We are giving them all we've got, but morale is low. They need you now more than ever, my dear king!"

I pushed the king out in front of me. "I'll find my way out!" I said and turned to leave.

"Wait!" cried the water mage. "Aren't you a fellow magician? We need all hands on deck."

Darn it.

We gathered on the main castle roof, where archers, mages, and other long-range fighters were desperately trying to keep off the Braddurians.

"King! It's good to see you. And what an excellent shawl. It's quite befitting of a man of your stature."

"Gru-gru."

"A guru? Well, the closest thing we have is our seer. She tells us the battle will be close, but we will eventually come out on top."

Green and yellow and blue flashes of magic burst in the air all around. The king reached out his hands and wandered towards them. "Gruuu!"

"King!"

"Your majesty!"

King Edgar walked off the roof and splashed into bits on the rocks below.

It was gruesome.
