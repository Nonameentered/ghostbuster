"Frostie," the mouse whimpered and punctured my everyday state of subdued bliss.

My Ragdoll, Frostie, averted her eyes and let out a soft meow before hurriedly escaping through the pet flap. The mouse stranded on my Goodwill carpet reached out a paw, stretching not-so-much towards me I suppose as much as towards life itself. Then it collapsed, élan vital and all, and left me with a mystery.

First of all, it surprised me that the mouse could speak and that I could understand it. Mice can't speak. Everyone knows. But this one could. And it did.

Perhaps it escaped from some laboratory. Experiment on a million mice, and you'd expect at least one to emerge with strange powers. Or maybe I was losing it. A mouse spoke my cat's name with its dying breath. Didn't Nietzsche speak with horses before succumbing to syphilis? Well, there was little chance that I'd contracted just that myself; I'd ace any STD test. At least it would have to be an accident. Accidental syphilis? Was that a thing? Would there be a single hit on Google if I searched for it?

It was, indeed, a thing. The first hit was from a medical journal—The Lancet—and an article therein with the title *Accidental Syphilis in Medical Men* from 1923. I couldn't rule it out, then.

Frostie entered the house again, bearing yet another catch. She seemed to be hunting for sport, for the mice were never dead when she brought them inside. Rather, they were maimed. I didn't like the implication. My dear Frostie? A sociopath? I imagined a future where cats were the dominant species. Would their culture be deeply reflective of suppressed murderous urges? Would there be a cat Freud? Would cats grow tired of him? Would he endorse the leisurely use of cocaine?

"Why don't you eat them?" I asked Frostie, who turned her head and stared at me with a quizzical glance.

"Pain!" squeaked the mouse. "Paaaaaaain ..."

"Oh dear," I said.

Frostie dropped her mouse on the floor, limp, and again she scurried for the flap in the door. This time, however, I decided to follow her. After getting rid of her deceased offerings, of course.

She noticed right away that I was following her, and it seemed to make her awkward. This offended me somewhat. Would the other neighborhood cats think less of her if her owner followed her along? I guess cats treasure their independence. But still.

Frostie's ears perked up, and though I couldn't hear a thing it was clear that she had picked up on something. Another mouse? Another *talking* mouse? Had there been a radioactive spill nearby? I supposed that sort of thing could explain it. The radiation might do sciency things with their genomes and they'd start talking. Was that absurd? Perhaps it was absurd.

As I stalked my cat as she stalked her prey, I made sure to look over my shoulder in case the pattern should repeat. Luckily, there were no assailants in sight. But what happened when Frostie found her mouse shocked me: the mouse was already hurt. Frostie leaned down and gently carried her in her mouth. And that was when I realized what was going on: Frostie was trying to help! These poor mice had become wounded, and Frostie brought them to me, perhaps thinking I might know how to sort it out.

"I am no medicine woman," I said and I petted her head gently.

"I'm not comfortable with this," said the mouse.

"A full sentence!" I cried out. This one was more advanced than the others. "Hello, dear mouse! I am Fiona. I suppose I am an ambassador for humanity. How is it that you can talk?"

"I'm bleeding. My guts are hanging out. Get a doctor! You'll have to forgive me, but I'm not in the mood for explaining my linguistic prowess right now."

"Oh dear," I said, and searched online for the number for the closest veterinarian. But before I could dial it, it was already too late.

"Forget it," said the mouse. "There's not much time left for me. I might as well tell you what you want to know. The reason why I can talk is—"

Just then, a trio of mice in business suits wearing tiny sunglasses leapt out from a hole in the wall and shot at the dying mouse. Frostie attacked them and they ran off after dropping a minuscule smoke bomb. I was horrified to realize that I had opened a mouse version of Pandora's box. It was a conspiracy, presumably all the way to the top of whatever government these chatty mice had formed. They had secret agents. And official-looking outfits.

As it would later turn out, I did have accidental syphilis.
