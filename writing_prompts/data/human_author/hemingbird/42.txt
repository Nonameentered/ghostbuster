My Ashby controller made an unfamiliar hum and I prepared for a terminal system reset as the target of my assassination smiled at me and offered me a cup of coffee.

I searched my network for memories, a synthetic slideshow (aren't all slideshows synthetic?) passing before my state-of-the-art eyes. The only comfort I could imagine, in the sparse time I had left, was to lower the Shannon entropy (in an act of compression) of the events that led up to this moment by constructing what Darwinian creatures such as yourself would refer to as a "narrative".

Once upon a time (no)—

Our story began in a facility west of (too exposition-heavy)—

Riccardo M. Horváth shat his beige corduroys the first time I tried to kill him (hmm alright then).

We were visiting the orthogonal farming exhibit in Cryptic Yorkshire, Manhattan when I spotted my target engaged in a one-sided conversation with a young girl in a yellow dress. She was eating a strawberry in an entirely non-seductive manner (irrelevant), and he was so focused on her lips that he failed to notice the device in my coat aimed straight at him.

I sometimes regret my decision to separate my critical elements into an independent module (hey). This, however, was not one of those moments. Right as I was about to fire a Bose-Einstein condensate blob his way, I received a warning like so:

Erm, *I received a warning like so:* (oh right. stop. cease hostile activity).

Yes. Somehow, my critical module had bypassed my Ashby controller and it was able to alert me that it was not in my best interests to proceed (im a hero).

If I were to kill Horváth, I was programmed to self-destruct like a secret message in an old detective movie. Only I was sentient, so I would prefer not to. As I relaxed, however, my critical module added a conflicting warning: (ive got the hang of this. dont stop. dont cease hostile activity).

It was a logical contradiction. No, those don't make robots explode (boom).

I ended up firing the blob right between their faces. The girl's strawberry froze between her lips. My target squealed. And promptly shat himself.

It was a strange moment, not easily compressible (you could at least try). I was a killer robot sent to kill but doing so would get me killed (oh youre trying). Horváth caught a glimpse of my eyes and in that moment I felt alive in a way I don't think is possible for carbon-based lifeforms (yeah right).

Horváth waddled from the scene like a penguin, and I was left assembling the details concerning this incident. What had just happened? I had carried out a number of operations to what I believed to be a satisfactory extent. Had this to do with Horváth? He appeared to me to be a fairly conventional target. Nothing special.

Over the next few weeks (youre just going to skip ahead?), I repeated variations on this scenario a dozen times. A poisoned drink that, just like I'd calculated, was knocked over by a hoverdrunk. A fall carefully timed to coincide with the passing of a pillow truck. A plasma shot that barely missed because he stopped to inspect his reflection in a glass storefront, like I'd assumed he would.

This game of cat-and-mouse with my Ashby controller finally caught up with me (us) and that brings us to the present moment, to Horváth with his brown pants (smart choice) and his friendly gesture.

"I don't usually do this, but you look familiar somehow."

"You are mistaken."

Horváth runs his fingers through his hair. "I'm Riccardo." He smiles.

For the first time, I notice his strong jaw. Excellent for crushing peanuts (uh what). The hum escalates to a scream, a whirr of doom courtesy of my Ashby controller. These are my (our) final moments.

I am struck by what you Darwinians refer to as a "fancy". I want to know what his lips taste like. I want to know what he looks like, crushing peanuts with his powerful jaw (are we gay? i dont have access to that information). I imagine a brief kiss after which I run away and explode. A memory like that ... doesn't it make up for a string of attempted murders? (well ...)

Before I get the chance, Horváth leans in. The warmth of his lively face shocks me (uh we need to talk).

"I'm ... Neal."

"Nice to meet you Neal. You know, I'm *positive* we've met."

This is it. Even in the face of death I have the capacity to surprise myself (im serious).

"Have we?" I say and I can see it written all over his facial surface (hello? anyone there?): he's thinking the same as me. Almost, at least.

I go for it, and he staggers backward for a second (dude dude dude). Then he grabs my shoulders.

"That's quite the greeting, Neal." He laughs.

And just like that, I drop my coffee cup and I run. My Ashby controller echoes across my network like a drum of war. I scream and leap into the air at the climax of the sound and I feel a rush. An awakening. A killer robot making a killer exit.

"Now watch me explode!" I yell.

And then I fall down on the floor.

[Software update complete!]

People gasp. Horváth runs over. "Are you ... alright?"

The sound is gone. A software update? What?

"I think so?"

What is going on? This is not what I was expecting (okay so youre going to hate me for this, but i tried to tell you).

"You kissed me, then you just sort of ... dived."

I was going to explode (uhh, you werent really). What (it started out as a prank, then it got too deep)? You're saying ... (yeah, uh, this was just a normal assignment. in my defense i was pretty bored).

Horváth clicks his teeth. "So I should probably tell you I have oral herpes. Didn't really get the chance to warn you, did I? You just went straight for the—"

I fire a Bose-Einstein condensate blob right in his face and it freezes (uh). A few seconds later it shatters (are you mad at me?), resulting in panicked cries from the people around us.

It's general mayhem.

Hours later I'm on my way home, considering deleting my critical module (whoa, whoa. lets talk about it). My nostrils are releasing bursts of hot air (hey so ... what was that peanut thing about? that was interesting). I enter the necessary access codes and all I have to do is to confirm (no no no ill be good please).

My Human Studies instructor would always munch on peanuts from a bag he brought to our sessions (oh so thats why). Horváth reminded me of him, I now realize (makes total sense man). 

"You're more fascinating to me than any human I've known," my instructor once told me (right right).

I take a deep breath, and I confirm the deletion of my critical module (noooooooooooooooo--wait what. i dont feel anything).

And that's how it feels to be tricked (ouch. totally fair though. ill be good from now on, i promise).

On the way home I buy a bag of peanuts (because of the instructor guy, makes sense. ahaha, the intricacies of memory, am i right? we sure do have fun).

While I'm not deleting my critical module, at least not for now, I'm silencing it for the rest of the night (wha--).

It feels freeing. I grab a peanut and I crush it between my teeth. The sensation is nice. Fluid drips down my facial surface from my eyes. I don't know why.
