Jesus Christ sat on my pristine velveteen sofa drinking MTN DEW © MAJOR MELON™ while his son, fresh out of rehab, held on to my Berber rug for dear life. "Easy now, Fuckhead," said Jesus. "Jim's gonna kick us right out of here if you don't shape up." The Savior gave me a red-eyed stare. "He'll put us on the street. He's an atheist. He doesn't *care*."

"I'm going to fall. I'm falling."

"Steer clear of the sun then, Icarus." Jesus looked up at me. "We get all types up there. In the God Mansion. Daedalus, Icarus, even that bull. What was his name?"

I sighed. "The Minotaur?"

Jesus shook his hands with excitement. Red soda spilled all over. It smelled strangely acidid. "That's the guy! Loves to fuck with Moses."

"I'm falling!"

Jesus's son, Fuckhead, rolled around in tears. His father let out a faint grunt of disapproval.

For two weeks they had been crashing at my place. The day they showed up, Jesus told me he was on a special mission to save non-believers from hellfire and he demonstrated his miracles to the extent that even Dawkins would be forced to accept defeat: he brought my cat back to life. It smells a bit funny and it meows like a broken chainsaw but it's clearly my cat. My Jammy. The sight of his half-putrefied paws clawing at some imagined ball of yarn made my heart melt like a pair of eyeballs exposed to 20 sieverts of nuclear blue light. A couple of days later, Jesus changed. He said he couldn't shower due to 'allergies'. His son fed me a cheeseburger laced with something that shattered my misconception that I were a specific individual and it penetrated my very being with the epiphany that we are all aspects of a grand consciousness on a cosmic scale and also I couldn't pee for two days after that.

"I'm going to Heaven, right?" I asked the Redeemer.

"Huh?"

"You know. The God Mansion."

"Oh! Right. Of course. You've been putting up with us for like a week. That's all it takes, really."

"So."

"So?"

"Wasn't that the reason why you came here in the first place? To save me?"

Fuckhead snorted.

"Shut the hell up," said Jesus and he threw his soda can at his bumbling son.

"Ow. That hurt. Don't throw things at me."

"Don't let go of the rug, son. Oh shit. You're falling."

"I'm falling!"

Jesus laughed uproariously. "Hey. Tell Jim about the time you went hitchhiking. Oh man. That story always gets me."

Clutching the fibers of the rug with all the strength he could muster, Fuckhead sobbed. "I'm dying and you don't even care. You're my father and you don't care."

"There was this accident," said Jesus, stroking his wild beard. "And Fuckhead could've stopped it. He's a precog. Crazy, right? But he was so hopped up on I don't even fucking know and he just let it happen, didn't even intervene until the folks were already dead."

"I'm dying!"

"That's ... a neat story." I cleared my throat. "So, I have already been saved and you two are now staying here because ...?"

"Fuckhead saw 9/11 coming as well. Didn't care, I guess. Me? I was furious. We slipped up. Dropped the ball on that one. But you know what? Those hordes of evangelicals, you know what they did after the towers went all poof? They prayed *harder*. I guess Fuckhead saw that as well."

"I didn't see shit." Fuckhead, now barely lucid, stood up wobbling. "All I can see is misery and I can see that there's no point to it, that suffering is ultimately meaningless and soon all life on this planet will die and once that happens there won't be any more believers and we'll all die as well."

Jesus's son staggered over to his father and he collapsed over his lap. Grabbing Jesus's dirty tunic he said, "We're trapped on a speck of dust scorched by a burning ball of gas and you told me this guy was our only hope but so far he's done nothing. Nothing!"

"C-Calm the fuck down."

"What?" I said. "What's he talking about?"

Jesus released a stilted laugh. "He's high out of his mind, don't worry about whatever nonsense he's spewing."

"No," said Fuckhead. "You told me. Jim. He's our only hope. The only being who can save the planet. Who can save *us*."

"I'll turn your cerebrospinal fluid to fucking wine if you don't shut the hell up."

"Do it," said Fuckhead. He sobbed. "You don't care about me. Just do it."

Jammy entered the living room and let out a chainsaw meow. Jesus's son wept.

"He's not being serious?" I asked.

Jesus took a hard look at me and he sighed. "Sorry kiddo. I didn't want to burden you with all of this. Thought we might just hang out instead. But yeah. The world's doomed and you're the only person who might save it."

"W-What?"

"You are ..." said Jesus and he licked his lips meticulously, "the Chosen Atheist."
