It always rains in Trenshorn, buckets and jars overflow by habit, and that is why the fishlings chose it as their place of settlement. Only, it doesn't rain today. The sun scorches us from overhead and everywhere there is a smell of dried cod.

"Let's just head back, Banaroth. That door won't budge."

Our spellcaster picks up a handful of soil and inspects it closely. "Yes. I can see it clearly. We're not getting in."

They are a timid bunch dressed in leather rags pilfered, I suspect, from villagers even more timid than the members of my party. "Ghuzanne! Pelori! What is this I hear? Do you not have faith in your leader?"

Wenneth the archer gulps. "It is not that we don't have faith, Banny—I mean Banaroth—it's just that ..."

"It's just that we've been standing here for an hour," says Ghuzanne. Her arms are folded and she's looking mighty strict though she's standing before the legendary hero of Arncast: Banaroth the Intrepid.

"Also there's a festival in town. We don't want to miss it." Perlori snacks on her soil.

At the altar in front of us lies my Saber of Valor, Staff of Obedience, Ring of Fortune, Ring of Fortitude, the Elk-Ranger Talisman, some coins, my shoes, my armor, and all my clothes and items. All of it. It sits in a great pile. *Sacrifice that which you hold most dear to proceed* reads the inscription on the door but I haven't got anything left to sacrifice.

"Well, perhaps we should head back before the rain."

Ghuzanne looks around. "I don't think there's going to be rain. The sky's all clear."

"It always rains in Trenshorn."

"But it's not raining right now, is it?" says Wenneth and rage rushes through my rivers of blood.

These younglins have no respect for sayings. My mother told me when I was but a child that it always rains in Trenshorn and I believed her. It was the truth. When I arrived for the very first time in the town it didn't rain and as it happens I can't recall ever having been here when it rained. But those are exceptions that prove the rule. It always rains in Trenshorn.

"Just because it doesn't rain right now," I tell him, "that doesn't mean it doesn't always rain. You, Wenneth, always have something clever to say. Not that I've ever heard you say something clever. But that doesn't mean it's not true."

Wenneth loads his bow with a sullen look. "Maybe your life is what you hold most dear? Would make sense, wouldn't it?"

"W-What?"

"Oh! That must be the answer to the riddle," Pelori says and she claps her hands. Soil flies everywhere.

"Or maybe it's that snail between your legs," says Ghuzanne.

"Snail! What, I ... You can't even see it from where you're standing."

"I don't think I'd be able to see it no matter where I was standing."

They all laugh and the humiliation is complete. I release a deep sigh of resignation. "Okay. Fine. Let's head back. Let's just forget all about questing and exploration and adventure and let's just enjoy ourselves at the festival."

The goblins *cheer*.

"I'm so excited for the food!" screams Pelori.

"... You eat mud," I grumble, "why are you excited about the food?"

"Whoa whoah. Pelori eats soil for her divination. She gets her intel from the worms." Ghuzanne turns her hear towards Pelori. "That's right, isn't it?"

Pelori nods. She's chewing on something. I bet it's mud. She's not even prophesying anything. She's just eating it. I want to make a comment but I doubt they'll take my side.

I walk over to the altar to retrieve my belongings. I consider their combined value and I reflect on the memories they represent. I was a young man back when I got most of them. Like Wenneth. They all represent danger and hope and the importance of facing your fears no matter the odds—well except for my clothes because those are just my clothes. It's not like my socks mean anything.

There was a reason why I wanted to bring them here, to Trenshorn, where it always rains. This was where it all began. Where I met him. My mentor. I joined a party and we traveled all over the realm fighting monsters and crawling through dungeons and taking on whatever job happened to be available. And we did it all together. I wonder what those guys are doing now. Those who remain, I mean.

I've never seen a fishling. My mother used to tell me stories, about how they'd be caught in fishermen's nets, about their great plight from the ocean to the town of Trenshorn. I thought I'd found one once but turned out it was only a merman. He hadn't even been to Trenshorn.

"Uh, Banaroth? Are you alright?"

Wenneth clears his throat. "I think he's having a senior moment," he says in a hushed voice.

I ignore them and I lean down to pick up the Staff of Obediance. Perhaps I can just give it a little swing to teach them some respect for their elders. No, they'd only end up mocking me for it later.

As I reach down I feel a pain in my back. "Oh!" I shout as I fall down on the altar, hitting my head on the Elk-Ranger Talisman. "Ow ..."

"Wait, that's ..."

"Huh?"

"It's ... It's not even the size of a snail!"

They laugh and none of them ask me if I'm alright after that nasty fall. A lone tear escapes my eye and I hurry to wipe it off so that they won't see. But wait. There's movement. The alter lights up, green and fluorescent.

"The door! The door is opening!" shouts Ghuzanne.

Pelori opens her mouth wide and soil drips down her chin.

It opened? But how?

Slowly the insides are revealed; walls covered in gold and jewels poking out from the ground, glittering. It is the greatest treasure trove I have ever laid my weary eyes on.

Someone clears their throat. "Greetings, Banaroth the Intrepid. You have sacrificed that which you hold most dear and now you shall receive your rightful reward."

There's someone standing in the entrance. He looks like a man, though somewhat sickly. His skin is grey, his eyes bulging out from their sockets, and his gills are slimy and—wait. Gills? "Y-You are a fishling?"

"Oh," says the man. "Yes. That's right."

There are oohs and awws coming from my party. They can't believe it. And neither can I.

"But what did I sacrifice exactly?" I ask the fishling. A fishling! My mother's stories were all true! I knew it all along of course. I never doubted them for a second.

The fishling makes a gesture with his webbed hands. "What you sacrificed, Banaroth the Intrepid, was nothing short of your pride. It was your greatest treasure. Now it is no more."

Oh. That's right. They saw my snail. I mean, my—

"T-This is incredible," says Ghuzanne.

"Great work, Banny!"

"Very clever, boss. You intentionally made us ridicule you so that you could elegantly collapse on the altar, deprived of your precious pride." Wenneth nods sagely.

"Oh ... Intentionally. Yes. Of course."

The fishling smiles. "You best get dressed. And you should all come inside: it always rains in Trenshorn."

My heart swells but if this feeling in my chest is not pride, what then? I cast a glance back at my pile of rubble and my party. They're cheering and running around in ecstasy. Of course. This is not pride.

This feeling is that of gratitude.
