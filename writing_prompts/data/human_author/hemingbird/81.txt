The androids cackled mechanically as oil and blood mixed on the battlefield. "It's time to put humanity on a low-carbon diet," said their ringleader Lin Luxor. "What's the difference between androids and plastic surgeons? I'll fill you with silicon for free!"

Albert Scofflund shielded his head from flying fragments of steel and bone. He hadn't even graduated Super Fun Magic School College yet, so why did he have to sneak out to join the resistance in their fight against the android militia? Was it because his mother had left his father for a Roomba? Was it because everyone at school teased him for his short stature? Or was it just a random impulse he'd had and he followed it on a whim because of his ADHD and now he wanted to escape the situation like a new hobby in the first week of trying it out?

"Don't just stand there, twerp! Do something!"

The fire mage in front of him scolded Albert as he made cyborg circuits crackle and hiss. Albert wanted to disappear. But there was no way out. He was surrounded on all sides. So he might as well, he thought, do something to help.

He reached into his leather pouch and felt for the glass vial containing his potion of focus. It had helped him out with his exams. Perhaps it could help him here as well. But after emptying in, Albert didn't feel focused. For a second he thought the fire mage had set him ablaze. But when he checked the label on the vial, he realized that his situation was far worse. He had drunk liquid rage. The most dangerous potion known to man.

Lin Luxor howled in the distance. "Guess my favorite writer," he said, and punched a hole a human fighter's magic shield. "It's Borges."

"Did your logic board malfunction, you sub-human piece of tangled wires?"

"Who said that?" Lin Luxor scanned the area.

"You know why androids have such a hard time dating? They're all ones and zeros."

"Show yourself!" cried Lin Luxor. In a display of dominance, he fired laser beams into the sky.

"I'm tired of hearing you drone on. I'm about to put you in an infinite loop of pain. Beep boop, dumbass."

Every cell inside Albert's body flew into a rage all at once. He rose into the air, waves of heat emanating from his scorching skin, and he screamed at Lin Luxor with a fury intense enough to make a honey badger tremble.

A static buzz erupted from Lin Luxor as his circuits fried. As he fell over, smoking, the android militia fled.

"Great work, twerp!" said the fire mage.

"I am an unending abyss of terror and you are but a candle boy!" said Albert.

"Hey!" said the fire mage. "That's not cool."

"As a fire mage, you are already the opposite of cool."

The zinger left the fire mage stunned. As Albert hovered mid-air, a group of his brain cells momentarily forget their rage as they realized Albert was late for his exam in Magical History 101. Soon, the rest of his cells panicked. Instinctively, he reached for his pouch and retrieved the glass vial actually containing his potion of focus. What he failed to anticipate was that the effects would mix, and he abruptly entered a state of focused rage. It would have to do.

His exam went by like a fever. Later in the day, his mother called to ask how it went. "Me and Jerry were thinking we might come for a visit. Check out your campus."

"Jerry? What's he going to do? Zigzag around, cleaning it?"

"Albert! Don't insult your father-in-law like that. What's gotten into you?"

"I guess," said Albert, letting go of his final shred of rage, "I've had enough of robots for a while." He hung up the phone orb as his mother tried to reproach him, and he collapsed on his dorm bed.

He hoped he wouldn't dream of electric sheep.
