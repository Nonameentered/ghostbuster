"Some people think magical journalism is *easy*. They don't understand it's an *art*."

Byrne suppressed the urge to club the guy to death. On the table next to him, a man and a woman seemed to be having their first date. The guy leaned forward over the table and the woman leaned back; her chair balanced on two legs. A journalist? Those were the worst types of people. They were the kind of people who'd want to expose him as a fraud.

"I report *on* magic, not *with* magic. A lot of people get that wrong." The magic journalist chuckled. His date emptied her mug in a rough swig and desperately waved to catch the attention of a barmaid.

"That's ... interesting," she said. She heroically cringed forth a smile.

Byrne scratched his chin, deep in thought. No one in this inn knew he was the legendary wizard Pahver Thryst. He had vanquished all his foes, wizards the lot of them, by bludgeoning them to death with his club. Including all witnesses, of course. Wizards are all extremely annoying. It's impossible to spend minutes with them without getting the urge to crush them to bits. They all let their beards grow down their necks and they tip their studded fedoras at every passing woman.

It was a magical journalist who gave him the name Pahver Thryst. A gaggle of wizards had been found, sploshed to bits, inside an old well. They were once the powerful group known as The Ancient Watchers. People respected them a great deal. But you know what? They called themselves that because they were peeping toms. They used their powers to sneak peeks at old women bathing. It was disgusting. Byrne caught them doing it, and he started clubbing. They zapped him with lightning and bathed him with fire, but it was so weak and pathetic that it felt like the static electricity you feel when walking across a carpet with wool socks combined with the sensation of being somewhat close to a fireplace. Club. Brains flying. Club. Bones crackling. Club club club. Guts spilling, beards unraveling; a magical display of wizardly destruction. It was nice. It made Byrne relax. You simply couldn't go wrong with clubbing some wizards to death.

"You might have heard of Pahver Thryst," said the magical journalist, and Byrne turned around with a racing heart. Had he been spotted? His cover blown? As it turned out: no. The journalist was staring at his own nails while letting his buckteeth dry in the open air.

"Power-thrust?"

The journalist let out a sarcastic clack of a laugh. "Oh, honey," he said. "No, I'm talking about the wizard, my little dear. Pahver Thryst. I came up with that name, you know. Because I have seen him in action. His magic is ... all about his hips." As he said it, he placed a hand on hers.

"Oh, wow," she said as she gently removed his hand. As a barmaid passed table with dozens of glasses of ale, she stealthily grabbed one unnoticed and sploshed it down her throat in a hurry.

"Looks like you're doing my work for me," said the journalist. He winked.

"What do you mean?"

"You're getting yourself drunk. So I don't have to. Heh, heh!"

The woman let out a groan and grimaced uncomfortably. "Hell no," she said.

"Alright," said Byrne. "I can't take it no longer. I challenge you to a duel, journalist scum."

With a plain look of the disgust, the journalist turned his head to study the man who had just insulted him. "Excuse me?" he said. "We're trying to have a date here. Ever heard of the bro code? Don't interrupt me while I'm trying to dip my quill in some ink."

"What the fuck," said the woman, softly.

Byrne groaned, but he couldn't take it any longer "You said you were the one to give Pahver Thryst his name, right?"

"Yes. That is but one of the reasons why I am of higher value than you. So maybe skedaddle, you ogre? Get lost."

"Well, I can tell you that it's not in the hips. It's all in the elbow. Allow me to demonstrate."

With one swift motion, Byrne clubbed the magical journalist into a wet, red puddle. Everyone at the inn stopped what they were doing and stared at the mushy remains of the journalist. The woman who had accompanied him, peppered with blood, said, "That's ... interesting."

Byrne held out his hand, expecting the woman to grab it.

What?" she said.

"Uh." Byrne scratched the back of his neck. "I thought I did you a favor? So maybe we could ..."

"What? You thought we'd bone it out? Are you an actual caveman? You're walking around with a literal club. What's that all about? Are you going to drag me out of here by my hair?"

"No ..."

"Wow!" cried a man in the back, frantically scribbling on a notepad. "Pahver Thryst is actually just a guy with a club! He bashes people! Bashing, bashed, bashful! Bashful Bob! That will be a great new name for you!"

Byrne made his escape. Some days later the newspaper arrived with a raven, and 'Pahver Thryst? More like Bashful Bob!' was the headline story.

He breathed a deep sigh. At least he didn't have to hide it any longer. People didn't realize the skill involved in the process. They thought clubbing people to death was easy. They didn't understand it was an ... art.
