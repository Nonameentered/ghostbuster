I fried the peanut shells in honey and watched as the smoke rose, as if in greeting, and I felt all was right in the world. No more biting necks in dark alleys. No more sleeping in cramped coffins. I was a chef, and a damned good one at that.

"Darius, how's that steak coming along?"

Swishing the pan expertly, I turned to face what I had expected to be a proud smile. Instead, there was a scowl over the face of John Hamming, star chef of The Tender Taurus. "What in god's name are you doing? Are those ... *peanuts*?"

Steam hissed around us. Other chefs-in-training, like me, stared with malice. "They are shells," I said. "Don't worry, I didn't crush them all that much. I know the texture is important for a proper steak."

John lifted his head to the skies and cried in rage. His neck throbbed with passion. "A steak!? You dare call that a steak?"

"Not enough honey?" I said, and I gave it a taste. No, it seemed about right.

"You said you trained under Gordon Ramsay."

I squinted at him. I had written my resume under the influence of blood laced with a copious amount of drugs. It was what made me decide it was time to quit. What if I were to overdose accidentally on some dude one day? When did people start walking around stuffed with all sorts of illicit substances in their blood? It was dangerous, at least to vampires like me.

"This is how he taught me," I said. "Peanut shells and honey. It's how they do it in Villefranche-sur-Mer, Provence."

John scoffed. "That's bull. You were obviously the victim of a prank. Like sending the newbie for blinker fluid at an auto shop. And Ramsay never revealed it had all been a joke? What a guy." He shook his head and let out a deep breath. "Well, I guess it's time you learned how to make a proper steak."

But I had already learned it. From my mother. Six centuries ago she made the most beautiful steaks with Valencia-peanut shells and wildflower honey. It was a treasured family recipe.

"First you get the pan nice and hot." John flung my sticky pan off the burner and into the hands of a young boy with curls who grabbed it and screamed in pain. He prepared a new one and cranked up the heat. "Now we need to crack some pepper and give this bad boy some salt."

It was a chunk of meat. No peanuts or honey in sight. It confused me greatly.

"Right. And now we add some oil. We don't do it before the pan's ready, hot and sizzling." John placed the meat-steak in the pan and gently pushed it down with his fingers. "We only flip it once," he said. "If you flip it twice, you deserve to be shot. Anyone who flips a steak more than once is a fraud and a bastard."

After three minutes of sizzling, he flipped it. "Gorgeous," he said. He added some butter. "That's how it's done. That's how you cook a steak. Go on, have a taste."

It was disgusting. I preferred my meat tartareâ€”raw and tender. Nevertheless, I had entered a new world and I would have to make adjustments. I carved a slice and I consumed it with a forced smile. Within seconds, I regretted it.

"What, rare's not good enough for you?"

It ... burned. Like the sun. "W-What kind of butter did you use?"

A cheeky grin erupted from John Hamming's delicate lips. "It's my special, little trick. I use garlic butter. It's subtle, but it gives it an extra kick."

Oh how I missed dark alleys all of a sudden. I couldn't breathe. Oh how I longed for a cramped coffin.

As I fell to the kitchen floor an image entered my mind unbidden. It was my mother, standing in the doorway, with a plate of steak. "Shells were extra crispy today," she said. "Just the way you like them." The honey glistened in the sun and as I took a bite I felt a thrill of excitement, of wonder. My mother's smile warmed me in a way that sunshine never had.

"I think Darius is allergic to garlic! Someone call for a medic! He's dying. Shit! What in god's name was he thinking, applying for a job in a kitchen?"

My mother smiled as she collapsed, starved to an almost skeletal extent. Food was her way of demonstrating her love and affection, a way to make it material. It was a love she denied herself in that time of scarcity and want.

Those steaks of peanut shells and honey were the best steaks I had ever eaten. After becoming a vampire, even blood failed to live up to that memory of my mother's cooking.

Smoke rose from my body as Hamming and his gaggle of trainees screamed and shouted over me. "A steak?" I cried, my lungs ablaze. A hushed silence fell over the kitchen, with only pots and pan clacking with bubbles and the overhead fan making noise. My uniform burst into flames. "You dare ..." I said, shouting it as if it were a curse, "You dare call that a steak?"

John Hamming's face went pale as dinner plates with horror and to my delight I heard a whimper, a confused cry, and I thought to myself that this was a fitting end.
