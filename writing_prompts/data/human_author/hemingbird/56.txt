I'm a mind reader, which means I know exactly what you're thinking. Here's a demonstration: you are now imagining your mother naked, licking an egg with the ferocity of a goose.

Why are you thinking about how weird your tongue feels in your mouth? You're thinking about how you are breathing, and now your breathing is suddenly not automatic any longer and you think it's annoying?

I'm incredible. Now, back to your mother.

I'm kidding. Wait, did you just think of her cracking the egg on her forehead? You did? You weirdo.

There's a guy sitting in front of me wearing a polo shirt and he's thinking about the girl in front of him, and she's thinking about the day she found a femur outside her house. She doesn't know it got there. And she doesn't know where it went. But I know.

Seymour Ralph picked it up and tried to sell it on Craigslist. A guy from Montana bought it. Seymour never sent it. Instead, he put it on his shelf in his room and he stares at it every time he rubs one out. He doesn't know why. I do.

But it's not because I'm a mind reader. Seymour does it for the same reason he does most things: because he's a freak.

Stop undressing your mother in your head for one second, okay? I don't care how many eggs she smashes over her body! Stop it. Please. This gift can also be a burden.

So, Seymour might be a sinner in the eyes and minds of most but he's a saint in my book. I tune everyone else out. Everyone but Seymour. He has the best daydreams.

He's thinking about an army of skeletons led by the renegade bone warrior Skull Phil. He's terrifying. He once drove his bones through a line up grandmas, and I mean *all* of his bones.

The fleshlings, as the skeletons refer to non-skeletons, are led by Cantor Ellis. He's a bone surgeon with a bone to pick and he plays the trombone better than Curtis Fuller. Two of the grandmas rampaged by Skull Phil were his. Both of them, in one fell swoop.

The skeletons and the fleshlings are at war. Europe has already fallen. And the decisive battle is nigh. There's only one problem: Cantor Ellis is currently in Maine recovering from a throat infection. His trombone had been tainted with streptococcal bacteria by skeletal minions. And Skull Phil is in New York looking to tear apart Cantor's love interest.

Seymour doesn't know how to get Cantor to New York in time. He runs through the scenario over and over, and it's killing me.

Oh, your dad has an egg too? That's ... great. No. Don't even think about imagining that. Don't do it. Don't--

My. God. What sort of freak are you? It's *dripping*, for Christ's sake.

Cantor's love interest is based on our English teacher Mrs Clark. She's the sort of teacher most of the guys in class fantasize about, and four of the girls do too. Did you know that the daydreams of girls are way more creepy than the daydreams of guys? Guys invent scenarios where women throw themselves at them. Girls invent scenarios that involve detailed planning and often a great deal of cunning. Except Susan. She always skips straight to smashing.

What really kills me about Seymour's struggles to resolve his daydream plot is that there's no reason why Cantor *has* to be in Maine. Seymour put him there because he thinks it's a wild place because he heard Stephen King grew up in Maine, which obviously gave him the material for his stories. So Seymour plopped Cantor down there and now he needs to be in New York and there's no reason why Cantor couldn't just ... live in New York.

I want to walk over there and slap him. I just might. No! I'm not talking about your dad's nuts slapping together. What's with that sound? Are you a sound engineer or something? Why is it so loud and wildly specific?

Oh, wait. Sorry. That was Susan.

But it was your dad. I, uh, don't know how they know each other.

Seymour is thinking about Skull Phil grabbing Mrs Clark by the throat. The soundtrack is actually some real Philip Glass-like material. Is that original? It's beautiful. I can see the fear in Mrs Clark's eyes and I see Skull Phil reflected in them.

An explosion. Skull Phil turns away, just for a second, and Mrs Clark rips out his femur.

Huh. I guess that's one way to deal with the situation. Mrs Clark is no damsel in distress. Oh, wait. She's now breaking the Geneva convention.

It's amazing to me that all of Seymour's daydreams pass the Bechdel test.

"My bones! My precious bones!"

She's wearing Skull Phil's rib cage like she's some kind of shield maiden.

"It seems your bones were too soft. Like your leadership."

Skull Phil stares at the fleshling with fear in his hollow eyes.

"I will change that. I will lead the skeletons into a new era."

What? Oh! Mrs Clark just tore off her skin. Turns out, there was a skeleton inside her all this time! Wait. That's normal. But it's still a disturbing image.

The plot has been resolved, and Seymour added a twist. But what about Cantor?

Oh, here he is. He's playing the trombone, tooting beautifully, and his dead companions are showing up. They're placing their hands on his shoulder. Ohh. He's dying. This is a death scene. It's immaculate. But what's this?

His dead companions have ... switchblades. I guess the ghosts are a new faction? That's ... Well, I guess he's setting up for the sequel. Seymour's got a whole franchise planned, it seems.

Mrs Clark steps into the classroom, and Seymour internally goes, "Oh no! Oh no!" He's afraid we can all see him blushing.

He's reflecting on a memory. "I believe in you, Seymour." Mrs Clark smiles in his mind. His soul swoons.

There's a skeleton inside all of us: our past. That's the structure which supports us. Oh, and your dad? Inside him there's an egg. Yes. Inside of there. You got it. Thank you.
