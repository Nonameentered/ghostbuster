I've always been the guy to say, "So what?" whenever I'm criticized. It's just an instinct by now, really. My mom once told me I was a slob, a failure of a son. "So what?" I told her. Then I told the nurse she could just pull the plug but she told me my mother was just in for a fractured toe.

A hot dog vendor got on my nerves once. He was all out of mustard. "You probably have some under there," I said.

"Under where?"

"Under your metal cart thing, down there. There's probably loads of them. Bottles of mustard and ketchup."

"I'm sorry sir," he said. "I'm all out of mustard."

I just stood there, with my naked hotdog, like an idiot. "Guess I'll just eat it then," I said, and I rolled my eyes at him. Then I tried to eat it all in one go, to make a point, and it got lodged in my throat somehow.

At first the hot dog vendor just looked around, trying to decide if he should just let me choke probably, but then a babe came walking by and he was fast to jump over the cart and give me the heimlich maneuver. He could've just walked around. It was just a simple hotdog cart. I guess he wanted to look cool.

The hotdog flew out of my throat, like an angry seagull, and the vendor laughed. "Don't try to scarf it all out at once," he said.

"So what?" I said, and I cried a little. "So what?"

That was when I realized that I should adopt a child, so strangers wouldn't have to save my life whenever I choked on hotdogs. It's embarrassing, really. It's better when it's your children. That way, they can feel as if they've really earned their inheritance. "I saved your life, pa. Give me my money." And it would be fair. It would be totally fair.

I noticed him standing at a bus stop, wearing a yellow baseball cap. They made me wear a yellow dunce hat when I was a kid, so I could relate to him right away. "Are you an orphan?" I asked him. And I kept asking him questions like that, but he wouldn't answer. Then a crazy lady appeared out of nowhere, and she beat me with her handbag. She called me a pervert, for no reason, and I just ran for my dear life. I think she'd filled her handbag with rocks.

That's when I met Lucriel. I ran right into him, knocked him over. He sighed deeply, and said, "Of course. First I get kicked out of the realms of gods and demons then someone crashes into me, just great. Jeesh."

"Huh?" I said. "Kicked out? By your parents?"

He brushed street dust off his clothes and I felt a bit bad. He didn't look hurt or anything. But it's not polite, knocking kids down like that.

"Yeah," he said. "They banished me to this mortal domain."

"Oh man."

"Now I am forced to dwell among the humans."

"That's rough."

"With neither wings nor tail."

"That's not right. That's not right at all."

We stood like that for a while, gawking at one another. Then I said, "Alright. You're my son now, and I'm your father?"

He blinked. "Just like that?"

"Just like that."

I bought us some hotdogs. Lucriel liked both ketchup and mustard on his, and it really surprised me. You have to have character, really, to have a preference like that. You don't see the world in terms of black and white, ketchup and mustard. "You're alright, kid," I said.

"I shall make the realm of the living my empire and I will lead humanity to war against gods and demons alike."

"Whoah," I said and I felt a bit embarrassed, because I'm not that ambitious. Maybe if I'd planned to take over the world when I was a kid, it would've worked out. You never know.

We had just finished our hotdogs, and luckily I didn't choke, when the sky crackled and the ground shook. Out came two people, only they weren't people really. A dude with curls and a halo over his head, and a woman with horns. It was strange.

"Mother. Father. It is too late. I will destroy the both of you."

"Lucriel," said the angel dude. "We told you no demonbox after bedtime. You can't go running off to the mortal realm whenever you get upset."

"So what?" cried Lucriel. "So what if I run away and lead the humans to war?" There were tears in his eyes.

"Lucky," said the woman with horns. "Your dad doesn't like it when you run away like that, he gets worried. Look at him. He's been crying all night."

The angel dude looked a bit embarrassed.

"Oh man," I said. "This is kind of awkward, but he's my son now. I'm his father."

"Uh," said Lucriel. "We met like half an hour ago. We just ate some hotdogs."

That little punk. "Don't disrespect your father like that," I said but the three of them just laughed at me. Then the demon woman opened a hole in the ground, hot glowing lava stuff, and she plopped herself down there with Lucriel. The angel dude shrugged, and he flew off up into the air.

"So what?" I told myself, but I didn't really feel it. "So ... what?"
