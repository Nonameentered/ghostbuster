He had an old barn owl sitting on his shoulder and every now and then he fed it a pretzel. "There you are," he'd say. "There you are, Gretta."

The man flung us an old newspaper, yellow and porous, and our captain found this to be as distasteful as the ink was faded. "What's the meaning of this?" captain Hemsdale said. "And what's with the owl?"

Coffee dripped in the background, steadily like water from a deep cavern rock. Outside pigeons cooed and the sun slunk back behind an abandoned apartment building. The stranger fed his owl another another pretzel and he said, "Read it."

Below the text was a sketch, and it bore a striking semblance to the owl-shouldered man before us. Captain Hemsdale had little patience for basket cases, though they constituted a fair share of our jurisdiction. "Relative of yours?" he said, and the man fished from his pocket a small glass vial.

"I was arrested by your colleagues more than 300 years ago for selling life-extending potions. This," he said as he clinked the vial with a pretzel. The owl watched on with a look of eager anticipation. "This is a life potion. And it works, as you can very well see." He tossed the pretzel in the air, and the owl flew at us.

"For heaven's sake!"

The man turned around to walk, and the captain yelled, "Where do you think you're going?"

Smiling, the man glanced back and he said, "I'm leaving. I just came by to flip you the bird."
