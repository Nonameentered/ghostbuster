# Part 1

Caroline had not told anyone she and Paul were trying for a child because she didn't want her friends and family to picture the two of them, accurately, rawdogging it. They deserved to be spared. Both their friends and family, and Caroline and Paul themselves.

For years they had postponed their visit to the fertility clinic because Caroline didn't want Paul to feel bad for firing blanks and Paul didn't want Caroline to feel bad for being barren. When they finally went, it turned out their fears were warranted: they were infertile. Both of them. All this time, Paul had been firing blanks across her barren landscape. The dog wasn't raw. The dog was dead.

"Do you want me to fix you a piña colada?"

"Do you have any of those fancy cocktail umbrellas?"

Paul, holding a bottle of white rum, stared at his slippers. "No."

"Then I want one."

"Oh. Sure. One world-class piña colada coming right up!"

Paul was taking a mixology class online. *Become a world-class bartender in 7 days*. It was only $17.99. Caroline had asked him what materials he got for that, and Paul said he got a 45 minute video and a dozen recipes. He also got a certificate. Caroline said she would put it on the fridge.

The woman they met with at the Henderson Fertility Center recommended hypnotherapy and acupuncture. "Have you considered adoption?"

"We looked into it. Turns out we're too poor."

"Oh. Right."

"Yeah."

It was when they left the clinic that a man rushed over to them. "Hey," he said, "I know that look. Bad news, huh?"

"I guess," Paul said.

The stranger gave them a kind smile. "There's always hope." He handed Paul a pamphlet.

"Oh. We're not really religious."

The man laughed. "It's not a religion. It's not a cult either. No, no. The Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young is legit."

"Right," said Paul. "That's really interesting. Thank you. We really appreciate it."

The stranger smiled and he left. Caroline had been impressed with how swiftly Paul had been able to deflect this crazy person.

When Paul handed her a green drink in a wine glass, the pamphlet lay before on the coffee table. "It's green," she said.

"Yes."

"I thought it would be white."

"That's a cliché. John France DuMaine says a good cocktail makes you *think*."

"Isn't it enough that it makes you *drink*?"

Paul snorted. "I'm challenging your conception."

"Conception is already a challenge to us, isn't it?" She tapped the pamphlet.

"Don't do that."

What?"

"Don't use that like some emotional dagger."

"An emotional dagger? What do you mean?"

He shrugged. "Here I am, making you a cocktail. An innovative one. And you bring that stuff up, to make me feel bad. Why?"

"I didn't say it to make you feel bad."

"Then why did you say it?"

"It was a joke."

"A joke."

"Yeah. Gallows humor. Like in that movie you like."

To his credit, he shifted gears and nodded his head thoughtfully. "In Bruges." He pointed his finger at her. "YOU are an inanimate fucking object!"

"Yes."

He guffawed, actually. "Hey," he said, "let's call the goat guy."

"Who?"

Paul picked up the pamphlet. "The Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young. There's a number. Let's call it."

Caroline froze for a second. She hadn't realized Paul was the sort of person who might call a random person out of the blue. "No. Come on. We can't do that. Let's make cocktails instead. You can make me an apple mojito in a glass mug."

Paul stopped and stared at her. He raised an eyebrow. "That's really innovative."

Taking a sip of her green piña colada Caroline slowly nodded her head. Hopefully he wouldn't call the goat guy."

"I'm calling the goat guy."

"No!"

She was forced to sit as a silent witness as Paul dialed the number. Calling a number like that ... It felt a bit like clicking on a sketchy link in an email about Viagra or millions of dollars coming your way. Caroline didn't do stuff like that, and she didn't think Paul did either. Was he secretly opening spam mails and clicking their links just for the hell of it? Was he some sort of renegade?

"Oh. Okay."

He didn't look like he was talking to a goat guy. He just looked like he was talking to some guy. Certainly not the Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young.

"Right. Uhuh. Sure. Two. Exactly. Yes."

What was the saying? Two what? Two people? Two children?

"Tonight?" he said all of a sudden. He stared at Caroline. She desperately shook her head. "Yeah I guess tonight is fine."

She wanted to scream. Instead she downed her piña colada, in preparation. In preparation of what? Of anything. Everything.

"Alright. Bye. Take care."

"What did he say? Did you just agree to something?"

Paul looked up at her from his phone. "Huh? Oh. Yeah. He's coming over."

"Who's coming over?"

"The goat guy."

This time, Caroline did scream.
