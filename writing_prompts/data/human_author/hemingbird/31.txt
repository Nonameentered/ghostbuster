All those years spent in my mother's basement, sweating and crying and shouting into that dark abyss of the soul: they had all been worth it. Finally my destiny had been fulfilled. I had become a sword.

"M'lord?"

Kaitengard brushed his majestic beard, entranced by the very sight of me. "This sword ... the warlock has cursed it!"

The warlock, understandably, looked stumped. "What? No. I didn't do anything. When you swung that sword around, boy, I thought I was a goner. But, uh. Here I am. Your sword was already ... human."

"Yup," I said. "I've not been talking much. Sorry about that. That's my social anxiety. People always used to say, 'You're not saying anything, Gareth' and that's the worst thing you can say to someone with social anxiety."

"W-What's the meaning of this?" Kaitengard said, and he threw me to the ground.

"Ow! What're you doing, you sussy baka?"

"... What?"

Kaitengard and the warlock stared at each other. Of course. Awkward silence. That was why I didn't want to say anything in the first place. It was always like that in school. People would be talking, then I'd say something, and it'd get all quiet. I hated that. "Come on, m'lord. Pick me up. I love it when we slice people."

"This really was not your doing?" Kaitengard said.

"I'm afraid not," said the warlock. "Your sword ... it was already a dweeb."

"No! I'm not a dweeb! I'm a sword! I was reincarnated as a sword because I died as a virgin, probably. Don't leave me. Not like this."

But it was too late. Both Kaitengard and the warlock had left me. I would have shed tears, if I could. Some words truly cut deeper than any blade.
