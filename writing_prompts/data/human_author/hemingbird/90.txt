Mother Hare held her lifeless child like the Pi√©ta as a cloud of anger seemed to rise from her, crackling with thunder. "Mr Achilles," said Mother Hare. "The world must learn the truth. There was a lifetime of hops and leaps left in my boy, and now he is dead. You cannot let Tortoise get away with this. You cannot."

Detective Achilles let out a puff of smoke. The sight was not a pleasant one. Hare had a legendary racer, known throughout the animal kingdom for his speed. No one believed a mere tortoise could prove a challenge to him, and most dismissed early reports of his victory as mere rumors. Then it dawned on them that it was true. Tortoise had won. He had won the race. At least that was truth, as it had been established.

"We'll get to the bottom of this," said Achilles. "I know a man who might be of some help."

As Achilles knocked on the man's door, he thought of that old myth of the earth being held up by a turtle. The turtle was held up by yet another turtle and so on until infinity. What was that word even supposed to mean? 'Infinity'. Something stretched out beyond comprehension, and further. It made little sense.

"Ah! Achilles! Just the man I wanted to see."

"Zeno. You look well. Have you been expecting me?"

"All of Elea has been expecting you," replied Zeno. "Ever since that race, people have been talking. A hare? Well, perhaps a tortoise can defeat a hare, but the great Achilles? There's no chance."

Achilles laughed. "My days of racing are over, Zeno. Only my mind persist in that endeavor, as I'm working cases. And it just so happens that the one I'm working right now is all about that tortoise."

As he explained, a sly grin formed slowly on the lips of Zeno. Achilles could tell that he was up to something. "Any thoughts?" he said.

"An arrow," said Zeno.

"Pardon?"

Zeno excused himself for a moment and arrived back at the doorstep with a bow and an arrow. He drew it and pointed it at some bushes.

"Imagine an arrow frozen in an instant of time. At the instant, the arrow is not moving. And in the next frozen moment? It is not moving then either. In fact, there is no instant of time in which the arrow moves. Yet ..." With that, Zeno released his grip and the arrow swooshed into the bushes. "... It moves."

"Eek!"

A man ran out from the bushes, clenching his buttocks. His left cheek carried Zeno's arrow.

"And it keeps on moving," said Achilles thoughtfully.

"Ahem," said Zeno. "Well, my point was more that it's a paradox."

"A paradox?"

"Yes. Conflicting facts. A breakdown of logic. Somewhere along the line, there's a flawed assumption. That's the basis for any paradox. Let's say that you *do* race the tortoise. You give him a slight head start. He is, after all, a tortoise. What happens when you try catching up to him?"

"I run past him. Easily."

"Not so fast, my dear Achilles. First you have to go half the distance between the two of you. And you will have halved the distance, yes?"

"... I suppose," said Achilles.

"Then you halve *that*. And you keep halving the distance in that fashion, and so a paradox arises. You can keep halving the distance forever. Which means you can never catch up to him. You will have lost the race."

A shiver went down Achilles's spine. He could lose to a mere tortoise? "But I'm *faster*," he objected. "You said something about flawed assumptions earlier."

"Yes," said Zeno, stroking his white beard. "The flawed assumption is that time is a thing that can be divided into bits and pieces. That is only possible in our minds. In reality ..."

"I win the race."

"One would assume," said Zeno with a playful smile.

Achilles understood the lesson his friend had wanted to impart. And he knew just what to do, though it would be challenging. Tortoise had leveraged his victory as a path into politics. His party of Slow and Steady promoted conservatism and fiscal responsibility, and his campaign kept on referencing his legendary race as a demonstration of the truth of his principles. Tortoise had grown to become a powerful animal, with powerful connections. Bringing him down wouldn't be easy.

But first he would have to lure him out from his shell.
