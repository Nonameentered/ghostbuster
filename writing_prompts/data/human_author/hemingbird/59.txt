Andy Timbo stared up at his screen; fluorescent he softly chewed his gums and breathed out a sigh of relief: he had crafted the perfect prompt. His children would not go hungry tonight. They would be fed, lobsters or swans or whatever they may wish; this prompt would be the seed of their newfound happiness.

The idea had come to him at night. For days he had let it sit. It was a stew the ingredients of which were flashes of neural activity and biochemicals flowing rich in synapses. The letters in Star Wars. The ones gliding across the screen at the opening. What if, in-universe, these were ... real?

A swift sweep of a selection of search engines confirmed it: the idea was original. His alone and no one else's. At least for a while. For he would share it with the world, and he would bask in its brilliance. And then? Then he would feast.

The yellow letters morphed into dollar signs in his mind palace. Yellow letters. His bliss, his fortune, his fame; it would all be thanks to the yellow letters.

No sooner than he had posted the prompt, there was a knock at his door. Annoyed to be potentially robbed of the chance to be the first to upvote the first reply, he lifted his gracious rear from his seat and went to answer whatever salesman had been stupid enough to disturb him. Imagine his shock, then, when he opened the door to see not a man, but a letter. A yellow letter. E hovered before him, throbbing with cosmic energy, and beside it stood P. He let a gasp escape his lungs and then there was darkness.

Timbo felt, for a moment, that he was back in the cradle. Unicorns danced in a carousel above and he stretched out his tiny hands but they were too far off. A burst of light stole his sight, and the light was yellow. Howling the howl of mad men he saw before him, illuminating the dead void of space, the entire EPISODE. And by its side? The 1.

There would be no lobsters nor any swans for Andy Timbo's hungry children. Their father drifted in space, haunted by yellow letters releasing a ghastly glow of ill spirit. He felt his very essence grow dim. Empty. And it was there, bereft of hope, The Phantom Menace made its appearance.

A successful prompt. Had it been too much to ask? Had he truly taken on the role of Icarus in this Greek play of life? Alas; he could not even be said to have flown too close to the sun for the sun was nowhere to be seen. There was only the letters, in their yellow glare, and Andy Timbo said a silent prayer before he let a stray thought--a flash of activity in a bath of synaptic biochemicals--be his last.

He thought of result number 17 that emerged when he Bing'd his idea and the horror he had ushered away from his waking mind: someone else had thought of it first. He had not wanted to know. Had not let himself know. But now, at the cusp of the end, it was all he knew.

He thought not of the seed and the glorious tree he had hoped would grow from it for he had no more time. The yellow letters had won. Andy Timbo, consumed by his perishing thought, cursed his self-afflicted ignorance.

"There is no ignorance."

A voice in the dark.

"There is knowledge."

A blue line spread across the letters and yellow they split in half. Cosmic guts, buzzing, flew from them. Andy Timbo turned to see what he had forgotten. The last part of his prompt: the Jedi. Tears filled his eyes.

"There is no emotion," said the Jedi. "There is *peace*."

Breaking from the yellow-lettered vortex, Andy Timbo gasped with the recognition that he was home. He was back. Quickly, he tapped his body to make sure everything was in its right place. He breathed out a sigh of relief. He had escaped. The Jedi had saved him and he had escaped.

The first thing he did was to check the comment section of his prompt and his response was immediate:
