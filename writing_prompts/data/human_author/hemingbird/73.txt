Call me Amy Lee, because I'm Going Under.

No, actually call me Elena. That's my name. I just wanted to entice you into hearing my cusp-of-anesthetic-sleep story with a little joke. I tell jokes when I'm nervous. And I'm very nervous.

Ever since I was a little girl, I've had a voice in my head. I'm not talking about mundane inner dialogue. No, I'm talking about a different voice. A man's voice, at that. Gentleman Perry. That's what he likes to call himself.

He first arrived on my fifth birthday. I can remember thinking that he was a guest, hiding from me for some unknown purpose. "Lady Elena! I am gentleman Perry. Please do not be alarmed. I mean you no harm."

"Where are you? I can't see you?"

I looked everywhere. My parents had blown way past their budget for my presents, so they were a bit disappointed that I spent the entire party searching for what they assumed to be an an invisible friend.

Gentleman Perry helped me stand up to bullies on the playground. "Kick them in the groin, Elena, and they will never bother you again!"

He helped me out when I couldn't decide on a major in college. "Listen to your mind, and you will have a comfortable life. Listen to your heart, and you will have one worth living."

He even helped me navigate a very messy divorce. "I never liked Bret. What an ass! You are much better off, lady Elena. I promise that you will soon see you did the right thing."

Gentleman Perry was right. I should never have married a guy with a name like 'Bret'. Obviously it would only result in disaster.

And speaking of disasters.

One day, about a year ago, I had an episode. The world turned green. Then it turned red. Then I tried telling a friend something strange was going on, and she said, "Blubba? Blubb blubb blub-blub?" Only she didn't say that. That was just what I heard. Something had gone wrong with my brain, and it wouldn't be the first time.

A litany of doctor's visits. I've seen so many charts by now that they pop up in my head all the time. I see pie charts of my everyday budget for every purchase, however minor. Histograms rise and fall along with every slight shift in temperature. Once I even saw a scatter plot of Daily Moments of False Hope over time. It looked something like The Great Wave Off Kanagawa.

I had a tumor in my brain, pressing up against poor pieces of gray matter like a 40-year-old man at a late-night disco.

"But Elena!" you might cry. "Anesthesia isn't used for brain operation. It can't feel pain. And surgeons want you awake so that they know they're not slicing off something important."

First of all: the brain is the *only* organ that can feel pain.

Second: I insisted, and they caved in.

Without the surgery, I'm a goner for sure. Not that it has a high probability of success, but 'something' beats 'nothing' in the old Hope Department. So when I demanded anesthesia there was some intense back and forth but in the end I got what I wanted. And why was I so insistent? Because Gentleman Perry tells me that when they remove the tumor, they'll remove him as well. For good.

It was in the early stages of terror that he confided in me. "Lady Elena, there's something important I must discuss with you."

Gentleman Perry told me that he had come to a discovery: he was a tumor. At first he didn't believe it, but the signs were all there. He had grown up with me, and he had become a person in his own right. But he was living in someone else's house. He was squatting in my brain, and this made him deeply uncomfortable.

The anesthesia is not for me. It's for him. It's so that when they cut up him with scalpels, he doesn't have to live through the horror of being dissected bit by bit.

"I have cherished our time together, lady Elena," Gentleman Perry says.

Me too, Perry.

Me too.
