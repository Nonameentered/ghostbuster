The world's scuffed.

The big-brained CEO of Pepe Pharmaceuticals, Maggs, huffs the last traces of Copium from his inhaler. "The board's not going to like this. They're gonna be hella mad."

"It's all going to work out," says Monicah, writhing about on the floor. "It always does." Right next to her is one last canister of Hopium. Empty.

For a while, they were the biggest tech company out there. They branched out into pharmaceuticals when it became clear that their customers consumed their products mainly because they needed an escape from the grim reality of their daily existence in a collapsing world. They ground the brains of their top streamers into a pulp, figuratively. They distilled their essence. They discovered it could be imitated with a compound similar to oxytocin and vasopressin, neuropeptides involved with social bonding. There was also a trace of serotonin to it, enough to activate a subset of key receptors. Copium and Hopium gave their consumers the relief they needed. Then it all went monkaS.

"Hope is that thing with feathers," says Monicah.

"Emily D," says Maggs. "Gotta love Emily D."

They barely seem to notice me, hovering around like a ghost. Were they even aware that I'd come to save them?

"There's a solution."

Their ears perk up. "What's that?" Maggs rubs his eyes.

I point to the Powerpoint presentation. AURELIUM BLUE. It's such a cool name.

"We're all out of Copium," says Maggs.

"We're all out of Hopium," says Monicah.

I can see it written all over their faces. They're lost in the wilderness of being. Perfect.

"That's fine. What I'm pitching is better. It's tried and true."

"Aurelium Blue," says Maggs. "What's that mean?"

"Aurelium is inspired by Marcus Aurelius, the stoic emperor. And the word 'blue' makes people think of calm things like the sky and the ocean."

Monicah squints. "But what is it? How can it be better than Copium and Hopium?"

I shrug, in a way I practiced in the mirror earlier. "Maybe it isn't. But it works."

"The board's going to bust my ass," says Maggs, and he's sweating. "I'm willing to try anything."

"Aurelium Blue is just a standard antidepressant. But it's got a cool name."

"Huh?" says Maggs. "That's it?"

"Yup. Old stuff. New name."

Monicah nods her head. "Aurelium Blue. I like it."

"The stoic philosophy is about ignoring problems outside your control. And that's how conventional antidepressants work. They are like filters, limiting your emotional range such that you don't get too upset. You soldier on. And you keep consuming. At the end of the day, isn't that what we're truly after? Blithe consumers. Deferential zombies. It's the beauty of capitalism."

Maggs cheers. "That's it! It's an uninspired spin on something old, like a low-risk movie sequel. It's perfect."

"The pills are blue, of course. Wouldn't *The Matrix* have been much improved if Neo went for the blue pill instead? Blissful ignorance is strength."

"I like Keanu Reeves," says Monicah.

I smile. "And *The Matrix* turned into a franchise. It started out as a movie about breaking free from the system, then it turned into something much better: a tribute to the system itself. You take something old, and you dress it up so that it looks new. That's a beautiful thing. *The Matrix Revolutions* was the best one in the series. It told the viewer, 'you're hooked now and you're going to keep coming back for more and it doesn't matter if it's good or not--you just want to feel the nostalgia of something safe and familiar'. It's the perfect message."

I give Maggs and Monicah a blue pill each. "Take the pill and the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. That's what life really is all about. That's what you want. That's what your customers want, deep down."

Maggs and Monicah pop their pills, their Aurelium Blues, and they smile.

This is how it must be. We must keep calm and carry on as if everything's alright, as if the planet's not dying. It doesn't matter what we do, honestly, so we might as consume our last time on earth like deferential zombies, blissful and blithe.

The world's scuffed. But if we all just put our heads together, we can have a great time consuming the remains of its rotting corpse.
