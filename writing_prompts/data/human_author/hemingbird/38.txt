The turquoise blob of incandescent matter rose from the portal like angry steam and said, "Fools! You are not prepared!"

Billy picked at his nose. From the look in his eyes I knew what was about to unfold. He dug deep, like Rocky Balboa in a second-act Moment of Crisis, and his finger slicked out his nose with a thick gob of green gold. Billy smirked. The monster in front of us, the ineffable blob, never saw it coming. Oh, how many nights Billy had spent practicing. We had been nothing but targets to him, something to aim for before the true ordeal would present itself in all its glory. Billy gently placed his booger on the tip of his thumb and he *flicked*.

It broke the sound barrier with a roar. A booger threatening to tear a hole in spacetime, a booger set ablaze as it rushed through the air toward the creature frothing with unearned hubris.

An explosion. No, scratch that: an *implosion*. When the booger made impact, the blob shriveled up into nothingness, blipped out of existence. Billy really knew how to flick a booger.

"It seems you were the one who failed to prepare," said Billy and we were smacked into silence with awe, with trepidation.

The portal zorped shut. Apparently, the monsters decided they would not be invading the realm of humans today. Not with a kid like Billy on the loose. Not with his finger hovering close to his nasal trigger, as it always remained.

"Billy! That's not how we dispose of demonic creatures. What were you thinking?"

Our Scoutmaster stood frowning with his hands on his hips and I watched as the color drained from his face and it went pale with horror like a squid instantly turning white when killed. For Billy had just put his finger back into his nose.
