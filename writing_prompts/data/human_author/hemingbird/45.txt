My childhood memory was not, as it turns out, of fire and brimstone but of old, rotten eggs in my mother's pantry.

People in Colorado are igneous, set in their ways and cold and unfriendly. When I returned to my forgotten homeland I met a farmer and his wife, and I asked them if they wouldn't mind it if I ate their cat. They wouldn't let me! I even asked them again, nicely, and still they refused me this simple request.

My mother dragged me to the Boulder Pearl Street Mall and she pointed out to me the place where I was conceived, "Right there, by the tulips. Of course there weren't any tulips then. There was just me and your father and a marching band playing down the road. To this day the glockenspiel never fails to give me a frisson."

In Boulder they ride bikes like mad, because they hate themselves and there's no torture as effective as riding a bicycle. I sneered at a pedaller and to my delight he veered and crashed into a pole. "That's right," my mother said and she sighed. "You were always like that."

I told my mother about the old farmer and his wife, and how they wouldn't let me eat their pet. "Oh, there are no pets in Boulder," she said. "We are pet guardians, you see, for the pets own themselves."

I vomited all over the Pearl Street Mall. My mother shouted obscenities and she grabbed my collar and off we went.

"Why did you give up on me?" I asked and my mother blinked, then half-laughed, then blinked some more.

"We never gave up on you, dear. You ran off. We bankrupted ourselves trying to find you."

"That's not true. I would remember a thing like that."

"Do you remember the pelican?"

I did not remember the pelican. She described it to me, a childhood toy tied to a string dangling from the roof. I reached for it as if it might save me from terrible pain and she took me one day to the Boulder Ridge Wild Animal Park and they had no pelicans and I screamed and I kept screaming for days and I ripped the pelican from its string and I stepped on it over and over, crushing it, then I grieved the precious bird and my tears ran down my cheeks like the blood from the corners of your mouth when you eat a stupid cat.

"I always believed you went off in search of pelicans," she told me and she offered me a cigarette.

"I don't smoke."

"But you're a demon."

"Not all demons smoke cigarettes, mom."

She smiled, then wailed. The cigarette fell from her mouth. "What's wrong?"

"You called me 'mom'," she sobbed and I rolled my eyes but as I rolled them they betrayed me and I started crying as well and there we were, one son stinking of vomit and one mother stinking of tobacco and we both cried.

"I really want to eat a cat," I said and sniffled.

"I know you do, but we don't do that here."

"Maybe I'll eat a biker."

"Maybe you'll eat a pelican."

And I remembered, suddenly, the pelican drifting above. Its beak, open. It had teeth. Grinning as if it knew a special secret. As if in its beak it held some treasure. I felt a yearning. Kinship. For I also had a secret, and my secret also made me grin.

"Do you love me even though I am a demon?"

"A mother loves her children especially much if they are demons," she said.

We sat in the open air, waiting for no thing in particular. A cat walked past, black and slim, and I grumbled. "Hello, sir," I said and he meowed politely in return.

"Sir Pelican!" said my mother and she clapped her wrinkled, veiny hands together. "We will get a cat, and we will name it Sir Pelican."

"Why?"

"I don't think you would eat a cat with a name like that."

"I might."

"Sir Pelican," she repeated softly.

The cat stared at us from a distance. I waved at it. "I might eat Sir Pelican."

"I don't think you will," she said. "I don't think you will."
