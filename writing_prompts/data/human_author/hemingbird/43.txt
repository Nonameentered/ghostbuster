**The Usual Reasons**

You never expect to murder yourself.

The mother of Romanian philosopher Emil Cioran said if she knew how miserable he would have turned out, she would have aborted him. Cioran wrote books with titles such as *The Trouble With Being Born* and *On the Heights of Despair*. If there were an award for misery I am sure he would have unhappily accepted it. Yet not even he would have imagined doing a thing like this.

I am not talking about such a simple thing as the act of taking one's own life. I say 'simple', but Albert Camus said it was the essential philosophical question. Whether to be, or not to be. No, I am talking about murder. The murder of yourself. It is infinitely more complicated, because you have to live with its ramifications.

He arrived while I was taking a bath. Otis Redding's *(Sittin' On) the Dock of the Bay* played from my bluetooth speaker and I was enjoying, for the very first time in a bath, an imperial stout. They tend to have Russian names, and the one I drank was no different: Smerdyakov. I bought it because I was impressed with the brewery for daring to name their beer after one of the most loathsome characters in the history of fiction. If they wanted something from Dostoevsky they could have gone for Raskolnikov instead. Perhaps they just liked the sound of the name. It was possible none of them had ever read *The Brothers Karamazov*.

My bath was interrupted by an arrhythmic knock on my door, unpredictable like drops of water. I let out a sigh and considered ignoring them, whoever they were. A person who knocks like that cannot be sane. But curiosity got the better of me. I paused Redding and I put Smerdyakov aside. Wrapped in a towel, I walked to the door in no hurry.

The knocking persisted until I opened the door. And when I did, my first thought was that I must have fallen asleep in my bath.

"I'm sorry," he said. "I know this must come as a bit of a shock."

That was an understatement. The man who stood in my doorway looked exactly like me, if I had been caged and starved for a year or so.  Haggard, he scratched his patchy beard (mine was full) and he held out his hands with a concerned look on his face.

"I wouldn't have come if it wasn't important. May I come inside?"

I let him inside and I offered him a beer. He asked me if I had something stronger, and I fetched a bottle of fernet from my cabinet.

"Sorry," I said. "That's the best I can do."

He scratched the back of his head. "Do you mind if I drink from the bottle?"

I told him it was fine. He unscrewed the bottle with shivering hands and with a trained motion he gave it a long swig.

"Ah. That hits just right. Do we have this in my timeline?"

"Your timeline? I assumed you were some long lost twin."

"Sorry, it was a rhetorical question. Or, no. It was an anti-rhetorical question." He smiled at me with blackened teeth. "I am like that. I say things like that. What about you? Is that something we have in common?"

I felt disappointed looking at this cracked-mirror reflection of myself. "No, I don't think so. Were you being serious? About you having come from a different timeline?"

He took a deep breath. "It's true. I escaped mine. It's not so different from this one. The only difference I have noticed so far is that in our timeline the air tastes a bit different. Somewhat like honey. I never noticed it before I came here. I never noticed it before it became an absence."

For a while we sat in silence. He kept drinking and every so often he would look up at me with a grin, as if ready to tell a joke, then he'd catch himself and his lips would tighten.

"Why did you come here?"

"Oh, for the usual reason."

"There are usual reasons?"

"Of course," he said. "Dimension hopping is a risky affair. It could kill you. In fact, it's more likely that it kills than you successfully ending up safe on the other side. So it's rarely done. Who'd want to do a thing like that?"

He sipped on the fernet and looked at me in a way that made me think he expected me to have the answer. "Wait. You said the air was the only difference you noticed, but surely our lack of dimension-hopping technology indicates that that can't be true."

My strange clone grinned. "But you do," he said. "Otherwise I could not have come here. You need portals on both sides."

I did not know whether to believe him. It was more likely that he were a lost twin who for some reason or the other decided to play a prank with me on our first meeting.

"Aren't you going to ask me?"

"Sorry?"

"About my reason for coming."

My stomach groaned. I asked him if he were hungry and he told me not to bother. Then he changed his mind and said he would gladly eat, because if he didn't his last meal would be a pack of uncooked noodles.

"Your last meal?"

"Yes. I have come here to ask you to kill me."

We ate some leftover lasagna and a green salad and shared a bottle of red wine. My doppelgänger explained that he had had an encounter similar to mine a year before. A clone appeared at his home and they had a disagreement. He ended up striking a blow to his head, and he died. In his pocket was a business card with a phone number on it, and to the surprise of my clone it turned out to lead to an organization specializing in interdimensional travel. He would not give all that many details, but cautioned me that reaching out to them would do me no good. "It's a one-way ticket. They made me sign some documents, had me hand over all my material possessions. Dealing with people like me is only a very small part of what they do. You don't want to think too deeply about the rest."

"What about the body?"

"What?"

"You said you killed your clone."

He munched on a lettuce leaf, then took a long sip of his wine. "I just left him there. What else?"

I had not considered how it would appear. No one would suspect that the body was not his.

"Well, I'm sorry but I'm not going to do a thing like that."

He stopped. Looked at me with an ominous expression. "How well do you think you know yourself?"

In his hand he held his fork and he studied it carefully.

"To be honest, it's pretty obvious that you're just messing with me. I never knew I had a twin. I'm not sure why you chose such a strange story, but it was entertaining. You can drop the act now."

Instead of responding, he stabbed my hand. Blood gushed from a punctured vein and I quickly pulled it to my chest and applied pressure. "What are you doing?" I shouted.

"It's a nice apartment," he said. "Maybe your life is more worth living than mine. I changed my mind. You don't have to kill me. Instead I'll kill you, okay?"

His eyes lit up and he laughed. "That story I told you was true. I really did meet a version of myself from a different dimension and I really did kill him. But what he didn't know was that it wasn't my original dimension."

I paced backward and crashed into the wall, keeping my eyes on him as he casually strolled to my kitchen and inspected several knives before finding one he liked. "Don't do this," I said. "Please."

"I'm a gambler," he said. "Interdimensional Russian roulette is my favorite game. And do you know what I realized? If there are infinite versions of myself, there must be an infinite number of them playing the same game as me. Isn't that interesting?"

I made a run for the door, but he was faster. My lung made a popping sound when the blade ran through my shoulder and I gasped for breath.

"Man conquers the world by conquering himself," he said. "That's from one of the old Romans, I think. Some Stoic. Appropriate, isn't it?"

I fell to the floor as pink bubbles formed around my mouth.

And then I died. My doppelgänger chopped me up into little bits and fed them to gulls over the span of a few months. He kept my parts in the freezer and brought them outside bit by bit.

"Wait," you might say. "How can you be telling this story?"

You have not realized by now? I tricked you. I told you the story from the opposite point of view. I have a rich experience in assuming the identity of alternative versions of myself. And the story is mine now. This point of view is mine. So perhaps I have not been dishonest with you. I truly did listen to Otis Redding and I truly did drink an imperial stout with the name Smerdyakov. I found the evidence in the bathroom. But I had to make up the details because I never discussed it with my doppelgänger.

Taking the perspective of others is a valuable exercise. And I am quite good at it.

I will remain here, at least for some time. I might get bored. If I am lucky, I will have another visitor. And if he comes, I can be certain that he will do so for the usual reasons.
