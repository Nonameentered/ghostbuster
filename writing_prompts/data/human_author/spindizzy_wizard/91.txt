Someone *is* calling, but the voice.  There is such pain.  The being stands within the glacier, stretching a lithe body as if rising from a long slumber.

It rises through the ice that is its home and wafts into the wind.  What a wind it is!  She... Yes, she!  Dances on the wind, swirling from one snowflake to another, reveling in their unique features.

••• 

"Eisjungfrau!"

••• 

The voice!  It sounds distressed.  Curious, she moves to the sound, swirling in her dance with the snowflakes that came to dance with her.

••• 

I am dying.  I cannot feel my feet anymore, and my hands are going numb.  It's the wind.  It steals my heat faster than my body can produce it.

I'm not going to give up, even if I am at one-half mountain speed.

Step, six breaths, ... "Eisjungfrau!"  It doesn't hurt anymore.  I know that is a bad sign, but the relief from pain is too great for me to care.

••• 

A human?  Here?  Why?

••• 

Why did I try to climb the mountain?

To share the view with the spirits, and maybe... Just maybe... Touch the sky.

••• 

It is dying.  Why is it dying?

••• 

I do not know why I was talking, or to whom, unless...
 
"Hello.  I'm Sam."  I'm also delusional from lack of food, water, and freezing to death.  "Are you Eisjungfrau?"

••• 

He is speaking to me!  No one has spoken to me for centuries.  As I circle him, I gather the wind to me.  My friends, the snowflakes, are happy to see me again.

••• 

Where did the wind go?  The relief is palpable.  I stop.  Another mistake.

••• 

I think... Yes.  I will aid this one.

••• 

I'm either dead or close to it because I'm standing in the middle of an igloo Just being out of the wind completely was a relief.  Now there is dead air insulating me from the cold outside.

Slowly, so slowly, my mind begins to function again.  I slip out of my pack and pull the candle stove from it.  It will give me light, heat, and a chance at a hot drink.  I remember something.  Yes, I owe it thanks.

•••

He stopped calling me.  Is he dead?  No, he moves.  Has he forgotten me already?

••• 

"Danke, Eisjungfrau.  Danke."

(I choose to reveal myself to this one.  It is an effort; he only half believes.)

A vision forms as I fumble with the candle stove.  A young lady.  Alabaster skin, with a translucent look to it.  Pale blond hair and eyes so pale blue it almost hurts to look at them.

When I light the first candle, her body becomes brilliant displays of prismatic color.  I sit dumbfounded until a word floats to the top of my mind.

"Schön... Eisjungfrau ist Schön."

(I smile at the compliment.  He begins to speak, telling me of his life, and praising mine.  I am captivated.)

•••

I don't remember what I said, only the look on her face.  Serene and beautiful.  Her eyes became more animated the longer I talked.  The igloo warmed enough that I was sure I would survive, so I went to put out the candle stove.  I'd had my hot drink and was in a much better state.  I did not want to cause harm to her, but when I reached for the candle, she interposed her hand.  So, I left the candle burning.

It was well I did.  Just after midnight, the temperature plummeted.  I must have spent the whole night talking with her.

••• 

"Papa?  The hostel called.  His beacon is no longer reporting.  They will send a team in the morning.   Papa?  They do not sound confident."

"And well they should not.  Such storms kill.  There has not been a survivor in my memory."

"Then there is no hope?"

"There is always hope. The Ice Maiden may intercede on his behalf."

"Oh, Papa, how can you believe in such things?"

"In my youth, I too climbed mountains."

••• 

"HALOO!"

I waken to the calling of voices.  They do not sound far.

"Here!  I am Here!"  I struggle to find the opening but find it I do, and crawl out into such brightness that I am nearly blind.  Standing, I call out again.  "Here!  I am Here!"

A cheer from the search party goes up, and they gather around me.  I am quickly checked and bundled up.  Others gather my kit, marveling at my ability to construct such an igloo in the middle of a raging storm.

"I built no igloo."

"Then who did?"

I smile, "Eisjungfrau."

•••

The news from the hostel is welcome, and his granddaughter stares at him.  "How did you know?" she asks.

He smiles and takes in her features.  A Heart-shaped face, pale clear skin, light blond hair, and beautiful pale blue eyes so sharp you could cut yourself on them.  "In my youth, I too climbed mountains."
