"Forgive me, but I need a philosophical discussion of your current mode of existence.  For instance, what is the last thing you remember before you started talking to people through this mirror?"

"What quality are you attempting to define?"

"I'd rather state the problem I am facing.  Let's say I have far more advanced information than yours, not because I'm more intelligent, but because I am from your future.  Would that information disrupt the world?"

"A pretty problem.  The results hinge on my actual state of being, thus your polite attempt to ascertain if I am deceased."

"The last things I remember are that Alexander is dead, and I have left Athens due to politics.  We are some distance north of the city."

"I'm sorry."

"Then I am dead?"

"Those are the circumstances of your death."

"I see.  May I have some time alone?"

"Certainly, I will attempt calling you again in 24 hours."

"Until then."

"Herpyllis!  We go south!"

"But north..."

"I know, but I also know I'll die if I go north.  South is at least a chance."

THIS HAS BEEN A DRAMATIZATION OF THE RIP IN TIME.  WHICH TIME YOU EXPERIENCE FROM THIS POINT FORWARD IS UNKNOWN TO US.
