Now we proceed to one of the more remarkable cases.  The Waterbear, more correctly known as the Tardigrade, is a microscopic life form from Earth.  Yes, the same Earth that humans come from.  However, the particular species of Tardigrade is referred to as Neutronicus Colonia Tardigrade.

A sloppy survey crew examined a world about to fall into the lethal range of a spinning neutron star.  It would be irradiated repeatedly as the beams from the star swept the planet.

The survey crew was tasked with exposing several different species to those environs at a variety of depths.

While the surface was obviously uninhabitable, the subsurface was a bonanza of rare minerals, eutectic alloys, and pure metals refined over time as the planet cooled in the effects of the beams.  Over time, all volatiles had burned off, leaving a nearly sterile environment.

And here, sloppy maintenance, a distraction of medium proportions, and a monumental time crunch led to an unprecedented contamination event, fortunately after the scheduled tests.

On the other hand, that contamination resulted from dumping the entire raw recycling sequence into the hole dug for the test series.  In which the samples were still located.  They'd gotten samples by remote but had planned to run subsequent tests.  Unfortunately, the engineering casualty caused them to cut their stay short, leaving just before the next sweep of the beams.

The survey crew *assumed* that the contamination would be sterilized, and for 99.999% of the test species, that's precisely what happened.

Except for the Tardigrades.

In the constant sweep of the beam, the tardigrades mutated.  A complex process for them, as they carry a unique defense against genetic damage, making them highly resistant to the effects of radiation.  Easily surviving exposures a hundred to a thousand times stronger than their nearest competitor, the notorious roach also from Earth.

Over time, the tardigrades developed simple cell structures on a macroscopic scale.  The outer layer would hibernate, protecting the inner layers from cold and vacuum.  They also developed a genetic response to the void that caused layers of tardigrades to peel off and seal leaks, preserving the remaining volatiles they needed to survive.

This colony form of tardigrade subsumed features of fungi that were also part of the tests, giving them the enzymes to dissolve nearly any organic material for sustenance and structure.

The next ship to arrive discovered the organism the hard way.  A freak failure in decon let a microscopic sample of the tardigrade colony into the ship.  On a fortunate chance, that sample found its way to a laboratory mouse.  The mouse survived, but was obviously contaminated.  Imagine the scientist's confusion when the mouse survived:  Exposure to vacuum for twenty four hours; temperatures close to absolute zero, as well as extended exposure to temperatures in excess of 2000 CÂ° 

Can you guess what happened?  Yes, that's right.  They were *refining* the colony.  Making it stronger and more capable.  Finding themselves unable to properly dispose of the specimen, and desiring proof of what they had seen, they decided to seal the specimen inside a transparent ring carbon composite.  They left it in the isolation box in the bio lab.  Ordinarily, the safest place for any suspicious sample.

In this case, it left the colony wrapped in volatiles with a source of energy; when occupied, the isolation box remains illuminated and recorded.

That is the only reason we have any idea what happened.  The entire crew were assimilated.  When the ship dropped out at the next port, it immediately transmitted the biohazard warning with crew surviving.  The ship systems sensed crew moving around because of the ID implants.  Yet the life sensors registered slow movement and unusual body temperatures.

When the rescuers tapped the internal cameras, what they saw confounded them.  Slightly larger than human figures, coated in a dense grey matter,  shambling from one place to another, their arms outstretched before them.

The humans have a word for this state, although, in some ways, this is far more gruesome: Zombies.

The usual methods for dealing with contagion were bypassed and they went straight for termination.  In an amazing demonstration of procedure, they replicated the tests the scientists performed, further refining the colony.

In the end, they sent in the Marines.  Power armored troops with weapons heavy enough to destroy main battle tanks.

Simple kinetic rounds did no apparent damage.  HEAP, APDSAT, all the various possible combinations were tried with uniformly disappointing results.

What would they try next?

Yes.  Energy weapons.  Laser first, finally ending with an Easer/Plasma cannon.  That particular combination, an electron beam making a pathway for a plasma burst, finally got a desireable result.  It was the influx of energy.  The colony placed all living beings into stasis when there was not enough energy to support full life.  The colony then rambled about, looking for the intense radiation of the neutron star.  The energy from that weapon allowed the colony to revive the human component, who could then communicate with the Marines.  After a fashion.

When they needed more energy they would go to the airlock and wave their hands at the Marines.  That would usually draw a shot, which left them able to operate, transmitting their findings to the Council of Science.

In time, the Marines were ordered to simply shoot any zombie that showed itself at the airlock.  The battlecruiser was called off, and the scientists ship went back to the neutron star.

These days, Humgrades are considered the ultimate in severe environment engineers and miners.  Their natural abilities combined with knowledge make them the ultimate man-portable mining team.
