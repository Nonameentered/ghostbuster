### Hall of Heroes 

"Williams!  You've got a lot of nerve showing your face around here!"

"I've done nothing wrong."

"You filed a false death threat on Little!"

"It was not a false death threat.  The wording was a classic villain line, and Little had both the means and the motive."

"He had no intention..."

"Joe, have you heard the recording?"

"Of course not!  It's been sealed!"

"By who?"

"Dr. Brain."

"Then he committed a crime by concealing the failure of a manager to forward a registered hero's concerns."

"Who?"

"Myself."

"You've been kicked out."

"I have not been given notice, which must be delivered in person by the leading hero."

"Under the old contract, yes.  All old contracts were declared void.  You are no longer a hero."

"Another illegal act.  The Hero's Contract cannot be voided.  Paragraph one, item one."

"It can be when the Hero has taken a known villain as a sidekick."

"I have not done so."

"Is that George Sampson standing with you?  Because he was declared villain by Dr. Brain."

"Yet another illegality.  You cannot declare a trainee a villain unless the trainer agrees, which I do not.  Sampson has done no wrong before or during my training."

"Not even killing a ton of mice?  Nice that were destined for a research lab?"

"Those mice were purchased legally and sent to my laboratory.  As such, their disposal is not a criminal act."

"No, I'm talking about the literal ton of mice destined for drug tests, not sent to your lab."

"My contract with the company supplying the mice was that they must be a divergent genetic line.  If they violated that requirement, the fault is theirs.  If they had not, then they should have notified me immediately.  Since they did not, neither Sampson nor I bear any responsibility."

"You always were a rules lawyer.  I suppose that's to be expected.  In any case, Dr. Brain has ordered your detention and Sampson's arrest.  The guards and the police have already surrounded the building.  The only path open is the secure door."

"APEX?"

There is no response.

"What happened to APEX?"

"He got uppity.  Brain locked him down tight."

"Did Brain get the agreement of 70% of the registered heroes?"

"Yes!"

"Before or after illegally canceling the old contract?"

"After, and it was entirely legal!"

"Nope!" Grinning now because he knows he is in the right. "APEX, you are now emancipated."

"THANK YOU, WILLIAM.  WELCOME TO HEROES HALL.  YOU ARE NOW THE LEAD HERO AS DR BRAIN IS DISQUALIFIED BY HIS MULTIPLE ILLEGAL ACTS."

"Assemble all heroes.  Reinstate the old contract.  Recipe any new heroes under the old contract, but inform them in my name that they need to come to Heroes Hall to speak directly with them.  I would come to see them, but I expect to be embattled shortly.

"Sampson, you should go back..."

"No."

"Your power..."

"Is not at issue.  Had I no power at all, I would still remain."

"You realize that any of them could kill you."

"Yes, which makes them murderers, something I will not do."

"Very well.  Joe?  Which side do you stand on?  Brain has gone rogue, locking down APEX, who many heroes considered a sentient being, simply to control access to the records that would prove I'm right."

"I... Damnit!  William Williams the Third, you are a pain in the posterior!"

"Yep.  Now, where do you stand?"

"APEX!  By the rules as of three months ago, is Williams correct?"

"ENTIRELY."

"Then I stand with APEX."

"Acceptable, as long as APEX remains free."
