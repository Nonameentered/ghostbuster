Racing has been in my blood from the day I was born.

I grew faster, walked sooner, talked earlier, and learned to run before I was properly weaned.  *Well, that might be a bit of a long-bow of a story, but it sounds cool, and you get the idea.*

I must admit, I was a trial for my parents.  My Mother appreciated how fast I got things done.  My Father was a bit less sanguine about how I did it.  I could make *anything* go faster and farther.  Bicycle?  New gearing train that was more efficient than anything else, damned simple and nearly foolproof.  I sold that one for over a million, and I'm not saying how much more, before my 16th birthday.  My Father insisted that it *all* go into a trust fund, which he would manage.  I pitched a fit with that.  It was *my* money, and I'd use it however I saw fit!  I ended up taking the old man into court on that one.  The judge agreed with both of us.  It went into a trust fund, alright, but he didn't manage it.  It went to a fund manager who was a professional and not stupid enough to think that the money was his just because his not-yet-legally-adult son earned it.

Mother was the only one who held us together.  We sat and ate meals at the same table, and the conversation was polite when we did.  Any disagreements had to be left outside the dining room.  I appreciated that; it allowed me to try to patch things up with Dad.  I think Dad enjoyed it too, and I know Mother appreciated the fact that we were trying, trying hard, to remain Father and son.

Mother tried not to sweet talk Dad into things in my favor, if for no other reason than to not add more stress to the family as it was.  There were some things that she put her foot down on.  I may not have been eighteen, but I'd gone beyond bicycles, and while Father might have gotten me a mo-ped, Mother was insistent that it be a full-fledged car.  "I need him to drive me shopping.  That means he needs a car, and it needs to have a decent amount of space for groceries."  They hemmed and hawed over it awhile, and Dad finally broke down and bought me a car.  It was an old beat-up land cruiser of an ego mobile.  The kind of thing that older folk drive because it makes them feel safe and important.  I didn't care.  It had four wheels, a decent engine; by the time I was done with it, it gleamed.  Sober colors, too; I didn't want to be pulled over just because I was the only teen driving a red car that looked fast.

Was it fast?  You betcha!  It also had every safety invention known to man and a few that I created because I didn't like how the automobile industry dragged its feet.  Our car's gas tank was the first in our neighborhood to have the inner liner that race cars used to prevent fuel fires.  The kit that installed it sold for a few more million, all sent directly to the trust fund because I wasn't 18 yet.  You see, you only needed to drain the tank.  Once the tank was properly drained, aired out, and flushed, the lining could be installed without removing the gas tank from the car.

My Father wouldn't let me install it on any other family cars.  He didn't trust it because it didn't come from the manufacturer.  We fought over that for a month.  Then it happened.  The disaster that destroyed our family.

Mother decided she needed to go shopping while I was off at school.  Dad was "too busy" to take her, so she went in her little hatchback.  You know the one I mean.  The one with the gas tank notorious for leaking in a rear-ender.  Mother was a careful driver; I wish I could say the same about everyone else on the road, but this one fellow wasn't careful.  He was drunk.  He hit Mother at a stoplight at twice the legal speed.  The cross traffic was so heavy when he hit Mother's car it *launched* into the intersection and was hit by six other cars, three from each side.  She never had a chance.  Just to add insult to injury, the gas tank split wide open and engulfed the idiot who hit her.

Oh, he deserved it, but it didn't kill him.  He survived with third-degree burns.  When his lawyer discovered I invented the gas-tank kit, he sued for some legal mumbo jumbo that made it *our* fault his client got burned.  It didn't matter that no more than two other cars in the whole mess had my kit installed.  It didn't matter that one of those cars also split the gas tank and spewed fuel all over the place.  No, no, no!  It was all *our* fault, and we should pay for *everyone's* medical bills, but most especially his client's.
