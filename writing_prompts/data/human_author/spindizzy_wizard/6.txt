We bought this storage, and selling some of the everyday items has already paid us back nicelyâ€”only the uncommon remain.

### Catalog #274 

***The Editor*** 

Appearance: A standard #2 pencil with an eraser.  Body color red.  Fine lines are engraved around the body and inlaid with gold and silver alternating.

Function: Use the pencil, without erasing, to write a story.  When you have finished writing, you may begin editing.  Erase everything you *want* to happen, leaving only the things you do not want to happen.

Notes: grammar is important.  Punctuation is essential.  Would-be authors must be able to compose an interlaced trio of stories, each grammatically correct.  The desired story.  The unwanted story.  The combined story is made by interlacing the words of the two base stories.

All three stories must make sense when read aloud, although reading the stories is not essential to the process.

### Safety Notes 

- Do not attempt to use this in the heat of the moment.  You will hurt yourself no matter what your intent is.

- Do not attempt to use this for personal profit.  The universe likes well-crafted stories, not wish fulfillment.

- If you attempt to use the eraser, and the pencil twists in your hand, stop at once.  This is a warning from the universe.  Reconsider what you are attempting.
