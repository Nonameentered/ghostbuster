This... is a farce.

"Look at the defendant!  Flaunting his moniker!  Reveling in mass slaughter!"

The prosecution is laying it on with a trowel.  But I think he's wrapping it up, if for no other reason than the Judge looks about ready to explode from internal pressure.  Yep.  He's done.

"You're on trial today, accused of killing billions of people! How do you plead?"

I guess he's surprised at how calm I am.  Standing, I begin.  I must admit that I am an imposing figure, being seven feet tall yet skeletal in frame, with a scythe built to my scale.  I have chosen my robed form since it is generally my least offensive form.

Although, there are those who find my unrobed form one of barbaric splendor.  I shall not forget that young man.

"I plead not guilty, your honor."

The court is a slithering of voices across the wooden floors and echoing from the walls which have heard some of the most infamous and brutal crimes recounted.  Yet these people are shocked at my plea.  They have forgotten who is genuinely responsible and what my actual function is.

"Are you quite certain you wish to make that plea?"

"Your Honor, with nothing but the greatest respect for this court, your position, and the law, I am here as a *courtesy*.  The people who fear me and call me a murderer are misinformed.  My purpose, here, today, is to re-educate the people of this world as to my nature."

"You deny killing people?"

His voice is incredulous.

"I do so deny."

The court of whispering snakes becomes a seething storm of denial.  I can see the judge pounding his gavel, demanding silence while his face shades towards deep red.  Perhaps it is time to begin education.

"SILENCE."  Spoken firmly, yet not all that loudly, my voice cuts across the storm of protest, cutting it off as I would a soul from the mortal form, which has become nothing but a source of pain and with no hope of recovery.

Turning to the room, "This is your court.  You will show it the respect it deserves, since *it* is your best defense against unwarranted and unnecessary death."

There is not a single person in that audience who can meet my eyes.  They know they have done wrong by this court.  Returning to the Judge, "Your court, Your Honor."

"Thank you, Grim Reaper.  I can see the prosecution itching to present his evidence, but the prosecution will simply have to wait while we settle the issue of jurisdiction.  Grim Reaper, are you above the law?"

"The better question is am I above *all* law, and the answer is no.  I do answer to a law, but no human court enforces that law, nor is that law open to legal maneuvering or political grandstanding."  A sideways look at the prosecutor, whom I know has his eyes on the next guvernatorial election.

"I see.  If that is true, how were you compelled to come to this court?"

"I was not compelled.  I have a certain degree of freedom, within my constraints, and the court I am answerable to took note of the rising tide of outright hatred based on misconceptions.  I was given the choice to come here and set the record straight, if I wished to.  Thus, I am here as a courtesy to this court, with permission to educate the people regarding my true nature and purpose."

"You would usurp the purpose of this court, which is to hear the charges brought before it, and render a verdict under the laws it was formed by?"

I can see the tension under that question.

"Your Honor, the charges are driven by hatred.  I ask the opportunity to correct the misapprehension of the people, and show that my acts are not murder, but a mercy granted by a higher court as the natural right of all living beings."

"How do you propose to do this?"

"By example.  You are perhaps familiar with a motion picture titled "It's a Wonderful Life?"  I swept the audience with my gaze.  I see the comprehension in all but a few faces.  "I see that most are familiar, for those few who are not, I ask permission to gift you with the viewing of the film.  I will not force any judgment upon you regarding that film, but only the experience of seeing it.  Your reactions and thoughts regarding it are entirely yours.  Please nod if you agree."

All but one of those agrees, and a surprising number of those who have already seen it ask to see it again.

The story of a young man, in his prime, who became so despondent that he thought of taking his life.  Yet saved the life of another, which was a constant theme throughout his life to that point, and when he expressed the desire to have never been born, was gifted with the opportunity to see what would have happened if he had never existed.

My presentation will be the diametric opposite, what happens when someone should die, and does not.

"I am sorry, Mrs. French.  Your son has an incurable and inoperable cancer."

"There is nothing that can be done?"

You can see that she was expecting this outcome.  It's almost a relief, even through the grief, to know the truth.

"We can make him comfortable, manage his pain, give him the best life we can in his remaining time, but that is the most we can do."

"Why?"

"Why is that the most?  Or why your son?  For the latter, it is nothing that anyone did..."

I stop the presentation there.  "That is not entirely true.  The correct answer is that it was nothing *anyone they knew about* did.  Let's roll time back ten years, and focus on what happened."

A scene by a creek.  Young boys swimming in a deep pool.  Upstream, a small chemical processing plant.  All the safeguards are in place, even a thick layer of clay, well compacted, to act as a final catch basin in the event of a severe incident.  The incident occurs, almost silently, save for the alarms warning the staff.  Everyone does their jobs, and the spill is cleaned up.  Unknown to everyone, a flaw in the clay.  In one load, a small amount of porous material.  The leak falls on that one spot and a small quantity escapes.  There will be no repeat, and testing later shows "no significant contamination" nor does it show the porous area as the chemical burned it out and vibration from the equipment closed the miniscule opening.
