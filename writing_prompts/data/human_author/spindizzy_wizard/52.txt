## The Interview

Meet Phil.  Prince of Insufficient Light and Supreme Ruler of Heck.

Q: Why Heck?

A: Because anyone who gave a damn went to one of the other places.

Q: Insufficient light?

A: Well, since no one gives a damn, we can't raise enough energy to run the lights.

Q: Why would anyone come here?

A: Would you rather go to Hell?  Or live in Heaven with all those rules and regulations?  If not, Heck is the place for you!

Q: You are commonly presented as a cut-rate devil.

A: Yeah, you wait til that cartoonist gets here.  I guarantee he will change his mind.

Q: Did you ever appear in his strip?

A: I did agree to ONE appearance.  He took it upon himself to not only redraw me in a less than flattering suit, but to put words in my mouth!

Q: Is there anything you regret?

A: One thing.  Adams hit it on the head with that bit about forever poor but appreciated versus rich but having all your work burned before you at the end of each day.  Either of those is far better than what most workers get today.  I wish I had said it.  I wish that I had the power to make that offer.  I wish that the two big guys would stop this stupid feud and take care of the people for a change.
