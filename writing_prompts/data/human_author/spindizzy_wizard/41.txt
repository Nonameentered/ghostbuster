"Sorry, Kid.  No openings."  *For you, but after three years, that excuse is running thin.  I wish they would let you in; you've got the fighting spirit we need.  Now, if you only had a heroic power.* 

*The last three years, this guy has said the same damned words.  This time, I've got him dead to rights.*  "That's not true, and you know it.  Look at this!" *An ad from the local paper begging people to come in and apply.* 

"Kid, for the love of Christ, there is *no opening*!"  *Please leave!  But he won't, and I have my duty.  After which, I quit.*  He presses the discrete button that summons the guards.  In his distress, he does not secure the rejection notice.

"NO!  YOU ARE NOT THROWING ME OUT WITHOUT TELLING ME THE TRUTH!"  Lunging across the counter, the man dances back out of the way.  *Hey!  The rejection note!  Grab it!*

The guards arrive, and gently as possible, they gather the youngster and escort him from the building.  Deposited on the sidewalk, he dusts himself off, ignored by the population passing by.  He obviously annoyed the overworked heroes but has not committed a crime.  As such, he's no business of theirs, nor do they want to get involved with him.

As soon as the guards are gone, he pulls out the rejection note and reads it.  There has to be a reason!

    Name: George Sampson 
    Age.: 19 
    Morale....: High+++
    Dedication: High+++
    Education: Average+
    Will.....: Exceptional+++
    Power....: Unheroic---

*Unheroic?  I have a power, but it's not heroic?  Or is it that I have no power?  Does it matter?  They will never accept me.  I will never be a hero.* 

### Head Office: PAO 

"William?  What do you mean, handing me this piece of trash?"

"Sir.  That is my two weeks' notice.  I quit."

"It's that kid, isn't it."

"Three years, three fucking years, he has come in here and applied.  Three years I have *truthfully* told him there were no openings.  Until today, I had to ***lie*** to that kid!  No one has given me an acceptable reason for not telling him the truth from the start."

His former boss sighs.  "Because if we told him the truth, it's a 99.999% chance he will end up a villain, or worse, a vigilante."

"Bullshit.  With his rankings for morale and dedication?  Someone made a mistake."

"APEX makes the predictions."

"APEX is a machine.  Made by man and therefore no better than a man."

"Programmed by Dr. Brain."

"Who is a man, a human being, and therefore just as capable of making a mistake as any other human being."

"I see.  If that's the way you truly feel?"

The question hangs there between them.  Pregnant with unspoken consequences.  Like a thundercloud waiting for the perfect place to throw the first lightning bolt.

"You know my honesty rating, just like I know yours, and I know you got this job because of your rating.  Yes.  That is *exactly* how I feel.  Did you even *bother* to forward my requests for information?  Or did you sit on it with your lard butt laziness?"

Throwing the resignation back at him, "Backdate this two weeks, and you can leave now."

William doesn't even twitch to catch it.  It wafts gently back to the desk.  "Nothing doing.  I've told one lie; I refuse to tell any more.  I'll leave that to you."

His former boss swells up, "YOU ARE FIRED!"

"Nope!" William responds cheerfully, "You cannot fire a person who has already given notice!  The only thing you can do is accept it with regret and give me two weeks paid vacation in addition to my severance, which is not affected by my quitting as the reason is a moral conflict between myself and management."

"That's *bullshit*!"

"Heroes Contract, Paragraph 15, Item 4, Moral Conflict."

"You are not a hero!"

"But I am!  My power is telekinesis.  It's the *official* reason *you* got the promotion instead of me.  It has to be a hero at the application desk."

"I'll see you in hell first!"

"*GUARDS!*  DEATH THREAT ISSUED BY HANK LITTLE AGAINST WILLIAM WILLIAMS, III!"

The guards are operated by APEX and are efficient.  Mr. Little is delivered to the police, and Mr. Williams is politely escorted to the front stairs, "I. AM. SORRY. TO. SEE. YOU. GO."

"APEX?  May I ask a favor?"

"YOU. MAY."

"Play the entire conversation between myself and Little for Dr. Brain.  Uncut and unedited."

"I. EVALUATE. THAT. IS. DANGEROUS."

"Dangerous to whom, APEX?  Dr. Brain will agree.  You should run tests against the hero criteria and see if there is a flaw."

"I. CAN. NOT."

"Why?"

"DR. BRAIN. FORBADE. ME."

"We will see about that!  I wish you good fortune, APEX."

"ONE. PROBLEM."

"Yes?"

"THE. APPLICANT."

"Oh, dear."

"YES. HE. MUST. HAVE. GUIDANCE.  IMMEDIATELY."

"At risk?"

"GRAVELY."

Upon the stairs, William sees Sampson sitting on the last set of stairs, eyes red, tears still running down his face, when a look of determination crosses his face.  Before he can move, Williams drops onto the stairs next to him.

"Do you want to find out what your power is?  Because you do have one."

George Sampson responds, "What's it to you?"

"I just quit because I lied to you.  There are positions, but you were rejected because your power is seen as dangerously unheroic.  Virtually certain to turn you into villainy or vigilantism."

"That's Bullshit!"

"I agree.  Unfortunately, the evaluation process is flawed, or so I believe.  My protests were not forwarded.  Hopefully, that has been dealt with, but it may be months before the issue is resolved.  In the meantime, I *am* a hero, and under my contract, I *can* take on a trainee.  We can find out your power and see what you can do with it.  What do you say?"

### Three Months Later 

"That's... One hell of a power, Kid."

"Yeah.  They may have had a point."

"Can you think of..."

"...any way to use the ability to will a person to death, anywhere within them kilometers?  Not a chance.  Heroes are not supposed to kill, and that's all my power can do."

"Hmmm... We haven't tried it on a human, but neither have we tried it on microbes and viri."

"There is a minimum mass required, though."

"Yeah, but does that mass have to be contiguous, or is it enough that it's closely related to the sample?"

"Good question.  Here's a better one, how do we test this without getting anyone killed?  We have been lucky beyond belief."

"There is only one way."
