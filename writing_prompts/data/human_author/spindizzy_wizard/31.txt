We warned them.

DYNESTRO TAKES NEW YORK CITY!

We told them what would happen.

GIGABLAST TAKES EASTERN SEABOARD!  DYNESTRO TAKES SOUTHWEST!

We watched in horror.

MASS COMBAT BETWEEN VILLAINS AND MILITARY.

We offered to help.

GOVT SAYS NO!

After that, there wasn't a government left.

LEAGUE OF RULERS PROCLAIMS NEW GOVT!

The local governments outside the United States welcomed us in.  We were forbidden from crossing the border into the US, but if the villains came out, it was Carte Blanche time.

"Do whatever you must to keep them from taking over our country."

MASS MIGRATION!

Yes, US citizens tried to leave their country.

MIGRANTS REPULSED AT BORDER!

LEAGUE OF RULERS THANKS HEROES!

It stuck in our throats, but our duty was to prevent the villains from crossing the border.  They'd made their choice, and the smart ones left as fast as they could.  The smartest of all, Hawaii seceded from the union and declared itself an independent country.

US MILITARY IN HAWAII UNDER HOUSE ARREST.

It was legal fiction, but it allowed us to hold them in place until they finally realized they had three choices.  Go to work for the League of Rulers, die, or join Hawaii.  It wasn't like they could have made a difference; the whole mess was settled before the fleet could have made it within extreme range of their long-range aircraft.

The forces overseas weren't given any choice.  They were shipped back to the states without weapons.

People around the world are outraged.  Our response:

•••

To The People Of The World,

The people of the United States of America chose to implement the Supers Law.  We are bound to respect their choice.  Until they reestablish their government, even in exile, in a manner recognized by the major powers, we cannot intervene.

If you genuinely wish for us to intervene, speak with your governments.  They must recognize a government that accepts and upholds the Constitution of the United States of America unreservedly.

Until that happy day, we can only restrict the League of Rulers to the Continental United States of America.

The Unified Islands of Hawaii will not be forced to rejoin the United States of America. They wisely chose to separate from the Continental government before it collapsed.

Hawaii follows the tenants and laws of the Constitution, with the sole exception that they are its own entity.  Should the USA be restored, we hope Hawaii will be permitted to rejoin without repercussions.

In the end, no one would do anything to help.  We could not, being bound by law.  The people of the world would not, ask them why and hear the excuses.  What finally worked was the in-fighting of the villains allowed the people of the United States to clandestinely hold elections in each precinct and send the results to the Electoral College.  That appendix of a historical process was the only thing that let it work.  Each precinct could organize separately, get their votes tallied, and send them in when and however they had to.

Once there was a recognized President, which took some horse trading in the College, they had the seed of a government.  The surviving Congress Members voted the Supers Law out, the President signed it, and the remainder of the Supreme Court confirmed it as acceptable under Constitutional Law and the existing circumstances.

The instant that document hit our representative's hand at the middle of the Friendship Bridge we moved.

We are not proud of what we did.  It was simply necessary.  There were no survivors of the League of Rulers.  Their excesses merited a federal death sentence, confirmed by all three branches, and we were duly authorized to carry it out.

A constitutional convention is in progress now.  People have had enough of the system that allowed such a law to pass.  It is clear even from before its passage that the people were dead set against it.

We only hope that they remember the base document served this country well for centuries, and do not modify without careful consideration.
