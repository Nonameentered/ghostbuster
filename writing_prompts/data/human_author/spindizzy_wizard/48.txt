I have a unique condition.

I am immortal.

Well, that by itself is not that unique, but I can also see the future.  My discussions with a noted author may inform you.  I see the many paths the future may take, but incompletely.  They rise and fall on long rolling hills; I do my best to influence events such that humanity's future is as long as it can be.

Why do I choose longevity over glory?

Many paths lead to a glorious future, but glorious futures are — in my experience — tied to inglorious ends.  The longest routes do not have glory because a glorious pinnacle leaves far too much room for a deadly fall from grace.

Longevity gives one invaluable benefit.  Perspective.  Glory will take you to inconceivable heights, but you will learn nothing of dealing with adversity or recognizing the precipice you are about to step into blithely.

Name *one* glorious society which has lasted two thousand years.  There are none.  Even the Roman Empire, which in one account could claim one thousand years, was not the Roman Empire that conquered western Europe.  In the end, it fell to a combination of bankruptcy due to one man's insistence on reclaiming the "glory" of Rome-that-was, rather than building on what he had to make it stout enough to survive the plague that brought Rome to an end.

I must admit, I had a hand in bringing Rome down.  Rome needed to remain a golden example that one tries to emulate and not be a curse upon the face of the earth.

It also serves as a warning flare.  When some leader starts spouting drivel about a thousand-year reign or reclaiming the glory of our past, it's time to kick them out before they do any more damage.

After humanity has dealt with adversity long enough, we may finally be ready for glory.

For, you see, each increment of adversity brings about an inevitable rise in society's longevity.  So long as the misfortune does not drive it to extremes.

There must be something in the general human condition that adores extremes, as I am kept busy diverting extremism to survivable ends.

### Time Traveler 

I have passed through the ages like a ghost, afraid to make the slightest change lest I make humanity's lot worse.

What I have learned is that there is some aspect of the human condition that despises golden ages.  Something always happens that prevents humanity from reaching the glory that it could be.

We muddle along in mediocrity, never reaching our true potential, continuously dealing with the last failure's aftermath.

I see the suffering through the ages, and it sickens me.  I will seek out the most eminent scientists, philosophers, and prominent leaders to gather them together for the betterment of humanity.

I will no longer be a fearful ghost.  I will be the shadow in the night that sees the one critical act done to advance humanity to the pinnacle of its potential.

Something new has been added.  In a matter of minutes, the future has changed.  Ah, a traveler from the future.  Probably a silly mistake... What's this?!  That was deliberate!  I have time; I can intervene to correct the timeline.  I need only be there in time.

Then I must spend some time making sure this interference is stopped.

### Time Traveller 

What happened?  I saw the change hit the timeline as I jumped for home, but when I got here, not only was there no change but any opportunity to go back and try again was gone.

### Immortal Guardian 

There.  Perhaps he will draw the correct conclusion that changing the timeline is not permitted for one so limited in scope.
