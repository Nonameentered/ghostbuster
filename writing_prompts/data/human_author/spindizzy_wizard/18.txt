By the time I return, Bill has his voice recorder attached to the phone.  "Sophia?  Do you consent to this recording?" he whispered.  I nodded yes, and whispered, "is it legal?"  Bill nodded yes.  That's good enough for me; Bill is a lawyer, among other things, "then I not only consent, I ask you to record all other calls."  I must have spoken too loud.

"Enregistrée?" came out of the phone, followed by a click, but the line did not go dead.

"Hello?"  De's easy voice opened another set of floodgates in French, a sobbing woman mortified by what she had just heard.  De was in his element, counseling a person having an emotional breakdown.  Bill went to stop the recording, but I motioned no.  This woman would receive Justice.

When she wound down, I asked for the phone.  "Young lady, do you understand English?"

"Yes, Madam."

"Are you a Nun?"

"Yes, Madam."

"Please inform your Mother Superior that you have suffered an emotional insult and request her presence.  We will take this matter from that point."

"Merci, Madam!"

It didn't take long.  I suspect others in the office noted her condition and called for help.  An older voice came on and introduced herself as Mother Superior Marie.

"Mother, the Archbishop called my phone and, without stopping to identify the recipient, or warn the young lady to disconnect, engaged in a foul-mouthed diatribe which we have recorded."

"And what am I to do about this?"

"You can start by providing relief for your distraught Sister.  Someone with more experience should handle this board for the time being.  We expect more calls from the Archbishop, and I would not have a young lady subjected to such abuse."

"Agreed.  Sister Debbie is excused from this duty for the day; she should return to the convent and speak with the appropriate people there."

Off the phone, "Merci, Mère Supérieure."

"She is young for this duty.  I shall take the remainder of this session.  May I ask what brought this about?"

"What have you heard of Father Patrice?"

"Father Patrick?  He has deserted his post, deluded thinking he has a message from God."

"Do you accept my word that he has good reason to believe he does?"

"Provisionally."

"If there are further calls, I would appreciate a witness who is within the body of the Church and on French soil."

"If I am ordered to disconnect, I will need a better reason than your desire."

"Can you assure privacy on your end?"

"For those who might listen within the offices, yes."

"Gentlemen, you will not hear this.  No cheating!"

De promptly stands and stares at the others until they move.  He leads them into the kitchen and starts one of his amusing tales.

"Mother.  I have prayed every night at 10 p.M. local time, thanking god for all I have received and asking for a sign that might convince my friends that god is real.  Father Patrick has awakened every night at 4 P.M. for the last five years.  Lately receiving hints of where I lived and traveling here — he said — to stop those prayers.  What am I to think?  I have had no prior contact with Father Patrick or with the Catholic Church."

"Interesting.  The Archbishop has been selective in his comments.  I consider this of sufficient importance to the Church to override the Archbishop.  You will provide copies of any recorded calls.  In fact, record the entire discussion with Father Patrick.  It may become evidence in an ecclesiastical court on the beatification of a potential Saint if it stands the test of time, as well as the present politics."

"Is Father Patrick in any danger?"

"I think it safe to say that he should remain abroad until this is settled.  Where is he now?"

"In my guest room, he was severely sleep deprived.  We will awaken him in an hour or so."

"I have no right to ask, but if you could refrain from.waking him up until your evening prayer, I think that would be a good test."

"Not to mention letting him catch up on his sleep."

"That too."

An unpleasant buzzing sound interrupted.  "That's the Archbishop.  Please remain silent."

The next conversation, if you could call it that, was the Mother Superior — oh, so, politely and with a touch of a mother humoring an errant child — informing him that his language was a disgrace and that *she* would be monitoring the phone system until *she* was satisfied that he had — it was some colloquial usage involving relearning the Christian language.  I'm pretty sure what it said literally was not what people understood by it.

Did you know you can hear someone gritting their teeth over the phone?

He asked after Father Patrick.  She informed him that he was asleep and likely to be so for some time.
