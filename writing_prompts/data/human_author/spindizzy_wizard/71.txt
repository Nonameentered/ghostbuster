Mr. Stein agreed that made sense and came over to my dad's workshop in an outbuilding on the property.  The two of them worked together to make the shutters, but when it came time to make the shutters for Mr. Stein's house, he became all thumbs and ended up with a number of cuts.  Mother bandaged them up nicely for him and told him, "get back to work; it's not a proper shutter until someone's bled for it."  He made a funny face, laughed, and went right back to my father's workshop.  Both of them had a few bandages those months, as they had to rough saw the wood, dry it carefully, finish saw it to get the pieces they needed, and hammer it all together without a bit of metal holding it together.  By the end of it, they were laughing with each other over making those shutters.  "RAwwwerrr!" with their arms opening like a crocodile's and laughing.

I never told my parents, but after we returned to that house to get some things, I spent some time on the ground, looking at tracks.  It was easy to see where the firemen had been, and I got a good look at the trunk of the tree that tried to come in through my window.  Yes, the trunk was bitten through, but the blood marks on the trunk weren't sap; they were something else.  Something deep green and sticky.  When we went back to the Steins' house, I quietly asked Michael if I could see his Monster.  He solemnly held Monster out to me, and I could see a green stain on the teeth that wasn't anything like the glaze we'd used.  I thanked him, and I thanked his Monster.  When I turned around, my Mother was there, I nodded to her, and we went back to the kitchen.  Mrs. Stein was brewing something up that my Mother had told her about.  A tea that would help anyone in the house breathe deeply without the stinky chemicals that most pharmacists would recommend.  It smelled like apple pie and fresh air after a storm.  It smelled like everything good and left you feeling refreshed after a good deep breath.

My friends and I have remained close, and we always know when one of us is not feeling well.  When Marcia went to Brazil and got lost, we knew.  I was free, so I went.  I got a local guide, and we drove in the direction I felt her.  She was hurt but had been taken in by the old woman of the village.  She'd told the old woman that someone would find her and that as long as they wore a bracelet like hers, they were good friends who could be trusted.

It was good that she had told the old woman that because Marcia was delirious from infection.  We got her back to a hospital that got her stabilized, then her trip insurance kicked in, and that got us a hospital flight back to the states.  Despite our generally different appearance, Marcia's delirious insistence that her *sister* accompany her got me on the same flight.  We landed together just as her fever broke.

"I knew you would come."

"I couldn't not come; you're my sister."

Our families are much larger now, and every child has a Monster to keep the window safe.  Every house has shutters made from heavy wood.  And my mother is teaching all of us the "wisdom of the mountains that runs as deep as the deepest oceans."

There are always good hard-headed practical reasons why what she teaches us works, but my sisters and I?  We know the truth.  There's magic in those mountains, and it runs deeper than the deepest ocean.
