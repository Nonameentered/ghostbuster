This is my turf, from 6 pm to 9 pm, Friday and Saturday nights.

It has been my turf for the last twenty years, but tonight, someone else stands in that place while I lie at their feet, beaten to a bruised mass of flesh.

They looked at me and saw an old bum.  No one would care if they took this place from me.  No one would notice if I weren't there.

Of course not; I'm only a bum.

Why should I have this small stage in the slums of the city?  I was nobody.  They would be somebody long before anyone took notice of my absence; after all, I was only a skinny, smelly, old bum.

I would never walk the stages of the world with grace, never receive the accolades of a caring audience, and never amount to anything.

I would weep if I didn't hurt so much—no more ballet before the appreciation of my fans, no more sharing my inner world of balance and beauty.  Only an old bum crumpled on the filthy ground.

"Excuse me."  Bill!  No!  Don't get involved!  They'll hurt you too!

"And what do you want, you pathetic old fool?  A beating like the one we gave him?"

"Of course not.  But I am here to watch Pitre dance, as he does every Friday and Saturday night from 6 to 9."  Bill?  You watched?

"Beat it before we beat you."

"I think not."  Grace?   Oh God, please, not Grace!  The tears that I would not give the ones who beat me now flow freely—two friends who will shortly be bloody and broken.

"A hag like you?  You, we'll just kill.  Your ugly might be contagious."  They laugh cruelly.

"That was a bad thing you said.  I do not want to hear more bad things from you."  Oh, Please, God!  Send them away!  David has never understood how dangerous these streets are, and I cannot save him tonight!

"Well, well, well, the Dummy has a voice, after all.  Get lost, all three of you.  We've got a show to put on."

Please, my friends!  Leave!  Live!  I cannot perform tonight in any case!

"My dear boy, who said there were only three of us?"  A growl from the night.  Glowing eyes open, surrounding the band that sought my space.  Night wolves.  Humans who prowl the streets, taking whomever they will.  No one stands against them.  Please, please, go away!  Do not harm my friends!

"Leave Human.  We claim this space from 6 to 9 every night.  You have no place here."  That gravelly voice!  Elijah?  A Night Wolf?  I would never have guessed!  He's such a pleasant person; for all his growly voice, I have never heard him threaten anyone.  Tonight, his voice promises death.

The band starts running, and the howl — that terrifying quavering sound that signals the hunt — rises on all sides.  A measured ten count and the sounds of the pack in motion surround me, never touching me, but there are whispers.

"Rise, Dancer!"

"Live, Dancer!"

"Move, Dancer!"

Each whisper comes with a small spray of something I did not believe existed.  Wolf Scent.  It gives them strength, endurance, and the will to continue, no matter the cost.  Strength returns, pain falls to the wayside, and I can breathe again despite the broken ribs.

"Tonight, Pitre, you will dance as yourself.  No fancy clothes, no dressed-up stage, only yourself and your incomparable skill.  Show the world the truth.  The person you despise on the street may be the one you adore in performance.  You may wear a mask, but I suggest the mask of pain you wear now is more appropriate.  Show them who you truly are."

Quickly, we prepare an introduction.

Scene: a darkened city mews.  A space like a farm yard, only this is paved, with a few inadequate sodium lights, dripping with rain, and cold enough that fog forms low on the ground.

A figure advances through the night, the fog swirling around its four paws.  It stops in the center of the stage.  In a slow-motion horror, the wolf transforms into a man.

"I am Loupgarou," the gravelly voice states.  The harmonics in the voice bring shivers to the audience's spine.  "What happened here was very nearly a tragedy that none of you would ever have known about because none of you have eyes to see the truth that stands before you if it does not stand upon a glittering stage.  This is Pitre's stage.  You have come to the right place."  The glowing eyes sweep the audience.  "Do not think to look away.  Do not think to leave.  Tonight, you will bear witness to one man's life.  If you fail," the most swirls up as the voice becomes a whisper, "never go into the dark again."  Only the glowing eyes remain, "We will be there, waiting."

Scene: The same space, but as the mist fades with the eyes, the stage becomes a brutal reality.  Dirty, trash against the walls, and poor lighting.

Standing in the middle of the stage is an old man.  A bum.  He lifts his head, so slowly, as if afraid of being struck.  The bruises on his face are terrible, though not as bad as they will be.  His eyes are already swelling shut.  Many in the audience gasp with recognition.  They have seen this man on the street!  He cannot be the Great Pitre!  They begin to stand, seeking the aisles, only to find Night Wolves surround the audience space in their hunting forms.  The growl is subsonic, but you can feel it in your viscera.  They return to their seats.

The man on the stage divests himself of his clothing, down to the short tights he wears as a matter of course.  Each movement is a flowing moment of time.  Each garment removed shows more injuries.  Someone in the audience sobs.  Pitre stops, and graces them with a glance of pity.

Why should he pity them?

Because if these injuries make them feel for him, then they *should* be crying at the end of every performance.

Ballet is pain.

You will have blisters.

Good schools teach you how to tape your feet, so that when the blisters break — which they will — you don't ruin a good pair of shoes.

The dance begins.

"No one who was not at that show can ever understand the power and grace that Pitre was.  Nor can words do justice to the work presented that night.  No recordings were made, or at least, no one will admit to having one.  It has been six months since Pitre's last performance.  He has not been seen on the stage since.  We search, but after his collapse at the end of the show, and this long without word, we fear the worst."
