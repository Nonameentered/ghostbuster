Aw, shit.  I'm so damned hungry; where are the meaty dinos that you can chow down on?  All I see are these stupid waddling things in black and white.  And what is it with all this white shit all over?  What is this crap!?  I can't even feel my toes anymore!

Well, if there's nothing else, at least there's a shitton of the stupid things—time to chow down.

He's dignified—after all, wearing a tuxedo will do that—but his voice has this pensive tone.  "Martha?  I've got that itchy feeling again."

She—on the other hand—would sound snarky while reading the Gettysburg Address.  "Well, John, if you would stop sliding on your di..."

John interrupts quickly, "not *that* itchy feeling," but not soon enough to stop the neighbors from snickering.  "The one that says something big is lining us up in its sights."

Exasperated, "John!  I am **not** moving *again*; we just got all our stones back from the Simpsons!"

"You'll move if I tell you to!  You know what happened last time!"

"That was a polar bear—which almost never show up here—and would stand out against the stones!  That's *why* we moved here."

Fred Simpson, still smarting from being pecked at until he "gave back" the stones he "borrowed," laughs and comments, "Yeah, John!  No polar bears here!  What?  You think rock is going to sneak up on us here?"

Turning towards Fred, John stops.  Looks up, up, up, and says, "Martha?  RUN FOR OUR CHICK'S LIFE!"

Damn, they're going to run all that juicy fat off them!  Let's see if the scare-stun still works.  ***"ROAAARRRR"*** 

There is a moment of silence for a sound that hasn't been heard in millennia.  Then the hindbrain, which never lets go of a critical warning trigger, takes over.  Penguins are moving in all directions spreading the alarm, and recreating the effect of starlings swarming around, but in two dimensions.

"KEEP MOVING, MARTHA!  HE'S CONFUSED!"

"I can't!  I'm too heavy!"  And she is.  She was about to lay their egg.

"YOU KEEP MOVING TO THE WATER.  I'LL DRAW IT OFF!  FRED!  BREAK LEFT!  I'LL BREAK RIGHT, STRAIGHT UNDER HIS NOSE.  SEE IF I CAN'T GET IT TO FACE PLANT!"

"ON TWO, JOHN!  ONE TWO BREAK!"

••• 

OH NO YOU DON'T, YOU TASTY MORSEL!

***WHAM BAM, FACE IN THE PAN*** 

***CRACK!***

"Doctor Gilgamesh, I do not give two figs for your uninformed and pedantic opinion.  I have what is undeniably a Tyrannosaurus Rex in the middle of the Penguin breeding ground, *steaming* and moaning.  I have sent you photographic proof and a video of the same.  You can accept that I am telling the truth, or I will hang up and call Doctor Flint."  There are irascible sounds coming from the phone.  "Why?  Because I can be.  Now, you get your lazy ass up here before it kicks the bucket, document the fact that it is still alive, then we can bring in whoever!"

"John?"

"Yes, Martha?"

"Did Fred make it?"

"I'm not sure.  The beast swerved just as it face-planted.  I think Fred is under it."

••• 

"Well, don't that beat all!  This little guy must have dodged under him to draw him away from the others.  Brave as hell!"

"Yes.  Indeed!  We would do well to ensure this one breeds as much as possible.  Such bravery must be conserved!"

"Hey, Baby.  It's the Hero of the Moving Stone."

"Ohhhh!"
