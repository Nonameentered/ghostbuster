Our lawyer was out of his league.  With my trust fund on the line, I could feel the decision going against us.  Why my trust fund?  It was the gas kit, and my Father didn't have that kind of money anyway.  I asked our lawyer for a chance to talk with the judge directly.  Our lawyer refused.  I stood up in court myself, "If it pleases the court?"

"Mr. Early, I strongly suggest you sit down," came from our lawyer.

"Your Honor?  May I speak with you?  As one reasonable human being to another?"  I ignored our lawyer, much as he had ignored me as unimportant, my Father being the "adult" in this scenario.  An "adult" who I had begun to hate with a passion.  Was it rational?  No.  Then again, I saw it as his fault that Mother was dead thrice over.  Once for refusing to allow me to install the gas kit on our cars.  Twice for being "too busy" to take his wife shopping.  Three times for not even thinking to try and talk her out of going.  I told you it wasn't rational.  She was dead; rational left the house when she died.

"I assume you would prefer the conversation to be private?"

"I would indeed, Your Honor."

"Very well, the court is in recess for... thirty minutes?"

"Thank you, Your Honor."

When the lawyer tried to follow us into the judge's chambers, the judge stopped him.  When my Father tried to follow, I stopped him.  The judge had to back me up on that one.  I suppose the look I gave him, like I wished he was dead instead, finally got through to him.  He went pale and walked back to the courtroom to join our lawyer.

"Mr. Early?  I suspect there's something between you and your Father."

"With respect, Your Honor, call me Jerry.  Mr. Early is my *father*."  I guess I must have said that word with a bit more emotion than I would have preferred.  The judge's eyebrows went up like rockets.

"Jerry, are you certain you want to have this conversation now?  You are not what I would consider stable enough to enter negotiations."

"I wish to make you aware of certain facts.  Facts that *our* lawyer and my *father* have seen fit not to include in our documentation."

"I should probably turn you down, but I suspect you'd find some way to drag it out into court anyway.  Here, you might be talked out of it.  There, it'll be part of the public record.  Alright.  Spill it."

So I did.

1. The trust fund was entirely mine.  My Father had no part in it except as a beneficiary should I die before I came of age.
2. My Father refused me permission to install the gas kit on all of our cars.  Not that it would have made a difference for my Mother, but at least we wouldn't be *here* with this — pardon my french — god damned stupid lawsuit that had no business being in court at all!  (He twitched a smile at that, I think he agreed, but as I later learned, the law is a thicket of briar bushes that can trap and strangle anyone.)
3. At least one other car split its tank too.  Why were the automobile manufacturers still not installing the gas tank liners?  Why were *they* not in this courtroom for negligence?  I told him why.  "We've got money, but not as much as them.  This is just a sleazy drunk driver and a shyster going after the deepest pockets they can reach with the least effort."

"And what would you like me to do about it?"

"Sever my trust fund from the settlement.  It's *mine*.  I'm damned well going to use it to force the automotive industry to finally own up and install every safety gimmick I've invented or dreamed up on every car they make.  If it's the last thing I do, I'll see them pay through the nose for every accident with an injury that could have been prevented with just an ounce of care in the vehicle."

"Just how many do you have?"

"How much time have you got?"

He picked up his phone and called the courtroom.  "Chester?  The court's adjourned for today. ... New information on the current case. ... No, his Father and their lawyer are definitely *excluded* from this.  They've already pissed in the pool; I'm not going to give them a chance to try and spin it. ... That's too bad for them.  If they don't leave quietly, throw them in jail.  Thirty days for contempt of court."  He hung up and looked at me, "Make it march.  We've got the rest of the day."

I whipped out my laptop and projector and started showing him everything I'd already done.  Things that were still going through patents, and every blue sky idea that I didn't have the money to bring to fruition because it was all tied up in the trust fund that my Father insisted on.  Then I got out the analysis I'd done of my Mother's car.  How a design change, simple in manufacturing, would have protected the gas tank without compromising any other feature of the vehicle, not even price, which I had told the automobile company about two years ago.  "They knew.  They did nothing.  They have denied ever receiving my paper.  I have the U.S. Post Office receipt, signed by the secretary of their chief engineer, showing that they did receive it.  I tried to get that consumer crusader to weigh in.  He'd just won against a foreign car manufacturer and said he wasn't interested in taking on an American car manufacturer.  Not enough new interest to pay for the effort."

I had to stop there.  I was starting to lose my temper all over again.  I sat there and *forced* my body to relax.  The judge was kind enough to let me get myself back under control.  Quietly, he asked, "Anything else?"

"No, Your Honor.  I want that money to put some meaning to my Mother's death.  I don't want any other kid to lose his Mother in a flaming car accident that she *could* have walked away from uninjured.  No way in hell do I want the asshole who killed her to profit from her death.  He has insurance, so let them pay for his plastic surgery."

"What of the others involved."

"If it hadn't been for the lawyer they went in on to grab my money; I might have been willing to help. As it is, they're no better than the drunk driver who caused the whole mess.  If he's got enough money to hire that lawyer, even with help, then they can go after him and his insurance company, not people who have suffered more than they have."

"You sound remarkably cold-hearted."

"Your Honor?  My heart froze solid the day my Mother died.  My sympathy died when I saw the vultures gathering.  My empathy died when my *Father* was prepared to throw my future, plans, and hopes to those vultures to cover the essential fault in this miserable mess."
