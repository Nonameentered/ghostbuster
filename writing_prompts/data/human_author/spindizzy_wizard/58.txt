>a fairly good indicator of competency, wouldn't you agree?

Yes, he is a more than competent surgeon, which does not make him a good person, nor does it assure an accurate evaluation of a nurse.

It isn't stated in the story (at that point) how long either of them had worked together, which made his knee-jerk evaluation insulting.

She had arrived just in time to see the MC rolled into the OR, more dead than alive.  With years of experience before her arrival, she is as competent as that surgeon to judge when something is unusual.  A fact that the surgeon was unaware of but which does not excuse the insult.  At best, and as he implied, it is mitigation for his ill-mannered comments.

>Any ordinary person would have easily evaded the grip of a bedbound man.

The scene starts the day after surgery, and from his ability to take notice almost immediately, he's not as bedbound as you might think.  He wasn't sure about himself until later in that scene, but it was a damned good indicator of his physical state that the surgeon *could not* pull free.  An attempt that would have stressed the MC's core muscles to resist.

>It makes the character not only come across as a white knight, but also a Mary Sue.

I already agreed to white knight, but how does Mary Sue come into it?

While a few of the characters I have written come across to me as self-reference, I don't publish those.  I would rather my characters stand on their own.

Do I care about civility?  Yes.  I hope you do too.  From this conversation, I believe you do.

Do I get annoyed when I see injustice or insult?  Yes.  I seldom have the opportunity, or right, to intervene, but it makes sense for this character to do that in this case.  He is involved, and he would far rather have the nurse on his side than the surgeon.

He's still putting things together in his conscious mind, but his subconscious is far more caught up.

Mary Sue, and the male equivalent Gary Stu...

Ah.  I just looked up the definition.  There are *two* definitions of the Mary Sue character type.  One is what I thought you meantâ€”a self-insert.  But now I understand what you're getting at.

> > An idealized character who is talented at everything and has no significant flaws but may have a tragic backstory.

Some versions of James Bond fall into that definition.  Omnicompetent, tragic backstory and no major flaws revealed most of the time.  (In the middle of rewatching all the J.B. movies, maybe they're bleeding through.)

I wish they hadn't overloaded that definition.  It is confusing.

In any case, he does have flaws.  One of which is self-doubt.  *It cannot be that easy, can it?*

Sometimes, just sometimes, the enemy ***is*** incompetent.

Anyway, as this is coming "hot off the pen," so to speak, it counts as no more than a first draft.  It would need at least two more rewrites (a time-consuming task for a no-pay story) before I would call it anywhere near ready for publication.

I already have three Reddit novels that have undergone multiple rewrites and another that I'm attempting to follow the "hero's journey," I am stuck in part two with no more than a rough idea of what parts three and four will look like.

Part two is stuck because I'm torn between finding justification for a two-week convoy to take longer or cutting some relevant character development out of the story.

Hm.  Maybe they have to hole up for awhile because of the bad guys chasing them?  That could work.

No, no, no.  Finish this one.  Then go look at that.
