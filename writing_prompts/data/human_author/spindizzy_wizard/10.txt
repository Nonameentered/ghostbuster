### Four Years Later

I'd been racing cars for the last four years and got my first shot at F1 this year.  My very first race.  I wish I could say it was Monaco, but no one is going to put a new driver into a race like Monaco on his first race.  No, this was Melbourne Grand Prix, possibly the easiest track in the entire series.

Not that I minded!  It was the foot in the door I'd been looking for.

- A car on the F1 circuit.
- That needed a driver.
- That also needed some ideas to get it to go faster.
- That needed some money to keep on the circuit.

I fit all their needs, and when they agreed to let me try out anything I wanted on their car, I was good to go as long as it didn't violate race rules.

We won the race *by five laps!*  That was unprecedented.  Outrageous.  Drew the scrutiny of every official on and off the track.  It didn't matter to me because we won fair and square.  I had every improvement I'd made checked by the track officials and the F1 governing body.  The worst they could do to me was make it illegal *after* the fact, which would not change the result of this race.

You have to understand.  Even on a "very easy" track, winning by five laps is unheard of.  It means I had to pass all the remaining cars on the track FIVE TIMES to get there.  This was against some of the hottest drivers in the world, who were warming up for the 'real' F1 season as they thought it.  I showed them that the racing season started *now.*  They'd be a long time living this down.  A first-time F1 driver rubbing their noses in it this badly?  And I was expecting news from the states, a critical case against the automobile companies was in the last stages of the trial, and it looked touch-and-go.  I needed to win this race to keep funding my fight with them and keep the car funded.

Oh, the purse from this race was peanuts, but the sponsor agreements were critical, and this car needed a decisive win with a decisive driver to get the sponsors to up the ante.

Me?  I was riding the adrenaline rush.  Fresh off the track, they wanted me for an after-the-race interview.  Over the likes of last year's winning driver/car combination.  He had gone to the broadcast area, expecting they would want to see him.  He nearly lost it when I showed up and was ushered right in.

They got through all the usual interview stuff, and I kept my cool when they kept trying to needle me into saying something controversial.  I didn't need controversy.  I needed to show that I was a serious driver, here to stay, and you'd better not ignore my engineering abilities.  Well, I think I got the better of that.  I might talk like an American, but y'all better get used to that too.  I aim to be here for a long time.

I thought we were done, but they had a special guest.

"Jerry, we have a special guest here today who came all this way to see you." Turning to the audience, "Give Mr. Jerry Early, Sr. a warm welcome!"

My father.  My father walked out on that stage in his best business suit with a briefcase, and I lost it.  I started crying like there was no tomorrow.  You see, we'd not only split on bad words, but over the following year, he'd refused every attempt I'd made to contact him.  The year after that, I was so burned by his behavior and so busy myself that I refused every contact he made.  It went quiet then.  The only communications I had with the states were the team of lawyers going after the automobile manufacturers.  I'd pretty much given up on ever speaking with my father again.

And here he was, Mr. Jerry Easy, Sr. Esq.

That's right; he's a lawyer.  Not civil, or he might have been tempted to represent us himself.  He was in corporate law.

I didn't care if he came here to berate me again.  I cared only that he *did* come, and he *was here in person* where neither of us could hang up on the other.

I stood up, tears in my eyes, and saw that he was crying too.  We embraced for the first time in six years.  Neither of us could stop crying, so the hosts filled the crowd in on all the juicy details.  I listened with half an ear, and what I got was more than an earful.  They'd brought him here specifically to have him fight with me. He picked up on that too.  "Don't worry, Son, I've got something they would never expect."

We finally got settled down, and my father, my brilliant father, shot down every one of their innuendoes, insinuations, and barbed comments without so much as turning a hair.

"But we were assured that you had a critical announcement of importance to your son!  We understood that you were part of the legal teams working on the automobile industry lawsuit."

"Of course I am!  I am the newest member of Johnson, Johnston, and Jackson."

I smelled a rat.  That was my leadership team.

"I have here the results of the court case after all the appeals.  The only court remaining is the Supreme Court, which has refused to stay the court orders and refused to hear the case.  This is the final decision of the courts... Ah... at least until the automobile manufacturers come up with some new legal theory to test."  He'd opened his briefcase and withdrew one of those long court documents.  He held it out to me.  "I hope you haven't forgotten how to read a court document, Son."

I started reading it quickly and found my eyes tearing up again.

I looked up and said, "This one is for you, Mom.  WE WON!  WE WON!  WE WON!"

It took a lot longer than the hosts wanted, but we explained this legal win to everyone.  What it would mean for automobile safety going forward.  What it would mean for the safety of the race car drivers.  What it would mean for the average man on the street, or the child, is that they would not *needlessly* lose a loved one.  The drunk drivers would be nailed to the wall because the *car* would know they were drunk and overrode the safety system.

By the end of it, you might as well have called that show the Jerry and Jerry show.  Even their producers were telling the hosts to shut up and let us roll.

Afterward, My Dad and I went out for drinks.  My treat.  We got drunk, got into a fight over something I don't remember anymore, and ended up in the local lockup.  Same cell.  We spent the rest of the night getting sober and talking.  By the end of it, we'd made up for all the hurt we laid on each other and laid the foundation for a new relationship going forward.  With the legal battle finished, it was now time to really hammer on the patents and the patent infringers.  J, J, J & E would lead that team as well.  My father at the forefront.
