Mr. Wilson asked the following question.  "So, Joe, who's on what side?"

"That's harder to tell.  Most people would say you are on the creator's side, Mr. Wilson.  Just based on this building.  But a building is just a building, and a building can hold whatever you choose to put into it.  You have chosen to fill this building with a supportive environment that would automatically get people to trust whoever was in charge.  They would *assume* that the only possible source of this environment is the creator, but you've told me that the creator *could not* interfere.  If this place is not interference, then I do not know what interference is."  I cock my head at him, "On that basis, I would say that you come from the group that followed Lucifer."

"And does that make me evil?"

"Evil is harm done when harm is not needed.  I can only speak of what you have done for me.  Up until HAL, I would have said that you are not evil.  Only you *had* to have known what HAL was, and you sent me straight to it.  I do not think of HAL as evil, but he *is* powerful.  If HAL disliked me, I'm pretty sure I would end up in the past, or maybe the future, and HAL would not be around.  I would have been banished, and without any support net, I would likely die."

"Yet that act would be on HAL, not me."

"Your act placed me in a position of danger without either my consent or knowledge.  That act is evil."

"Is it?  If it is necessary to save the lives and souls of millions?"

"It's still evil; it's also expedient.  How many acts of expedience are also evil?"

"All of them."

"Yes.  There has never been a truly expedient act that was not also evil.  So, you are a follower of Lucifer, who will do whatever he must to succeed."

"Joseph?"  Martha interrupted, "Neither Lucifer nor *Mr. Wilson* is truly evil.  Each does what they think may be best for everyone involved."

"If their choices are based on expedience, then their acts are evil, and their intent does not change that fact.  I remind you of the saying, "The road to hell..."

They finish in chorus, "is paved with good intentions."  Mr. Wilson continued.  "It's surprising how many people don't know the other half of that saying.  Do you know it, Joe?"

I genuinely do not, so I shook my head no.

"...while the road to heaven is paved by good acts.  Yes, I do act from expedience *when I must*, but I do *act*, and more often than not, the results are what I believe you would call good."  He became thoughtful, "Consider your case.  I knew who your parents were.  I knew the sort of power they had.  I also had a small idea that you were nothing like them.  The very fact that you *had a power* that you *refused to use* told me that you had a moral strength that they lacked.  When they turned on you, I chose to offer you a chance.  It was both expedient and a risk."
He stopped there and waited while I thought it through.  I'm ashamed to say it took me longer than it should have, but I did get there.  While Mr. Wilson went about getting coffee and snacks together, I sat there like a lump, examining my life.  I started depressed at the mess that I had made of my life, but then I started seeing the other side of things.  I *was not* like my parents.  I had made a life base on *honesty* and *helping others*.  My parents would never understand that or believe that it could be successful.  And yet, here I was.  Was his decision to *offer* me assistance expedient?  Yes.  And it *did* put me at some risk from my parents; if they had believed I could make anything of my life, they would have done everything in their power to stop me.  By now, I understood that could and would include killing rather than allowing me to succeed.  Yet, Mr. Wilson also put himself or his operation at risk.  By attacking him, possibly using me as the vector for their attack, they would destroy one of the few businesses in this city they did not already influence.  If they came to understand the nature of this... church, they would spare no effort to bring it down with Mr. Wilson.  I was vaguely aware of the good works of this church, but as I did not think I depended on them myself, I hadn't bothered learning more.  All I knew came from the people I talked with at the hotel.  Even the "ladies" found the church a good Sunday place.  If you think those ladies have an easy life, think again.  And that's when it hit me; the hotel was another place where Mr. Wilson, or someone like him, put out a place that felt like home and was *safe*.  Prostitution is a fact of life; whether you dress it up as a "mistress" or dress it down to a one-dollar crib on a wharf, it's still prostitution, and it still has more ways to do it wrong than it does to do it right.

The hotel was doing it "right."  There was a clinic on the property; it was run entirely independent of the second and third floors, but the ladies who make the most use of those floors *also* attended the clinic regularly.  The hotel ensured they had plenty of soap, towels, and hot water.  They also discretely supplied prophylactics.  Yet the best they can do is reduce the chances of infection.  The ladies knew they could go to the clinic anytime and get tested.  Most of them did it once a week; the cost was low, and both welcomed the security it offered both them and their clients.  Before they became infectious, they would be warned, and low-cost treatments would be made available.  For those who contracted something more serious, there were alternatives available, many of them by way of this church.  The greatest fear is abandonment when you are ill.  Mr. Wilson, and the people he worked with, removed that fear.  When you do not fear, you can hope.  You can think about making a better life.  Mr. Wilson was right; his road was headed to heaven because he *acted*.  Which left me in a quandary... If the creator was real, and Lucifer was real, who was the evil one in this act?

The creator could not be because he had good reason to withhold assistance.  Assisting would result in people coming to depend on that assistance rather than standing on their own feet and living with the consequences of their actions.  If you have freedom of choice, then you must have the freedom to accept the consequences of your choices.  Consequences are painful if your actions are not good.  You may still face consequences even if your acts are good.  The world is not fair, it has never been, and the best you can hope for is that the people who love you see to it you get what you need.

Mr. Wilson loved me.  Why it took me this long to recognize that is something I may never understand.

I looked at the two of them and saw they had been closely observing me.  They both nodded as if I had come to the most important conclusion of all.

And I realized that I had.  I realized that someone outside my skin loved me.
