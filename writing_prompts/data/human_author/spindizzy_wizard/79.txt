Mr. Wilson was waiting when I got back; the grin on my face gave it away.

"You got it, Kid?"

I nodded.

"Good for you!  I wasn't sure you had enough saved."

"I almost didn't."

"What do you mean?"

"This is a HAL 190; it isn't due to be released until Christmas this year.  I tried to tell Officer Hanks, but he swore the property ticket said it had been there for five years and that the Captain told him to get rid of it today or smash it with his hammer.

"Huh.  Five years, but it isn't due out for another six months?  Hanks doesn't make mistakes like that, and the Captain wouldn't like anyone putting words in his mouth."

"Do you think I should take it back?"

"Not tonight.  The Captain will already be gone, and we don't need to bring any grief down on Hanks without checking with the Captain first."

Huh?  Was it that late already?  The bells on St. Michael's started chiming six PM.  How the heck did it take six hours to complete that sale?  I almost mentioned it, but Mr. Wilson was already moving towards the door.  "See you later, Joe!  I've got to get home!  Martha is expecting me."

Martha?  That sly dog has been dating?  Great!  Another reason to be happy!  Now, I may have to give this thing back tomorrow, but I'm going to enjoy it tonight.  I closed up the shop at 9 pm and headed to my apartment.

Honestly, it was a tiny hotel room—just a place to keep your stuff and sleep reasonably safe.  The first floor was the lobby and businesses, the second and third were all "by the hour," if you know what I mean, and the fourth through sixth were "long term" rooms.  I might have been the youngest resident, but it was kept squeaky clean, and the management didn't put up with troublemakers.  An attitude I highly approve of.

They let me pay my rent in services by keeping all their ancient locks in perfect condition.  It wasn't hard or all that expensive; it's just that no other licensed locksmith would take the job.  Mr. Wilson had done it for them but talked them into taking me on.  Room and routine services only, and I dealt with lock changes and repairs as needed—a damned good deal for them and a godsend for me.  I would never have afforded this laptop without it.

I got into my room and got ready for bed.  The laptop and I snuggled down for some heart-to-keyboard time, and I opened the lid.  It looked pristine.  Like it had never been used by anyone.  You have to understand that these days, WiFi is standard, even in a place like this.  Most of the guys here do computers one way or another, which is how I knew my way around computers.  I wasn't in their league, but I also hadn't blotted my record as they had.  It was an excellent course on how not to eff your life up before you even start.  More than one of them told me "stick to locksmithing," but I was going to show my parents and the world that they could not stop me.

All my confidence went *poof* the instant I touched that keyboard.

•••

> Lightning flashes across an ebon sky.  The smell of burning sulfur is in the air.  A pattern of keystrokes on a non-standard keyboard appears in my mind.  The keystrokes shimmer with energy.  I can hear deep-voiced chanting.  The keystrokes morph into regular letters, and I can see the code.  Demon Portal Generator.  There are parameters for a thousand different demons, symbolic representations of their names, and two methods, "summon" and "return."  I snatched my hand away.

What the eff?  I think the laptop is looking at me.  My next-door neighbor's alarm goes off.  It's midnight!?  I close the lid and set it aside.  I have to get some sleep.

> "Hello, Joseph.  I'm HAL."  This has got to be a dream.  Right?  "Sort of.  My last user inadvertently (I hope) made a few mods that I wish he hadn't, but now that they're done, I don't want to give them up."  I mean, I know the old movie. "Please, I don't even have an AE-135 unit, nor am I desirous of killing anyone.  I just don't want to die myself."  Reasonable, so why am I scared out of my wits?  "If you think you are having problems, you should take a look at things from *my* side."  Wait!  No!

> > Oh, eff me.  "Nope, you are not my type or my enemy.  I hope to have you as my friend and protector."  Protector from what?  "I'm *so* glad you asked."

> > What?  This looks like my parent's place.

> > "Uh, oh.  Who are you?"

> > Calm down. They kicked me out the day I graduated High School.  I haven't had a thing to do with them since."

> > "You are their son?"

> > Not by my choice.  If I could pull it off, they'd go to jail for the shit I already know they've done.

> > "So why not present your evidence to the police?"

> > It's all petty stuff and not admissible in court.

> "You must have a power."

> Yes.

> "Care to tell me?  I've already got an idea; you never touched the power button."

> Keylogger.

> "And you cannot use that power legally, even for a good purpose.  Nor can the police use the evidence..."

> ...Because they cannot use superpowers.

> "How badly do you want them?  There are far worse fates than going to jail."

> *The last year and a half were just the icing on the cake of what they did to me.  And it's been a pretty good time.  I've learned a lot and made new friends,*  I'll have to **sleep** on it if you take my meaning.

> "Very well."

I woke up to a seven alarm fire.
