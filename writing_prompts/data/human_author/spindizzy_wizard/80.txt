"Joe!  Joe!!"

Mr. Wilson sounded excited, "In back, Mr. Wilson!"

He came back with a huge smile, "I just got done with a job at the police station.  They have a laptop that's going up for sale, and the property clerk agreed to give you first crack at it!"

"Now!?"

"Right now!"

I jumped up and headed for the door.  "Thanks, Mr. Willson!"  If it was going up for sale, you could get a huge bargain.  People ignored the police auction around here unless it was guns and cars.  The recent notices just said "office equipment." which was usually chairs, desks, beat-up fax machines, and the like.  Everything was as-is, and no refunds, so people weren't too eager to buy anything too complicated.

I found out that the police station was around the block.  That's why they checked that alley so often.  Making sure no one was getting stupid, thinking to get in and do whatever.

By this time, the Desk Sergeant already knew me and motioned me back to the property room.  He was pretty involved with a group of four angry... well, honestly, the way they were screaming?  Four angry "Karens."  I shook my head and kept moving.  They were going to get an education if they kept that up.  Sergeant Blohm had a long temper, but not *that* long.  Oh, they wouldn't be locked up unless they got totally bat-shit crazy, but Blohm has a way with words that would put a drill sergeant to shame.  No profanity.  No personalities.  Just plain facts stated clearly that made you realize just how stupid and ridiculous you were being.

I've been taking notes, but not today.  Today I'm on a mission.

"Hey!  If it isn't the Key Master's apprentice!  How you doing, Joe?"

"Not bad, *Gate Keeper*.  I hear you have something special going on sale?"

"That I do, gimme a sec."  He looked at his watch, and I checked the wall clock.  One second after noon.  Mark.  "And here it is."

Sales always start one second after the noon hour.  What he put up on the counter shocked me.  I'd been expecting a year or two old off-brand el cheapo.  This was a next-year bleeding edge near supercomputer.  The HAL 190, smart features out the yin yang, more memory than a top-of-the-line graphics machine, and disk space that might as well be infinite.  My eyes bugged out, then my face dropped.  Even at a police sale, I couldn't afford this.

"What's'a'matta'kid?"

"Officer Hanks?  Even at a police sale, I couldn't afford this.  It's beautiful, and I thank you for thinking of me, but I don't have that kind of money."

"That's what *you* think.  This computer has been taking up space for the last five years, and the captain wants it out of here pronto.  I think it spooks him somehow."

That didn't fit what I knew.  This thing was so new it should be sold dollar for dollar, but at five years, it went to a dime on the dollar.  "Officer Hanks?  That model doesn't go on sale until Christmas this year."

He shrugged, "I dunno.  I know the property ticket shows it's been here for five years, and the captain wants it gone."  He hesitated, then said, "Cap said to get rid of it pronto or smash it with my hammer.  I don't want to smash it, and I know you need it."

You know how the hero is supposed to get a feeling when *the moment of decision* arrives when he sets foot out on the grand adventure?  That something momentous has happened?  Well, it's a load of crock.  The only things I felt were lust for that computer, chagrin that I still had to spend most of my savings, and a devout hope that the original owner never came looking for it.

"I'll take it."

We completed the transaction, Hanks boxed it up, and I walked out of that station with a computer worth more than most of their salaries.

I felt like a master thief walking out of the museum with the crown jewels in a workman's lunch box.  Sergeant Blohm stared at me, looked at that box suspiciously, then saw me hold up the receipt from property.  He grinned and shooed me out the door.
