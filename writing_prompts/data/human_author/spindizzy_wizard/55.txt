"Welcome to... YOU!  GET OFF THIS LAND!  YOU ARE NOT..."

"Going to leave until we find you a way to survive without letting Beavier destroy more trees."

"I will not betray my lord."

"I would think less of you if you did, but we both know how he gets desperate, and what happens then?"

He's right.  Any land we did get would soon be stripped.  "What do you have in mind?"

"I have trustworthy *human* friends who can help us.  They can assess the lord's state.  That will allow us to make better plans.  In the meantime, how is everyone else doing?"

"We survive.  This Michael King is a demon!  He bought up every scrap of land in the world that money could... Oh.  That's you."

"Yes.  I've also ensured you can purchase syrup at half the going rate.  I'm glad that you took up that offer."

"But we... Oh.  Of course.  No one would admit it."  A deep sigh escapes. "Very well, we shall be guided by you."

Two humans move through the manor, escorted by a being they are unsure of.

"I hope he's unconscious."

"Me too."

*"Me three."* 

A startled snort from the humans and a high-pitched giggle break the macabre mood.

They reach the crypt.  Their escort unbars the door and enters.  The horrified gasp that follows almost sends them running, but the high-pitched shriek, *"Help Me!"* draws them in.

The scene is one of devastation.  Every wooden item in the crypt has been chewed into tiny chips.  The Lord of the manor still exists but is in obvious distress.

"Good Lord, he looks like a..."  His partner slaps him across the face.

"Don't say it.  Don't think it.  Just help us get him upstairs.  He needs a dentist badly."

Shamefaced, "I'm sorry."

••• 

The dental assistant, pale-faced, escorts the three into a private consultation office.  The oral surgeon follows in moments.

"Your *friend* has the worst case of overgrown central incisors I have ever seen.  I'm not happy with the lateral incisors, but I think I have to leave them.  Tell me if I'm right."

"You're right."

"My recommendation is that the central incisors, both upper and lower, are surgically removed.  We can replace them with posts that will leave a more natural-looking face but won't grow."

"That sounds good to us."

"Who's paying?"

••• 

"Lord Beavier, why did you not tell us!"

From a swollen face, "I'm sorry."

"Well, there are two things you need to know—first, no more wood chewing.  The replacements won't last the night.  Second, due to the swelling, and you have no choice in this, you will be drinking your meals from a straw.  The sugar maple king sends his regards, and suggests you try this for the straw."

A stout sugar maple branch, cleaned, bored, and ornately carved, with an attachment point on the thicker end is presented.

"The attachment is changeable.  This one is for use on trees.  It functions much like the taps that humans use, and ensures a good flow of sap.  The second one is for interior use, and fits the VeeVee standard shipping container fittings."

It's a weak protest, "I'll look stupid."

"My Lord, despite the situation, no one has left, and your newest spawn came back to ensure your safety.  We appreciate your care, but we have come to agree with Michael.  The days of drinking directly from the tree are over, unless the sap is running strong, and even then it will be a special treat rather than the norm.  Aside from this one issue, you have been an exemplary lord of the manor.  We beg you to consider this change as something necessary."

Growling, "Then we *all* use straws."

"Certainly, Lord."
