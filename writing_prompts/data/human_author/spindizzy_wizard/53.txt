The main door opens, and it seems someone inside beckons me to enter.  The light and flickering of fire guide me, but no one is there.  Strange.  Yet the fire is real, and I am soon warming by it.  My cloak is sodden with melting snow; I take it off and drape it around a stout chair in front of the fire.  I would like to have it added to my blanket for the night.  Soon, I am dry enough and warm to take an interest in my surroundings.

This place seems strangely familiar, yet I am sure I have never been here before.  A door in another wall swings open silently, and the odors wafting through it draw me in like a moth to a flame.  "What an odd analogy," I think, but I still enter.  The scent of food is strong, and I am hungry.

The food was good plain food.  The sort of food I remember from my youth and have craved ever since I left to carry those sad messages.  Little did I know where that journey would lead me, but I have returned and will deliver one last message to the Barkeep of Leads Vill.  It will be half a day late, but after missing it in this storm, I don't think he'll be upset.

Full of good food, I doze at the table.  In my mind's eye, I see gentle helpers guide me to a bedroom, well appointed and deliciously warm.  I am soon between sheets smelling of lavender and under a winter-weight comforter.

I sleep.

### In The Land Of Nod 

I am frightened.  I follow a party of older people.  Adventurers who hired me to take care of their pack train and riding horses while they are busy with whatever evil has taken residence in the wizard's tower.

They claim they seek good for all, but I am learning (the hard way) that what one claims is not always the truth.  Ah, Gran, you tried to warn me, but I'd already taken their coin, and yet, I sought something more from life than to follow in my parent's footsteps.

The older man with dead eyes falls back to my position.  "The barkeep is right.  What we do here is dangerous beyond your conception."  I would bridle at his words, but his dead eyes freeze my tongue, "whatever may befall us, you have not transgressed as we.  Clear your mind, forget us, and return to the Barkeep.  He will know what to do."

### Morning 

My eyes snap open.  I know where I am and what happened.  I am a mindless witless fool!  I throw on my clothes, not noticing their clean and dry state.  Diving down the tower stairs.  Driving myself to the main door.  I must get out!

I make it to the main entryway, but I am too late.  The hulking giant of a golem stands before the doorway, his dreadful maul already raised in a guard position.

I make my way steadily to the door.  "Let me pass, please?  I mean you no harm."  He stands at the door.  The other doors each slam shut, and I can hear them bar themselves.  With bleak determination, I prepare my meager spells.  I am but a journeyman mage-artificer.  I know I stand no chance against this entire fortress, but it is not in me to yield.

I stop.  And realize that I am standing in the middle of an arcane circle.  This cannot be purely chance, to place me here on the day that the powers of good are at their strongest.  The hall is filled with the servitors that the old mage constructed.  How could I have failed to notice them!?  Yet the guardian stands, weapon raised, blocking the door.  If I am to make a stand, this is the time and place.

### Leads Vill 

Martha calls out to me, "Leads!  Traveler approaching!"  I look up from my position in the line, clearing the snow from the square.  The roads must await those with the tools and time to clear them.

I see an oddly familiar young man, yet this one approaches with a smile and bright eyes.

"Ho!  Traveler!  What news!?"

He waves, a cheerful grin on his face.  As he comes closer, I see a sight I had thought we would never see again.    The old mage's servitors, shoveling snow, and that giant golem following behind.  ***Boom***, and his maul strikes, compacting the remaining snow and crowning the road in one mighty blow.

The entire vill is cheering.  I stand there, struck dumb.  He walks right up to me.  "Hello, You are the Barkeep are you not?"

I shake myself, "Yes, I am Leads, and the Barkeep."

"I am instructed to give you this message.  "My master sends his thanks from beyond for sending this boy to us so long ago.  He will be, in time, the master of the tower."  I have another message from my guild master.  "Our thanks for sending this pupil our way.  Your debt is cleared, and we find ourselves in your debt."  From the guild master of the man with the blades.  "Our thanks.  We do not believe that you will ever desire our services, but if you do, send this token with word."

That young man holds out a tiny silver dagger cupped in his hand.  I scoop it up and hide it before anyone else can get a good look.  Being owed a favor by the assassins guild is not a comforting thing.

"Finally," he continued, "despite all the good you have done for me, I ask one last boon.  May I approach you with problems I might take to my father?"

Martha touches my shoulder.  Gaining my attention, she nods.  She smiles that quiet smile, the one she uses when she *knows* something.  I look at that young man, and finally see what she has.  He could be me at that age.  I nod, not trusting my voice.

### Epilogue 

Yes, he was my sonâ€”an indiscretion before I met Martha.  The happy lass I met in the next vill over was an illegitimate child of the master of the tower.  Martha has taken to him as if he was her own.  Something tells me that she knows.
