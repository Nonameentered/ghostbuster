### Death Race 4000 

The rules seemed simple enough.

1. Last Driver across the finish line dies.
2. First Driver to die counts as (1).
3. You must use your starting vehicle as long as it can still move.
4. Sportsmanship does not apply.

What matters is the driver crossing the finish line, not the vehicle, except for rule (3).  A favorite method of ensuring survival is murder.  Rookies have an abysmal life expectancy.

This isn't about racing.  It's a combination execution for death sentences and revenue generator for the rest of the penal system.

And...

Despite its bloody awful effect on forming minds, it is one hell of a deterrent.

### The Rookie 

"You seen the new guy?"

"Yep.  Cocky little bastard isn't he."

"Word is, he's going down."

"Designated road kill?"

"Yep."

"I'll set this one out."  Reaching out with a monkey wrench, I smash my custom carb.

"Over a piece of shit like that?"

"I've got a feeling."

••• 

"Mr. Jones."

"Superintendent, what can I do for you?"

"You can join the race."

"Not until my new carb gets here, which will not be until the race is well underway.  I decline."

"You don't have a choice."

"Nothing says I have to take every race, and this is the first one I've missed in the last ten years."

"Very well.  You are a mainstay of these races.  People expect you to race.  The ratings have already dropped ten points."

I know the truth.  They watch because they want to see the Tallahassee Strangler die.  Still, the ratings pay for my gear.  "Superintendent, after the other racers are on the track, tell the viewers there's a special event this race.  The Strangler predicts there will be only one survivor."

His face goes pale.  "What have you done!?"

"I?  I have done nothing but ensure that I will not be in *this* race."

"It's the Rookie, isn't it?"

I said nothing, my stone face in place.  He swore and stomped off.  There wasn't much else he could do.  The new guy was already announced.  Rookies tend to die fast, which draws ratings.  With me already out, he couldn't pull the Rookie without answering questions from higher.

Sucks to be you, Super.

"It's Race Day, Folks!"

"Yes it is, Don!  And we can confirm the following rumors for you.  The Tallahassee Strangler's car experienced a *technical fault*, so he will not be in this race."

"Well, Mike, you can dress it up as a *technical fault* or you can admit he smashed a custom carb with a wrench rather than be in this race."

"Now, Don, that is another rumor!"

"No rumor, Mike." Reaching below his desk, he sets the busted carb on his desk.  A camera zooms in, the impact marks are clear. "He sent that to us with a note."

"Don!  What's the note say?!"

"The Strangler claims there will be only one survivor from today's race!"

"He knows something.  I don't know how, but he knows something and doesn't want any part of it."

"I say he's bluffing, covering his sorry sick ass cowardice!"

"The Strangler is one sick bastard, alright, but he's never been a coward in these races.  Something changed.  Some new factor is in play, and that leads us straight to the next official confirmation."

"That's right, Mike.  There is a Rookie!  We have a new driver!  He's convicted of over fifty murders, and has chosen the name Assassin!  Let's hear it for our new Driver!"

> Cut to Assassin intro video, two minutes of commercials, and the other half of the intro.

"And that's Assassin.  A cold blooded murderer for hire."

"Too bad he's not going to make it through this race alive, eh Don?"

"Mike, did you forget your meds, again?  Assassin is the new factor.  He's going to survive while everyone else dies."

"A newbie!?  What have you been smoking, Don?  Our fans would love to know!"

Don is a known drug abuser, who has been clean for the last five years.  It's still a sore point for him.

"Mike?  Have you stopped beating your wife?"

"I don't have a wife."

"That's right!  I forgot you're here for liking your ladies way too young.  Can't get it up with anything mature."

Mike is a pederast.  Only he's just been caught, again, and is on his last warning.  One more fuckup, of any magnitude, and he's the next rookie.

> *Commercial!  Go to commercial!*  One minute later.  Both of them are smiling.  Forced smiles, but they are smiling and back on script for the race.

Jointly, "Let the Race Begin!"
