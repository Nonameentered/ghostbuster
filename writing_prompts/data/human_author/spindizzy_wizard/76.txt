### Xchtitle Library 
#### Story Time 
##### Speaker: T. Jones 

> Humans are the greatest warriors in the galaxy!

Librarian Jones answers calmly.  "Yes, we used to be warriors.  Wars do not make you great.  They may make you famous, infamous, dreaded, or lionized.  Sometimes all of them at the same time.  Most of the time, wars make you dead."

> You were the best warriors in the galaxy!

He's a bit less calm now.  This could go wrong, fast.  "Some of us, yes.  Others were the worst, and not that they were incompetent, but they were unnecessarily brutal."

> Don't you appreciate your history?  Your accomplishments?  Your legacy?

That hits a nerve, Jones' voice is an icy hiss.

"Let me tell you about our legacy."

••• 

"Admiral!  Please!  We cannot evacuate within the time limit!  We have prioritized children and pregnant women, but this facility is a *Maternity Hospital*, there are simply too many patients!"

Coldly, "You should have thought of that before you accepted rebel wounded."

"REBEL WOUNDED!?  THOSE ARE CIVILIAN FEMALES YOUR TROOPS RAPED!"

"They came from a rebel held zone, in vehicles marked with the rebel icon.  Ergo, they are rebels and you and all your staff are traitors.  You should be glad I permitted you time to evacuate anyone.  Comm!  End Call!"

The call is cut.  The hospital administrator grabs a microphone.

"NO EXTENSION! BOMBARDMENT IMMINENT! TAKE COVER!"

The next view is from the outside, and at some distance.  A brilliant pinpoint of light appears above the hospital.  The light swells until it engulfs the entire facility.  The blast wave from the unnecessarily massive ordinance scours the valley bare.  The first vehicle of the evacuation convoy is shredded and goes through the pass like a shotgun blast.

There are no survivors.

••• 

A tiny voice...

> That cannot be the only legacy.  Can't there be a happy story?

Relenting, Jones begins a new tale.

••• 

"Alpha Six, Alpha Echo Three Six!  We have found survivors!"

"Echo Three, Alpha Six.  Evacuate immediately!  Enemy forces are pushing the line back!"

"Six, Echo Three.  No can do!  Many wounded.  Is transport available?"

"Echo Three, Six Actual.  Sorry, Toby.  All transport that could reach you is already fully tasked.  Suggest you withdraw with whomever you can take.  The enemy has declared no quarter."

"Jason, It's a grade school.  All we have are ourselves, three surviving teachers, and several hundred kids.  If they aren't wounded, they're shell shocked."

"Toby, I'm sorry for them, but there isn't a blessed thing I can do for them.  I urge you to withdraw."

"Wait!  Jason, take a look at the topo for this place!  Think!  Wouldn't it make a great redoubt?"

There is silence for a long time.

"Echo Three, Alpha Six!  Hold what you got!"

Drawing on a projected display.  Jones shows how the defenders deliberately collapsed their lines to draw the enemy into following them to the school.  The terraced terrain lent itself to multiple defensive lines, the school being nearly a bunker since it was adapted from an early colonial structure when the planet still held many threats.

Waves of enemies break on that redoubt, which holds out for six months.  The siege finally lifted by off planet reinforcements who assaulted the besiegers via vertical development.

Drop commandos, the elite of the elite.

Arriving as flaming stars from orbit, when they hit, a demoralized enemy fractures into small units seeking only escape from the disease riddled camp.

Not a single child was lost.

••• 

> See!  You humans *are* the greatest warriors!

While the comment is laudatory, the tone is derisive.

"Come up here and say that to my face!"  Jones has lost his composure. "Come on!"

A xeno steps forward.

"Identify yourself!"

"Sergeant Diz Rey Speck, Third Army, Gaxyrtine Empire."

"Third army... It was the Third that broke and ran at Second Dyson.  It was Third that slaughtered prisoners at Fifth Casseime.  It was Third that turned cannibal at First Kilkenny.  It was Third that took helpless civilians prisoner, and used them as meat shields at Runeymead.  Do you know where the Fifth Infantry Division, Earth Federation, was at each of those?"

"You covered our backs."

"Do you know *why* we did?"

"Orders."

"Bullshit.  We did it because *our families* were held hostage by the Federation.  Runneymead was the last straw.  We staged an op, recovered our families, **glassed** Earth, and destroyed the Federation. Do you know why we did that?"

"Tired of being used like the wimps you are?"

"No.  The next operation would have been to destroy the Empire.  The same Empire that decimated the Third for desertion and war crimes, not once, not twice, but four times.  The same Empire that thanked us for bringing word of your cowardice, excesses, and incompetence; for ensuring the Empire continued to exist.  Care to guess our greatest regret?"

"Destroying your strongest government?"

"Nope.  That the Empire would not let us execute the lot of you, as the cowards you were, and still are."

Speck started it, but Jones finished it in a half-second display of unarmed combat that left Speck dead on the library floor.  Apparently of internal bleeding.

Jones looked down at the body.  The library is quiet as a tomb.  Jones is breathing hard, but slowly, oh so slowly, relaxes.

"I'm sorry you had to see that.  But maybe it is for the best.  This is why we gave up war.  So far, there isn't a single oxygen breathing species that can stand against us in unarmed combat.

"What honor is there in defeating an enemy who has no chance?

"What glory is there in fighting battles that you know you cannot lose?

"How do you tell your employers that they've won the war, but lost their planet?

"No.  There is no honor or glory in combat.  Not for humans."

He stands there a bit longer, while servitors come and remove the body.

Looking up, his face lights up with a smile, "How about the story of The Princess Bride?"

The massed cheers of children and adults rattles the windows.  It is a favorite tale, and the students of Redoubt School love the way Jones tells it.
