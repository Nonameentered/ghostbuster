As a confirmed member of the Gaian Church, your beliefs are as far from technology as it is possible to be (a personal choice influenced by your great grand aunt's dedication to Gaia.)

As a technology researcher, you are as far from nature as you can get (a stipulation of your inheritance from your great grand uncle, brother of your aunt.)

In your latest research, disaster strikes, threatening everything you have been working towards.

In desperation, you pray to Gaia for aid, and she answers.
