Strongly suggest you get Reddit app for your phone.  Using browser is not recommended.  Browser implementation on phones miss a lot of capabilities.  Web sites never work quite the way you expect on phones unless the devs have wizard blood in their veins.  Very rare.

Also suggest using markdown mode in Reddit app because you have a better chance of getting the formatting you expect.

Fancy editor mode would be nice, but I've never had anything but grief using it.
