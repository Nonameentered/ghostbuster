I was fully mobile from that day forward.  A few specialists came by, and one wild-eyed surgeon wanted to open me up again.

"No."

"But..."

"I said, No, doctor.  You'll have to make do with the imaging done."  Could you believe he pouted?  "Doc, you are not nearly cute enough to pull that look off as anything other than a bad joke."  He grinned.

"Hey?  I wouldn't know until I tried.   You mind?"

Actually, I did mind, but when he wasn't being a knife-happy pest, he was downright charming.

"Well, how about this?  We've got a project to study human healing and how we can improve it.  I think you'd be perfect for it."

Okay, charming or not, there was no way I wanted to be a guinea pig forever.  I wanted a contract with a specified period and no weasel wording.

I mean, I'm not a *totally* self-centered bastard.  I could see how this would improve everyone's life.  But I wanted...

What did I want?

How did I end up here in the first place?

For that matter, where was *here*?

I had more questions than answers, and Doctor Charming turned into Mister Hyde.  I was already part of the study, and as much as they would have preferred my willing cooperation, they didn't feel constrained by not having it.

I was told cooperation would benefit me, but my insistence on knowing the benefits before I cooperated annoyed them.

"Fine.  You've got me."  And yes, there were benefits, but the price was too damned high.  I took the extra payment out of them by insisting all the support people who worked with me were treated courteously.

The doctors and senior staff may have hated my guts, but the nurses, physical therapists, janitors, and all the rest of the support staff loved me.

Since I wasn't ready to commit murder (yet!) I stuck it out.

They finally made a fatal mistake.

"Damn, he's flatlined."

"Resuscitate?"

"No.  We haven't learned anything from our tests this last year that we didn't already know."

"Yes.  Doctor."

That first voice was Doctor Charming in Hyde mode.

The second voice was that first nurse that I insisted be treated courteously.  I was struck by how much hatred she could put into her last reply.  Hyde didn't even notice.  Once he left the OR, I let my body rouse to full life again.

"Easy, Nurse Pink.  And don't call out.  Mr. Hyde just gave me my walking papers."

"You.  You're immortal?"

"Seems so, but I'd rather not push it any further.  I *was* clinically dead, yes?"

"Yes, you were.  No brain function, no heartbeat, you don't get much deader than that."

"Okay.  That means I'm off Hyde's radar.  It's time to start figuring out how to bust out of this place.  What I want to know is who can we trust and who wants to come along."

We talked while she finished disconnecting me from the test rig.  The first thing to go was the biosensors.  It wouldn't do for Hyde to stop back in and see activity.

I finally decided that there was no viable way to take anyone with me unless we shut this place down *hard*—smoking hole in the ground hard.

Depending on the available materials, that was doable...  How the hell did I know that?

"I saw you when you were brought in.  You were wearing a Navy uniform.  A Senior Master Chief and your tunic had an imprint on it.  The Trident."

"I was a SEAL?  How did I end up here?"

She didn't know.  It had been her first day on the job, and she hadn't found out just how tight security was either.

When I came in, I was nearly-dead cube steak.  The old saw said, "Not quite dead is a little bit alive."  They put me through treatments she'd never seen before, and I survived.

The subsequent years were one experiment after another, trying to figure out the secret of my healing.

By now, I was pretty sure Hyde knew the secret but couldn't quantify it.  He made me this way and had enough clout to drag people in like this.  Bad combo and not legal under any laws I knew.  That made this a black op.  Which branch of the government was it?

As long as it wasn't Intel, like the CIA, we had a chance.  Shops like the CIA were perfectly willing to kill everyone, and say "what secret hospital? We are an intelligence agency, not the NIH."

Anyone else might have a few scruples left.

Location was another issue, but Nurse Pink (Yes, a code name.  I'm not stupid.) could narrow it down to somewhere in the North West.  From the mountains, it could have been Idaho or Montana.

I need time to flesh out the next part.
