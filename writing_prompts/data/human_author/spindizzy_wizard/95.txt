Through mischance, one young boy is exposed to that chemical; a powerful carcinogen.  It seeps into his body and lies quietly, almost dormant, but not quite.  Cells are mutated.  Begin to spread, and as he grows, they spread through his body.  Soon, they are everywhere and begin to grow uncontrolled.

"You see?  There *was* a cause, but no human detected it.  Who is responsible for that boy's state?

"The owners of the plant?  They did everything they knew to do.  What's more, and quite different from *most* involved in the industry, they went *beyond* the basic requirements.  They insisted on an impermeable clay barrier.

"The workers who installed the clay barrier?  None of them had any idea there was a bit of porous material.  Had they known, they had contingency plans to rip out anything suspect and replace it.

"The staff?  They reacted with such speed and accuracy that what *could* have been a major incident was honestly believed to be mitigated with no possibility of exposure outside the plant.

"The inspectors?  They tested the creek and found no trace because there was no trace to find.  The water level was at a high seldom seen.

"The mother?  The issues did not even begin to show up until he had moved out to start his life.

"The young man?  He saw doctor after doctor as each tested for what they knew and sent him onward when they found their knowledge lacking.  Not that it would have made the slightest difference in his ultimate fate, the cancer was already too widespread."

I stop, allowing the court to absorb this information.  To ask the thousand and one questions, would *this* not have helped?  No, it would not have, and this is why.

"So, we continue."  In a slow-motion way, this death is as brutal as anything on a battlefield.  A young man, clinging tenaciously to life, contributing so much to society in such a short time, although few would know of it while he lived.  The pain meds grew ever stronger as his reserves ran lower and lower.  Finally, in one last lucid moment, the young man who had lived with ever-increasing pain for another six years says, "Please, no more."

I enter the picture.  He sleeps.  I can see that he will die within minutes, screaming in agony.  Breaking the fourth wall, my past self speaks to the audience, "to those of you watching from the future; I stay my hand.  Judge for yourself whether it would be better to act now or later."

The view splits.  On one side, my scythe sweeps, and a soul, only tenuously held, slips easily free of a body that is a burden.  His face smoothes out, a peaceful smile.

On the other, his face contorts.  Anguish is the least emotion shown.  On a deeper plane, we see the soul screaming, "WHY?"  In mercy, I can stay my hand no longer.  The scythe sweeps, but... The difference in the result!

The body adopts a rictus of pain.  The soul is twisted into an unnatural shape.  The nurse comes under suspicion of mistreatment; a good nurse lost to remorse despite the fact she did everything right.  A cascade of unnecessary painful deaths as people react to the agony on the corpse, denying the validity of pain management.  The consequences roll on through time, but the real damage is already done.  That young man's soul never recovers.  A beautiful life lost in a storm of recrimination, his grand contribution ignored.

I stop.  I wait for the court to recover.  It takes time, and many ask me if it was necessary to put that young man through such pain.  I reassure them.  This was a recreation of what would have been, not what is.  Some are too angry with me for not intervening earlier.  I ask them to wait.

"Your Honor, I would poll the entire court with your permission.  Should I have taken that young man's soul when I did, or should I have waited?  Was what I did murder or mercy?  Did I act as a cold-blooded murderer or as the final friend in your most dire need?"

The prosecutor asks, "He was already dead, wasn't he?"

"In the first choice, I acted at the very moment his mortal remains became a hostile environment destroying any soul connected to it.  Did his heart still beat?  Yes.  Was his brain still what your doctors would consider viable?  Barely.  Was there anything that could have been done to save him?  Not by me or anyone other than the Creator.  If you wish for a further answer, I can only suggest that you find a way to ask the Creator."

The entire court comes to the only sane conclusion.  I may have ended his life, but his life was already over.  All I did was release him from a body no one would choose to remain in.

"Those are the vast majority of my cases.  Most of those die without my personal intervention, the separation of the soul from the body being a natural effect of a body that can no longer support life.

"Yet what of the case where the soul can no longer support life?  What of the body?"
