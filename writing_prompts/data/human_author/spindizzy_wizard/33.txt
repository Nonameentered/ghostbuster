"It's the King!   It's the King!" My wife is losing her mind—time to put my foot down.

"Calmly, Martha.  We are a simple inn.  We provide good simple food that everybody says is the best they've tasted."

"He's the King!  We have to serve him our very best!  I'll get the pewter out!"

"No, Martha.  We will serve him the same meal we serve everyone else, exactly the same way."

"But... But... He could RUIN US!"

"No, Martha.  I spoke with a driver who was at Dalilah's place last season.  She went for the pewter and high cooking that we both know she was no good at.  That is what ruined her.  We will **not** make that mistake."

"But you are better at high cooking!"

"And who knows that?  The King?  I doubt it.  If you're that worried, I'll talk with the king myself.  Find out what he's looking for.  How does that sound?"

"He's the King!  Remember to bow!"

"And I am the Chef.  I bow to no man in my place!"

Put a stop to this nonsense at once.  "Good even, our regular meal is roast lamb, potatoes, gravy, fresh bread, you can have drippings, or for a bit extra, we have freshly churned butter.  All served on a bread trencher."

"Good man, do you have the slightest idea who I am?"

"Yes, I do.  The man who wants to taste my best meal, and not something I've tried to knock together in a panic at the last moment."

The entire inn holds its breath until...

"Good for you!  I'll have exactly that!"

After a beautiful meal of the typical food for this inn, the King asks to speak with the Chef.

"Yes, Your Majesty?"

"I compliment you on your good sense, your good food, and your good wife who made certain that no one lacked for anything."

"Thank you, Your Majesty."

"I would like to challenge you.  If you agree, and there will be no penalty for not agreeing, I will return on a night you specify to try your best high cooking.  The meal would be private, and the results would be strictly between you and I.  What do you say?"

"I would have to ask for payment in advance; I cannot afford the ingredients for such a meal otherwise.  Nor would I ever want the results to become common knowledge."

"Agreed.  Here are 30 gold florins.  What you do not spend, you may keep."

"Then you may return in a fortnight, and I will have a meal ready for you."

"Good!"

••• 

"YOU TOOK HIS CHALLENGE!?"

"Yes, Martha."

"YOU IDIOT!  MORON!  FOOL!  OUR REPUTATION WAS MADE!  NOW WE ARE AT RISK AGAIN!"

"That's enough, Martha.  There are things you are not aware of."

"LIKE WHAT!"

Holding out the purse, "Like the 30 gold florins paid in advance, of which we can keep what we do not spend."

"*thirty gold florins?*"

"Yes."

"We should flee now!"

"No.  I gave my word."

"Your word!  You'll see us ruined yet!"

"Wife?  Are you happy being married to me?"

"Once, I was."

"What changed?"

"We grew old together, but our hearts grew apart.  We could make more of ourselves, but you seem content here.  I long for something different."

"Then calm yourself.  This meal is the test of my abilities.  The King has sworn to keep the results secret regardless of the outcome.  Good or Ill, none will ever know."

"If we fail, that is good, but why would we not want anyone to know if we succeed?"

"Because I will not make my way in the world on the back of one man's reasonable opinion.  I would rather have the confidence that people come to my inn because it is the best food for the best value.  That way, a falling out with one man is not a disaster.  Everyone knows that I provide good food here.  Even if the king turned his nose up at it, our regular custom would still be here.  We would survive his disfavor.  But.  If we go to a city and open an inn on the reputation of the King.  We will only have that custom that follows the whims of one man.

"Far better if we go to the city and make our reputation.  Succeed or fail; I will know it was our doing."

"I... I very much hope we go to the city.  I would like to see it."

••• 

For the price of three florins, a kingly meal is produced.  The King waxes enthusiastic, "I can spread the word..."

"No, Your Majesty.  You agreed, for good or ill, none would know the result of this challenge."

"You do not wish my assistance?"

"Not in the matter of reputation. However, if your Senechal would correspond with me, I would find his assistance in locating a suitable location for a higher-class inn desirable."

••• 

"We are not moving?"

"I think not.  After conferring with the Senechal, it seems that the custom along this road is going to expand massively.  We can rebuild the inn, have finer fittings, and provide at least two different meals per day.  One of our common fare, and one high fare for those with money to burn."

"I was so looking forward to seeing the city."

"That, we can and must still do.  We will have to travel a bit to see what is available for our new inn."

•••

And so they do.  Martha, who has never traveled, is both amazed at the sights and sounds, as well as dismayed by the conditions one suffers through while traveling.

••• 

"John?  I have an idea."

### J&M Coach Inn 

"Woah!  Woah!  All out!  We are done moving for the day!  Welcome to the J and M Coach Inn, rooms and dining for all!"

One snooty lady from the coach, "I highly doubt that you have any provender suitable for a Lady."

"Would you like to bet on that?"

Sniff!  "Certainly not!"

"Your loss then..."

"What do you mean?"

"If there is no meal suitable for a lady, in the opinion of your companions, your fare is refunded."

"And if there is?  Not that there is, but..."

"Then you tell everyone how good your meal was."

"That's all?"

"Dear Lady, your words on how good our food is, is worth gold florins to us."

"You're on!"

"Good!  My husband is the Chef!"

••• 

And so, a reputation was saved.  A skill confirmed.  A lady got to travel, and a husband got to stay.  How they managed to have six children is a mystery.
