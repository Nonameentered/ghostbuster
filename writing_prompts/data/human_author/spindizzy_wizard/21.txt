### The Message
The Arecibo message is an interstellar radio message carrying basic information about humanity and Earth that was sent to globular star cluster M13 in 1974. It was meant as a demonstration of human technological achievement, rather than a real attempt to enter into a conversation with extraterrestrials.

"Professor?  Listen to this?"

The eerie sound of a signal wavering between two frequencies.  It's nothing like a human signal in common use anywhere.  It's also nothing like any known natural phenomenon.  The signal repeats many times, with 1,679 bits in each repetition.

Per protocol, SETI sent the notices for an unknown signal after two repeats, hoping that someone else might catch at least part of it, giving a chance of locating the origin.

Soon enough, confirmations came in from around the world, usually couched in less than complimentary terms.

> I know your funding got cut, but faking a signal is stupid.

That sort of stupidity got pointed right back at the idiot who said it.

> If we could afford to fake a signal that the whole world could triangulate on, which you obviously didn't bother doing, we wouldn't need to fake it for money.  Something I'm sure you are comfortable doing.

Although they may have gone too far.

"1679 bits... Why is that so familiar?"

The intern, a bit fanatical about contacting aliens knew, "The Arecibo message was that length.  The product of 23 Ã— 73, both prime numbers."

"Damn, then it's human after all."

"No, Sir.  There is nothing human in the general direction it came from, and nothing that far out."

"I assume you've already set it up visually?  Let's see it."

Aside from the pseudo helix confirming a similarity between the two messages, nothing makes sense.  Not even the supposedly standard element weights.

"Professor?  Do you see anything?"

"No, but I'm not a linguist."
