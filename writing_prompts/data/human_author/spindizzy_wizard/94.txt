I shift from the well-known world of these people to a world of deprivation and starvation.  To a young lady, although you could never tell that from her body without a close examination.  Starvation has done its work, and her clothes are androgynous.  In many ways, this is a blessing.  Those who got enough sustenance underwent the change and were savagely abused by their masters.  She has escaped that much, but not the grinding toil.  The constant abuse that all suffer.  The utter lack of hope that anything could change her state.

"I ask you now, is there anything that could change her state?"

Their answers were many and varied.  These are, for the most part, good people.  They feel the suffering of the ones they can see but seldom think of those they cannot.  It's understandable.  They have their lives to live.  Yet they think back now to snippets of news they did not consider.  To requests for aid from well-known compassionate organizations.  Many gave and frequently do, but more do not.  Would that five dollars you spend on a beer, or a packet of cigarettes, be so missed if you sent it to someone in need?  They think these things themselves; I only see what they share with others.  The regret at not forgoing a minor pleasure to help those in greater need.

I regret to inform them of this, "There was nothing anyone here could do.  No amount of money would have reached her.  No one would have come to her aid.  Why?  Because it is the authorities of that place, who treat her so.  According to their laws, she is a criminal; although she is far too young to have committed any crime, her very existence is seen as a crime.  That's right.  Her *existence* is her crime.  Her mother cared for her as best she could until she was killed by accident by a police officer conducting a search when she attempted to hide her daughter from his sight.  His proclivities were well known, and she would have been a prime target for that officer.

"As a result of her mother's death, the officer was investigated and executed for his proclivities.  The child... Well... she shouldn't have existed.  She was an affront to society and its ideals.  Thus, she was punished.  Oh, that was never the stated intent, but it is what happened."

Her life is compressed, showing the unending turmoil.  Finally, a kinder master takes over, and more food is provided.  She finally gets enough food, and soon enough, her body can continue to mature.  She will be phenomenally beautiful.  The new master notices this and does his best to get her out of that facility before it shows.  Getting her education, which she soaks up readily.  Getting her interviews, items for grooming, doing everything he can to improve her life.

To both their misfortunes.

He?  He is found guilty of financial irregularities.  The facility is costing far more than it should.  Obviously, he is pocketing the money.  His records showing the state of the prisoners before his arrival and after he raises their rations are discounted, as are productivity increases and a reduction in anti-social behavior.  You see, none of them should have existed.  They were all guilty of the same crime.  Spending more money on them was seen as a worse crime than embezzlement.

She?  She is sold off to another facility to recoup the money spent and return it to the facility she came from.  Many others are sold the same way.  This is not "slavery" to this society; it's indentured servitude.  Never mind that the pay is pitiful, seldom handed over, and everything is overpriced.  The proper term is debt peonage.  They have virtually no chance of escape, and those few who do are unusually fortunate to have slipped out of the authority's grasp before they are discovered.

This new facility caters to a more depraved mindset.  One that she has no experience with other than twice-told tales.  One that the executed police officer would have understood all too well and been delighted to afford the prices this place requires.  Legally, she is an adult.  Mentally and emotionally, she is not.   In brutal clarity, the court is made to understand the conditions under which she exists.  Now, her existence is too much even for her to bear, but suicide is not allowed.  She is chained, and the abuse goes on, and on, and on...

"Please, no more!"

Her current *client* laughs in her face and continues his activities.  I arrive in answer to her plea.  The body is still sound, but the soul has given up ownership of the body.  She is adrift within a sea of degradation and abuse.  My scythe sweeps, and she is gathered to my side.  Free at last from this mortal coil.  Her body continues, an automaton with nothing of humanity but the mortal husk.  I escort her to her new abode, where she is cleansed of the evil done to her and granted a time in peace.  She knows that sooner or later, she will be reborn, and she hopes for a better life.

The court is quiet.  They have seen things that they cannot unsee.  Their lives are forever changed.  "I ask the court.  Was that murder or mercy?"

Without any exceptions, they proclaim mercy.

"Even though her body could and did continue to live?"

Yes.

"Even though she could have survived?"

Yes.

"Even though it was her choice to die?"

Yes.

"Is she guilty of anything?"

There is some argument whether this counted as suicide, which some see as a crime.  The majority see it as nothing of the sort.  She took no action; she simply chose not to continue to live under those conditions.  That she succeeded without external assistance is sufficient for them to say not suicide, but they know they're lying to themselves.

"Even the good, innocent people can be driven beyond their limits."

···

"I ask this court for dismissal.  A trial of those over whom I watch has already decided that I am not a murderer."

"This court feels that it has no right to judge this individual.  What many of you missed was the anguish he watched those earlier lives, including the people who bore some responsibility for the events.  In all cases, there was a sense of regret that he could not do more, but he is as constrained by those above him as I am by the law and the expectations that I will do my duty.

"In this case, I have no choice.  The case is dismissed.  Mr. Reaper, if you are grim, it is with more cause than most of us can possibly absorb.  You take no pleasure in your actions, only satisfaction in a job well done.  If this court can be of assistance, please do not hesitate to come before us and ask.  We may be able to act, we may not, but you *will* be heard."

"I thank you."

That one person.  The one who refused to see "It's a Beautiful Life" finally acts.  An explosive device, concealed within the room before that one came, only that one carries the detonator.  The explosion destroys all possibility of life among all attendants on this court.  The others are all gathered immediately, free of their bodies.  I ask that court for a verdict for the one who triggered the explosion.  They all scream guilty and ask that this one be left in place, to suffer.  "Have you learned nothing?"  I sweep again, taking the soul of that one.  "It is not left to me to judge their acts.  That is for a higher power.  Nor may you impose punishment, for this realm is not under your power.

"I AM DEATH!

"Bringer of release when the pain is too great.

"Do not fear me.

"Do not seek me out.

"We will find each other when the time is right."
