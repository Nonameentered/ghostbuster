### Laser Fingers 

Yeah, sure.  If I'm stupid enough, I can crank the power up and blow nearly anything to hell.  But why would I?  That's destructive, and while I do spend a bunchaton of time cutting things apart, it's welding them together that's the most enjoyable.

Besides, I'm important here.  I can get into places no one else can because I don't have to drag welding gear.  That makes me ideal for fixing shit that the bots miss or the engineers didn't think of.

It also makes me essential personnel for collapsed building rescue.

"Tony!  Fifth Avenue!  The Dagwood building!"

"There's no big steel, just a core with reinforced concrete.  What do they need me for?"

"The rubble keeps shifting, and they've located a pocket with about a hundred people.  They got air to them, but clearing a way to get out isn't working."

Something twanged in my mind.  "Did the core collapse?"

Harry nods yes.  That should not have happened.  "Tell them I'm on my way.  Standard reinforcement package had better be on site when I get there."

Harry yells for his assistant.  It's one of the reasons I like working for him.  He's got his head on straight.

••• 

At Dagwood, it's a madhouse.  Heroes are standing around sucking their thumbs.  Three of them, I know, could have cleared the debris and had those people out of danger in seconds.  What the hell is going on?

"If you guys are here, what do they need me for?"

Shield answers for them, "the building collapsed because someone mined the core.  There are still live charges.  We've already determined that the fuzes include anti-tamper keyed to our powers.  We can't use our normal methods."

I nodded.  It's a pain in the ass when the villains pull shit like this.  "Is my reinforcement package here?"

"Yes, Tony.  But we think if he planned for us, he probably planned for you.  You normally use iron reinforcement, don't you?"

"Yes, it's the easiest to work with and the least expensive with the strength."

"Could you work with aluminum?"

"Not strong enough.  Aircraft alloys might work, but I've never tried welding them.  They can be tricky.  How sure are you that the core was mined?"

"We found one device.  The way it collapsed says it was deliberate."

"Anyone call the bomb squad?"

"Didn't see the need."

I walk away and start calling.  "Jack?  How likely do you find a deliberate implosion of Dagwood?"

*"Deliberate?  Not a chance.  I'm looking at the device they pulled out. It's antipersonnel, not demo.  The collapse pattern is all wrong for an implosion as well."* 

"Thanks, Jack.  Any magnetic triggers on that device?"

"None."

"We still on for Friday ?"

"Yep.  Beer is chilling and the cards are hot."

"See you then!"

I turn back to the heroes.  "We go with the standard reinforcement package.  Jack says no magnetic trigger, the device was antipersonnel, and the collapse is wrong for a deliberate implosion."  There are some disgruntled looks.  "It's my life on the line, and I trust Jack to get it right."

They can eat it raw for all I care.  They come in and do shit that isn't safe or right, depending on their powers to bull through.  I'm the expert at this, not them, and I trust the experts I consult, whether they're "Heroes" or not.  Us "heroes" (little h) are just as good as them, even if we do work for a living.

((cut to a scene of dirty but happy people crawling out of a tunnel crudely reinforced by rebar and steel plates joined with precise and careful welds.))

Tony walks up to the Heroes and hands the leader a chunk of concrete with one bit of rebar sticking out of it.

"It wasn't a deliberate implosion.  It was shoddy construction and skimping on materials.  Less than half the rebar required by code is present.  Whoever set off that explosive paid for it with their lives.  I found this when I found the body."

Handing the leader a sigil they all knew well.

"Damn.  Those things were grenades.  He threw one at us when we were chasing him."

I got no time for their anguish.  There are other survivors, and I'm their only hope.  Then I gotta go back to work.  I don't charge for this, just the materials, and I still got a family to feed.

### The Electrician 

"Robert!  You're needed at Alameda Power One!"

"On it, Mom!"

Yeah, I'm The Electrician.  I can span a network through its wires and find problems with pinpoint accuracy.  Maybe I could do other things, but I'm still in school!

I stick my probe into the outlet and zing my way to Alameda Pown.  Piece of crap station, they should sue the people who did the wiring.  Oh, that's right!  They can't sue.  Because they'd be suing themselves.  Well, it's easy money.

Huh.  Blocked at Diego Sierra Five.  I call that in.  The word comes back that it's being worked on.

"Yeah, *after* I called it in."

*"Well, what did you expect?  You've made life easy for them."* 

"So?  You want me to quit?  I'd have more time for fun."

*"Not on your life!  I like having my lights back on in minutes instead of hours!"* 

"It would go faster if they would bother to check the master board."

*"The what?"* 

"The master board.  You know!  The one with all the nodes listed and with controls that not only show the state, but let you change the state.  I figured that was how you knew there was a problem at Alameda Pown."

*"Robert.  There is no such board."* 

"Sure there is!  In the basement of...*click*..."  What?   Did he just hang up on me?  *Thud*  The power is out?

Whispered, "Oh, fuck me."

A new voice, gruff, but not unkind, just behind him.  "Sorry, kid, just business."
