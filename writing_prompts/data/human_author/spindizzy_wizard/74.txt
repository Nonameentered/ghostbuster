It is counter to my purpose.

I am the relief of pain when life becomes an unbearable burden.

Yet this individual.  This bright light of life.  Speaks to me in ways that no other being has ever achieved.

I will not ask that this cup be taken from me because I know it will never be taken.  I am made to drink the cups of tears.  It is what I do.

Not this time.

A fool nearly runs the child down.  The fool dies.  A good thirty years before their time, but there is no consequence.  The fool had no purpose but to run that child down.

A criminal thinks to invade the young adult's home, thinking that it must be a rich person to be so happy all the time.  The criminal is intercepted by the policeman who would have diverted to a coffee shop, but I made sure that didn't happen.  The young adult lives on without knowing how close they came to death.

I am punished.  Pain fills my being.  Pain is something I am intimately familiar with.  It can be overridden, and I do so without effort.

An adult in their prime, spreading joy and happiness wherever they go.  It has a profound effect on the world.  Assassins are sent, and each dies.  I kill them myself.  I will not allow this font of good to be destroyed, not even if the creator mandates it.

Older now, slower to move, yet still full of a quiet joy that fills the cold spaces they move through.  People are always happier after this still brilliant life passes by, and they add their happiness to the sum of the world.

Aged and bedridden, they still have such joy in life that I hesitate to take them.  I decide to speak with them directly.

"Do you know who I am?"  I ask gently.

They turn their head to me and open their eyes.  "Yes, I know who you are.  You are the one who kept me in this body for decades.  I would curse you with my last breath if I could.  Every year that I lived on, the pain grew worse, and still, you would not come.  At first, I didn't understand, but I continued and finally saw why.  You kept me alive because I made people happy.  Did you ever wonder if I was happy?  Did you ever consider the source of my gift?  No.  You did not.  I curse you now.  You will never know joy again.  You will have your duty and take pride in a well-done job, but you will never smile again.  Not until you have suffered a thousand times what you have inflicted on me."

As they wished to curse me with their last breath, I swept my scythe and took their soul.  "I will bear your pain, and do so with a grin, because I have already suffered with you for the last 60 years.   The creator saw fit to punish me, and I bore it willingly.  You cannot fool me; you took joy in helping others to happiness.  So did I.  You smiled because they did.  You laughed and lived your life to the hilt!  Showing others how it is done.  I can do no less."

"Eat!  Drink!  And be Merry!  For tomorrow you may die!  And if you do not?  Smile, for I have eaten and drunk with you, to the dregs of the barrel, and I have never regretted it!  My grin is proof of that.  And should we meet in the dark, show me your grin, for I will bear it throughout eternity and beyond."
