It wasn't the hotel.  It was the police station and ended up burning the whole block.  I got to the store, or where it had been, and found Mr. Wilson standing there with an attractive lady.  She got him to look at me without being obvious, and his face lit up with a smile.

"You okay, Mr. Wilson?"

"Now that I know you aren't in there, I'm doing great."  He looked at the lady on his arm, and she nodded.  "Joe, this is Martha.  Martha, this is Joseph."

"Good to meet you, Joseph."

"And it's a pleasure to meet you, Martha."

We shook hands, and hers was all business.  Calm, dry, and just the right amount of friendly.  Nothing like the "ladies" at the hotel.  Thank god.  A reflection of sunlight lit her up from behind for just a moment, looking like a halo; I blinked, and it was gone.

> "Yeah, Joe.  She *is* an angel."  Well, that's a good thing, isn't it?  "Lucifer was an angel too." Oh.

I want to think that little side discussion slipped past her, but I don't think it did.  Her eyes tightened for just a moment.

"I've heard good things about you, Joseph."

I didn't have a good reply to that, so I nodded and said nothing.  Mr. Wilson chimed in.  "I'm glad you two are hitting it off so well."   I looked at him, but he was looking at her.  It startled her that he would say that so dryly and not to me.

I opened my mouth, and he held up one finger to me.  Okay, something weird is going on here.

> "You got no idea, Kid."

This time, they *both* had their eyes tighten.  I reached out and pushed Mr. Wilson's hand down.

"Okay, as the man said, there's some next-level stuff going down here.  I've got things to tell both of you, and this is not the place."

I looked at both of them.

> "Stick to your guns, Kid.  You ain't done anything wrong, and they need to *confess*."

I do believe HAL hit a nerve with that comment.  Martha looked chagrined.  Mr. Wilson looked at the carrying case, nodded, and headed for St. Michaels.  Not the main door, but a side door, for which he had a key.  Color me surprised.  He'd never said anything about religion, but neither did I.  Inside, it was... old.  It felt old like it had been there for thousands of years.  It also felt rock steady and had that comfortable, lived-in feeling that I got at a few of my friend's houses.  That was before they ran into my parents.  Either they changed, or they left.  I learned not to talk with my parents about my friends.  That only bought time.  I stopped making new friends.  That's what I hated most about them.  I could see the bright flame of life around us, but I could not join in.  I had learned that they would stomp it out or chase it away.

At one time, I thought they might be devils.  Now?  I don't know.  I'd heard enough tales of bad parents in bull sessions at the hotel to know that bad parents were both more common than you might think and a more common excuse than I had considered people would fall for.

Don't tell me that you didn't know it was wrong; you did and did it anyway.  You can't blame that on your parents.  It was your choice.  Did I say that to their face?  No.  They already knew it.

Anyway, here I am in a church that *feels* like the home of someone who cares.

> "It cares more than anyone knows, and because of that, it cannot interfere."

I look at Martha, who has an odd expression on her face.  She sees me looking and nods.  "HAL is right.  He does care and can do nothing to help *because* he cares."

I have to think about that one.  If he cares so much but cannot... Oh.  "Freedom of Choice."

Mr. Wilson looks at me, "Well reasoned, Joseph.  Can you fill in the rest of the story?"

"You are both angels, but I don't think you're on the same side."

Martha looks at me, then glances at HAL and back at me.  "HAL gave you the first part, but how do you figure the second part?"

"Honestly?  You two don't *fit* together.  Mr. Wilson is as straight as they come.  You have more curves than he does."  She glances down at her body.  "Yeah, those too, but you never take the direct approach.  Not unless you're going for the kill."

"How do you figure that?"

"Because it was Mr. Wilson who has this place, not you.  This place is all about direct action.  Taking support, defense, and attack right to the front line and putting it there for everyone.  You work from the side, approaching those who won't be pivotal but will affect those who are.  If you had your druthers, you would never have contacted me.  HAL's existence changed that, and you don't like it."

"Don't like the fact, or don't like HAL?"

I smile faintly, "Both."  She laughed, and Mr. Wilson smiled.
