>By the way, I was not aware that the term "Mary Sue" had an alternative definition, so you have taught me something.

The origin of Mary Sue is known to me.

It came from Star Trek fan fiction and was a self-insert, wish-fulfillment act on the part of the author, who was unduly enamored of Captain Kirk.

That is the definition that first comes to my mind.

In reading the other definition, I can see why they overloaded it to include hyper-competent characters without flaws, as that was what the author wrote to justify drawing Kirk's attention.

Unfortunately, to me that second definition is not a good definition of the term Mary Sue.  It is a secondary effect of the primary definition.

By rights, it should be a separate term, since a wish-fulfilling self-insert can have many different reasons and even include characters who are anything but hyper-competent; and a hyper-competent character need not be a wish-fulfilling self-insert.

Unfortunately, it is what it is.
