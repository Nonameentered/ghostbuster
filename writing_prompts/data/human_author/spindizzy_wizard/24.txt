### New Beginning 

Jones, aka The Tallahassee Strangler, is in his cell, under suicide watch, when the Superintendent comes to see him.

"Jones."

"Superintendent."

"Care to hear the plan?"

"No."

"Too bad.  First, and what I think will interest you the most, the old NASCAR rules, including sportsmanship and clean racing, are coming back."

Jones looks up.

"Are you interested now?"

"Maybe."

"You will be teaching the new drivers.  The cars will be standard, according to your specs, as limited by NASCAR rules.  This is a test for the drivers.  When they pass according to you, they graduate to custom cars and corporate sponsors.  The ideal driver is not a homicidal maniac, which *you* are not."

"I was convicted, and sentenced to death."

"You didn't do it.  The Aryan Brotherhood framed you good.  That information popped loose when their bunks got raided after most of them died.  It's working its way through the courts now.  I had my suspicions, when you first joined.  You were too perfect the mass murderer."

"And yet, you kept me on.  On this death ride.  Why?"

"First, I had no choice.  The Senators were in control.  Second, you were and still are a damned fine driver.  You also weren't afraid to buck me when you were certain you were right.  The others looked up to you.  Not in fear, but in hopes you would drop some driving wisdom on them, and you did.  Quietly, which only made them listen harder."

"And spent the last decade killing them one by one."

"I could say it was the name of the game.  I could say they fucked up.  I could say you had your favorites, and the sick bastards noticed it.  I could say you dealt with the sick bastards, which pissed off some folks to no end.  And all of it would be both true and false.

"The truth is, you are a survivor.  It's what you have done throughout your life.  Against all the odds, all the power plays, all the hidden bastards that wanted your hide for being a better person than they, you survived.

"That's what I want you to teach.  How to survive without turning into the monster.  And I heard it from the one man who should know."

"My son."

"Yes.  Your son.  The Assassin.  Hired by a powerful bastard with deep pockets specifically to eliminate you from the races.  Only he studied everyone in the races and their histories in detail.  You did not fit the mold.  You did not deserve to die.  When he went to his usual clients, and asked if they would like to see any of the prison drivers die.  All of them were adamant that you should live."

"I wish I'd died and he lived."

"I know, but you two fought an honorable race, and brought back sportsmanship to racing.  Something that people wanted, but didn't know they wanted until you showed them.

"Jones, I need you.  I need your knowledge.  Your reputation.  Your mystique.  Help me bring back racing the way it should be."

Jones takes long hours to decide, but finally says "Yes."
