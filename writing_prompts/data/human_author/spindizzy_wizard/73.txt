My father was a very good man.  How he came into possession of the doll is something I may never learn.

"Daddy!  Daddy!  There's a monster at my window!"

"A monster, you say?  Let's go look."

Taking my hand, we went back to my room.  This was a new house, and my room was bare.  We hadn't had time to unpack everything.  The curtains were rudimentary and just for privacy.  Still, it was a much bigger room than I had before, and I know Mother and Father were pleased to have moved here.  I?  I wasn't so sure.  A new school.  All my old friends were left behind.  An unsettling time for any child.

I didn't realize it at the time, but my father took the monster at the window far more seriously than I thought.  The way he stared into the darkness outside the house.  Shifting from side to side in my dark room, looking out the window in all directions.  He nodded to himself and said, "Go wait with your mother.  I have to get something from the boxes we had the movers put straight into the attic."

I ran straight to my mother and told her what my father said.  She hugged me close and kept me on her lap while father was busy bumping around in the attic; we could hear him.  I heard a bad word and clapped my hand over my mouth.  Daddy must have hurt himself, so I said, "ouch."  Mother nodded and hugged me closer.

Daddy came down from the attic a few minutes later.  He had a very old doll with him.  A strange-looking doll.  The mouth was too large, the eyes too small, the ears far too big, and the clothes were painted on.  The fingers on the hands were pointed, not rounded, and there were no shoes.  The feet were twice as long as they should have been, and the toes were claws.

I was fascinated and repulsed.

"Baby, the only way to deal with monsters at the window is to frighten them away with an even worse monster.  This monster has been in our family for many years and has never failed to chase away the monsters at the window.  It was my monster for many years; it's your monster now.  You take good care of it and make sure that it's in your window every night, looking outward.  It will guard you against the monsters in the window."

I saw the sharp teeth in the monster's mouth, and one of them was red.  Shiny red.  "Daddy's ouch?" I said, pointing to the tooth.

"Yes, Baby.  Daddy's ouch.  Daddy had to feed the monster just a little bit so that it would protect you; you don't have to feed it.  Daddy already did."

My parents went with me back to my room and watched as I carefully put the monster in the window.  The feet seemed perfectly shaped to hold onto the windowsill.  That made me happy, it would stay in place, and I wouldn't have to worry.  I climbed back into bed, and Mommy and Daddy tucked me in.  I said goodnight to them again.  As they were closing the door, I said, "Good night, Monster.  I'm glad you're here."  They paused for a moment, then I could see Daddy smile in the light from the hallway, and he closed the door.

I went straight to sleep.

My father had floodlights installed all around the house, with particular attention to ensuring that there was no dark area anywhere near the house.  No shadows, no areas under trees where the lights could not reach.  He even rebuilt the front and back porches, so there was no dark space under them where someone or something could hide.  At the time, I didn't really think about it.  I had my monster, and my monster would protect me.  In later years, I did wonder what my father was worried about, that he spent so much money making sure there was no way to sneak up on the house in the darkness.

"Hello, Baby!"

"Dad!  I'm sixteen!"

"Ah, but you'll always be my baby girl."

It was the day after my sixteenth birthday.  We had a wonderful party, and several of my friends stayed over.  Since it fell on a Friday, we had the whole weekend together.

"Becky asked about Monster.  Why I kept him in my window.  She thought it was a cool idea but wondered why I still kept him there.  We got to talking, and it turns out her little brother has a problem with a window monster too.  Could I give Monster to her for her little brother?"

My father's face went flat.  Almost frightening.  "No, Andrea, you may not give Monster away to anyone but another family member.  Understand, when I fed Monster to give him to you, he would only take the position because you were my daughter.  Bone of my bone; blood of my blood; and he *agreed* that you were in danger."

Mother stepped in at that moment and looked at me.  I looked back at her, and she shook her head no.  "I'll tell Becky that Monster is a family heirloom and that I can only give it to another family member.  I'm sorry, Mom.  Dad.  I didn't know."

Father's face went back to his normal cheerful self.  "Good!  Now give us a hug, and get back to your friends."  We had a group hug, and I went back up to my friends.  Becky was sad that she couldn't have Monster to give to her little brother, but I came up with an idea.  "Why don't we *make* a Monster for your brother?"  How mother happened to be in range to hear that, I do not know, but she came in silently and motioned us to follow her.  We went into her crafting room, where she makes some of the finest clothes and other things that you could ever hope to find.  There, she came out with clay, some small bones, teeth, and claws too!

"We will make a Monster for your brother, Rebecca, but you must tell him that it is *his* Monster, and he cannot give it away for any reason other than to a family member who is in danger."  Rebecca's eyes grew large.  "Is this witchcraft?"

My mother laughed gaily, "No, this is far older than mere witchcraft.  This is as old as the mountains and as deep as the oceans.  This is *psychology*!"  And we all laughed with her.

The crafting was normal enough, except that the small bones had to be assembled into a skeleton that would balance neatly on a windowsill and have plenty of teeth and claws, and the clay was laid on like muscles and tendons.  It took most of the weekend, and we all helped.  We even donated a single drop of blood to the clay "To seal the friendship forever.  You are sisters now."

In the end, the doll was fired in my mother's kiln, glazed in bright colors, with a frightening face painted on, and fired again to make the glaze fuse to the clay.  In the end, Rebecca had a small but dangerous-looking Monster for her brother, which made her happy.  And we were all happy to help Rebecca and her brother.

"Mrs. Featherstone!  Wherever did you get that wonderful idea for the window guarding monster?"

"From my great great grandmother, who had it from hers, and even further back than that if the family lore is true.  A practical bit of psychology that works well with young children."

"Did you actually mix blood in the clay from your daughter's friends?"

"Yes, but there's no danger.  The kiln firing turns it all into carbon."

"Why do it, though?"

"Because Rebecca will believe in it more herself, and that will help her convince Michael.  She can tell him that she and all her friends made it together, just to protect him.  He can pass it to his children or any blood relative's children to protect them when the time comes."

"So it's all psychology?"

"I'm afraid so.  No magic here, just wisdom from the mountains that runs as deep as the oceans."

"What a wonderful idea!"
