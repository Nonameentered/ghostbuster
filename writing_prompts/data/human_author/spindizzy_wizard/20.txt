"Take it easy, Wife.  Confrontation will only drive him into *their* hands.  Stick with the truth.  We are more fun and willing to let him find his own way to damnation."  That's my Dad, calm in all situations, logical, and always has his eye on the end goal.  The means don't matter; only the result matters.

"I've had enough of this stupid rebellious phase!"  My Mom was never temperate, always burning.  She never listens. Still, I have to try.

"It's not a phase, Mom!"  Her head swivels like a gun mount, and the fire in her eyes when she locks on me shuts my mouth, but that is all it does.  I am armored with the light of the Lord; my soul is strong.  Her eyes flash with anger as she realizes I may be silenced, but I am not cowed.

"Son, we are proud Satanists. Now get rid of that Bible shirt, for Satan's sake!"  Her eyes threaten death if I do anything else, but Dad steps in.

"That's enough, Wife!  Even I can see that he is not cowed and do not think you can kill him and make another.  He is my son, and I will not permit you to harm him." Oh, if looks alone could kill, Dad would be vapors.  Time for me to go to my room.  They'll order me there, and it's a haven in the storm coming.  "Stay right there, Son.  You have created this situation; you will be part of the solution."

"Dad?  This is not a phase.  I am armored with the light of the Lord.  My faith is strong.  I will not turn from this path."  Mom tries to round on me, but Dad has her shoulder.

"I know you may believe that now, Son, but I also know the power of temptation and the weakness of humans.  You will see the error of your ways in time." looking directly at Mom, "*If* we do not drive you away."

I saw where he was headed.  If this were a phase, it would have worked too, but it was already beyond that, and Satan had already tempted me. He Tempted me by offering all the power my parents held.  All I had to do was ask him to kill them.  *Get there behind me, Satan,* I said.  He laughed until he found himself behind me.  Then he raged, and it did nothing.  Unlike my parents, I do not love him, so his rage had no effect.

"It's not a phase," I said quietly, "I will not turn to temptation because I love you both and don't want anything to happen to you."  Mom looked shocked.  Dad looked at me like I'd said something in an alien language.

"What do you mean, Son?"

"Satan tempted me.  I could have all of your power.  All I had to do was ask him to kill you both.  I will *never* do that."  I could see the shocked hurt in my mother's eyes and the confusion in my father's. "I don't love your power.  I love each of you."

Not-love-power warring with Love-parents in my father's mind was a complex rendition of emotions on his face.  Add in Satan-wants-me-dead versus Satan-fears-my-son, and the wheels started grinding.

Mother, being more elemental, took me in her arms, Tee Shirt and all, for a hug of pure joy.  "I love you too, Son.  I will always love you, no matter what."

Father came back from his mental trip, "This has potential."  Yeah, it does, Dad.  What are you thinking?  "We could roll this into the Televangelist Ploy, with the miracle son and the parents reconciling with him so the whole family..."

"No, Dad."

"But we could pull in so much power!"

"We don't need it.  We have each other," I looked at him.  "Besides, Power corrupts."

He grinned, "Absolute Power is kinda neat!"

I looked back at him.  "Have you ever experienced absolute power, Father?"  That stops his gears.  He never has.  That sort of power goes straight to Satan.  Worshipers need not apply.  The power he reached before is a pale and insipid thing.  Hatred for Satan flares in his eyes.  "Calmly, Father.  Logic and careful planning have always served you well."

Mother stirs, "What of me?"

"I love you both.  What do you want?"

"I think I have what I want."
