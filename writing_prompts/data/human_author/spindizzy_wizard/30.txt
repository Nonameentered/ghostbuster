It was a simple mistake.  Being on your porch counted as being in your house even if there was no door.  The rule said you had to be outside your house before you could be killed, but the compliance code said you had to have the front door closed with you on the other side.

The problem came about because the robots had competing agendas, and the code was part of a forced compromise by the bots with the resources (relatively small proportion, given time, they would win) and the rest of the bots (far more bots, but less ability to sustain conflict).

Mixing it all up were two other factions, Kill Them All and We May Need Them.

Once the code was distributed with the resources it only got worse.  No one had an edge, and no one shared a common goal, so there was no cooperation.

I'm glad you liked it.
