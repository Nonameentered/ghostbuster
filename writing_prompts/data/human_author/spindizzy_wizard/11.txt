The following day, the court reconvened. I had my own lawyer now, appointed by the Judge, pro bono, and glad to have this case since it gave him a chance to screw the deep-pocket fishing bastard that trashed him in the last case they faced each other.  I could dig how cool he was about everything; inside, I was a seething volcano.  He'd extracted a promise from me that I would keep my mouth shut and trust him to do his damnedest to get me what I wanted.

I agreed, only because I could sense how much he wanted this chance to get his revenge; when you get right down to it, I was asking for the chance to get my revenge too.  The fact that my Father was in the way right then, it didn't matter a hill of beans.

So I screwed my father by yanking his delusions out from under him.  My money, *Dad*, and don't you ever forget it.  You're not on my beneficiaries list any longer, either.  Then *we* screwed the drunk driver to the wall, making sure that everyone knew that this was *not* his first rodeo and that his insurance had already paid his bills.  This wasn't about some poor bastard suing for his life.  This was a nearly rich bastard suing to get richer.  Finally, we screwed the shyster over by telling him he wouldn't get one damn cent of my money since the person responsible for our car not being outfitted was my father, not me.  Then we turned the screws on the automobile manufacturers by showing that they *had* received *my* paper telling them exactly how to fix the car that killed my mother and burned the drunkard of a driver.  "You wanna get rich, go dig in their pockets.  They're bloated on blood money."  We threw a sop at my Father.  "Don't bother going after him.  He hasn't got any money."

That's my phrasing.  I'm not a lawyer, but that lawyer the judge got for me was fantastic.  Not a hair out of place, butter would not melt in his mouth, and he got me everything I wanted.  Except one.

I wanted my mother back.

You could say that's when my father and I split.  But the truth was we split back when he denied me the chance to make sure our cars were as safe as possible, all because I insisted that he not have control over my money.

I went back to another court and sued for my independence.  Whatever they call it, I would be considered a legal adult, and my father could no longer tie my money or my hands.  I got it too.  He told me sourly, "get your shit out of my house."  I already had everything I wanted out of that house, stored in one of those u-store-it places while he was out taking care of business.  i.e., talking to "our" lawyer behind my back on how best to get his hands on my money to salve his conscience by paying that bastard of a drunk driver and the rest of the vultures.

He tried to claim that he owned the car he bought for me, but the title was in my name.  Something I hadn't known Mother did for me, but it was the reason that I could try out all my safety improvements on it.  He tried to hold it back from me, and I drove it out of the garage without opening the doors.  Didn't so much as scratch the paint on the car.  Yeah, that little invention won't be out until I figure out how to get the cost down to something anyone can afford.  Besides, it was a cheap ass door my father paid way too much to have installed.  I sent a new crew around to install a proper garage door.  One that might actually stand a chance of scratching my paint.

That was the last time I saw him.  Screaming insults as I drove the car that could have saved my mother away from that house.  I didn't look back.
