The sign says "Unusual Book Store," I am far enough down on my luck to try anything.

*tingle ringle ting!* 

Woah.  The contents fit the description!    The shelves must go up thirty feet or more, there are those ladders that run on brass railings to reach the highest shelves, but you'd better bring a lamp.

"Good day, Sir.  How may the Unusual Book Store assist you?"

"A verified copy of the Necronomicon?"

"Alas, the last copy sold not but an hour ago."

"Any known accurate demon summoning guides?"

"Also sold to the same buyer."

"A grimoire?"

"Alas, no."

"August Derleth?"

"My good Sir!  We do have standards!"

"I suppose that Madam Blavatsky falls in the same category?"

*sniff* 

"Maybe I'm being too specific.  Anything of an eldritch nature?"

"Sold along with everything else."

"Well!  What would you have for a man down on his luck willing to try anything?"

"I could *give* you one of these bibles?"

    Bible 
    Roman Catholic Press 
    1923
    (Latin)

"I'll take it."

"Thank you, Sir.  The last customer left an entire crate of these, in addition to the cost of all our most unusual books.  I have no idea how I will get rid of them."

Okay, I learned Latin in college.  Why?  The prof was a looker, and the class was small enough we met at her place more often than not.

One of the more unusual things I learned was that parts of the Bible appeared to be made up of several versions of a story woven together.

At this point, I was desperate enough to give a shot at parsing out more esoteric information.  After all, I *did* obtain it from an Unusual Book Store.

Besides, applying my knowledge to twist a BRCL to ends that the Pope would regret sounded like excellent revenge for them buying up all the actual books.

Ring in my second study.  Sir Isaac Newton.  Who did not consider his seminal work, Principia Mathematica, as anything other than an aid to improve his understanding of magic.

*tingle ringle ting!* 

"Hello?"

"I'm dreadfully sorry... Oh!  It's you.  Did the Bible help?"

"I'll buy all that you have left."

"Sir, jests with me.  There are 274 remaining, and I would *give* them to you."

"Nope.  I want to buy them for ten thousand dollars apiece!"

He fainted.  Well, that just made it easier.  I loaded the bibles and rang up the sale on an American Express Agent card.

It turns out that with the right parameters, one of Newton's formulas gives a result that guides you to a story so salacious that the Vatican offered a million dollars apiece for that version of the Bible.

That same formula with slightly different parameters allows you to summon an angel.  Say it in reverse, and one of Lucifer's hardy band will answer.

Was I going to sell them to the Vatican?

Don't be silly!  There are people out there willing to pay a billion dollars for one of these.

"Sir.  A courier delivered this package for you."

"At last!  The Demon Bible!"

*rip tear shred* 

•••

Anyone with that kind of money to burn does not need a Bible that summons angels.  They need a new life.

I make sure they get one.
