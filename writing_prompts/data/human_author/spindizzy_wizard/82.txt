Good story,  I enjoyed reading it.

I have to agree that some aspects were not directly touched on, which could make this a nightmare in the making.  For example, do people still age?  If they don't, what about the people who were already at death's door from age?  Do they regain their quality of life?  Or are they stuck one step from death's door?
