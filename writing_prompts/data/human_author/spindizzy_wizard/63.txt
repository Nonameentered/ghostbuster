"That's odd."

Not exactly what you want to hear from your nurse as they change the bandages on the gut wound you spent hours in surgery getting fixed.

"Nurse?"

You thought your voice was under control, but she looked up at you and smiled that professional smile.  The one that says, no problem!  Nothing to concern you in a wrong way.  Only you aren't buying it.  Her face smoothes out as she relents.

"It's just that you seem to heal remarkably fast."  She tells her assistant to get the surgeon.  "Let's finish cleaning up.  I won't put new bandages on until the doctor can see you."  She hesitates, "Would you like to see it?"

Your curiosity is aroused.  "Yes, please."  She brings over a mirror and holds it so that you can see your abdomen without craning your head or tensing your muscles.  Your stomach looks like Jason and Freddy played tic tac toe multiple times.  "Woah..."  Only you notice what she meant; the wounds and incisions are far more healed than they should be.  "Do you think the doctor will take the stitches out?"

"We will let the doctor decide that."

Moments later, an annoyed doctor bustles into the room, muttering about incompetent nurses, only to stop in mid-mutter and whisper, "what the hell?"  He becomes all professional after that, examining the wounds and exclaiming how remarkable it isâ€”snapping orders at the nurse, who is responding like a robot.  Finally, you have had enough.

"Doctor."  He acts like he didn't hear you.  "Doctor!"  Finally, you reach out and take him by the arm.  He looks at you with a frown.

"Let go."

"Not until you apologize!"  You glance at the nurse, making it clear who deserves the apology.

He seems genuinely puzzled, "What for?"

"Doctor, when you came in here, you insulted her professionally.  You will now apologize for that insult and *mean* it."

"I did no such thing!"

"You came in here muttering about incompetent nurses.  Apologize!"

His face hardens, "you will let me go immediately!"  Your grip tightens.  Your face feels like stone.  "Apologize!"  He struggles; your grip tightens further,  "Let go!"

The nurse steps up to your side, "Please, Mr. Smythe, let him go.  I don't mind.  He's absent-minded about everything except surgery.  He's the best there is."

My grip relaxes, but not enough to let him pull free.  "I saw how you reacted.  I won't tolerate insults, even absent-minded ones.  He can learn to treat everyone with courtesy."  As you speak, you glare at the doctor, waiting for his apology.  Every two seconds, your grip tightens again.  "Can't you, Doctor?"

"Nurse?  I apologize for my intemperate remarks.  I can only say that the initial report was so fantastic that I assumed a mistake was made."

I released him.  "Was that so hard, Doctor?"  The look he shot at me was answered with a dead stare.  He dropped his gaze first.  I let it go.

"So, Doctor.  Can the stitches come out?  I want to take a real shower."

Back on a medical basis, he hemmed and hawed a bit but finally started snapping orders again.  Only this time, the nurse wasn't a robot.

That shower felt fabulous.
