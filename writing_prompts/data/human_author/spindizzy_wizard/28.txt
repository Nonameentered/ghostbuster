The villains had minions.  The minions are dealing with the population as best they can.  In many cases, that's piss poor, but the minions will never admit it, because that leads only to their execution.

A democratic government works best when the populace makes sure their representatives understand their desires.  The largest problem in the US right now is apathy.

The supers did not take control.  They went in, under orders, and destroyed the supers who made it nearly impossible for the average citizen to resist.  What happened after that was the responsibility of the civilian government, assisted where possible by the heroes.

As for forgiveness, the supers obeyed the law.  They cannot do otherwise.  The then govt voted them out.  The League certainly didn't invite them in.  Until a legit civ govt was reformed, the heroes had no right to act.

Regarding trust, the heroes are not the ones who break faith.  The former govt did.  Sure, people are going to be stupid about it.  The heroes are going to ignore the foolish and do the best they can.

Trust will only come from acts.

Much as with one movie scene with Superman, the government did not trust him because they had no way to control him.  He upheld the ideals, not the government.

Yet, if the duly elected govt passed a law that exiled Superman, what could he do about it that would not disregard the very ideals of Truth, Justice, and the American Way?

The only thing he could do would be to use his alter ego to prove that the law was passed illegally.  Perhaps using the Superman identity to deliver the proof.  Until then, any acts he took would be criminal in the eyes of the government.

In this story, it's already set that the heroes accepted the law as legit and obeyed it.

Superman, being sworn to ideals and not law, likely would continue being Superman.  Sooner or later, he will have to deal with civilian enforcement agencies on an adversarial basis.  What does he do then?  It's their job.  They swore an oath.  What do *they* do when their oath pits them against a hero?
