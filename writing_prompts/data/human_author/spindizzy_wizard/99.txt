There you are!  At last!

The Horn of Greed!

By all reports, you spill coins and gems from your wide mouth whenever your owner tips you down.

Well...

Finding you is good enough for me.  Photos, video, 3-D scan, virtual room scan, 0.01-micrometer wire mesh model, with the full 360-encompassing spectrum, so I get all the colors and reflections perfect!

"Jason?  You *actually* found the horn, and all you did was take pictures?"

"Of course!  *I* did not need it!"

"You live in a junkyard: eat one meal a day, if you're lucky, and you say you don't need it.  Jason, you are a moron."

"Perhaps, David, perhaps... but I am a well-adjusted, *happy* moron.  Unlike most people who are filthy rich and never truly happy.  Money can make misery comfortable; it cannot buy happiness."

"Weren't you tempted to tip it over even a little?"

"How would I know when to stop?"

"Fine, fine, fine.  Tell me where it is. You need an independent witness."

"You promise not to touch it?"

"Of course, I promise not to touch it.  Unlike you, I have a decent job.  They've been after me to take some of my accrued leave, and this sounds like a good way to use it.  Some place exotic that takes a lot of travel to see."

"I don't want to lose our friendship. It would not matter to me if you were penniless; I would still count you my friend and consider myself rich."

••• 

What a sweet dunce he is.

•••

I'm going to lose him, aren't I?

••• 

There it is, and even more alluring than his reconstruction.

Gods... How it glitters and gleams!

I promised not to touch it, but does a ten-foot pole count as touching?  I can't just walk away from Easy Street!  Can I?  I understand now.  Why he asked, how would he know when to stop, it wants you to pick it up in your hands and drink deep—not falling for that one, Horn.  I have a cold iron bucket insulated with silk on the outside and a pole of cold iron with long gloves also lined with silk.  You'll not get your hooks into me!  I don't want endless riches; I just want Jason and me to live decently without worrying about where the next meal is coming from or what new insanity my boss wants implemented yesterday that he promised the customer a month ago.

A single bucket of gold and gems is more than enough.

"David?  You look terrible!  Come in!  Come in!  Lie down on the couch; I'll make some tea."  Good lord, what happened?  He touched it; somehow, he touched it.  I hope he learned his lesson! "Here, I added a few bits of this and that to the tea.  You'll start feeling better in an hour or so."

"Bless you, Jason.  I'm a complete and utter fool.  I tried for a bucket full and got it.  I was so proud.  You wouldn't have to worry about your meals, and I would be able to work with you on your VR projects because I could tell my boss to go piss up a rope."

"What happened?"

"What didn't happen!?  One disaster after another!  And always worrying about that bucket.  That gold and gems went through my fingers like water, dealing with one problem after another!  By the time I got to Paris, I had just enough left to buy the ticket home.

"Then things got stupid.  Someone reported I'd found the Horn.  Damned if I know who, but now I had every government of every country I passed through baying for my blood *and* the Horn.  No one would believe that I only took a bucket full.

"It looked bad until another fellow showed up in the provincial capital nearest the Horn, pouring gold and gems all along the road as he passed.  They lost interest in me, and the airline ticket had expired.  I had to make a beastly nuisance of myself at the embassy to get them to acknowledge that *they* were the reason I missed my flight, so *they* could pay for a new ticket.

"You'd think I was asking for their first born!  They finally caved, if for no reason other than to get me out of the embassy quietly."

"You are awfully late getting home."

"Yeah, my boss, the caring asshole he is, fired me in absentia, stole my remaining accrued time off, and hired some new chump just 24 hours after I failed to return.  I know damned well he knew I was coming back, but had hit a diplomatic snag.  Bastard was just waiting for his chance."

"Well, you got your wish.  You can stay here with me, and work on the VR project.  I've got the data to the point it needs a professional touch to make it live."

"What are we going to do for food?"

"I've never worried about that before, and I've never starved, so Im not going to worry about it now.  I have my friend back, that's all that matters."
