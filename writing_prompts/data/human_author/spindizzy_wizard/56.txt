"NO SPAWN OF MINE WILL EVER INDULGE IN SUCH UNNATURAL ACTS!  RETURN TO YOUR CRYPT AND REMAIN THERE UNTIL I SUMMON YOU!"

"No."

"What did you say?"

"I said, "No."  As in, I will not return to my crypt, and I *will* drink maple syrup.  I am tired of standing around all night with my teeth stuck in the bark of a tree, trying to gain enough sustenance to awake on the next sunset!  The human process is faster and more productive and gives humans a profit motive to keep the maple sugar trees healthy.  Something that a certain lord of a certain manor seems to have forgotten can be difficult when a tree has been gnawn in half by a desperate individual!"

Okay, yeah, throwing that incident back in his face wasn't the smartest thing I've ever done, but it did get me one thing.

My freedom.  As the old singer put it, freedom is when you have nothing left to lose.

I had it all.  Guaranteed tree.  Safe quarters during the day.  And if you happened to have any spare time left over from feeding, every creature comfort was available.

It was a gilded cage because attached to all of that was that you had to obey the lord of the manor.

He figured it was a death sentence; only there were a few things he didn't know.

Like,

The fellow who gave me the maple syrup also gave me a cab over camper.  All it needed was some black paint for the windows and some heavy cloth just in case.

Like,

The reason he gave it to me is that I led him straight to a dozen maple sugar trees on his family's property that they had never found.

Like,

He's cool with me being a vampire because that's a whole new market, and he's busy buying up all the surplus he can lay his hands on quietly.

Like,

I disobeyed another of his stupid rules and invested in human endeavors, made a killing, and am richer than he is by an order of magnitude.  Shell corporations and a long view of time can do that.

Like,

I'm about to become the Maple Syrup King by quietly buying up every scrap of land theoretically capable of supporting the Sugar Maple Tree.

Pretty soon, as vampires think of it, Ol'Beaver will suck it from a bottle or starve.

"This is intolerable!  How could we be running out of trees!?"

Not a single peep was heard.  No one wanted to end up like his last spawn, cast into the light to die.  No.  Never that.  But, there was such a thing as survival, and everyone (except Lord Beavier) had bought a supply of concentrated maple syrup.

"We have no choice.  Send scouts to find new land.  Prepare to move from this place.  I will retreat to my crypt.  Assign the remaining trees among you.  Do not open my crypt until you have found new land."

Many thought this was a grand gesture, not knowing that he had kept the small bottle of concentrate taken from his last spawn.

"King?  I've been getting frantic queries about sugar maple land with some serious money behind them.  We could make quite the profit from the weakest of our holdings."

Harry was the good man who introduced me to maple syrup, but he didn't have the long view.  Never, ever, sell the land.

"Who is it from?"

"Beavier Manor.  They sound desperate."

"They are.  The Lord of that manor earned the name Ol'Beaver for how he treated his trees whenever he got desperate.  He considers anything other than sucking the sap straight from the tree a perversion."

"So any land we sold them would end up..."

"...Stripped of every sugar maple tree."

"So what do we do?"

"Sell them syrup at half the going rate, and see if they're willing to go to farming instead of chewing."

••• 

"We have no choice!"

"Beavier is going to go ballistic."

"As much as he is our Lord of the Manor, he is also the reason we are in this state.  I find myself unmoved by anything, or one, who endangers everyone who looks to him for sustenance.  Ask them for an envoy."
