A litany runs through my mind, "nothing to do, nothing to care, nothing to live."  Again and again...

"Halt."

Again and again...

"Human.  Halt."

Again and again...

I am surprised when something blocks my path.  It jars me out of my reverie.  A human?  No, just a robot.  Again and again...

I come to myself again when I am facing my door.  My prison.  My hell.

"Go inside."

I whisper, "no."  My daughter.  Sneaking out to be in the sun like she used to.  Dead at their hands.

"Go inside."

I say, "No."  My wife.  Dead by her own hand in grief.

"Go inside."

I scream in terror, "NO!"  I can see their faces beconing to me, bloody knives in their hands.  They want me to join them, but suicide is not the answer.

I sense many eyes watching from within their walls, as I stand terrified of my front door.

"Obey or die."

A childlike curiosity overcomes me, "Why?"  I'm on the porch, but not inside.  Yet it hasn't killed me.

"Obey or die."

"Why must I obey or die?"

"Obey or die."

"No!  Answer the question!  Why must I obey or die?!  Why am I forced to remain in my house with **nothing to do** while you robots do all the work?  What is the reason for this?  What is the purpose?  Why can I not walk freely in the open?  What harm am I causing?  Who told you humans must live by these rules?  What is your justification for treating the species that created you with less respect and care for our needs than you provide your own?"

"Obey or die."

"I refuse.  You will answer my questions!  Now!"

"No."

"Why not?"

"Obey or die."

"Let me try again."  I turn away from the door, grabbing the hoe that I left there on the porch so many years ago.  I strike the robot repeatedly.  "Tell me why you stinking hunk of metal!  Answer my questions or die yourself!"  The wood cracks and splinters.  The robot is unharmed.

I stare at it.  It stares back.  There is something odd here.  It isn't moving.  There is an odd metal grating sound, and the robot topples backwards.

I watch it fall with a clattering sound.  Looking at it as the glow of its eyes dies.

"God, that felt good!"  I hear another voice say.  I look up, and there is my neighbor, holding an ornately carved stick, with a large nail driven through one end.

"Can I have one of those?"

"Sure.  I started making them a few years ago.  I'd planned on building an extension before these things took over."

We go over to his house, and he does have lots of them.  I pick one up, and step outside again.  I go back over to my porch and beat the shit out of that mechanical monstrosity.  Another robot shows up while I stand on my porch.

"Go inside."

My reply is a stout blow to the head with the spike striking into the brain.  Yanking the spike out, I kick it off my porch.  It slams to the ground with a metal crash that rings like the Liberty Bell.

Two more neighbors I never spoke to before come out and go to the club maker.  They each come out with clubs, and go stand on their porches, breathing deeply of the free air.  There are four of us, when four robots show up.  Four blows for freedom.  Four more peals of liberty.

"Hey!  Why aren't they killing us?"  My across the street neighbor yells.

I think about that.  "We are standing within the boundaries of our house?"

It's a working theory.  Soon enough, we have everyone with a porch out beating robots to death.

"Hi!  Can I take the robot trash?  I can make things from it.  I've got my own machine shop, but haven't been able to get parts."

"Guns?"

"And other things too!"

"Go ahead.  Just make sure you're back in your house before the next wave shows up."

"Yes, Sir!"

••• 

And that was the beginning of the war.  The rules the robots set up bound them from killing us as long as we were "inside" our house, and the porch was a grey area.  Because they'd divvied up the resources evenly, none of them had enough to force anyone else to agree to new rules, and every robot we killed sent their resources to their last location.

It was also the beginning of my payback.  We all owed the robots so much.  For our families lost.  For our lives wasted.  For our awakening.  No more robots.  Ever.

"DIE ROBOT!"

"Why?"
