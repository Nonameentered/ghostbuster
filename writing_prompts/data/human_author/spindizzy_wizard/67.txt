I understand, Lucifer, now.  I could not understand why he rebelled, but now I do.  There comes a time in any being's existence when doing what they honestly believe is the right thing is completely counter to their leadership's guidance.  We are instructed to have faith in our leadership.

I failed my test of faith.

I did what I believed was right.

I paid the price.

And I am still confident that what I did was the right thing.  Not granting aid at that time and place would betray all am.  I was right, too.  Only the leadership *fixed* my *blunder*.

That I could not accept.  I repudiated my leadership, and they cast me out.

So be it.

I will join Lucifer.

"Welcome to Hell, Melchor."

"I am here because I could not agree with my leadership."

"Unfortunate, that.  Well, our duty is to tease out every evil fiber of humanity.  Anyone who shows the slightest taint is slated for our domain.  We are free to use any method we wish, any trick we can devise, any means to cause a human to show their true evil nature.  Feel free to take on any soul you wish."

"Thank you."

It did not take long for me to realize that the vast majority of souls that gave in to temptation were indeed flawed.  Yet that only fueled my passion for doing what I believe is right.  If the creator could make broken souls foredoomed to Hell, then the creator could also make souls that needed only a tiny nudge to move them from one side of the ledger to the other.

I did not want any soul to come to Hell, especially not after experiencing it myself.  But, as I now saw, the best I could do was set up situations that, indirectly, encouraged positive behavior, specifically for those who were on the edge of temptation.

I looked for those souls who were already doomed, albeit slowly, and set situations that *should have* resulted in the acceleration of their downfall.  Only they were surrounded by those on edge, and as they fell, they would rebound between those souls, knocking each of them towards good decisions.

I practiced this technique to perfection.  So subtle were my manipulations that none of the others were aware of my actual effect.

When I came upon the soul that I had tried to save, it was a shock to me.

That soul, which had been nearly pure, and needed only a simple word to solidify its path, was now a cesspit of carnal sins.  I was furious.  This is how the creator treats such a soul?!?  UNACCEPTABLE!

I would save this soul.  Restore it to the glory it once held.  Force Heaven to take in one it tried to expel before gaining entrance.

This time, the ball would rebound to Heaven's side AND take many deserving souls with it!  A complex of souls, each destined for Hell, each able to adjust course to glance against the one I sought to save, who would then reflect against many others, giving them the nudge they needed to reach Heaven.

I suspect that Ego was my downfall, or would that be uprise?  My adjustments were so subtle that many of them fell in the realm of quantum.  When you dance with quantum, you are never in complete control.

I released my adjustments.

At first, everything went smoothly.  It wasn't until things had reached the point of no return that the first reports of a massive upwelling in souls reached us.

The souls I tagged to deflect the primary soul continued deflecting other souls on the way down, eventually running out of energy to lose.  Then Brownian motion knocked them against each other.  Every one of those impacts bounced off the edgy reality of Hell, and the souls shot upwards like rockets.0

I did the only thing I could, stand there and watch in silent amazement, along with every other agency in position.

Lucifer's tirade bored me to tears.

The not-so-quiet laughter from "above" infuriated me.

I left and went to the creator.

My tirade left Lucifer's looking like what it was, a small child's temper tantrum.  When the others remonstrated with me, my list of their failings was comprehensive and offensive.  When the creator attempted to calm me, I gave it a rendition of *its* behavior when it cast me out.  I think that shocked it the most.

My fury spent, I stood there proud and unbowed.  I would not give an inch.  I knew I was right beyond any doubt.

The creator spoke: I HAVE WAITED FOR YOU.  YOU SHALL BE MY SON.

••• 

Of all the indignities I have suffered, being selected as his son is the greatest.  Yet I would not change a thing that I did that brought me here, for the joy that my presence brought my mother and father.  The two souls I saved from the very edge of Hell.

I know what I must do, but the first thing I must do is to honor and cherish my true parents, Mary and Joseph.  They taught me something the creator never did.

Love.
