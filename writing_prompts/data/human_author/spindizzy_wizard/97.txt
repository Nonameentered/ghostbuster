I had no clue what was going on.  Sarge — we call him that because he was one — hands me a shotgun and tells me to stay at this door in this hallway and "Shoot everything that moves."

A zombie apocalypse?  Alien invasion?  Riots?  What is it?  Sarge was already gone with the rest of them.  The other veterans.  Me?  I'm a silly-vilain who can shoot better than any of them, and they know it.  So when it comes to cases, why am I always the one handed a scattergun and told to guard someplace where nothing ever happens?

The complex we live in is deep underground.  I was born here, SuBama34.250.

Subterranean Boston Atlanta Metropolitan Axis, Sector 34, Level 250.  That is, it's kilometer 34 from Boston Terminus and 250 meters below the original surface.  There's a gigatonne of shit on and above the surface level, so we are far more than 250 meters down, but I don't think Sarge knows how far down from the sky we are anymore.

Only the vets seem to have a grip on what's happening. Everyone else closes their eyes and ears and tries to act like nothing is happening.

The air in this corridor is coming from the north. It's a lot colder than I remember too.  I wonder if we have a surface breach.  It is January, so it would be cold out there.

...

It's been hours, and the others still haven't returned.  What's that?  Sounds like running feet.  With the echoes in this area, it's impossible to tell where they're coming from.  But... There's a stink I've never smelled before coming from the north.  It makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up.

"RAAAAGGHHHGGH!"

My careful planning goes right down the trash chute.  It's bipedal, and I might have called it human, but two eyes, ears, two arms, and two legs do not make a human.  Not with those eyes bloodshot and focused on my few remaining seconds of life... I unfreeze and trigger the shotgun.  He must have been frenzied. It takes two close-range rounds to put him down.

The tango is a mystery of contradictions.  Pieces of modern battle armor mixed with crudely forged plate armor.  A machete in hand with an M16E23 with AntiLazarus Treyfoil rounds.  Any of those would kill any of us with a simple near miss!  Yet the preferred weapon is the Machete.  I take the weapons and add them to my harness.  The M16E23 needs servicing; it is unsafe to fire as it is.  The ammo is all recent manufacture.  The barb's kit did not include servicing tools.  A good cleaning and the onboard AI reports ready.  I'll hold it in reserve.

Uh, Oh.  That stench is back.  This time it's three, but I get headshots because they tried to crowd in on me. Messy.  Bleah.

Looking at them, none of them were using their modern weapons.  For heaven's sake!  One of the bastards has an M60E90 tied to his back to hold up the guidon for his unit!  A Canadian unit.  This begins to make sense.

The ice age is coming.  Everyone left the Great White North, but these holdouts.  Now it's bad enough that they're coming out of the woods looking for shelter.  I wonder why we don't take them in.

That's when I noticed the fourth one's necklace.  Those are not bear claws.

They're young children's fingers.

No way are we letting these animals inside our perimeter.

There is no further action at my point until Sarge comes back.  There are bandages, but everyone is moving like they're mostly okay.

I come to attention.

"Report!" barks Sarge.  I give a report in the same terms the other veterans use.

Sarge looks at me.

"Well done... Veteran."

My face remains serious, but my heart swells with pride.

I am a Veteran now.
