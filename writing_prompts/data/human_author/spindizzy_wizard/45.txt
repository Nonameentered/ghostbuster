*I... you can... minds.  If you... turn right now.* 

I turned right.  Ahead of me was an old house.  More correctly, a gothic mansion in.  Contrary to popular belief, it was gaudily painted, yet the colors worked well together.  The effect was of an aged crone wearing heavy +q
*I'm in a brightly painted building.*

Of course, where else would you be?

*If you would be so kind, come to the front door and ring.  Ask to see Samantha.  Tell them you are my Uncle George.*

Now how did she know I was named George?  I don't have any siblings, so I cannot be an Uncle.

*... adopted... twin... Georgette...* 

Now that was flatly impossible and something I could check on.  Dialing my parent's home, my father answered.

"No time, Dad.  One critical question, yes, no, am I adopted?"

"Sigh.  Yes."

"Thank you, later!"

So, it's true.

Knocking on the door, I read the small plaque, "Daisy Rae McFae Asylum."  I didn't think anyone used that word anymore unless it was a political asylum.  Obviously, that was not the case here.

The door opened without a sound.  Impressive in a house this old.  "Hello, How may I help you?"

"I'm George Mankowitz, and I'm here to see my niece, Samantha."

"I'm sorry, but the people cared for here have no other family.  You must be mistaken."  He goes to close the door; I edge a toe in to stop the door.

"I'm sorry, but I believe that you are misinformed.  Samantha is the daughter of Georgette, whom I just discovered is my twin sister.  I am adopted, you see, and I'm trying to connect with my biological family."

"Ah?"  He peers at me closely, "You could be related, at that.  You may enter and wait in the parlor.  I will summon the Supervisor."

It's a well-appointed parlor.  The color scheme is still cheerful, and here nothing is lying in wait under the paint.

*Watch out!  She hates us!* 

And as quickly as I hear Samantha, she's gone.  I try hard to read Samantha, but what I get isn't entirely human.  *[Hate them... Danger... Kill... Hate them... How did he find them?  Kill!  Kill!  KILL!... Study...]* 

A mighty woman with red hair strides into the parlor, demanding, "How did you find Samantha!"

"That is privileged information.  Are you the Supervisor of this facility?"

"Don't give me that nonsense.  You tell me how you found them and you do it now, boy!"

Something splashes on the outside of my mind.  It would burn, but I'm back in my shell.  For once, I am glad I cannot read minds all the time.

"No.  Are you the supervisor?"

More vitriol splashes; this time, some gets through.  Enough to understand what I face.  One of the Fae, and a nasty one.  A flash of information from a different mind, common defenses against the Fae.  My shell closes just in time.  The iron poker from the fireplace set should do the trick.

"Get back!  Get back or eat cold iron, McFae.  I will see my niece and sister, **NOW**!"

She is screaming in some language I don't understand.  Behind her, the man who answered the door is holding something low and closed.  With a look of concentration on his face, I feint at the Fae to keep her attention; she stumbles back and right into the iron spike the man was carrying just as he thrust it forward with all he had in him.

It explodes out the front of her body, above where the heart would be.  The entry point is so low that it must have passed almost through the vertical center of her body.  Almost immediately, a flaring glow emanates.

"Lad, we've little time.  This way, if you would save your kin."  I stare at the man, who now appears with pointed ears.  "Move!" he commands, and I start into action.

I have no idea where this adventure is going, but I'm down for it.
