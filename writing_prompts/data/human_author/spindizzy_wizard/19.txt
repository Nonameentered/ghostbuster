### Every night for five years 

Silently, "Lord, thank you for all you have given me.  For the sake of my friends, many who do not believe in you, I ask for a sign that they will accept that you exist. Amen."

### Sunday Morning Day 1,827 

Who would be hammering on my door at this hour? "I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!  OPEN UP!" Rude too!

"Patience!  I'm coming!"  Good Heavens!  Still pounding!  My friends prefer to sleep in.  If he keeps this up, they're going to be upset!

"Stop knocking!  I want to open the door!"  For a wonder, he does stop, I get the door to open a crack, and *wham* it slams open, and a body lands on me!  "Augh! Help! Help!"

My friends are there, and they yank the body off of me.  I finally see my assailant, and... He's a priest?  My friends shoved him?  "Stop!  Cease!  Desist!  He's a man of the cloth!"

Bill, the most vocal of my friends, replies.  "He's a damned nuisance, hammering and yelling like that!"

"William?  Did you ask why?"  The mulish look was answer enough.  "You know better!  Father?  Why were you so rude?"

"Rude!?!  You have made the same prayer for five years!  It has woken me up at 4 AM every day for five years!  I've finally had enough of it and want you to stop!"

Had my prayers been answered?  Hope soared, tempered by the number of practical jokes I have experienced over the years.

"Father?  Would you please come in?  Go on into the living room and sit wherever.  I will be with you shortly."

"Thank you, and my apologies for losing my temper."  He enters, and my friends are about to leave.

"Please wait.  He is right about one thing.  I have made the same prayer for the last five years at bedtime."  They all nod.  "Silently.  I've never told anyone what that prayer is."  That got their interest.  "I know you would prefer to go back to bed, but if the three of you humored me, I would appreciate your presence while I speak with this priest."

Bill, rough around the edges, and I would not change that, "You think it's a trick?"

"It could be, and your skepticism is needed.  All three of you."  My hope must have shown.  They all agree.  "Peaceably, he could be the answer to my prayer."  Bill nods, but I can tell he's irritated.  "Come in."

They enter, and I shut the door.  When I reach the living room, the priest apologizes for waking them up but says it is necessary.  They all look doubtful, "Would anyone like a cup of coffee or tea?"  All four accept coffee; it's easy enough to fill since I drink a lot of coffee.  I have an office-sized coffee pot—five cups with all the trimmings on a tray kept ready.  Bill jumps up to help, glaring at the priest, who tries to get up to help.  The priest smiled and sat back down.  Bill nodded and took the tray to the coffee table.  We sat and went through the ritual of coffee.  All three understand the necessity of good manners, even if they implement them differently.

Perhaps I should introduce my friends.  Bill — William — is, for this discussion, Ethos.  De — Deforest — is Pathos.  And Len — Leonard — is Logos.

Bill tends to speak from his knowledge. He is gaining authority because of his expertise.  De is emotional, talking about how things feel and generating feelings.  Len is logical, always building his arguments with precision and care.  The three together are a powerful team.

"Father?  Be known to my three stoutest friends, Bill, De, and Len.  I am Sophia.  I ask you to introduce yourself and your reason for being here."

"Thank you, Sophia.  I am Father Patrice DeLevant, of Paris.  I am here because your lady has made the same prayer at 4 AM every day for the last five years.  I'm afraid being awoken so rudely, even for an acceptable prayer, wore on my temper over the years.  I had assumed that the dream that awoke me was something of a test for me.  I did not think it was god trying to convince me to answer, but over the last year, I started having... Dreams? Visions? Of a woman, I had never seen before, with three shadowy figures and hints of a location.  I finally prevailed upon the Archbishop to help me lay this question to rest.  Imagine my surprise to discover that the clues pointed to this floor of the building and that there were four occupants.  Three men and one woman, each living in one of four apartments.  It could not have fit the dream and prayer closer."

Bill asks, "What was the prayer?"

"I would prefer to establish my bona fides first.  Can any of you think of how to verify my claims of being a priest from Paris?"

That instigated some discussion among my friends, from which they decided to call the Catholic Diocese of Washington, D.C.  That being the closest organization that might have the desired information.

A lengthy call and a perusal of Father Patrice's passport established his identity and that he was in some hot water for having left so abruptly.  Through their *good offices* — although I have my doubts — Father Patrice was connected with his archbishop.  The initially calm discussion turned vitriolic and resulted in a torrent of French that left poor De blushing.  Father Patrice slammed the phone down hard.  He stood there, breathing deeply until the phone rang again; his sharp "Oui?" quickly modified to a polite explanation that the call was interrupted by an idiot who would not believe that a miracle had been granted.  He thanked them politely and ended the conversation.  Whereupon he said, "Would it be acceptable to disconnect this abomination for the remainder of my stay?  I'm afraid that if we do not, we will be repeatedly interrupted."

De objected, "You leave that phone with me.  I have a few choice words for whoever was on the other end."

Father Patrice blushes, "forgive my intemperate language.  It was the archbishop."

"If he can provoke such a response, he needs a good dressing down.  I'll be more than happy to field his calls."

Len peered at our guest.  "The guest bedroom is down that hall and on the left.  It has an attached bathroom, take a nap.  We will awaken you in an hour."  Patrice looks at me, stunned.  "We expect the archbishop will be calling, having our discussions interrupted like that will do no good," finishes Len.  I look at Patrice and see what Len saw.  Patrice's eyes are red and watery.  He needs a nap.  I nod, and shoo him down the hall just as the phone rings.  De snatches it up and doesn't even get to say anything as a volley of high-volume French is fired down the line.  De has to hold the phone away from his ear.

I have to escort a shocked Patrice to the bedroom, push him in, and shut the door.
