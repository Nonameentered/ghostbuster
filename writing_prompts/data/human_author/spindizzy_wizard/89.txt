### Human Pack Bonding 403: Parasites 

You will find the notes for this class in the shared class storage.  There is no textbook; you will help me write it.  And, yes, that means you *will* get a share in the royalties based on your contributions.

As such, *before* you begin any research, you will bring your topic to me so we can discuss who else may be working on the same topic.

Oh, And If I Find Any Evidence Of Plagiarism, I Will Flunk The Entire class with prejudice.  Now that I have suitably impressed you with my irritation at your predecessors let us begin.

#### Human/Zerg-Wasp 

"The Zerg Wasp is one of the few outright parasites that have taken on a degree of intelligence.  They may have intended it to kill, transforming the bitten into a potent weapon against the invading species.

However, the original parasite would consume the target, as it uses the target's resources to power combat and does so with utter abandonment, disregarding long-term deleterious effects on itself.

With the advent of intelligence in the parasite, it became possible for the host to... *discusses* the future of the combined organism.

Naturally, after its mission was complete, the Hive Queen mandated the death of the hybrid as an unwarranted risk to the purity of the hive.  This rule was enforced with even greater rigor after the parasite was discovered to have intelligence.

What the Queen consistently failed to understand is that it left the Wasp with no desire to return to the hive, and no basis for loyalty, as the original parasite acted solely on preprogrammed sensory reflexes...

If there is one thing humans understand, it is preprogrammed responses to sensory stimuli.  Reflexes.   They are masters at self-instilling them, refining them, and removing them.

They also have the highest average resistance to external influences, which grows stronger with practice rather than weaker through fatigue, all else being equal.

They are the ideal platform for the Zerg Wasp to meld with.  The Wasp knows to avoid draining the host, and the human can resist the hive-oriented programming easily.  Even more, this combined two of the most lethal predators of the galaxy into a single cooperative organism.

The chaos management skills of the human, combined with the cool logic of the Zerg, created the Zerman Assassin.  The single most feared organism in the galaxy.  Not immortal.  Not unstoppable.  But implacable and lethal to all races save the exotics that are not Carbon/Hydrogen based.
