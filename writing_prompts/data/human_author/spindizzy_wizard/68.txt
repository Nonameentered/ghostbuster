In the end Lord Graymoore ordered one of his sentinels to kill Raymond.  When he refused, Graymoore threatened his family.  The residents of Graymore Manor rebelled against Lord Graymore.  Raymond walked away, knowing that he had killed his next to last blood relative, and left his last blood relative, the servant, to fight it out against Lord Graymoore and any who stood with him.

How cold do you have to be to walk into the manor, knowing that your extended family is going to assault it, die, and walk away from your last blood relative while he fights for his life?

An agent of the IRS, Raymond, knows the answer to that question.
