Dear God... How many have I killed?

I look at my handiwork.  The devastation.  The sheer exuberance of the destruction.  For the first time in my life, I cannot enjoy it.

I look back down at my feet; at a newborn.  It could not be more than three days old, and I have killed its parents.

How many babies have I killed?  None?  One? Ten?  A thousand?  I do not know.  I did not care.

I cannot leave this child here.  If my nemesis has not arrived by now, she will not be here in time to save this child.

I pick up the child and wrap us not up in my cloak.  The trip will be long and cold, but I cannot fly as fast as I might have; the child does not have a super physique.

Home at last.  My nose tells me that this child has performed one of its two essential functions: excrete.  I research the cleansing process.  My mind fills with designs for an automatic device, but I reject it.  It offends my sense of how I was handled as a child.

••• 

Crying?  It was fed before I set it down to sleep.  Research.  Ah.  It needs regular feeding and likely *sniff* excretion cleanup too.

••• 

Three days.  Three days and, I have developed a new respect for the common man and woman who can deal with this voracious appetite.  I have had to resort to nasal filters for the odor, which have become exceedingly unpleasant.

••• 

Five days.  How can anyone deal with this?  Then I look at his eyes, and I feel a surge of something.  Something that motivates me to keep going.  I swear, one look from that child and I would walk stark naked through a howling blizzard to see him safe and sound.

••• 

Seven days.  I don't know how much longer... A knock at my door.  My nemesis.  I stare at her.

"There have been no evil schemes all week, I was worried about you! What happened?"

My charge chooses that moment to wail.  An automaton, I turn to answer the call.

"What in the world?"

Having answered the call, I return to the door with the child in my arms.

"I've been doing your job for you."

I hold out the child, and am amused that I have to show her how to hold a baby.

"You didn't come.  The child was barely three days old, defenseless, and you did not come.  What kind of hero are you?"

I present this would-be hero with a baby bag loaded with everything she is likely to need, and close the door.

The child wails, and so do I.  Yet this is for the best.  She will be able to find him a home.

I wonder... Where do I go from here?
