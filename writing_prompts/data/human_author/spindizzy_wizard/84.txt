He walked in so calmly that I didn't even notice until the first stifled scream.  After that, everyone else decided they could wait.

Six foot six, *drenched* in blood, with what looked like a Kabar buried to the hilt in his chest.  His eyes were glassy, no surprise there, he's probably shocky, but he's still standing steady.

I hit the intercom, "We need an ER room, stat.  Knife wound to chest, knife in place.  Appears in shock.  Security to the ER lobby, immediately."

Now to keep his attention.  I hate this part.  It feels like I'm a judas goat, leading them to their doom.

••• 

Gods... What a fucked up day.  Who knew that bastard would be that strong?  Or have that much blood in him?  I keep replaying the last part of the fight.  He spraying blood from his carotids.  Me seeing that fucking knife of his headed for my chest.  The thump as it went home, the violence of the hit driving me backward to slide through the pool of blood from his men.  I wonder how much of it I swallowed.

"What on Earth happened to you, Sir?"

Where am I?  Oh, yeah, hospital.  I can't pull the knife myself; I'd bleed out internally.

"Sir?  Can you hear me?"

There's a distant voice calling.  No.  Don't stop.  You have to get to a hospital... Why won't my feet move?

"The ER team will be here soon.  Hang in there!  You've made it this far!"

ER?  I made it to the hospital?

"Joe!  Don't be stupid!  Just stand by in case he wakes up."

Guard.  There's a guard.  With a gun.

"SHOW ME YOUR HANDS!"

I have something in my hands?  I look down.  There's that bastard's knife.  Boy, am I soaked with blood.  Oh, yeah, my knife.  He probably wants it.  Tired.  So tired.  I stare at my hand.  Even through the blood, my hand looks bloodless.  I force the fingers to open, and the blade falls into infinity, clattering on the floor so far away.  I raise my head so slowly and look at the guard.  A kid.  He's just a kid.

I have to tell him.  "You're safe now."  My voice sounds like it's coming from a thousand miles away.  "I killed him."  Yes, I did.  Cut his fucking head off, and he still did this to me.  "You don't have to be afraid anymore."  His eyes get big, and he mouths my words just before I say them.

"I killed the boogie man."

••• 

Thank god!  He dropped the knife!  I can't hear what he's saying, but Joe's eyes are getting big.  Something about... The boogie man?  Joe safes his taser and stuffs it back into his holster.  Oh, shit!  The big guy is fainting!  Joe is there, catching him just right to avoid doing any more damage.

The ER team pops out and takes charge.  Was it really that short?  It felt like forever.  Oh, good!  They're taking Joe too.  And here's the shift super from security.  He's got the scene in hand, and the city police are here too.

••• 

"Christ, what a mess."  One of the cops looks at me strangely.  "What?"

"Please, don't say that.  Not that way."

He's a bit older than Joe, but he's shaken.  "What happened?" I ask gently.

"Christ the Redeemer Church, a late night mass, someone slaughtered the congregation, then took the priest's head."

What?  That makes no sense!  "The Redeemer has been vacant for the last twenty-five years.  Ever since the last priest went insane and tried to kill the congregation."  He stares at me.  "He didn't kill anyone. One of the altar boys got him from behind with a big candlestick."

What he says next puts chills down my spine.

"Someone killed a lot of people there.  The blood was an inch deep on the floor.  Bodies piled up to the side of the altar, left to bleed out.  One set of tracks came in at the run, and there was some fight.  The guy in priest's clothes had his head cut off."

Oh my god.  He's going shocky on me.

"You come with me right now."

Besides, if I haven't heard about this, they're trying to keep it quiet, and his mouth is on autopilot.  We don't need more rumors on top of everything else.

I escort him back to an ER store room.  It's out of the way and only used for mass casualty events.

"Here, sit on one of the crates."  He's so stiff.  "And relax.  I'm a retired city police officer too.  I was there 25 years ago, at The Redeemer.  That priest came to still raving about removing an evil influence."

His face is getting more color.  Good.  "I don't know about that.  All I know is about 50 bodies with their throats slit to the bone and left head down to drain the blood onto the floor.  A set of tracks inbound, a fight, a slide mark through the blood, and a set of bloody footprints leading away.  We tracked them to this area but lost him.  I'm pretty sure your patient is the perp."

"Maybe, but the perp of what?  Killing the real perp?"

"I left on the search.  I haven't heard anything since."

"Which is odd.  Mass murder at a closed church?  I'd have thought the news would be all over it."

"No news?"

"None."

I watch as he goes pale, "Hey!  Stay focused!  No fainting!"  He points at the wall; I take a quick look.  It's a calendar.  "What about it?"

Hoarsely, "Is that calendar right?"

I look closer.  "It's a week off.  This room gets checked once a week."

Hoarse and shaking, "What year is this?"

I tell him, and he faints.  "Aw, shit."  I hit the call button.

"Who's in there?"

"Security Supervisor David Franks.  I have a police officer here who's fainted.  Can I get some help?"

••• 

They are surprised I'm still awake.  No one has touched the knife; they're getting an x-ray machine in—small thing.  Weird film plate; looks too slim.

"I killed him."

They don't seem to pay any attention.

"The boogie man.  I killed him.  You are safe now."

A young nurse twitches and looks me in the eye.  I nod.  She squeaks and darts out of the room.  That draws irritated notice, and a replacement is called.  The young one comes back in, dragging an older woman.

"JUST LOOK AT HIM!"

The matron looks at me in exasperation and does a double take.

"Smitty?"  She asks incredulously.

I nod.

She goes pale, and the young one quickly escorts her out of the room.  I play it back and forth in my mind.  So slow.  "Mom?" I whisper.  Ha.  They are paying attention.  They glance at each other briefly; then the doctor breaks the spell.  "Move!"

They intubate me, hang more IV, and I'm gone.  The darkness claims me.

••• 

I'm standing outside the young officer's room while they work on him.  The ER charge nurse is quizzing me.

"What happened?"

"He looked a bit green and was babbling about mass murder.  I figured he needed some time out in private to get settled again.  Been there myself, so I have a clue.  We were talking about Christ the Redeemer twenty-five years ago; I responded to a call.  The priest had gone nuts.  A choirboy clocked him from behind with one of those heavy candlesticks.  He was still raving when he came to."

"And then?"

"He looked around the room and saw a calendar.  Went paler than before, I asked what's wrong.  He asked what year it was.  I told him.  He passed out."
