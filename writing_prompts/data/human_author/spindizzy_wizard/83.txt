"He came from Redeemer with a story of mass murder and fainted when you told him what year it was."  Like she's trying to fit it into a puzzle.

"What have you got?"

"One of our new nurses thought she recognized him.  She dragged Wilhelmina in and insisted she looks at him.  She says he's Smitty, her boyfriend from 25 years ago.  They were going to get married at Redeemer, but he disappeared that night.  He was never found."  She pauses, "David?  What was the name of the choirboy?"

I think someone just hit me in the back of the head with a brick.  "Joseph Genadi.  Same as my newest team member."  I'm whispering as I say it.

••• 

"Hey, Mina?  What's going on back there?  I've got two sets of city cops out here fighting over jurisdiction and demanding entry?"

I wait.  Wilhelmina is pretty good about getting back to me.  Only the voice that answers is breathless and young.  "She's not well—bad emotional shock.  I've got her sitting down.  Can you pull up the staff psych and have him come down?  There's some weird shit going down.  Get the ER coordinator too.  We need at least three bodies to handle the people down due to circumstances. Get the priest down here too.  There's one guy who may need confession and last rites."

"What do I do about the cops?"

"I dunno.  I'll ask the security chief."

"Thanks!"

••• 

"Sir?  There's cops out in the waiting area, fighting over jurisdiction?  They all want in, right now."

"*christ*  I'll be right there."

"Betty?  Don't let those cops back here.  They're not going to understand.  I'm not sure I do, but I think I've got it better than them.  I'll try to calm them down."

Betty nods, and leaves that to me.  As I'm walking out, I hear her tell that young lady "good job," and handing her some more tasks.  They would have been done by Mina, but she's in the staff lounge shaking over a cup of coffee.  I'd stop, but those cops are the bigger problem right now.

Damn.  She's hurting.

Duty sucks.

I step through the door to the waiting room and I'm immediately jumped by two groups.  Not happening boys.

"***ATEN'SUN!***"

Still got that voice.  Once the door closes behind me, I start quietly.

"Y'all are a *disgrace*.  This is a hospital.  You are scaring the people who come here for help.  You will *ALL* come with me.  *NOW.*"

I don't even wait for them.  I head off to my office.  I don't look back; there is no question in my mind that they will follow.  They do.

It's a bit of a squeeze.  "Fit anywhere you can.  I'm going to tell you what I have now.  For those of you who don't know me, ten years ago I was Sergeant David Franks.  I was a first responder to Redeemer twenty-five years ago, when the priest went nuts and got clobbered by a choirboy.  I can see half of you looking at me like I'm nuts.  How many of you remember that event."  They divy up like I think. "You have just confirmed one point that is going to choke all of you.  Let's drive it home.  Write down what year you think it is and drop the paper in my hat.  Use one of my notepads."

They're puzzled, but curious too.  They do it, though.  I gather them carefully, so they can see I'm not pulling a fast one.  I lay them out in two columns.  There's eight of them and two groups of four.  One set is twenty-five years in the past.  The other is my year.

"There, gentlemen is the crux of the problem."

They look at the numbers, look at each other, then look across the room at the other set.

"That's right, boys.  You are both duly sworn-in officers of the city police.  Now I'd appreciate it if you acted like it."

A bit hangdog from the seniors.  One junior asks, almost plaintively, "you expect us to believe that we've got a time rip?"

"You have a name for it.  You all remember 25 years ago differently.  You all confirmed the year.  And I've got a junior security man on my team, who has the same name as the choirboy, who may have recognized the man whom you may be looking for.  I also have a matron who identified the original patient as her fiancee from 25 years ago, who disappeared that night.  A young man, who came in here on his own two feet, soaked in blood, with a Kabar rammed into his chest to the hilt.  When asked to, he dropped the knife he was holding like he'd forgotten it was there.  He said something to my junior, which I haven't got the story on yet.  My junior is being treated for shock.  So is an officer from *your* side of time." Gesturing at the down-timers.  "Which is where I got the time clue from.  We've got that matron, who *should* be treated for shock, but we are already short-handed.  I don't need head-butting.  I do need people who can work together to solve this.  Can we cooperate?  Police work hasn't changed much, but I'd like to pair one uptime with one downtime.  Social issues and how we handle them have changed a lot.  Can we work together?"

I get nods from all around.  Not this time.  "I need a verbal acknowledgement from each of you."

One by one, I point to each of them, juniors to seniors.  I get a clear yes from each.

"Good.  Pick out your match from the other team.  Like rank with like.  Now, put your heads together and share every scrap of information you have.  I'll keep an eye on the ER.  Come to me when you've agreed on a plan of action."

Good officers.  They dig in while I go find out what the rest of the world knows.

Whatever is going on, it's going to get worse before it gets better, and my hospital is in the middle of it.
