"I've come for you, Jötunn."

That was my introduction to Thor.  "God" of Thunder.  Witless fool if you ask my friends and me.

"Who?"

"Do not think to deceive me, Jötunn, as you have these humans.   I know your kind all too well."

Okay, look, that's prejudice right there.  Bigotry.  Being down on someone for what they are.  *I* didn't know I was any different other than being taller than anyone else.  I had thoughts of going into Pro-Basketball, not ending up in a feud with an Asgardian.  Honestly, at the time, I had no effing clue who this lunatic with the hammer was.

"My name is David Franks.  I am not this Jötunn person you're looking for!  I go to school here!"

"Enough lies!"

It was then one of my many friends stepped up. She was blocking his attack with her body.

"Stop it!"  Of all my friends, she was the shortest.  Of all my friends, she was the fiercest.  It may be cliched, but she lived up (down?) to that brilliant red hair of hers.  "David is my friend.  You have no right to hurt him; he has not hurt anyone.  *Unlike your brother, Loki!*"

That brought Thor up short, with a thunderous face, "Do not meddle in things you do not understand.  Loki is Asgardian!"

"Loki is at least half Jötunn, has caused havoc wherever he goes, and is not trusted by anyone.  David was born here, has grown up here, has never caused trouble, and does not deserve your wrath!"

I finally got my voice back.  Having an angry, insane muscular man come at you with a hammer like Thor's is unnerving.  "Honest!  I don't understand!  I haven't hurt anyone; why are you after me?"

"Because you don't belong here.  Because, sooner or later, you will respond to your Jötunn nature and cause such havoc that the humans will have to put you down."

"You cannot know that will happen."

"It has happened everywhere a Jötunn has grown."

That's when Mary O'Connor spoke up again.  "And did they face unthinking bigotry before they did anything wrong?  Ha!  You never thought of that!  Did you?!  You never once looked into the mirror and asked yourself if *you* were responsible, did you!?"

"I told you not to interfere, girl!"

That's when he got stupid and swung that hammer of his at Mary.  So sure, I stepped in the way and caught the hammer before he connected with her.  You can imagine my surprise when it hit like a feather and he could not move it from my grip.  I took it away from him.  A dangerous thing like that in the hands of a hot head?  Especially when he just tried to murder one of my friends?  I don't care what he claims, that hammer would have hurt Mary, breaking her arm at the least if it didn't kill her outright.  When his companions showed up, they asked politely if I would return it.  I set it on the ground.

"If the hammer wants to go back to him, he can take it.  Otherwise, I'll keep it safe until he can pick it up again."

You see, Mary had explained part of the lore of the hammer.  The only way I could have taken it from Thor is if he wasn't worthy.  I had it, and it showed no desire to return to him.

That's how a Jötunn, which I might be by birth but not by upbringing, got his hands on Thor's hammer.

Time for Thor to learn another lesson that he should have learned long ago.

Nature versus Nurture is not an either/or question.  It is a spectrum with a bell-curve distribution.  Loki did not have to be the villain and it was not his nature alone that made him one.  The Asgardians raised him in the royal family, of course he was raised to expect some degree of authority, but sibling rivalry with an obliviot for a brother drove him to seek more power.

In the end, you could say that Thor is as much at fault for Loki's behavior as his being Jötunn.  As much as Thor may care for Loki, he did a damned poor job of considering Loki's point of view.

Anyway, I have the hammer now.  And Thor can have it back when he grows up.  I've got a feeling it may be a while this time.  Especially since my biological parents are pushing on me to give it to them.

Sheesh.

It doesn't work that way, and you might be my biological parents, but you sure as Niflheim are not my Mother and Father.  Now go home, before I get all unreasonable and pick that hammer up!

***Shhhiiiwwang!*** 

Shit.  I gotta stop catastrophizing; the hammer is a bit too literal-minded.  Be back in a bit.
