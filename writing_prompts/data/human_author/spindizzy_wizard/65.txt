I could not believe my ears.

“Help, I’m King Arthur, and I’m lost! Can you help me find Camelot?”

I looked at this raggedy man, who still managed to look regal.  "King Arthur?"

He looks at his clothes, "Despite appearances, I am King Arthur.  Can you help me?"

I'm an old man myself.  Were it not for good planning; I might be in this gentleman's shoes.  "I'll do what I can.  Can you tell me what year it is?"

I can see he is puzzled by this question but answers it nonetheless.  "It is the year of our lord 513.  May I ask how this helps?"

My face must have shown something because his face fell before I spoke.  "In my time, this is Anno Domini 2022.  I do not know if I can help you, but neither will I abandon you to the elements.  Please, come home with me while we consider what may be done."  His face struggles with a smile.

"I would not be a bother."

"Nonsense, the bother would be if I left you to your fate.  It does not bear thinking on.  Please, it will light my evening to have conversation again."

He hesitates, but a fat raindrop on the nose convinces him. "I accept your generous offer."

We walk swiftly across the greensward, coming to my cottage before the storm truly breaks.  Standing inside, he looks out the window as if expecting someone or something.  "Were you traveling with another?"  I ask.

"No, no, It's just that I've grown accustomed to signs during weather like this."  Seeing my questioning face, he continues, "Like lightning."

In the instant, a brilliant flash of light followed immediately by a thunderous boom.  We both jumped and laughed.  Somehow, the lightning put him at ease; he spoke more freely, as if to an old friend.

I questioned him about his last memories; they were of receiving word that Mordred had landed an army on the near shore and that his army must march to meet them.  I'm afraid the various authors all got it wrong.  Mordred, for all of his origin, was a trusted general bringing reinforcement against the Saxons.

When I expressed some surprise over this, Arthur spoke freely of all the good works Mordred did in King Arthur's service.  Unbeknownst to my guest, I set a device recording his voice as he spoke.  We took breaks for cleaning up and dinner and relaxed before the fire while the storm raged.  Arthur spoke of many things, but not one word of a knight named Lancelot or a woman named Guinevere.  I now doubt that they ever existed.

In time, he ran out of things to say and asked after my life.  I hesitated but spoke before he could withdraw his question.

"I am a scholar.  I study literature of the period you come from.  In particular, I study all accounts of your life that I happen across."

As I feared, this enflamed his curiosity.  Nothing would do but for him to see these writings.  If he were a deranged man of this time, what harm in letting him see?  But I had been seized with the thought that he *could* be Arthur.  In that case, letting him read to his heart's content would bring nothing but heartache.

"I beg of you, Arthur, do not poison your mind with the thrice told tales of five hundred or more years after your time!  These writers are unknown to us but for writing of you!  We do not know if they had ulterior motives to write these stories, some of which are naught but betrayal and lust dressed up in fine language."

I believed that I had convinced him.  We went to bed and awoke to a hammering at my door.  When we answered, a man in a cloak with an oaken staff stood at the door.

"Merlin!  I had thought that this time I had gone too far."

Merlin glowered at him.  "You nearly did.  Come!  We must be on our way!"

Arthur ran to his room to gather his things while I spoke with this man.  Or rather, I pried while he bit off words like a miser.

"Is he really...?"  "Yes."

"And there is no Lancelot?"  "Yes."

"I begged him not to read any of my books."

That drew a long look.  "Did he?"

"No."  For that, I believed, was the truth.

Merlin seemed satisfied, until Arthur came down the stairs.  In his hands was the one book I would have preferred he never read.  "La Morte de Artur."

Merlin shook his head, "You tried.  But sooner or later, he was going to find someone.  It's just bad luck it was you."

I look at that book with dismay.  "Have I altered the past?"

"No, it doesn't work like that.  The past he comes from will fade into myth and legend.  What you know of that period will remain valid."

"I'm sorry.  What he told me was far more desirable than the end of that tale."

That perked Merlin up.  "You have the true tale as Arthur told it?  Write it!  Publish it as widely as you can!  We may yet save the memory of Camelot from the mire and mud!"

So I did.  A faithful rendition dressed up only for language.  I published it.  It failed miserably.  I put it up on every literary site I could.  It was hunted down and destroyed by fans who could not accept such a story.  "Where is Lancelot?!  Where is Guinevere?!  This is boring!"

In time, I lived down the book.  Satisfying myself with debunking elements of other stories by bringing in what I learned from Arthur and using that to find the corroborating facts known to the archeological societies.  I planted the seeds of destruction.

I left all my resources to my grand-nephew, who bore my name and a similar interest in literature.
