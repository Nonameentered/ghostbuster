Not long after, we saw 'window guards' for sale in toy stores.  They were ugly and made of plastic, with nothing of the natural world around them.  The teeth were rubber and the claws foam.  Nothing about them spoke of a child's security and safety, only of making money from a fad.

Rebecca's mother tried to replace Michael's hand-made window Monster with one of the cheap plastic things.  Michael's nightmares returned immediately, and Rebecca and her mother got into a terrible fight.  Rebecca and Michael came to our house late one day, begging to stay there awhile.  Michael was in a terrible state, with dark circles under his eyes, and Rebecca wasn't much better.

Mother took one look and said, "Yes."  She got us all settled in my room, with Michael, who was still young, sleeping between us in my bed.  Rebecca said it was the first decent sleep he'd had in a week.  Mother was in her crafting room, on the phone with Rebecca's mother.  I walked past at one point, just to see how she was doing, and Mother had the phone at arm's length while the most awful language came from it.  She shooed me off.  Later that day, a woman in what looked like a uniform came by to see Rebecca and Michael.  Rebecca talked with her but wouldn't let her wake Michael.  She finally agreed that the woman could look in on him.  The dark circles under his eyes were still visible, but his face was relaxed and peaceful.  Her face went soft, but then her lips pursed.  I thought I heard a small bad word from her, but I was never sure.  She returned to my mother's crafting room, and they spent several hours there talking.  When the official lady came out, she looked dead set on getting her way, but my mother was smiling.  I guess she was going to talk with Rebecca's mother.

We stayed home from school the next day so Michael wouldn't be left alone.  My mother and father were both there too.  When Mr. and Mrs. Stein came to pick up Rebecca and Michael, Mr. Stein had Michael's window Monster with him.  He went to one knee and told Michael that this was *his* window Monster and that no one would ever take his Monster away from him again.  Michael looked at his mother, who broke down in tears and held her arms open for a hug.  Michael hugged them both, but only after making sure he had his Monster in his hands.

Michael never had another nightmare.

I was about to turn eighteen, but so was Rebecca, so we decided to combine our birthdays and have one party on *her* birthday.  After all, her birthday fell on a Friday that year; mine was three days later.  We'd get to have another all weekend long party.  It was such fun the last time, and we were all still close friends.  Since her parents were having house guests over, it just made sense to have it at our house.  We had more room outside, and we wouldn't be underfoot.  Besides, Rebecca said my parents were way cooler about things than hers were.  Not that they didn't love them just as much, but that they were a bit more strict than mine.

Everything went great on Friday and Saturday.  Saturday night, things changed.

The wind had been picking up all day, and the forecast was for severe thunderstorms.  Mom and Dad laid out candles, and I could tell they were a bit worried.  I didn't understand why.  We'd had severe thunderstorms before, but Dad got out these heavy storm shutters and put them up over all the windows.

"Don't worry," Rebecca said, "Your father's just being careful since we are all here.  He doesn't want anything to happen to us."  If it had been just my father, I might have believed her.  But mother was acting a bit odd too.  She was in her crafting room most of the day, and some of the smells that came out of there weren't very nice.  Only when mother came out she had gifts for each of us.  Charm bracelets where each charm was one of us.  "You've been good friends with each other over these last two years.  These bracelets will remind you of each other in the years to come, and you will always know how to find each other."

We were thinking, "woah, magic!" but Mother showed us how each charm had a secret place where you could tuck a small piece of paper with a phone and address written on it.  When she left us to fill out our little slips of paper, it was quiet little Marcia who suggested we should include a lock of hair in each of the charms as well as our number and address.  We looked at each other with conspiratorial smiles and went about subverting my mother's mundane bracelets, turning them into magic talismans that would keep us together forever.

In later years, I realized that my Mother was a wise and devious woman.  She *expected* us to do that.

The storm peaked just two hours after midnight, the wind was howling, and we were snuggled up together on my bed.  Yes, it was crowded, but no one wanted to be too far away from anyone else.  A tremendous CRASH as a tree fell on the house, crushing the hallway between my parent's bedroom and mine.  We were trapped there, but shouting through the door, we reassured my parents that we were okay and still sheltered from the storm.  The power had gone out simultaneously, so I lit one of the candles and put it in the water cup we used to ensure that the candles didn't turn into worse hazards.

Half a candle later, there was another awful groaning sound, almost a growl, and something smashed against the shutters!  Again and again!  An awful howl in the night and the sounds of a terrible fight followed.  We were hiding under the covers, with another mattress over us, wondering if the house would cave in.

As soon as the storm passed, my father got word out to the fire department, and they came to cut us out of the house so we could go to a shelter.  By the time they managed to get us cut free, it was light enough to see around the house.  Yes, trees were down all around us, and one of them had smashed the center of the house.  But the one that really frightened us was the one that tried to jab its branches through my bedroom window.  If my father hadn't put up those shutters, it would have gotten through, and we would have been hurt.

I overheard one of the firemen commenting, "That's the weirdest marks I've ever seen.  Almost like claws trying to get through the shutters."  The other remarked back, "You think that's weird?  The tree trunk looked like something *bit* through it!"  That's when the old Captain came up, "I don't know what the hell he used to brace those storm shutters from the inside, but it almost looks like claws were holding them in place."

I got out Monster and looked at his claws.  Sure enough, the glaze was worn off, and there were what looked like bruises on his arms and feet.  The red tooth wasn't red anymore, so I pressed my thumb against it, and I swear it bit down, just hard enough to push that tooth through the skin.  I made good and certain that the tooth was well covered and told Monster, "Thank you."  I can't swear to this, but I think he *winked* at me.  By that time, I didn't care.  Monster was my protector, even if I was eighteen, and there was no way I would let anyone take him away from my family and me.

Instead of going to a shelter, Rebecca's family agreed to take us in for at least a night or even a week.  Michael had come running into his parent's bedroom, saying that his Monster had told him to go hide with his parents.  Not long after that, there was a crash, and a branch had fallen through his bedroom window.  When they went looking, Monster could not be found.  Michael insisted that Monster had gone to protect Rebecca.

Later that morning, after we had all gotten a bit more sleep, we found Michael's Monster outside the house, a good twenty feet from the window.  I could see his father's brain ticking over.  *Twenty feet away from the window, when the branch had fallen* inward *driving everything in the room further into the room?*  He glanced at me, I looked at him, he shrugged and gave Monster back to Michael, who promptly stuck one finger on a tooth.  He didn't say a word or even twitch.

Michael's father asked my dad about where he got the heavy storm shutters he put up.  "Funny thing you should ask that.  I got them from my great grandfather, who made them from a big tree that landed on his house.  There are two trees down, and I only need one replacement shutter, so I can make you a set for your house.  One thing, though, you got to help make them."
