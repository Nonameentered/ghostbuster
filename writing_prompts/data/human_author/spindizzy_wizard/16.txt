Ook didn't know as much as the high heads.

Ook wasn't as strong as the long arms.

Ook wasn't as fast as the long legs.

Ook wasn't as creative as the fair ones.

In fact, Ook, and his tribe, were equally bad in every category the five tribes measured themselves by, except the one that truly mattered.

Adaptability.

If survival said you had to be a thief, then a thief you were.  Everyone else had advantages that they held pure and most important.  To a thief, all skills and abilities are essential.

Intelligence is helpful, but wisdom is better.  Intelligence tells you if you can do something.  Wisdom tells you if you should.

Ook's tribe did not pit their intelligence against the high heads. Instead, they looked at what the high head elders told their young.  "Apply yourself to your studies, and stay away from all others, *especially* Ooks!"  Ook's tribe was wise. They understood that youngsters are drawn to the forbidden, so they trolled their young within the view of the high head young.  Soon enough, unauthorized unions took place.

Pregnant high head women were ostracized and left for the Ooks, where they were treated well.  "We understand these little things, share your knowledge with us, and we will teach you what we know."  Taught that knowledge was power, they stayed and learned wisdom. "Survival is important.  Survivors are adaptable.  Survivors will use whatever comes to hand to survive.  Becoming whatever they must to survive."

Thus it went with the long arms and the long legs.  The Ooks grew strong, fast, and intelligent until only the fair ones remained.

When the Ooks came to the fair ones, they were welcomed.  Their diversity accepted and appreciated.

The fair ones looked at their creativity and found it lacking.  They openly chose mates among the Ooks, forsaking the purity that the others, now too few to survive, held tightly in their grasp.

The fair ones, and their Ook offspring, engaged in breeding the Ook and themselves, sought a single ideal that would survive no matter what.  The Ooks pointed out that "we cannot know the future, so we cannot know what ideal will survive."

The fair ones pondered this and decided, "creativity is important; without it, both wisdom and intelligence will fail.  Yet there is truth in your saying that a single type may find itself trapped in a dead end.  We propose that we mix with you and the Ooks split into separate tribes, each seeking out a far land and making it their own.  From those centers, we will grow in isolation, eventually remixing when we meet again."

The Ooks looked at this and saw their wisdom reflected through creativity.  "We agree," and the first Diaspora was on.

"Chief?  Where are the species we planted here?"

"I... I don't know!  Send sampling teams."

The teams came openly.  Many tribes welcomed them.  Few rejected them.  Fewer still rejected them with violence.  One tribe evaded the newcomers with such skill that they avoided notice altogether.

"This is terrible!  Our entire experiment is contaminated!  How can we know which species is best if they have mixed themselves?  We must wipe out these mongrels and start again."

The tribe that evaded notice learned of this because they were the greatest thieves of all the tribes.  They stole the knowledge and shared it with the other tribes.  They stole much else as well.  Things that they did not understand; save that they were necessary.

"These beings are not gods.  They intend our destruction for a failure that was theirs to begin with.  We were never separate species, because separate species cannot successfully interbreed.  Let us drive them off our land, and live our lives the way we wish."

There was much discussion.

Some reached the ears of the newcomers, who became alarmed and left, posting notices of a deadly species "spontaneously arising" on this small planet of this distinguished star in this gap of the galactic arm.  "There is nothing on this planet or in the gap it exists in that any of our societies needs.  Avoid at all costs."

Young being young, they snuck in and played with the "dangerous" new species.  Until a terrible accident, involving a weather balloon caused a crash that killed several children.  The humans tried to save them, although their motives are in doubt, a living alien is worth ever so much more than a dead one.

The scientists played on the "barbaric" medical treatments as nothing more than vivisection, demanding the destruction of this danger.  Their fervor was their undoing.  The truth came out, as it often does, and that race of scientists was ostracized.

The new species, as deadly and uncontrolled as they were, were posted "Danger: Human" and left strictly alone.

Except for the scientists, who came and experimented on us, seeking some shred of evidence for which species was ascendant.

They're still looking, and we steal their secrets every time we get the chance.

Sooner or later, we will go to the stars.  For we are the most diverse species in the galaxy.  We may not be the best at any one thing, but our ability to adapt and overcome adversity is second to none.

Yes, "Danger: Human" suits us well.
