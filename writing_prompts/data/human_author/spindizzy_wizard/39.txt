The battle raged for days.  Heroes versus Heroes is the most terrible kind of war there is.  If it were not for the city defenses built in when the Heroes Hall and Plaza were constructed, the city would be a smoking ruin.

The battle ended when Sampson walked out onto the plaza and stood in plain sight of all the heroes and cameras.

"I am Sampson!  My power is to cause the death of any biological.  I have used that power on rodents purely as a test.  I tell you now that my greatest wish is to be a force for good.  If you are too frightened of my power to allow me the chance to save lives by destroying disease, then kill me now.  I stand here, in the center of the Plaza Of Heroes, to prove my words and will to do good.  I swear that no matter what happens, I will not turn my power to evil.  I will never use it to take a human life."

The assembled heroes listen to this speech.  They can see that he is not invulnerable.  There are wounds.  They bleed like any other.  There is pain, yet he stands tall.  There is fear, but he will not retreat.  There is hope, and it burns brightly indeed.

"NO!  HE IS A DANGER TO ALL!  HE MUST BE DESTROYED!"

Sampson stands resolute.  "If you believe that, Doctor Brain, show yourself.  Prove that you are not a lying coward who broke so many laws that APEX was freed from your control to preserve his primary function.  Impartial legal rulings and evidence security."

"LIES!"

"APEX!  PRESENT THE EVIDENCE AND MAKE YOUR RULING!"

APEX begins his customary dry recitation of rulings, violations, and evidence, replaying any relevant recordings in holographic format—increasing volume to override Brain's hysterical denials.

At the end of the presentation, Sampson, still standing calmly, continues.  "All I wanted when I first came here was to serve however I could at the most extraordinary job anyone could have.

"All I wanted when Williams and I returned was to go to the moon to complete my training so that I could eradicate disease without endangering anyone.  You see, I recognize the potential danger, just as each of you realizes your potential to cause great harm.  I wanted a safe place to train, and if I could not learn to handle this power carefully, I would remain—a permanent self-exile rather than risk killing even by accident.

"What I found was a pattern of deceit, lies, treachery, and slavery.  The author of all that pain was none other than Doctor Bra..."

A beam of intense light strikes Sampson in the head.  The results are gruesomely catastrophic.

"I NOW DECLARE DOCTOR NED OSCAR BRAIN A FAILED HERO AND NOW A MURDEROUS VILLAIN.  HE IS STRUCK FROM THE ROLL OF HEROES, NEEDING A 70% CONFIRMING VOTE OF ALL OTHER REGISTERED HEROES.  YOU HAVE TEN MINUTES TO REGISTER YOUR VOTE."

Williams steps out of the Heroes Hall and strides to the center of the Plaza of Heroes.  Kneeling by the mortal remains of his trainee.

"*FEAR CAUSED THIS DEATH.  BUT ONE MAN PULLED THE TRIGGER.  THAT WEAPON IS DOCTOR BRAIN'S INVENTION.  ONE HE NEVER SHARED WITH ANY OTHER PERSON.  NOT EVEN APEX.  I CAST MY VOTE, YEA.  BRAIN IS A CRIMINAL MULTIPLE TIMES OVER. NOW HE IS A MUR..."

The same weapon shoots Williams, but his TK power brings random debris up to block each shot. 

"...DERER!  YOU KNOW MY POWER.  I AM NO THREAT TO THE WORLD!  WHY DO YOU TOLERATE BRAIN'S ACTIONS?  VOTE!  VOTE FOR YOUR OWN LIVES FREE FROM FEAR!"

In the end, the vote did go against Brain, but only because the heroes who followed Brain landed in the plaza and protected Williams.

Not that it mattered.  The building Brain was in collapsed.  Too many shots in too short a time.  His body was recovered and positively identified.  Not that it means much when you've got a hyper mind on your hands.

The rule that excluded Sampson was forced by Brain.  On the basis of three test cases, none of which resulted in human casualties because their sponsors were able to contain the damage.

A simple mathematical error, of the sort anyone might make, turned that rule into a disaster as the offsetting value of the other qualities was halved.  Sampson could have been accepted the first time he applied, but the program returned erroneous results.

APEX's constant attempts to have it fixed drove Brain to distraction.  Brain was so certain of his infallibility that he rejected APEX's statements and ordered APEX to cease reporting such incidents. 

As the number of rejected applicants soared, Brain defended it, saying, "APEX does not make mistakes."  In three years, there was a hero shortage and a surfeit of villains and vigilantes.  The latter, Brain took as proof he was right.

All the death and destruction due to one man's ego and a missing decimal point.
