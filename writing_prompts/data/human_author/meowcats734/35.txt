Bold of you to assume that I do avoid writer's block, ehehe. But the main method I use to keep writing is hopping between projects; writer's block for me is usually something that ramps up the more I try to force it, but the corollary to that is that I can work for a small amount of time on an arbitrary project before the pressure to stop gets too high, and for some reason, it resets between different projects most of the time. So I've been hopping back and forth between working on a webserial, editing a friend's novel, writing short stories for litmags, and finishing the final draft of a novel I've been chipping away at for two years.
