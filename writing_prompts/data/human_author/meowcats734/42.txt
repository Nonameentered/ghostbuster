"Wasn't done. The two arms, they've gotta be all ursine."

"Ursine as in, uh, bears?"

"You're the all-knowing, all-powerful entity here. Yes, as in bears."

"I have wisdom beyond humanity's comprehension, and yet I still have absolutely no idea why you would ever want that."

"No, no, it's not about me, you see. It's about my freedoms."

"Your freedoms?"

"Yeah. Spelled out right in the Constertution. Everyone has a right to bear arms."

"That... that's not what that—"

"Hey! Are you giving the orders, or am I?"

"...yes, master. Your wish will be granted. Hey, don't you think it's a little hypocritical to use an enslaved genie to protect your freedoms?"

"Huh? Tell me where the Founding Fathers said 'thou shalt not use an enslaved genie to give everyone bear arms.'"

"...Never mind."
