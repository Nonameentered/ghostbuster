# Soulmage

**"Do you have any idea how** ***exhausting*** **heroing is?"** I asked. "I mean, saving people and fighting evil is cool and all, but we've been eating off scavenged supplies for the past three months, and I can't remember the last time we slept in an actual bed."

"Two months back, in the middle of that warzone," Meloai helpfully supplied. "Plus, a simple sociopolitical anylsis analysis shows that there's... really no need for heroes here. We came from a battlefield with a clear enemy that needed to be slain; but the problems that plague the Crystal Coast are things like homelessness, criminal activity, and poverty."

"None of which would be helped by our traditional methods of killing things with energy blasts," I finished. "Besides, our last battle left us, er, somewhat injured, and you have the best healers in the region. So... yeah. In short, we're looking for a job."

Queen Szilth gave the five of us curious looks. "I... see. I must admit, when I heard a band of five grizzled war veterans was requesting an audience with me... I expected more of an 'off with her head' approach from your band of heroes."

"We... we just got here," I said. "We're not the kind of people to try and murder people we've just met, and we're still recovering from the *last* warzone we were stuck in."

"Where we were killing the kind of person who *would* murder people he'd just met," Lucet quietly added from my side. I squeezed her hand reassuringly. 

"Mm. Well, I suppose I can see why you didn't go down to the docks like a typical laborer would. What a list of credentials you have... a shapeshifter, an ice witch, an oracle, an enchanter, and a... soulmage?" Queen Szilth counted each of our party, finally landing on me with a quizzical stare. "I must profess, I've never heard of your ilk before."

I shrugged. "Jack of all trades. Any field of magic you can name, I can cast at least a basic spell in it, with enough preparation."

"Ah. A fascinating claim. I can't say there are *standard* positions for those of your talents, but... let's see. The police lack a good sketch artist, and the recent increased criminal activity would make a shapeshifter's aid invaluable in getting images of criminals from eyewitnesses. We're currently in a bit of a drought, and my harbormaster told me that we can free the salt from the ocean by freezing and thawing it; if you're up to the challenge, we could certainly use an ice witch's help. Much of the income flowing into the criminal underbelly in the Crystal Coast comes through technically-legal casinos; if you're willing to assist with bankrupting them, I can point your oracle in their direction. There is no end of infrastructure that an enchanter with strengthening spells could aid, and..." Queen Szilth finished running down the list of my companions, reaching me. "The jack of all trades. He who claims to be able to cast a spell from any school of magic in the world."

I nodded. "You're speaking to him."

"Mm. Then I have a simple task for you. I want you to teach my mages *how*." I raised an eyebrow at her, but she was already moving on. "I'm no stranger to integrating refugees of war, and although you lot are one of the more, ah, exceptional bunches... we do *have* resources available. Thought healers, to talk over any traumas you may have experienced. If you ever have trouble adapting to civilian life... do let me know."

I met Szilth's eyes, then nodded. To my left, I felt Lucet sag a little, a tension in her shoulders fading. "Understood," I said.

Szilth handed us a sheaf of papers. "Then welcome to the Crystal Coast, citizens. I do hope you enjoy your stay."
