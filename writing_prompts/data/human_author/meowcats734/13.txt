# Soulmage

**Distance was strange on this side of the mortal veil.** The space an object took up was determined not by its physical volume, but by how much it had impacted the living souls of the world. And so in my ethereal form, I passed by mountains the size of sand grains and hearthplaces that loomed like towers.

But all that was dwarfed by the planetoid of memory and emotion that I had come all this way to infiltrate. The wide complex was practically a miniature town, and its legend had been contributed by hundreds of thousands of souls. Even as nothing but a memory, it would be difficult to sneak inside.

I was up to the task, however. I was nothing more than a figment of imagination; what use would the weapons of the soldiers within be against me? So after analyzing the whirling planetoid of hopes and emotions, I pulled on the fabric of soulspace around me, *remembering*  a moment of my life. Soulspace responded, forming a dragon of willpower and memory, and I clambered on, willing it to fly through the void.

Landing on the surface of the chaotic mass that represented the fortress-complex, I pressed my ear to the ground, sifting through all the memories this building held. If the secrets I was searching for were anywhere, they'd be in the building's soul. Dismissing the dragon—keeping it manifested was too much of a strain on my mind—I looked into the soul of the fortress...

...and the soul of the fortress looked *back* at me.

I screamed and stumbled back as the ground *blinked*, one face, two faces, three, surging out from the ground.

"Foolish ghost," the uniformed specter whispered. "Did you think we had no dead of our own? *Even in death, we still serve.*"

The soldier lifted their weapon, and the last thing I heard before falling unconscious was the ringing of a distant alarm.
