Thanks for the critique! The language around Tento is contextualized in the rest of the serial; ditto for the true purpose of the Truthtellers. Balancing how much context is needed from the rest of the serial to understand the core components of a standalone story is one of the harder things I've found in my adventures writing serials, so I appreciate the feedback.
