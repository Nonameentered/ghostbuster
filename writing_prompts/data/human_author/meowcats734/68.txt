**The elf's skin bubbled and snapped as he rose from his crouched position.** As one, the four of us took a step backâ€”we all knew Iola could kill us with a snap of his fingers, if he so desired.

"Well." Iola turned towards us, grinning a smile that drooped and melted. I had no idea what his eldritch flesh was made of, but its eternally-regenerating nature meant that Iola was nearly impossible to kill. "Fancy meeting you four all the way out here. How can a war hero like me help some fine citizens of the Silent Peaks such as you?"

"We're not citizens of the Silent Peaks," Meloai pointed out from my left. "We left the Silent Peaks because of *your* actions."

I winced. Meloai meant well, but... that was the wrong thing to say. Iola's grin stretched wider and wider, squelching wetly as it distended his head. "Why, whatever actions could you mean? I was simply trying to reclaim what was mine. After all..."

Iola's soul shifted, space *melted*, and in a heartbeat he stood behind the four of us, one arm around Lucet's throat. Lucet herself stood stock-still, eyes wide with numb disbelief as Iola whispered, "The hero gets the girl."

And then Lucet spoke.

"No," she whispered.

Iola tilted his head. "What did you just say to me?"

"I said, *no!*" Lucet spun around, drawing power from her soul, and hurled a frost spell that rent the air with a shriek of ice and froze Iola's lower half solid. Iola staggered back as Lucet balled her fists, readying another frostbolt.

But the unkillable elf got to his feet, laughing, a manic, inhuman light in his eyes.

"That," Iola whispered, his voice slimy and rough, "was the last mistake of your life."

And the four of us closed ranks as Iola surged towards us, arms outstretched as the war hero prepared to tear us apart.
