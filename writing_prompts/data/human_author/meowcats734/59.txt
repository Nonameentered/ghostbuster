**"I'm very sorry,"** the Demon of Empathy mused, "but that's not the bargaining chip you think it is. Aim higher."

I blinked. "Selling you my *soul* isn't enough of a bargaining chip?"

The Demon of Empathy tilted their head. "Your soul will fall into my domain eventually. Hastening that eventuality by a scant few decades is... not nothing, but certainly not worth the price that you ask."

A chill ran down my spine. "What... what do you mean, my soul will fall into your domain?"

The Demon of Empathy gave me a kindly, sorrowful, empathetic smile. "You've lived much of your life—especially certain key moments—experiencing too much empathy for others. Not all of your soul will fall into the Plane of Empathy upon your death, but enough will. Enough that... I'm afraid that salvation for the one you ask is not a fair trade."

I scowled. "Since when do you care about fairness?"

"Since humanity did," the Demon of Empathy simply said. They folded their thick, muscular arms across their chest. The soulspace surrounding us was featureless and empty, so the Demon of Empathy manifested a chair to sit on. "I know that you want to save your uncle. Believe me, I feel your soul as if it were my own."

"Gee, thanks. That's an *awfully* reassuring thing to hear from a fucking demon," I muttered.

"Would you like me to reassure you?" The Demon of Empathy leaned in. "I am very reassuring, when I want to be."

"No," I snapped. "Get to the part where you name my price. Do you want the secrets of attunment? Is that what you—"

"Unfortunately, I already hold that knowledge as well," the Demon of Empathy calmly replied. I flinched. "If I were not otherwise engaged, I would gladly assist you here and now with slaying the monster that holds your uncle hostage—but I have my own goals as well, and I cannot save everyone. Were I to expend the resources necessary to save your uncle, it would shatter countless more souls who depend on me for their survival."

I closed my eyes, clenching my fists. "...Please. Jiaola... my uncle... he was there for me, when I needed him. When I hated myself so much that my soul was overgrown with thorns. If you really are a Demon of Empathy... *help me.*"

"I cannot," the Demon of Empathy murmured, and rifts help me, but they sounded genuinely regretful.

I fell silent.

Then I whispered, "Help me, or I will consign my soul to oblivion."

By the stunned silence that followed, even the Demon of Empathy didn't expect that. "Excuse me?"

My eyes shot open, and I glared at the Demon of Empathy. "You think you've won because my soul will fall into your domain upon death? Well, *fuck you*. If Jiaola dies here, I'm finding the nastiest soul-eating monster on the continent and jumping straight into its maw. And you don't get anything. No soul fragments, no memories, *nothing*. Only an eternity knowing that you could have saved an innocent man from a horrible fate and *refused*."

"You wouldn't dare destroy your—" The Demon of Empathy grimaced. Because yes, the Demon of Empathy understood me. Yes, the Demon of Empathy had a read on my very soul.

And because of that, they knew all too well that I was more than willing to carry out my threat.

"You throw a tantrum and flip the board because you are losing," the Demon of Empathy finally said. "This helps nobody."

"This helps him," I shot back. "Give me *something*. Anything."

The Demon of Empathy took in a deep, frustrated breath.

Then, incongruously, they faintly smiled.

"You would have made a good member of my Order," they said. "Very well. If you want to slay Iola and rescue your uncle... there is, perhaps, a power you can wield."
