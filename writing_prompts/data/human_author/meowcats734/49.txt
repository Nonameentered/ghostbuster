**Macklenn was a witch.** Emphasis on the *was*â€”she'd planned on retiring two decades ago, when the last great war between good and evil broke out and the Silent Crusade came boiling out of the mountains to kill everyone in sight. She'd been a part of the heroic final stand that had ground their armies into dust, and she'd still had enough foolishness in her bones to think that meant things were over.

But no. The only thing final about war was the corpses it left behind. Once the crusaders had been beaten back, that just meant it was time to *rebuild*, and bandit kingdoms and raider parties from neighboring countries would have been bad enough if it weren't for the *economic* consequences of dumping an entire generation of battle-shocked soldiers onto the ravaged remains of the plains. One thing after another just kept happening, and... well, Macklenn was still kicking, whether she wanted to or not.

"It's like frog legs, you see," Macklenn grumbled.

"Frog legs," Mr. Klistro politely repeated.

"Yeah, they've got them in those museums down by the Crystal Coast. Frog legs." Macklenn angrily stabbed the ground with her cane, gesticulating at the distant knot of enemy soldiers. "They just keep kicking."

"They just keep kicking," Mr. Klistro diplomatically agreed. "Have you taken your medicine today?"

"Oh, hush, I've got witchcraft to do. Never did like taking medicine on witchcraft days." Macklenn's expression smoothed out as she regarded the black-and-white insignia of the distant soldiers. They were just foolish little kids who happened to be born in the wrong place, Macklenn knew. But that didn't change the fact that they were here to enact a massacre worse than the first time the Silent Peaks had boiled over, and if someone didn't stop them, they'd pillage town after town looking for something that nobody had.

"I never did like playing the hero," Macklenn muttered. The cat perched on her shoulder meowed in agreement, and she absently gave it a pat. She raised her hand, and although there was nothing physically there, she was a witch. The memory of a knitting needle, long since broken, shimmered in her hand. "Too many people dying side-by-side. And I ain't keen to be next."

She focused her fear, her craft, and blood snuck from her soul into the memory of the needle. "So I'm sorry for taking you all out like this. Truly, I am. But... fighting a war's a business that kills the young. And I'm old. So, so old." Her voice grew soft and quavering as the needle filled to its tip with power. "Old like you'll never know."

Then with a flick of her hand, she sent the blood-soaked memory towards the cluster of soldiers.

There was no sound. No warning. Just a sphere of darkness that engulfed the invaders.

When it faded, there was nothing left but dust.

Macklenn took in a deep breath, then turned. "Alright. That's one group down. Reports say there are three more on the western front that I can reach today." She stumped away, leaning on her cane. "Time to be a hero, my own damn way."

"Your own damn way," Mr. Klistro agreed, following the ancient witch.
