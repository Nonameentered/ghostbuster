# Soulmage

**It had been a child, once.** But so had all monsters. The ghoul had been buried for so long that its bones had begun to fossilize, the child-skeleton's sightless grin crusted over with mineral deposits laid down over the centuries.

Unfortunately, that didn't make it any less deadly. The ghoul would happily feast on my soul if it got within striking distance—and, judging by the corpses I'd passed on the tunnels here, it had already done the same to a handful of hapless civilians. I'd have to take it out before it could hurt anyone else.

The ghoul was bent over its latest kill, still feasting on the soul fragments of the dead, but I knew it would turn to me as soon as I got close. As far as I knew, ghouls were blind—they didn't have anything remotely resembling eyes, anyway—so I channeled joy from my soul to create a clear, strong ball of light. The stone tunnel quivered with shadows as I snuck closer.

Too close, evidently. The ghoul's skull swiveled towards me (did it have *two* sets of teeth? Did baby skulls normally have that many teeth?) and I swore, holding out one hand. Passion rippled across the surface of my soul, transmuting into a heatwave strong enough to fracture even the half-stone skeleton of the ghoul—

"Are you my mommy?" the ghoul asked, tilting its head.

I hesitated mid-spell, keeping a wary eye on the ghoul. "What?" I dumbly said.

"Are you my mommy?" the ghoul repeated.

That... Cautiously, I lowered my hand. That shouldn't be happening. Ghouls weren't sapient—they didn't have enough of a soul *left* to speak. "No," I warily said. "I am not your mommy."

"I..." The ghoul shivered. "I want my mommy."

Wait. I narrowed my eyes, opening my soulsight. *Ah.* Of course. The thing that had once been a child had been gorging on the souls of others—under the right circumstances, that could give it enough of a soul that it could become... something alive. Not the same entity that the child had been, however many aeons ago they had died, but... something, perhaps, worthy of talking to. "I'm very, very sorry," I carefully said, "but your mommy isn't here. She hasn't been here for... a long, long time."

The ghoul paused.

"I want my mommy back," it repeated, more forcefully this time. Its soul shook, threatening to destabilize, and I backed up.

"Your mommy's gone," I repeated. "It's okay. I can help explain what—"

"I want my mommy back!" And quick as a blur, the ghoul shot towards me. I was ready, though, and I sent a pulse of insecurity into the ground, weakening it, transforming it beneath the ghoul's feet. All the supernatural strength in the world wouldn't do it any good if there wasn't anything for it to push off of—it crashed through the suddenly-unstable stone seconds before I reversed the transformation, entombing it beneath the earth once more.

"I..." Despite being half-buried, the ghoul was still speaking. "I want my mommy," the soul of a long-dead child said.

I stepped forwards. "Shh, shh, shh. It's okay."

"I want my mommy."

"I know."

"I want my mommy."

"You'll see her soon."

I walked as close as I dared to the entombed spirit.

Then I drew forth magic from my soul one last time, sending unbridled, pure heat into the bones of the ghoul.

The ghoul's skeleton fractured, then burned, then reduced to ash and memory.

The soul that had once been a child, set free by the flame, shortly followed.

I knelt by the remnants of the ghoul for a moment longer. Heat wafted up from below, carrying with it the last of the long-dead body.

Then I stood to leave, bringing the corpses the child had made with me.
