**"If you could have any wish you wanted,"** my nephew asked, "what would it be?"

"I'd want to be able to fly," Lucet whispered. My nephew's quasi-girlfriend was a slim, shy girl, but she looked up across the table at the rest of us to speak. "It's... y'know. Simple. Freeing. Good."

"There's only one real answer to that question," Meloai said. "You wish for infinite wishes. It's a strict superset of anything you could possibly want."

"Okay, yeah, but there's such a thing as having *too* much power, you know?" Lucet said. "All I'm saying is, people who get too much power... change. It's not good for them. I just want to have something for myself. Something I can enjoy. Y'know?"

Cienne turned to me, curious. "What about you, Uncle Sansen?"

I hesitated, then said, "I'd wish I could speak to animals."

Meloai and Cienne gave me confused looks, but of the three of them, I think Lucet was closest to understanding. "Why?" Meloai asked. "I mean, any possible wish, and you choose that?"

"Well..." I closed my eyes and leaned back, remembering. "This was all before any of you were born, kids. But when I was a little boy, I had a pet dog. Aubrei. And he was the best dog anyone could ask for. And one day, he brought home something that he probably shouldn't have..."

"Aubrei!" I stared, aghast, at the nine-foot-tall swirling cyclone of formless purple in the living room. "What did you *do*?"

Aubrei didn't speak—he'd been oddly quiet as of late—but simply dropped a bottle on the ground, letting it roll towards me. Then, as if tired out by the exertion, he slumped over to his worn cloth bed, curling up into a ball.

"Master of my master," spoke the genie's booming voice, "Aubrei has seen fit to grant you a wish."

"Aubrei? My *dog?*" I paused. "Wait, what do you mean one? Don't you normally get three?"

The genie coughed awkwardly. "The first was used on asking how he could best benefit his master. The second one was used transferring the third to you."

Oh. I bit my lip. "This... this isn't a trick or a trap? I... I can get something—anything—that I want?"

"There are limitations," the genie acknowledged. "I am not omnipotent. But I will enact your commands to the best of my abilities."

"...Gosh." There was probably something better to say when faced with limitless cosmic power, but I was a teenager, and that meant I was a blithering idiot.

I turned to Aubrei, wondering if I should give the old dog a treat or something, but... I could do that myself. There was no sense spending a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity on that.

"In that case... er..." I swallowed. "You... nothing I say here will get to anyone else, right? Like, if I told you something... my parents wouldn't hear?"

The genie gave me a befuddled look. "After my wishes are granted, I shall return to my demesne in the Plane of Desire. It will likely be another century or two before I return to your world. It is *exceedingly* unlikely that your mortal parents will be alive then."

"Right, right, just... making sure." I took in a deep breath, then went for the plunge. If there was a chance, I had to take it. "My boyfriend and I..." I waited to see if the genie would react, but apparently being an extradimensional entity from beyond the planes meant that did not care one whit about human relationships. "We have to hide our relationship. And I wish that we didn't."

The genie tilted its head. "It will be done. Not today. Not all at once. But it will be done."

I exhaled. Right, not omnipotent. That was... that was still better than nothing. It was hope. "Thank you," I said.

The genie regarded me with an impassive look. "I do as I am commanded."

As the genie began to fade, I turned to Aubrei with a smile on my face. "You're a good boy, Aubrei. You're a good boy."

The old dog didn't move.

"Aubrei?" I frowned, walking towards his side. "Aubrei? Are you—"

I lifted up his limp, floppy neck, and something in my soul snapped in two.

"It was a string he'd eaten," I murmured. Even with my eyes still closed, I could feel the gaze of the three children on me. "It wrapped around his tongue and cut off the bloodflow, and it got infected. And none of us knew, because he just... kept it hidden. And even when he was dying, even when he must have been in agony, his last wishes were for me to be happy."

Memories of my husband and the slow, brutal, but *winning* battle we'd fought to stay together in the coming years drifted in and out of focus, and I said, "So yes. If I could have one wish, it would be that I could speak to him. That he could tell me about the string that was slowly killing him, before he became too sick to move, and that I could tell him what a good boy he was." In my mind's eye, my husband smiled. "That yes, in the end... he made me happy. Happier than he could ever know."

Silence fell around the dinner table. In the distance, wolves began to howl.

"Wherever you are, Aubrei," I finished, "I hope they don't have any fucking string."

And I listened to the howling of distant wolves, memories of lost friends sleeting across my soul.
