**"Grandma says that when** ***she*** **went to school, she had to walk uphill through the snow** ***both ways***," Dathenn complained. "There's no way that's real. It doesn't even snow here!"

"You claim to know much, for one so short-lived as you," Tav-nel-du-nerocan mused, flame streaking from her nostrils.

"Hey, no fair! I'm nearly eight! That's plenty old!"

"Actually, I was referring to your species," the ancient dragon murmured. "But yes, do lecture me about what is and is not possible."

"But how can you walk uphill *both ways*? It doesn't make sense!" Dathenn plopped down on the grass, lying down next to Tav-nel-du-nerocan. She was the oldest among the riftmaws in the Order of Valhalla, and was nearly the size of Dathenn's home village as she relaxed.

"The worlds were intertwined more closely, not more than a century ago," Tav-nel-du-nerocan explained. "Your witches played too carelessly with the skein between dimensions, and tore open a gate between here and the Plane of Elemental Cold. I watched your ancestors forge a home in those frozen lands—and yes, they walked uphill to enter one gate, and uphill to exit another."

"Huh." Dathenn picked his nose. "You're lying," he decided.

"What would I have to gain from such a trivial deception?" Tav-nel-du-nerocan wondered aloud.

"You can be mean to me. I know you like being mean."

"Child, I am ageless. As per the ancient agreement between Odin's folk and mine, when your body fails of natural causes, my kin will sup on your bones. There is no cruelty I could visit upon you that would meaningfully hasten the time between now and when my teeth cave in your cooling corpse's skull."

Dathenn stuck out his tongue. "See? Mean. Mean, mean, mean, mean, mean."

Tav-nel-du-nerocan exhaled in disgust—and perhaps a bit of amusement, despite herself—flattening the grassy fields with a wave of repulsive force. "Believe what you wish. I have heard many faiths more foolish."

Dathenn nodded, staring at the clouds. The slowly-mending rifts in the sky twinkled down at him, revealing slices of alien worlds.

Then Dathenn spoke once more, quieter this time.

"What was my mother like?"

Tav-nel-du-nerocan fell silent.

"I know you knew her," Dathenn said. "She was your dragonrider, and she died a long time ago."

"Not so very long ago," Tav-nel-du-nerocan whispered. "Not for one such as me."

"Can you tell me a story about her?" Dathenn asked.

Tav-nel-du-nerocan closed her emerald eyes, and for a moment, Dathenn was worried the old dragon had gone to sleep. It had been *months* until she woke up the last time.

What Dathenn could not have known was that the ancient dragon closed her eyes to hide what shone within them.

"...I suppose, child," Tav-nel-du-nerocan finally spoke. "Let me tell you a tale of a witch as fierce as she was kind, and the words she wielded that pierced even a dragon's heart. Let me tell you a tale of a woman named Quianna."
