**"And so we meet again,"** murmured the Dealmaker. Their barrel-chested, masculine body towered over me, and I felt as if they could reach out and snap me like a twig. But despite the power that the Dark Lord held, I wasn't afraid.

I was furious.

"*You*," I snapped. "Give me one good reason why I shouldn't dropkick your soul until it shatters into a thousand pieces."

The Dealmaker raised an eyebrow. "I would *very* much like to see you try."

I folded my arms, scowling. "Don't take me lightly. I'm no longer the helpless little boy you and my 'mentor' back at the Academy tried to manipulate into being your pawns. See, I've been thinking long and hard about this little game of ping-pong you and my mentor have been playing. Why fight over me? Why did the Academy spend the time and effort to drag me out from the ruins of my hometown, and why did the fucking Demon Lord try to steal me away from the Academy?"

"You aren't as special as you think you are," the Dealmaker said, but the confidence in their gaze had cooled into something steely and resolute. "I came here to make you one last offer. I know that you're looking for a lost friend. Stand by my side, and—"

"*I wasn't finished talking.*" My nails dug into my forearms as something hot and furious awoke inside me. "You know, once upon a time, I actually fell for your manipulative bullshit. Two months ago, if you'd asked for me to join your little army, I damn well might have agreed. But then you *fucking abandoned me*, and I had to learn how to fend for myself. And you know what I found out." I took in a deep breath. "I finally realized why you and the Academy were trying to get me on your sides, even though at the time, I had nothing."

The Dealmaker tensed. "And why would that be?"

"Because," I said sweetly, "there is no force more terrifying than a spellcaster with nothing left to lose."

And I unleashed the full force of my magic upon the Dealmaker.
