**"Watch it, knife-ear!"** The wagon driver hurled an overripe pear at Xio as the High Elf stumbled across the street. Xio caught the pear out of the air and took a bite from it. Mm, it had barely gone mushy. Ooh, and was that extra protein? The wagon driver gave Xio a horrified look as he chowed down on the unexpected treat.

"Thanks for the grub," Xio said. If he'd been speaking aloud, the mouthful of squelching pear would have made it difficult—but Xio was a High Elf, from across the Crystal Coast. He had no idea what language these humans spoke, and learning it manually didn't sound very fun. So he simply used his innate abilities to communicate with all plants and animals—humans were animals too, after all—and *thought* the concepts he wanted at the wagon driver. A memory of how delicious it felt to slurp down the maggoty, liquidy pear, combined with the sense of constant relaxation, gratitude, and oneness with the world that all High Elves felt, all day, every day.

The wagon driver paled, backing up, shouting words at Xio that were such a cumbersome way of communicating. Why bother with sound waves when you could just read souls? Disentangling the flurry of emotions vibrating along the string of magic connecting Xio and the driver, Xio figured that the driver was calling him an abomination of nature and a crime against all that was holy. Eh, figured. There were parts of the world where elves were revered, but the Crystal Coast wasn't one of them.

Undeterred by the chilly reception, Xio polished off the grub-riddled pear. It was just like the foraging back at home. The strings of magic that constantly flew out from Xio's wide-open soul grabbed at everything in range, not just the wagon driver—but Xio didn't mind. Sure, it was a cacophony, but it was at least a *different* cacophony from the placid single-mindedness of the trees or the minds of the forest animals when they were looking for mates. Human souls were so varied and fascinating. A boy's soul in a girl's body; a numbed heart, freshly thawed; a girl who seemed to have *built* her soul from a foundation of nothing—yes, Xio was glad he'd crossed the seas to enter the strange and foreign cities of the Crystal Coast.

Also, those three souls he'd noticed earlier were walking towards him. Mm. Xio took out a pouch of joyleaf, and stuffed it into a pipe, igniting it with a tinderbox.

"Yeah, there he is. Just like we were told." Xio frowned. How... strange. The boy's soul was... more open than most. It made him easier to Empathize with, even from this far away. "Uh, hey. We're looking for an elf named Xio?"

Xio exhaled a puff of joyleaf smoke, setting the boy to coughing. His two companions didn't seem to mind, though. "You've found him," Xio broadcast, sending out a rippling memory of him whispering his own name.

Every human within a tree's length of Xio flinched as the telepathic communication blinked into their minds. The boy cursed, looking around—then, to Xio's shock, his soul *shifted*. The gaps in his soul rotated, lining up like teeth of a gear, forming a solid tunnel to his soul's core. The boy's eyes glanced towards Xio—and, impossibly, towards the strings of magic connecting Xio to every mind around him.

Then, with a flicker from his soul and a pulse of eerie fog, the boy *severed* Xio's connection to the world around him.

Gaping, Xio stared at the boy—no. The *mage* before him, as he gave Xio a frown. He'd seen fit to leave the connection between Xio and himself, so at least Xio could understand him. "Sorry about the abrupt spellcasting, but, uh, it's... you've been causing a scene around town with your Empathy. I'm... I'm sorry, are you *smoking?*"

Xio shrugged, sending a twinned pair of concepts: a towering height, and the blissful empathy of joyleaf. If he had to state his intentions in natural language, he would have said: 'Why else would we be called High Elves?'

The mage stared at him, then shook his head. "You know what? I'm not even going to ask. But, uh, here's the deal. I'm working for the city right now, and... people aren't super happy with an uncontrollable Empath walking around the streets, blasting intrusive memories into their heads. So... you can either come with me peacefully, or—*whoa!*"

Xio sent forth a rapid flurry of thoughts—the constant irritation of the souls of animals and plants, the novel but still overwhelming sea of souls in the city, and now, finally, through the mage's spell, a single moment of *peace*, for the first time in his life. Come with him peacefully? He'd follow him for the rest of his life, if he had to.

The mage stared at him. "You mean... you can't *control* your empathy?"

Xio responded with every frustrated night kept up by bird-thoughts, every infuriating day wasted trying to find silence, even the anger and discomfort he'd caused in the city simply by *existing* with them.

"That..." The mage's soul shifted again, and Xio got the uncanny impression that those holes in his soul were *eyes*. "I... I think I see why your Empathy's out of control. And... I think I can help you *get* it under control. But... you'll need to cooperate. And there are some things about magic that I'll need to explain. Can you do that for me?"

Xio nodded enthusiastically, spreading his arms out for a hug.

The mage snorted. "I... uh, I'm going to take that as a yes. Alright. If you want to understand magic, you first have to understand souls. Here's what you need to know..."
