**"And the magical properties of salt?"** I asked. Of the many types of stones that were known to grant magical abilities, salt was the one I was confident Lucet was familiar with the most. 

"Salt is sorrow and frost," Lucet snapped. I didn't have to see the oil roiling in her soul—oil for passion and flame—to know that she was angry. "I *know* that, Cienne. Every Academy student knows the basic correspondences. It doesn't make me special. It doesn't mean I'm not *fucking useless*." She flicked a hand as she spoke, sending a jagged chunk of salt flying out from her soul. As always, the magical properties of the stone activated immediately, turning into a crackling frostbolt that left a trail of mist in the snowy air.

"You're not useless, Lucet," I pleaded. "You saved my life back at the Silent Peaks—the nurse said I would've died if you hadn't flash-cooled my injuries. And again when we were fighting Iola—if you didn't route us through the Plane of Elemental Frost, that eldritch abomination would have gotten us killed or worse."

"I didn't say I was *always* useless," Lucet said, clenching her fists. "That's the worst part. I used to be powerful. I used to be helpful. But now?" She gestured at me. "There isn't even a word for a mage who has as many schools of magic as you do. Don't pretend that I'm worth something because I can use salt. You can use salt, and quartz, and glass, and oil, and you've probably somehow picked up even *more* attunements when I wasn't looking. Sansen can see the future, Meloai doesn't need to eat or sleep, but me?" Lucet gestured at herself, oil and quartz rattling in her soul, and I wished so badly I could tell her how to unlock those powers for herself. But unless she had an attunement to the relevant emotions—passion for oil, determination for quartz—the resources in her soul would be useless to her.

As useless as she thought she was.

I stopped walking and turned to Lucet. The gently falling snow formed a haze around us, and it was as if we were the only two people in the world. "I can touch more magics than you, that's true," I said. "But that doesn't mean you're useless. You're smart, and determined, and kind, and you're a hundred times better with salt than I'll ever be, because you've worked hard on your specialty for every day of your life."

"..." Lucet closed her eyes, swallowing, and I felt the quartz-determination in her soul shift, the rivers of oil-fury slowing into a smoother passion.

And then I had an idea.

Acting on instinct, I asked, "Can I put my hand to your heart?"

She blinked. "What?"

"There's... something I want to try." I bit my lip. "I don't know if it'll work, but... I just... I just want you to know that you're *not useless*, and that I care about you so, so much. And... maybe there's a way for me to show you that."

Lucet tilted her head, her messy brown hair sliding away from her eyes. 

Then she nodded, taking my hand and placing it over her heart.

I closed my eyes, focusing on my soulsight. If I was casting a normal spell, I would have reached into my own soul, accessing the many materials stored within—but I was trying something different.

I focused my will and touched Lucet's soul instead, picking up two pieces of quartz-determination, lifting them out of the river of thick, flammable oil.

"I know what it's like," I whispered. "To be overshadowed. To be inadequate. To never be *enough*. Not for the people around you, but for the voices in your head."

And as I spoke, I struck the two crystals of quartz against each other.

*Clack.*

"My first attunement wasn't to sorrow, or to determination, or even to shame. I didn't wield salt or quartz or glass." My fingers clenched, just a little bit, and Lucet laid her hand on mine. "When I first learned magic, I was a witch of self-hatred."

*Clack.* 

"So trust me when I tell you that *I understand.* That I *know* what it's like when even praise of your abilities feels like salt on an open wound, that if the people around you think you are beautiful and brilliant and *good* that it is simply because you've *tricked* them somehow, and that they'll hate you even more for it when they realize how useless you really are. I get it." I pressed my forehead against her chest, feeling her heartbeat sync with mine. "And I get how determined you have to be to keep going anyway."

*Clack. Clack. Clack.*

"And I love you, Lucet," I whispered. "Truly. I do. So please... see yourself how I see you. And trust me. Trust me enough to have faith that I'm right about you."

I struck the two quartz crystals against each other in Lucet's soul one last time, letting out a fountain of sparks.

And the oil in her soul caught fire. Beautiful, brilliant, ethereal fire, a magic that I could not see or touch or hear except when I closed my eyes and opened my mind—but wasn't that where all the most powerful magics lived, anyways?

I opened my eyes, letting my soulsight fade as I returned to mundane reality, and even though her soul was hidden from me, the fires of hope danced bright in her eyes as she gave me a wavering, growing smile. 

She held her arms out, and I embraced her, her warmth beating back the icy cold.

"I love you too, Cienne," Lucet whispered, her breath tickling my ear.

And the flames in her soul kept the darkness at bay as the two of us embraced in the storm.
