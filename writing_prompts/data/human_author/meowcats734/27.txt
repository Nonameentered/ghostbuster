**"It's all yours,"** the Demon of Empathy said, handing me a fistful of soul shards.

I stared at them, mouth slightly open. The Demon of Empathy tilted their head, and I got the feeling that you didn't need to be a sapient personification of the concept of empathy in order to see my confusion. 

"Is something wrong?" the Demon of Empathy prompted.

I took a hesitant step back. The dream that I'd summoned the Demon of Empathy into wasn't really made of anything, per se, but it was solid enough under my feet as I backed away. "The last time you just gave me what I wanted without a fight, you threw me into a nightmarish clockwork hell dimension."

The Demon of Empathy nodded. "True. That is also what you requested, and exactly what I said I'd do."

"*I assumed you'd give me a way to get back out!*"

"Yes, and your assumptions are not my responsibility," the Demon of Empathy said. "As much as I care about you, Cienne, I have far bigger problems than an uppity teenager asking for help against some nebulous threat you don't even understand."

"His name is Zhytln," I said, "and he's doing... something awful... to people's souls."

"Yes, I'm quite familiar with the man. I would be unable to offer you help if I wasn't." The Demon of Empathy concentrated, and suddenly, we had always been sitting in a cozy log cabin, endless plains of golden grass waving outside the window. "I am a Demon of *Empathy*, Cienne. I know very well what your enemy is doing—every time one of his corrupted souls falls into my domain, I relive their lives as if they were my own. If I was not otherwise occupied in the war against the Silent Peaks, I would strike down Zhytln on my own. But as I am otherwise occupied... the least I can do is give you knowledge of what you're dealing with." The Demon of Empathy opened their palm, and the soul fragments they'd offered me shone. "I give you these souls freely, so that you may learn from their demise—and, with luck, avoid suffering the same fate."

I met the Demon of Empathy's eyes, crinkled with weariness and pain. I knew, now, that they truly did care for those under their protection.

And I knew that they would be ruthless in eradicating any threat to those they loved as their own.

I held out my hand, taking the Demon of Empathy's hand in mine, and took in a sharp breath as a soul not my own flowed up my hand and into my heart.
