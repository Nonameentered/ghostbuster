**I always had loved the stars.** Even as a baby, my first words were (while pointing at the North Star) "I want to be up there!" According to my mother, of course; this was seventy years back, when I was still alive and still a child and still too young to remember the precious things that would one day be all I had left.

I never did reach the stars. I lived and died a butler to some minor nobleman—excuse me, *his Lordship Tanryn, third of his name*—and never even got to kiss that pretty boy who lived down the street.

Mm. That pretty little boy was now a kindly old man. I'd followed him out from the basement where I'd died, where I'd stayed in stasis for decades, and saw the stars for the first time since I'd entered Lord Tanryn's service. And bit by bit, week by week, the little bits of a child that had once wanted to see the stars... remembered.

I was nothing but a memory now. I had weight only if I believed I did. That child's wish upon a star could at last come true.

It was slow going, at first. Say what you would about haunting the living, but at least it was never boring. The clouds were pretty from below, and then from above, but staring at the endless sea of fluffy white got a bit repetitive eventually. I'd stayed stuck in a basement for the better part of two decades, though, so it was, at the very least, a nice change of scenery. 

Idly, some part of me wondered why more ghosts didn't try this at least once in their lives. Unlives. Afterlives. The proper terminology for what laid beyond the veil was not part of my education as a butler. Where was I? Ah, yes. The streaks of darkness were so mesmerizing, the stars that blinked like eyes, the creatures that flitted just beyond where air and light ended so tempting to join—

I jolted out of my trance, finding myself floating in the void between earth and sun, surrounded by dark, drooling, *hungry* shapes.

Ah. So that was why no ghosts came up here. 

Something else had gotten there first.

The things from beyond the stars lashed out at me, strange spiracles and tendrils of void reaching out to strike. I remembered I had weight and dropped like a stone, but the predators between worlds must have expected that—four excellently aimed lances like the tines of a salad fork speared my soul, and I felt the entities from the void eat at the memories that were all I had left. There went the day I first looked up at the stars. That was the name of the boy I never got to kiss. Farewell, proper ordering of the spoons and forks on a well-set table.

Somehow, that last thing made me angriest of all. Take away my childhood dreams, take away my one-time crushes, but I. Was. A. *Butler.* Eldritch abominations from beyond the void or not, *nobody* took that from me.

I closed my eyes and remembered that, once upon a time, I had lived inside a mansion.

And the ghostly form of Lord Tanryn's estates crashed into existence around me, swatting the eldritch entities away like a spider beneath a flyswatter.

The memory I had left behind dissipated within moments, more hungry mouths of darkness consuming them, but I held onto myself as I plummeted back to earth. There was one last thing I had to do. One final service to the living I could still provide.

I had to warn them. Had to warn them about the things beyond the stars.

The clouds parted beneath me, the world fading into view. My memories were bleeding from my stricken soul, but I held on to those last moments for just a little longer. The length of a waltz. That was all I needed to hold myself together for. Just the length of a waltz.

The boy whose name I would never know, the boy who'd grown up into a wry old man while I was dead, was walking along a road with three children in a wide, fertile plains. I would slip through the ground and plummet forever if I didn't do something—but the one thing I could do would surely end me for good. Ghosts didn't leave ghosts, after all.

Ah well. I was a butler. It was in my nature to serve.

I remembered the earth, its solidity and form, and I splattered against the ground exactly how a living human who'd fallen from the sky would.

The man who'd once been a boy jumped, looking around, one eye glowing strangely, and I could have sworn he saw me. No matter. I grinned weakly and strained to whisper the last letter I'd ever run delivery for.

"*Do not venture beyond the stars.*"

Then my soul shattered like a poorly-handled chalice, and I faded into the infinite dream of oblivion.

The things between the stars had gotten me. My leg of the journey was over.

It was in the hands of the living now.
