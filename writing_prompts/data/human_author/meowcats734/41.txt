**"Welcome back,"** said Josh. "Now, I know it's been... what, three years, since I've last made a video? And the thing you guys are all wondering is, 'wow, where has Josh been?'"

"No, Josh, we have *not* been wondering that. Our chickens have been flourishing without you," the village elder muttered under his breath. I gave Elder Thames a confused look, but he just shook his head, gesturing for me to get away from the main road. "This was before your time, kid. You're a 3.2 child; you wouldn't remember Josh."

"Oh. My. Gosh." I couldn't resist, and peeked over the edge of the porch. A man in plate armor was tromping towards the farm. Elder Thames sighed. "Chickyk-chicky-chicky-*chickens*! Let me see if I can pick these guys up—"

There was a click of a key, a *crunch*, and then the chicken was gone.

"—oops, that's the 'eat' button. Man, that video got thirty-three million views. You'd think the developers would've fixed that by now." I recoiled in horror, but Elder Thames gave me a reassuring pat on the back.

"We're quest-givers, remember? He can't hurt us. Other than by scarring my little boy for life by *swallowing a live chicken whole*." Elder Thames grumbled. "We were doing just fine without you. Megabad the Evil doesn't do more than send the odd raider party our way, and the golems take care of that."

"Ah, that brings back memories." Considering that he'd just swallowed a live chicken, Josh was... surprisingly calm. Melancholy, even. He started tromping towards us, and I whimpered. Was he going to eat *me*? "Well, I guess I should get to the topic of the video. After all, that's probably what I'm going to be titling it, after all, 'Where's Josh Been,' heh. So. Where have I been, indeed."

The man in plate armor strode up to Elder Thames and made an aborted motion, then checked himself. "Oops. 'Eat' button again. Let's see... Megabad the Evil, raider party... yeah, I remember this. So, uh. I feel a little silly making this a Let's Game video, but... I'm a Let's Game Youtuber. So I guess I'll get to the point."

Elder Thames started speaking, the fluid quest instructions and motions that he was created with washing over my ears as I listened to Josh. 

"I... have cancer," Josh said. "Now, uh, don't worry, I'm getting the best medical care in the world. But it's why I've been absent so much lately, and one thing piled up after another, and I couldn't quite find the time to make a video. So... I figured I'd do something simple. A tribute, of sorts. To whence I came." Behind that plate armor, I could almost hear Josh smiling. "So let's eat some chickens and kick some Megabad butt, eh? One last time. For ol' Josh."

Elder Thames finished his speech. "A great evil is coming, and only you can stand against it. Will you rise? Will you rage against the darkness?"

Josh nodded once, and his character's voice overlapped with his as he spoke two words. 

"I will."

A.N.

I miss him.
