**There's always a bigger monster.**

I wouldn't lie, our ragtag little adventuring party didn't have a spotless moral history, especially if you knew where to look. Meloai was a shapeshifter who ate souls, Sansen was a werewolf, Lucet was a witch, and I... well, I had enough things to hate about myself without going digging for more. Labelling us as monsters wouldn't be hard for someone who was cherry-picking their facts, who ignored Meloai's calm, logical curiosity or Sansen's world-weary wisdom or Lucet's grief and drive to be better. Someone who saw us for the boxes he could fit us in, instead of who we were.

Someone who stood in front of us, skin bubbling as he smiled a fleshy grin.

The bigger monster.

"Iola," I said, stepping forwards and glaring at the abomination that once was a boy. His body ran like molten wax on a stove, shifting and hissing as he tilted his head at me, three-lobed eyes shimmering with some distant cousin to curiosity. "We don't want to fight. Leave us alone, and we'll return the favor."

"Leave you alone?" Iola staggered backwards, feet leaving cloven footprints in the snow, one dripping hand clasped to his mouth in exaggerated shock. "*Leave* you *alone*? Why, my good friends! I couldn't possibly leave you alone in the cold!" He gestured around to the wintry storm, inhuman eyes wild. "No. No, no, *no*, my friends. Sit a while. Let me... warm you up."

Iola's arms spread wide, frog-webbing and mucus splayed between his limbs, and I narrowed my eyes.

"Meloai," I whispered. The shapeshifter's ears swiveled towards me. "That favor I asked? Now's the time."

Meloai nodded.

Then, without warning or declaration, she blurred forwards at inhuman speeds, body *click-click-clicking* as she lunged at Iola.

I focused my soulsight, watching the flows of magic as Iola registered the threat and turned to face it. His soul was a mess of mold and tar and spider's eggs, and he laughed with a disgustingly wet glee, as if he was expecting the attack all this time. His soul shifted, and he fired a beam of deadly, invisible light, that would sicken any mortal flesh it struck, riddling the body with burns and tumors. It was a weapon suitable for a monster of Iola's caliber.

But Meloai's flesh was not mortal, and we had monsters of our own, too.

Meloai descended upon Iola in a flurry of metal and flesh, shrugging off the blasts of invisible light. I reached into my own soul, drawing forth lines of blood, and wove a hasty spell of darkness to soak up any residual light that might glance our way. I couldn't make a shield that would stand up to a total onslaught from Iola, but with Meloai drawing his attention, I could make do.

"My turn," I whispered, and from my soul I called forth *fire*.

The soulfire was intangible to the physical realm, homing in on Iola's soul like an arrow striking home. *Exactly* like an arrow striking home—I'd used the memory of an arrow to shape the spell. The comet of soulfire phased through Meloai's body harmlessly, hitting Iola's tar-ridden, spiderwebbed, mossy, *very flammable* soul square on.

And the monster's soul *burned*.

Iola howled in fury as his soul—and, by extension, his magic—ignited. His eldritch flesh still regenerated faster than Meloai's blurringly-fast limbs could tear it apart, but without his magic, nothing in Iola's toolbox could so much as scratch the shapeshifter. Body and soul locked down, I turned to Lucet.

She was already striding forwards, flicking her hands with delicate little conductor's motions. Her expression was stony and implacable and as cold as the bolts of pure frost she hurled at Iola's body, ripping the heat from him in lines and chunks, shutting off even his impossible regeneration. 

And for one moment, it all came together as I'd planned. Shapeshifter, witch, and soulmage, locking down Iola's body, mind, and soul. For one glorious moment, I thought our victory would be as quick and clean and easy as dropping a mimic down a chasm.

Then something in the monster's soul went *hiss*, and my eyes widened.

I'd set his soul on fire because it was such a beautifully flammable target. Tar and spiderwebs and moss all went up gloriously.

But... I'd never really made sure that that was *all* that was in the eldritch monster's soul.

Iola's face was a half-frozen, sloshing mess, and Meloai cut it to pieces as fast as it could melt back together. But I still locked eyes with the monster for half a heartbeat, and the cheeky little bastard *winked*.

Then he brought gunpowder to the surface of his soul, and the explosion of magic threw three lesser monsters back as the original deal stood, laughing with the glee of a kid in a butcher's shop.
