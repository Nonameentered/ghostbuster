# Endless Worlds Most Beautiful

**The Blackbone Space Fountain was a monument to the past.** Erected after the First World War by the united efforts of the sixty-two victorious countries, it was the peak of Stonekin engineering. Every single pellet in the particle stream that kept the Blackbone Space Fountain aloft was engraved with the name of a soldier—or worse, a civilian—that had been massacred by the Osseocracy. It was a historic, century-old reminder to never again repeat the mistakes of the past.

And today, High King Walks-On-Diamonds ordered it dismantled.

"But—my lord." Advisor Where-The-Second-Largest-Tectonic-Plate-On-The-Planet-Subducts-Creating-Large-Basaltic-Plains hurried their rolling in order to catch up with their High King. "The Blackbone Space Fountain is more than our anchor to history—it's a vital part of our economy. Let me speak with the humans. I'm sure their demands to dismantle it are a translation error."

"Firstly, you're one to speak of translation errors. Apparently, your name turns into something of *absurd* length in the human language. Secondly, this wasn't a demand made by the humans—it's a decision I've made myself, in order to appease them. And *thirdly*, the cost of taking down that ancient space fountain is nothing compared to the riches we will receive if we manage to trade the secret of interstellar travel with the humans." High King Walks-On-Diamonds sweated drops of magma just thinking about it. "No, I'm afraid your objections are overruled, Advisor. If the humans know our species is capable of such horrors as the Osseocracy, they will *certainly* be leery of handing us the tools to join the larger galactic community."

"High King, you don't understand," the Advisor pleaded. "Our linguists are still decoding what we've received from the humans, but our cultural exchange program thinks... that our theory about the origin of the humans is wrong."

Walks-On-Diamonds paused, the magmatic currents that powered their cognition churning and shifting in consternation. "What do you mean?"

"We originally thought that they were an artificial life-form. Surely, no carbon-based life could have evolved from base components. They'd hardly be able to touch lava without incinerating; it seems much more likely that they were the perfected creation of a naturally-evolved, silicon-based lifeform. And their peaceful and benevolent demeanor seemed to bear out that hypothesis. But..." The Advisor hesitated, then went for it. "It seems they weren't always that way."

"What?" Walks-On-Diamonds leaned in, trying to better absorb the patterns of rippling minerals that the Advisor used to communicate. "Did you make a breakthrough in deciphering the historical texts they sent us?"

"We did. And... it seems like the humans were... similar to us, once. Not anymore," the Advisor hastened to add. "But—and this is a key part—they managed to move on from genocide and war *because* they remembered the past, and learned from it. And... if you truly want them to trust us, you should too."

High King Walks-On-Diamonds regarded their advisor for a long, volcanic heartbeat.

Then they let out a rueful puff of silicon. "Feh. I must be getting senile in my old age, but... I'll hear you out. But if they get mad about Blackbone, there's no way we're telling them about what our citizens do on the Internet."

"Ah. About that." The Advisor winced. "Let me tell you about the... *other*... cultural texts we decrypted. It seems like the humans are, ah, a little *too* much like us in some ways..."

So! I'm in a bit of a dilemma. People seem to have liked this and want a Part II, but I'm sick and have another project (my webserial [Soulmage](https://www.reddit.com/r/bubblewriters/comments/uxmwe4/soulmage_masterpost/?sort=new)) and I won't be able to get it out today. As such, if you want to know when a Part II comes out, check out [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bubblewriters/comments/vnuh9j/ewmb_we_are_meeting_an_advanced_benevolent_alien/).
