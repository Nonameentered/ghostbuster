**After the kiss in the treehouse, I was told to stay away from Sansen.** "If I see that little shit seducing my son ever again," Dad had growled, having sprinted down from the second story where he'd been watching. "I'll throw his ass in the harbor with a pair of steel boots."

And Dad tried to tear down the treehouse Sansen and I had built with our own two hands. Some part of me was darkly amused as Dad struggled with the hefty wooden planks we'd spent weeks sawing together, the care and craft of our hands defying Dad's hacksaw until the end. Until Dad, unable to tear the treehouse from its foundations, uprooted the tree itself in a fit of rage, sawing at its trunk for a day and night until it came crashing down and the garbage people had to haul it away.

I wondered if there'd be two more loads for them to haul away after tonight, or if Dad would do their job for them and sink us in the harbor.

"He doesn't," Sansen said, legs dangling off the side of the boat. Dad was a paranoid freak, but even he couldn't track a canoe in the middle of the ocean.

"Doesn't what?" I asked, lying down with my back to his.

"Your father. He doesn't kill us."

"How do you know?" 

"I can see the future." Even though I was turned away from him, I could hear Sansen's smile, brighter than the midday sun. "We get out of here, one day. We move somewhere safe. Somewhere far." He sniffed at his armpit, glanced up at the sun, then added, "Somewhere less sweaty."

I chuckled. "If you say so," I said.

"I hope so," he replied. His fingers found mine, right where he expected them to be, and our hands intertwined as the boat rocked gently on the seas.

"And we build a house," Sansen continued. "Not just a treehouse. A real one, that nobody can tear down. A house that's safe and tall and proud."

I never knew whether to believe Sansen when he said he could see the future. But here and now, the burning hope he felt... it was hard not to catch alight, too.

"I wish I could see that future, too," I whispered.

Sansen squeezed my hands. "You do. I promise, Jiaola, you do."

The two of us leaned on each other beneath the unforgiving sun, our only reprieve from the heat being the lapping of the waves at our toes.
