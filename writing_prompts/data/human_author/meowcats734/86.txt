A while back I was in a conversation with the mod team during a ban appeal, and part of the agreement was that I'd write stories that aren't connected to the rest every now and then, as well as staying away from writing connected stories in \[PI\] posts. Which seems sensible to meâ€”I probably would've written stories that aren't connected to the rest every now and then anyways, since there are some great prompts that simply don't fit the world I'm writing for.
