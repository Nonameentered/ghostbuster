**"Bit of an insensitive slogan,"** I mused as Burn waved at the cheering crowd. "For someone who claims to stand for witches, you'd think he'd have a little more historical awareness."

"There hasn't been a witch burning on the Crystal Coast since before the Outer rifts opened," Meloai said, trying to peer over the shoulders of the nearby citizens. "Even with the lifespans of demons, I doubt there's more than a handful of people alive who remember them firsthand."

"Here." I held out a hand, willing feathers from my soul into the air, and a burst of wind lifted Meloai off the ground so that she could see. Ordinarily, it probably wouldn't be a great idea to sling spells around in the middle of a public plaza, but there were more magic-users in the crowd than not. My little wind spell was quickly joined by a bevy of lights and whistles; ever the politician, Burn added his own magic to the mix, casting a shimmering vision of potential futures into the sky. 

"For too long," Burn said, once the flurry of spells had quieted down, "the magical potential of Knwharfhelm's population has gone untapped. But with new techniques imported from the Silent Peaks, we have discovered that *anyone* can become a witch, with the proper training and knowledge. I propose the opening of a grand public initiative: to allow anyone who wishes it to access the powers of magic."

"That's an interesting move," Meloai remarked, over the wild roar of the crowd. "Burn's primary voter base is the magical population, and his primary opponents are the mundane citizenry; proposing to throw his influence behind something that explicitly benefits everyone who doesn't already have an attunement to magic seems like a counterintuitive way to get votes."

"There's strategy in it," I said. "But... more importantly, there's... just... well. You're right. It's not a politically optimal move. It's building an educational system that will help the people who oppose him more than those who support him. And it's... kind." I allowed myself a faint smile. "A government that's more interested in helping its citizens than prosecuting them for things they can't control. Now that's a nice change of pace, for once."

Meloai slowly nodded. "We should talk with the others first, but... I think... this might be a good place to stay. A place for people like us."

The two of us, witch and demon, chased from home after home and battlefield after battlefield, watched Burn's speech wind to a close as he promised safety and opportunity for all the lost souls he could gather to his cause.

Then we turned away, to bring the rest of our family home.
