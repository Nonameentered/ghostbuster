**Lying down on the beach, watching the moon reflect off the gently lapping waves, it was hard to remember that everyone here was an unrepentant murderer.** Hristov had stabbed a parent who was just trying to defend his home, Crunch had rigged an inhabited apartment to collapse in order to profit off the reconstruction contracts, and Daienn had trapped a family inside a burning building when they'd gotten too close to uncovering the comings and goings of the Lattice. I'd managed to mitigate the damage—evacuating the apartment and hauling the Taliel family out from their sealed, burning home respectively—but it wouldn't do to forget that the Lattice were a *criminal* crew, first and foremost.

It was just... they were people, too.

"This is the best barbecue I've ever had," I said, giving Daienn an appreciative nod. I didn't even have to fake the emotions—other than a bit of unease about having the arsonist do the barbecuing, I genuinely was shocked by how crispy and flaky a simple salmon steak could get.

"Oh, you bet it is. I used to run a grill, back in the day," Daienn said. His eyes narrowed slightly, a hint of grief creeping across his expression. "That was back before the rent ceiling, of course. Can't have a business if nobody's willing to give you so much as a room to cook from."

I grimaced. That was part of the problem. The government wasn't actively malicious—they'd sent me into the Lattice to find out *why* criminal gangs were multiplying like rabbits in spring. And in the meetings that followed, we'd even come up with a pretty darn solid theory. Some misinformed policymaking combined with a land shortage sent housing prices skyrocketing, and cultural discrimination against homeless people meant that crime was often the only way to survive for the people who fell between the cracks. Policy reforms had been put in place, shelter initiatives had been opened, and in short, all the boring government nonsense that actually worked would solve the problem in another twenty or thirty years.

But that didn't help Daienn, and it didn't help me.

"Want to know something interesting?" Crunch asked. Her bright, curious expression reminded me of Meloai, and seeing an echo of my dearest friend in a criminal mastermind made my head and heart and soul ache. "Statistically speaking, you actually would've killed *more* people as a chef than as an arsonist, at least while you were working for us. Averaging the lifetime cancer increase from cooking over a charcoal grill, you would've killed 8.6 more people if you'd never found us."

We called her Crunch because she crunched the numbers. In another lifetime, she would've been a brilliant engineer. Now... she was Crunch, and she had killed more people with a pencil and paper than a career soldier would in a lifetime.

"Or he could've killed only one," Hristov murmured. "And then nobody else, ever again."

The Lattice fell silent. Hristov was the man on the ground, and we—*they*—sent him in whenever someone needed to get their hands dirty.

I closed my eyes. The correct thing to do, I knew, would be to report my findings on the contract fraud the Lattice committed to stay housed and fed. The loophole would be closed, they'd all be thrown in prison, and by the time they were released, society would be a better place. There would be a space for them that let them take full advantage of their abilities, without resorting to crime.

But that was then, and this was now.

The ring on my finger made an almost-imperceptible buzz. It was a wordless question from my superiors. *Had I learned everything I needed to know? Or was it time to call the operation to a close?*

I took in a deep breath.

Then I sat up, twisting my ring with an idle motion.

*No. There is still more to learn.*

And I dined with murderers, arsonists, and frauds, desperately trying to find a way to keep them from getting anyone else hurt.

Including, most of all, themselves.
