**The blizzard was harsh enough to be felt even through a dragon's scales, and Ekrikri-sam-toulkvei wanted nothing more than to roost.** But he had made a promise to a woman named Quianna, so many years ago.

*"Keep him safe," Quianna whispered. "Love her like she was your own."*

*Ekrikri-sam-toulkvei rested one claw, delicately, on the baby's tuft of hair. "Knowing that she is yours is enough."*

And as the years passed, so much had changed. The child born a girl had discovered himself a boy. The village of Quianna's birth had turned against dragons, even more so than it had when Ekrikri-sam-toulkvei had found a brave and kind woman offered as sacrifice to his cave. And so Ekrikri-sam-toulkvei had stayed a cautious distance away from Quianna's son, only intervening in times of great crisis, never letting himself be caught.

Because the world was not kind to dragons, and Ekrikri-sam-toulkvei knew that if he revealed himself, he would be taken for an enemy. So he thanked the blizzard for its cover even as it weighed down his wings with sorrowful frost.

Quianna's son—Cienne, he'd chosen for his name—had hurled himself headfirst into the most dangerous situation he possibly could, all for the sake of saving a friend. He had inherited that much from his mother, Ekrikri-sam-toulkvei thought. The blizzard was a death zone, filled with eldritch nightmares and blinded, enraged soldiers who would cut Quianna's bloodline in two if they had the chance.

So Ekrikri-sam-toulkvei never gave them that chance. He watched the souls of a rogue party of soldiers as they neared Cienne's companions, and swooped upon them in fury and silence. Their only consolation was that in the unforgiving cold of the blizzard, they died warm. A thing of shifting flesh with too many teeth smelled prey and turned towards Quianna's son, but the vengeful dragon fell like the judgement of the stars, and though the shifting-thing escaped, Cienne lived another day.

But even a dragon's might could not last forever. As much as Ekrikri-sam-toulkvei fought to keep Cienne safe, slaying demons and raiders and eldritch things that Cienne would never know, he found his eyes fluttering, the fires of his soul guttering. He had been fighting for two weeks straight, and he knew his time was nearing.

He would have to sleep.

A dragon's slumber was not that of a mortal's. For months on end, nothing would wake him, even if he wished it. And he could not allow that. Not while Cienne still fought to make it through the storm. So even as Ekrikri-sam-toulkvei slowed, as his heartbeat told him it was time to hibernate, he growled and pinched and bit at himself to keep himself awake for just a heartbeat longer.

Until the space between his heartbeats became seconds, then minutes, then hours.

Until his wings refused to lift, and his eyes refused to open.

"I'm sorry, Quianna," Ekrikri-sam-toulkvei murmured. He tried to stand, but his mind was already half-dreaming. And though he struggled, though he *saw* what was coming for Cienne, his body refused to respond. "He'll have to handle this next part alone."

Perhaps it was a dragon's wishful thinking, perhaps it was the lull of his soul as he slept.

But the dragon thought he heard a long-dead voice whisper,

"*I forgive you.*"

And Ekrikri-sam-toulkvei fell into a dragon's slumber, until the storm blew out and the sun shone once more.

A.N.

I initially made a typo in which "cave" was spelled "cafe," resulting in "a brave and kind woman offered as sacrifice to his cafe." There's no moral here; it was just funny.
