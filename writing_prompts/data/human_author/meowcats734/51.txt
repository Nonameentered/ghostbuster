**"Thank you, thank you, very good showing from Galactismash the Conqueror."** Blearily, I blinked awake to the sounds of cheering and an announcer's voice. I was lying on my side, face half-buried in sand, trapped within the round walls of... an arena? I pushed myself to my feet; a mechanical behemoth was posing for the crowd, standing over the mangled corpse of a fleshy, draconic beast the size of a truck.

I gulped. Maybe... maybe if I stayed very, *very* still, the monstrous entity wouldn't notice me?

"And for our next combatant... we have the deadliest killer known to humanity. The scourge of the early twenty-first century. He who slays millions with but a single word. I present to you... *George.*"

The crowd went wild as I flinched. *George*? Wait, was he... was he talking about me?

"Now." A spotlight flickered on, a drone swooped down from above, and a black sphere that reminded me vaguely of a microphone protruded from it, extending towards my mouth. "Why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself, Scourge of Words?"

"Scourge of... what? No, uh, there's got to be some mistake. My name's *George*, first of all."

"Oh, we know. We know everything about you, George McCapri, greatest genocider in all of history."

"Genocide?" I laughed nervously. "What... no. No, you've got this all wrong. I wouldn't hrut a fly. Well, unless it was—Texas summers, you know? But—that's not—" Was that what this was about? Were these some kind of aliens that *really* hated it when people swatted flies?

"Oh, the numbers don't lie, George. You've killed six billion, two hundred and three million, nine hundred and eighty-one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-two point six eight four three people and counting."

"...point six eight four three? How do I kill six-tenths of a person?" I asked.

"Why, it's as simple as how you make *anyone* die a little. Social media," the announcer said. "George McCapri, you were the single most *prolific* spreader of disinformation and dangerous lies of the twenty-first century. You created four separate conspiracies, two of which grew into open violence; you eroded trust in proven systems, killing billions who bought into scams and lies; you provoked hatred and animosity towards people who had done no wrong, robbing the world of countless talented people; and overall, the deaths traced back to you outnumber that of any human in history save for your ancestors, who regrettably share the burden of your existence. You, George McCapri, killed more people from behind a keyboard than any soldier ever did in the thousands of eons since your death. *You*, Scourge of Words, are the original monster." The drone leaned back, as if giving me time to catch my breath. "And this is your reward."

"GALACTISMASH... HUNGRY." The metal behemoth I had seen earlier turned towards me with a scrape of metal and gears.

"No. No, wait. I just—it was just words. It didn't mean—I didn't—" I scrambled backwards. This had to be a nightmare. I would pinch myself and I'd wake up and be back at my keyboard, waiting for the next person to pay me to stir up some meaningless trouble on the internet. I wouldn't—this couldn't—

"Goodbye, Scourge of Words," the drone murmured. "Let your next life be... less violent than this."

And the last thing I saw was twenty tons of metal bearing down on me, returning a fraction of the deaths and violence I'd caused.
