Thanks for the kind words! Yeah, I plan on taking an actual, formal break from my serial as soon as I finish up the current storyline. Both because I don't want to leave the people who read it hanging, and because I find it much easier to return to a project when it ends on a somewhat finished note, instead of in the middle of a story.
