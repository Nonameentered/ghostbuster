Thanks for the kind words! In terms of follow-up, [here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/bubblewriters/comments/vh57ri/soulmage_a_panicked_scream_of_is_anybody_here_a/) the beginning of Cienne's journey through the blizzard, told from his perspective; [here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/bubblewriters/comments/vxjujn/soulmage_your_party_accidentally_enrages_a_god/) its end, with Cienne clashing with Iola, the entity Ekrikri-sam-toulkvei saw coming but was unable to stop.

These are both in the middle of a larger story, collectively known as Soulmage; if you want to read the entire thing for context on who Iola, Ekrikri-sam-toulkvei, and Cienne are, the whole story is collected [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bubblewriters/comments/uxmwe4/soulmage_masterpost/?sort=confidence).

Hopefully that's enough follow-up for you!
