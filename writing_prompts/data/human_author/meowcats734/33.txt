**"There's no need to keep using an eyepatch,"** I told Odin. "It's primitive technology. I mean, a flap of cloth?"

Odin grunted, gesturing at the surrounding forest. It wasn't real, of course—the meeting was, as traditional, taking place in a dream—but it was real enough for our purposes. "It does what I need it to. I am hardly prone to infection; I wear an eyepatch because I can tell most people find it... unsettling... to look at the remains of a gouged-out eye."

"Well, allow me to introduce you to the wonderful world of *prosthetics*." I concentrated, shaping the dream, and a floating eyeball materialized above my hand. "The finest modern enchanted glass I can offer. It doesn't *quite* provide real-time vision, but there's only a tiny amount of lag, and I'm sure the next model will fix that."

"I don't need a new eye," Odin responded. "It's a vanity project, and nothing else."

"True," I acknowledged. "But what can I say? I've gotten used to city living. You're allowed to spend on yourself every now and the—"

"I need weapons," Odin snapped, narrowing the one remaining eye, and I was abruptly reminded that the last time we'd met, Odin had *two*. "Cienne, I *know* you're capable of creating them. Your history speaks for itself."

"Oh, you want to go there?" I glared at Odin. "I'm done with war, Odin. No more grand storms. No more miracles. I've moved on from weapons. I'm sorry."

"You have no idea what horrors the Silent Peaks have unleashed," Odin growled. "You think that eldritch abominations are bad? The one you saw was a *juvenile*. If you want to stay out of war? Flee this continent. I won't hold it against you. But I won't be able to stand against what's coming for much longer, either."

I pressed my lips together, regarding the furious... wounded... terrified god. I knew that the conflict was bad, but... I did *not* want to become an arms dealer in a supernatural war.

As if reading my mind, Odin said, "You supply me with arms today, or you take them up yourself in a year. There is no in-between."

I closed my eyes. "I'm sorry, Odin," I said, "but I can't help you."

Odin's disappointment was palpable, and I could sense that they were turning to leave. But before they could, I held up a hand.
