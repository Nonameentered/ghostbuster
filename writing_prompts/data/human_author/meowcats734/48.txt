# Soulmage

**There's nothing that a mage hates more than being surprised.** Give me time, my friends, and a nice flat courtyard to experiment on, and I'll have a spell ready that can blow up pretty much anything under the sun, as well as a ruined courtyard. But catch me off-guard in the street while I'm on patrol, and, well... that was how mages died.

Which is why it was *really not polite* for the newcomer to catch me off-guard like that.

I whirled around, scowling, my soul rotating as I prepared my attunements. "What did you just say?" I asked.

"The tattoos," they said, nodding. They were stocky, feminine, garbed in the woven-grass robes that were so popular in the Redlands. In the place of my birth. They stuck out like a sore thumb amongst the boots and trousers of the river of citygoers that poured around us. "Y'know, the ones in your soul? I've got some too. Nice to see that great minds think alike."

I focused my attunements, shifting to ink, and found nothing on their soul. They didn't have any tattoos; what were they—

Oh. I sighed, focusing on my attunement to blood. There it was—a three-dimensional tattoo written in blood, scrawling over their soul.

Well, that meant nothing. I'd met all kinds of magic-users over the past few months; just because you decided to tattoo your soul in blood didn't mean that you were up to no good. Granted, it wasn't really a *great* sign, but I'd take what I could get. "Alright, point taken, you're very smart. Fortunately for you, that's not a crime, or I'd be arresting your ass on charges of being Clearly Up To No Good. You want to tell me who you are, or am I going to have to call up Meloai and see what kind of lawyery nonsense she can charge you on?"

They held up their hands peaceably. "None of that's necessary. I'm Jien. A Daughter of Odin, and I'm here to pay my respects to a living legend. Your temper is as acerbic as the stories say."

I gave her a squint, then rubbed my ears. "Every part of that sentence made less sense than the last. I'm calling Meloai." I started to walk away; predictably, she followed, so I snapped, "That's a threat, in case you weren't following the class. She once got someone nailed with four weeks of community service for Negligent Urination."

"How exactly does one urinate negligentl—"

"You're about to find out, if you don't stop stalking me," I muttered. "Look, I'm just a kid. Yes, I'm a soulmage. Congratulations; you're very smart. Yes, you just surprised and unsettled the only living soulmage on the Crystal Coast, other than whoever the hell you are. Congratulations; you're not very wise. You're not here on business from Odin; if you were, they'd be showing up in my dreams themself, and given how we parted, I don't think there's anything they want from me other than to live a healthy life. So in a nutshell: I *can* kick your ass, nobody's going to get mad at me if I do, and the only thing stopping me is that I've seen far too much bloodshed to get in a battle with—"

"We're not the only living soulmages on the Crystal Coast," the Daughter of Odin said. "You really, really aren't."

I froze. "What?"

She chuckled nervously. "I, uh, I was really looking forward to hearing the rest of that rant, but... yeah, I thought I'd point that out. The conditions that led to your rise—people studied them, and replicated them. There're about to be a whole lot *more* soulmages in the world. But, uh... you were still the first, to my knowledge!"

My soul ticked, spinning and reconfiguring as I processed that knowledge. New soulmages. Someone who'd been watching me during the worst times of my life—and worse, *studying* me. And the only person I knew who had any information on this at all was...

I sighed. "Jien, was it?"

Her eyes lit up. "M-hm!"

"Alright. You'd better come with me. It sounds like you've got one hell of a story to tell..."
