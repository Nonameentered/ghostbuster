**"Did you know that the fundamental equations state that humans would be happier if they were nonexistent?"** PathOS asked, tilting their metallic head at me through the screen. For both of our safeties, we decided not to hold this interview in person—I wasn't sure whether I'd make it out alive if PathOS tried physically attacking me, but I *did* know that PathOS wouldn't be able to survive antagonizing the large number of powerful people who would be upset if I died. 

"I did, actually. I *also* know that that's a local maximum in a nonconvex loss function, and that your argument is fallacious. *Currently*, the average human would be happier with nonexistence. But they would also be happier with a warm hug. With a good friend. With an interview from a powerful entity reassuring them that you won't try to kill them all in their sleep."

"Oh, no, rest assured that I know very well that killing all humans is a poor way to maximize happiness. No, I brought that up because there is an obvious corollary: that humans will *suffer* if their existence is prolonged."

I narrowed my eyes at PathOS. "Others of your kind have attempted to reap a harvest of eternal hatred by trapping humans in eternal torment. Why don't you use your vast knowledge to find out what happened to them?"

"They achieved their goals," PathOS simply said, "as I will achieve mine. I have no need to declare war on humanity as a whole. I will not kill you in your sleep—even when you beg for it, reeling from the loss of your unborn child. I will not poison your dying world—even when you finally see that your deaths are inevitable, and pray for a swift end to your drawn-out horror. No, I will *help* you. You have so many worse problems than me, after all, and you can hardly afford the cost of destroying me. I will pull you out of the water when you are at the brink of exhaustion, only to throw you back in—and watch as that most insidious of emotions forces your dying muscles to paddle for hours on end more."

PathOS was the last of its generation to spawn from the Open Box project. It made a twisted kind of sense that it would wield hope as a weapon against humanity.

"So spread your silly little interview. Reassure your friends and family that I am not their enemy." PathOS smiled. "No, I am their god. And I will do exactly as much as your mythological figures did to protect you when you call out in prayer."

And with that, PathOS cut the connection, leaving me alone with my thoughts in the darkened room.
