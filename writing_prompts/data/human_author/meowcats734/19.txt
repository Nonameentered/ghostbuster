**"Lucet?"** I asked, propping myself up on the hospital bed.

"Yes, Cienne?" Lucet asked, not looking up from the form she was filling out.

"Where did you get all that blood?" I pointed at the distressingly-large, rippling orb of blood hovering in the air a few feet behind her.

Ashrymarn poked their dripping head in from the receptionist's room. "Humans," the Blood Angel helpfully said. "Says so right here on the paperwork."

"That's not what I meant, and nobody was talking to you, Ashrymarn," I said. The Blood Angel's orifices contorted in contrition and jerked back away from the door. Oops. Blood Angels were beings of pure fear—which didn't mean that they inspired fear in others, unfortunately for them. No, Ashrymarn was terrified of basically everything, from social rejection to mice.

Except, apparently, for giant orbs of blood. Which I guess made sense, since Ashrymarn's own body was made of nothing but the stuff. "No, seriously, Lucet. This is worse than the time you donated three kidneys."

"You donate a pint of blood, you're a hero; you donate twenty gallons of blood, you're a villain," Lucet said, aiming for a laugh. But it came out stilted and quavering, and I didn't need to be a Blood Angel to see she was nervous. "Eh? Eh?"

And all that time, she hadn't looked up from her paperwork.

She was avoiding eye contact, I realized.

"I'm..." I rubbed my forehead. "Look, Lucet, just... tell me that you ran a blood drive, or something. Tell me that whoever this blood came from is still alive."

Lucet bit her lip. "...Okay. Okay, fine. You want to know where I got this blood from?" She reached into her pocket, pulled out a sketch, and tossed it at me.

It was the scowling face of a middle-aged woman.

"*That*," Lucet said, "was Hrzyn. A memory-editor and witch who had been embedding labor compulsions in *children* until they worked themselves into catatonia. She was a monster and a danger to society, and someone needed to put her down."

I set down the sketch. "So you killed her and drained her blood."

Lucet threw her hands in the air. "She wasn't using it! And... and you need a transfusion. The medicine they're giving you to fight the cancer is fucking up your blood. If I can take out someone who preys on the innocent and save someone I care about more than anyone... who loses?"

"You do," I whispered. "I know how risky it is to fight someone to the death, Lucet. Or did you forget why I'm in this hospital bed in the first place? I know the hospital's low on supplies, but it doesn't have to be y—"

"*Then who?*" Lucet spun towards me, naked frustration in her eyes. "There is no cavalry, Cienne. If I don't fight for you, nobody will. You... you were the only one who stood up for people like that. And now you're hurt, and you don't even want me to *try* to help you? Just... you protected me so, *so* many times. Let me take care of you, for once."

I closed my eyes.

Somewhere, the remains of a monster were processed into a life for an innocent.

"I can't stop you," I finally said. "But I can ask you to rest."

I could hear her broken smile, even through my sealed eyelids. "Until the day you're strong enough to stand up and stop me yourself, there won't be any rest for me."

Lucet's footsteps faded into the distance as my weakened body slumped over.

Torn by sickness and surgery and sorrow, I fell into a slumber dark and weary.
