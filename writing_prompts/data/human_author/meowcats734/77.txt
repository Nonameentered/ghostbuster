**The crow knew that others would be celebrating humanity's fall.** Already, his sharp eyes could see the coyotes feasting on the frozen corpses buried in the snow, the squirrels eagerly chewing their way into the once-impregnable stores of grain, the rabbits eagerly building their dens in the sturdy wooden barns that had nobody left to defend them. Sure, the eternal winter that the humans had left behind was inconvenient—but with access to the plenitude they left behind, they would surely make it through stronger than before.

...is what the crow would have thought if he was an idiot. But before the winter came and reduced the humans to nothing more than statues of flesh, the crow had been closer to humanity than most. He had never directly interacted with them, but his mate had been fed from the hands of the little girl who had once lived in the barn, and while watching over her, he had glimpsed the purpose behind the humans' machinations. The grain in the storehouses was not infinite: the humans brought it in from the fields, which were now buried in ice and snow. The barns were not eternal: they often broke and rotted, and the humans were constantly restoring them to normal. Even the water that flowed through the town was not natural: the crow had seen the humans reshape a nearby river with digging-tools and wooden pipes, and those, too, required maintenance.

Maintenance that no living soul in the empty blizzard still knew how to do.

The crow had no sense of time, especially now that the sun had been replaced with endlessly falling chunks of ice. But the part of the crow that had learned and grew as he watched the humans for his entire life knew that it would not be long before everything that the animals depended on—the grain, the water, the shelter—would be unmade, leaving nothing but silence and decay. Already, the crow could see that the fountain in the town square had stopped flowing, to the confusion and dismay of the various shivering animals who had come for their daily drink.

The crow tilted his head, considering. This... this was familiar, was it not? Yes... yes, the memory came slowly, then all at once. When the sun still shone and the humans still stood, the fountain had run dry before. And... and the humans had not just stood around *wishing* for the fountain to return.

The humans had gone to the pipes.

Despite the snowfall, the pipes were still clearly visible—they ran along rooftops, supported by sturdy, human-worked stone. The crow hopped along the rooftops, wary not to stray too far from the ground. He had already seen too many of his fellow flockmates struck down by a hailstone to try flying in this weather, and perhaps he would never fly again. Instead, he clutched tightly to the pipes, trying to remember what the humans had done next. They had carefully investigated the pipe, then used their clever little hands to take them apart and replace it with a freshly made section of wood. But... the crow had no way to do any of that.

Wait. No, wait, the crow couldn't fix the fountain, but he could do something just as good. When the humans had taken apart the pipe, it had burst forth with fresh water, much to the dismay of the humans who got splashed. But that would be good enough, would it not? The crow understood little of how the humans powered their works, but if the alternative was dying of thirst, he would gladly take the risk that breaking the pipe would damage the system beyond repair. Of course, the crow lacked the strength to break open the pipe himself... but that was of little issue.

This part, the crow knew how to handle.

"Caw," the crow said, picking up a chunk of ice. Taking the risk of a brief flap, he glided between rooftops... and dropped it onto a nearby coyote.

The coyote looked up, irritated, from their meal as the chunk of ice *thunked* on their back. "Yrrgh," the coyote snapped.

The crow tilted his head, bobbing his neck back and forth. "Caw?" He shot back, challenge in his eyes. With one claw, he hefted another piece of ice.

"Yrrgh-*ruff!*" The coyote growled, looking up from their frozen meal towards a warmer, much more *annoying* treat. Yes... yes, that was it. The crow hopped from side to side as the coyote sized their opponent up—

In a flurry of claws and wings, the coyote pounced, and the crow backed up, letting the coyote *slam* into the pipe. Although the wooden pipes were sturdy, the coyote's body was heavy, and the pipe *burst* open, ice sluicing out before cold, fresh water poured all over the coyote. Yelping in shock, they backed away as the crow tilted his head. The pipe... the pipe had been blocked by ice. How odd. Where had the ice entered the pipe from? The river? But the ice was so perfectly fitted to the inside of the tube—how had it even fit?

A rustle of paws and claws shook the crow free from his musings, and he looked down to see the eager animals lapping away at the new source of water.

The relics the humans left behind had been the only thing keeping them alive, and those relics were decaying fast. But if the crow had anything to say about it, they would use what was left to them to their fullest.

The crow dipped his beak into the fresh-flowing water, and it tasted of victory and knowledge.
