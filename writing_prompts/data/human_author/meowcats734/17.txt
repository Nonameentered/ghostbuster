**I opened my eyes, and overlapping visions of every possible future flooded the empty house.** The windows that were barren now would sprout flowerpots, curtains, or woodwork. That empty, wrecked hallway would be lined with soft mats and toy balls. The upstairs bedroom would hold one crib, or two, or three.

And this house would fill with children. Adopted, of course—but they would be our children nonetheless. I saw a giggling toddler chase after a shrieking child, a snake in one chubby fist, while my husband looked at the two of them, exasperated. And simultaneously, I saw a drooling, zonked-out teenager sleeping off what must have been a hell of a hangover, my husband giving them a knowing look as he worked on his woodcraft. And our future sons and daughters ran and played and laughed and lived everywhere as far as I could see, rippling in my futuresight like the sky caught in a puddle.

I reached out my hand, instinctively, to touch one of the visions, but my flesh passed through the possibility like a stone through a pond.

"What do you see?" Jiaola asked from my side. I turned to look at my husband—the Jiaola of now, not the hundreds of him I saw in the endlessly branching futures—and he must have seen the bittersweet melancholy on my face, because he took my hand in his.

"If we choose to stay here," I said, "there are children. Maybe one. Maybe many. But always children."

Jiaola gave me a teasing smile, poking me in the ribs. "I wonder whose idea that was?"

"Well." I felt at my body, wondering when it would betray me. When the first odd swelling would begin. "It must have been yours, because..." I trailed off, gaze caught by one particular possibility. A future where the sun had set, and Jiaola had returned to the windowsill that he had lovingly cared for over the years.

The windowsill that overlooked a simple grave.

"Because, my love?" Jiaola prompted.

"Because I'm not there," I whispered. "In all the futures I see, I'm not there."

Jiaola shook his head. "Don't let it get to you, Sansen. You told me yourself—your futuresight only shows you elemental possibilities."

"Which is why I know that, when something is absent, it has left the realm of possibility entirely." I held up my hand, and in my futuresight I saw straight through it, as if I was already nothing more than a ghost. "I've checked the future, Sansen. The cancer catches up to me eventually. Slower, in some timelines, than others. But always, *always* inevitable."

Jiaola squeezed my hand, and I wasn't sure if he was reassuring himself or me. "We'll find a way," he whispered. "Those futures you see? I want you to live through them with me."

"I do, too," I murmured. "More than anything."

But the futures cared little for what one oracle desired.

And no matter how long I watched the children and their father play, I never joined them.
