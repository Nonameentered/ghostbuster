**Alexandria burned eternal, in every future and every past.** Like the lighthouse it once stood next to, the destruction of its worldline shone bright along the shores of possibility. It was a warning, but also a beacon.

*Here, once, never, and always, stood knowledge beyond what any world should ever know. Swim against the flow of time, and find yourself facing the same fate. Here stood truths that could turn the tide of wars, and knowledge that would unmake empires. You are not worthy. Turn back.*

And it was true. Only the mad, the truly desperate, or the incredibly stupid would risk diving into Alexandria's eternal flames.

Thankfully, I was all three of those, so I had no problem striding towards Alexandria.

"Rifts, Cienne, you can't just *walk into* Alexandria Burning," Sansen groused, grabbing my arm. Even though the grumpy old oracle had been the one to take us to the Plane of Elemental Possibility, he still didn't seem too happy about the plan to raid Alexandria. "That's not normal fire. Get that stuff on you, and you'll not only burn *now*, you'll always *have* been burning, and always will be."

I didn't have a great sense of self-preservation, but getting condemned to a massively overkill attack on my entire timeline seemed like a bit much for me. Besides, that sounded like it'd get my past self hurt, and he was a dumb little kid who'd done nothing wrong other than eventually grow up into the self-loathing asshole I was today. So I gave Alexandria Burning a healthy distance as I stepped away from it. Not too far, thoughâ€”outside the light the timefire cast, the Plane of Elemental Possibility dissolved into a chaotic mess of every future that still could be. I had no idea how Sansen typically made sense of it all.

"So... how are we supposed to get anything useful out of it, then, if it's not only all burnt, it's *always* been burnt?" Meloai, always the voice of reason, asked by my side.

"I don't *know*," Sansen groused. "Futuresight doesn't work from inside the Plane of Elemental Possibility, and *I'm* not the one who suggested we come here. I only brought up Alexandria Burning as a damn joke. Cienne's the one who was so desperate for an advantage over the Order of Valhalla that he made me take you idiots here. Rifts, what am I doing here?" To my surprise, the normally unflappable oracle started pacing, muttering to himself.

"What the heck *is* this timefire stuff, anyway?" Lucet asked from my side. "I mean... I've studied a lot of magics, and I know some witches can pull off time travel, even if it's horribly ill-advised, but... I've never heard of anything like this before."

"Yeah, well, you won't hear about it for another couple centuries, at the very least," Sansen said. "From what I've gathered, this stuff is from some far-future civilization. The kind of enforcement agency that uses the destruction of an entire worldline as a cheap 'no tresspassing' sign. I *cannot* stress enough how bad of an idea it would be to extract information that these guys want destroyed, if it was even possible."

"No, no, that's okay," I said, stepping forward and preparing the tool I'd had Meloai make for me. A simple metal censer, with a bundle of wood in the center. "I was never after the *knowledge* inside Alexandria Burning. You made it pretty clear that us primitive little apes aren't anywhere close to tangling with the godlike monsters who made this place. But what is a human, if not one who steals fire from the gods?"

Sansen stared at me in horror, and... a little bit of grudging awe. "You... you *madman*."

"That was one of the requirements to try to raid this place, wasn't it? I was never after the library, Sansen." I touched the censer to the timefire, and suddenly, the censer was burning, was always burning, would always burn.

"I was after the fires that destroyed it."

And with that, I turned around, carefully holding the flames of the gods at arms' length, with a timeline's worth of pain for anyone who stood in my way.
