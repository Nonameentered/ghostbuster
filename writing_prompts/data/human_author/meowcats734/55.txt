Aww, I'm glad! I'll admit, I've been worried as of lateâ€”I've been spinning my wheels more than I normally do with bringing Book II to a close, and there've probably been more non-canon chapters written than canon ones for Book II at this point. But the recent chapters, I'm very confident in my ability to integrate into main canon.
