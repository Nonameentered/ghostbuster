**It was one of those jobs that was 'beneath' everyone, so nobody got it done.** Like cleaning out the kitchen of mildly aggressive slime molds, or sweeping the sewer of mutated gremsquirrels. There was no glory or cash to be found in those jobs, after all, and even a seasoned witch like me had to pay the bills.

But ignoring the slime molds and the gremsquirrels was how you got a bloated city without a functioning sewer system. So after four months passed and nobody had even *tried* to reach out a hand to poor Jaishek and his cat, I decided to take up the posted job bulletin.

"Thank you kindly, young man," Jaishek said, wringing his hands. "I don't have much in the way of gold, but I've got two sacks of beans with your name on them."

I waved a hand. "Wait until the job's done, man. Who knows—I might not be able to do anything about Mimi."

"Oh, but you're the sweetest little boy for even trying." Aww. Despite having tussled with demons and eldritch abominations, I supposed I *was* still quite young, as cityfolk counted it. "Can't I at least treat you to some tea?"

I reached into my soul and sliced a rift between planes, catching a glimpse of my future. As sweet as Jaishek was, his idea of 'tea' seemed to be steeping grains in water and sipping from the resulting mush; after seeing my poor future self try to choke down the concoction, I politely excused myself to go on the hunt.

I was a witch, and emotions were the source of my craft. So as I stepped into the same amber waves of grain that had surrounded me during my childhood, it was easy to let nostalgia well up into my soul, sowing it out across the field so that I could peer into the distant past. I still hadn't mastered some of the trickier techniques that would let me conserve power, but I didn't think I'd need to—there was plenty of nostalgia to be found in these endless grassy plains.

After all, if I closed my eyes, I could almost pretend my hometown still existed.

The spell of nostalgia clicked into place, a shimmering vision of the past materializing, and I started counting under my breath as the sun and moon arced across the sky. Once I reached a hundred and twenty-two—how many days ago Mimi had gone missing—I slowed the flow of nostalgia from my soul, letting the vision of the past proceed in real time. Mimi had been sunning herself in the yard when—

I winced. Ah. A freewing had swooped down and snatched the poor cat up. The massive raptors had claws practically as large as the cat's bodies. Poor Mimi was no longer living with us in this world.

Which just made things... harder.

I waved a hand, dismissing the spell that let me see into the past, and sighed. Great. I had hoped for a nice, relaxing fetch job so I could chow down on some beans. Now... now, it seemed, the parameters of my quest were a little different. An ordinary person would have no chance of finding a cat that was already dead and long digested.

I, on the other hand, was a necromancer. And I was *intimately* familiar with the art of tracking down souls in the various planes they went to after death.

"This farmer's beans had better be worth it," I grumbled to myself.

Then, grabbing a sheet of insecurity from my soul, I cut open a rift between this world and the next, and stepped through.
