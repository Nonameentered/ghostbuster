# Endless Worlds Most Beautiful

**"Unidentified civilian vessel, this is USS Midway,"** Captain Haldt drawled at the hologram. "Please state the nature of your emergency, and help will be on the way."

The only response Haldt got was the gentle rotation of the hologram, displaying the vessel in real time. It was a small, flat teardrop, about thirty meters in length. Standard, for lower-end civilian transport.

Shareholder Quinn tapped the hologram, flicking their slender fingers twice before adding in a small speck near the front end of the vehicle. Haldt gave them a curious glance. "Notice something, shareholder?"

"Yeah, I don't have a head for the size of this thing. I added in a banana for scale," they said. "Look, Captain, are you sure we risk helping some random unmarked civilian? The drive signature's going haywire; I don't want to be anywhere near that ball of radiation if it blows."

Haldt rolled her eyes. "You want to talk scale? Ever wonder why this ship's called the Midway?"

Quinn raised an eyebrow. "Because it's somewhere midway between corporate disaster and military nightmare?"

Haldt chuckled. "Not far off. Midway got her name from an old ship back on Earth. Biggest of her kind. You want a banana for scale?" Haldt zoomed out the scale on the hologram, until the teardrop ship was nothing more than a blip next to one of the titanic engines of the USS Midway. "If we wanted, we could sneeze on the damn ship and it'd become nothing but disincorporated plasma. There's no danger to be had by investigating a spare civilian. Besides, we're here to protect the people of Sol; I'd much rather be running rescue missions than combat operations."

Quinn grumbled. "I still don't like it."

"Then I'll tell you what," Haldt said. "I'm sending two of the boarding crews to check out what's what, since our friends don't seem inclined to respond. Why don't you join the away team? Keep an eye on them, if you think they're wasting your time."

Quinn rubbed their chin. "Alright, fair. Give me five to get shelled up. Kiss for luck?"

Haldt grinned. "Business before pleasure, soldier. But I'll see you when you get back."

Quinn winked at Haldt, then stood, stretching in the gentle thrust of half-gravity. After a moment to adjust after sitting for so long, they loped along the halls towards the hangar bays. The ambient algorithms had already figured out their destination; elevators were called ahead of time, arrows on the wall helpfully provided directions, and Quinn's shell was ready and waiting for them by the time they reached the hangars. Blurring the line between spaceship and spacesuit, the shell was a thick, bullet-shaped casing of metal, equipped with robotic appendages and top-of-the-line fall thrusters. Quinn had hardly any training when it came to boarding other ships, but the unparalleled protection of the shell meant they didn't need it.

Their boarding companions, on the other hand, were not so lucky. Equipped only with minimalistic spacesuits, they eyed their new supervisor with irritation.

"Keep the suit out of my way," the mission leader muttered under his breath. "Alright, everyone, we've got orders from the Captain. Suspicious civilian liner is suspicious, and we're getting bizarre readings from their drive, so be ready to evac if it looks like things are about to blow. We're doing things smart—once we're docked to make sure we don't depressurize any civilians still living inside, we'll have a drone cut its way on board. Get to your stations."

It was a scant few minutes before the two ships approached—one to dock, one to stay back and run support if hostiles were on board. It was vanishingly unlikely that anything could take the lot of them on, of course, but the precautions were in place for a reason.

With a thud, the two ships connected, the airlock making a perfect seal against the metal of the ship. A holographic feed of the cutting drone began to play.

Quinn leaned forwards, ordering the shell to reach out, and tapped the hologram. The mission leader gave her a frown. "What are you—"

"Banana for scale," they said, sticking out their tongue as they edited in a holographic banana.

The mission leader scowled, starting to speak, then frowned, turning towards the camera feed. "Hey. Hey, what the fuck is that?"

As if they'd poked an anthill with a stick, from within the interior of the ship, a swarm of inky blackness poured forth. The poor drone lasted seconds against the onslaught before dissolving in a swarm of sparks. The soldiers gripped their weapons while the mission leader reached for the comms.

"Unknown hostiles on board! Slag the ship, slag the—" The commander's voice abruptly cut off as they slapped the manual distress button.

And found that it, too, had splashed into a swarm of black specks.

The mission leader didn't even have time to scream as Quinn finally made sense of what they were seeing. The nanites raced up the mission leader's spacesuit, stalled only momentarily by the plastic, and reached the leader before he could even grab his gun.

The empty spacesuit splashed onto the floor, melting moments later as the nanites assimilated them.

In the distance, the second ship must have noticed something was wrong—Quinn had no idea how smart the nanites were, but it wasn't intelligent enough to disable their comms systems beforehand. The holographic feed wasn't focused on their ally, but Quinn still felt it as tremors ran through the ship, distant railgun fire shaking the conjoined, nanite-ridden bodies—

And then a direct hit from a railgun blasted the ship apart.

One moment, they were people fighting an unstoppable swarm; the next, they were component molecules drifting in the vacuum of space. Quinn distantly recognized the flashes of railgun fire streaking through the disguised civilian ship, cutting through the nanite cloud like a knife through water and doing about as much lasting damage. The nanite swarm fired a single shot back.

Within seconds, the ship was already being eaten from the inside out, melting into formless dark.

Frantically, Quinn ordered a connection to the USS Midway. Captain Haldt gave them a tight, grieving look.

"Haldt," Quinn stammered, "I'm sorry, I couldn't—I didn't know—"

"It's okay, Quinn. It's okay. It's going to be okay. Fire the magnetar!" The Captain directed that last comment at someone offscreen; moments later, the space the nanite swarm had occupied blurred as incomprehensibly vast forces tore the nanites apart. It seemed as if that strained even the regenerative capabilities of the swarm, because it split into a thousand smaller entities, each homing in unerringly on the massive ship. 

"It's... yeah. It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay," Quinn repeated to themself. In the distance, more magnetar fire ripped the nanite clouds apart. The Midway would survive. The Midway would survive, and Quinn would get to come home and...

And Quinn knew that she was lying to herself.

Because already, she could see the streaks of darkness eating away at the shell that stood between her and the void of space.

"I'm so, so sorry," Captain Haldt whispered, and Quinn knew that she had come to the same realization long before her. Someone hesitantly asked Haldt a question, but she just shook her head. "I... I want you to know that I love you. And that I'm here for you. Whatever you want, any request you have—I'll fulfill it to the best of my ability."

Quinn choked out a half-laugh, half sob. The darkness had nearly reached her arms. Somewhere, flares of energy marked where the nanites encountered the active defense systems around the USS Midway. "Can you—can you give me a kiss for good luck?"

Captain Haldt's expression crumpled.

As if they were holding the weight of a star on her shoulders, she shakily managed a smile.  
"Business before pleasure, soldier. I'll see you on the other side."

Haldt blew Quinn a kiss, right before the holographic feed was consumed by the nanites.

And Quinn fell into shadow and dust, weeping with a smile on her face.
