# Bargain Bin Superheroes

(Arc 0, Part ?: Clara Olsen v.s. Public Opinion)

**Tupperman leapt out of Dani's Second-Hand Jewelry, skidding on the street, and sprinted towards his beat-up old getaway car.** I sighed. Poor kid couldn't even afford a proper getaway driver. I didn't even particularly *want* to arrest him.

But he had chosen to play the role of the supervillain, and I had chosen to play the role of the heroine. So I had to stop him.

"Are you one of those *new* heroes?" a woman asked, filming the robbery with her smartphone. Oh, great. My senses of super-empathy told me that there was a ninety percent chance her name was Karen.

"I was registered two years back, ma'am," I said.

"Are you going to *stop* that vile criminal?" she asked. "Come on, shoot him with laser beams or hurricane breath or something."

"Okay, first of all, that's use of excessive force *and* negligent property damage, to say nothing of risk fo bystanders. Second, he's a college dropout whose superpower is to summon *Tupperware*. I'm not unleashing the big guns on a kid like him. And finally..." I sighed. "I don't have laser eyes or hurricane breath. I don't have any combat-related powers at all."

The woman scoffed at me. "See? *New* heroes. So what *is* your power, anyway?"

"Gun," I deadpanned. That wasn't my power, of course—you did have to have *a* power to call yourself a superhero—but I didn't feel like spilling my every secret to some random woman on the street. Judging by the squeal of burning rubber and the absence of motion from the getaway car, Tupperman seemed to have discovered that I'd booted his wheel while he was busy robbing the store. He was currently trying to get back out, which probably would have worked if I didn't walk up to the door and casually lean on it, sealing him inside his own car. He turned towards the other door, but I just raised an eyebrow.

"Is running away with a couple hundred dollars worth of jewelry *really* worth losing an entire car? Or do you want to cooperate and not get your vehicle impounded?"

"Oi!" The woman with the phone heckled. "Don't *talk* to the damn supervillain! Beat him up a little! I'm losing audience retention as we speak!"

Ugh. I opened my mouth to say something about how beating the shit out of some defenseless kid who suffered more in a day than she did in her entire life was the *opposite* of being a hero, but Tupperman beat me to it.

"Listen here, you ungrateful little brat." Tupperman pointed, and a harmless plastic box materialized upside-down on her head. The woman shrieked with rage, flailing to take the offending object off, and in the commotion, Tupperman managed to separate her phone from her hand with another expertly-placed Tupperware box. It clattered to the floor with a *thunk*. "Clara Olsen may not be flashy. She might not destroy cities or overthrow governments. But you know what? She gets the fucking job done, and she never hurts people who don't deserve it. That's what a *real* hero does, super or otherwise." Tupperman gave the woman a disgusted look, then turned to me. "Look, I need my car to drive Roger to school. Tell you what, I'll go with you quietly just to see that woman's indignant spluttering—just let me get my vehicle back."

I gave a pointed look at the sack of second-hand jewelry he'd stolen, and he chuckled awkwardly. "Right. Er. That. Here." He handed it over.

"You're still under arrest," I said. "And seriously, get a real job. Do I have to land you an interview or something?"

"Ach. Just tell me when to show up at court already." He hesitated, then—in a lower voice—said, "I really appreciate... you not being harder on me. On any of us low-level supervillains."

I waved a hand. "It's who I am. Now come on, get into the backseat." I unlocked the boot and hopped in the driver's seat of his car.

He gave me an incredulous look. "You don't even have your own vehicle?"

I glared at him. "You see how the people of this city treat me? I'm lucky I can afford a fucking bike, Connor."

He laughed. "Dude. I'm pretty sure *I* make more money than you. I'm surprised you haven't gone villain yet."

I shook my head. "I'm a hero, Connor. Even if I'm a shitty, bargain bin superhero, they can't take that from me."

"Damn right they can't," Tupperman agreed.

And I drove a criminal, a villain, and a friend away from a city that hated us both.

Been a month since the last BBSH. Hopefully it reads well. Apologies for any typos or inconsistencies—I'm sick, and also only typing with nine fingers.
