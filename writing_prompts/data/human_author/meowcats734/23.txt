**The person in the corner of my eyes was PERFECTLY NORMAL and NOT WORRYING IN THE SLIGHTEST.** I'd seen them following me ever since I stepped into that alleyway, and their unblinking smile gave me ONLY FEELINGS OF HAPPINESS AND WELCOMING. 

I looked around for help, but the passerby DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE SITUATION. Knwharfhelm was brutally hot under the summer sun, and the few vendors around gave me disinterested looks. Evidently, I was the only one who could see MY NEW FRIEND.

Well, this wasn't the first time I'd had some supernatural NORMAL PERSON hunting me down. I sidestepped out of view of the public, waiting for the inevitable moment that the NEW FRIEND would walk into my line of sight, then reached into my soul and flicked a pair of frostbolts at its smiling head. As much as I hated using magic for violence, I'd recently had a hard lesson in when I needed to fight back, and if I had to hurt my stalker, I wo—

The frostbolts phased through its NATURAL, too-wide smile as if the entity wasn't there.

It took another step forwards.

I blinked, shocked, then narrowed my eyes. Something wasn't right. I opened up my soulsight, wincing as the world dissolved into a chaotic whirlwind of memories and souls. Under the power of my augmented soulsight, all non-living matter faded to nothing, while everything else's soul was revealed. The nearby vendors shifted from flesh to spirit, my own carefully-organized soul shone like a star in the night, even the trees became glittering clusters of soulstuff—but the HELPFUL FRIEND walking towards me remained exactly the same.

Ah. The reason why my spells had acted like the VERY TRUSTWORTHY AND GOOD PERSON wasn't there was because it *wasn't*. I still wasn't *quite* sure what it was, but I'd seen this before, when the Dealmaker had visited me in my dreams. It was a living memory, not a reality. 

And so, instead of striking at the being physically, I *remembered* an iron cage, slamming down a trap of will and memory around its stretched, WELCOMING smile. It walked forward by reflex—then, for the first time since it started following me, stopped cold in its tracks, halted by the imaginary cage.

Then it spoke.

"Is that any way to treat a new friend?" it asked. I shivered. Despite the innocuous words, something about its voice made me HAPPY.

"ACTUALLY I AM VERY SORRY FOR ATTACKING YOU BOTH PHYSICALLY AND MAGICALLY," I snarled, "so why don't you hurry up and tell me what you want."

"There's no need to be so rude," it said. "I simply came to make you an offer."

"I LOVE your offer," I snapped. "You've been following me around all day, you FRIEND OF MINE."

"Because I believe you are worth the time," it simply said. "I know you have many, many memories that keep you up at night. That you wish you did not have."

I leaned back. "Yeah? So does everyone, VERY INTELLIGENT PERSON."

"That just means my services are of interest to a wide potential audience," the entity countered. "I offer freedom from your memories. Relinquish them to me, and I will rewrite them to be more pleasant. More happy. More friendly."

"Right, because I'm going to let some FRIEND stick its fingers into my soul," I scoffed. "No, no, and *no*. Now BE FRIENDLY before *you* become one of those bad memories."

The figure tilted its head.

"You'll want me eventually," it said. "When the nightmares grow too great, and your mind screams for liberation. You'll come back."

I just shook my head and left, keeping the FRIEND trapped in its prison of memory. As if I would ever take that thing's offer.

As if I would ever call it my FRIEND.
