**"We've got a John Doe here,"** Vuliel said.

I scratched my head. "What, like you don't know his name?"

"Hm? No, as in his name is John Doe." Vuliel frowned at me. "Why, is that unusual?"

"No, no, it's... it's very usual."

"You could almost say... too usual," Meloai piped up from behind me. I rolled my eyes, but she had a point. I was a witch, she was a shapeshifter, Vuliel was possessed by a ghost, and we were all taking shelter in an abandoned cafe from the aftermath of a military-grade portal spell that was throwing hail from another dimension at us and everything within a thousand feet. Objectively speaking, everything about our situation was bizarre, unique, and magical.

Except for John Doe.

"When I asked for leads on where the army that cast the portal spell was," I said, "I was hoping you'd have something a little more concrete than 'a perfectly ordinary guy.'"

Vuliel shook his head. "Cienne, you don't get it. He's a *perfectly* ordinary guy. Magic flat-out doesn't work around him. I can't get within three feet of the guy, because I'm terrified it'll kill Mertri." Vuliel tapped his head as he spoke—Mertri was the ghost of his husband who'd possessed him to stay alive. Man, we were a bizarre bunch.

"Why three feet?" I asked.

"No idea. Although it's... actually more like three feet, three inches, if that matters."

"How'd you meet John?" Meloai asked.

"He was just... sitting in the cafe when we arrived. He doesn't come out much, but... we share our supplies with him." Vuliel shuddered. "Nobody wants to piss off the guy who can turn off magic simply by existing."

"Oh, wonderful! Cienne's *great* at not pissing people off!" Meloai's optimistic little voice piped up from behind me. I flipped her the bird in response.

"Well, I'm the only free person who won't die if magic gets turned off, so I guess I'm the only person for the job." I cracked my knuckles and stepped towards the wooden door. "I've dealt with worse. Bring it on, John."

I opened the door to reveal a frowning, balding man chewing on a bowl of oatmeal.

"It's polite to knock," John Doe said. "But given that... wherever I am... doesn't seem to follow the laws of physics as I know them, I suppose I can forgive my fellow man a couple cultural misunderstandings."

"The laws of what?" I asked, frowning. "No, wait, never mind, take a step back. You said you don't know where you are?"

He shrugged. "If I had to venture a guess, I'd say the inside of a nice warm cabin in the middle of a blizzard. That's much better than my previous location of falling from the sky after some kind of portal popped into existence and vomited me out into this hellscape." He hesitated, glancing at each of our faces, then said, "Er, no offense."

"None taken," I said, the tinglings of an idea forming in the back of my mind. "You... you said that you *fell* here? When a portal opened up?"

John Doe grimaced, covering his embarassment with another bite of oatmeal. "I know, I know, it's stupid. The world doesn't work like that. But—"

"No, it's not stupid. It lines up with what we know—the Order of Valhalla cast their mass portal spell... what, six days back? That was when the big battle ended, anyway. Does that line up with when you got taken here?"

John Doe fell silent.

"Spell," he finally said. "Like... magic."

I shared a concern glance with Meloai, then turned back to him and nodded. "What, were you thinking of a dictionary? Yes, spell as in magic."

"Forgive me for not being familiar with the physics of an *entirely different dimension*," John Doe muttered. "Six days ago... even if 'magic did it' is a bit of a hard explanation to believe, the timeline matches."

He fell silent, mulling something over.

Then he said, "This... Order that you mentioned. They took me from my world with... their 'magic'? In order to get an advantage in war?"

I nodded hesitantly.

John Doe stood up, drawing something from his hip with a grim stare. Something compact and metallic, with a hole in one end that made me feel like I was staring at death itself. "Where I'm from, that's called *human trafficking*, and we have *ways* of dealing with people like them." He narrowed his eyes. "I don't know much about this magic stuff, but I'll tell you everything I know about how I came here, on one condition."

I hesitated. "And that would be?"

"When you find the assholes that kidnapped me?" John Doe slotted something into the metal contraption, and something made a menacing *click*. "Let me show them what I think of their 'magic'."
