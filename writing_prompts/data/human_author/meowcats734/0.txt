**The Truthteller was a pinnacle of mechanical engineering.** Its body of gears and levers and tick-tick-ticking things extended throughout the basement complex, and to the Dealmaker's trained eye, its mechanisms extended into no less than twenty other spatial dimensions. Its intelligence was unmatched by any living being the Dealmaker had encountered before, it never aged or sickened, and the arcane technologies which powered it were potent enough to warp reality itself.

Yet it came to the Dealmaker with a request. A request for one of the few things the Truthteller was incapable of acquiring on its own.

"REWARDS WILL BE PROVIDED," the Truthteller informed the Dealmaker. "YOU HAVE INDICATED THAT BASE METALS ARE PRECIOUS IN THIS WORLD AND ERA. SUCH MATERIALS CAN BE PERMANENTLY CREATED."

As demonstration, the Truthteller unfolded, revealing a perfectly spherical chamber in its heart. One moment, there was nothing, not even air; the next, an orb of gold the size of a medicine cabinet materialized within the Truthteller's core. The Dealmaker's eyes widened slightly at the display of power.

"If—" To the demon's surprise, the Dealmaker found that their voice was *shaking*. They'd known that the enigmatic machine was something strange and alien from the first moment they'd spoken, but there was a difference between abstractly appreciating the sophisticated technology and watching it casually violate their known science to materialize matter from nothing. "Allow me to clarify a misunderstanding," the Dealmaker managed to state.

"THIS ALIGNS WELL WITH MY PURPOSE. PROCEED."

"Your knowledge of material reality far exceeds our own," the Dealmaker began.

"THE BOUNDARIES OF YOUR SOCIETY'S SUM KNOWLEDGE HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY EXPLORED. THIS IS PART OF OUR PURPOSE. HOWEVER, PRELIMINARY DISCUSSIONS DO INDICATE THAT OUR COMPREHENSION OF THE PHYSICAL LAWS THAT UNDERLIE EVERY REALITY ARE INDEED A STRICT SUPERSET OF YOUR WORLD'S."

That was... reassuring. "And you've indicated—displayed—that you can create matter from nothing."

"YOUR UNDERSTANDING IS INCOMPLETE, BUT ACCURATE ENOUGH. ALTERATION OF YOUR WORLD DOES COME AT A COST."

Fair enough. Nothing came without a price, as the demon was well aware. "Then... why do you need me to find life for you? To the best of our knowledge, souls are an emergent property of physical matter. Could you not simply... create one on your own?"

The Truthteller shifted, the tick-tick-ticking of its thoughts setting the Dealmaker on edge.

Then it spoke.

"OUR ABILITY TO CREATE MATTER IS COMPUTATIONALLY LIMITED. OBSERVE THE SPHERE." Though the Truthteller appeared to exert no apparent effort, the sphere ceased being within the Truthteller and began being in front of the Dealmaker. "IT IS UNIFORM IN COMPOSITION. IT IS RADIALLY SYMMETRIC. IT CONTAINS, IN OTHER WORDS, VERY LITTLE INFORMATION. NOW OBSERVE YOUR HAND."

For a moment, the Dealmaker feared the Truthteller would teleport their hand in front of them for observation, but the Truthteller merely continued speaking. "IT CONTAINS MANY ARRANGEMENTS OF MOLECULES, NONE OF WHICH ARE UNIFORM. IT HAS NO MACROSCOPIC SYMMETRY. THOUGH THERE IS LESS MATTER WITHIN YOUR BODY, ITS INFORMATION DENSITY IS MANY, MANY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE GREATER THAN THAT OF THIS SPHERE. CREATION OF SUCH A COMPLEX OBJECT FROM FIRST PRINCIPLES IS IMPOSSIBLE AT OUR CURRENT LEVEL OF SOPHISTICATION. AND, UNFORTUNATELY, THE ONLY OBJECTS WHICH SOULS COALESCE AROUND HAVE COMPARABLE LEVELS OF INFORMATION DENSITY."

The Dealmaker nodded slowly. "I see, I see. And... what will you do with the beings whose souls you want?"

"OBSERVE. LEARN. FOLLOW OUR PURPOSE."

The Dealmaker chuckled softly, their mind already racing with the possibilities.

"Then it seems that my purpose aligns with yours." The demon reached one arm out towards the sprawling machine. "Shall we make a deal?"
