**The Demon of Fear coiled her sinuous black form around my humble wooden desk.** It was no throne of skulls or chair of living agony, but the last Demon Lord had both of those, and I'd deposed him easily enough.

"Demon Lord," the Demon of Fear hissed, "your forces await your orders."

"I am aware, Margaret." The Demon of Fear twitched with surprise—was it that uncommon to remember a name? "Could you pass me the report on the Second Battle of Hatebroke?"

The Demon of Fear hesitated. On one hand, she was a being of primordial darkness and terror, who bowed to no liege and consumed the souls of her victims after unmaking their bodies into dust.

On the other hand, I wasn't asking a Demon of Fear. I was asking Margaret, the self-conscious, insecure woman who put on a show of might because she was perpetually worried she'd be preyed on by the older Demons of Hatred if she didn't. The Demon of Fear had to put on a show for the world.

Margaret, my friend, did not.

"Yes, my lord," Margaret hissed.

"Just call me Odin," I said. Margaret flitted between extradimensional spaces beyond mortal comprehension, where I liked to keep my files for organizational purposes, and withdrew the report of the Second Battle of Hatebroke. The fittingly-named town had been a small but prosperous farming village, protected from roving bandits by the coalition of demons and bandits whom I called friends.

That is, until the Silent Peaks decided that a community of demons living peacefully like the people they were was absolutely unacceptable, and launched the Silent Crusade to eradicate us all.

A lot had happened between then and now. We'd lost Hatebreak. Retaken it. And now we'd lost it again, razed to the ground by the battlechoirs of the Silent Academy. But by now I'd had enough.

I pushed back the simple wooden chair of my office. I had an office, not a throne room. Throne rooms were for tyrants and overlords.

I was an equal. I would be first among the forces that rose to defend all of demonkind, and I would be the last.

"Margaret," I said. "Would you do me a favor?"

"Of course, my l—of course, Odin."

"I need you to fetch someone," I said.

"Who?" Margaret asked. "The Demons of Spite? Or the Demons of Shame?"

I shook my head. "Margaret.  This war will not be won with fury and blind hate. The Silent Crusade has brought enough of that with them already." I stood, holding out one hand, and the magical threads that formed the basis of my power coalesced at my fingertips. "This war will be won with kindness."

"So... who do you want me to fetch?" Margaret asked, confused.

I smiled. "Anyone who wishes to defect from the Silent Crusade," I said, wrapping my magic around my soul. And with it, I packaged the memory of this conversation—the feel of talking to Margaret as a person, not a demon, the curiosity and empathy and *goodness* I saw in her. "Because after today, I have a feeling there will be quite a few of them. Anyone who wishes to defect, simply evacuate your camp, and my allies will protect you from any reprisal your so-called leaders would bring down on you."

Margaret tilted her head, uncomprehending. "But... Odin... they are your *enemies*. Why are you offering them aid?"

"Because I am a Demon of Empathy," I simply said, "and this is how I win wars."

Then I snapped my fingers, and the message I'd composed flew out to every soul on the opposite side of the battlefield.

I'd treated demons with compassion and open arms.

I'd do the same for anyone, even the crusaders who threatened to end everything I had worked for.
