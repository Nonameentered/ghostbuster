(Arc 0, Part ?: Tupperman v.s. The LGBTQ Community)

**"Even my nemesis thinks I'm gay,"** Tupperman groused. "I guess it's always been that way."

"Maybe it's 'cause of the way that you walk?" I tried, poking him in the ribs. He gave me a confused look.

"What? Clara, I walk on floating pieces of Tupperware. I'm aware of plenty of stereotypes about gay people, but as far as I know, that's not one of them."

I rubbed my forehead. "No, it was a reference to—you know what, never mind. Look, Tupperman, you're good with kids. Young heroes have an excuse to approach you. And you're not likely to rat out questioning kids to their parents. Honestly, I can't believe I have to spell this out to you. You're... everyone's big brother."

Tupperman scowled, materializing an empty Tupperware box with one hand and chucking at me. I caught it as he started to rant. "No. No, no, *nope*. My *real* younger brother is someone I love and protect with all of my heart, and I've stood up to governments and abusers alike for him. I am *not* taking on that responsibility for every darn kid hero who wants to come my way, no matter how gay they are."

"You don't have to," I said, bonking him on the head with his own summoned Tupperware. He dematerialized it with a flick of his hands. "They may be kids, but they're also heroes in their own right. They'll figure themselves out. Just... lend them a friendly ear every now and then."

"Well, I'm a captive audience," Tupperman drawled, holding up his cuffed wrists. "By all means, have my ears."

"Not *me*. I worked out my troubles long before we met." With a mischeivous grin, I stepped aside. "No, I'd like to introduce you to my newest sidekick, Rooftop Star."

I stepped aside, revealing a scrawny, awkward-limbed teen who shuffled up to Tupperman, who was giving me a glare that promised many thrown plastic boxes when we next clashed in the streets. 

"Uh... hi. Is it true that you're the first openly gay supervillain in the city of Sacrament?" Rooftop Star asked.

"WHY DOES EVERYBODY THINK I'M GAY?" Tupperman buried his head in his cuffed hands, groaning.

I gave him a comforting pat on the shoulder. "There, there. ♫What do they know, anyway?♫"
