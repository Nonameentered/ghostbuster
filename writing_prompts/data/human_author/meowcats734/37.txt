**"But what if they're right?"** BgDkNRG typed. "What if burning fossil fuels is the reason why the oceans swallowed the coastlines?"

"Nonsense," KleenFuelOfficial replied. "The oceans have always been rising, and there were never any cities built on the coasts, anyway. It would have been far too dangerous for our ancestors in the 21st century to construct cities in places that would soon be flooded."

"That's the thing," BgDkNRG sent. "I don't think those cities were constructed in the 21st century—I think some of them go back way further. Like, you know the city of New York?"

"Yes, it's commonly known that it was fictional. There were *never any cities on the coast*. You hear me?"

"But if New York and Shanghai and Miami never existed, why are they referred to so consistently throughout movies and books from the 21st century? If there was never any animal life in the ocean, where do idioms like 'there are plenty of fish in the sea' come from? And if forests are nothing but a myth, what do we mean when we say that we 'can't see the forest for the trees?' The signs are everywhere! Hundreds of documents from the 21st century, all pointing towards the same thing."

"You must not have the officially updated versions of those approved media," KleenFuelOfficial typed. "Could I interest you in a subscription to a modernized version?"

"No. No, that's okay."

"I could offer you a 15% discount code."

"...Okay, DM it to me. But... I dunno. I know the air's too dangerous outside to get close enough for a dive, but I just want to see for myself, you know? Maybe there were never any cities on the coast, but there had to be *something* there. The roads that lead up to them—"

"Roads are a naturally-occurring phenomenon, not human-made. There is no significance in any of the locations they point to. Do you need further education?"

"Hey, I went through my required year of school, just like the rest of us. No, I'm... I'm fine. I'm just... it feels like something's missing. Like something's wrong."

"What's wrong is that you're missing out on great 15% off deals with KleenFuel Television! Subscribe today, and get Kleened-up films for great prices."

"Alright, alright. That... that does sound good."

"I'm very glad to hear it."

The thread ended there, and I leaned back from my ancient laptop, massaging my eyebrows.

It was a shame. They'd been so close to uncovering... well. Not the truth. Not anymore. A century of revision had put that too far out of reach. But they'd been on the precipice of discovering that once upon a time, there used to be *something* called the truth.

I closed the laptop, powering it down, and stood. No. There was no truth left to be found on the KleenNet anymore.

The bunker was trapped under twenty meters of seawater, but I didn't hunger or suffocate, and I'd managed to tap into the deep-sea cables that still carried internet across the world. It had been a good home, while it lasted, but I had had enough of today's lies.

I opened the airlock and prepared for the acidic, unpleasant swim to the surface.

There was *one* person who still remembered how things truly were, and I would not let the truth die so easily.
