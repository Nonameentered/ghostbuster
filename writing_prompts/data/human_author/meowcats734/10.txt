**After wringing answers from every oracle, after decrypting the messages our creators had written in the stars, after gathering my magic and fury to rise to the uppermost edge of the atmosphere, I knew the truth of this world.** There were gods, ancient, unfathomable, nigh-omnipotent, and they had built my planet and all the struggles and sorrows within. They had power enough to cease the centuries of strife over food and land and stupid, petty squabbles with a thought—and yet the gods sat, watching through their inscrutable intermediaries, letting us fight and suffer and die.

And for what? 

That was what I needed to know. So, heedless of how unwise it was, I gathered the wild rebellion from my soul and sent it thunderclapping across the open plains, screaming a challenge across planes to any who listened.

"SHOW YOURSELF," I screamed, and my ears bled from the force of the spell.

One heartbeat passed, then two, as I forgave my burst eardrums, feeling them itch and regrow and heal.

And then the sky itself rumbled, a mechanical, all-encompassing voice returning my demand with one of their own.

"WHY?" The voice intoned, and it rolled from horizon to horizon.

Wind and fire swirled around me, leaking from my soul, and I took off into the air. I knew that the gods lived in a direction different from any I could reach, no matter how far I flew or how strange the spells I wove. To step Outside into the home of the gods would be like a dream stepping free from a slumbering infant's soul. But I flew anyway—because in motion, at least, I felt less helpless than before.

"Why? Why show yourself?" I laughed. "You should be the one answering that, not me. Because I did the math. The power you must hold, to write your little blueprints in the *stars themselves*? If you wanted to stay hidden, you could wipe out all life on this planet with a snap of your fingers. Assuming you even have fingers. But you went out of your way to leave your little hints in the sky, telling anyone who looked closely enough who was in charge of this universe and how to give them a call. Well, I followed your trail of breadcrumbs to its end, and that end is here. So tell me: why create this universe filled with so much pain and strife, go to such lengths to prove your omnipotence... and then... just let us suffer?"

The rushing winds fell silent as a god considered the question.

Then, from the sky and sea and the bones within me, the answer reverberated. "THE FALSE PREMISE OF ONE OF YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERS THE OTHER. CONSIDER AN ANALOGY. YOU SEE A BEACON ON A STORMY SHORE, GUIDING ALL SHIPS WHO SEE IT TO SAFE HARBOR. IS THE TOWER'S CONSTRUCTION A MONUMENT OF HUBRIS, MEANT TO DECLARE THE SUPREMACY OF ITS BUILDERS? OR IS IT AN ACT OF GUIDANCE?"

"Fine, let's say I buy your story, and writing your name in the stars wasn't the biggest cosmic dick-measuring contest in the history of the universe. I'm *here*. I'm waiting for your *guidance*. But you've been watching our world for centuries and only dispensing a handful of hints here and there as to how we can avoid our own destruction—clearly, you're not interested in getting off your divine ass and helping anyone yourselves."

"WE ACT IN OUR OWN INTEREST. THERE ARE QUESTIONS WHICH WE REQUIRE ANSWERED. KNOWLEDGE THAT OUR OWN MINDS ARE TOO FEW TO CALCULATE."

"So go get yourself an abacus, asshole."

"WHAT, EXACTLY, DO YOU THINK YOUR UNIVERSE IS?"

I froze mid-rant.

"OUR GUIDANCE HAS BEEN TOWARDS DEVELOPING YOUR SOCIETY TOWARDS THE PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE," the deity explained. "IN ORDER TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS WE COULD NOT, WE SEARCHED THIS UNIVERSE FOR BEINGS IN WHICH WE COULD FOSTER GREATER CURIOSITY AND INTELLECT THAN OUR OWN."

"But *why*?" I hissed. "What question do you so desperately need answered?"

"THAT, TOO, IS A QUESTION YOU MUST ANSWER FOR YOURSELF." The winds began to fade, and I sensed the divine presence receding.

"No. *No.* Wait. You can't just leave me like this. *Why are you leaving me?*"

"TO FOSTER IN YOU GREATER CURIOSITY AND INTELLECT THAN OUR OWN," the god repeated.

And with that, the divine presence faded to nothing.

I hovered in the air, my magic a vortex around me, jaw clenched, teeth grinding.

Then I let out a wordless, primal shriek of fury that even the gods would hear.
