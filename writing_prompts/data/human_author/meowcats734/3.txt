**It was pretty obvious that the Silent Academy for Witchcraft was evil.** There were plenty of giveaways: the eldritch horrors that lived on campus, the harvesting of the students' emotions to fuel their war machine, the holes in Freio's memory that suspiciously occurred whenever the expert on memory erasure paid him a visit... and some people had taken that as a sign that the system was broken. That they needed to rebel.

Freio was pretty sure that following them would get him killed.

He admired their tenacity, of course. But he wasn't like them, able to charge time and time again into impossible odds without getting chewed up and spat out as a pile of bones and flesh. He was just another student trying to keep his head down and not run into any more abominations than he could handle. Secretly, even though they were his friends, he'd let out a sigh of relief when the ragtag party of rebels had their dramatic showdown and fled the Silent Academy.

But then the incidents started to pile up. Guided by an instinct he didn't understand, he'd refused to stand for the Oath of Obedience—and although his memories of what happened next had been erased like they always were whenever he tried to rebel, the bruises left on his body didn't fade. When he'd seen Kino shove some poor first-year against the wall, a voice had whispered in his ear that getting between the two of them would be the smart thing to do—and he'd limped away covered in burn marks from the fire witch's wrath afterwards.

Now he was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, wishing the school nurse hadn't been snapped up by the draft.

*You know this isn't right, Freio,* that voice whispered to him. *Cienne is a hero. You could be too.*

"He *was* a hero, Jan. Nobody even knows if he's still alive."

*And will you be, if you keep letting the Silent Peaks grind you to dust?*

"I'll have a better chance than if I try to fight."

*Don't* try *to fight. Win. I know you're scared, Freio. But it's now or never. You can't stay here forever.*

"I know," Freio whispered. "I'm just... so afraid."

*That's okay. I'm here for you. I know you can get back up.*

Freio took in a deep breath, closing his eyes.

Then he sat up, body aching as he steeled his resolve.

If he was going to be a hero, he was going to do it right.

It's late where I am, and I wrote this on a whim. Might continue later, or not.
