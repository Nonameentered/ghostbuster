**"God?"** The Devil idly cleaned his house-sized fingernails with Gregori's soul. "Who's that?"

Gregori winced as his head was dragged across the underside of the Devil's fingernails. It was a luxurious position, he told himself. Sure, the Devil was constantly on fire with the unholy fury of a hundred billion dead, but so was everything else around here. The fact that Gregori was still sane enough to hold a conversation already put his current situation a step up over most of his... compaions. "You know," Gregori managed to rasp. "The other one. If you live a virtuous enough life and follow the Bible, you can go to Heaven?"

"The... Bible?" The Devil paused to idly pick his nose as he thought. Gregori emerged wincing and covered in acid. Then, to Gregori's terror, the Devil began to laugh. "Oh! Ha, that thing's still going after all these years? I was *certain* people would figure out all the, ah, *edits* I made within a millenium."

Gregori wiped the acid free from his eyes—it burned the rest of his body, sure, but so did the air itself—and weakly said, "Edits?"

"Oh yeah. Like, Deuteronomy 21:18? Who the heck saw a book supposedly written by a 'benevolent' deity to set the laws of a good society and thought 'oh, yeah, *stoning your children to death* if they disobey you sounds like the kind of thing this God guy would want us doing?' I mean, I'll admit that was some of my lazier work, but hey, it kept you guys distracted and infighting for just that sweetest tiny bit longer."

"...fuck," Gregori muttered.

"Yeah, you guys have been doing a lot of that up there, too. What're you up to, seven billion? I really thought that what I did to the internet would get you guys to hit each other down to a manageable level before now."

Gregori frowned. "A... manageable level?"

The Devil paused, then scowled, craggy eyebrows like mountains descending in a storm of fury. "Oh, you sly little bastard. Don't you read too much into that, you accident of nature. Humanity is very well *managed*, thank you; I might've preferred the quick and easy answer of nuclear winter, but the slow cooker will get you all in another century or two, mark my words."

Gregori wasn't listening, his mind racing. If everything the Devil had done, up to and including lying to the world about his defeat and puppeting the corpse of his so-called conqueror, was for the purpose of keeping humanity divided and weak...

...then *that* meant there was something the Devil feared. A united, strong community of humans.

Even as Gregori had the thought, the massive caverns of Hell *shook.* Gregori twisted his head as the Devil did the same.

It was the head of a titanic, diamond-tipped drill.

The Devil roared in anger, and—was that a hint of pain? He whipped out one clawed hand, sending a stream of fire hotter than anything this side of a star towards the drill, melting it in its presumptuous entirety. The construct of mortal make was no match for the fires of hell itself, and it burst into slag and ash.

But it left Gregori's mind reeling.

Why had the Devil gone to such lengths to disinform and confuse humanity?

Because *help was on the way*. It may not be this year. Maybe not even this century. But humanity was progressing, and if the Devil didn't stop us... it wouldn't be drills and unmanned probes, but nanites and AI and things the Devil couldn't beat with a burst of fire.

Help was on the way.

And all they had to do was not let the Devil trick them into destroying themselves in the process.

Gregori laughed as the Devil stomped across Hell to throw him back in his eternal torment—because no matter how much the Devil tortured him, he had one thing the Devil could never take away.

Hope.
