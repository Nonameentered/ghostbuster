# Soulmage

**"I was his imaginary friend,"** I admitted. The soulmage on the other side of the cell bars was surprisingly young, but he'd done what the entire Crystal Court had failed at in an instant, outing me and inadvertently getting me thrown into the dungeon.

"Interesting," the soulmage said. "So you weren't a soulspace entity? You came from Prince Vrestik's soul?"

"As far as I know," I answered truthfully. There was no point in trying to deceive Cienne—if the young soulmage had seen through the lie that was my life in an instant, he'd surely pierce any lesser fibs I tried to fabricate. 

"Why didn't you tell anyone when Vrestik died?" Cienne asked. To my surprise, the soulmage seemed honestly curious, instead of accusatory or furious. Maybe... maybe I wouldn't be summarily executed here and now. Maybe there was still hope.

"He didn't die all at once," I admitted. "It was a thing of bits and pieces. At first, he handed off control to me for a few hours, just to get through a state dinner or a mind-numbing lesson. And... and I stepped in. How could I not? I was his friend. It was the least I could do."

I saw Cienne's eyes flash in understanding. "But that wasn't where it ended, was it?" he asked.

I gave him a rueful smile. "Of course not. If it was, I wouldn't be... well, I wouldn't be here." I gestured at the bars of my cell. "He asked me to take over for longer. A day where he didn't feel so well. A week when a difficult family member was coming over. And that week turned into a month, and that month turned into two, and even when I called out and begged he... just never came back." I swallowed. "So I kept on doing what he told me to. To live his life for him, until he returned."

The young soulmage's eyes swept over my—Vrestik's—body, and I felt his gaze pierce my very soul.

Then he said, "If Vrestik did come back, what would you do?"

I jerked. "What?"

"If—hypothetically speaking—Vrestik was still in your soul, just locked up behind walls of his own making..." The soulmage raised an eyebrow. "If you could bring him back. Would you?"

I grabbed the cage bars. "Yes. Yes, *please*. I'm—even if I wasn't locked up here, I... I miss him. I was his imaginary friend, but... he was mine too. The only person I could truly talk to." I shied away from the soulmage's gaze. "Until now."

Cienne gave me a warm smile. "Then maybe—*maybe*—there's still a way. Here's what we have to do..."
