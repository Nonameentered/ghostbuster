**"It's a whiskey maneuver,"** the drunken assassin said, "but I'll just have to grin and beer it."

"Is she always like this?" I asked, my brow creasing slightly. I may have been immortal in every relevant sense of the word, but that just meant that in my century-plus lifespan, I'd heard more or less every pun in the book. The last genuinely amusing one had been when I was a little under sixty years old, and it had been all downhill from there.

"Whiskey might be a little idiosyncratic," the Brewer said, "but she's worth it. Be patient."

"I can be patient longer than you can be alive," I idly said. "Whiskey."

The girl jerked to a sloppy attention. In my soulsight, I could see her soul practically *roiling* with strange, drunken emotions. How... peculiar. Everyone knew that magic and the mind were intimately related, although few knew the true depth of the connection as I did—but even I had never considered deliberately altering my bodily chemistry in order to warp the way my magic worked. Then again, I wasn't human; I didn't have body chemistry in the way nonmagical entities did. Nonmagical alcohol did nothing to me, and although I was certain the Distillery had all kinds of strange and proprietary concoctions, I doubted I was squeezing any of them from their tight little claws.

"I'm surprised you called me by my name," Whiskey said. "Most of our clients don't respect that."

"I know the importance of a name," I murmured. "Is she truly your strongest assassin? I hear she was the one behind Joyraze."

"We are, of course, not at liberty to discuss the dealings of our other clients," the Brewer calmly said. Strange. He was perfectly sober, and yet his soul... it was almost *too* organized, in contrast to Whiskey's bubbling mess of a soulspace. I would have to store the memory for later perusal. "But she is one of our best, yes."

"Hey. Don't you diss Agent N like that," Whiskey said.

I raised an eyebrow; behind me, the Brewer sighed. "Agent N?" I asked.

Whiskey grinned, and I could tell I'd fallen for another one of her puns. "Yeah. Know what the letter they give us when they want to put him on assignment is? 'Send Nudes.'"

"The price for the assassination—or attempt thereof—of as... prominent... a figure as you are asking for is... well, rather high," the Brewer said.

"Name it," I said.

"Two hundred human-years of memory," the Brewer promptly replied.

Ah. They took the currency of the higher planes, then. It was always a pleasure to meet someone who knew how the real game was played. Pieces of metal did have a certain power, I had to admit, that came from so many people feeling and thinking and remembering that they did. But that was nothing compared to the power of raw memory. "I shall pay the price myself," I said.

The Brewer raised an eyebrow. "You... most clients have their subordinates or, ah, *captives* pay the price for them. You... are aware that that is an option, yes?"

I rolled my shoulders. "I do not ask my comrades to bear a risk I would not take myself. That is, after all, the point of this exercise."

I did not have to close my eyes to enter my soulspace—I had long since transcended the need for that. I simply remembered the act of *cutting*, and a carefully cultivated section of memories I had absorbed over my lifespan simply calved off of my soul, two centuries of memory simply ripped from my soul.

I would recoup the losses shortly. It was nothing to an immortal Demon of Empathy such as I.

In soulspace, I transferred the swirling mass of memories that burned like tiny stars to the Brewer. He inhaled, pleased. "A curated collection," he said, his soul bifurcating and parallelizing as he broke down and absorbed the soul fragment. "How refined. Yes, I do believe this is *more* than adequate payment."

"Very well." I turned towards Whiskey. "You know who you are to assassinate?"

Whiskey lounged on the flat steel table, rolling her eyes. "Please. I'm a professional. I got the memo as soon as your order was put in." She slunk to her feet with a fluid grace. "You want me to assassinate *you*."

I spread my arms. "Then get on with it."

Whiskey gave me an insouciant gaze. "You know, I don't normally ask, but I have to wonder why you—"

Mid-sentence, her jovial attitude disappeared in a flash, and even my centuries of practice in the art of empathy didn't catch her hostile intent in the swirling miasma that was her drunken soul. She struck with three spells at once: a blade that cut space itself, a compressed point of incredible weight, even utilizing the elven art of gamma beams. My, she was quite the ferocious fighter.

Unfortunately for her, I was not alone.

The ten thousand strands of empathy that linked me to my comrades and friends flared to life, and every blow she struck was evenly distributed amongst us all. The blade that cut space was reduced to a mere nick against my chest; the crushing weight of a mountain was easily borne by ten thousand souls; even the corrupting light of the gamma knife was diluted to nothing when weakened ten thousandfold. Whiskey managed to give me a surprised look before I flicked my arm in counterattack. I disliked taking direct hits from serious fighters in combat—it pained me to harm my comrades, even if they shielded me willingly—so I wanted to end this as soon as possible.

In simultaneity, I filled the space between Whiskey and I with beams of perfect frost, and with a yank of my hand tore the ceiling onto her head. The Brewer gave me a distasteful look, stepping aside as the strange stars overhead burst into the room, but it had the desired effect. Forced into a situation where she could neither dodge nor block, the top assassin of the Distillery was nearly crushed—

Until I shot a string of empathy from my soul to hers, and spread out the blow over the entire Order of Valhalla.

Whiskey was still, of course, trapped beneath the rock, but I was certain she was ready to continue trying to kill me until she died of old age. So I turned to the Brewer and simply said, "The contract is off."

At that, he *tsk*ed and waved a hand; the chunk of ceiling that I had dropped on Whiskey flew aside. "We are, of course, here to satisfy our customers... but I would appreciate you taking your little tiff outside next time."

"Of course," I said smoothly. "My apologies. I simply had to make a point."

"Which was?" The Brewer asked, raising an eyebrow.

"You were hired by the Silent Peaks to try to assassinate me. When that failed, the Peaks attempted to use your assassins slay two of my most trusted generals, neither of whom fell. The purpose of this was to send a message." I let myself feel the fury burning within me—the memory of this moment would soon me distributed to every soldier in the Silent Peaks' army, after all. "*You do not harm those whom I care for.* You will fail, time and time again. And every soldier that you send against me?"

I tapped the string of empathy between me and Whiskey, the one that had saved her life when I was about to slay her. "I take better care of your assassins than you do your own soldiers' lives. When your army defects from beneath your feet, *remember that.*"

Then I tore open a rift between planes and left, leaving the Distillery of Assassins behind.

It would be fascinating to see how my opponents retaliated this time.
