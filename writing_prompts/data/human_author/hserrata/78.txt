\[Regretful Buddy\]

Frost sat in the dimmest corner of the bar alone. The blue-skinned teenager needed to return to school in less than half an hour. He'd taken to spending his lunch breaks in the bar when he could; but, this had been another uneventful visit. He checked the time on his node and wondered if he would have more success later in the evening, instead of midday. As it was the bar was empty except for the old drunk that was always there.
  
 
  
"I'll try later...," Frost mumbled to himself as he made the decision. Then, the saloon doors swung open and drew his attention. A golden retriever with a shiny golden coat padded into the saloon. He went straight to the bar and hopped up on one of the stools. Frost watched with amusement as the old drunk rushed to sit down next to the dog.
  
 
  
"Wanna hear a story boy?" the old man asked.
  
 
  
"Yes," the dog nodded. Frost was surprised at a talking dog, but he recovered quickly. He'd seen so many strange things since he started attending school that, on second thought, it seemed almost inevitable that he'd run into a talking dog.
  
 
  
"I call this one the shifting forest...," the old man said. Frost was surprised again when the dog shook his head and hopped off the bar stool.
  
 
  
"No thanks," the dog replied as it left the bar. Frost glanced at the time again and realized he couldn't wait too long before acting. This is what he was there for, assuming the dog came back in. Frost hurried and stood from the table to stand by the door. The dog entered again just as he reached it.
  
 
  
"Hi," Frost smiled at the dog. It turned and looked at him.
  
 
  
"Hi," he nodded. His voice was friendly. "Is there something I can do for you?" Frost shook his head.
  
 
  
"I wanted to help you, but I'm kind of in a hurry," he said. "Are you looking for the Divine Blessing quest?" he asked.
  
 
  
"Yes," the dog nodded. "My name's Buddy," he added.
  
 
  
"I'm Frost," he extended his hand out of habit. But, Buddy turned and gave him his paw just the same. Frost knelt to make the handshake easier, then they let go.
  
 
  
"The trick is, you have to be in a group to accept the quest," Frost said. As he explained it, he sent a party invite to Buddy. However, the system replied instantly.
  
 
  
\[User is already in a Party\]
  
 
  
"I am...," Buddy replied.
  
 
  
"What?" Frost was surprised. That was the way it worked when Flutter helped him get the quest. Now he was feeling rushed and embarrassed. But, he'd already promised to help Buddy. He replayed the quest in his memory as best he could. It wasn't particularly long, but he spent most of it in awe of Flutter. "Oh!" he chuckled when he realized it.
  
 
  
"Sorry," he shook his head. "I kind of didn't pay attention the first time, but I figured it out. The quest needs two paladins."
  
 
  
"Oh, okay," Buddy nodded. Then, Frost received an invitation in the bottom left corner of his view.
  
 
  
\[Buddy invited you to a party. Join?\]
  
\[Yes\] \[No\] Frost accepted.
  
 
  
\[/party: Welcome! -Clara\] Frost heard a woman's voice in his mind and felt the Whisper text on his wrist. She quickly answered Frost's curiosity about who else was in the group. Now it was just the three of them.
  
 
  
\[/party: Thank you! -Frost\] he replied with his own Whisper. Buddy wandered to the bar stool again and hopped on. The old man sat down next to him.
  
 
  
"Wanna hear a story, boy?" he asked.
  
 
  
"Yes," Buddy nodded. 
  
 
  
"I call this one the Blessing of Divinity. Although not all of it might be true,-"
  
 
  
"I accept," Buddy hopped off the stool and returned to Frost.
  
 
  
"Thank you," he said. Frost shook his head.
  
 
  
"Don't thank me yet," he said. "It takes two Paladins to complete the quest; but, I've got to get back to school. Can you wait until later?" he asked. "If you can't, I know someone that might be able to help," he said. Despite the fact that she was nothing but friendly, Frost hesitated to refer to Flutter as a friend; he looked up to her too much for them to be equal. However, he knew that she'd be up for helping if she was able.
  
 
  
"School?" Buddy asked. His tail wagged with interest. "You're a Unique... do you go to Toku-high?" he asked. Frost nodded.
  
 
  
"I've been mildly interested in the school, but I hadn't made the opportunity to visit yet. Since I'm waiting, would you mind if I tagged along with you?" he asked. 
  
 
  
"You're a Unique too, right?" Frost asked. The fact that he was a talking dog almost guaranteed it; but, it didn't hurt to be sure. In fact, it was likely to hurt Buddy if he wasn't. Luckily, Buddy nodded.
  
 
  
"#46, El Sol," he said.
  
 
  
"Sure, you can come," he said. "No Zeros allowed, Ms. Sharp is pretty strict about that. But, nowhere in the rules does it say a dog can't attend school." Frost replied. "She might even want to meet you herself," he said.
  
 
  
"I'd prefer to avoid that if possible," Buddy shook his head. Frost was surprised. He couldn't imagine someone not wanting to meet the most powerful woman in the multiverse.
  
 
  
"You.. don't want to meet her?" he asked. "Why not?" He realized he was close to being late and he pulled a black card out of his node. He threw it on the bar floor and it opened a black portal.
  
 
  
"We've met," Buddy answered. That was the entirety of his answer as the two of them stepped onto the portal. They began to sink into it and he elaborated.
  
 
  
"As for 'why not’...," Buddy sighed. "To use your phrase, nowhere in the rules does it say that a dog can’t have regrets.”
