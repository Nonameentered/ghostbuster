Van'Droth wandered the halls of his castle with his nose in the air. It was a cool, crisp fall morning like they had all been lately; but, this particular morning was filled with unfamiliar but appetizing odors. The lean, wrinkled man with long, stringy black hair found his way into the kitchen to find his prisoner, Princess Gloryemma, surrounded by a mess of her own making.
  
 
  
"What's all this?" Van'Droth asked. He tended to be lenient on the princess; the poor, spoiled girl seemed too dim to comprehend she was a prisoner. He had no intention of harming her. She was a means to an end. As soon as someone tried to rescue her, anyway. 
  
 
  
"It's Thanksgiving, VanD!" The green-haired princess grinned at him. "I've still got a lot to do, wanna lend a hand?" she asked.
  
 
  
"No," Van'Droth shook his head. He stopped trying to discourage the 'VanD' nickname after the first week and it bothered him less by now. But, he was looking forward to her eventual rescue attempt so he'd never have to hear it again. He took a closer look at all the half-prepared food and realized there was a lot. "Where'd all that come from?" he asked.
  
 
  
"Delivery," Gloryemma shrugged. "You said I can't go out."  Van'Droth sighed and chuckled to himself. If nothing else, her stupidity amused him.
  
 
  
"If you're not going to help, go wait somewhere else," she said. "You're slowing me down and -,"  her plea was interrupted by heavy knocks on the door. "-they're here already??" Gloryemma looked surprised, and Van'Droth was instantly giddy.
  
 
  
"Are they here to rescue you!??" he asked. Gloryemma looked around the cluttered kitchen, then sighed. "I sure hope so...," she said. She eyed Van'Droth. "It'd be nice if SOMEONE helped me. Go let them in," she said. Van'Droth nodded.
  
 
  
"Oh yes! Finally!" he debated greeting his guests in his dragon form; but, he liked to surprise his enemies. A lot of them assumed he was just a frail old man. "Okay, play it cool," Van'Droth reminded himself once he reached the tall wooden door. He hunched over and tried to make himself smaller; then, he pulled the door open.
  
 
  
"Yes...?" he asked innocently as he stuck his head out to take a look. "FLUTTER!? Don't hurt me!?" he threw himself on his knees as soon as he recognized the towering, pale, red-headed woman. She wasn't alone and stood next to a green-haired woman that looked a lot like Princess Gloryemma; but, Van'Droth was too distracted to notice much about her.
  
 
  
"Van'Droth?" Flutter asked. "What are you doing here?" He recognized surprise in her voice, which was good. It meant she wasn't there exclusively to kill him. He might have a chance of surviving the evening after all. Flutter was known to be among the strongest and friendliest dragons ever. And Van'Droth was feeling braver knowing that Flutter was there for some other reason; though, he had no idea what it was.
  
 
  
"I live here...," he said. He looked up, then stood. Even with his back straightened, she still stood over a foot taller than him. "Why are you here?" he asked.
  
 
  
"We're here for dinner!" The green-haired woman said. Now that Van'Droth gave her some attention he noticed she was holding a pie. She looked too much like Princess Gloryemma for it to be a coincidence. She had the same shade of green hair, though with an extra streak of silver running through it.
  
 
  
"What? Why?" Van'Droth asked.
  
 
  
"Are you going to invite them in, or are we eating by the door?" Princess Gloryemma appeared behind Van'Droth. "Happy Thanksgiving!" she flew past him and hugged the green-haired woman next to Flutter, then, she shook Flutter's hand.
  
 
  
"Okay, hold on a minute...," Van'Droth spoke up. "...this is getting silly." He focused on Princess Gloryemma. "I've been lenient, but there are limits. This is no way for a prisoner to behave!" he said. She tilted her head at him.
  
 
  
"I'm a prisoner?" she asked. He nodded vigorously. "Since when?"
  
 
  
"Since I kidnapped you! I've been waiting a month for the squad of knights that's supposed to try and rescue you."
  
 
  
"You kidnapped me??" Princess Gloryemma burst into laughter along with the other two women. "I thought you just needed a roommate. There's no one coming to rescue me, I told them I was fine living on my own," she said.
  
 
  
"Well, clearly you were wrong," Van'Droth said. "You're my prisoner and I suggest you ask for a rescue soon," he said. Princess Gloryemma turned and looked up at Flutter.
  
 
  
"Will you rescue me?" she asked.
  
 
  
"Sure," Flutter nodded and stared at Van'Droth. "You're rescued," she said. Van'Droth's shoulders slumped. He knew there was no arguing against Flutter.
  
 
  
"Well..., now that all that confusion is cleared up...," Van'Droth stepped aside and gestured down the hall. "...would you like to come in for dinner?" he asked.
  
 
  
"No," Princess Gloryemma shook her head. "Have fun cleaning up the mess your prisoner made, we're going somewhere else for dinner."
