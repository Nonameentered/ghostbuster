"Looking back on it, it feels like I've always known," Alis said. The teen girl with chestnut curls and pink highlights walked next to her friend, Surge; he was a lanky teen boy with dark blue, shaggy hair. They were on the way to the gym for practice and walked outside of the school. Gleaming white buildings sat around them as they followed one of the many red brick paths. "I've been able to see Auras all my life. And, when I was little, I experienced my first teleportation event," Alis giggled at the pleasant memory.
  
 
  
"I didn't know the term 'Traverse' yet, I wasn't even sure I'd teleported; but, everything just felt different...," she said.
  
 
  
"Yeah," Surge nodded. "I know the feeling," he chuckled. "How old were you?"
  
 
  
"Around 5, I think. I remember we made it a big family outing because it was supposed to snow that evening," Alis explained as they walked past other students. "I'd never seen snow yet so we packed up a picnic blanket and a basket with hot chocolate and treats and went and sat at the park."
  
 
  
"And?" Surge asked after waving to a friend. "How'd it go?"
  
 
  
"We waited for three hours...," Alis sighed. "...it never snowed. I threw a heck of a tantrum when my parents said it was time to go home. I'm talking eyes closed and stomping feet," Alis giggled again.
  
 
  
"Then, it started to snow."
  
 
  
"You Traversed?" Surge asked. Alis nodded.
  
 
  
"According to my parents, I just vanished. I watched the snowfall for a little while, but then I noticed my parents weren't with me. We found each other as soon as I wanted to find them again. It wasn't snowing anymore, but they saw the snow in my hair and on my clothes. And, they saw me reappear. I know it happened a few times after that, but I never stayed anywhere long enough to meet another Unique. I'm lucky I met Steph on my Earth," she added.
  
 
  
"Can I ask what it was like for you?" She asked. "What was it like being an NPC?"
  
 
  
"Molly," he said. The two reached an intersection, then turned left towards more white buildings.
  
 
  
"What?" Alis spoke up quickly. "What about her?" she asked.
  
 
  
"It feels blank like I was asleep. I remember attacking you and her; but, it just feels like a dream now," he shook his head. "My first real, clear thought was when she was healing me. I was grateful. You asked me if I was going to cause any trouble," he looked at her with a smile. "I felt like I wanted to, but I didn't have a reason. I went home and went straight to sleep. When I woke up the next day, my mind was crystal clear. I knew that I wanted to find Molly again, and I knew where she'd be."
  
 
  
"That was the most fun I've had at a wedding," Alis replied. Surge nodded.
  
 
  
"Me too," he added. "And, I'm glad Molly got her quest done."
  
 
  
"Yeah, I love helping her out," Alis nodded as they reached the gym doors. Surge couldn't help but notice a faint, dreamy tone in her voice.
  
 
  
"Yeah," Surge added. "She's pretty great, isn't she?" He opened the door to let her go in first.
  
 
  
"Yeah," Alis sighed pleasantly as she walked by. "She's wonderful."
