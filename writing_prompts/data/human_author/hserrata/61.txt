"Come on...," Gala begged the sliver of flint. She held the starter near the pilot light and clicked it again. "...just one good spark!" The old propane range was supposed to be a last resort. The final round was underway and thanks to the cutthroat competition she needed to resort to it. Once she made it to the last round she went back to her booth to get started but the stove had mysteriously exploded.
  
 
  
As usual, no one saw anything and equipment was the responsibility of the competitor. Gala knew the judges wouldn't be any help; they never were. The only thing that mattered was the jam she delivered. She prepared as well as she could have with as many backup tools as she could find. She did not expect to have to use the range; but, she brought plenty of propane and three lighters just in case. She was now using a fourth option that she didn't know she brought along. The old flint lighter that she found in the bottom of her toolbox was her only hope. She clicked it rapidly next to the pilot; but, the weak sparks weren't enough. And soon, the flint was gone completely.
  
 
  
"I'm not giving up...," Gala looked up and scanned the fairgrounds for the closest tree. As searched, she caught sight of faint pink smoke floating past her on the breeze. She turned around out of curiosity and a large plume of pink spoke washed across her face; it smelled like bubblegum.
  
 
  
"You really should give up," Gala heard the voice before she could see. Once the smoke cleared a short stranger stood in her stall. She was covered from head to toe with a dark violet, almost black garb. But, Gala could still see the girl's eyes.
  
 
  
"Now they're sending ninjas?" Gala asked aloud. At this point, she was used to the extremes her competitors went to. And, she was used to dealing with any issues on her own. No one would pay attention if she screamed for help; she never did. In a way, she was thankful. Now she had a valid excuse to give up. She didn't have to try anymore. "I kind of wish it was the baby dragon from the last fair...," Gala giggled.
  
 
  
"You... remember the last fair...?" the ninja tilted her head at Gala. Golden stars glowed in her eyes as she studied the woman. "Oh no...," the ninja whined like a teenage girl and shook her head. "no no no...," she flicked her wrist upward and a grey pane of glass appeared in the air before her. It was about 3' x 3', Gala had a good sense for measurements. The ninja moved her fingers on the surface, then she stopped and looked back at Gala.
  
 
  
"Can your jam win?" The ninja asked.
  
 
  
"What??" Gala's mind still hadn't caught up to what was going on in front of her. She wasn't ready for any question; much less that one. She was waiting for her chance to surrender. She was determined to win, up to a point. But, it wasn't worth risking her life. She knew the ninja was mostly meant to be a scare tactic; but, she wasn't feeling particularly brave at the moment.
  
 
  
"It's a long story, and you're already on the clock," the ninja replied. I'll explain it like this: I bet on someone else to win this. But, something went wrong and you're messing everything up. "
  
 
  
"Good," Gala nodded. She didn't appreciate being threatened.
  
 
  
"It kind of is," the ninja agreed with a giggle. "But, I'll explain that later. It took me a long time to get this far in the quest, and I'm almost done. But, thanks to you, I don't know who is going to win anymore. I think it might be you," she added. "So, do you think it might be you?"
  
 
  
"If you don't stop me, I think I have a pretty good chance," Gala nodded. 
  
 
  
"And what if I help you?" as she asked, the ninja pulled her hood off. She was a teenage girl with short, dark hair and pink highlights. "My name's Alis," she said. 
  
 
  
"Gala," she gave her own name. "But, you probably knew that." 
  
 
  
"Nope," Alis shook her head. "You were just Competitor #10. Nice to meet you, Gala. How can I help?" 
  
 
  
"Got a light?" Gala gestured at the old range. 
  
 
  
"Sure," Alis lifted her hand and aimed her palm forward. 
  
 
  
\[Fireball\] Gala heard a deep voice fill the air around them. A bright pink fireball shot out of her hand and lit the pilot. It burned pink with golden smoke for a bit, but it eventually settled into an orange, smokeless flame. She looked up at Gala. 
  
 
  
"What else?"
