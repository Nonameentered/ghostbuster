"What's your favorite number?" The question startled Aracelli enough to make her jump. She was a trained assassin that usually knew how to keep her cool; though, lately, she'd been lowering her guard more and more. Especially when it came to her employer, Mr. Noble. She entered his room while he was out to prepare for his return when she was surprised. She whirled around and saw Mr. Noble's newest guard, Abby. But, she answered the unexpected question before she could wonder why Abby was present.
  
 
  
"33!" Aracelli answered. "Why?" she followed her answer immediately with a question. She had no idea why she answered, she did not know she had a favorite number at all. The teen guard sighed and her shoulders slumped with obvious disappointment.
  
 
  
Aracelli thought it was strange that Mr. Noble hired a teenage girl as a guard; but, the teen had proven herself in combat. She was a skilled Paladin that used holy magic to great effect. Abby was a pale girl with dark hair and a black visor over her eyes; she wore black chainmail armor that never made a sound.
  
 
  
"I don't want to start all over...," Abby ignored Aracelli's question entirely as she whined under her breath. The teen flicked her wrist upward and a large glassy, grey pane appeared in the air before her. Aracelli watched as Abby touched and tapped on the floating surface.
  
"Why did you ask me my favorite number?" Aracelli asked.
  
 
  
"Because you haven't tried to kill Mr. Noble yet," Abby replied with an almost bored tone. Her focus was solely on the hovering slate. Her eyes moved left to right as if she was reading something, but Aracelli could not see anything on the grey glass. The moment she mentioned Aracelli's mission, the assassin stepped back cautiously. If Abby knew who she was, the rest of the guardsmen probably did too.
  
 
  
"What are you talking about?" Aracelli tried stalling to plan her escape. The windows of Mr. Noble's spacious bedroom were closed and locked; she would need to break through if she wanted out.
  
 
  
"You're supposed to try and assassinate Mr. Noble, and I'm supposed to protect him. But, you should have tried already."
  
 
  
"I won't...," Aracelli said. Despite the subject matter, Abby did not seem to be calling for help. Maybe if she was honest, she could reason with the girl. She already knew too much for Aracelli to lie her way out. "...I love him...," she said. It was the first time she voiced her emotions out loud and she felt a faint flutter in her heart when she heard herself say it.
  
 
  
"You love him??" Abby looked up at her with a crooked grin, then she laughed and shook her head. "You know he's never going to love you back, right?" she asked. She made a dismissive gesture with her hand and the floating pane disintegrated into nothing.
  
 
  
"Why not?" Aracelli asked. Abby seemed open to the conversation and it encouraged her. "He's single and we share a lot in common, why can't we live happily ever after?"
  
 
  
"A few reasons," Abby replied. "I'll start with the obvious one; he's a fictional character," she said.
  
 
  
"What??" the statement made no sense to Aracelli; she interacted with him daily, including that very morning. She was now standing in his room.
  
 
  
"Um, so, it's like this...," Abby shrugged. "I'm playing a game right now; Mr. Noble is a game character to me. You were too up until some point, I guess whenever you decided you were in love. Everyone here is fiction. This whole world is a game to me and you're all characters in that game. That's how I know you're an assassin, that's the whole point of what I'm doing here. You try to kill him, I stop you, then I get a reward that helps my character."
  
 
  
Aracelli shook her head because she did not want it to be true. But, the feeling that it was true took root inside her gut. She did not want to believe what Abby was saying but it somehow rang true. She could not find the words to argue against that point and chose a different angle.
  
 
  
"And, so what?" She asked Abby. "It happened to me, that means it can happen to him too, somehow. I won't give up on him," she said. Even if what Abby was saying was true, and Aracelli started to believe it was, that meant it was true before she knew it. She fell in love with him, whether he was fictional or not, and as long as she could interact with him regularly, she would be happy. "If I love him enough maybe...," her protests were interrupted by Abby shaking her head again.
  
 
  
"That's just one reason," Abby replied. "There's another important one. A lot of times when this happens, and it does happen kind of often I guess," she shrugged. Aracelli smiled at that but Abby kept talking. "When it happens, the quest is usually broken in some way that can't be completed. But, I just checked the quest log...," Abby said. Her smile grew broader as she took a step towards Aracelli. "...you're still tagged as the assassin."
  
 
  
"What.. does that mean?" Aracelli asked. She took another nervous step back; she got the impression that Abby was done indulging her conversation.
  
 
  
"Between the quest I'm on and your favorite number," Abby stepped forward again and pulled her black visor down to reveal the two large spiders living in her eye sockets. "...it means I get two upgrades for killing you."
