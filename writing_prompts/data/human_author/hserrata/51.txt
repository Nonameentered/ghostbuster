\[Ace. Lucky.\]

"That takes care of the guards...," Ace nodded to himself in satisfaction; his blonde curls bobbed with the motion. Corpses in black and silver robes littered the gym floor. The cult took up residence in an old abandoned high school. They were about to conduct a ceremony before Ace interrupted. "Now there's just...," Movement caught Ace's eye. A human-sized cage sat in the center of the gym; a frightened, shivering woman hugged her knees inside the cage. 
  

  
"Hello?" Ace approached the cage; he reloaded his shotgun on the way. 
  

  
"Hello!" The woman looked up at him through the bars. Red runes glowed around the cage door on the dark metal. "Is it safe? Will you help me?" the prisoner asked. 
  

  
"Oh...," Ace replied to her question with obvious disappointment. He nodded with a distinct lack of enthusiasm. "...yeah, I'll get you out. Hold on." He took a couple of steps back from the cage door and aimed his shotgun at it. Then, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a red translucent die. He shook the single die in his hand, then tossed it on the ground. It hit the ground and bounced into the side of the cage. After a moment of tumbling around it finally landed on a side. 
  

  
\[One\] a deep voice filled the air and a single white dot flashed above the die on the ground. 
  

  
"Oh come on, give me a three at least...," Ace lifted his shotgun up and fired a small, pale puff of red smoke into the air. Then, he pointed it forward again and he crouched to collect the die. He shook it, then tossed it on the ground again.
  

  
"Please hurry," the woman begged him. "More cultists could arrive at any moment!" 
  

  
"Nah, it'll be fine," Ace shook his head but he kept his focus on the die.
  

  
\[Six\] the deep voice spoke and six white dots flashed above the die.
  

  
"Now we're talking!" Ace chuckled. "Okay, you can come out now," Ace said. He reached forward to undo the lock, then he opened the cage door. The red runes stopped glowing as soon as the door opened. The woman stepped a single foot out the door and began to smile ominously.
  

  
"YOU FOOL!" Her face became dark and red with scales as she hissed at him. But, a shotgun blast interrupted her reveal. A giant plume of red smoke fired out of the barrel. The woman burst into flames in the cage. She screamed in agony as her body disintegrated into an ash heap. 
  

  
"I really don't want to be farming this all day...," Ace mumbled to himself as he stepped over the corpses and walked out of the gym. After a few minutes, he walked back into the gym with his shotgun ready. The cultists were about to start an important ceremony but one of the guards noticed Ace.
  

  
"Intruder!" he yelled. A dozen members in robes charged at Ace from all sides. The henchmen were simple enough to dispatch with the shotgun alone; and, soon, he made his way to the cage in the center of the gym.
  

  
"Hello?" Ace prompted the survivor. The pale, malnourished woman looked up at him; but, she did not respond. Ace smiled at her quiet reaction and stepped closer to the cage. Blue runes appeared on the cage door and Ace cheered to himself. 
  

  
"It's okay, you're safe now," Ace reassured her as he opened the door. The woman took extra time to build her courage. But finally, she trusted him enough to step out of the cage. Once she did, the voice filled the air again.
