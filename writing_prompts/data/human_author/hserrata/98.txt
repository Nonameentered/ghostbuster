\[Sharp Introduction\]

"Where's everyone else?" Frost wondered aloud as he made his way across the campus. He was surrounded by gleaming white buildings but they all appeared to be empty. The first door he tried was locked and he followed the sidewalk to the next one to try again. It was locked too; but, he spotted someone moving through the hallway and knocked on the door. It was a dark-haired teenage girl and she pushed the door open.
  
 
  
"Hi," she said. But, she did not open the door wider to let him in.
  
 
  
"Uh.. this is Toku-high, right?" Frost asked. She nodded. "I'm a new student here," he added. "My name's Frost," he extended his hand and she shook it with a smile.
  
 
  
"I'm Dara," she replied. "But, there are no classes today; it's Sunday," she said.
  
 
  
"It's Monday...," Frost shook his head. Her smile grew broader.
  
 
  
"Maybe on your Earth, but Toku-high follows SST."
  
 
  
"SST?" Frost asked.
  
 
  
"Sharp Standard Time," Dara replied. "It's a timestream that coordinates the multiverse." She held up a transparent glass card. "Did you get a node yet?" she asked. Frost shook his head.
  
 
  
"I got a black card that let me make a portal to this Earth and I was told that I'd get everything else I needed once I got here."
  
 
  
"Oh, well, here you go. Pull this," she presented the node while still firmly grasping one end of it. Frost reached for it and pulled. The glass stretched between them like taffy until it doubled in length; then, it separated leaving each of them with a complete node.
  
 
  
"That node will let you make your own black cards," she said as she held hers up and pulled a pitch black card out of the transparent device. She threw the card against the nearest wall and a tall black portal opened. Then, she touched her node to it and the portal disappeared. "And you can use it like a smartphone on your Earth or text and call people in different universes."
  
 
  
"Whoa...," Frost was impressed. He had the ability to cover himself in ice and knew there were other strange and exciting things waiting for him at the school. But, he never imagined that level of technology existing. "...everyone gets one?" he asked. "For free?" Dara nodded.
  
 
  
"They're provided by Sharp Development; the company that owns and operates this school," she said. Frost tilted his head.
  
 
  
"Did they also create SST?" he asked. The name 'Sharp' couldn't have been a coincidence. Dara nodded.
  
 
  
"Yeah, the head of the company, Ms. Sharp, is kind of amazing," she said.
  
 
  
"No doubt..," Frost nodded in awe.
  
 
  
"So...I hope you don't think I'm being nosy; but, I am curious. If it's Sunday, what are you doing here?" he asked. "Are you a student?" Dara nodded.
  
 
  
"I'm headed to roller derby practice," she said. Frost looked Dara up and down for a moment. She wore a white t-shirt with a logo that looked like red scissors, blue jeans, and sneakers. She wasn't carrying anything either.
  
 
  
"No skates?" he asked. Her eyes widened slightly as if someone had given her a small, but thoughtful gift.
  
 
  
"You didn't have a node," she grinned. "That means you haven't made your character yet, right?" She moved out of the way and pushed the door open wider. "You haven't seen AlterNet derby yet either."
  
 
  
Frost shook his head as she rattled off rhetorical questions and he decided to accept her invitation. He stepped into the school now that she was out of the way.
  
 
  
"It's so much fun," she said. "Let's go," she let the door close and began walking down the hall. Frost followed her.
  
 
  
"AlterNet derby is the main sport here," she said. "Did you have MMO games on your Earth?" she asked.
  
 
  
"Yeah," Frost nodded.
  
 
  
"So, imagine that crossed with roller derby. When you make your character you get to choose your class from 25 options. It's usually played in teams, so you have to be coordinated with your group; it's like PvP where you're trying to take the other team down. But it all takes place on a big track that both teams are skating on."
  
 
  
"Whoa... that does sound fun," he said. "Is paladin one of the classes?" he asked. He always chose to play a paladin in any game that had them available. Dara nodded and it prompted another question from Frost.
  
 
  
"What class are you?" he asked.
  
 
  
"I'm a ranger," she replied.
  
 
  
'Nice," Frost nodded. He didn't have anything to add to that. But, he was glad that there were at least two familiar classes; he was looking forward to seeing the rest even if he already knew his choice. Dara led him around a corner and then stopped.
  
 
  
Two women stood ahead of them in conversation. The shorter, plumper woman had dark hair and wore a black suit that reminded Frost of a high-class chauffeur. The taller woman also had short dark hair. She was paler than the woman in black and wore a crisp white suit.
  
 
  
"That's Ms. Sharp!" Dara said in a hushed whisper. "The one in white; the one in black is her wife, Melody."
  
 
  
"Ms. Sharp that runs the school?" Frost asked just to be sure. Though, she was the only Ms. Sharp he'd heard of. He was quickly learning that the multiverse was huge and he didn't want to make an assumption.
  
 
  
"And Sharp Development," Dara reminded him with a nod. Frost watched as a black portal appeared in the air and the woman in black stepped through it and disappeared. Once the portal closed, Ms. Sharp turned and looked at the two teens with a broad smile on her face.
  
 
  
"Dara!" she held her arms out to ask for a hug and asked a question. "Who's your friend?"
  
 
  
Frost was surprised when the important stranger recognized Dara; but, he wasn't prepared for his new friend to run into the woman's arms.
  
 
  
"Hi mom!" she grinned as she embraced the woman. Then, she turned and nodded at him. "This is Frost."
