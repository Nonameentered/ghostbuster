Oh wow, thank you for keeping up and for the question. Martin was introduced to the AlterNet and is off exploring on his own. He may or may not show up again depending on prompts.

[Emily](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/9z4uen/wp_you_are_the_worlds_most_powerful_sorcerer/) first appeared in 2018. She is a more prominent character that was [invited to Toku-high](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/p9deni/cw_smash_em_up_sunday_humuhumunukunukuapuaa/) by Aurelio Luna last year. But, that was a different timeline. After the [finale](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/wshhdf/wp_theres_a_legend_in_your_school_about_the_night/) of [Aurelio's Sun](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/wsgujp/pm_the_future_of_the_multiverse_hangs_in_the/), Aurelio is dead and Ms. Sharp was able to rewrite the timeline. Though, it's not perfect and [some hints remain](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/wz0g1c/wp_your_life_as_an_adventurer_sucks_whereas/im12ks4/).

It's a whole new freshman year at Toku-high and in this version, Aurora (Aurelio's daughter), is the one that invited Emily to attend the school.
