\[Known Truth\]

"Mister, you look like you've had a rough day," the waitress smiled at Ruben as soon as she appeared next to his table. He chuckled at the understatement and nodded. He took his eyes off her deep green hair to glance at her nametag.
  
 
  
"Gloria, you wouldn't believe me if I told you," he replied. The newspaper convinced him of when and where he was, but it was difficult to wrap his mind around. "I'm not even sure I believe it myself…," he added.
  
 
  
"Well, what can I get you while you sort yourself out?" she asked.
  
 
  
"Um…just a glass of cold water please," he said. He hoped that would be free at least. But, the waitress shook her head and her broad smile somehow managed to grow wider.
  
 
  
"I'm going to ask you again," she said. "But this time, order anything you like. Don't worry about the check, it's on me. I don't what you lost a fight against, but I'm guessing you left your money in your other torn pants. Now, what can I get you while you sort yourself out?"
  
 
  
"Cheeseburger?" he asked.
  
 
  
"And an iced tea," Gloria nodded with a smile and whirled around. Ruben sighed to himself now that he was alone. That was the moment he realized he really was alone. He wasn't the only astronaut chosen for the mission; but, he was the only one that survived the crash.
  
 
  
For a brief period, he thought he really was on another planet. The landscape was barren where they landed; and, he was able to breathe the atmosphere just fine. Then, he heard the helicopters. His first instinct was to run and he did. He found a road around the time he realized that they might have been looking for him because the mission failed. He hadn't launched from Earth; but, he realized that's where he landed.
  
 
  
He followed the road to town and picked up a newspaper on his way into the diner. But now he was trapped in the past almost 50 years before his own birth. At least he had a warm meal on the way. His gaze drifted out the window; but, he wasn't looking at anything. He was too lost in his own thoughts. But, he jumped a little when someone interrupted him.
  
 
  
"You don't belong here," Ruben turned and found a dark-haired teenage girl. She was pale and her short bob cut framed her face perfectly. She wore a white t-shirt with a red logo on it that looked like a pair of scissors and she was looking directly at him.
  
 
  
"What?" he asked. She seemed to be waiting for him to engage in conversation. She slid into the seat across the table from him as soon as he replied.
  
 
  
"This isn't your Earth," she replied. "I can get you home if you want."
  
 
  
"Who are you? What are you talking about?" he asked. Ruben wanted to get home more than anything; but, he was still cautious. Her appearance and her offer were a little too convenient.
  
 
  
"My name's Dara Sharp," she replied.
  
 
  
"Well, hello Dara," Gloria was there again and she smiled at the teen. "Can I get you something?"
  
 
  
"Rootbeer float," Dara nodded. "Thanks, Gloria!" she added as Gloria walked away. When she was gone Dara turned her attention back to Ruben. "Alternate Earths exist. You left yours looking for another planet; but, you crashed on this Earth instead," she explained.
  
 
  
"Assuming any of that was true...," Ruben tried to play it down out of caution. But, he had nothing to lose. "...how would you know?"
  
 
  
"My mom's company knows how to track situations like this, it happens a lot," she said.
  
 
  
"What... happens a lot?" Ruben asked. He was willing to accept her explanation and her help because that was all he had. But, he still had questions he wanted answered. And she was giving him even more.
  
 
  
"Astronauts from one Earth think they're going to another planet and end up on a different Earth instead. Your home Earth has already been contacted, and they know you're okay," her smile faded a bit. "And they know the rest of the crew isn't."
  
 
  
"Oh...," Ruben nodded. If it weren't for the fact that she knew so much about what happened, he would be inclined to dismiss her as insane. But something about what she knew and what she said added up in his mind. He recognized that he likely wasn't in his right mind at the moment, but everything was happening too fast. All he needed to know was that he might actually see his family again. "... other Earths are real?" he asked.
  
 
  
"They are?" Gloria appeared with his food and Dara's float.
  
 
  
"Yup!" Dara nodded. She pulled a transparent card from somewhere under the table and offered it to Gloria. "If you want to explore them, you can use this," she said.
  
 
  
Gloria set the food down and accepted the card. The time appeared on it in red numbers and Ruben immediately believed everything she'd said. That technology was beyond what he'd seen on his own Earth. Gloria, for her part, seemed to take it all in stride even better than Ruben.
  
 
  
"Well, thank you, Dara. I might have to take a look after work," she grinned as she slid the card into the pocket of her pink uniform. "You two enjoy, and let me know if you need anything else," Gloria said. Then, she turned and left.
  
 
  
"Wait a second...," Ruben said. His stomach growled at being made to wait. "You just told her you were from another Earth... and she believed you?? Why??" he asked. Ruben believed her because he had to. It was literally the only hope he had left. But, now the doubts were starting to gather.
  
 
  
"Gloria's a little more special than the average person," Dara replied. "There's a little bit of universal knowledge inside everyone. Things they know from the moment they're born, even if they don't know what they know. And Gloria...," she nodded at the green-haired waitress serving an elderly couple. "...ALL versions of her on any Earth, have quite a bit of that subconscious knowledge," Dara shrugged. "I just reminded her of something she already knew."
  
 
  
"Wait...," Ruben still hadn't touched his food. Though, Dara was sipping the float. Her explanation vaguely made sense to him; but, a new thought began growing once he accepted that he would see his family again. "... you said this situation happens a lot, right?" he asked. She nodded.
  
 
  
"So, what about the ones that do make it to another planet? How many Earths out there have visited, or even colonized other planets?" Even if it was another Earth, it was still Earth. He wanted to see new planets.
  
 
  
"Oh, none," Dara replied.
  
 
  
"What do you mean, 'none'?" he asked. Dara sat up straighter and looked into his eyes.
  
 
  
"There are no other planets, in any universe. Just Earth," she replied.
  
 
  
"But...," Ruben shook his head. He wanted to argue against it. But, deep down inside he felt that she was right. In his soul, he knew the truth. He had no questions left and instead reached for his burger.
