\[Flourishing Kindness\]

"Are you okay?" A teen with short, rose-red hair surprised Shandra with the question. She sat in the park with her arms around her legs and crying into her knees. Shandra wasn't sad about anything in particular right at that moment; but, she did not know what else to do with her emotions. She was utterly lost and defeated and most definitely not okay. It was the first time a stranger asked, and she wasn't alone. Another teen with longer, dark hair stood next to the first teen; they were both smiling.
  
 
  
"I'm fine," Shandra managed a faint nod. They seemed happy and she didn't want to bother them with her problems. She hadn't been prepared when the first question came but now she let her eyes glance up to the empty space above their heads after her answer.
  
 
  
\[Doubt. (+41)\] appeared over the redhead. And Shandra was genuinely surprised. Not so much that they doubted her; they found her crying alone in the middle of the day on the ground in the middle of a park. But, the "41" displayed in gold numbers. It was the first time she'd seen any other color than red. Her emotion was still in red text the way the messages always were. Even more surprising was the text over the dark-haired teen.
  
 
  
\[Doubt. (+35)\] The number 35 was also in gold. She didn't know what it meant, but at least she knew it wasn't a maximum. She'd never seen anyone's numbers go that high though. She'd seen at most a '25' but those emotions were extremely obvious situations that she didn't need her abilities for.
  
 
  
"My name's Rosario, this is my friend Pyxis," the red-headed teen introduced herself and offered a handshake.
  
 
  
"Shandra," she made an effort to shake Rosario's hand once.
  
 
  
\[Kindness. (+41)\] appeared over Rosario's head as she knelt to meet Shandra's eyes. "We're waiting for some other friends to come by, do you mind if we wait with you?" she asked.
  
 
  
"It's a big park...," Shandra shook her head. If she didn't see it written out for her as clear as day, she might have misinterpreted their kindness. It was easy to be cynical and think that everyone was after something. It was much easier to accept kindness that someone else was only doing out of selfishness; but, these girls were different. Rosario was sincere, pure kindness. Shandra knew she didn't deserve that kind of treatment. "...I'd prefer it if you wait somewhere else," she said.
  
 
  
"Oh," Rosario replied.
  
 
  
\[Determination. (+41)\] appeared over her head.
  
 
  
\[Amusement. (+35)\] appeared above Pyxis as she giggled.
  
 
  
"I'm sorry to be nosy about this, but the thing is, I think we know what's wrong with you. We can help," Rosario said. "Do you want to talk about it?"
  
 
  
"You wouldn't understand," Shandra shook her head.
  
 
  
\[Compassion. (+41)\] appeared over Rosario.
  
 
  
\[Compassion. (+35)\] above Pyxis.
  
 
  
"We're two of the people most likely to understand," Rosario said. Then, she raised her hand and waved it around in the space where Shandra always saw the words. "Your favorite number is 28. I don't know what you see, but I'm sure you see something. We can help you learn about that and more; there are so many things in the multiverse that you've never imagined."
  
 
  
"Really?" Shandra asked out of habit. It sounded like a rhetorical question; but, thanks to her ability it was a good indicator of intent. The fact that they knew her favorite number was surprising. It stood out as a strange thing to mention and made her think about the tattoo she got recently for her 28th birthday. She'd lived a fairly normal life until then, but she was only now just realizing she started seeing the text once she got the tattoo.
  
 
  
\[Honesty. (+41)\]
  
 
  
\[Honesty. (+35)\] the same golden numbers appeared again. Shandra tilted her head at them.
  
 
  
"You know my favorite number. What's yours?" she asked.
  
 
  
"41," Rosario answered.
  
 
  
"35," Pyxis answered. It couldn't be a coincidence. Shandra made a quick decision so she wouldn't have time to change her mind. She reached her hand up towards Rosario.
  
 
  
"Maybe you can help me...," she said. Rosario and Pyxis grabbed her hand and helped her up. Both of them smiled broadly at her, so much so that she didn't need to check what their text said.  "...thank you," she added as she followed them.
