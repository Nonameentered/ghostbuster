"Thank you for seeing me, Mr. Trooper," the pale, dark-haired woman in a crisp white suit greeted the hero as she sat down across from him. Mr. Arnold Trooper was one of the richest, and most famous people in the world; and, his office reflected that. It was a spacious, suite-sized office on the top floor of one of his hotels. He owned several dozen hotels in different countries and each one had the same gaudy, gold-loaded decor. Golden picture frames displayed his art collection, and the floor was made of golden tiles. Her assistant wore a black suit that matched her own white one.
  
 
  
"Please, call me, Arnold," he smiled at her. "So, what can I do for you, Ms. Sharp? May I call you Dana?"
  
 
  
"No," she answered. Then, she continued without missing a beat. "I made time to have this meeting and offer you a position with my company, Sharp Development."
  
 
  
"Excuse me?" Arnold chuckled. He spread his arms to gesture at the lavishness around them, including the ferns in golden pots. "I have my own successful company, Trooper. I make billions a year. What makes you think I need a job from a company I've never heard of?"
  
 
  
"Mr. Trooper, I know you're quick enough to keep up. But, try to pay closer attention to what I say; not your interpretation of it. If I thought you needed this job, you would have it already. I merely came to make you the offer out of courtesy. You haven't heard of Sharp Development because my company is not native to this Earth."
  
 
  
"This Earth?" Arnold sat up straighter. "There are others?" When he first manifested his power, he had an innate sense that he wasn't alone. He knew there would be others and made himself publicly known. It hadn't worked out the way he planned. Years later he was still the only Super that had gone public and he was richer than he could have imagined. But, as soon as Ms. Sharp mentioned the possibility of other Earths, Arnold felt that same stirring in his soul. He knew he wasn't alone.
  
 
  
"There are an infinite number of Earths," Ms. Sharp nodded. "Sharp Development owns millions of those Earths and has a presence on billions. It's only recently that we've taken an interest in your Earth."
  
 
  
"What...," Arnold hesitated. As mind-boggling impractical as that claim sounded, belief came easy to him. But, it was more than that; it was almost a knowing. He was sure of a few things in his life. Any day he woke up was a good day and two plus two equals four. And now, as clear as that knowledge was, he was sure, deep in his soul, that Sharp Development ran the multiverse. "...what are you offering exactly?" he asked. "What does being part of your company do for this Earth?"
  
 
  
"If you join, this Earth would gain access to our trade and tourism. Any product you could imagine from any Earth at an affordable price. And, of course, everyone is welcome to visit any of our other Earths. You're already the most famous person on this Earth. By joining Sharp Development, you would be its savior."
  
 
  
"Why me?" Arnold asked. He believed every word she was saying, but it still sounded too good to be true. There had to be a catch somewhere. He just had to pay careful attention and hope she slipped up somewhere. "You said it yourself, I'm already so well-known. Why not give this honor to someone else?"
  
 
  
"There is a reason for that," Ms. Sharp nodded. "Unfortunately, I'm quite busy and there's not enough time to explain the nuances of how the multiverse functions. But, I think you're clever enough to make do with an abbreviated version. For the sake of analogy let's assign each alternate Earth a value of one point in a game."
  
 
  
"Okay...," Arnold nodded. Though, he was unsure of where the analogy was going.
  
 
  
"There are several options available for the players to earn that point, each with different effects. By default, the point is owned by the people born on that Earth. That is until they start electing officials or Unique Souls are born."
  
 
  
"What's a Unique Soul?" Arnold asked.
  
 
  
"You are," Ms. Sharp replied. "You are Unique Soul #34, El Soldado. All your self-healing, physical abilities, and mental acuity come from that. Once a Unique Soul is born on an Earth, the highest-ranking Unique born on that Earth is given ownership of 'the point' for that Earth. They are then free to go to conquer other Earths and earn more points. So, to answer your question, Mr. Trooper. I am making this offer to you because for the moment, you own this Earth, so to speak. If you join Sharp Development, then I own this Earth. You give your citizens long, happy lives and you get all the credit."
  
 
  
"Wait...," Arnold had a sudden insight. He already built one successful company. "You said that I can go and conquer other Earths too? For myself and my Earth, I mean, not for your company?" He was a smart man, and now he knew there was a simple way to cross to alternate realities. He was rich enough to get the smartest minds on the planet to work on it.
  
 
  
"I suppose," Ms. Sharp nodded. "However, I wouldn't recommend that. It's a dangerous multiverse out there if you don't understand how things work." Arnold grinned to himself. She probably gave him more information than she meant to. But, if she could manage it, then so could he.
  
 
  
"What's the matter, Ms. Sharp?" Arnold chuckled. "Afraid of a little competition?" Ms. Sharp sighed and stood from her seat. Her silent assistant stood with her. "Hey, so what do I do with the points once I get them?" he asked.
  
 
  
A tall black portal opened behind her as she focused on him. Arnold paid close attention because he guessed it related to traveling between universes somehow. But, he hadn't seen either of them so much as press a button.
  
 
  
"Mr. Trooper, that was a simplified analogy for you," she looked down at him. "Obviously, the game as a whole is too complicated for the pieces to understand. And no," she shook her head lightly. "I'm not afraid of a little competition," she said. "I simply don't tolerate it." Then, she added, "It's a shame you couldn't be your people's savior."
  
 
  
The black portal floated forward and swallowed her; then, it disappeared. But, the assistant was still in Arnold's office. He looked at her with confusion and her hands were glowing with bright blue light.
  
 
  
"Wait, what's going on?" he asked. She smiled at him, but shook her head. A black portal opened behind her too and a bright blue flash pulsed from her hands. Arnold felt a rush of heat and saw blue plasma shoot out of her hands at the ground. It melted through to the lower floors like they weren't even there.
  
 
  
"If you didn't listen, I'm not going to tell you."
