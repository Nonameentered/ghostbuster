\[Curses. Monday.\]

Arnold walked out of the back room and paused. The pale, rainbow-haired teen was still standing at the counter. She looked up and smiled at him when she noticed.
  
 
  
"Did you get lost back there?" she giggled.
  
 
  
"You're still here?" Arnold approached the counter from behind and stood in front of her on the other side.
  
 
  
"Yeah," she nodded at the black bonnet sitting atop the display case. "I told you I wanted to buy it," she said.
  
 
  
"But, it's cursed...," Arnold said. He'd already explained that to her. As well as his story about being too old and set in his ways. As far as she knew, he wasn't interested in getting with the times and setting up security cameras. He'd gone into great detail about how he had an occasional theft here and there; he tended to overlook them because he trusted people. He'd had plenty of opportunities to practice his delivery and it never failed him before. After giving prospective clients all the information they needed, he tended to suddenly remember something in the back.
  
 
  
The truth was he did have security cameras. But, he never used them for any prosecution. He enjoyed watching people struggle with themselves before giving in and taking whatever cursed item enthralled them. He'd given the teen a full five minutes.
  
 
  
"Only if you don't know how to use it," she shrugged. "How much?"
  
 
  
Arnold was thankful for the question. Most of his items were on shelves and neatly labeled with unreasonable prices to further encourage theft. She'd pulled the bonnet out of an unlabeled bin that Arnold hadn't completely sorted through yet. He had no idea what the bonnet even did. He only knew if it ended up in his shop, it was cursed.
  
 
  
"It's 300 million," Arnold managed to answer with a straight face. "There's no way you'll ever afford it...," he added with a softer, sadder tone. He wanted her to long for it. "Oh, oops, I'll be right back," he said and immediately spun around to head to the back. This time he went straight to the security monitor and watched.
  
 
  
The teen girl giggled to herself, then she crossed her arms to wait. Her head did not swivel left and right to check for witnesses. She did not attempt to walk away from the item like so many others had, just to return and snatch it. She simply stood there. Arnold quickly realized that another five minutes would be a waste and he returned to the counter.
  
 
  
"Everything okay?" she asked. She presented a clear, glassy card. "I'm ready to pay. Can we do that before you disappear again?" she asked. Arnold shook his head. He had no choice but to be honest with her now.
  
 
  
"I don't have a register," he said. He spread his arms to show the barren glass top counter. The black bonnet was the only thing there. "Cursed items can't be sold," he said.
  
 
  
"Then why'd you open a shop?" she giggled.
  
 
  
"To get rid of them!" Arnold answered. It wasn't her business, and she wouldn't care. But, at the very least, he finally found someone he could vent to. She obviously wasn't going to buy anything anyway.
  
 
  
"I made some mistakes when I was younger...," he sighed. "I ended up cursed to attract curses." He gestured at the bin she pulled the bonnet from. "I can't get rid of the box, it's there every morning and new items are added every month or so. I can't sell them, that only makes the curse worse on me. But, I found out that if the items are stolen, then I can be rid of them. I've made some progress and if people keep stealing, I might be able to finish everything before new ones appear. My only hope is that the curse breaks when I run out."
  
 
  
"Oooohh," the teen nodded. "So, there's nothing in the back, huh?" she asked with a smirk. Arnold chuckled and shook his head.
  
 
  
"My name's Monday," she said. She stretched her pale hand across the counter and Arnold shook it.
  
 
  
"Arnold," he said.
  
 
  
"I can help you be rid of that curse; if you're interested," she said. Arnold didn't waste any time doubting. He'd abandoned his dreams of a nice witch or someone that would take pity on him and break the curse; but, he was instantly interested.
  
 
  
"YES!" he nodded. "Please...," The fact that she seemed immune to the thrall that prompted others to steal from him made it easy for him to believe she was capable. "How... what do I have to do?"
  
 
  
Monday placed a red, translucent clipboard on the table. It was loaded with a white form and red printed text. A header at the top of the sheet showed a pair of red scissors pointing downward and the name 'Sharp Development' in bold.
  
 
  
"Sharp Development is willing to safeguard your soul from any and all past, present, and future curses and other soul-bound entanglements. Just sign here," she pointed at the red line at the bottom of the shit. "And, grant Sharp Development ownership of your soul."
  
 
  
Arnold was ready to sign but he paused.
  
 
  
"My... soul?" he asked. Monday nodded with a bright grin; but, then she looked down.
  
 
  
"Oh, and the bonnet too."
