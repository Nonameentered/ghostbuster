\[Devil's Hunger\]

"That's far enough, Tornado Bob," The Groundskeeper arrived just in time to put himself between an innocent civilian and the villain. A localized forest of thick, redwood trees sprouted up around the businessman to protect him from the high winds and debris. Most of the civilians fled as soon as Tornado Bob appeared; but, he'd still found a target. A portly, bald man that was already out of breath.
  
 
  
"Thank you," he wheezed at the Groundskeeper. The hero in overalls and sunhat nodded with his back to the civilian; he did not want to take his eyes off Tornado Bob. The villain looked like he lived through a tornado every day; he had wild, wind-mussed hair and a bushy black beard that caught all kinds of dirt and particles. He wore a loose t-shirt, Bermuda shorts, and a pair of rollerblades.
  
 
  
"He's still alive...," Tornado Bob shook his head. "I can go further," he chuckled. "Quit ruining my fun and get lost," he added. He made a quick motion upward with both of his arms as if he was lifting something. A sharp gust of wind launched The Groundskeeper into the air. But, he spotted the villain's intentions and was able to react. Several green vines shot out of the ground and wrapped around his feet to catch him before he went very far.
  
 
  
He took his eyes off the ground for a moment as he spun, before he caught himself. Then, he spotted a newcomer as he sank back down to the ground. He was a tall, muscular man in a pink t-shirt and blue jeans.
  
 
  
"Can't take me on alone, Bob?" The Groundskeeper chuckled. Tornado Bob shrugged as he eyed the newcomer.
  
 
  
"I didn't invite this guy," he said. The stranger ignored both of them and headed toward the civilian that hadn't been brave enough to run away yet.
  
 
  
"Hey, who are you?" The Groundskeeper asked. Several vines popped out of the ground to wrap around his feet; but, he kept moving and tore through the vines as if they weren't there.
  
 
  
"I'm talking to you!" The Groundskeeper raised his voice and another redwood shot up to block him. The stranger swatted the giant tree down with a backhanded slap and continued forward.
  
 
  
"HELP!!!" the civilian shouted.
  
 
  
"STOP!!" The Groundskeeper's voice echoed around them. Dozens of sharp, rocky shards shot out of the ground at an angle to form a barricade around the stranger. He stopped and finally turned to look at The Groundskeeper.
  
 
  
"Yeah?" he asked. The Groundskeeper realized he'd taken his attention off Tornado Bob and he quickly turned to check on the villain. He was still there with an interested grin on his face; he wanted to see how this would play out. The Groundskeeper turned his attention back to the stranger.
  
 
  
"Who are you? What do you want with that man?" he asked.
  
 
  
"I'm Roy," he said. Then, he shrugged. "I'm gonna take him to my Mistress," he added. "Don't worry, I'll come back for you two in a bit," he said.
  
 
  
"Mistress?" Tornado Bob asked. He skated closer to participate in the conversation. "Who's she? What does she want with him... with us?" he asked. "Is she pretty?" Roy chuckled.
  
 
  
"Mistress Diavola is the most beautiful woman I've ever seen," Roy said. "She's going to eat him, and likely both of you," he added. His smug smile remained on his face.
  
 
  
"Bob...," The Groundskeeper took a careful step back, closer to Tornado Bob.  He dropped his voice to a whisper. "...He's powerful. I think we need to work together on this."
  
 
  
"Screw that," the villain laughed. "The name's TORNADO Bob, and I'm blowing this joint." The wind picked up and he hovered off the ground, ready to fly away. But, a black portal next to Roy and drew Bob's attention.
  
 
  
"Roy! I'm starving!" she said. Bob sank back down to the ground once he laid eyes on her. She was a short, shapely woman with long golden hair. Her skin was a light shade of pink from what he could see; and, he could see almost everything. She wore a sheer black gown. 
  
 
  
"Forgive me, Mistress," Roy knelt. "I was distracted for a moment." The woman looked around and spotted The Groundskeeper and Tornado Bob. Independently, but simultaneously, they both felt the need to show there was more to them than a normal human. The Groundskeeper coated his fists and forearms in solid stone and Tornado Bob produced a small, palm-sized tornado in his hand.
  
 
  
"Supers!" she giggled. "You're forgiven, Roy," she said. She gestured at the black portal. "I'll take over here," she said.
  
 
  
"Yes, Mistress," Roy bowed his head, then he stood and walked through the portal.
  
 
  
"Hey, gorgeous," Tornado Bob took a chance and skated closer to her. "I'm Tornado Bob," he grinned. "What's your name?"
  
 
  
"Diavola," she smiled. A red glow bloomed in her eyes for a moment before it dissipated. "But, both of you may call me Mistress," she added.
  
 
  
"Yes, Mistress," The Groundskeeper and Tornado Bob replied as one.
  
 
  
"Good. Now, I'm still hungry. Bring that one to me," she said. She pointed at the cowering businessman.
  
 
  
"Yes, Mistress," the pair of Supers replied again. They were no longer counterparts, they were on the same side now. They turned their attention on the civilian; the Mistress' enemy, and her meal.
