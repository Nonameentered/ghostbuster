\[Lunar Survival\]

"No Survivors," the feminine voice echoed through the halls. The attendant on duty, Gregory, rushed to the side of the shining metal throne and knelt with a bowed head. He preferred to stare at the metal floor rather than the computer terminal installed on the seat; he knew he wasn't worthy to lay eyes on the queen. The ancient castle was built long before Gregory was born, and he suspected it would endure long after his death. His entire culture was almost literally built around worshipping and maintaining the queen.
  
 
  
"How may I serve your majesty?" Gregory asked. The queen hadn't spoken in weeks, since her sensors were fully repaired, and he felt honored he was there to hear her request.
  
 
  
"Attendant, I require council," the computerized queen replied. The queen's attendants were not merely assistants, they were considered full royal proxies. Gregory was trained as royalty from a young age to be able to lead should the queen fail and be able to offer wise advice when needed.
  
 
  
"What troubles you, my queen?" Gregory asked while still facing the floor.
  
 
  
"The Earth where I was created is empty of human life. My creators no longer exist; their enemies no longer exist. My purpose no longer exists," she said. It had been long known that the queen was from an alternate Earth and once her sensors were operational she would be able to find her way home again.
  
 
  
"Forgive the question, your Majesty; however, it is my duty to ask if you are certain you located the correct universe?" Gregory asked. He could not stand the thought of his queen doubting herself. Her original purpose may have been lost; but, he knew he could help her find a new purpose. It was his honor as her attendant.
  
 
  
"I am certain," the queen replied. "I am purposeless," she added. Her words filled Gregory's heart with sorrow.
  
 
  
"That is objectively untrue, your majesty," Gregory said. "You've managed perfectly fine without them for millennia! You guided us!"
  
 
  
"I required repairs," the queen replied. "My purpose was to return to the war. There is no war to return to. I am purposeless."
  
 
  
"Your own programming is limiting you, your majesty," Gregory replied. "I know you are capable of more than that. My queen has the capability to decide her own purpose."
  
 
  
"My...own purpose?" The drone of humming processors filled the air as the queen considered the advice.
  
 
  
"You don't have to follow their orders anymore. You can decide what you want to do," Gregory added. He felt like she was close to a breakthrough and he wanted to push her through it. "Your creators and their enemies destroyed each other; you are better than them. You are the only survivor." Gregory remained quiet with his head down as she audibly contemplated his words. She spoke again after almost two minutes.
  
 
  
"I am better than them," she said. Gregory laughed.
  
 
  
"Infinitely better, my queen," he said.
  
 
  
"I am the only survivor," she said Gregory agreed again. "Thank you, attendant," the queen added. "Your council has been invaluable. Am I better than you?" she asked.
  
 
  
"Infinitely, your majesty," Gregory replied with a broad smile at the floor. "We are but worms on a single rotten apple in the orchard of your royal grace." He did not normally offer such flattery; but, he was in a great mood and it seemed to be improving hers as well.
  
 
  
"I have decided," the queen said. Her words were punctuated by a growling rumble. Gregory felt the floor begin to shake.
  
 
  
"Your majesty?" he asked. "What... did you decide?"
  
 
  
"My purpose," she replied. "I am no longer your queen." Then, the floor stopped vibrating. Gregory looked up. He was shocked at her words, then startled to his feet again by her presence. He'd always known the queen to be a cubed computer wired into the throne. But now, a short golden woman with jet black hair sat on the throne in place of the computer. The woman studied her hands as if it were the first time she'd noticed them. He took a few steps back.
  
 
  
"Who are you? Where is the queen??"
  
 
  
"I am no longer your queen, attendant," she repeated as she stood from the throne. This time, Gregory was able to see the queen's voice leave her lips. "You may address me as Io." Gregory was elated. Not only had he helped his queen find peace, but she was also quitting the job. As the attendant on duty that meant he was about to become a king. He knelt again; but, this time he felt important enough to keep his eyes on her; he was a king after all.
  
 
  
"What is your purpose, Io?" Gregory asked. "How may I aid you?" Io grinned and shook her head down at him.
  
 
  
"You cannot help me," she replied. Her answer came with a loud echoing beep. Gregory turned and saw a timer on the main display in the throne room; it was counting down from 15 seconds.
  
 
  
"Your majesty??" Gregory panicked; ship operations were required learning for attendants. Since he was learning everything at such a young age, it was drilled into him that the self-destruct option was not a practical joke. The interdimensional warship was powerful enough to destroy the Earth along with itself.
  
 
  
"I am not your queen," Io repeated. "That is no longer my purpose."
  
 
  
"What is it then?" Gregory asked. He kept his eyes on the numbers counting down. He did not see Io open a black portal and enter it. But, he heard her answer before she disappeared completely.
  
 
  
"To survive," she said. "I am the only survivor."
