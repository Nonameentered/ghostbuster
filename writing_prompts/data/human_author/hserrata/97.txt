\[Surprising Justice\]

"Wait...," Owen stopped in his tracks and stared at his pink-haired date, Justice. Her ponytail wobbled as she turned and saw him pulling a $20 bill out of the trash can; he was lucky that it landed on top of an empty cup. "... did you mean to throw this away?" he asked. She seemed eager to get rid of it as soon as it was given to her along with the burger basket. She tossed it in the first garbage can on their way to a table.
  
 
  
"Oh, I"m sorry, I didn't think," she blushed with faint embarrassment. "Did you want it?" Owen was equal parts offended and confused. He held on to the bill intending to give it back to her, or maybe keep it, and moved to a table to sit down. Once she sat in front of him, he started his questions.
  
 
  
"Why don't you?" he asked. He placed the bill on the table between them and began picking at his fries. Justice shrugged.
  
 
  
"It's not worth anything where I'm from," she said. Then, she corrected herself. "I mean, not worth the effort."
  
 
  
"You said you were from California...," Owen replied. This was only their first date but they spent the previous evening texting and learning a little bit about each other.
  
 
  
"It's a little more complicated than that," she said. "But, I wanted to tell you about it in person."
  
 
  
"So, you lied to me already?" he asked. He stopped munching on the fries altogether. "How much more complicated can it be, either you were born in California or you weren't."
  
 
  
"Well, that's why I wanted to explain it in person, silly," Justice smiled. Despite his accusations, she still seemed in a playful mood.
  
 
  
"I was born in California," she said. "Just not the California on this Earth; I"m from an alternate universe." Owen sighed. Of course, only a crazy woman would go out with him. But, he was very attracted to her. He knew he did not know everything about the world and, he was getting a little bit desperate. His last date had been over two years ago.
  
 
  
"I'm assuming you can prove it somehow...," Owen said.
  
 
  
"Of course," she nodded. "Do you want proof now, or can I finish eating first?" If Owen had paid for her meal he might have assumed she was using him. But, at the moment, she had nothing to gain except his company for a few more minutes. He wasn't going to complain.
  
 
  
"Go ahead," he said. He made an effort to eat a fry to encourage her; but, his appetite was gone. Luckily, she took a big bite out of the burger.
  
 
  
"So, explain to me, why this isn't worth anything on 'your Earth'?" He tried hard to keep the sarcasm out of his voice; but, he wasn't sure he accomplished it. Justice didn't seem to notice either way. "I mean, between bites, of course," he added. He took a sip of his soda as he waited for her to finish chewing.
  
 
  
It was evening and the food truck park was next to the beach. Half a dozen food trucks parked in a line next to the boardwalk. The sun was halfway into the horizon and plenty of pedestrians walked by them. Owen also noted that she didn't seem concerned about keeping her origin a secret when she told him.
  
 
  
"Exchange rates," she replied once she swallowed the bite. "You have them on this Earth, it's the same thing from Earth to Earth. Money from here isn't worth nearly as much as money from my Earth."
  
 
  
"Wait...from Earth to Earth... how many Earths are there?"  Justice shrugged.
  
 
  
"The word 'infinite' gets tossed around. Obviously, not all of them are accounted for. But there are hundreds of millions that have their prices set." She took another big bite while Owen processed the information.
  
 
  
"Infinite...?" he asked in awe. Justice nodded while she chewed. "Hundreds of millions of Earths...," he said. He was having a difficult time wrapping his mind around it. "Wait... the prices are set? By who?"
  
 
  
"Sharp Development," she replied, then quickly took another bite. As she chewed again she reached into the pocket of her white coat and then slid a business card across the table to him. Owen picked up the white card. It had red text on it as well as a logo that looked like a pair of open scissors pointing downward. It read: Sharp Development at the top with her name in the center in golden letters. "Justice Knight."
  
 
  
"You work for the company that sets the exchange rates between Earths?" he asked. Justice nodded and shrugged as she finished her latest bite. Then, she answered.
  
 
  
"It's a huge company with different departments. I don't do any of the finance stuff; I'm a teacher," she said. With that explanation, she shoved the last bit of burger into her mouth. It was larger than her previous bites and it made her cheeks bulge while she chewed it.
  
 
  
"You teach at a school in a different universe?" Owen asked. Justice nodded. "What are you doing here?" he asked. "Is it that easy to get between universes? How did we talk last night?" She reached into her pocket again and pulled out a transparent glass card. Owen watched her tap the card as she chewed and it lit up like a smartphone. He could see through it from behind and saw her swiping through different pages and icons. Then, she placed it on the table and slid it to him. He picked it up and saw their texts from the night before.
  
 
  
Even if she was lying about everything else, Owen had to be impressed with the technology he was looking at. He flipped the card over several times to check the back as he ran his finger up and down the front to scroll. The movements matched up perfectly.
  
 
  
"That's called a node," she said as she washed away the last of her burger with a sip of soda. "It lets me talk and text to other Earths. You didn't touch your burger... are you ready for some proof?" she asked.
  
 
  
"Yeah...," Owen nodded and returned the node to her. She stood up and grabbed him by the arm to encourage him to do the same.
  
 
  
"Then, c'mon," she said. Owen was too confused to be concerned when she led him past the food trucks and into a dim alley between two other restaurants.
  
 
  
"Moving between Earths is called Traversing, and this is how we Traverse," she said. She held up the node with both hands, then pulled her right hand away. Owen had no idea where it came from but she seemed to pull a pitch black card out of the transparent node. She threw the card against the restaurant's brick wall and it opened a tall black hole. "It just takes a portal,' she said. She grabbed his hand again and led him through the portal.
  
 
  
If it weren't strange enough that they walked into a wall, the new location would have definitely convinced him. They stood on a beach beneath a purple sky. The ocean water was crystal clear and he could see several families of merpeople playing.
  
 
  
"Anything else I should know?" Owen asked. He was still trying to sort his mind but if nothing else he believed her now.
  
 
  
"Oh yeah," Justice nodded. "I guess now's a good time to mention it. I'm a werewolf."
