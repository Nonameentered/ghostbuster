Spontaneous Sentience is a known occurrence in the AlterNet. It's been known to happen in [A.I.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/lejtut/wp_you_monitor_a_super_computer_that_is/), [nodes](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/e55rna/wp_ted_woke_up_made_a_coffee_just_like_any_other/), and of course [random NPCs](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/weh35o/wp_tell_me_something_i_dont_know_said_the/). It used to be rare enough to send out a mod [to fix](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/clgyaw/wp_your_life_is_normal_but_when_the_new_students/) the issue. Although, it does [happen to princesses](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/mry4ym/wp_you_saved_the_princess_while_travelling_back/) more [often than most](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/ng6mj7/wp_youre_a_princesses_kidnapped_and_locked_away/). Some players [play through it](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/xdu5pt/wp_when_a_hero_is_chosen_they_are_bonded_to_a/); [some players send a support ticket.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/xlyg3y/wp_a_teen_supernatural_drama_where_the_main/)
