\[Turbo Incompatibility\]

Turbo exited the black portal and took in his new surroundings. He stood on an empty city sidewalk in the middle of the day. Cars could be seen in the distance; but, it looked like he landed in the quiet area of town. A white warehouse building sat in front of him with no windows and only a single door.
  
 
  
He looked down at the black metal bracelet he held in his hand. The number '42' was etched on one side of it in red; but, he was focused on something else. He lifted the bracelet towards the building and a tiny golden arrow started to glow.
  
 
  
"I guess this is the place...," Turbo nodded to himself then he approached the door. It was white-frosted glass and a bold, angular font announced the name of the business: 'Rad Enterprises'. "Huh..," Turbo chuckled curiously at the name, then he pulled open the door. It was heavier than he expected and he studied it closer as he adjusted his grip. The glass front was entirely frosted but the metal frame of the door was made from the same black metal as the bracelet. "...that's definitely not a coincidence...," Turbo mumbled to himself as he walked into the building. The inside of the warehouse was spacious and empty. Smooth white walls surrounded the glossy white floor and ceiling.
  
 
  
"Okay, what now?" Turbo asked the bracelet. The golden arrow flashed again; but, this time a matching golden circle appeared on the ground. "Easy enough...," Turbo knelt and placed the black bracelet in the circle. As soon as he let go, the floor seemed to rush over the bracelet. White dust-sized nanos enveloped the metal bangle. Then, the floor changed. Lush, green grass sprouted out of the smooth white ground. It radiated outward from the bracelet like a green ripple. 
  
 
  
"Mr. Rad!" a surprised voice spoke up behind Turbo. He turned and found a small group of strangers with large smiles. They all wore white lab coats with name tags. 
  
 
  
"We're honored by your visit, sir," a young woman with dark hair spoke up as the group gathered around her. "The lab is in working order and all our personal requests have been filled for now. Is there something we can do for you?" 
  
 
  
"You know me?" Turbo asked. The group nodded as one, then the same woman answered. 
  
 
  
"This is your lab, Mr. Rad. You built it, then you created us to oversee it in your absence. You're essentially our god." 
  
 
  
"Well, Gladys…," Turbo sighed as he glanced at her name tag. "...I'm sorry to say I don't remember any of that." 
  
 
  
"You don't?" she had a note of concern in her voice. But it only lasted for a moment. She broke free of the group and approached the spot where Turbo put the bracelet. "Chronos," she said. A swarm of white particles rose into the air from the ground. They coalesced into a vague humanoid form. 
  
 
  
"Yes, Gladys, how can I help you?" Chronos replied with a smooth, mechanical voice. 
  
 
  
"Mr. Rad lost his memory. Will you do a quick sweep of the timeline to see if anything is different?" the white mannequin nodded. 
  
 
  
"Anamolous timestream detected," Chronos said instantly. "A recent backup of Turbo’s Soul is available. Would you like me to restore it?”
  
 
  
“I backed up my soul?” Turbo asked. He shook his head to clear through all the confusion. “When was the last backup?” he asked. He seemed comfortable enough to talk to Chronos on his own now. Gladys stepped back while Chronos answered.
  
 
  
“According to Sharp Standard Time, approximately eight months from now, in June.”
  
 
  
“June!?” Turbo was shocked. “Restore it!” he said. He was eager to learn what he already knew. Chronos nodded. Then, after a moment, he shook his head.
  
 
  
 
  
“Incompatible version,” Chronos said. 
  
 
  
“Incompatible version??” Turbo asked. That was the first time he could remember hearing that particular error. “Version of what?? Is the backup corrupted somehow?” 
  
 
  
“The backup is in working order,” Chronos said. “However, it is incompatible with the current version of the universe.”
