\[Surge of Information\]

"Uh, yeah," Surge nodded. Then, he remembered to try and keep it formal. "I mean, yes, your highness. I am the chosen one," he replied. Then, he took his eyes off the throne to glance at his friend. Molly giggled at him but nodded.
  
 
  
"Only you can save my kingdom, hero," the frail, silver-haired king spoke with a gravelly voice. "A great plague has befallen us...," he began to explain the situation, but Surge turned his attention to Molly.
  
 
  
"What's so funny?" he asked.
  
 
  
"Not funny," Molly grinned. "It's just a little amusing," she said. "I remember when I first started learning the AlterNet, I was like that too. I tried to roleplay all the quests at first too, but it gets hard to keep up that effort when you realize the NPCs don't care. This king probably sees a dozen 'Chosen Ones' a day, and he's going to give each of them the exact same speech. The speech that you're not even listening to right now," she giggled again.
  
 
  
"Will you help us, hero?" the king asked.
  
 
  
"Yes, your highness," Surge nodded. When he did, a small line of red text appeared in the top left-hand corner of his view.
  
 
  
\[Quest Accepted\]
  
 
  
"I got it," Surge turned and nodded at Molly.
  
 
  
"Good," she said. "Then, this is where the lessons start. Bring up your Slate." Molly flicked her wrist up at about stomach height and a translucent, grey pane of glass appeared in the air in front of her. Surge copied her and summoned his own Slate.
  
 
  
He could see all the text and menus on his clearly, even though hers was obscured. lt had his character sheet and several buttons to access different screens.
  
 
  
"If we were in the same party when you accepted the quest, and if it was something I could still do, I would get invited to do it automatically," she said.
  
 
  
"Okay," Surge nodded. He couldn't believe how much his life had changed in less than a week. Only a few short [days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/y31mv2/wp_the_one_person_none_of_the_heroes_or_villains/) he was a villain but his entire life changed when he met Molly. And, she was still taking time to teach him the nuances of the AlterNet that weren't covered by Mundo's talk.
  
 
  
"Go to your quest log and find the quest you just accepted. It should be easy, you only have two," she added. Surge found the appropriate menu and found two quests listed in red text on a white background. \[[Gloria's Life](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/rdvg6w/wp_you_work_security_at_an_entry_gate_at_the/)\] was the first one he accepted, and now he had \[Plagued Kingdom\]. He touched it and it brought up the details beneath the entry.
  
 
  
"Got it," he nodded. "Now what?"
  
 
  
"Try to share it with me," she said.
  
 
  
"Okay," Surge found the 'Share' button, then he found Molly's name in his guild list to share it.
  
 
  
\[Error: \[Plauged Kingdom\] Quest is only available to Necromancers.\]  the text appeared on his Slate, and he shook his head at Molly.
  
 
  
"I can't, it's Class locked," he said.
  
 
  
"Oh nuts, I didn't even think about that," Molly sighed. Then, she shrugged. "Oh well, now you learned about Class locked quests. You probably didn't know what it meant yet, but there's an indicator on the quests that'll tell you if it's locked." Surge studied the two entries and found a few different icons that he realized meant different things. One of them was the necromancer class icon.
  
 
  
"Oh, okay," he said. "Thanks."
  
 
  
"The good thing is, I can still help you, even if I can't accept it myself," Molly said. As she spoke, a party invite appeared in Surge's vision.
  
 
  
\[Molly has invited you to join a party.\] He accepted it.
  
 
  
"So, since I can't read the text for myself, what do we have to do?" Molly asked. Then, she giggled. "I know you weren't listening."
  
 
  
"Uhhh...," Surge looked down at his Slate and scanned the text.
  
 
  
"It's a few different steps... I think the easiest to start with is finding bags of diseased grain around the village."
  
 
  
"Then, let's get started," Molly grinned. She turned and started walking out of the throne room with Surge close behind her. "The sooner we get this one done the sooner we can move on to what I wanted to show you about sharing quests."
  
 
  
"We're doing more?" he asked. He wanted to, but he was still surprised.
  
 
  
"Of course," Molly nodded with a laugh. "We're 'chosen ones'," she added with faint sarcasm. "All those prophecies aren't going to fulfill themselves."
