\[Stellar Signal\]

\[I think I'm stuck in an alternate universe. I might be crazy, I don't know. What I do know is I walked out of my living room and into a forest. I turned around and my house was gone. There are webs everywhere and tons of spiders, and I think I saw a [deer give birth to a spider](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/xftsn8/wp_the_universe_is_a_simulation_and_our_world_has/). I didn't stick around to find out. I don't know if anyone can help me, but this isn't a joke. Please help!\]
  
 
  
Eridani submitted her post and decided to move on. She'd found a clearing next to a stream that seemed to be free of the thick cobwebs that covered the forest. She followed the stream for about half an hour, stopping often to check if she still had wifi. Each time she did, she kept moving. She did not want to leave range; but, somehow she still had full bars.
  
 
  
She explored the forest a bit before she checked her phone. She was amazed that she found a connection; but, rustling leaves distracted her. That was when she saw a pregnant deer thrashing on its side as several long, spindly legs began to crawl out of it; Eridani ran. She sent the message when she found the stream, and now, half an hour later, the forest gave way to a lush, hilly plain. She could see some buildings in the distance and felt some relief as she pushed forward.
  
 
  
After a few steps, she heard voices to the side. She turned and looked through the trees and saw a pair of teenage girls headed into the forest some distance away. They were talking to each other and hadn't noticed Eridani yet. They both had dark hair styled differently. One with a short bob wore all white as far as Eridani could see; the other with longer hair in a ponytail wore a mix of black and red; but, she had a black visor covering her eyes.
  
 
  
"HEY!!" Eridani called out and changed direction to intercept them. She hoped they could help her get her bearings, and she wanted to keep them out of the dangerous forest. The pair of teens stopped walking and turned.
  
 
  
"Hi!" the girl in white smiled broadly as Eridani approached. "Are you the one looking for help?" she asked.
  
 
  
"Huh?" Eridani reached them; but, she was puzzled.
  
 
  
"Did you post to fifthworldproblems?" she asked. "About being stuck?"
  
 
  
"I did...," Eridani nodded. But, she took a subconscious step back. "..how did you know?" she asked. "I don't have any replies yet, how did you find me?"
  
 
  
"I'm Dara," the girl in white said. Then, she gestured at her visored friend. "This is Abby. My mom's company is good at finding people lost between universes; it happens a lot," she explained. "And your wifi signal was showing up somewhere around here."
  
 
  
"I've got wifi...," Eridani shook her head. "...but, I don't know where it came from." Dara giggled; Abby remained bored.
  
 
  
"It's yours," she said. "Your house, wherever you came from, you're still connected."
  
 
  
"What?" Eridani whipped out her phone in a hurry. She kicked herself a little for not checking the name of the access point sooner; but, she was too busy being glad she had communication at all. She pulled down the menu and clicked the wifi button. There it was in all its familiar glory: Epsilon-Access. She chose the name because she wanted something unique. But, every other access point in her apartment building was labeled FBIvan, I.P.Freely, and dozens of other variations. "What's going on?" she asked.
  
 
  
"How am I still connected?" she looked around at the rolling hills to one side, and the dim forest on the other. "I'm nowhere near my apartment."
  
 
  
"I'm gonna keep exploring," Abby said suddenly. She was focused on Dara and seemed to ignore Eridani altogether. "Thanks for bringing me along," she added.
  
 
  
"No problem, it was my mom's idea," Dara replied. Abby nodded, then, she walked off into the forest.
  
 
  
"Wait!" Eridani spoke up. "It's dangerous!" honestly, she didn't know that for sure; but, it was definitely the vibe that she sensed. Abby did not turn around, nor stop walking.
  
 
  
"She'll be fine," Dara replied when Eridani was going to try again. "Anyway, you're still connected because you want to be," she continued. "It's kind of a lot to explain, but you're something known as a Unique Soul. You can Traverse between universes by yourself, even if you haven't realized it yet. That same power keeps you connected."
  
 
  
"I can do that?" Eridani asked. "Like, on purpose?"
  
 
  
"That's the best way to do anything," Dara nodded with a gin. Then, she pulled out a small transparent card. It caught the light like glass but Dara pulled out a pitch-black card from it, somehow. Eridani did not see how it happened; Dara held the transparent card in one hand and ran her hand over it with the other and was suddenly holding the black card. Then, she threw the card on the ground and a large black hole opened beneath them. The fact that she appeared to be standing on nothing boggled Eridani's mind a little bit, but Dara interrupted her unease.
  
 
  
"Once you meet Mundo, you'll know about the multiverse and how to use your abilities," Dara said. Then, Eridani felt her stomach drop as they both began sinking into the hole; it reminded her of an elevator.
  
 
  
"You're leaving Abby here?" Eridani asked. She was free to worry about others now that she felt somewhat safe. Dara nodded.
  
 
  
"I'll come back for her in a little while," she said. "There was someone my mom wanted her to meet first."
