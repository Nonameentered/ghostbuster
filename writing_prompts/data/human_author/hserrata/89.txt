"Alright...," President Garza sighed at his guest. A woman with violet hair in a crisp white suit sat across from him. She appeared in his office suddenly and introduced herself as Victoria, much to the surprise of the security detail. After some explanation and demonstrations, she sat down to talk. She claimed she was only there to help them install a magic system.  "...you've made your case. I'll believe Sharp Development is capable of what you're promising for now. I seem to have options," he said. "What are they?"
  
 
  
"There are six magic schools available," Victoria nodded. "You may choose Elemental magic, Healing magic, Nature magic, Rhythm magic, Shadow magic, or Weapon magic. Each school will unlock certain classes for your Earth."
  
 
  
"What do you mean?" President Garza tilted his head at her.
  
 
  
"Enabling magic on your Earth is one thing, but none of the current population is able to use it. If you were to choose Nature magic, for example, Druids and rangers would begin to appear. Rhythm magic would give you bards, and so on," Victoria said. She pulled a translucent red clipboard out of her blazer and slid it across to the President. It was loaded with white pages and the first one had a list of the magic schools as well as what classes they unlocked.
  
 
  
"Oh, I see!" the President grew excited at the possibilities. If he knew what kinds of magic users were to appear, he could search for them and raise an army quicker than any other nation. His top priority was keeping the citizens of his country safe. Victoria seemed to have a way to all but guarantee that. And, if he played his cards right, he could come out ahead on the deal. "Very nice, very nice indeed," he grinned as he looked over the list. Then, he focused on Victoria again.
  
 
  
"Tell me, is there any way to guarantee where the first generation of magic users are born?"
  
 
  
"No," Victoria shook her head. Then, she shrugged. "Not really. Nothing practical anyway," she giggled. "But, I am in somewhat of a hurry. If you could pick something from the list, I'll be on my way."
  
 
  
"Wait," President Garza hadn't realized he was on a time limit. "If you're in a hurry, you may leave to tend to your other business. And, then come back to hear my decision." Victoria smirked.
  
 
  
"Sorry, it's a one-time offer. Use it or lose it."
  
 
  
"You can't be serious," President Garza said. He tried to hold back the anger but he wasn't sure he managed it. He still raised his voice at her. "You show up and offer me the chance to completely change the world; then, you tell me to hurry?" Victoria nodded.
  
 
  
"Either you want to change the world, or you don't. I'm still working, and I have other Earths to make this offer to."
  
 
  
"Okay, what's the impractical method, then?" President Garza asked. He hoped to buy himself a little more time to think. Victoria sighed in obvious, almost exaggerated annoyance.
  
 
  
"Your Earth isn't...," Victoria paused to find the right word. She grinned when she found it. "...advanced enough. Just hurry up and pick from the list."
  
 
  
"No," President Garza stood firm while sitting tall. "If Sharp Development cares about customer service as much as you claim, I have every right to hear all my options."
  
 
  
"You may choose a school of magic to unlock, free of charge. However, you may purchase the option to unlock more, one at a time. If you purchase all six schools, you may choose where the first generation from each school is born."
  
 
  
"How much for each?" President Garza asked. He imagined it would be prohibitively expensive to get the remaining five. But, maybe he could still unlock an extra one or two schools of magic.
  
 
  
"Sharp Development doesn't accept money for purchases this large," Victoria said.
  
 
  
"Then, what?" President Garza asked. He wondered what resources more advanced civilizations had that he didn't. "Energy?"
  
 
  
"In a way," Victoria nodded. "We accept souls, Mr. Garza."
  
 
  
"You want my soul?" he asked. Victoria shook her head.
  
 
  
"A single soul isn't worth a single school," she said. "It's not common knowledge; but, as an elected official, the universe gives you certain rights over the souls of your constituents," she added. "They are placing a great deal of trust in you, after all."
  
 
  
"How many?" President Garza asked. He knew it might be a step too far; but, it wouldn't hurt to hear how unreasonable the number was. Even if he was only considering it for the safety of his nation.
  
 
  
"Five million per school," she said.
  
 
  
"Five million??" President Garza was schocked. It was almost unconscionable.
  
 
  
"Five million random strangers from across your country. You'll still have more than 300 million citizens to keep safe. And it's not like they die immediately," she giggled. "They'll live full, happy lives in a safe, magical country before Sharp Development claims their souls. They'll never have any idea you sold their souls."
  
 
  
"Okay...," \~President Garza nodded. He'd only wanted to hear the offer to get time to think, but he didn't need to think anymore. The solution was obvious. The people that voted for him trusted his judgment and he was using it. "I'll take the deal,"
  
 
  
"Wonderful," Victoria leaned forward and lifted the sheet to point at a line on the second one. "Sign here, please." President Garza sighed as he signed his name.
  
 
  
"Lord forgive me...," he shook his head. "25 million souls...," He finished signing and Victoria giggled again as she took the clipboard back.
  
 
  
"30 million," she corrected him.
  
 
  
"What?" At this point, five million was nothing but it was the principle. "You said I was getting one free!" Victoria shook her head.
  
 
  
"I said you may choose one school for free, or buy all six for the deal," she said. President Garza remembered her wording clearly and hung his head.
  
 
  
"What does Sharp Development do with souls?" he asked. Maybe too late. "What did I damn 30 million souls to?"
  
 
  
"Oh, don't worry about it," Victoria grinned as she stood up and collected the clipboard. "You'll find out."
