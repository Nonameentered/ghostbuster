\[Doctor's Aid\] 

"Are you a Healer?" The stern, green-haired man stared down at the 14-year-old girl in his waiting room.
  
 
  
"No, Sir," she shook her head. He nodded.
  
 
  
"I didn't think so," he said. "Name's Doc Mundo," he offered her his hand and she shook it.
  
 
  
"Call me Vivi," she said.
  
 
  
"Well, Vivi, what are you doing here tonight?" he asked. Vivi tilted her head at him. She was under the impression he knew why she was there when he approached her. But, she decided not to waste time pointing out things he should already know; it was quicker to just answer.
  
 
  
"I brought in that adolescent mermaid...," she answered. "...is she okay?"
  
 
  
"Sorry," Doc Mundo shrugged. "I guess I should clarify why did you bring an NPC to my clinic?" he asked. "You did realize she was an NPC, right?" Vivi nodded sheepishly.
  
 
  
"So many NPCs have been gaining consciousness lately," she shook her head. "I didn't want her to Wake up hurt and alone if it was going to happen." The doctor chuckled.
  
 
  
"Unfortunately, she's the 'wounded mermaid' for a Healer quest; she's always going to be hurting like that," he said.
  
 
  
"Oh...," Vivi nodded.
  
 
  
"But, I feel like you already knew I wouldn't be able to help her," the doctor said. Vivi gave another faint nod. She wasn't very good at lying, even if all she had to do was stay quiet. "And if that's the case, then it was just an excuse to talk to me. So, let me try this again. What are you doing here tonight?" he asked. Vivi had spent most of the evening trying to build her courage up. She still wasn't ready; but, it was now or never.
  
 
  
"I want to be a fae doctor like you!" She blurted it out. "I'll work for free in the office just so I can learn!" Doc Mundo looked down at her for several moments. Vivi managed to stay still and hold his gaze.
  
 
  
"Do you go to school?" he asked.
  
 
  
"Toku-high," she nodded. The doctor glanced at his watch, then he focused on her again.
  
 
  
"Alright, what are you doing tonight?" he asked. The question sounded different than when he asked it before. Vivi hoped she wasn't about to embarrass herself in front of the doctor. 
  
 
  
"Helping you until I have to go home?" she answered with a hopeful question. The doctor chuckled, then he turned to leave the waiting area.
  
 
  
"Good answer," he said. "Come on then."
