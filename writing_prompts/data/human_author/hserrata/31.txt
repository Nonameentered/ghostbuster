Keys is [known to be impatient](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/xgjrus/wp_you_are_a_pretty_average_superhero_who_tends/) when dealing with [newly-conscious NPCs](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/y23g3j/wp_the_princess_ran_away_from_her_home_and_became/). Rather than help the king along, he killed him and then [submitted a ticket](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/xlyg3y/wp_a_teen_supernatural_drama_where_the_main/) to have him replaced immediately instead of waiting for the respawn.
