"Might as well...," Kevin's stomach decided for him. He hadn't had breakfast yet; he usually tries to get his day planned first. On any given morning he has a few words on his mirror predicting his day. Some days were more vague than others and he enjoyed the morning ritual of contemplating the day ahead and trying to fit the prediction into his plans. Though, on this particular day, he did not get any inspiring words to guide him. All he found was a name, Mundo, and an address.
  
 
  
There was no time given, but he made it a point to get there as soon as possible. The address belonged to a bustling diner named Mundo's. Kevin was hungry and he reasoned that any diner with an overflowing parking lot like Mundo's probably served good food. He walked in and immediately found a crowd huddled by the door waiting to be seated.
  
 
  
"Just one?" A hostess in a mint green uniform asked him. Kevin nodded. "Won't be that long of a wait," she said.
  
 
  
"Thank you," Kevin nodded again and wedged himself into a corner by the door. As soon as he found a comfortable spot the door opened again. A pale woman in a navy blue blazer walked in. She had shoulder-length sea-green hair and an aquamarine star tattooed on her cheek with the number 35.
  
 
  
"Hi, Isla. How many today?" the hostess asked. The woman searched the crowd, then pointed to a woman in white with a silver tie seated next to where Kevin stood.
  
 
  
"I'm with her," the woman replied, then she sat between Kevin and the red-skinned woman she pointed out.
  
 
  
"It's never this full..," Isla commented as soon as she sat.
  
 
  
"Make sure Mundo thanks you for that," the other woman said. Kevin tried to listen without being obvious or staring. The woman had deep red skin and it seemed like she had a crown of rubies embedded around her head. "I promised him a full Chroma Corp. ad campaign in exchange for meeting you. I'd say it's paying off," she said. Then, she sat up straighter and gave Isla her full attention. "Why are we meeting? Did you learn anything about Minerva?" she asked.
  
 
  
"Not about Minerva," Isla shook her head. "But, I did learn something concerning."
  
 
  
"What's that?" The red woman asked.
  
 
  
"Minerva is not the only one missing," she said. "While looking into her disappearance I've noticed several other notable Unique Souls are unaccounted for including Regal and Ballisea. And, the reason I thought we should meet; Donna Chang."
  
 
  
"Donna Chang is missing?" the woman asked. Isla nodded.
  
 
  
"I did not check the rest of the Chrome Court, I thought I'd leave that to you," she said.
  
 
  
"Thank you," the woman nodded. At that moment the door opened again and another diner walked in. He arranged a party of four with the hostess and then went back out to wait outside.
  
 
  
"Whatever ads you ran really did the job," Isla commented with a giggle. The red woman shook her head.
  
 
  
"Life is funny sometimes," she said. "In all honesty, Chroma Corp. isn't the company it used to be. I did not have the kind of money we normally put into our advertising. The best I could do was buy a banner ad," she giggled. Isla looked around the crowded restaurant and entrance.
  
 
  
"This is all from a banner ad?" she asked. The red woman nodded.
  
 
  
"Ruby, table for two," the hostess said. The red woman waved at her and she stood with Isla.
  
 
  
"Well, I did advertise in the most popular app on this Earth," Ruby added as they followed the waitress. Kevin was listening in; and, he felt sudden disappointment when he remembered why he was there.
  
 
  
"It's some sort of daily horoscope app," Ruby said. "It tells people how their day is going to go in 10 words or less. I just gave them the address and let curiosity do the rest."
