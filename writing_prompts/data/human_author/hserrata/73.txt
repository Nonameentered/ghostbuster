\[Uniquely Boring\]

"What?" The enchantress stopped advancing and tilted her head at Joe. She was shorter than his 6' height but he'd already seen what she was and what she could do. Though, he was surprised when she walked out of the lake. She was a mermaid with her bottom half covered in black, crystalline fish scales; but, Joe discovered that she could form legs quite easily when she stepped out of the water. Her evil grin dulled into a curious smirk and her mirror-black eyes cleared to reveal intelligent dark grey irises. "Chip?" She turned away from Joe and he followed her gaze.
  
 
  
A tall, burly man in a suit walked out of a black portal that wasn't there moments ago. He knelt next to the enchantress.
  
 
  
"Yes, Mistress Majicka?" he asked.
  
 
  
"Get all the help you want!" Joe shouted from behind his shield. It was a cracked, wooden shield that he found on the lake shore next to a rusted sword. His gun had already proven useless and was now empty. These were the only other weapon he could find and he was determined to make his death costly for them. "I'm sure there's a version of me that can take you all on!" She gestured at Joe but kept her attention on the newcomer, Chip.
  
 
  
"You know how boring it is for me when they're still Slumbering," she said. The large man turned to look at Joe. His eyes glowed with golden stars and Joe wondered if the man had some sort of magic spectacles. He'd already met a mermaid. And Joe could heal any wounds that he received, so magic was definitely on the table.
  
 
  
"He is Awakened," Chip nodded again but he kept his gaze on the ground. Majicka sighed, then turned to Joe.
  
 
  
"You haven't met Mundo, have you?" she asked. Joe shook his head, but every second they talked built his confidence a little more.
  
 
  
"Like I said, call anyone you want," he chuckled. She had already seen his regenerative abilities in action and Joe hoped she was having doubts. But, he'd seen what she could do too. She could manipulate water precisely enough to lash him with liquid whips, and her body seemed to be made of water itself. His shots only made tiny ripples in her body as they went through her. He knew the rusted sword would be useless, but Joe had never been one to give up.
  
 
  
"MUNDO!" Majicka called towards the sky. When she did, Joe felt a pang of severe annoyance course through him. He didn't know where it came from; but, for a brief moment, he was almost ready to give up out of sheer frustration. He felt like nothing had gone his way. He grit his teeth to fight the impulse, and it passed quickly. Then, he saw a portly, green-haired man rise out of the ground.
  
 
  
"What?" he asked. Joe was surprised to hear his tone. Chip had been entirely deferential but Mundo's voice made it clear he was there as a favor to her. Majicka pointed at Joe.
  
 
  
"He needs the talk," she said. Mundo turned and looked Joe up and down. He stroked his green beard while he thought. Joe stood taller and held his shield firm in response. After a moment, Mundo shook his head.
  
 
  
"No thanks," he replied. "I'm not going to waste all that time just so you can eat him. If you're going to kill me, kill me. But, don't bother me again," Mundo replied. At his words, he sank back down into the ground and disappeared.
  
 
  
"Aarrggh!" Majicka growled and another surge of annoyance flashed through Joe. He realized she was the source. Somehow, she could control his emotions, at least for a moment. "Chip, you try," she said.
  
 
  
"Yes, Mistress Majicka," he nodded and rose to his feet. He strode towards Joe with purpose. At his height, Joe often felt he was a tall man; but, Chip was notably taller. He looked up at the spectacled man and held his ground. Whatever was going to happen, he would see it through.
  
 
  
"You are Unique Soul #34," Chip said.
  
 
  
"What?" Joe was surprised. He wasn't attacked as he expected, and more importantly, he mentioned Joe's favorite number. He liked it so much that he got it tattooed on himself. It couldn't have been a coincidence. The strange circumstances allowed him to connect his tattoo to more or less the same time he noticed he could regenerate.
  
 
  
"There is an infinite multiverse," Chip nodded. "But, there is only one of you. Only one Mistress Majicka, and only one of me. We are all Unique Souls."
  
 
  
"What?" Joe asked. How would they know that? That didn't even make sense in the context of infinity. Chip continued.
  
 
  
"When a soul is first created, it's divided into millions of fragments and spread out across the multiverse. Each fragment lives out a life on an alternate Earth. Each lifetime is a separate lesson and each fragment goes through hundreds of lifetimes. Over time the soul pieces are consolidated into a single body. At one point, there were other versions of you; but, now that you're a Unique Soul, that is no longer the case. Once you die, that's the end of your soul."
  
 
  
"That doesn't make any sense," Joe shook his head. "Even if that cycle was true, there has to be another one of me out there. Infinity means all possibilities," he replied. Majicka sighed.
  
 
  
"Chip, find me another meal. This one's boring," she replied, then she turned around to head back to the lake while grumbling aloud. "I can't stomach an idiot who doesn't understand how special he is."
