"They what!?" Turbo did a double-take and focused on the genie. He was surprised; but, Barley's giggle managed to keep him calm. He was testing some universal truths and it was a bad time to let surprise overtake him; he needed to focus. Barley gave him a genie primer before they started but he was caught off guard by how the genie worded his answer. "Explain that please, this isn't a wish," he clarified. He knew aliens weren't real so the genie had to mean something else.
  
 
  
"This country is currently at war with another country. To them, you're the attacking aliens," the genie replied.
  
 
  
"So, you didn't do anything...," he turned to Barley. "That one doesn't count, right?" he asked her. The blonde woman nodded with a grin. Then, he focused on the blue half-man again. "Okay, let's try this, I wish space aliens from a different planet attacked," he said. The genie shook his head.
  
 
  
"No can do," the genie replied. "Space aliens don't exist, genies can't magic things up that don't exist." That was the point of Turbo's entire experiment.
  
 
  
"Perfect," Turbo grinned. "I still have three wishes, then?" he asked. The genie nodded.
  
 
  
"Sharp Development records indicate that you have three wishes remaining, Master Turbo," he said.
  
 
  
"I wish my friend Xap was standing here with us," Turbo said. He left Xap on the other side of the multiverse with instructions to wait. It was a small test to determine how cooperative the genie was going to be.
  
 
  
"Your wish is granted," the genie gave a curt bow as a plume of blue smoke erupted in the air. When it cleared, a teenager with pale green skin stood with them.
  
 
  
"Xap?" Turbo wanted to make sure his friend wasn't affected by the wish. He nodded and neon green lines began to glow around his mouth like jagged triangles resembling teeth. His eyes glowed with the same green energy; then, the glow faded.
  
 
  
"Everything seems okay," he replied to Turbo.
  
 
  
"Hi!" Barley waved at Xap and he returned the greeting.
  
 
  
"Okay, so far so good," Turbo nodded and focused on the genie again. He pulled a translucent red node from his pocket and held it out in front of the genie. "I wish I had the capability and equipment to restore this backup," he said.
  
 
  
"No can do," the genie replied. "That technology doesn't exist anywhere in the multiverse," he said.
  
 
  
"Huh...," Turbo was disappointed; but, not surprised. That answer was why he was using a genie at all; they were the only ones that would know that. "...that's... a little concerning," he chuckled nervously. The backup was apparently made by him at some point in the future; and, he'd already been thinking about the timeline quite a bit thanks to Chronos. This latest wrinkle all but confirmed he was in a different timeline than when the backup was created. He decided the next step was to see how much was different. Unfortunately, the fastest way to do that had its own dangers.
  
 
  
"Thanks for all your help, Barley," he nodded at the blonde woman. "You and Xap should go somewhere else before I make my next wish."
  
 
  
"Good luck to you," Barley nodded as she threw a card on the floor. It opened a black portal on the ground and she jumped in. The portal closed behind her as Xap prepared his own exit.
  
 
  
"See you...," Xap waved and jumped into the portal he created. It closed once he was gone leaving Turbo and the genie alone.
  
 
  
Well, here goes nothing...," Turbo took in a deep breath for confidence. "I wish Ballisea was standing here so I could ask her some questions," he said.
  
 
  
Turbo didn't know exactly who she was; the name was a frequent ghost in his mind. The only thing he knew was that he was afraid of her, whoever she was. He felt like she could help. Something told him she was important, if not integral, to the multiverse as a whole. He thought he was ready for anything; but, he was instantly terrified and worried the moment he made his wish. And, not for any of the reasons he expected. He discovered a much more pressing situation.
  
 
  
"No can do," the genie replied. "That Unique Soul doesn't exist anywhere in the multiverse."
