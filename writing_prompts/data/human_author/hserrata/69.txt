\[Monster by any Other Name\]

"41...," Rosario sat on the bench and wondered about her favorite number. It was the lunch period and she preferred to sit outside in nature instead of in the cafeteria surrounded by noisy students. She found a nice spot next to some rose bushes in the shade of a large tree. She did not know she had a favorite number until a student asked her the previous day. Not only was she surprised by her immediate answer, but she was also surprised when they left her alone.
  
 
  
Rosario had only been attending the school for a week. Though it felt like every day, and sometimes multiple times a day, when a different student asked her to join them. The first time it happened, she thought they wanted to be friends and she was willing to make new friends. She tagged along with a group of three other students; but, she only followed them as far as the edge of the school grounds. It was her first week and she didn't want to get in any trouble by leaving campus.
  
 
  
The group explained that they were on the trail of a monster that stalked the students and they needed her help. It was at that point that she dismissed them as crazy and walked away. But, it happened again the next day. A different group of students seemed interested in being friends with her; but, it did not take long for them to try and lead her off the campus again. They gave the same explanation about a monster. It happened the second time on her second day and after that, she decide to ignore any 'new friends'.
  
 
  
Rosario wasn't the type to make waves. She assumed it was some sort of hazing that took place at the school and decided it was easy enough to not participate. Although, the attempt from the day before stuck with her. When she tried to avoid the conversation altogether one of them asked her favorite number. She answered '41' before she even knew she had one. Her answer seemed to annoy them into leaving her alone. They sighed, called her 'broken', and then walked away. It was the 'broken' part that hurt the most. She was just trying to do the right thing.
  
 
  
As she tried to enjoy the nature around her, she noticed two teen girls heading straight to her. She'd never seen them before; one had long silver hair and the other had dark curls that ended at her shoulders. Rosario could tell they were going to talk to her too; she braced herself mentally.
  
 
  
"Hi," the dark-haired one waved as soon as they were close enough. Both of them smiled at her. "You're the new kid, right? I'm Aurora, this is Emily," she said. "We've got a club that hangs out after school, wanna join us?" Their introduction sounded so scripted now; she'd heard the exact phrase with different names almost a dozen times. She glared at them.
  
 
  
"My favorite number's 41. I'm broken. Leave me alone," she said.
  
 
  
"Oh no," Emily, the silver-haired girl, said as Aurora sighed and shook her head.
  
 
  
"No one's helped you yet? How long has it been?" Aurora asked. Something was different about these two. Rosario heard genuine concern in their voice; and, they were actually asking different questions than she normally got.
  
 
  
"What?" Rosario asked.
  
 
  
"My favorite number is 46," Aurora replied.
  
 
  
"21," Emily added with a smile.
  
 
  
"We're something called 'Unique Souls', you are too. That means a lot of things; but for now, we'll just say it means you notice things other people don't," Aurora explained. "Like, this for example," Aurora flicked her wrist upward and a grey glassy square appeared in front of her. It was wide and flat and it hovered in the air and she began to move her fingers on it like she was typing.
  
 
  
"What's that grey thing?" she asked. Both girls giggled.
  
 
  
"It's called a Slate; think of it like a menu screen in a game," Aurora answered. Then, she finished with it and dismissed it with another flick of her wrist. "You'll get one too once you make your character," she said.
  
 
  
"What... are you talking about?" Rosario grew more confused with each answer they gave; but, they were still the ones that talked to her the most so far. She felt comfortable around them; but, she couldn't pinpoint why.
  
 
  
"It's too much to explain," Aurora shook her head. "It's better to learn as you go. Let's go and we'll fill you in."
  
 
  
"I'm not going anywhere," Rosario shook her head. "Not during school hours," she added. She did want to join them. She did want new friends. But, it still seemed like they were trying to take her somewhere.
  
 
  
"Okay," Aurora glanced at Emily first; then, they both nodded. "We won't rush you. We can just finish the quest while you're waiting out the day."
  
 
  
"What quest?" Aurora asked.
  
 
  
"The one you were supposed to help us with," Aurora answered. "But, since you're Awake, I sent in a support ticket to get the quest fixed." She shrugged and shook her head. "I don't know why people can't be bothered to do that much."
  
 
  
"What are you talking about?" Rosario asked. A week of rejection was starting to wear on her. No matter how comfortable she felt, she couldn't shake the feeling that they were toying with her too, just like everyone else. But, Aurora answered her question by pointing to the side.
  
 
  
Rosario had been sitting in the same spot for a week. She knew she sat on the only bench in the area. But, when she looked to her right she saw another teenage girl she'd never seen sitting on a bench that wasn't there five minutes ago. This time, Emily walked over to the new girl.
  
 
  
"Hi, you're the new kid, right?" Emily asked the red-headed teen. She quickly nodded. "I'm Emily, this is Aurora. We've got a club that hangs out after school, wanna join us?"
  
 
  
"I'd like that!" the teen nodded. "My name's Rose," she stood and shook Emily's hand. "What kind of club?"
  
 
  
"We hunt monsters," Emily answered as they began to walk away. Though, Aurora lagged behind a bit. She turned to Rosario and smiled.
  
 
  
"Meet here after school?" she asked. Rosario nodded silently. She had no idea how to process what was happening and it must have shown on her face. "You okay?"
  
 
  
"I don't know what's going on...," Rosario shook her head. Aurora gently patted her on the shoulder.
  
 
  
"That happens sometimes," she giggled. "Don't sweat it though, you've got friends now. Besides, look at it this way," she grinned and followed up her pat with a friendly punch on Rosario's shoulder. "At least you're not the monster we're hunting anymore."
