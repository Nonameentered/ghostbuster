\[Sharp Reality\]

A flash of annoyed confusion washed over Ms. Dana Sharp's pale, stern face. It happened faster than most people in the room could tell, then, her face was neutral and cold again. The room was filled with the three highest-ranking members of the Hero League, Ms. Sharp, and Melody. Only Melody, Ms. Sharp's wife, was able to see the change in demeanor. Ms. Sharp was mad; Melody giggled to herself.
  
 
  
"This meeting was wholly unnecessary," Ms. Sharp said. "You're all free to quit the League at any time. Just turn in the appropriate form and be on your way."
  
 
  
"You don't understand, Dana," HeroMax, the League's leader spoke up as he looked down on the seated woman. "We're not quitting, we're firing you," he said. "The Hero League no longer wants to be associated with Sharp Development."
  
 
  
"Is that right?" Ms. Sharp stood from her seat with a smirk. A black portal appeared behind her. "Melody, deal with this for me, please. I don't care how. I have actual work to do," she stepped backward into the portal and it closed around her.
  
 
  
"Yes, Ms. Sharp!" Melody nodded with glee. She rarely got to have any fun.
  
 
  
"Where'd she go?" HeroMax asked. "We weren't done talking to her yet...," he added.
  
 
  
"She went to another Earth to get some work done," Melody said.
  
 
  
"What?" HeroMax asked. "You mean like a parallel Earth?"
  
 
  
"I mean a different Earth that Sharp Development also serves," Melody nodded. "We have a presence on millions of alternate Earths, many of them with a Sharp Hero's League," Melody pulled out three red, translucent clipboards from a white briefcase and handed them to the three heroes. "But, you don't have to worry about that, you're quitting."
  
 
  
"We're not quitting," HeroMax shook his head. "It's not right that a corporation determines who's a hero, and who we get to help. The Hero's League is going to help everyone, even if they can't pay for it."
  
 
  
"The Hero's League is owned by Sharp Development," Melody replied. "It is the only government-sanctioned super-team. Unlicensed Heroics will not be tolerated."
  
 
  
"Unlicensed heroics?" HeroMax asked. "You can't be serious... you can't stop us from helping people."
  
 
  
"On the contrary," Melody nodded. "We have every right to stop you, this Earth belongs to Sharp Development. That means it functions the way Ms. Sharp chooses. If you're not a licensed hero with the League, you are ineligible to offer heroic assistance to anyone."
  
 
  
"Wait...," HeroMax shook his head. "You own Earth? No one can own Earth...," Melody smirked.
  
 
  
"Clearly, you don't know what Ms. Sharp is capable of," she replied. "She owns millions of individual Earths. And, I am eager to get back to work with her," she added. "Please sign if you're going to quit. If you'd like to continue working with Sharp Development, you may leave it blank.
  
 
  
MegaMini, the short, blonde woman raised her hand.
  
 
  
"Can we transfer to another Earth?" she asked. Melody nodded.
  
 
  
"If you're still part of the League, you can ask to transfer to any other branch on any other Earth," she said. Megamini stood and returned the clipboard to Melody.
  
 
  
"I'd like to see some other Earths," she said.
  
 
  
"I thought we agreed we were in this together!" HeroMax turned his attention to MegaMini. She giggled, then shook her head.
  
 
  
"We were, at first," she said. "When you brought it up you used the argument that 'certain corporations' have too much say in our roster and who we help.
  
 
  
"Yeah!" HeroMax said. "Corporations like Sharp Development."
  
 
  
"Yeah," MegaMini nodded, then she shook her head. "Except, the more I thought about it, the more I realized something. There are no OTHER corporations," she said.
  
 
  
"What?" HeroMax was surprised.
  
 
  
"Whoa...," the third hero present, Blue Knight, said. He stood up and gave his clipboard back to Melody also. "... how did we miss that..?" he asked.
  
 
  
"You're very observant," Melody nodded at MegaMini. "Sharp Development bought every other corporation on this Earth. We own the corporations, we own the governments," she smiled. "We own the Earth."
  
 
  
"No...," HeroMax shook his head. "You can't decide who lives or dies based on how much they can afford to pay you. It's not right to control people that way...," he said. Melody smirked and shook her head.
  
 
  
"I believe Ms. Sharp is far more knowledgeable about what can and can't be done than you are," she said. "MegaMini and the Blue Knight have decided to continue being members of the League," Melody said. "What's you're decision?"
  
 
  
"I'm deciding to have principles..," HeroMax grumbled. He scrawled his name at the bottom of the form, then handed the board back to Melody.
  
 
  
"I see," she said. Then, she turned to the other two.
  
 
  
"MegaMini, congratulations on your promotion, you're the leader of the Hero's League now." The short, blonde woman glanced at HeroMax, then she nodded at Melody.
  
 
  
"Thank you, Ma'am," she said.
  
 
  
"There is a known villain on the premises," Melody turned and glared at HeroMax. He took a step back in surprise. "He's known to be violent, you are authorized to use deadly force."
