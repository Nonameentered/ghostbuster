\[Starting. Useless.\]

Franklin sat down on a crate to catch his breath. It was all he could do. The warehouse manager gave him a simple task that was not urgent while everyone else worked on more important things. All he had to do was unload the pillows and organize 100 different sets of bedding. An hour and a half later, he was taking a break after unloading the 100th pillow. They were vacuum-sealed, dense packages that were heavier than they looked. While his breathing settled, he couldn't help but feel useless.
  
 
  
"Why did you get picked?" A voice spoke the very thought on his mind. He looked up to make sure it didn't come from him. It was a teenage boy with pale, almost blue skin and bright blue hair pulled back in a ponytail. Franklin had met the other 99 colonists already. The corporate-appointed mayor made sure to introduce him as deadweight so the other colonists wouldn't expect much. This teen would have stood out among the crowd but he did not look familiar.
  
 
  
"I'm sorry?" Franklin answered. "Who are you?"
  
 
  
"I'm Frost," he replied. "I'm helping Sharp Development oversee the start."
  
 
  
"You work for Sharp Development!?" Franklin asked. Then, he remembered his manners. "I'm Franklin," he bowed his head for a moment. The company was so ingrained in his society that he felt an almost obligatory awe for any of its employees. Every product he ever consumed, including entertainment, was labeled with the Sharp logo. It was common knowledge that every 500 years 100 humans would be transported to an alternate dimension. The ones who were chosen would be remembered by the history books and advertising campaigns for centuries to come; they always were. Despite the dominance of Sharp Development products, Franklin had never met an employee. Nor did he know anyone that had.
  
 
  
"I'm working with them," Frost nodded. Franklin was so star-struck that he forgot Frost's initial comment. He finally met an employee from Sharp Development, and it was when he needed one the most. He had a burning question in his mind.
  
 
  
"Do you know why I was picked for the colony?" he asked.
  
 
  
"No," Frost shook his head. He raised his hand chest high, then flicked his wrist upward. Franklin watched him swipe at an invisible surface. "All your stats are below average," he chuckled. "And some even lower than that. No special skills to unlock either. I have no idea." Franklin did not know where Frost was getting his information from. But, he couldn't deny the accuracy of the description.
  
 
  
"Hey, there you are," a teen girl joined them. She had short, straight dark hair. She ignored Franklin and spoke directly to Frost. "You still need to approve all the personnel or the tutorial won't go on to the next step."
  
 
  
"I got a worthless unit," Frost said. "Can I restart?"
  
 
  
"Don't worry, it's fine," the girl shook her head.
  
 
  
"Fine how?" Frost asked. Both of them seemed to forget Franklin was sitting there in front of them. "I don't want to spend resources to upgrade him later...," he argued.
  
 
  
"You won't," she began to pull Frost away as Franklin watched with uncertain curiosity. He knew they were talking about him and how worthless he was. He knew he should be offended, or at the very least, annoyed. But, he couldn't find it in himself. They were from Sharp Development; they knew better than he did.
  
 
  
"It's probably easier to start over," Franklin heard Frost say before they were completely out of earshot. The girl shook her head and Franklin heard her giggle.
  
 
  
"You'll get him or another one just like him," she said. "It's part of the tutorial, you'll get the materials to upgrade him for free. The upgraded version is a great starter." Frost stopped and turned back to look at Franklin. He tried sitting up to appear more attentive.
  
 
  
"Are you sure?" Frost asked. The girl nodded and dragged Frost away.
  
 
  
"Yes," she said. "Trust me, I've played this game a bunch of times already."
  
 
  
"Huh?" Franklin found that statement interesting. He almost wanted to hop up and follow them to ask her what she meant. But, he stayed put and hoped they'd be back. He still hadn't caught his breath yet and he felt that getting up to chase them might leave him light-headed. He sat, and waited, still out of breath and hoping he could catch it soon. It was all he could do.
