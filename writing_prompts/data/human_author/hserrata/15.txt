\[Hopping Curiosity\]

David might have ignored them if they weren't headed toward his station. 'Town', and even 'settlement' were too big to be used for the handful of buildings the Arctic Grove used as an outpost. It wasn't unusual to see adventurers crossing the frigid field; but, he couldn't remember any visiting his Grove recently. Caution and curiosity drove him forward to find out more. Light green magical energy gathered around David as he moved forward. After a few steps he'd shrunk and changed shape into a small, snow-white bunny and he hopped forward to catch the figures.
  
 
  
He confirmed the three of them were adventurers once he was close enough. A teenage boy with shaggy blue hair wore a silky black and green robe. One of the teenage girls with chestnut hair and pink highlights looked like a ninja wearing in her tight, dark violet outift. Although, her face wasn't covered. The third member of the group was another teenage girl with blond, double-plaited hair; she wore a druid's leather robe. David felt a bit more at ease once he spotted she was a fellow druid. But, she was still a stranger and he had no idea why they were there. He followed close behind and began listening in on their conversation.
  
 
  
"No...," the blonde girl shook her head. "...I don't have anything else planned after this. Need help with something?" she asked.
  
 
  
"No!" The ninja girl shook her head rapidly as if persistently denying something. But, the boy broke out into a fit of laughter that told a different story.
  
 
  
"Yes!" The boy added while laughing. It faded quickly while they walked and he elaborated. "My buddy, Alis, here," he nudged her in the side with his elbow. "...has a quest she's been putting off because she's been waiting for when Molly's available to help. She can finally help today; but, Rerun's busy so we're still one short."
  
 
  
"It's fine, we don't need to bother Crystal with it," the ninja said.
  
 
  
"It's really no bother...," the blonde girl stopped walking and turned to face the ninja. David assumed their names were Crystal and Alis by now. "...you two came to help me, so of course, I'm going to help you," she said. "Besides, it'll give me a chance to test out my new ability, once I get it," she said.
  
 
  
David relaxed as he listened. He wasn't going to lower his guard completely. But, at least it sounded like they were already discussing what to do after visiting his outpost. And, he even got a clue as to why they were going. The trio moved forward again as he debated what to do next.
  
 
  
"Do you know anything about the reward yet?" Alis asked. "Sometimes quests drop a specific ability and sometimes it's random," she elaborated. Crystal nodded.
  
 
  
"I'm not sure how much of a 'quest' this is," she giggled. "It's basically - 'talk to the guy. Learn the skill.' It's a Snowball spell that heals allies or damages opponents," she shrugged. "I really appreciate the company; but, I did tell you it was something I could do alone."
  
 
  
"Yeah," the boy nodded. "But, Molly told us you're a friend of the guild and we didn't have anything better to do anyway."
  
 
  
David's indecision was solved as he heard more of their conversation. Despite being strangers, they seemed to be friendly. And, more importantly, he learned they were there to see him. If he acted now, perhaps they wouldn't have to visit the outpost at all. It was one thing to welcome kind strangers to his home; but, it was an even better situation if they never visited at all.
  
 
  
"Excuse me...," David spoke up from behind him. He began the shift to his human form and they all turned in time to see him finish the transformation from bunny to man. He focused on Crystal the druid. "...did you say you wanted to learn how to cast Snowball?"
  
 
  
"Yeah...," she took a step forward and gave him a decisive nod. "... but I have a more important question," she said.
  
 
  
"Yes? What would you like to know?" David asked. Alis and the blue-haired boy also turned and looked at Crystal with curious interest. The blonde teen grinned and her blue eyes sparkled.
  
 
  
"Can you teach me how to turn into a rabbit too, or do I have to learn that from someone else?"
