\[Sewing Destruction\] 

"Alright, you can do this...," Otis sighed to himself when he spotted the pair of teenage girls. He had his hands full shearing sheep in the barn when two girls stepped on his property and headed towards him. They didn't wear the usual armor and weapons of the other adventurers. But, experience taught him that there was only one reason strangers stopped by. The girl with short dark hair was dressed stylishly with a pair of dark slacks, a white dress shirt and a black and white vest. Her friend with long silver hair wore a simple t-shirt and jeans; the only thing that stood out about her was a silver box strapped to her left wrist. In the back of his mind, he hoped that they weren't there to improve the farm again. Even if they were just girls, he'd always had trouble pushing back against whatever the adventurers wanted. But, this time, his marriage was on the line.
  
 
  
Otis went about his business and ignored the teens until they talked to him. It didn't take long for them to find him in the barn.
  
 
  
"Hi," the silver-haired girl waved as both smiled at the old farmer. "I'm Emily, and this is my friend Vivi," she said. Otis relaxed a bit; none of the other adventurers ever bothered with introductions. They simply showed up and began doing as they pleased.
  
 
  
"Otis," he gave his name with a nod, then let the shorn sheep go out and join the others while he began collecting the wool. "Something I can do for you?" he asked.
  
 
  
"I'm on a quest," Vivi nodded. "I need-," Otis interrupted with a shake of his head and a firm voice.
  
 
  
"No ma'am," he said. He was proud of himself for getting the words out; he'd never been able to before. But, this time he felt different. He loved his wife too much and if he let any more adventurers grow his farm again she was going to leave him.
  
 
  
"Oh, I'm sorry, are you the wrong one?" Vivi asked. The teen flicked her wrist upward at her waist and began touching some invisible surface that her gaze was intently focused on. Otis wasn't going to let her pantomime distract him. He turned and focused on Emily.
  
 
  
"Look, every month or so we get adventurers like you determined to make my farm bigger. I'm not saying I didn't appreciate it at first; but, enough is enough. If we get any bigger, the dark lord in the fortress next door is going to start feeling threatened. And if he's feeling threatened my wife won't feel safe. So, do my marriage a favor and take your quests elsewhere," he said. After a moment, he added, "Please."
  
 
  
"No, you're the right one," Vivi said. "I'm on a quest; but, I'm not here to grow your farm!" she hurried out the words before he interrupted her again. Otis wasn't expecting that.
  
 
  
"Then, what?" he asked. Vivi pointed at the bag of wool at his feet.
  
 
  
"I'm a tailor," she said. "I just need some of your wool to move on to the next step of the quest. It's somewhere else," she said. "I'll pay for it."
  
 
  
"Well...," Otis considered it for a moment as he sized up the two girls. They seemed friendly enough and he didn't think they were lying. "...and my farm isn't going to get any bigger if I sell it to you?" he asked.
  
 
  
"No," Vivi shook her head. "Your farm is already leveled up all the way. It's as big as it's going to get," she said.
  
 
  
"Really?" Otis relaxed considerably. "So, no more adventurers coming through? That's great!" he grinned.
  
 
  
"What's your favorite number?" Emily asked Otis. He shrugged.
  
 
  
"Can't say I've given it much thought," he said. Both girls looked at each other and nodded. Then, they turned back to Otis.
  
 
  
"You're still going to get adventurers," Emily said. 
  
 
  
"I'm here now," Vivi added with a friendly half-wave.
  
 
  
"Now that your farm can't get any bigger until it's destroyed, they'll be on different quests; like buying your goods," Emily said.
  
 
  
"Oh. Well, I guess I don't mind that too much," Otis said. He handed Vivi the bag of wool and she gave him a small golden cube. He didn't know what it was, nor what it was worth; but, he was confident it was an appropriate amount.
  
 
  
"Much appreciated," Otis said. The girls turned to walk out of the barn and he heard the last bits of their conversation as they left.
  
 
  
"Portal?" Emily asked Vivi. She shook her head.
  
 
  
"No point," Vivi said as she opened the bag and reached inside. "The dark lord lives right next door. If we walk, I can finish making his magic robe by the time we get there."
