\[Keys to Magic\] 

"HELP!!" Denise screamed as she ran. "SOMEONE!!!!" She was already out of breath but she had to keep moving. About a half-dozen stringy, short, sickly green goblins were having more fun chasing her than they would when they caught her. They growled and yipped while keeping pace with the teen. This wasn't what her 18th birthday was supposed to be like.
  
 
  
After the sudden abandonment by her parents, Denise had nothing else to do but look through the backpack they gave her. They told her they loved her, then pushed her through a black portal. She landed in a lush, bright forest with plenty of sunlight poking through the trees. She settled down in the shade and began going through the contents of the bag. She found a full-sized broom that was too big to fit into the bag, but she pulled it out just the same. She also found a map and a white book with a red title on the front: "Spell Book", and lastly, a map of Earth that didn't look quite right. Both of the Americas were labeled simply as "Toku-High", as well as a marked location for Atlantis. There were also some snacks, drinks, and first aid supplies in the bag. When she was convinced there was nothing else of interest in the bag, Denise finally opened the Spell Book.
  
 
  
The first page was blank with a stiff, transparent window in it; the sheet did not bend past the clear rectangle. But, she could see text through it and quickly went to the next page. The header was labeled "Wizard Spells" and it was followed by a wall of colorful text in alphabetical order. Spell names were bolded in one color and a description followed it, with different keywords in different colors. Denise glanced down the list for the first one that caught her eye; none of the other spells sounded interesting to her.
  
 
  
"\[Arcane Eruption\]," she read. "Deals Moderate Arcane Damage to a target and Minor Arcane Damage to any Opponent within 1/8 Track from the Target..... what track?" Denise was not able to put more thought into it. She heard crunching leaves in the distance and hoped it was her parents. She quickly tossed things back into the bag along with the Spell Book.
  
 
  
"Mom? Dad??" She spoke up as she reached for the broom. A small, green head poked around the tree and growled at her. The goblin was shorter than she was. Its lean frame rippled with muscles as he raised a rusted shortsword at her; she ran.
  
 
  
She kept her eyes on the path and ran straight ahead; she knew better than to try and hide in their forest. She heard more and more goblins join the chase as she ran out of breath.
  
 
  
"Please...," she begged with her last effort. The stitch in her side was too painful to continue and her lungs could not get enough air. She tripped on the bare dirt path and tumbled to the ground face-first.
  
 
  
"YARRR!!" the goblin with the rusted sword reached her first. Denise managed to roll over and look up. He leaped forward intent on impaling her; Denise shut her eyes so that his ugly green face wasn't the last thing she saw.
  
 
  
\[Elemental Temper: Void Needle\] a deep voice filled the air. Then, a high-pitched squeal followed it. It sounded directly in front of her. After a moment, the final blow never came, and she heard another squeal further away.
  
 
  
Denise peeked her eyes open for a moment, then she sat up and took a better look. A lean young man in dark leather armor was surrounded by the goblins. He had short, coppery-red hair and he wielded a long, thin sword with a black blade. He thrust forward and ran the blade through another goblin. It squealed, then disintegrated into black dust.
  
 
  
All the goblins surrounded the newcomer, and they were disappearing one by one. Denise felt safe enough to get to her feet as she watched the action. The stranger's rapier changed color from black to silvery steel. He was still surrounded by four goblins. She watched him run an orange, glowing hand along the blade, then she heard the booming voice again.
  
 
  
\[Elemental Temper: Wildfire\] A hot orange glow instantly surrounded the thin blade. The teen struck at the two goblins in the middle with fast, straight pokes. They burst into flames that spread to the other two goblins as the stranger sheathed his sword. He turned and approached Denise.
  
 
  
"You okay?" he asked.
  
 
  
"Yes, thank you," she nodded.
  
 
  
"You're welcome," he nodded. Then, he lingered a moment with his attention on her. Not sure what else to say, she knelt to get her backpack and a couple of things that fell out. "Is that it?" he asked. Denise sighed and shook her head at him from the ground. She loaded snacks and water bottles into the bag.
  
 
  
"Are you charging me for saving my life??" she asked.
  
 
  
"That's usually...," he started to nod, but he stopped. "Oh, you're a player, sorry," he said.
  
 
  
"Huh?" Denise was stuffing the spellbook into the bag as she got to her feet again.
  
 
  
"Those goblins aren't usually a problem for players," he said. "I thought you were an NPC that needed rescuing."
  
 
  
"Look, I don't know what you're talking about," Denise said. "But, you seem trustworthy; I'm really really lost," she said. Despite the things she'd seen, Denise wasn't eager to mention the portal. She had no idea how he would react.
  
 
  
"You have a spellbook," he chuckled. "You can't be that lost," he said. He stretched out his hand. "My name's Keys," he said.
  
 
  
"Denise," she shook his hand. If nothing else, she wasn't alone anymore; and, he seemed capable of taking care of himself. "Do you have a Spellbook too?"
  
 
  
"Sure," Keys nodded. "All magic-using classes do," he said. Then, he chuckled again. "Someone really gave you the short version, huh?" 
  
 
  
"Short version of what?" Denise asked. Keys tilted his head at her. 
  
 
  
"How did you get a Spellbook?" he asked. She did not want him to think she was crazy, but he was willing to help. Denise didn't know if she'd have another opportunity. 
  
 
  
"My parents gave me a backpack full of stuff and pushed me through a portal…," she said. "The book was in the bag." 
  
 
  
"Hah!" Keys laughed obnoxiously, then shook his head. "C'mon, I'll take you to Mundo," he grinned. He turned and started walking. "You've got some pretty cool parents," he smiled.
  
 
  
"Cool?!" she said. "I would have died if you didn't save me!" 
  
 
  
"Probably," he chuckled. "But, you would have respawned anyway."
