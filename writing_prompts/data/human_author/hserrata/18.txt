"Oh man...," Rosario sighed to herself. She stopped by the mansion expecting to be able to do her job quickly. But, after she hopped over the gate, she found a line of people waiting outside one of the windows on the ground floor. "Eh, I'll come back later...," Rosario decided to postpone her task for another time; but, she changed her mind instantly as she turned away. She spotted an elderly woman with shoulder-length salt & pepper hair queueing up at the end of the line.
  
 
  
"No way...," Rosario strode to the line with her focus on the old woman's mechanical legs. They were over-engineered cybernetics painted orange and silver with visible gears, tubes, and wires. If Rosario hadn't noticed the legs, she might have ignored the old woman as a stranger like everyone else. But, her legs made it obvious who she was; and, Rosario never met anyone famous before.
  
 
  
"Excuse me...," Rosario fell in line behind the woman and tapped her on the shoulder. "...I'm sorry to bother you. Are you Ciani, from CyberRiot?" The woman nodded; her face settled into well-wore smile lines and her eyes sparkled at being recognized.
  
 
  
"That's me," she said. "What's your name?" she asked.
  
 
  
"I'm Rosario," Rosario introduced herself and they exchanged a handshake. The line moved forward and each of them took a step closer to the window. But, Rosario was struck with a stray thought. She tilted her head at Ciani, then she glanced at the line waiting to break in through the window.
  
 
  
"You're not a thief...," she said. "What are you doing here?" Ciani smiled at her and gave a faint nod.
  
 
  
"You don't know many Librarians, do you?" she asked.
  
 
  
"None," Rosario shook her head.
  
 
  
"You're here for the quest, right?" Ciani asked. Rosario nodded.
  
 
  
"Well, you're in luck," Ciani winked at her. Then, she flicked her wrist up to summon her Slate. The large, translucent pane of glass appeared and hovered in front of her and she began tapping and swiping on it. "I'll give you a brief lesson on the benefits of knowing a good Librarian," she said.
  
 
  
"Okay," Rosario nodded; but, she wasn't sure what to expect.
  
 
  
"Ah, here it is," Ciani said. She tapped a section of the Slate several times, then a thin edge emerged from the flat surface. Ciani pulled the transparent, card-sized node out of the Slate and offered it to Rosario.
  
 
  
"What's this?" Rosario accepted the node and looked it over. She spotted the name: \[Smash & Grab\] in red text and her eyes went wide in surprise. She looked ahead at the line. It was shorter now; but, there were still four or five people in front of Ciani.
  
 
  
"How did you get the quest reward already?? How can you do the quest??" Rosario asked. She was under the impression that it was a quest for thieves only. She tried to give the node back; but, Ciani refused it.
  
 
  
"That's yours, I have more copies," she said.  "Librarians can complete any quest. And we can redistribute any awards we can't use."
  
 
  
"Wait, if you already have copies, why are you doing the quest again?" Rosario asked. She tried handing the node back. "Do you need it for your guild?" Ciani refused the node again.
  
 
  
"I stockpile skills for the guild," she nodded. "But, all our thieves already have this one; and, I've got spares for any new recruits. I'm doing the quest again to study it," Ciani explained. "If a Librarian does certain quests enough times, they can Master it. Mastering this quest will let me give out the reward any time I want to anyone."
  
 
  
"Whooaaa... Librarians are awesome...," Rosario was amazed.
  
 
  
"Indeed we are," Ciani giggled.
  
 
  
"Is it really okay if I keep this?" Rosario held up the ability node to make sure. Ciani nodded.
  
 
  
"I would've already charged you if it wasn't," she giggled.
  
 
  
"Thank you!" Rosario grinned as the line moved forward again. Ciani was now the next one to go once the window opened again. "I guess you don't need my help for the quest either, huh?" Rosario asked. Ciani shook her head.
  
 
  
"I haven't for the first 100 times so far," she grinned.
  
 
  
"Thanks so much!" Rosario said. She stepped out of the line to let the strangers behind her take a step forward. "Can I visit sometime to see what other skills you have?"
  
 
  
"Of course, dear," Ciani nodded. The window behind her flew open with a loud thunk. "It's always nice to have visitors, good luck," Ciani waved at Rosario as she backed towards the window. Then, the old woman tumbled backward through it and the window slammed shut. Rosario walked away and everyone in line took a step forward.
