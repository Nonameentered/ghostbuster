"We have a problem," L. S. pulled John aside and whispered in his ear. He nodded at the table with a man and a woman sitting across from each other. The woman, John's wife, with royal purple curls just defeated the lean, athletic man in the first of five arm-wrestling matches. A small crowd of bar patrons, Supers and civilians milled around waiting for the next match. L. S. arrived after the first match started and he spent some time asking questions before he approached John.
  
 
  
"What is it?" John asked. He focused on his old, aged friend with silver hair. L. S. was once upon a time, the worst of Supervillains. After repeated run-ins with John the Superhero, he began turning things around. That process only sped up once he met John's wife, Majesty. They were all quite close now, and L. S. was a frequent visitor to the family home.
  
 
  
"He's a new Supervillain," L. S. added. "Goes by the name, Power Vacuum." As he explained, the second match began. Power Vacuum grunted with effort and Majesty's hand was pushed back a fraction of an inch. The match was already longer than the first one with that extra push. Majesty made a noticeable effort to shift her weight and lean into it; an effort she didn't need for the first match.
  
 
  
"That's what I was worried about," L. S. commented after the second match was over. Majesty won again, but it seemed she needed to try harder. "He drains Superpowers. We need to put a stop to this," he added. He placed a hand on John's shoulder for support. "I'm with you."
  
 
  
"She'll be fine," John grinned and shook his head. "But thanks for looking out for us, L. S.," he patted the wrinkled hand on his shoulder. The third match between Majesty and Power Vacuum began.
  
 
  
"What?" L. S. asked. He batted John's hand away. "If this keeps up, she's going to lose! She only has to lose once out of five tries." L. S. had known John for a while. If it were anyone else, he wouldn't have wasted time and breath explaining what he should have already known. But John had a tendency to just go along with things.
  
 
  
"It's just a bar bet," John chuckled. "But, I know she won't lose."
  
 
  
"Then why is she still struggling!?" L. S. pointed out that the third match was still happening. Majesty appeared to be struggling to drive the villain's hand down. John grinned at L. S.
  
 
  
"Because she's having fun," he said. At his words, the third match ended with Majesty's third win.
  
 
  
"It's not losing the bet on worried about, he's stealing her powers! Majesty's strong enough to destroy the Earth, we don't need him that strong!" He yelled as quietly as he could. Luckily most of the attention was focused on the competitors readying themselves for the fourth match.
  
 
  
"She's a Unique Soul, not a Super," John said. The crowd was cheering louder as Majesty struggled with her hand bent backward. Power Vacuum started strong, but was having trouble closing the gap.
  
 
  
"What difference does it make?!" L. S. asked. "She's obviously losing her powers!" but John shook his head.
  
 
  
"It's kind of an important distinction," John said. Majesty managed to gain some space and brought their hands back up to the midpoint and grunted as she tried to push further. "Supers are people born with extra abilities that other people usually don't have."
  
 
  
"She can crack the Earth, that's not something people can usually do," L. S. replied. John nodded in agreement.
  
 
  
"People, no. But, for a Calavera Unique, that's pretty standard. Superpowers can be taken away or manipulated because they're abnormal additions. Unique Souls are born with their abilities written on their soul." A roar of cheer ran through the bar when Majesty finally managed to push Power Vacuum's hand down to the table. They applauded and patted the woman on her shoulders with glee.
  
 
  
"Do you not see how much she's struggling? Majesty can normally wipe the floor with that guy!" L.S. replied. John looked at L.S. for a moment; it was the first time he truly looked at his friend that night; he'd been too distracted watching his wife.
  
 
  
"You're really worried?" he asked.
  
 
  
"WHY AREN'T YOU?" L.S. asked. John turned his attention back to the table. Majesty and Power Vacuum were gripping their hands for the fifth and final match.
  
 
  
"Because I know my wife," John grinned. "Hey babe!" he called out to  Majesty. She looked up as the referee held his hand on the competitor's hands and counted down from three.
  
 
  
"Yeah?" she asked. She looked out of breath and rather worn out from the extended exertion. John tilted his head at the old, lean man next to him.
  
 
  
"L.S. is worried," he said.
  
 
  
"What? No way!" Majesty replied. As soon as she answered her husband, the referee let go of their hands.
  
 
  
"GO!" he said. Majesty slammed her opponent's hand down in a casual motion as if she was repositioning her hand to lie flat on the table; and, his just happened to be in the way.
  
 
  
"L. S....," Majesty stood from her barstool as the crowd took an extra moment to process how fast that victory happened. She jogged over to her husband and their friend. She wrapped her arms around L. S.  Don't worry, I'm just playing around," she giggled. John wrapped his arm around her waist and smiled at L. S.
  
 
  
"Whatever Superpowers that guy has, he can't affect her," John said. "She's strong enough to crack the Earth like an egg; but, it's not an extra ability," he added. "That's just who she is."
