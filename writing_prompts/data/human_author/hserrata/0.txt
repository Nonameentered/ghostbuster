"Welcome to the AlterNet!" The voice spoke as the screen went solid white. A red logo that resembled scissors appeared on the white screen along with a red progress bar that was growing larger.
  
 
  
"AlterNet?" Nina glanced at the empty white and red cardboard sleeve. It clearly said 'AOL' on it and Nina remembered hearing about an 'AOL' service when she was younger. Although, she was under the impression it stood for 'America OnLine. The progress bar filled solid red and the screen changed again.
  
 
  
The red logo remained on the white screen; but, small text was added to the bottom corner that read: AlterNet OnLine. And, a question appeared beneath the scissors.
  
 
  
Update? \[Yes.\] \[No.\]
  
 
  
"Sure," Nina shrugged and guided the mouse cursor to click on \[Yes.\] But, she was startled before she got there.
  
 
  
"I wouldn't do that," a male voice made her jump in her seat. She spun in her chair to see who was in her own house behind her; but, there was no one there.
  
 
  
"Who said that??" Nina asked as she took a second look around her small home office.
  
 
  
"Over here," the voice called to Nina and she followed it to a golden, faceless man in a red suit standing on one of her monitors. His head was only vaguely oval-shaped and he reminded Nina of a solid gold mannequin. "My name is Helios," the mannequin gave a formal bow. Nina glanced at the white screen with AlterNet Online, then she studied Helios. His suit was the same shade of bright red as the logo and the golden cufflinks on his wrists were scissor-shaped. Nina was smart enough to realize that his appearance wasn't a coincidence.
  
 
  
"How are you in my computer, Helios?" Nina asked.
  
 
  
"I'm an A.I.," Helios shrugged. "I can be in any computer I want," he said. Then, his voice surrounded her as he appeared on her TV off to the side. He appeared on her phone, her tablet on the desk, and even her watch. "I can be on any screen I want," all his selves spoke simultaneously. Nina was impressed; but, also suspicious.
  
 
  
"What do you want?" Nina asked. She didn't exactly doubt his story; but, she knew it was irrelevant whether he was being honest or not. He was there for a reason and she needed to know what that was before she decided what to believe.
  
 
  
"A simple favor," Helios said. He pointed at the white screen on the monitor next to his. "Don't update that," he said. "And, I'll need you to give the disc to the first person that asks."
  
 
  
"What? Why?" Nina asked. "What's the AlterNet?"
  
 
  
"The AlterNet is a network of alternate Earths," Helios replied. "That disc has an old version that someone I know is interested in. If you give it to him, I can give you the latest version." As he made his case, Helios held up a transparent glass card on the screen. "This node will allow you to travel to other realities, not just send messages," he said. Then, a sudden knock at the door startled Nina again.
  
 
  
"That's my friend," Helios said. He shrunk into the corner of the display as if hiding behind the screen bezel. "He doesn't know I'm here; but, he's going to want that disc," he said.
  
 
  
Nina hadn't realized the decision was made until she pressed the eject button on the tower. She had a lot of emotions happening at the same time; but, one particular thought stood out like a beacon. She believed Helios. She couldn't explain why she believed him; but, she couldn't find an excuse to doubt it either. And, if he was being honest about alternate Earths, then she knew exactly what to do with that information. Nina loaded the disc in its cardboard sleeve and then left the room. She was only gone for a couple of minutes before she returned to the room.
  
 
  
"Your friend's name is Turbo?" she asked with a giggle. Helios was a strange name; but, if he was an A.I. then it made sense. But, she never expected to meet a teenage kid named 'Turbo'. "If he didn't know you were here why did he come for the disc?" she asked.
  
 
  
"He's been looking for something like this," Helios said. "The disc checked the servers when it booted up and Turbo got a notification," he said.
  
 
  
"He's been looking for an old version? Why?" Nina asked. Then, she shook her head. "Nevermind. I did my part, I'm done with all that," she held her hand out in front of the monitor. "My ticket to other universes please," she said. Helios held the node up on screen, and a black hole opened next to him. A similar black hole opened in the air next to Nina's hand. He pushed the node into the hole next to him and the glass card came out of the hole to land on Nina's palm.
  
 
  
"You might want to do the tutorial first," Helios said. "After that, the multiverse is yours. Good luck," Helios waved.
  
 
  
"Before I get my hopes up...," Nina spoke up. Helios was fading away to invisible nothing; but, he resolidified in full color at her words. "...is there a way to find a specific person?" she asked. "I mean, a different version of them?" Helios nodded with a chuckle.
  
 
  
"Absolutely, finding your other Zeros is easy, the tutorial covers it early on."
  
 
  
"My... Zeros?" she asked.
  
 
  
"The other versions of you," Helios replied. "You were asking to find your doppelgangers right?"
  
 
  
"Oh,..no," she shook her head. "Not me..., can you help me find other versions of my dad?"
