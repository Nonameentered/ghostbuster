The crackling fire provided just enough light to illuminate the four adventurers seated around it. They stopped to rest outside the gates of a castle town that could no longer be seen in the dark of a starless night. Their goal was inside the ancient castle; but, they needed to fight their way there and out again. The castle and town had been abandoned ages ago by the people and the undead took over. But, they never ventured outside the town gates.
  

  
"...and I never saw either of them again," the necromancer finished his tale with heavy, tear-filled eyes.
  

  
"My mother was taken to Hell...," the ranger said after a short silence.  "...I never saw my father again either. I'm assuming he abandoned us and left us for dead."
  

  
"Huh," Rosario, the thief, uttered the curious noise.
  

  
"What's up?" Emily looked up from her cards at Rosario. She was preparing for the assault on the castle. Technically she was a card mage; but, she was there as the team's healer. Rosario glanced at the necromancer and ranger on the other side of the fire; they appeared to be lost in thought given the similarity of their backstories. Then, she focused on Emily.
  

  
"Is the ranger the necromancer's son?" she asked. Emily shrugged with a grin.
  

  
"Probably," she said.
  

  
"But... how?" Rosario asked. "They're NPC companions, right?" Emily nodded. Unfortunately, the rest of the team was too busy to help with the quest and she organized NPCs to round out the group.
  

  
"You're still kind of new to the AlterNet, so it'll take some time to learn all the little things," Emily explained. "They're not actually related, it's a story quest for players to do if they want to learn more lore or do some role-playing. If we start asking about it they'll realize they're 'father and son'," Emily added air quotes around their family ties. "Then, we can go on a quest to rescue the wife from Hell."
  

  
Rosario nodded along with the explanation. She'd seen her share of amazing things once she started exploring the AlterNet; but, some things still surprised her. She glanced at the necromancer and ranger again. Their hairstyles were similar, though the necromancer's hair held more silver and grey than brown. They had the same eyes and nose and the more she studied them the more apparent their relation was.
  

  
"Are you sure...?" Rosario asked. "They look like family." Emily nodded with a grin.
  

  
"Watch," she said. She set her cards down on the large glass slate that hovered in front of her, then she looked across the fire.
  

  
"Hey guys, what's your favorite number?" she asked. The necromancer stared at her silently for a moment before looking down again.
  

  
"If I ever find my cowardly father, I'll make sure he regrets abandoning us," the ranger said. Then, he looked down at the fire.
  

  
"Just checking," Emily winked at Rosario, then she began tapping and swiping on her Slate. Rosario watched with interest but after a moment Emily stopped and looked back at her. She noticed she had Rosario's attention and directed it to the other side of the campfire.
  

  
"It was a night as dark as this...," the necromancer repeated the beginning of his story with a different voice; this time, he was an older woman with long dark hair. "... demons took my husband to Hell...," she continued. Rosario wasn't surprised at the change, she was used to that sort of thing by now. But, she looked closer at what Emily was showing her. The woman had the same eyes and nose as the ranger.
  

  
"They look alike too...," she spoke aloud as she processed the thought. "..oooh, so the AlterNet does that on purpose?" she asked. Emily nodded.
  

  
"Now you got it," she said. "Do you want to do their quest? We can come back and finish yours after; but, if we don't accept it now we won't have a chance to do it later." Rosario nodded once, then, she shook her head once; she wasn't sure.
  

  
"You realize you're asking me if I want to go to Hell, right?" Rosario answered. Emily giggled.
  

  
"It's actually not that bad," she replied.
  

  
"You've been to Hell?" Rosario asked. "Why? What's it like?"
  

  
"It's like any other Earth. Some bad areas, some decent ones," she said. "But, the shopping district is the best you'll find anywhere."
  

  
"Anywhere?" Rosario asked. "Didn't you tell me one time that Sharp Development has the best shopping around?"
  

  
"Yeah," Emily nodded again. "Sharp Development has some amazing Earths dedicated to shopping. But, the district in Hell is just that much better."
  

  
"Really?" Rosario was surprised.
  

  
"Well, yeah," Emily added. "If you think all those other branch Earths are amazing, just imagine how much more impressive Ms. Sharp's home base is."
