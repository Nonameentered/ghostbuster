\[Turbo Tester\] 

Xavier sat in the waiting room and focused on his breathing. In a way, he was glad for the anxiousness; it helped remind him to breathe. The 14-year-old teen had run out of excuses not to be there. An important doctor arrived in town and insisted on giving everyone a checkup. Xavier managed to keep himself busy but now, he was literally the last patient that needed to be seen. The townsfolk took over his chores for the day to make sure he would be checked out. No matter how much he insisted he was fine, everyone insisted it was for the safety of the village. He normally didn't need to breathe; but, he made sure to inhale and exhale every minute or so.
  
 
  
"Xavier Preston?" one of the doors opened and a teenage boy about his age asked for him. Xavier stood up and took in a deep breath for effect. The boy motioned for him to follow. He led Xavier through a  narrow maze and into an exam room. "Please, have a seat," he gestured at the padded table. "My name is Dr. Rad," he added.
  
 
  
"You're the doctor?" Xavier asked as he sat down. "How old are you?" Dr. Rad chuckled and nodded.
  
 
  
"14, same as you," the doctor replied. That put Xavier at ease. He hoped that maybe the young doctor was inexperienced enough to miss the fact that he was actually a living zombie. If nothing else, maybe he could convince him to keep it a secret since they were the same age. Dr. Rad took a step back, then nodded his head. The motion caused a red-translucent visor to appear over his eyes and he moved his head up and down as if studying Xavier.
  
 
  
"Huh," Dr. Rad chuckled; then, he shook his head. The visor disappeared; but, he looked into Xavier's eyes. "What's two plus two?" Dr. Rad asked.
  
 
  
"Four...," Xavier answered.
  
 
  
"What about 10 plus 93?"
  
 
  
"103," Xavier replied.
  
 
  
"What's your favorite number?" Dr. Rad asked.
  
 
  
"21!" he answered. The doctor grinned.
  
 
  
"Mr. Preston, are you aware that you are a zombie?" he asked. Despite the fact that most people would find that shocking, Dr. Rad asked with the same casualness as if he asked the time. Something about the doctor's manner put Xavier at ease enough to give a faint nod. At least, he didn't seem to be in a hurry to get the guardsmen.
  
 
  
"Yes...," Xavier took a chance. "...but I haven't hurt anyone!" he replied. Dr. Rad nodded, then he reached into his pocket.
  
 
  
"I believe you; you're a very interesting case," Dr. Rad replied. He pulled a small glass vial out of his pocket; it held a viscous, green-glowing liquid. 
  
 
  
"Interesting how?" Xavier asked. He already had some idea. Once people were infected they were reduced to reacting on instinct alone. All he got was a faint, sickly green color that was easy enough to hide with long sleeves and a hoodie or play off indoors. It helped that he went out of his way to take the jobs no one wanted.
  
 
  
"I doubt I have to explain that to you," Dr. Rad said. "You already know you're not a normal zombie. "I have some ideas of how it happened; but, I'd need to do some more testing to know for sure," he added.
  
 
  
"Testing? What kind of testing?"
  
 
  
"This kind," Dr. Rad held up the vial to show Xavier. "But, before I explain this, I need to tell you why I'm here," he said. "I came looking for something I could work with; and, I found that in you. You're infected; but, you seem to be immune to a certain extent. I want to infect you with this," he jiggled the vial and shook the liquid inside. It clung to the sides like radioactive dish soap.
  
 
  
"What's that?" Xavier asked.
  
 
  
"It's a modified version of the zombie virus," Dr. Rad answered. "It's Turbo-charged; I need to put it into someone that can remain lucid."  Xavier shook his head and leaned back.
  
 
  
"The world is barely surviving the current zombie outbreak... and you want to add a stronger virus??" he asked.
  
 
  
"Yeah," Dr. Rad nodded. "There's a lot more at stake than any single Earth," he said.
  
 
  
"Huh?" Xavier asked. "What does that mean?" Dr. Rad sighed. He dropped his hand and slipped the vial back into the pocket of his lab coat; but, he kept his hand in there too.
  
 
  
"Well, I won't rush you; it's only fair you get some answers first. Not that I'm the one to give them to you," he said. Dr. Rad pulled his hand back out of his pocket and this time he was holding a dark black card. He promptly threw it at the wall and it opened a tall black portal.
  
 
  
"I'm from an alternate universe," Dr. Rad replied. "There are an infinite number of alternate universes with a different Earth in each one. If you come with me through the portal, I'll take you to Mundo to get the mysteries of the multiverse explained," he said. "But, something changed recently," he paused, then shrugged.
  
 
  
"It feels recent, but honestly, who knows?"
  
 
  
"What do you mean something changed?" Xavier asked. "What changed?"
  
 
  
"The multiverse," Dr. Rad replied. "All of it; it's different than it was."
  
 
  
"What does that have to do with me?" Xavier asked. Dr. Rad pulled the glass vial out again to show it to him.
  
 
  
"This modified virus is created with nanos," the doctor replied. "Nanos are able to Traverse between universes, and I'm hoping with the right modifications, they can move between timelines too," he said. "I want your help to change things back to the way they were."
  
 
  
"I want to help," Xavier believed him. He couldn't explain why, but everything that Dr. Rad said somehow made sense to him. "But, before I take that, I think I need more answers like you promised," he nodded at the portal.
  
 
  
"Happy to," Dr. Rad nodded. He offered Xavier a handshake.
  
 
  
"By the way, you can call me Turbo," he said. Xavier nodded and accepted the greeting. He returned the gesture with a smile.
  
 
  
"My friends call me Xap."
