\[Ace. Shooter.\] 

Ace wasn't ready for the sudden stop. He was moving as fast as he could when he squeezed the trigger. He skated along the deserted city streets when a zombie emerged from an alley and into his path. The gun fired a plume of red smoke and the top half of the zombie burst into flames. The kickback from the gun shoved Ace backward on his behind and off his skates.
  
 
  
The zombie took a step towards Ace while still smoldering, then it disintegrated into a white powder that disappeared. The blonde, curly-haired teen got to his feet as another pair of zombies emerged from the alleyway. He braced himself now that he knew what to expect, and he fired again. Another plume of red smoke ignited the pair of zombies and Ace rushed past them as they disintegrated.
  
 
  
"Not bad," Ace nodded to himself. He split his focus between admiring the black metal shotgun and keeping an eye on the path ahead. He decided to stay on the empty sidewalk instead of trying to get through the permanent gridlock of abandoned cars on the road. He arrived at an intersection with two of the paths blocked off by flaming cars and he was forced to turn left. The path ahead of Ace looked relatively clear. There were no zombies in sight, even if they were likely to pop out of the alley. He slowed his pace to reload the shotgun.
  
 
  
"Let's see what ice can do...," he mumbled to himself as he loaded blue, crystalline shells into the gun. Once it was loaded, he picked up speed again. He sped past the first alley and saw a group of zombies ready to emerge. Ace whirled around on his skates and returned to the opening. He held the gun firm and fired a plume of blue smoke.
  
 
  
The zombie directly in front of him froze from the waist up but the legs kept moving forward. It took a single step, then toppled over and shattered on the sidewalk. Some of the zombies around it had frozen limbs but they kept moving forward unbothered.
  
 
  
"Huh," Ace said. He aimed broader and fired again. He hit more of them with the ice blast. At least, more were covered with ice; but, none of them froze through. The layer of cold did little to slow them down.
  
 
  
"That's useless..," Ace chuckled to himself, then he started skating forward again. The zombies were easy enough to outrun without trying. "...your turn..," he loaded in green shells as he skated towards the next alley. There was only one opening left before he reached the end of the block. He decided to act first his time.
  
 
  
He skated as fast as he could to the opening. He stopped, spun to his right, and then fired. Ace couldn't help but laugh. The lead zombie looked genuinely surprised to see him. His dead eyes widened when the green smoke cleared and the wind picked up around him.  In less than a second, a small tornado lifted several of the zombies off the ground only to drop them again. As they fumbled to their feet, Ace fired again. Another green plume lifted the mass of zombies and tore them apart. The zombie pieces fell to the floor with a wet splat, then they all disintegrated into white powder and disappeared.
  
 
  
"Yeah, I think I like it," Ace grinned to himself. As he watched, another horde of zombies coalesced out of white nanos. "But, I should try it on a few different things..," Ace shrugged. He skated out of the alley and continued to the end of the block. He crossed the street and the shotgun disintegrated from his hand.
  
 
  
He stopped on the other side of the street and flicked his wrist upward to summon his slate. He made some changes on the transparent display, then dismissed it with another flick of his wrist. He walked forward and an old man in a trenchcoat walked out of the apartment building in front of him. He extended his hand and held out a shotgun. Ace grinned as he skated past and took it.
  
 
  
"Here is a shotgun," the man repeated his instructions for the tutorial. "Kill everything that moves!"
