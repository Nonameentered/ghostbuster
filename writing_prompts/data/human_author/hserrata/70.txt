\[Glorious Question\] 

"Alright, I'll take care of it...," Max sighed into the phone. He stopped just outside the diner he was about to enter and took a look up and down the street. It was a quiet Thursday morning downtown with a clear blue sky. There were several shoppers walking around, but not as many as there were on the weekend. And, no one was immediately around him. Then, he spoke aloud with a bored tone. "Caped Mayhem is about to release a deadly plague? What could go wrong with that plan?" He waited for a moment until he felt the telltale tingle at the back of his neck, then the person on the other end thanked him. He slipped the phone back into his pocket and continued into the restaurant.
  
 
  
Max was one of the most powerful heroes in the world; but, only a select few knew it. And, he regretted sharing his abilities with the ones that did. He wanted to be a caped crusader fighting supervillains on the front line. Once they learned he didn't actually have to be near the threat they decided he was too important to risk. Instead, he got labeled an 'Honorary Member' of the Hero's League and was given his own hotline.
  
 
  
They still enjoyed doing their job, the job he wished he could be doing, and only called on him when things were dire. The city would never know how close it came to a plague that day; but, that was his job. No matter how boring it might be. He sat alone in a booth for two and waited. It did not take long for a green-haired waitress to greet him with a smile.
  
 
  
"Mornin'," she said. "Do you need a menu, or do you know what you want?"
  
 
  
"Menu, please," he chuckled at her question. He knew exactly what he wanted; but, it wasn't food.
  
 
  
"Back in a flash," she replied and whirled around. Except, she went straight to another table. It was occupied by an elderly man and a young teenager. Both looked like they hadn't had a meal or clean clothes for a while. The teen girl had the same nose and same curls as the old man and it was easy to guess they were related. The waitress turned and pointed at Max for a moment, then they talked some more. She took their order on her pad, then passed by the hostess station to grab a menu on her way back to Max.
  
 
  
"I hope you don't mind...," she sounded apologetic as she began to explain. She gave him the menu and continued. "I used you as an excuse to give them a free meal. Don't worry about it, you don't have to pay anything extra; but, he wouldn't take it from me. They saw you just come in and I told them the first thing you ordered was to cover someone else's tab. This way they get a warm meal and they think there are other nice people out there too, not just me," she said.
  
 
  
"No...," Max nodded as he answered. He did not want to shake his head to give them the wrong impression. "..I don't mind at all," he said.
  
 
  
"Thanks, you're a doll," the waitress replied. "Let me know when you're ready to order," she pointed at her nametag for effect. "Just yell, 'Gloria'," she said. Then, she left him alone again. Max took a few minutes to check his options and gauge his hunger; then, he decided on the breakfast special.
  
 
  
"Gloria!" he called. He happened to glance at the old man and teen while he yelled. They both turned and waved at him. He smiled and returned the wave while he enjoyed the warmth of their gratitude. "At least I'm a hero to someone," he mumbled to himself as Gloria crossed the restaurant.
  
 
  
"What'll it be?" she asked.
  
 
  
"Mundo's Special," he said. Gloria nodded as she wrote it up on her pad.
  
 
  
"Coffee?" she asked. Max nodded and Gloria was on her way. He got bored after a minute and pulled his phone out for a distraction. It worked for a time; but, after about 10 minutes the phone rang again. The League was calling. He glanced around the mostly empty diner, then answered it.
  
 
  
"Yeah?" he asked. He couldn't help but let out another heavy sigh as the request came in. It was another team in over their heads. "Hold on...," he said. He concentrated, then spoke aloud.
  
 
  
"Caped Mayhem planted seven time-bombs planted around the city?" he asked while rolling his eyes. "What could go wrong with his plan?" But, he noticed Gloria standing by his table with a plate of food and cup of coffee as he asked it. She gave him a curious look as she set the food down; but, she didn't seem overly concerned.
  
 
  
"Okay, bye," Max said once he was given the 'all clear'. He hung up the phone and Gloria was still there.
  
 
  
"You don't seem very concerned about bombs," she said. "So, I'm not either. But, I am curious. What was that about?"
  
 
  
"You wouldn't believe me if I told you," Max sighed. Gloria had already proven herself to be kind-hearted and friendly. Something about her put Max at ease and he was almost willing to share his power with her. He regretted joining the league; but, this was a different situation. The League used him as a catch-all but that was the only time they called him. He was never invited to any functions because it was too risky to be around known league members. He was alone and just wanted some friendliness.
  
 
  
"Oh, I don't know," she grinned. "I've seen my share of 'weird'."
  
 
  
"Alright, why not?" he replied. The worst-case scenario was that she didn't believe him. He would be no worse off; but, he stood to gain a friend at least. "I'm in the Hero's League," he said. She didn't blink and still seemed interested. Superpowers were common enough. "But I'm so powerful that I don't have much to do."
  
 
  
"And what makes you so powerful?" she asked.
  
 
  
"You heard me right now, right?" he asked. "When I asked, 'what could...," he did not finish the statement but she nodded.
  
 
  
"What could go wrong?" she said.
  
 
  
"Right. When I ask that question about something, the universe answers almost immediately."
  
 
  
"So.. there were bombs... but you asked the question and now there aren't?" Gloria asked. Max nodded.
  
 
  
"Well, you're getting a free piece of pie for that," she winked at him.
  
 
  
"You believe me?" he asked. Gloria nodded.
  
 
  
"I told you I'm no stranger to the strange," she said. "What about the other side?" she asked. "How does that work?"
  
 
  
"What?" Max asked. "What other side?" Her smile went flat and she tilted her head at him.
  
 
  
"You mean you haven't thought about it?" she asked. "How long have you had your power?"
  
 
  
"A decade at least," he said. "Trust me, I've tried it all kinds of ways."
  
 
  
"Obviously not," she shook her head. Then, she stepped closer to him and crouched so they were the same height. She nodded at the old man and teen who were thankfully eating and not looking at them.
  
 
  
"Look at them and repeat after me," she said.
  
 
  
"Okay...," Max replied. But, he wasn't ready for what she said. He was embarrassed that it never occurred to him to ask. He heard her; but, he was too stunned to say it right away. It took an extra nudge from Gloria but he sat up straighter and he smiled as he repeated her question.
  
 
  
"What could go right?"
