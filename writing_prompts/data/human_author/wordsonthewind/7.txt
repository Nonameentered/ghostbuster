I adjusted my red mask and gave my bloodstained cloak one last once-over. The literature-themed Halloween party I'd been looking forward to might have been canceled, but I wouldn't let my hard work go to waste. 
  

  
Lisa and her brunch cronies despised inconvenience. The deadly plague ravaging the world and upending everyone's idea of normalcy was no different. Rules had been optional their whole lives and nothing would change now. Not when money, influence, and sheer boneheaded stubbornness smoothed their way so often. 
  

  
They grouped up. They called it a "pod" which suited them down to the ground because they were all determined to be as alike as possible. They boasted about the careful vetting process to join, but in practice it was all about how well they knew you beforehand. Following safety guidelines didn't come into it. 
  

  
They flaunted their hairstyles and manicures over social media while mocking everyone else for living in fear. While I struggled to convince my boss that I wasn't slacking off just because I worked at home, they had high teas every other day and hinted at secret germ-breathing parties. They didn't call it that, but I knew what they meant.  
  

  
The party was supposed to celebrate the end of the lockdown. When it was extended, I resigned myself to using my Red Death costume next year. Then I saw Lisa's post.
  

  
*We've been living in fear all year*, she wrote. *Let's have FUN this Halloween! Cool people ONLY. Bring wine. NO SHEEPLE!!!!!*
  
 
  
So I got out my Red Death costume and headed for the house on the hill. 
  

  
But a few feet away from their backyard, I stopped in my tracks. 
  

  
The figure in front of me looked exactly like the hospital patients I'd seen on the news, the ones who'd been hit hard by the virus and were struggling to breathe. They wore a blue hospital gown and very little else. Their glazed eyes were the only visible part of their face. If someone else had the same idea I had, with a much more topical costume, I would never forgive them. But I wanted to shake their hand.
  

  
The figure put a finger to their lips, or the place their lips would be without their mask. They shooed me away. 
  

  
*Turn around,* that gesture conveyed. *Go home.*
  

  
I didn't want to give up on my idea for an epic prank, but then they coughed. A loud hacking cough followed by a wheezing inhale.
  

  
I backed away as fast as I could, then broke into a sprint. If this crazy person wanted to infect everyone in that house, I wouldn't stop them. But I couldn't afford to get sick. I was all out of leave days.
  

  
Lisa and her friends all got sick in the next few weeks. Of course they did. It was the very definition of a superspreader event, based on their photos. 
  

  
What really puzzled me, though, was that they never mentioned a masked figure crashing their party.
