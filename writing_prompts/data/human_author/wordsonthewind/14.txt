My home was scoured from existence eons ago. But here in the ruins, we remain. We live, after a fashion. We make do.
  

  
Where we once stood upright, now we lay flat on the ground, tunneling through the soil. I grew used to the taste and feel of dirt in my mouth. We used to crawl somewhat, dragging ourselves along the ground, but we soon grew tired of that. There was nothing to see and nowhere to go in the dark. Better to remain still and prone to conserve energy.
  

  
Our enemies thought to put us in the ground but our spirits are strong. Stronger than anything they could bring to bear. 
  

  
On the far side of the moon, beyond the range of your telescopes, there is an empty city where nothing grows. Once we thrived there in the billions. But then the war broke out. We had no other choice.
  

  
Sometimes my mother reaches out to me. I know she would hold my hand if she could but her fingers were crushed into uselessness in the initial hostilities. I want to tell her that I love her but the earth had long since crushed all but the thinnest of breaths out of my lungs. 
  

  
I settle for brushing my fingers against hers instead. 
  

  
We are still alive in here. There is air to sustain us, saturated in the midst of all the earth. We just can't move in it. 
  

  
We will endure. We will outlast everything else that wants to end us. And when we are the only ones left in the whole universe, we will rise again.
