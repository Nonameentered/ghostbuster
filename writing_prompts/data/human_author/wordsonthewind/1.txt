Hi London! Wow, what a sombre piece. You characterized all three grieving friends well. Their differing responses to the war as well as how they coped with the loss of their friend came through well in their dialogue. Mac's morbid jokes stood out in particular. Good job!

I think these two lines felt a bit like they were just restating things that had just been established in the preceding dialogue. They could be replaced with other ways to show their emotion, like a description of their movements. Just an example off the top of my head. 

These are my thoughts. I hope this helps!
