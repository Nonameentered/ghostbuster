Karen made enemies everywhere she went. It was infuriating. Customer service reps rolled their eyes or sighed when they thought she didn't notice. Waitresses ignored her even when she was the only customer in their section. No, worse than that: she could be the only customer in the whole restaurant and they'd still ignore her. 
  

  
It was happening now. If the service crew had somehow become blind and deaf in the last hour, Karen would eat her handbag.
  

  
But they looked past her. They busied themselves with inanities like wiping down countertops. When she snapped her fingers, the stupid girl who had taken her order never even looked up. 
  

  
Karen poked through the remains of her meal. She'd ordered a medium steak, but this restaurant clearly hired culinary-school dropouts. One look at the raw center and pinkish blood and she'd sent it back to the kitchen. It returned with the consistency of her handbag and a taste that probably wasn't much further off, but at least it was properly cooked. 
  
 
  
She found what she was looking for. A strand of hair. 
  

  
The manager hadn't gone blind and deaf like the rest of his staff. But his first words to her weren't promising.
  

  
"Make it quick, we're all busy at closing time."
  

  
Karen thrust the hair in his face. What was the use of all this cleaning if they couldn't stop hair from getting in her food? It was unhygienic, and unprofessional of the servers to bully a paying customer. Her meal needed to be comped. 
  

  
"It looks like your hair, ma'am."
  

  
Oh, she wouldn't let him get away with this. "Are you saying I'm a liar?"
  

  
"I'm saying no one here has dyed hair," he replied. "It's against company policy."
  

  
She looked around. The only head of hair with a perm and red highlights was her own.
  

  
"What about the chefs?" she demanded. 
  

  
"They all have buzzcuts, ma'am," the manager said. It would have been less mocking if he'd smirked. 
  

  
"This is unbelievable," she fumed. "What does it take to get good service around here? Everywhere I go I'm treated like I'm worse than nothing just because I can't throw money around to get people kissing my ass—"
  

  
"With all due respect, ma'am," the manager said. "If it smells like shit everywhere you go—"
  

  
*"Unbelievable,"*  Karen snarled as she stormed out.
  

  
So this place hired skinheads and had no qualms at all about insulting its customers. Karen would never in a million years dream of telling her clients they smelled bad, but this jumped-up busboy did it without a second thought.
  

  
She wouldn't pay a single cent. She'd escalate this up the chain as far as she had to. It wasn't about the money. It was about making them understand that this kind of subpar service was unacceptable. 
  

  
She was no stranger to battles like these. She fought, and if she lost, at least they wouldn't win.
