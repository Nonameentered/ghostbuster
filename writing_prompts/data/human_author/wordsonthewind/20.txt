Hi Lee! I enjoyed this tale of a demon summoning with unexpected results. The lorem ipsum detail was hilarious, and the ending was a nice anticlimax. Al's nonchalant manner really deflated the tense atmosphere of his entrance in the best way possible. Great job!

I do think this could have been broken up a bit though. There's quite a bit going on here (Al waving as he leaves, the brothers' reactions, the state of the house) which stretches out the anticlimax. I feel like ending with the unexpectedly chill monster simply leaving would have closed the anticlimax on a stronger note. 

Good words!
