Alright, let's see

>		1.	How did you arrive at your username? Is there any special story behind it?

Yes, but it's not a very happy one. Let's just say I found the name too pretty to let go of despite the not-so-happy reasons for choosing it, and decided to work towards giving it a new meaning. 

>		2.	Do you have any overarching goals for your writing? ie. is it a hobby, a main creative outlet, do you want to write full-time, do you need to see your books in a bookstore someday, etc?

I'd like to get a regular income from writing fiction someday, whether I make it into bookstores or not. 

>		3.	I notice a lot of your stories are written in first person. Do you ever experiment with other viewpoints?

Well now I gotta write some stories in third-person

In all seriousness, I suspect it's partly because a lot of prompts here are written in second-person. "Your supervillain arch-nemesis is your roommate!?!?" And I tend to see the prompts as questions to answer, so I default to first-person in my responses. Off Reddit I use third-person a bit more. 

I can't say why I use first or third-person for any particular story though. If I had to guess, I think I use first-person for characters with personalities and/or experiences similar to mine, and also characters with unusual perspectives where I think it might be fun to get inside their heads. Everyone else ends up in third-person.
