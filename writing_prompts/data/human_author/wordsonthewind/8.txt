Hi Xack! This was amusing. If Jerry's costumes are this good it's no wonder he's late every year! I can't imagine how much time it would take to get into one of those things. 

I appreciated a lot of the descriptions in this piece. The visceral details of Jerry's costume using multiple senses, of course, but also the disgruntled woman's hair looking like a "shellacked chicken tail". It made for an unusual and striking mental image. 

I think I would have liked to see more of the children's reactions though. Right now they're just getting shoved and dragged around, and so in my mind they're just kind of there. This part

>	“Are you sure? Because they look pretty- “

does make it sound like they're already a little scared, but I feel like a little detail about their behavior in the moment would make all the difference. "They're scared of the haunted house's ambience and the horror movie trio" isn't quite the same as "they're scared of their mother being a Karen and making a scene", after all. 

Good words!
