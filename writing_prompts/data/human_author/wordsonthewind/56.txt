Hi Dee! This was a sad and lovely piece. The second-person narration was an interesting choice to put us right inside the main character's perspective. It really added to the vividness of their sadness and regrets.

This part wasn't really necessary, IMO. I think the sentence before it would have ended the story on a much stronger note. 

Good words!
