I loved the characterization in this piece, both of Chef Paul and the narrator giving instructions. Paul’s perfectionism and exacting standards came through in the many rules the new chef is expected to follow, and the narrator clearly has a tendency to go with the flow and make the best they can out of a bad situation.

Comma should probably go before ‘but’

Nice work overall!
