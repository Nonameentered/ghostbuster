Hi Xack! This was a great slice-of-life piece. You portrayed the little miscommunications and unstated assumptions in these kinds of exchanges really well. Using dialogue-only really helped with that harried feeling. 

>	“He’s…I… He’s cleaning the gutters in the closet!?”

That first bit of stuttering could've been cut, IMO. It would put more emphasis on the closet part of the sentence which I think is where the main humor lies in this part. The various absurd things in the closet. 

Good words!
