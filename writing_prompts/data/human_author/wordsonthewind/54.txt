All the good horror novels were gone by the time Rhea arrived at Turn a New Old Page, leaving only the second-best picks to choose from in loading up her bicycle.
  

  
She made her selections quickly. Anything with a scantily-clad woman on the front was out. Any book where the author's name was bigger than the actual title was out. She chose six of the books that remained, then went to the cash register to pay.
  

  
"Thanks for taking these off my hands," Laurent said. He'd grown up in Nice before coming to Mount Raleigh, and the accent had never entirely worn off. It was one of the reasons she kept coming back here. The fact that it was a second-hand bookshop and therefore the only one in this town that hadn't had half its space overtaken by stationery, educational toys, or an entire cafe helped too. 
  

  
"No trouble at all," Rhea said. "I'll be back next week to check out your other books."
  

  
"Of course." Laurent nodded. "I'll remember that when I'm ordering my stock. What would you like to read about? Maybe I should get some thrillers next, hmm?"
  

  
Rhea laughed. "I'll let you know."
  

  
She'd brought a cloth bag for her first few visits, but by now she was an old hand at holding books under her arm. They fit snugly into the basket mounted to the front of her bicycle. She undid the lock, put up the kickstand and was off within moments. 
  

  
The leaves crunched under the wheels of her bicycle as she made her way home. It was a fine start to her reading list for the fall, if she did say so herself. And the ride home would work up a nice appetite for her breakfast later.
  

  
She put the books away as she walked through the front door, then boiled water in the kitchen. Only when it was good and salted did she add the eggs.                                                                              
  

  
Poached eggs and a piece of toast. That was her meal every morning and she didn't see any reason to change that with the seasons. Her green sweater was a constant in her wardrobe as well. It kept her warm in all seasons and that was all there was to it as far as she was concerned.
  

  
She wasn't bitter. Her parents never seemed to understand that. There was nothing wrong about how her life had turned out as far as she was concerned. The job she'd moved halfway across the country to take hadn't panned out, and her boyfriend had bailed on her forcing her to rent a smaller place. But she had a routine and she had her books.
  

  
This was everything she'd ever wanted.
