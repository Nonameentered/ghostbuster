Hi Ginger! Great (and morbid) take on the theme! I liked the character development the main character goes through, from reluctance to eat someone to glorying in her nature. I would have appreciated a bit more time showing the narrator's acceptance of eating humans, after the first half of the story went into quite a bit of detail about her doubts. 

The description of the feast was great too. Good words!
