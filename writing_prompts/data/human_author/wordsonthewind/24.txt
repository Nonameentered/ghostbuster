I heard Donny's wailing before his parents reached the information counter. The boy was inconsolable. Cheeks red with exertion, he flailed wildly, batting at his father's chest. 

"He's lost his bandana." His mother raised her voice to be heard over the shrieks. "Please, could you check lost-and-found? We've looked everywhere..."

My manager had ideas on how to handle crying children. I was supposed to talk to them in a sweet high voice and distract them with gift shop goodies. But one look at Donny's striped navy-blue shirt and the anchor patch on his pants told me it was hopeless. The boy wanted his special pirate bandana. Nothing else would do. 

The bandana wasn't in the lost-and-found box. Nobody used it anyway, so that didn't surprise me. 

"Where did you last see it?" I asked them. 

His father answered this time. "The central wing, I think? There were floor-to-ceiling glass tanks. Donny wanted to see the octopus."

His mother nodded. 

I took out my walkie-talkie and radioed a brief description of the lost bandana to my colleagues. Then there was nothing to do but wait. 

Suddenly, my walkie-talkie crackled to life. 

"There's a trail of water leading to the tanks," John said. "And Ollie just floated past wearing something that looked awfully familiar."

We rushed to the central wing. Sure enough, Ollie the Octopus was there, bandana wound around one of his tentacles, looking no worse for wear for his brief time on land. 

"Donny, meet your new, uh..." I racked my brain for the appropriate terminology. "First mate?"

Donny stared, transfixed. 

"How about we choose a new captain's bandana for you from the gift shop, huh?" his mother said. 

Donny nodded. 

His father sighed. "Guess we'll be here every weekend now."

I smiled. "That's great, sir. Ollie loves visitors."
