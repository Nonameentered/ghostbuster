No one else in Wu's neighborhood knew about the teahouse in the wood behind the park, and he was determined to keep it that way. 

The place was tranquil. It served tea and refreshments in the traditional way, and he was never bothered unless he wanted the company. When he first stumbled across the teahouse he would strike up conversations with whoever sat down beside him, but in time he simply ran out of things to say. Nobody sat by him after that. 

Sometimes he was the only one in the shop, but he never minded. Sometimes he couldn't find the place at all. He would go back to the park and retrace his steps exactly, but only arrive at a tiny clearing instead. Most shops and cafes didn't do that, he was sure, but it didn't matter so much. The teahouse was always there when he really needed it.

This visit was one of the better ones as far as Wu was concerned. The only other person in here was the teahouse owner, and that man had never once been the first to speak. Which was fine. That just made it easier for Wu to disappear into the silence. 

He'd wanted that for as long as he could remember. The only way forward was to endure. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, as the old saying went. And yet...

*A bird sharpening its beak on a high mountain will grind stone to dust.*

He wouldn't write that down. It was cliche, not worth using the pen and paper which the owner of this shop had generously set out for him. 

He liked haiku. It was something he'd taken up recently; right around the time he'd discovered the teahouse, come to think of it. He would often write as he lingered over his cup of tea. 

He lived an orderly life. He did his best to get along in the world outside, then came here to relax and restore his carefully maintained equilibrium. It was a simple plan, perfectly executed. 

If only the world didn't keep getting in the way.

"Peace is hard to find," he murmured to himself. "A ripple in a still pond, disturbing rhythm."

The bell at the door tinkled. A new customer had found the shop. 

It was pouring outside, rain lashing against the bedraggled young man who opened the door of the teahouse. And yet, as soon as he'd closed it behind him, the sun shone through its windows once again. 

"Do you have coffee?"

The shop owner frowned. "We specialize in tea, but I'll see what I can do." 

Wu stared. He recognized the boy, by his voice if nothing else. The screaming arguments he had with his parents were a familiar sound from the house next door. Wu had long since lost count of how many times his peaceful evening was interrupted by that boy's refusal to respect his elders. 

And now he'd taken a seat in Wu's sanctuary, sipping on some green concoction. 

"This is..." The boy made a face. "Chai-flavored coffee?"

The owner looked nonplussed. "It's a chai latte, right?"

"That's tea!"

"Oh." The owner looked crestfallen. "I'm sorry. I thought it was a coffee."

"Noâ€“" The boy frowned. "I mean, yes. You did give me coffee, even if it tastes like tea, so..."

Wu had wondered at first why the boy was here, intruding on this special place of his. But now a thought occurred to him as he watched his neighbor hunch over his cup of coffee and begin sipping tentatively at it. 

He was just like Wu. Not wanting company, preferring to linger over his own drink. 

Maybe this sanctuary was big enough for them both after all.
