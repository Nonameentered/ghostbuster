The boathouse at St Anne's was haunted. Everyone knew this. No one, however, could agree on what it was haunted *by.*

Hence the Ouija board. It was necessary, but it was an *Ouija board*. That was like playing with fire. And they'd snuck out after curfew, so they were playing with fire in more ways than one. 

"Who would even haunt this mess?" Liz said as she set up the planchette. 

"The custodian?" Geri suggested, sheltering the candles with her hands. 

"Only because this is where he stashes all his equipment and cleaning supplies," Liz replied. "Because no one ever goes here. Except Lucia." 

The boathouse was Lucia's history project. She'd collected stories. Pranks gone wrong competed with murder and melodrama fit for a daytime soap. None of them matched the town's archives going back hundreds of years. 

A primary source was her only remaining option.

The girls placed their hands on the planchette.

"Who are you?" Geri called out 

The planchette moved.

*DROWNED. KNEW TOO MUCH*

Liz's eyes widened.

"You were murdered," she breathed. "I knew it! Tell us more. We'll help you-"

Geri shushed her.

*CHAPEL*

Lucia frowned. "If they hid your body in the chapel, why are you here?"

The planchette jerked.

*NO*

*IF YOU KNOW TOO MUCH. IT COMES.*

Lightning illuminated the whole cabin for a moment, revealing dozens of pale ghosts crammed into every available space like sardines. All of them were facing the chapel. 

The girls were drenched when they got back to their rooms. Lucia lost her notes. All three of them lost weekend excursion privileges for the next few weeks. But getting caught in the worst storm the town had experienced in five years could have gone a lot worse. 

Getting caught by the thing in the chapel didn't bear thinking about.
