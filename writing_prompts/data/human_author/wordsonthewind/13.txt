Hi Crystal! Premature burial is a horror trope that will never die. I love what you did with it! The descriptions of the narrator being trapped in the coffin and then digging their way out were really vivid. Their panic came across nicely. Good job!

I'd have liked to see a bigger emotional reaction to finally clawing their way out of their own grave. The ending was hilarious of course; still, I can't help but notice...

>	I must have been knocked out, for… how long? Long enough that I’m now considered dead at least. 

...the narrator doesn't actually know how long they were unconscious. Maybe they really are a zombie! I feel like it's a possibility. Well done on the ambiguity if it was intentional.

Good words!
