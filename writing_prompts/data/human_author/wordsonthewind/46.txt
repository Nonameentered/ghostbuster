It was fairly new into their relationship, but Joyce didn't care about that. This was the first Valentine's Day she'd ever spent with someone and she had to impress. Nina hated crowds and had no use for flowers, but everyone loved chocolate. She was an amazing cook, so Joyce had a standard to live up to.
  

  
She took the chocolate squares out of the oven. They crumbled to pieces as soon as she poked them with a fork. It made for a sad contrast next to the box and wrapping she'd purchased at the bakery the week before. 
  

  
"No," she whispered. The baking had gone so smoothly for once. Her little brother Nate hadn't wandered into the kitchen looking for snacks or entertainment. She'd checked and double-checked that she had all the ingredients, and then followed the recipe exactly. Why had all her efforts literally crumbled to pieces?
  

  
Despondent, she swiped at the tray with a finger and brought some of the pieces to her mouth. Too sweet! She would have remembered adding that much sugar, she was sure.
  

  
"Nate!" She called now. "Get in here!"
  

  
After a few minutes, Nate shuffled in. He didn't look sheepish like she was expecting him to. He looked pleased with himself instead, even slightly proud. 
  

  
"Well, sis?" He smiled innocently. "How did it go?"
  

  
"It was a disaster, that's what it was!" She held out the tray to him. "Look at what happened to my chocolate squares!"
  

  
He did a double-take as he looked at the brown crumbs that covered the tray. "I mean, you could tell him it's chocolate crumble? Or use it in a cake?"
  

  
Joyce shook her head. "I'm not great at this. I only tried baking these squares because it was the only recipe that looked simple enough not to screw up. Now I'll have to settle for store-bought Godiva chocolate like everyone else."
  

  
Nate blinked. "Wait, these were- these were for Nina?"
  

  
At Joyce's despondent nod, his face fell. "Oh no... I'm sorry!"
  

  
"What did you do, Nate?"
  

  
His brow furrowed. "I... added more sugar? I was just trying to improve the recipe."
  

  
"Oh, Nate." Joyce sighed, all her anger gone. "You can improvise in cooking, but baking is a science. Following the recipe matters more."
  

  
Nate's hands twitched towards the remaining crumbs and she lightly swatted them away. "First of all, you're searching up simple cupcake recipes. Then we'll use these crumbs to dust them when we're done. And if you help me out well enough, I'll let you sneak a few before I box these up for Nina."
  

  
Nate nodded. "Sure thing, sis."
