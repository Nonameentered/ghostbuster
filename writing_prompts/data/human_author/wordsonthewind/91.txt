#####Soli Deo Gloria

My room and possessions were gifts from my parents. Everything else was a gift from God. 

I studied hard to get the best grades in class, and my teachers got thank-you cards for their hard work. Other classmates who did well bragged about the toys and family vacations they were rewarded with. I asked my parents once if we could go to the diner for burgers and shakes to celebrate my latest straight-A report card. That was the only time I ever asked. 

"Envy is a deadly sin," they said. "So is gluttony. And they all come from the same place. Remember: *Soli Deo gloria!*"

*Glory to God alone.* I didn't understand back then, but now I do. The list of seven deadly sins is really six branches and one root. Destroy a plant's roots and every branch on it withers. Everything my parents did was for my sake. They only wanted to protect me.  

I wish I could thank them properly, but they forgot their motivation long ago. One day my father simply announced that we wouldn't attend our usual church anymore. He took us from parish to parish in the following months until we just stopped going entirely. They took classes instead, went to dinners and parties with friends. They indulged in everything they had once condemned as a frivolous waste of time. 

They went back into the world just as I was ready to leave it behind. You would almost think they'd have preferred to learn I was pregnant out of wedlock instead of planning to become a nun. 

"I've been through discernment," I told them the last time we talked. "I'm certain. This is what God has called me to do."

My mother frowned. She'd long since replaced her crucifix necklace with a diamond one, but she never needed religion to wield her disapproval like a club. "Can't He call someone else?"

"You're young," my father said. "Do you really want to spend the best years of your life locked inside a convent? You can serve God just as well by marrying and having children. Why do you have to be so extreme?"

"It's not about what I want," I said. I felt calmer than I ever had in my life, and that was how I knew I was doing the right thing. "It's about what God wants. You're the extreme ones if you think you can dictate to Him."

They were wrong, anyway. The nuns in my order don't just seclude themselves in a cell. Now I teach at an all-girls' boarding school. It feels like the natural extension of my calling. 

I learned humility well as a child. It is the virtue that counters the root of all sin. Now, with my guidance, the many young ladies in my care will learn humility just as I did. Only then will they be free.
