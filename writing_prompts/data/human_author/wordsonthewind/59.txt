Excellent punchline! I appreciated Michael's characterization too. His irreverent remarks and little shows of disdain portrayed his skepticism effectively. 

I have to say, I don't quite understand the sequence of events here:

>	She rose, dripping, to applause.

all the way to

>	He looked up to see the young woman emerging from the creek.

It reads like she emerged from the water twice to me. Shouldn't he have already seen the way her robe clung to her? Kind of feels like the crowd should've reacted to that earlier too. 

These are my thoughts. I hope this helps!
