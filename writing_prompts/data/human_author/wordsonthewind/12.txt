Hi Fye! Wow, this was chilling. I appreciated the way you set the scene with the descriptions of the surroundings. The branches and nettles in the first half and the brief mention of the logger's axe in the second half added a nice tinge of danger to their respective situations. The twist at the end was foreshadowed nicely with Colin's thoughts at the funeral and the reveal was well-placed too. Excellent job!

I think this sentence could have been broken up or cut a bit, just to increase the impact of her pursuer catching up to her. Just my two cents. 

Good words!
