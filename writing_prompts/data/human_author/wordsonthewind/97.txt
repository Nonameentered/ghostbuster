I like those mood music playlists on YouTube. The more oddly specific the title the better. If a song has lyrics I usually end up stuck on the words pretty quickly, so if it's a music prompt or something I just use it to set the scene in my head. 

I get stuck on the music as well but it takes longer. So I have a playlist on when I start but turn it off after a while. I'm not sure how this affects my writing.
