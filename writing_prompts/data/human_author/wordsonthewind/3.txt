Don't be too harsh on Past You. They were doing their best with what they had, I'm sure! 

For what it's worth I never get mad at Past Me for typos, weird nonsense or just plain dross. Typos can be corrected, weird nonsense can be dredged for gems, dross can just be removed. But I can't edit a draft that doesn't exist. Why would Past Me stick me with this impossible task? 

But I'm sure they were doing their best too. Good luck with Nano!
