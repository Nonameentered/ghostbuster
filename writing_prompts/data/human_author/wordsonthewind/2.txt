Hi Xack! This was amazing. I really enjoyed the way you committed to the premise of a war between clowns and mimes and showed us all the weapons and tricks they used in battle. The mime field with its invisible ropes and walls was a striking image. Also an incredible pun. Great job!

I don't have much in the way of crit this time. Aside from this

>	It is Zoopy the Zopper who scattered the enemy

The other two sentences paying tribute to him were in past tense ("It was Zoopy the Zopper who...") so this felt out of place to me. It might be better to write this in past tense as well. 

Good words!
