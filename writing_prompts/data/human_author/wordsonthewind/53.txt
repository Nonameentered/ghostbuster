I've written in hotel rooms, on public transport... Recently I tried a workspace booth. There was a desk with a swivel chair, a power outlet, and free wifi. Plus Bluetooth speakers built into the walls. Everything I needed to set up my laptop and a writing playlist. 

Gotta say it felt a little weird to basically lock myself inside a giant plastic box, but it had everything I needed. And not much else. I think I could focus better in there compared to some of the other places I've written in. At least until a few curious passers-by started rapping on the walls
