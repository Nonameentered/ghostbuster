The tower appeared yesterday on the outskirts of my neighborhood. I wasn't surprised; I'd seen it in my dreams on and off for years on end. 

It loomed large against the oncoming storm that always haunted my nightmares. It was a beacon of neon, a herald of disappearances and endings. Against a bleak overcast sky, it promised shelter and revels beyond imagination. Each time, I would walk past the jugglers and games in the grass outside, past the attractions on each successive floors, until I reached the top of the tower and the only door on the floor. I always woke up before I could see what was on the other side.

I had no idea why I was being visited by these visions of the tower. I had no interest in the occult. Dark forces were realer than anyone these days wanted to believe. Nothing good could come from meddling with those powers, I was sure of it. 

No one else in town understood my perspective. All they saw was a haunting kaleidoscope, teasing visions of resplendence and wonder. Nothing could stop the celebrations.

Everyone lost their minds as soon as they caught sight of the dancers. They abandoned their responsibilities. They invited the performers into their homes. My sister smiled as she introduced me to a dancer, hanging off his arm all the while.

And as the people I'd grown up with and known my whole life ate the food on offer, they changed as well. Their lips crusted over with sugar from the candy apples they snacked on. They laughed and danced in the streets, but the light in their eyes was gone. 

I must be the last person unchanged in this town by now. The streets are quiet and still when I look out my window. Only the tower blooms with color and life. 

But I am never leaving. I will always choose cold harsh reality over all the merciful dreams in the world.
