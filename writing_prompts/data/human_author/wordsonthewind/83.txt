To share my family's special chicken soup    
I should list its ingredients    
and the journey of those ingredients    
added by each generation in turn    
and the journey of each generation    
each step they took paving the road I walked    
leading to    
this day    
this afternoon    
this moment    
where I create their soup once more.  

This is what I think:    
the world is full of stories.    
Each dish on my blog contains countless histories    
and will feature in countless more    
I simply show you your place in the web.    
But if you wish to strike out on your own    
denying any connection to those who have come before,    
I will set you on a path.   

You will need:    
Chicken,    
tomatoes,    
potatoes,    
carrots,    
garlic,    
a little onion,    
slightly more salt  

Here is what I do:    
slice up the chicken    
set the pieces in a medium saucepan of water to boil    
drain the water    
boil the chicken once more    
add the other ingredients and simmer    
add salt to taste and serve  

Here is what you will do:    
with this barest of basics,    
find your own way.    
The rest is up to you.
