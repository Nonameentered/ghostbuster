She approached me as I stood in line for the roller-coaster. 
  

  
"Pick a card," she said. "Any card."
  

  
I took in her moon-patterned shawl and flowing getup, and breathed a sigh of relief. I hated card tricks. 
  

  
"Aren't you supposed to have a tent and gaze into a crystal ball or whatever?" I asked as I drew a card from the tarot deck.
  

  
She scoffed. "Not me. I go where the fortunes must be told."
  

  
I turned my card over. *Death.* 
  

  
"That's everyone's future, isn't it?" I said. "You won't scare me so easily." 
  

  
But she shook her head when I tried to return it to her.
  

  
"It came to you for a reason," she said. 
  

  
She moved on to the people further down. The yells and cries of outrage began soon after.
  

  
"Is this a joke?"
  

  
"That's creepy..."
  

  
"What kind of tarot deck only has one card?"
  

  
"Don't blame me." Her voice rose above the crowd. "It's everyone's future, isn't it?" 
  

  
But I was looking at my card. The background was a vague color gradient at first, but I realized it was gradually resolving. It looked uncannily like a fair. One with a wooden roller-coaster. 
  

  
I looked at the roller-coaster, considered my place in the queue, and then left. That rickety deathtrap was probably over-hyped anyway.
