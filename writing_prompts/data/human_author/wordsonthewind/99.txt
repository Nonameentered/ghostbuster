Hi Bard! I enjoyed the imagery and worldbuilding in this piece, especially when you showed the wailer in action. It was an evocative snapshot of a more magical New York. 

I get the impression that Ned was influenced by the wailer long before he ever faced it. Thinking that it should be left alone because "they were not evil, they simply were", coming up with excuses to avoid a confrontation. The wailer's behavior when we finally see it doesn't match up with that IMO. It felt like it was doing what it did deliberately instead of just being too supernatural/magical for mortals to go unharmed around it, I suppose. 

These are my thoughts. I hope this helps!
