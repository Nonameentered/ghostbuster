A poem! It tells quite a heartwarming story. I liked the portrayal of their first encounter. 

I also appreciated the attempt at meter. This line confused me though 

>	She yelled objections: sought and brought.

Does this mean there were others (in court or otherwise) who agreed with her and didn't want to go to war? The next few lines mention the courts laughing at her fears so I wasn't sure. 

Good words!
