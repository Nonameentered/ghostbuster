Azlack smelled it before he felt the pull of summoning. The scent of lavender incense. It reminded him of the flowers in the fields back home a lifetime ago. 

Limbo wasn't much to write home about. Even for a hero, marked by prophecy and singled out by fate, who'd saved the world from demonic incursion. There were no lovely fields to frolic in or endless luxuries or indulgences. Everyone was equal in death and that meant featureless plains in dense fog where the dead could sink into reverie, endlessly reliving past glories. 

Unless the living summoned them.

The summoning yanked him forward like he was being pulled on a string. But if he was tied to a string, he could use that to find his way.

So Azlack walked onward and upward, following the call of the summoning, until he emerged into the world of the living once more.

He was standing in a summoning circle. And his summoner looked more than a little vexed.

"How did you-?" She asked, before shaking her head. "No, I'm doing this out of order. You stand before Aveline Celestris, mageborn and chosen of the Golden Prince. State your name, shade."

"I am Azlack, once known as Fateguard," he said. "Deposer of Armin Kesedar and his demonic allies, and the first king of-"

"The Hero of Light, yes." She didn't look any less vexed. "You're... not what I expected."

He looked at his clothes. "This was everyday attire back home. The bright colors and patterns were thought to bring good luck. They became rarer after Kesedar's forces burned the place to the ground."

"That's not what I meant," Aveline said. "Where's your demonbane sword? Your blessed armor?"

"They belonged to the Hero of Light," Azlack replied. "They have no place in the land of the dead."

"But you are the Hero ofâ€“"

He gestured to himself. "Do you really think I see myself as the Hero of Light? If you knew enough to invoke me with the flowers of my hometown, I don't see why my hometown's clothes would surprise you."

Aveline frowned. "They are the flowers of the kingdom. The kingdom that rose after you united the scattered warring regions to rise against Kesedar and the demons from the Realm-in-Shadow."

"I know my own history, Aveline Celestris," Azlack said. "They didn't follow me because I had a magic sword or because destiny said so. They chose to follow me because, after I finally reached the point where I knew I had to become involved or shut up, I was willing to help them negotiate with one another. To find common ground. And we had one hell of that in our common enemy."

Aveline nodded slowly to herself. "It's not enough to be a rallying point. They need someone to rally against too?"

"I'm not young enough to know everything," Azlack replied. "That's up to you."

Aveline smiled. "You have given me much to ponder upon, once-Hero of Light. You may return to the Limbo from whence you came."

The circle filled with the scent of lavender and Azlack's world dissolved around him.
