Hi Dee! Good words for a first venture into horror. The suspense as Nadia jumps at every sound and shadow was conveyed well. The monster was also pretty effectively depicted with just a few descriptive details. Icy breath and cold slimy claws...

My main quibble is about the monster. The invisible wall felt out of place to me when the rest of it seems to be of the "stalks you and kills you horribly" persuasion. Maybe it's because I feel like horror monsters work best as extensions/symbols of the protagonist's inevitable doom though (no gore for gore's sake), and I didn't see how Nadia's struggle to make ends meet leads into "getting stalked and killed horribly". Just my personal philosophy of horror. 

These are my thoughts. I hope this helps!
