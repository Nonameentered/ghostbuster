Hi wiley! I liked the narrator's voice in this piece. Getting Count of Monte Cristo vibes from his vow to utterly ruin her for the sake of his vengeance. The repetition of "I won't ever forgive her" and shift to "I won't ever forgive myself" was good too. 

>	I would do far more to eliminate the threat she posed, the poison on the grounds of my fertile family tree, ripe and unripe fruit left to shrivel all the same unpicked on the vines.

This but felt awkward to me. I think it's because it shifted partway through from talking about the woman to her effects on the narrator's family ("ripe and unripe fruit" onwards). It might have been better to restructure the sentence a bit, maybe break it up into separate parts. 

These are my thoughts. I hope this helps!
