The house was in a sleepy, out-of-the-way part of town, but I needed the peace and quiet. Besides, the owner had accepted my offer right away, no questions asked.  
  

  
"I just want to move on," he said. 
  

  
I called a home inspector. The report came back clean, so I signed the paperwork, collected the keys and hired the movers. By the end of the week I was settled in my new home. 
  

  
I spotted the extra door then. It had gone unnoticed and unmentioned, but it was there now, a second back door that had no right to exist. 
  

  
I tried the handle and stepped into my backyard, under a gray sky tinged orange and yellow by the sunrise.
  

  
It had been nighttime moments ago. 
  

  
The first door was locked. I let myself out through the front gate instead. Lost in thought, I barely heard the insistent ringing of the newspaper boy's bicycle. 
  

  
I jumped aside with seconds to spare. He tossed a rolled-up newspaper outside my fence and whizzed past, not bothering to return and fix his mistake. 
  

  
It wasn't mine; I preferred having the news read to me. I picked it up to toss it on my neighbor's porch where it belonged.
  

  
The paper was dated August 2nd, 2004. One day ago.
  

  
I hoped for do-overs. Each day I stepped through the extra door and lived the previous day again. Hindsight is 20/20, as they say. Now I had a chance to put it into practice.  
  

  
But my world never changed. I could choose differently and watch the result, but the moment I stepped back inside none of that mattered. It was like I'd never gone through all. 
  

  
I began using it as my personal time-loop. I said the witty comebacks that had popped into my head far too late the first time. I had that extra coffee on the way home. I was living each day twice now. What was the harm in little indulgences and petty cruelties that were erased from history anyway?
  

  
The day the extra door opened from the other side, I understood why the previous owner had sold the house so quickly.
  

  
Another me entered. He didn't walk. He came barreling at me, his arms akimbo. I matched him blow for blow as best as I could, but he had the element of surprise. And I was never the best at improv.
  

  
"Now I know how selfish you are!" he roared. "You only behave if it helps *you!*"
  

  
He threw me through the extra door into my backyard, one day ago. Before I could rush back inside, he slammed it shut. The door clicked with a loud finality as it locked.
  

  
The first door opened now. It never did that before. 
  

  
In that moment, I knew where the consequences of my actions had gone.
