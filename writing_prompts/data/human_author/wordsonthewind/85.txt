I like the way you portrayed Zoe. Her enthusiasm for life was vividly shown, and so was her somewhat concerning sugar habit. I wish there'd been room to explore that a bit more, but I don't mind it not being the focus. The kiss at the end was nice but I felt like it could have been phrased in a punchier way instead of being stuck to another clause with that "as". 

Good words!
