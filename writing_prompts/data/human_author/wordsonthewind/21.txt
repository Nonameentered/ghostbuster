Hi Dee! This was quite a chilling horror story. I appreciated the imagery in the details of the accident and the description of the monster at the end. It was really vivid and evocative, and captured the sense of his inevitable doom finally catching up to him well. 

As for crit, I feel like the "broken veil" bit could have been better tied into the earlier parts. Maybe that's what the episode in the city was for, and the context did make its meaning clear, but I feel like repeating the veil motif earlier on would have tied those parts together better. 

Good words!
