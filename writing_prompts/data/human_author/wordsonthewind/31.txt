Welcome to the capital of the Starlight Kingdom, honored guest. All the riches of the city are at your disposal.
  

  
Enjoy the shining buildings and pristine streets. The populace here is the most orderly in all of the Kingdom. Criminals and lawbreakers are a product of their environment. Therefore, wise Canopus, the guiding star of this city, has structured this environment to dissuade them as much as possible.
  

  
See the spotless surfaces, how they glow with a light that cannot be denied. Everything is under control. Humans are flawed and weak next to the stars and they must be watched closely to ensure that they do not falter. Canopus oversees the city he shines over each night and the people prosper under his loving surveillance. Everyone obeys the law here. They tread the path of the stars to salvation.
  

  
Service will begin soon. No, your attendance is not mandatory. Feel free to take a seat along the promenade and watch the procession. It won't last long enough to trigger the safety measures.
  

  
You needn't worry about them. These seats have simply been modified by order of the Council. Loitering in public is not permitted. The Archons provide the people with purpose and they must find rest in it, not in aimless indolence.
  

  
Meditation? Why, they may enter an appropriate temple to Canopus at any time of the day and contemplate the glory of the Archons there. Loitering is still not justified. Neither is taking undue advantage of the charity of the temples.
  

  
It... "stands in opposition to the original intent"? But how could it? The only intent that matters here is what the Archons want. What the Council wants.
  

  
Canopus is the shining jewel of the Starlight Kingdom and like any jewel, it must be polished and cut to be truly refined. The true treasures of any city are its people, and so its people must undergo the same refinement to make the city what it was meant to be.
  

  
You will be guided along the proper path.
  

  
Everyone smiles when the invisible eyes of the Archons are on them at all times. Disregard the burning pain in your skull. It is for your own good.
