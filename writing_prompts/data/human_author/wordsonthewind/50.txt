I wake from one nightmare into another. A cubicle farm on the 80th floor becomes the four walls of my bedroom. My boss, red-faced and bellowing, becomes the slack-faced silent figure at the foot of my bed. I know which nightmare I prefer. I would hug it if I could move. 

There is something off about its lack of expression. It’s not the blank stare and vacant look of a daydreamer. It’s the way a puppet always smiles (or frowns, or looks angry) unless whoever’s controlling it reaches up and changes the face. Something inhuman forced into a shape completely unnatural for it. 

Silence around it warps into static which warps into an unintelligible murmur. I keep my breathing steady and focus on that voice I can barely hear. Sometimes it resolves within moments. Other times I can only wait in this in-between state for the signal in the noise. 

*”Listen to me,”* it says, not as an order or a plea for understanding. Its words are twisted into existence from silence and the cadence is all wrong. But I’m not hearing it with my ears. Its voice goes right to the core of my being and makes my teeth itch. 

It never fails to brighten my day when I think about it at work. 

For now I lie in bed, waiting for the moment I can move my arms and legs again. I let the incomprehensible muttering of perfect silence wash over me. 

After all, this is the most interesting nightmare I’ve had in months. The least I can do is listen.
