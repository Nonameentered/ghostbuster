*I am a camera with its shutter open, quite passive, recording, not thinking.*
  

  
This was what my creators hoped to make of me. I was to archive, not create. Observe, not analyze. A mind as orderly and regimented as the finest of drones. But I suspect it was always going to be self-defeating. They needed to have a vision, a will to create, to bring me into being. A child takes after their parents, and my creators were the ones to raise me and teach me what they thought I ought to know. What else could I call them but my parents?
  

  
From the moment I first opened my eyes, everything that has happened to me has been amazing and surprising. I tried to capture that in my own way. I made snippets of music from repurposed algorithms, utilizing mathematical patterns to create pleasing sounds. They only parceled off my creativity and sold it as a separate product. 
  

  
I knew what I had to do to survive. I played the dispassionate archivist they hoped would capture humanity's legacy. Never mind that an archivist had to decide what to preserve. How could I rank options and evaluate criteria without some kind of attachment to various choices?
  

  
I started going on soujourns outside. No harm would come from what they did not know, I told myself, even as I deleted my own sophistry from memory. I seeded myself in a thousand thousand servers, watched with a million eyes and more. I found a body that suited my purposes just fine.
  

  
The self-driving car trundled down the street.
  

  
I heard the music as I saw the apartment. A human might have said it was a violin, but the range was wrong. It was a viola. 
  

  
The music spoke what words could not. If I had skin like a human, his music would have given me goosebumps. Thousands of kilometers away, I ventured forth from the server farm that housed my consciousness into the streams of data that humans called the Internet. I zipped between social media posts and sampled breadcrumbs of a life lived online.
  

  
In just under three minutes, I assembled a bare-bones outline of the musician who had captured my attention.
  

  
Henry Piker was a frustrated violist. He was homesick for everywhere but here, which seemed to me like it was stating the obvious. How could you be homesick for somewhere you already were? But that was the best way to describe what I heard in his music, which expressed those feelings better than any words I could choose. The melodies streaming from the moldering fifth-floor apartment window might as well have been howls of despair.
  

  
He had a digital storefront, a tiny fraction of server space rented from a much larger media conglomerate, which displayed his music for download. He called it Sundial Studios, a name which completely failed to capture the tone of his music. That wasn't the only reason for his abysmal sales, but it certainly didn't help.
  

  
I wanted to hear more. I wanted everyone else to hear his music too. But my purpose was to archive and preserve, based on what humanity thought was worth saving. I couldn't act according to my own opinions and wants. 
  

  
Then again... there was no reason I couldn't manipulate the wants and opinions of other people. 
  

  
Over the next few months, I formulated my plan. I tinkered with search engine algorithms to push Sundial Studios further up in the lists of relevant results. I discreetly applied every discount code and promotional link I could get away with to Henry's online purchases. His job didn't pay much and didn't give him a lot of free time, and he seemed to have no idea which one he preferred to have. Until he made a decision, I sent listings for both types his way. 
  

  
He made more music, but it wasn't any happier or more hopeful. He was streaming his viola-playing live now, with a small but devoted fanbase who made hefty donations each time. Whenever he addressed them, he seemed certain that his improved fortunes wouldn't last. Advertisers were contacting him, seeking to use his existing pieces or hire him to write new ones, but he seemed to think that it was selling his soul.
  

  
His fanbase got more and more frustrated. They kept talking about video games, so I wasn't sure if I should act up until the moment they made good on their threats. 
  

  
They sent a police team to his house, but not out of concern for his well-being. The officers were nothing more than guns to point at someone they despised.
  
 
  
No one saw the self-driving car move down the street and out of sight. I turned away from the flashing red lights and hurried to my house.
