In the years to come, historians would look back on this time as an age of excess. To Marie, those gilded years would always be the prime of her youth. 
  

  
Here in Industry, freed from toil, people were free to make the city whatever they wanted it to be. Robots woven into the structure of everything made the whims and fancies of the residents real. Any regrettable gaps in their knowledge bases were swiftly accounted for. To Marie, none of this was out of the ordinary. It was all normal for her, and she treated the three thousand dollars she received every month that paid for her apartment and all necessities as only what was owed to her. Leisure was the natural state of affairs. 
  

  
Marie had made her apartment into a wonderland of pastel and gold. She'd grown bored of minimalism long ago, so nothing here was purely functional. Chairs had delicate details carved into their frames. Cabinets were carved by hand by the best experts and talented amateurs her money could by. She could have printed them all, of course, with the designs she'd mocked up virtually, but human hands had a way of introducing little quirks. Marie had found no better way to give a piece character. 
  

  
"But, darling, where do you even shower?" Diamante asked as Marie led them into the living room. She'd lived here for nearly a year now, but a redesign as radical as this simply demanded a housewarming party. "Your ornamental philosophy was enchanting in design school, but... you still have to live here. Don't you?"
  

  
Marie smiled, gesturing at the soft pink walls and gold-accented portrait frames. "My dear, this is my life. When everything is ornamental, none of it is non-functional. It all serves a purpose. Being beautiful."
  

  
Diamante frowned, and Marie picked up on that immediately. What had gotten into her best friend? Diamante had been one of her biggest influences in her endeavors, always just a little bit ahead of the curve. Always spurring her onward to be a little bit more beautiful, to live for the aesthetic. 
  

  
"I wanted to talk to you about that, actually," Diamante said now.
  

  
Marie smiled. "You want to commission me?"
  

  
"Kind of," Diamante replied. "Well, you'd answer to my bosses, but you'd be working with me."
  

  
"Work?" Marie thought about it. "I haven't done that in a while. Could be fun. Tell me." 
  

  
Diamante relaxed in their chair. "They've got some of the other parts of the country wired up now. Not as much as Industry but it's a start. We were thinking we could build houses for some of those people there. Proper ones, not the disgusting hovels they live in now. The robots will make sure it's safe and up to standard, but you and me? We can make them beautiful."
  

  
Diamante knew her well. Marie was an acolyte of beauty, a priestess of the aesthetic. The sacred became secular here in her temple to beauty. It would be light and airy in her room. There would be no gloominess here, no dull or dingy colors. Everything would fit perfectly into her theme and there would be nothing but sunlight and gold at all times. 
  

  
But she worked better with quality material. And there was only so much she could do to make up for poor tools.
  

  
"I'm not sure it's my kind of project," Marie said instead.
  

  
"Really?" Diamante raised an eyebrow. "You don't want to spread your design philosophy all over the country? Have hundreds of people be surrounded by your ideals of beauty every day?"
  

  
"They wouldn't get it," Marie said. "They wouldn't see the design at all, let alone understand their part in it. They'd just mess it all up. Trample my vision."
  

  
Diamante stood up all at once, pushing their chair aside. "They live there."
  

  
Marie shrugged. "If that's what they want to call it. They have no imagination at all, it's a shame."
  

  
Diamante had nothing else to say to that, and Marie wouldn't have wanted to hear it either. But a party that dragged on too long was no party at all.

In hindsight, these twenty years would be seen as an aberration. It was a bright explosion before a return to darkness. Marie knew all about that. She would live in the brightness. The dazzling reveries and revels of the greatest city in the world. 
  

  
Here and now, her life was beautiful.
