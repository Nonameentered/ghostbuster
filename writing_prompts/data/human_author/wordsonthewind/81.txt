Oh, I liked the extended metaphor here. Very vivid and effective imagery too, especially with the fog and tangible darkness. It's all too clear what the black sea represents...

I might have preferred the sea, or at least some hint of the sea, to show up a bit earlier. A mention of a potential flood in the canyon might work if you want to keep to the ingredient order.

These are my thoughts. I hope this helps!
