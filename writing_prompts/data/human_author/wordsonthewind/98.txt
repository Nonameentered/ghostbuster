Reform so often meant upheaval. 
  

  
Lin Liu had learned this well during his time as a court official. The king held the divine mandate, but he remained in the capital and it was the king's nobles and generals who held the power here. And they all wanted to be the only one who had it. 
  

  
Marquis Zhao had foolishly given the province of Quwo to his uncle and now Prince Chengshi remained a thorn in their side three years later. Liu's fellow officials jockeyed for favor openly and schemed in the shadows when they thought they were alone. Liu had only ever wanted to serve his lord, but refusing to participate in those power plays meant he was sidelined more and more. His room was smallest and furthest away from the main building, little more than a brazier and bed surrounded by four wooden walls. 
  

  
He was still loyal, still trustworthy, and that only put him one step above outright disgrace. If he kept himself there, maybe he would only be dismissed from his post. There was no other way to escape alive.
  

  
So, when Liu woke to an immense pressure bearing down on his chest, the first thing he cursed was his bad luck and not his assailant. 
  

  
The demon was covered in filth. It looked like a man, but its eyes were cinnabar red and it was pinning him to the bed with one hand. Liu struggled, but the demon only pressed down harder and it felt like a boulder crushing the breath out of him. So he stopped.
  

  
"Immortality is a fool's wish," it hissed. "But all men are fools. Do you want to live?"
  

  
"Yes," Liu managed to wheeze even as he felt like his chest was about to cave in. "I want to live. Let me go!"
  

  
The pressure, impossibly, increased. It was a wonder that his ribs didn't break.
  

  
"What would you do to live?" The demon asked.
  

  
Liu knew the answer, knew that some things could not be borne, but in the face of slow suffocation all higher ideals fled from him. Deep inside, he knew the answer he would give.
  

  
Anything.
  

  
The demon eased up, but Liu was still pinned to the bed. He didn't dare to move.
  

  
"Other officials in other states spoke of serving their lord, working for the good of the state," the demon said. "They wouldn't live to see it, but their state would endure. What about you? Perhaps you want to be a state by yourself." 
  

  
Liu stared. "How would you do that?"
  

  
The demon laughed. "You wanted life. I could give you life unending and power which those carrion crows at court can never take away. If you kept yourself above them, you'd hold the power no matter who governs. You would be the state and its actions would be yours."
  

  
Liu hesitated. Then he said, "No."
  

  
"No?"
  

  
"Jin will endure," Liu said. "We have land. Our armies are strong. It doesn't need me to whisper in a marquis's ear or kill nobles." 
  

  
The demon looked disappointed. "You are not strong enough or brutal enough to ensure Jin's survival. Your state will fall, and I will find one of stronger will who will accept this immortality."
  

  
Before Liu could react, it took his head in its hands and twisted.
  

  
The death of a minor court official in the night barely warranted a note in the records. Reform so often meant upheaval.
