Hi Wiley! I appreciated this small moment in a fight for survival. The narrator's desperation came through well in this piece, especially in how they treasured their fire and pot. Their description of being too hungry to care about taste and eating even the eyeballs of the fish was good too. 

>	Slippery and cold to the touch I pinned it against a clean smooth rock with my left hand and deftly began to clean my meal, the edge of my knife audibly scraping against bone, as I cut long strips of pink meat from the carcass, discarding the digestive track, stomach and intestines.

I think this sentence could have been broken up somewhat. There's quite a bit going on here, and it would be easier to read that way. 

Good words!
