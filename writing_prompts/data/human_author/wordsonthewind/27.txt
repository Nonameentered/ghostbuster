It was a wrong number that started it, the telephone ringing three times in the dead of night, and the voice on the other end asking for someone he was not.

"Dennis," the voice on the other end said. "Is Dennis there? Could you get him?"

He wasn't Dennis. He had no idea where Dennis was now. Whoever was on the other end didn't care.

"Why did you move here? Come home. There's a room with your name on it."

"I'm not-"

"Just until you get back on your feet again. I believe in you, you know. I've always believed in you."

The words died in his throat.

He didn't think about his old life. He'd had a comfortable office job with a promotion lined up, a girl he was going to marry. They were working on the white picket fence and 2.5 children. All in due time.

But that was Before. Before the eggheads and tech whizzes made all those breakthroughs which utterly reshaped everyone's lives. At first it was once every few years, then once every other year. Either time had sped up or his mind had slowed down, because now it felt like his world was completely upended every few months.

He'd fallen apart after that. Everything could change at any moment, suddenly and forever. The life path lost its appeal. It wasn't a fragrant world he'd been born into, and there was no point in trying to come out of it smelling like roses.

Others lived their cyberpunk dreams. He had a dilapidated room barely wide enough to swing a cat, with only a typewriter and some essentials. He couldn't afford what was considered a computer these days, but he could do his job fine with his phone and a hologram keyboard. It was technically against office regulations, but he only took this job to fill his waking hours. The real money-maker was renting out your dreams. Eight hours of soda commercials paid for an entire month's rent and groceries. The set-up hung on the wall next to his sleeping bag because he couldn't afford an actual bed.

The typewriter was useless. That was why he'd bought it. Sometimes he would type on it and pretend he was a starving writer working towards his big break, but he always ended up in tears.

The voice kept calling him. He started typing up their conversations afterwards. Sometimes he said nothing, but the voice bloviated enough for two. He felt for Dennis then, whoever he was and wherever he was now.

"When was the last time you slept?" the voice asked him one night.

He blinked, confused. "I was sleeping when you called me."

"You weren't sleeping," the voice said. "I heard your mind whirring away. You'll ruin your sleep schedule if you keep playing video games like that."

"How did you hear me while the phone was ringing?"

"I saw the most charming bird the other day," the voice said instead. "Probably from one of those Colombian drug cartels, but it looked just like the real thing. Do you remember when I tried to get you into birdwatching and you asked, 'What's a bird?'"

His laugh was genuine, startling himself. Later he wrote up his version of how the conversation with the real Dennis might have gone. He only teared up a little.

One night he answered the phone and heard nothing but a slow rattling exhale.

He could guess where his mysterious caller lived. There'd dropped enough context clues about their location before. But when he opened the emergency services app on his phone, his best guess wasn't there. Other triangulation techniques and pings returned nothing. It was like the house wasn't even wired to the grid.

In the end, he called the police.

&#x200B;

Their technician came over only after everything was settled. She got to work immediately, opening panels, untangling wires. It was like the guts of his apartment had been pulled out.

"Ghosts in the phone lines," he muttered. "Now I've seen everything."

The technician frowned from under the mass of wires. "I hate that word. Smart tech interacts weirdly with personality imprints sometimes. It doesn't mean people go on living after they die."

"But he talked." He considered how that sounded, then said more firmly. "We talked."

She snorted. "Did you really? Or did you sit there while it went on its generated spiel? But I know some people who would consider that a conversation."

"So that's it, then," he said slowly. "You're getting rid of it."

"Not quite." The technician straightened up and wiped her hands on her overalls. "Obsolete hardware's a real pain in the ass, and so are the imprints encoded inside. No way has yet been invented to say goodbye to them."
