The summoning circle was a crude thing, drawn in chalk with a shaky hand on a concrete floor. The offering was a bird, already half-dead from a car before its lifeblood had been spilled with a rusty knife. But the desire behind this summoning burned fiercer than anything the demon had felt in a long time. It was a pull that tore the demon's substance from its place in hell, eternally entwined with its fellows, and sent it flying through the ether to its destination. 

It manifested in the circle. For a moment it simply basked in the sheer joy of having form again. Function would come later, defined by the summoner. For now, it would shape its form to show that it could serve.

It opened its newfound eyes. A child stood outside the circle. A boy, not more than nine years old, holding a rusty dripping knife. 

"It worked...?" His eyes widened. "It worked!" 

A smile crept across his face. "They're all gonna be sorry..."

The demon quickly realized that what it had assumed to be wonder and triumph was actually malicious glee. Revenge, at least, was familiar ground.

"This one is at your service, mighty summoner." Flattery was always a safe move. "Only name the torments you wish to inflict upon your enemies and it shall be done."

"What?" The boy frowned, then shook his head. "You look weird and you talk funny. I'm not torturing anyone. I just want you to be my friend."

With that, the demon felt itself shift. It had been given a function and now *it* was becoming *he,* as his form changed to match. Moments later a little boy stood in the circle: small and dark-haired, quick and tough. Memories would need to be adjusted in the local area, but for now an imaginary friend suited both of their purposes just fine.

"Simon," the boy said. "You're Simon now. I'm Robert."

Simon stepped out of the circle. He had form, function and a name. Now he was free of hell and that wretched intermingling with the other demons as long as the summoning lasted.

"Hi, Robert!" A catcher's mitt appeared on his hand, followed by a signed baseball. "Wanna play catch in that lovely yard?"

Henry had brought that ball to class for show-and-tell the week before. Robert was still stewing over being upstaged. With a neighbor who didn't care enough for children to tell one little boy apart from another, a good strong throw with a hidden hand could do a lot. 

Robert's eyes lit up. "Let's go."
