Hi Tomorrow! What a lovely pome. I appreciated this different perspective of light from someone with a migraine. Great work!

I would have liked more sensory descriptions of the light during a migraine. The last part read pretty well to me with a good cadence too, but the sudden perspective shift from "you" to "me" was a little jarring. I feel like it would be better to stick to one POV for this poem. 

Good words!
