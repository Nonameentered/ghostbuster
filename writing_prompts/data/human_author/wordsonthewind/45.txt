Hi Farma! I liked this road trip story. The dated slang might have been over the top for something set within that period but as a scene in an in-universe movie it worked really well. Tom's unrequited love for his costar came across well too.

The rest of the passage was in past tense so this switch to present kind of stood out to me. Unless it was meant to be his thoughts? The italics didn't carry over in that case. 

Good words!
