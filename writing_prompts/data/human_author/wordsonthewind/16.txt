Oh, this was wonderful. Such a simple situation, but you brought out the emotions in it well. I really felt for the unfairness of Cindy's situation. The ending was a great twist too. I liked the symmetry of her mother's self-imposed punishment. 

I kind of feel like Cindy should've had more of a reaction to being vindicated especially with the focus on her suffering earlier. She had to write all those lines that cramped her hand for nothing, after all. I'm not sure good grades and dinner out would make it all okay just like that.

This bit was kind of choppy and took away from the impact of the ending IMO. I feel like it could have been shortened to "It was a long sheet of looseleaf paper, covered in the unmistakable penmanship of her mother." Just my two cents. 

These are my thoughts. I hope this helps!
