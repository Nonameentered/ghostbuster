I have never drawn that sigil. Sorry. 

I liked the explanation of how magic works but I also feel like the story only starts when Solomon introduces himself. Maybe he could introduce himself and explain his magic later? People are drawing his sigils but the stars are powering it all. That makes sense to me. 

>	Now to make the symbol endless, draw two final lines: draw a line inward from the bottom of the body above, to the center of the line linking the body below with the mind above, and then draw a line inward from the top of the soul below, to the center of the line linking the soul above with the mind below.

This whole thing is one sentence. I think it'd look better broken up a bit. 

Good words! The punchline really got me.
