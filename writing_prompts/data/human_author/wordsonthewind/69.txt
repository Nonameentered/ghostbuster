Revolution! I still have some questions about how we got here, but with only 500 words I understand focusing on the end result instead. Not sure when the tradespeople and common folk got there though. I feel like a brief mention of them storming the palace/being let in by the guards Charlotte subverted would help with that. 

Charlotte has good intentions for sure, but she does seem like a ruthless ambitious sort. I'd have liked to see more of the plan she alluded to at the end. Good words!
