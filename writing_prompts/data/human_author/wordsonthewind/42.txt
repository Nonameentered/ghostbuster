Hi Android! If your goal was to earn as many points as possible with the past theme words, you've definitely succeeded. I like the narrative you crafted with them and the hints of the surrounding world. The prose was a little on the flowery side, but I did to guess the spoiler content without clicking on it so it's not completely obscure. It suits the narrator well too. 

>	The pressure got to your organs. The radiation passed right through you. Those two will wreak havoc on a body, turning it to a corpse.

This part felt kind of bare next to the rest of the story. As a simple description of (I'm assuming) what a nuclear bomb does to someone it works fine, but I'd have appreciated a more evocative description of the effects of pressure and radiation on the unfortunate soul caught in the blast. Just something to match with the tone of the rest of the piece. 

Good words!
