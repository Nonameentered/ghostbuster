Tonight was the night. Nicolas had been preparing for it ever since he learned it was possible. He'd meditated for days at a time on the undeathly energies that animated him. He fed only on auspicious days and on carefully-chosen victims to increase the power of his blood. He'd tracked down the location and monitored it closely in the preceding weeks. On this night, when the veil between realms was thinnest, Bartholomew would return to him once more.
  

  
The creation of thralls was an old technique. Nicolas's sire had scorned it. He said that thralls were mindless, fit for only the simplest tasks. But Nicolas had seen these supposedly mindless automatons fight skillfully in battle. Other vampires had supposedly raised departed family members and lovers for eternal companionship. Perhaps his sire simply preferred to torment the living.
  

  
The cemetery saw less use after cremation got popular. Bartholomew's tiny grave was long since overgrown with wildflowers but Nicolas didn't mind. He would have something far better soon.
  

  
He raised his shovel and began digging. As he dug he reached out to sense the death within the ground until he found what he was looking for. Then he gave one simple order:
  

  
*Rise.*
  

  
The dirt moved and Nicolas dug to meet it halfway. He couldn't let Bartholomew do all the work. 
  

  
*No more nine lives for you. You can have all the life you want. I'll keep you with me forever!*
  

  
Finally the body broke the surface and his childhood pet was in his arms, black fur tangled with grave dirt but already beginning to stir. It was like he was simply taking a nap on a lazy summer afternoon. Nicolas couldn't help but laugh.
  

  
He raised Bartholomew's throat to his lips. One bite and the first friend he ever had would live forever.
  

  
Bartholomew shifted, as if asleep, away from fangs he couldn't possibly have seen.
  

  
Nicolas tried again, frowning. Bartholomew twisted away again. 
  

  
The third time, Bartholomew opened milky-white eyes and hissed, twisting in his grip. Feebly, with the process incomplete, but in that moment of surprise he raked his claws down Nicolas's face.
  

  
That hiss stung worse than any scratch.
  

  
Nicolas held him gingerly at arm's length. Cats always did exactly as they pleased. Maybe Bartholomew just didn't want to be a thrall.
  

  
But Nicolas had seen Bartholomew being stubborn. This was different. 
  

  
*Who are you?* the hiss seemed to say. What have you done with *My Boy?* 
  

  
Nicolas did the only thing he could. Blinking back tears, he placed Bartholomew back in the ground.
  

  
Bartholomew blinked back slowly even as his fur crumbled to dust. When he closed his eyes again, they remained shut. Within moments the body sank below the ground and the earth closed over the dug-up grave.
  

  
Nicolas looked at the pile of dirt that marked Bartholomew's resting place now. Tomorrow, he decided, he would plant some proper flowers.
