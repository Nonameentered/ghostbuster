I never met my landlord. Maybe that should have been my first clue, but when you first start renting it’s hard to tell an absentee landlord apart from one who’s been devoured by eldritch horrors. It took me a while to learn the difference. 

I didn’t need a basement, so it didn’t really bother me that my new house only sometimes had one. Dollar-store earplugs took care of the noise. The attics that occasionally showed up gave me a much harder time. I kept thinking I’d misplaced something in there, something I’d forgotten to unpack in the move, and I had to retrieve  it. Marie Kondo helped a lot with that though. Now I simply remind myself that I already have everything which sparks joy in the two normal floors of my house. 

Well, normal for the house. My bedroom likes to play hide-and-seek. Sometimes the house tries to disguise a different room as my bedroom, but after I shut the door on a mirror-reversed copy of my room and heard a shriek of frustration from the basement, I got good at spot-the-difference fast. 

After that I decided to document all the ways the house shifted. All the tricks and traps it employed. 

This is the theory I wrote in my notes: My house isn’t haunted. Ghosts used to be human, or have some connection to humanity. The thing playing with my house was never human, and that meant it could never match what the dumbest ghost was capable of. 

I said as much to the house when it spoke to me through the basement. I stopped getting rent notices after that. I stopped paying rent, but I was never evicted. One less expense every month was nothing to sneeze at. 

I left my notes incomplete for a reason. The house’s mind games left me cold, but it could still affect me. The more of its strange internal logic I pieced together, the more I changed. I didn’t need as much sleep. I only ate when I remembered to.

This is my theory: the house is a labyrinth, and it needs its Minotaur.
