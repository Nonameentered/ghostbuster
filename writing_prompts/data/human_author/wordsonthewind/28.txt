Oh, I liked the description in this piece. The trickling shivers of cold was an especially vivid image. 

I feel like the narration's keeping it at a distance though: 

>	An overwhelming sense of despair had arisen.

>	Every step I took increased that ever-growing sense of hopelessness and caused further decline of any strength I had left.

These parts are kind of formal and sound detached from the emotion they're describing. It ended up blunting all the imagery somewhat, at least for me. I'd have appreciated more ways of conveying that despair through the narration instead of simply stating that it's there. 

These are my thoughts. I hope this helps!
