Hello Box Man! Hitchhiker's Guide is amazing. When it comes to dry humor and amusing tangents Adams and Pratchett are in a class of their own, but this was a good showing from you. I particularly liked the little hints of the author's personality and background you included in the recipe. 

This bit felt awkward though: 

>(he was referring to himself, yet he was laughed at and eaten before any of the editors realized that).
  

  
He was laughed \[at\] and eaten, as it was customary for the Encyclopaedia Galactica editors to do with their more foolish members.

The three-beat with "laughed at and eaten" was a good idea but this feels a bit too repetitive for me. I think it's partly because these two sentences have a very similar structure. They also drop the same piece of trivia that the Encyclopaedia Galactica editors laugh at and eat their more idiotic contributors? Just my impression, anyway.

These are my thoughts. I hope this helps!
