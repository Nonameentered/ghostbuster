Jellyfish were ubiquitous these days. For creatures which were supposedly biologically immortal, they died surprisingly easily. Then they washed up on shore to vex barefoot beach-goers who just wanted to frolic in the sand without feeling the sting of floppy tentacles. But this tropical menace just wouldn't be vanquished. They would be the last things alive in the oceans, Rao was sure. Aside from the algae blooms anyway.
  

  
Rao had once dreamed of being a marine biologist. But it was looking more and more like those two organisms would be the only things left to study by the time he got his PhD. Still, he'd graduated from high school along with everyone else here. They'd all floundered at first, flabbergasted at no longer being the best and brightest. But they'd tackled their challenges together and now they were moving on to better things. The oil companies couldn't take that away.
  

  
The gathering had been his idea. He brought the potato salad and avocado toast. Nobody liked Freddy's limeade but Freddy didn't mind. It meant there was more from him. He was off to the side now, taking a break from devouring watermelon slices to guzzle down his favorite drink and quench his thirst. Rao could believe that this was his idea of a perfect day. 
  

  
Mel, ever the optimist, had brought a frisbee. Now she was trying to organize a game, recruiting classmates for teams. 
  

  
Flora lounged in the shade of her parasol. She hadn't brought a swimsuit, merely slathered on copious amounts of sunscreen even though it was impossible to get sunburned in that dress, and settled down on her picnic mat to read. Sometimes she closed her eyes like she was listening to the waves. Rao remembered the stories Mel had spread in their first year, that Flora was a vampire or Amish. She wasn't, of course. Only what Rao's father would have called eccentric, fastidious about her clothes.
  

  
"Where's your sense of spontaneity?" Mel was asking her now.  
  

  
"I wore a sun-dress," Flora replied. "What more do you want?"
  

  
"Oh, come on," Mel shot back. "Who goes to a beach and doesn't swim?"
  

  
"You."
  

  
Rao decided to make himself scarce and try the ice cream instead. It was a smart move, he decided, because the class valedictorian had the same plan.
  

  
"Rebecca," he said. "Heard you got into MIT's astrophysics program. Congratulations!"
  

  
"I'm exploring my options," Rebecca said. "I had more choices than I expected. Might go off in a radical new direction, I dunno."
  

  
"What else would you want to do?" Rao asked. "You always talked about sailing across the universe through your telescope."
  

  
Rebecca shrugged. "We'll never make it off this planet. Sometimes I don't know if I'm seeing meteors or space debris when I stargaze. Maybe I should keep my sights earthbound after all."
  

  
Rao might have pointed out the haze of toxic smoke that was omnipresent in the air now, but he didn't want to vindicate her defeatism.
