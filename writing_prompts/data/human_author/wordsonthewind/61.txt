"Cheryl, don't stand in front of that thing." 

Cheryl's gaze lingered on the giant mechanical arm mounted to the countertop. "But I wanna watch it make drinks." 

She'd never been to Industry before, let alone one of their robotic cafes. She'd heard the stories about the capital city though. Industry was badly named, they said, because no one there worked for a living. Robots did everything difficult, boring or dangerous. Any job worth doing was at least one of those three, so the humans of Industry were left idle. They collected stipends just for existing and wasted their days in cafes like this one. People like Cheryl and her parents only came here as a reward. 

No one else was by the drinks robot. Her parents were trying to order with the provided tablets. Everyone else was preoccupied with their food. 

"Hello!" She said to it. "How are you today?" 

The iron limb whirred as it lumbered to life. Its fingers waggled before setting to work once more. Filling cups from the bottles attached to the ceiling or placing them under automatic dispensers. It even poured a cup of tea. 

"Mummy, did you see that? The robot waved at me!" 

"Just its calibration sequence, sweetheart," her mom said. "Come on. I finally managed to send our orders." 

Cheryl hurried over and plopped into the empty seat next to her dad. "Why doesn't the robot have palms?" 

"It doesn't need palms," her dad said. "See? It grabs things with those pincers." 

"But how does it do that without palms?" 

Her parents didn't know. After a while they started talking about the automated kitchen, so she went back to the arm again. 

Her dad was right. It didn't need palms for what it did. 

"But they're nice to have anyway," she said quietly. "I can do lots of different things with them..." 

She rubbed her hands to demonstrate, then clapped them together. "I hope you'll get to do them too, one day." 

"Oh, our food's here!" her mom said. 

A robot with several trays set into it and an LED display of a smiley face had rolled up to their table. The topmost tray had their orders, taking up three glasses and four plates in total.

Four? That wasn't right. 

Her mom frowned. "We didn't order the chocolate cake." 

"It's a special promotion for tourists,"  the tray-holding robot said. "Free dessert for children under 12." 

Her dad frowned. "The briefing didn't mention this." 

"Limited time only." 

"Don't question it, darling," her mom said. "Free dessert is free dessert." 

The robot's LED display showed a grin. "Enjoy your meal!" 

For a moment, as it faced Cheryl, its grin became a wink. That moment passed and it trundled on to the next table. 

Cheryl glanced at the robotic arm. 

"Eat up," her dad said. "The bus arrives in an hour and we can't miss our ride to the theme park." 

Cheryl nodded and started on her lunch.
