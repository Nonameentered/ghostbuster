Mrs Lee dropped off a sample of her latest baking experiment this evening. She couldn't just hand it to me with the new rules in place, but she had a lot of Tupperware containers and no shame at talking through closed doors. 

"Let me know what you think!" She practically bellowed. "The twins helped me today. The recipe promised soft and fluffy rolls, but... well, you'll see!"

The shape told me what had happened. A quick taste test only confirmed it. 

I sent her a message on NextDoor. 

*Your dough didn't rise enough. Could be a lot of different reasons. Don't worry, I like hard rolls.*

I sent a few links for further reading and left the empty Tupperware container on my doorstep. she swung by minutes later. 

"Thanks for the links! We'll try again tomorrow," she said. 

This was her cue to leave. But today she decided to go off script. 

"Are you coming to the Zoom block party later?"

I hurried back to the door. "I don't know..."

"It'll be fun! Everyone's going nuts. I think we've been cooped up inside for too long. When was the last time you went to a party?"

I waved her off with a promise to attend. Even if I'd never been to a party at all. 

People-watching was the only hobby I could afford. I'd look for the little moments and characters that stood out, marvelling at how my life intersected with theirs for the briefest instants.  
When the crowds became too much for me, I found a new job and rearranged my routine, but I kept my hobby. The apartment walls are thin. I observed a thousand tiny dramas from the comfort of my living room couch. 

Then the pandemic struck. I worked remotely and had my groceries delivered, so I thought my life wouldn't change with the lockdowns. But I forgot something important. 

I'd been stuck inside. Now the world was stuck inside with me. 

When I logged in later that night, I was mostly amazed that they found a way to party again. Almost as amazed at how they shoehorned in alcohol and party games while everyone sat at their computers.

"We should do this properly when the pandemic is over," Mrs Lee said. Her face was lobster-red from just one glass. "This is the first time I've talked to some of you. This is the first time I've *seen* some of you! Who knew you could get to know people while being inside all day?"

I didn't answer right away. I was busy putting names and faces to the characters I'd followed for so long. There was something strange about it, even with faces as ordinary as theirs. 

It was enough to let me believe I would see them again when we were no longer trapped in our homes.
