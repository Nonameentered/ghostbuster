A brief and effective glimpse into a very different world. I really appreciated the display of good sportsmanship on Karthan's part and his thoughts on the game he was really playing. Excellent work!

I would have liked some more anatomical details to get a better picture of what Karthan and Eppek were. I thought they were gorillas at first but they also have tails so it feels like they're monkeys? They could have been included in the fight scene no problem. There were also a number of unnecessary commas throughout the story

>	He knew he was the best, in all the Hanging City.

>	when he awoke in the morning, and emerged from his hut at the base of a thick branch

>	He accepted his friendâ€™s challenge, and charged across the bridge

These are my thoughts. I hope this helps!
