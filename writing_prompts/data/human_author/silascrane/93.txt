The young guardsman burst into the king's study, breathing heavily.

"Sire!" the soldier gasped, leaning forward and placing his hands on his knees as he struggled to catch his breath. "Sire, grave news! The princess has been kidnapped!" 

"Oh, has she...?" the monarch muttered, distractedly, as he continued perusing the documents laid out on his desk through the pince-nez spectacles perched on his nose. To the guard's surprise, he simply trailed off, as he traced a line of text with a fingertip, and then paused to dip his ornate ostrich-feather quill in ink, and scratch out a note in the margin of the page.

"Sire..." the guardsman said, hesitantly, as he recovered his composure and straightened to attention. "Should you not be...more concerned?"

The king looked up, peering at the guardsman over the top of his glasses. His face broke into a grin, and he chuckled. "Ah! You must be new here."

The guardsman blinked. "Well...yes, your majesty. I just started, and...well, I was actually assigned to patrol the upper corridors, but when I passed by a window I saw the princess' chamber across the courtyard and--"

"Don't worry." the king interrupted, waving his quill dismissively. "She's more than capable of handling herself."

Before the guardsman could reply or even process this statement, the side door into the king's study burst open, and a young woman stalked in. She wore a light blue dress of suitably regal styling that matched her flashing blue eyes, although atop this she wore a soot-stained leather apron adorned with a multitude of pouches and pockets. Despite this unusual attire, and the smoked-glass goggles resting on her forehead, she was unmistakably *the crown princess.*

"Your highness?" the guard exclaimed, incredulously.

"Papa!" the princess cried, ignoring the guard and turning to the king, crossing her arms. "Have I been kidnapped again?"

The king smiled at his daughter, fondly. "There you are, my little cornflower! Yes, sweetling, this young gentleman was just informing me that you've been abducted."

She threw up her hands, making a disgusted sound. Then she whirled on the guard, startling him by stepping close, and jabbing a finger at his chest.  "How many times do I have to tell you people? Whenever I'm kidnapped, report it to *me* first! How difficult is that to understand?"

The guard gaped mutely, looking from the king to the princess in utter confusion.

"Now now," the king admonished her gently, waving his quill at her. "That's not how we talk to our subjects, cornflower. This young fellow was evidently the first one to notice you were missing, and he's *new.* He couldn't have known."

The princess scoffed, but then abruptly straightened, her voice becoming measured and regal. She folded her hands in front of herself, placidly, and adopted a neutral expression as she turned back to the guard.  "We apologize for our outburst, guardsman. We do not fault you for this incident, and appreciate your faithful service."

The guardsman simply bowed to her, uncertain of what else to do.

The king beamed at his offspring. "That's my girl! Now that decorum is restored, do you still have time to recall your little pet?"

The princess sighed. "No, it had already been too long, when I came in. I really would have liked to have those kidnappers retrieved and questioned, for once -- these constant abductions are becoming a nuisance." She shrugged, and continued.  "Alas, absent any other instructions, my decoy homunculus will have resorted to its default command set by now, and exploded once it was a safe distance from the palace."

"Aw, I'm sorry, poppet." the king cooed, frowning sympathetically. 

She sighed again, but then smiled. "Oh well. Back to the lab to make a replacement, I suppose. Can't let their numbers get too low -- if I don't have enough decoys, they might eventually grab the *real* me."

"Good girl. 'Try, try again', and all that." the king encouraged, cheerfully. The monarch glanced at the guardsman, and then motioned to the doors with his quill. "That will be all, young man, thank you."

Just as the guardsman was about to leave, the doors to the study burst open again. A young page boy stumbled in. His face was deathly pale, and tears stained his cheeks.

"Y-your majesty." the lad stuttered, his watery eyes wide. "Th-the prince is *dead!"* 

The guardsman gasped, but then cocked his head in consternation, as the princess simply rolled her eyes and walked right past the distraught page into the corridor beyond, muttering something about her brother, and his 'weird hobbies'.

The king raised his eyebrows, regarding his horrified young servant thoughtfully. "Hm. It seems we're taking on a *lot* of new staff, lately."
