The Genie was a fixer who could make things happen that no one else could. So went the story that was told in the darkest corners of the City of Sin. In Las Vegas, desperate people turned to this mysterious man for miracles, and more often than not, miracles were what he delivered.  Debts could disappear. *People* could disappear. For a price. 

"I can give you what you need." The Genie said, before his prospective client could even speak. He smiled at the man seated across from him in his private, curtained-off booth in the back of the restaurant at the famous Bellagio Hotel, but the expression didn't touch his steel-gray eyes.

The man's expression brightened, but then he hesitated, licking his lips nervously. Sometimes, the story went, The Genie's price was high. You might have to do things that would haunt you, to settle your account with the enigmatic problem-solver. But then again, people also claimed he'd sometimes *grant your wish* for inscrutable reasons of his own, at seemingly no cost at all. 

Since he operated in Las Vegas, it was little wonder thay most of The Genie's prospective clients were inclined to gamble on his fickle largesse.

 "Sir, I have to be honest, I-I need a *lot* of money..." the man began.

The Genie's smile faded, and he shook his head, interrupting. "No, you don't." Before the man could protest, he continued. "What you *really* need, is for a man named James Delvecchio *not* to put your dismembered body in a hole out in the desert. Am I right?"

The man's face paled, but he nodded, vigorously. The Genie's smile returned. "I'm glad we're on the same page. Now, there are certain...formalities, to be taken care of." The Genie reached into the center of the table, and drew back a velvet cover that had been draped over an object between himself and his client.

The man chuckled when we saw it, but when he saw the Genie wasn't laughing, he pretended to be clearing his throat, instead. The object was an old brass oil lamp, with arabesque ornamentation. It looked like a stereotypical magic lamp.

"So, like, you...you want me to wish for my debt to be taken care of?" the man asked, hesitantly.

The Genie shook his head. "No. I already know what *you* need." The Genie withdrew a small card from inside his coat, and held it out to his client. The man reached for it, but the Genie pulled it back.

"Listen carefully. When I hand you this card, you will place your hand on the object on the table, and you will read the text on the card, exactly as written. If you fail to read the text correctly, or if you do anything other than what I have instructed, then our arrangement will be null and void, and I will never again offer you my services. I will not answer any questions about what is written on the card, and you will not ask any, or again, this meeting will be over. Do you understand?" The Genie said. His expression was flat, and there was no trace of humor in his voice.

"Y-yes." the man stammered, nervously, glancing from the Genie to his lamp. The Genie offered the card again, and the man took it in shaky fingers and placed his other hand on the old lamp. He read over the text a few times, to ensure he wouldn't make a mistake, and then slowly and deliberately read it aloud, being careful to enunciate. He looked at the Genie expectantly. The man's smile returned.

The Genie reached into his coat again and produced a smartphone. He tapped the screen, and then placed it on the desk where his client could see.

*Calling James Delvecchio...*

When the call connected, the man flinched as he heard a voice that had recently threatened to brutally torture and murder him say "Hello?"

"Hello, James. A man named Ryan R. Spencer owes you a considerable sum of money."

There was a pause on the other end of the line.

"Yeah, that's right." Delvecchio said.

"As of now, Mr. Spencer's account with you is closed, and his debt cleared. Henceforth, you and your associates will refrain from harming or otherwise contacting him. In exchange, I will consider *one* of the favors that you owe me discharged. Agreed?"

There was another pause.

"Agreed." Delvecchio said.

The Genie disconnected the call with a casual tap, and replaced the phone in his jacket pocket.

*"Granted,"* he said, with a wry smirk.

"So," Spencer said, swallowing hard. "What do *I* owe you, then? Uh, a favor, or...?"

The Genie raised an eyebrow. "Owe me? You owe me nothing, Mr. Spencer. Our business is concluded."

The man opened his mouth, like he was about to ask a question, but then he seemingly recalled The Genie's earlier injunction against doing so.

"T-thank you." he stammered, instead.

The Genie simply made a motion with his head, indicating that Spencer was free to leave. Looking relieved, the man hastily made his exit from the booth.

The Genie sighed, picking up the card where Spencer had dropped it on the table. He turned it over, and looked at the clearly printed boldface text he'd had the man read aloud.

*I wish that John S.W. Parker of Las Vegas, Nevada had one year added to the span of his life.*

John glanced upward at the genie -- the *real* genie -- that swirled in the air above his private table, glowering down at him. He'd long since wished to be the only person who could see or hear the spirit, of course.

Genies, as he'd learned when he found the lamp, aren't like in the stories. The Wishes they grant *did* exact a terrible price, that much was true. But the actual number of Wishes wasn't limited to three, and the price, rather than some tricky twisting of the words of the Wish, was actually quite straightforward. The genies always informed their masters of the cost, upfront: every Wish granted took time off the wisher's life, in proportion to the size of the Wish.

His first Wish, healing a minor injury to his foot, had only cost him a day of life, though the genie seemed to pity him, as it granted it. The spirit acted like it was sure he'd just started down a path of self-destruction that would lead to him wishing his whole life away in a matter of months. That had been back when the genie still liked him, of course. When it still *underestimated* him.

He'd known he couldn't keep solving all his problems with wishes, from the beginning. And he'd learned he couldn't just wish for more life to make wishes with. There was a great deal of entropy involved in converting life into magic, and he'd always lose more life than he gained -- as the genie had helpfully explained. But, it had occurred to John that these problems could be circumvented, if *someone else* made a wish to add to John's lifespan.

Spencer had still gotten a pretty good deal, by John's reckoning, even if the man didn't realize what his deliverance had cost him. Delvecchio would have killed the hapless gambler inside a week, and would have taken his time doing it. Now, unless he managed to piss off another sadistic loan shark in the coming decades, Ryan Spencer could die peacefully of natural causes -- and only five or six years sooner than he would have otherwise.
