I think JW people use it in as a literal specific number of  people, but in the Biblical Book of Revelations, it's a (debatably) metaphorical number of people who stand alongside the returned Christ during the end of days. 

The reference to that number here is merely an easter egg, this being a sort of a apocalyptic story.
