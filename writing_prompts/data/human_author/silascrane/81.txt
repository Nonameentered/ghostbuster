I stepped out onto my front porch, and greeted the sunrise with a yawn, and a wide stretch of my arms. The hands of my *other* arms rested on my hips. It felt like I'd always had the extra limbs, even though I'd just woken up with them today.

*"I wish everyone would wake up tomorrow having four arms! No explanation, just four arms -- a-and if they only had one arm or no arms, they now have four...um, oh, yeah, and everyone knows how to use them!"*

That was what I'd said to the genie, yesterday. As you might guess, I made that wish in haste. That's because my *first* wish was to be clairvoyant, able to see coming disasters before they happened. Well, I saw what was going to happen today in *horrifying* detail.

Billions of interdimensional creatures, like insects the size of cats, would start appearing from the ether, I foresaw. They resembled wingless parasitic wasps, who'd leap up and latch on to people's faces. Most people wouldn't be strong enough to pull them loose in a timely fashion, but their face-hugging, while terrifying, was relatively harmless. The adult creatures had no mouths or mandibles -- it wasn't like they could eat your face off, or anything.

The real danger was their long whip-like tail with a needle-like stinger on the end, that was actually an ovipositor. While people were distracted trying to pull the creatures loose, they'd be covertly injected with their eggs. The creatures would die and fall off a few minutes later, but the day after, their human victims would also die, *horribly,* as dozens of newly hatched larva ate their way out of their guts. 

The little bug larva would kill everyone on Earth this way, before pupating and disappearing into another dimension to start the cycle over.

I shuddered at the memory of my vision of the events that would occur today, as I stood on my porch. It was a terrifying scenario.

Well, it was a terrifying scenario for people who had only *two* arms.

As I stood on my porch, one of the prophesized creatures materialized before me, then leaped up and latched onto my face. As I had been granted the native reflexes of a four-armed creature, I instinctively seized it with all four of my hands. Three yanked it off my face, while the fourth restrained its lashing tail. I threw it on the ground, and stomped it flat.

As I looked around, I saw my equally four-armed neighbors having similar encounters with the hapless invaders, who were getting pulled free and squished by their would-be hosts. I smiled. The human race was going to be okay.

I felt a small hand tug at the leg of my pants. It wasn't one of mine. I also don't have kids.

I glanced down. My golden retriever, Rex, was tugging on my pantleg with one hand. Another held his leash, and  the other two were making excited beckoning motions. I could tell he wanted to go for a walk, and maybe chase some of those weird bug things falling from the sky. 

Ah. In my wish, I had said *everyone.* Not every *human.* I shrugged. Well, as genie-wish side effects went, I decided this was fine, all things considered. I clipped on the leash, and my dog gave me an exuberant fist bump, which we both 'blew up' thereafter, because me and Rex are party bros like that.

I felt pretty good, as I walked Rex down the street. I had the ability see future disasters, and one more Wish left to thwart the next one -- should it be needed, that is. It seemed to me that whatever challenge faced humanity next, we'd basically be *twice* as capable of dealing with it, even if I never used my final wish.

After all, forewarned is four-armed.
