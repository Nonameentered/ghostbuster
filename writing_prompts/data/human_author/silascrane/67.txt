Sure! The ghost has Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Compulsions in OCD can often involve counting and numbers, sometimes resulting in the person feeling strongly that some numbers are "good" and others "bad". It may even have a geometric component -- for example, meticulously arranging all the objects on a desk so that their edges are parallel with each other, and with the edge of the desk, and becoming distressed if any are out of alignment.

In the case of this ghost, he is bothered by odd numbers. The very thought of his dismembered body being found in an *odd* number of containers is so powerfully distressing to him, that it prevents him from moving on. This is also why he is so strongly moved by the description of the final destination of the redeemed that's given in the Bible. To him, heaven is a place of profound, transcendent evenness.
