Desember 4 1871,

Aint found no sign of gold yet. "Treasure Crick" my ass. Only got me a mess of skeeter bites fer my truble stomping around the damn woods.

Desember 6 1871,

Got a few shiny flakes in my pan and a powerful akin back to show fer two days squatted in the mud by the crick. Guess the damn skeeters went and told their chigger friends about me, cause now those littel basterds are nawin on me, too.

Desember 10 1871,

Found me a handful of nuggets the size of peas, but near got myself killed in the bargen. I herd tell that gold can sometime wash down the mountain, and collect at the bottom of a waterfall. Found a place there used to be a falls a while back afore some beavers upstream changed the direction of the crick, and set to diggin. Lost my head when I saw the sparkle, and dug into the hillside too fast. Set off a rockslide and almost got buried alive. Still gettin chawed on by skeeters and chiggers, and now theys ticks come fer supper too. Burnt off two on my leg, one from my arm. Still got one on my neck I can't quite get loose. 

Desember 12 1871,

Feelin poorly. Tick on my neck hurts all hell. Tried to look at it with little mirror in my shack and my shavin mirror together, but can't find the damn thing now. Don't think I'm seeing straight.

Desember 13 1871,

Think I got the fever. Hearing things that aint there.  Couldn't move much so I tried to read some. Even harder than usual.

Desember 14, 1871,

Saw a bear out the window. Did I leave the door ajar? Can't get up to check. Heard the bear nosin round the front. Told him to git, but he didn't listen. Then I heard someone else tell him to git, and he did. 

Desember 15, 1871,

Fever mighta broke. Still weak. Reading is getting easier though.

December 17th, 1871,

I feel better. Something has changed. 

December 18th, 1871,

I was sure my wrist was broken, but it seems perfectly hale, now. I must have been mistaken. Of the tick on the back of my neck, there is now no sign except a small lump beneath the flesh. This would be a cause for concern, but it is neither warm nor painful to the touch. Perhaps a lingering swelling? In any case, I feel ready to resume prospecting tomorrow.

December 20th, 1871,

I returned to the site of the old falls, to excavate more cautiously, this time.  Working carefully, I recovered almost three ounces of gold from the streambed. Additionally, I met a stranger on the way back to my cabin. The fellow said he'd come to the new world searching for a better life, free of the tyrannies and turmoil of the old. From that, I supposed that he must be a foreigner, though his accent did not sound like that of the Swedes or Poles I have met on my travels through the West. 

As I think about it, I do not recall exactly what his voice sounded like, nor even his appearance. He did not give his name, either. Strange.

December 23rd, 1871,

The tangled roots of a tree forestalled my digging, but they must have been ancient and rotten, for when I laid hold on them I found it a simple matter to rip them out of the ground and cast them aside, like pulling weeds in my mother's garden. The stranger asked to stay with me, offering to assist with my labor in exchange for his room and board. I cannot say why I trusted him, for he is surely an odd sort of man, but I somehow sense he bears me no ill will. Everything in his bearing tells me he is weary from his long journey, and grateful to have found shelter at last. He will not betray my trust.

December 24th, 1871,

The stranger and I recovered near a pound today, an appropriately kingly gift of gold for Christmas Eve. I would have accounted myself a miser, if I did not offer him a share, despite our prior agreement, but he has steadfastly refused, and assured me that I have already provided for his needs. A strange fellow indeed.

December 25th, 1871,

It is Christmas Day, and to my amazement there is a light dusting of snow. I had not thought to see it so low upon the mountain, in this mild climate.  Nonetheless, I have decided I will go down the mountain and into town, though I have plenty of rations for myself and the stranger. If he will take no gold for his labors, I shall at least properly show him how Christmas is celebrated in America. 

How strange, and yet how fitting, that I should find myself embracing a stranger from far away at Christmastide. To my surprise, he had not heard of the holiday! I can only assume it is known by another name in his homeland, which remains a mystery unfortunately. Wherever he is from, their customs are stranger than I had supposed: folk there, he tells me, do not even have first names! He asked if I would come up with a name for him, so that he might feel more at home in this land, so I have decided to call him John. You cannot go wrong with *John.*

January 1st, 1872,

I have learned much from John in the past few days. I learned a great deal even before that, as I realize now that I have had the opportunity to peruse my earlier journal entries. John, as the astute reader may have already guessed, is not man, but neither is he a beast, nor yet is he a spirit or devil. 

It seems that there are beings who are in body akin to the pests that plagued my early days at Treasure Creek, yet are even more closely akin to man, in spirit. One can scarcely imagine such a thing existing in this world, but then, one need only ponder the great expanse of the night sky to conclude that this world is not the only world in creation. And though we are children of two different worlds, I cannot but believe that we are also children of the same God. 

Where John differs from the mites, ticks, and mosquitoes, is that he does not merely steal to live. He takes, but also gives back in return, strengthening the mind and body of those in whose flesh he makes his home. 

John has made the world both larger and smaller -- larger with possibility, and yet vanishingly small, on the scale of all that is. Needless to say, the pursuit of gold, at least as an end in itself, has lost its luster for me.

Now I will set out on a larger adventure, for a greater prize. I will leave my old life and this book behind. If anyone finds it, they will doubtless conclude that I am mad, and laugh my words to scorn. 

But if anyone more discerning should happen upon my story, I refer them to the Bard of Avon, whom I have but recently acquired the necessary acumen to appreciate:

*There are more things in Heaven and Earth...than are dreamt of in your philosophy.*
