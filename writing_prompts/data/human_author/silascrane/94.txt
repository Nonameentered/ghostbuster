Struck by a blast of dark magic, Princess Allesandra stumbled backward, as the Vile Witch of Darkfen cackled madly.

"Poor child!" the wizened enchantress sneered, with mock sympathy. "You were so enamored of your delicate feminine grace, so proud of your beauty and womanly charms, as you thoughtlessly danced, and capered, and sang through my realm -- do you suddenly find those feet of yours less *light and dainty?"*

Allesandra's eyes widened, and she felt at her body, frantically. Her feet were not her first concern. She patted at her chest, which she found to be broad and flat. She patted at her legs, which she discovered were muscular and hairy. Cautiously, she reached between said legs...and found she was not a *she* at all!

*Prince Allen* leaped to his feet, and thrust his fists into the air.

"Scoofa!" he crowed, exuberantly.

The witch blinked in surprise. "What?"

Seizing the frilly pink dress he had been wearing by its now-sagging bodice, Prince Allen tore the garment asunder. He was shirtless beneath, but wore a pair of sturdy traveling breeches that must have been extremely baggy on him, moments before. Then he kicked off the ill-fitting pink dancing slippers on his feet, which had already torn the seams of the lightweight footwear, and pulled a pair of folded leather moccasins from a satchel  at his waist, the bulk of which had been concealed by the voluminous hoop skirt of his princess attire.

"What the hell is going on?" The witch demanded, clenching her bony fists in consternation.

The prince effected an awkward bow, occupied as he was with pulling on his moccasins. "The end of a long journey, my good woman! That was my fourth transmutation this month."

The witch furrowed her brow. "Fourth? In a *month?* How many enchanters have you pissed off, kid?"

He chuckled. "Only one, besides yourself. He turned me into a cat."

"A cat?" she exclaimed. "You were a princess!"

He nodded. "Indeed! But before that, I pissed off a wizard, who turned me into a cat."

"What happened then?" the witch asked, sounding genuinely curious.

Prince Allen stretched, limbering his now-considerable muscles. "Well, I don't know any magical spells myself, so I went looking for a ready-made way to change myself back. I snuck my fuzzy self into a curio shop after hours, one that was purported to traffic in magical items and other arcane contraband, according to the royal spymaster. Sure enough, tucked away in a storeroom, I found a genuine magic lamp."

"That's only *two* transformations, so I'm guessing you didn't word your wish very well." the witch mused.

"No indeed, madam, no indeed." Prince Allen confirmed, with a chuckle. "I rubbed the lamp with my little paw, and a genie popped out, as I had hoped. To my surprise, the spirit could even understand my feline speech. Glad to have someone to talk to again, I explained to him that I was really a prince, and that I'd been transformed into a cat by an evil wizard...and then I wished to *no longer be a cat."*

The witch slapped her wrinkled forehead. "Seriously?"

"I'm afraid so. The genie, with the malicious sense of humor typical of his kind, turned me into a *frog.* Worse still, this particular genie was the stingy sort who only has to grant *one* wish per master. But he assured me that -- as per tradition -- this *new* curse could be broken by a kiss from a princess." Allen went on. "Thus, whilst in amphibian form, I had to make my way to the next kingdom over, where I knew the nearest princess could be found. Once I made it to the pond in the palace gardens, I had to wait two horribly dull weeks among the other frogs -- who were, alas, just normal frogs, and hence not very good conversationalists -- for the princess to return from a holiday abroad."

"And then you got her to kiss you?" the witch asked, cocking her head to the side.

"Naturally. I mean, what princess *wouldn't* kiss a talking frog claiming to be a cursed prince -- just for the *story,* if nothing else?"

The old hag nodded, motioning for him to continue.

"Anyway, I explained my situation, she kissed me, and I was human again. But it turns out -- as I learned after perusing a few bestiaries in the palace library after the fact -- that frogs can sometimes spontaneously *change their sex."* Allen explained, ruefully. "Particularly if there are too many of one gender in the same habitat. Evidently, the palace garden's pond was a bit of a sausage fest, so after I lived there for a few weeks, fickle mother nature decided to assign me to the *other team,* to even things out a bit. Since the species of frog I became isn't very sexually dimorphic, I didn't even notice that it had happened. Breaking the genie's curse reverted my species, but not my gender, which had changed *non-magically* while I was a frog.*"*

The witch cackled in amazement. "Incredible, all that work to turn yourself back, only to discover that you'd become a woman in the process! And yet, you seem to have embraced femininity remarkably fast. What with all the dancing and singing through the woods near my home, nattering on about how much you loved being a pretty girl..."

The witch trailed off, narrowing her eyes, as realization began to dawn on her.

"Oh, you tricky little son of a bitch." she hissed.

Allen grinned. "Well, you weren't exactly likely to help me out of the goodness of your heart, were you? I mean, let's face it: you're not known as the Vile Witch of Darkfen because of your sweet disposition and propensity for aiding those in need."

"You think you can just come into my demesne, and make use of my magic for *nothing?"* the enchantress snarled, sickly purple bolts beginning to crackle around her skeletal fingers.

"Nothing? I did a lot of *hard work* to get you to help me!" Allen protested, with mock indignance. "I had to go pick out a wardrobe, learn dozens of tricky dance steps -- I even learned every single note of *'I Enjoy Being A Girl',* all to deceive you into thinking that the worst thing you could possibly do to me was turn me into a man!*"*

The witch snorted. "Very clever, little princeling, very clever." She raised her hands, the magical energy arcing between them intensifying.

"I look forward to seeing how you apply that cleverness to finding a way to change yourself back from being *a pile of charred bones."* she growled, thrusting her arms forward, and releasing a torrent of lethal magic at the Prince...

...a torrent of lethal magic which instantly rebounded from an invisible barrier around the young royal, and instead struck the witch full in the chest. She shrieked in pain and horror for only a split second, before her own spell burned her flesh to ash, and her blackened skeleton collapsed to the ground.

"Scoofa times two!" Allen cheered, thrusting a clenched fist skyward.

He stepped out of the hidden magic circle he'd pretended to stumble backward into when the witch changed him back into a man. He hadn't lied about not being able to cast any magic spells, he was no wizard.

*Magic circles,* on the other hand, could be inscribed by anyone who knew the correct runes, and could obtain a few costly material components with which to write them out on a surface. After he'd done that, concealing the circle with leaf litter from the forest floor had been trivial.

Prince Allen took a deep breath, oriented himself towards the nearest road, and started walking, purposefully.

There was, he recalled, a very charming princess who lived just one kingdom over. What's more, he knew based on what had been an extremely awkward experience with her, that she was both a *very* good kisser, and *exclusively* interested in men.
