Kythain stopped at the foot of the stairs leading to the royal dais, his battered armor ringing sharply against the marble as he knelt before King Alendev. Visten hastily copied his friend, wincing and placing a hand on Kythain's pauldron to steady himself as his aching muscles protested the move.

The young monarch made a sweeping gesture."Rise, Kythain Elar, Visten Marigrove. I desire no such obeisance from the men who avenged my parents' murder, and laid low the Red Lord, sending his armies fleeing back across the Eastern Sea."

Kythain rose at once, and then turned to lend Visten a hand, helping him back to his feet as the wiry young mage stifled an exasperated groan. They both gave the monarch a grateful bow from the waist.

The king extended a hand to the weary warrior and mage before him, raising his voice in proclamation. "Kythain Elar, worthy bannerman of the crown, hear the proclamation of the sovereign you have served so well and faithfully: the lands that once belonged to the traitor Duke Lendig are now yours! I hereby name you Duke Kythain of Westholm!"

The court, breaking the somber mood that had descended upon it during the war, erupted in applause at the bestowal that raised the heroic Kythain from a common soldier to the high nobility. Alendev motioned for silence, and when the throne was quiet, he continued, turning to Visten.

"And you, Magus Visten, wise beyond your years, and powerful in your clever craft," the king began, before pausing to glance at Archmage Valdemar, who stood beside the throne."In consultation with my court wizard, I hereby name you a Master Wizard of the Royal Cabal, and a bestow a grant of royal funds with which you may build a tower of your own, as befits your new station."

Visten's jaw dropped -- scarcely out of his apprenticeship, the journeyman wizard's lifelong dream of an appointment to the Cabal had been fulfilled at a stroke.

"I am told that there is a rocky hill overlooking the city of *Westholm,* not far from the *ducal keep,* that would be a fine site for a tower." Alendev added, with a knowing smirk, sending a chuckle through the surrounding courtiers.

Visten and Kythain glanced at each other, briefly, both frowning in confusion.

"I am humbled by your generosity, majesty" Kythain said, recovering his composure and affecting another deep bow.

"As am I, sire." Visten agreed, mimicking the motion.

"That is but a token of my gratitude," Alendev said, with a dismissive wave, as he took up a goblet of wine offered to him by a page. He raised it to the newly minted noble before him. "Duke Kythain, for the service you have rendered to myself and the kingdom, I invite you to ask any boon that you desire, unto the half of my kingdom!"

Kythain swallowed hard. Making his deepest bow yet, he stammered, "My king...if...if you would ask me to name a boon, I..."

"Anything!" Alendev assured him, raising his goblet to his lips. "Name it, Duke Kythain -- it would be beneath my royal honor to do any less for the man to whom I owe everything."

"I ask permission to pay court upon your sister, Princess Alessandra!" Kythain blurted.

Alendev sputtered, choking on his wine. Nearby on the dais, Alessandra gasped, placing a hand to her chest, her cheeks coloring. She stared wide-eyed at Kythain, looking from him to Visten, and then at her brother the king.

Kythain lifted his chin. "I...I know that I am of humble birth, sire, but--"

Alendev shook his head, coughing, and waving away Kythain's response. "N-no, no Duke Kythain! I just..." He trailed off, looking at the Princess, who despite having become befriended the celebrated soldier during the war, was looking at Kythain as though she was seeing him for the very first time. She looked back at her brother, her blush deepening, and gave him a faint nod. "...well, as my royal sister seems amenable, I, uh, am more than willing to grant this request, I just, well..."

The king trailed off, leaving the throne room in awkward silence for a moment.

Visten, meanwhile, was frowning thoughtfully, seemingly pondering the situation. His eyes suddenly widened, and he drew in a sharp breath. Wordlessly, he took a single step to the side, increasing  the distance between himself and Kythain, who didn't notice, as he was too busy beaming up at the Princess and King.

"Thank you, your majesty!" Kythain said, smiling broadly. The Princess, having recovered some of her composure, mirrored Kythain's expression with a shy smile of her own.

The victory gala in honor of the newly-minted Duke and Master Wizard proceeded, with much feasting, wine, song, and dance. The king discussed the duties of a duke and the extent of his domain with Kythain. Archmage Valdemar discussed the finer points of tower construction with Visten. And the Princess, via royal messenger, made arrangements to take a stroll with Kythain in the royal gardens the following week.

As the celebration wound down, Kythain found himself alone on a balcony overlooking the palace garden.

"Wizards that father a child," Visten announced, "Often sire offspring that are magical sports -- possessed of strange innate magical talents. They can be hard to parent. I just found that out from Archmage Valdemar tonight. It's something most apprentices are taught, apparently, when first learning magical safety."

Kythain glanced towards his friends voice. He saw no one there. He frowned.

"Really?  Why didn't you already know?"

"My master -- like everyone else, apparently -- thought it was information I wouldn't ever *need* to know." Visten replied, drily.

"That's strange. I'd certainly want to know that, if I were you." Kythain mused, idly. Then he waved towards the seemingly empty air next to him. "Vis, why are you *invisible* right now? Is something wrong?"

"No, I just don't want to be..." Visten began, then sighed. "Look, Ky, I don't want to make this any weirder than it already is, but you should know that..."

"But what?" Kythain said, raising an eyebrow. "Vis, we've been friends forever. We're like *brothers.* You know you can talk to me about anything."

Visten was silent for a moment, then he reappeared in a shower of arcane sparks, shedding the cloaking spell he'd been wearing.

"You know what?" the wizard said, with a wry smirk. "Never mind."

He threw an arm around his friend's shoulders, "Come on, let's go back to the party. You might have your heart set on Allesandra, but I remember you promised to introduce *me* to some of the ladies in waiting that you know?"

Kythain raised his eyebrows. "I did!" He waggled his fingers mystically. "But you always say you're too busy studying the *mystical secrets of the universe* to waste time on earthly entanglements."

"Yeah, well," Visten muttered, darkly "It's recently occurred to me that I've been putting off my social life for far too long."

Kythain laughed, jovially. "Great! I know just the lass -- her name's Evelyn. She's pretty, witty -- plus, the girl loves *books,* just like you. I'm pretty sure I saw her downstairs earlier."

Visten swallowed nervously, but nodded.

Kythain chuckled, herding his friend back towards the waning celebration. "Don't worry, she's really nice. And I'll put in a good word for you."

"Women *do* always seem to trust you." Visten said, drily, and allowed himself to be led back to the feast.
