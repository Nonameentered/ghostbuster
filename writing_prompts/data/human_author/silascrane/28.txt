"So, how come I haven't met any other Threx?" Melanie asked her diminutive, insectoid co-worker.
  

  
Threx looked up from their cheese sandwich, and cocked an antenna at her. "How would we know that?"
  

  
Melanie frowned. "You're a hivemind, aren't you?"
  

  
Threx kicked their legs idly as they dangled over the edge of the suspended alloy girder where they were sitting and eating lunch with Melanie. "I mean, we're not so much eusocial, as we are each appendages of one big, distributed individual. So what?"
  

  
"Doesn't that mean there should be a lot of you?" Melanie pressed.
  

  
"A 'lot' is relative, Melly." Threx replied, and then paused to snip away another corner of the sandwich with their mandibles. "There's under 11,000 Threx on this planet -- by my species' standards, Threx is a very tiny hive."
  

  
Melanie nodded. "Sure, but thousands of people work here. Don't you work more efficiently together?"
  

  
"Yeah." Threx replied, and then simply continued eating.
  

  
Melanie rolled her eyes. "So, why are you the only Threx who works here?"
  

  
"Actually, one other Threx works here, but that part of us is up in the planning office. Anyway, we don't take a bunch of the same job because we think that taking the widest variety of high-risk positions gives us the greatest opportunity for success."
  

  
"Success at wha--" Melanie began to ask, but suddenly, Threx's compound eyes bulged.
  

  
"Melly, look out!" the little alien suddenly cried, and gave her a hard shove forward. Threx was surprisingly strong for their size, and the push sent Melanie flying off the girder, to land with a thump on the nearby scaffolding.
  

  
Then, before either of the pair could react further, a heavy steel cargo container fell from above and struck the girder, ringing it like a gong. Threx had sprung backward after pushing Melanie clear, but not quickly enough. The implacable weight of the falling metal crate smashed Threx's lower half between itself and the girder.
  

  
Melanie screamed, both in horror and in warning to those below, as the crate deflected off the girder with a resounding clang, and continued it's fall...along with what remained of Threx.
  

  
A half hour later, Melanie sat on short stack of polymer wall panels at the base of the construction site. She had nothing but a few light bruises from her short fall onto the scaffolding, but she ached for a different reason as she watched the bio-bag containing Threx's body being loaded onto the ambulance as it departed.
  

  
The foreman had told her she'd could have the rest of the day off, but despite being relatively uninjured, she felt like she couldn't move. Threx had given their life for hers, without hesitation. The weight of that bore down on her as if she too had been pinned under the er plummetting crate.
  

  
Melanie felt a light touch on her shoulder. She turned to look, and saw Threx standing beside her. She was only surprised for a moment.
  

  
"You're...you must be the other Threx. The one who works in planning?"
  

  
Threx clicked his mandibles in way Melanie had learned to recognize as amusement. "Melly...come on. Do you still not get it?"
  

  
Melanie blinked, surprised by the alien's familiarity.
  

  
Threx hissed out a surprisingly human sigh. "I've told you before -- being a hivemind doesn't just mean we're all connected. It means that, despite the nomenclature we use to avoid confusing monocorporeals like yourself, there is no 'we.' I am Threx! Not a different Threx, or a copy of Threx, but the same Threx."
  

  
Melanie ignored Threx's next words, as well as his outraged thrashing, as she seized the alien off his feet and hugged him tightly to her chest. After a moment, she gently set the protesting creature down, and dabbed her eyes.
  

  
"S-sorry," Melanie stammered, then swallowed. "It's just I...I..."
  

  
"I know, I know." Threx soothed. "I thought you'd be upset, it's one reason why I came down to talk to you first instead of leaving immediately."
  

  
"Leaving?" Melanie asked.
  

  
"Paid bereavement leave. One of my biological siblings was crushed to death by a falling girder, only a few dozen meters away from my workstation." Threx explained.
  

  
"But you just said..." Melanie trailed off, her eyes widening in realization.
  

  
"Now you're getting it. On a planet this highly developed, it's hard to get a real, viable hive started up. I've got a lot of hands, sure, but everything I need costs money -- and land to house me is especially expensive. I can barely make ends meet, let alone invest in the real estate I need." Threx explained. "But fortunately, most humans are like you were -- they don't really understand what I am."
  

  
"Losing that one Threx was nothing to you!" Melanie cried.
  

  
"Well, not nothing." Threx protested. "It really hurt! Kind of like a...like a stubbed toe for one of you humans. But your labor and liability laws, as would be expected, are written from your perspective."
  

  
"You're going to clean up on this!" Melanie accused.
  

  
Threx nodded, eagerly. "Workman's comp, wrongful death suits, paid bereavement -- I should net eight or nine figures on this 'stubbed toe', once the smoke clears."
  

  
Melanie just stared at her alien friend in silent amazement. When the silence grew awkward, he cleared his breathing spicules, and continued.
  

  
"Anyway, that brings me to the second reason I came down." Threx went on. "Now that I am getting an infusion of capital, I'm going to want a trustworthy human liaison to help me manage my finances and represent my interests. Might you be interested in trying out a lucrative new career path, Melly?"
