"And so ends of the line of Elgernon." the Dark Lector, said, coldly, as he kicked the young prince's corpse into the chasm with a sneer of contempt, and this is bullshit, 1500 pages and this is how it ends. His helmet was off and everything, that was definitely Ulric. Shit, and he used his last Phoenix Potion to save Narak earlier, remember? Terianthrix can't swoop in and save him, either, his wing got wounded by a ballista bolt. He's really dead! 

Narak, the great Fey hound snarled, digging his massive paws into the ground and struggling to rise, but the poison in the dozens of goblin darts peppering his shaggy hide had at last done its work, and he collapsed, unable to stand. Lifting his bloodstained muzzle to the sky, he bayed plaintively, as though mourning his fallen frie--oh my god, please, not the doggo too! What the fuck, come on. You remember when he was a fey puppy, and Ulric had to chase him around the enchanted grove? That was cute as shit, and now everything sucks.

Diarmaid slunk to his master's side, a wicked grin on his sallow face. "Congratulations, master. It seems only one other task remains for us this day."

The Dark Lector snorted. "The rebels are all but routed already -- and without their vaunted leader, they'll break and run before dawn." Shit, he's probably right. Oh man, Boros and the dwarves are with the rebels, they were so funny -- and the fairy kin from the grove? Man this is bullshit, f\*\*k this story.

Diarmaid shook his head. "Not that, master -- another matter."

The Dark Lector raised an eyebrow. "And what is--" He never finished the sentence, as Diarmaid drew his curved dagger, and rammed it into his master's guts. Did that little pissant finally grow some balls? Who gives a shit, at this point, though? 

"You still have to greet your dark master in hell!" Diarmaid snarled. As he withdrew his dagger, the weapon seemed to writhe as though alive, become a long, straight rapier, etched with flowing elven...wait a minute, isn't that Ulric's sword, how did this asshole get it? He had it when the Dark Lector killed him a minute ago...

As the Dark Lector stared in horror, the figure of Diarmaid warped and changed, becoming that of OH MY GOD, REMEMBER THE AMULET OF CHANGING FROM 500 PAGES AGO?!! IT'S F\*\*\*ING ULRIC HE SWAPPED APPEARANCES WITH DIARMAID WHEN THE FIGHT STARTED WHILE DORK LECTOR WAS DISTRACTED, WHAT THE F\*\*\* YES, LET'S F\*\*\*ING GOOOOOOOOO!
