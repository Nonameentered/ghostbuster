"You're...the Reaper?" James whispered hoarsely to the figure above his hospital bed.

The young man smiled, and nodded. "Yes."

His answer was incongruous with his appearance. He was handsome and youthful, if a bit scruffy and unshaven, with bright green eyes and a ready smile. He wore no ominous black robes, but instead was dressed in jeans and a canvas work shirt, and had a battered John Deere baseball cap perched atop his mop of sun-lightened sandy blonde hair. 

When James was silent for few moments, the Reaper raised his eyebrows. "Not what you were expecting?"

James cleared his throat. "Not exactly. Sorry."

The Reaper chuckled. "Don't be. I'm used to it."

The young man extended a hand, and James took it readily. He was too tired, and in too much pain, to do otherwise. The Reaper's grip tightened, and the stranger abruptly pulled him out of bed and onto his feet. His withered legs hadn't been able to support him in months, but they were steady beneath him, now. 

In the same instant, he found that he was no longer in his hospital bed. He stood on a well-trodden pathway in a field of golden wheat that seemed to stretch out into infinity, with clear sky of deep autumnal blue above. The Reaper stood before him, and grinned as he released his hand. The young man gestured for James to follow him, and he did. 

"You're...pretty cheerful, for *Death."* James commented, after they'd walked a few yards down the path.

"Oh, I'm not Death." The Reaper corrected. "I'm *the Reaper."* 

James furrowed his brow. "Same difference, I thought?"

The young man shook his head. "Nah. Cultural misunderstanding. Do you know where the term 'reaper' comes from?"

James thought for a moment, and then winced uncomfortably. "Um...I think I remember something from Sunday school, but..."

The Reaper laughed again. "Don't worry. Faith is what matters in this place, not scholarship. Let me refresh your memory: there's a parable about harvesting a field of wheat...?"

James nodded slowly, that did ring a bell. "Right...there are both weeds and wheat growing in a field, and the farmer tells his farmhands -- his reapers, I guess -- to let them both grow until the harvest, when the weeds can be sorted out. Is that where the term comes from? What does that have to do with death?"

"It is." the Reaper said, with a nod. Then he reached out and plucked a dry stalk of wheat from the field, and held it up. "Notice anything about it?"

James shook his head. "Not really."

"It's dried out, brittle." The Reaper explained. "It was dead before I plucked it." He indicated the plump grains on the end of the stalk. "Reapers don't *kill.* We just harvest what's ready to be harvested: the seeds of a new life. There's nothing *grim* about it."

James nodded slowly, looking around the endless field.

The Reaper thrust his hands into his pockets as they walked on, and sighed wistfully. "Back when we were first called 'reapers', people understood better what it meant, because their lives were mostly centered around the fields. The reaping, the *harvest,* that's when things die, yes, but it's also fulfillment, abundance, and gathering in. It's both joy and sadness, but the joy of what's ahead far exceeds the sadness that's left behind..."

The Reaper trailed off, as James caught the scent of smoke as they walked on. They entered a clearing in the grain, in the center of which was a smouldering mound of burning weeds. Other workers dressed like the Reaper were busily tossing bundles of the noxious plants onto the foul-smelling bonfire.

"...assuming, of course," the Reaper added solemnly as they passed the crackling fire and continued onward, "That you're not one of the *weeds."*
