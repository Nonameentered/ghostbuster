"Who did this to you?" Carla, the young medium whispered, as I floated beside her, and we both stared down into the little hollow between two small hills. Below us, eleven black plastic garbage bags lay in a pile, clumsily covered by some dead branches and brush.

Each one contained a chunk of meat and bone that had been me.

"His name is Lamar Hayes." I replied. "He drives a blue Dodge. Do you want to write this down, Carla?" She nodded, in the process of pulling a notebook out her backpack. I began to recite a long list of details I remembered about my killer, who'd killed me in a robbery gone wrong, and then decided to try to make the evidence disappear. He didn't do a very good job.

"Wow," Carla said, blinking, as she finished writing down my murderer's details. "That's...a lot more than I usually get."

"I always remembered things. It didn't change when I died."

She let out a long breath. "Don't worry, we'll get this bastard -- I promise."

She started to turn away, but I floated over in front of her.

"Where are you going?" I asked.

She frowned. "Well, I have some work to do, before I can turn this Lamar guy in. See, I can't tell the police that a ghost led me to his dismembered body and identified his murderer, so I have to sort of *launder* the information--"

I shook my head. "But, that's not why I brought you here."

"You didn't...want justice for your death?" she said, cocking her head to one side.

I paused. "Lamar, he...he shouldn't hurt anyone else. Yes. You should do that. But after this, please. Did you bring gloves, Carla? Remember earlier, when I told you that I could show you where my body was, and I said you should bring gloves?"

"Oh! Yes..." she said, fishing a pair of latex gloves out of her pocket. "Why *did* you want me to bring these, anyway?"

I explained it to her.

She looked at me for a long time.

"Did you not understand?" I asked. "What I want is--"

"No, I heard you." she interrupted. "I just...I mean..." She sighed. "Alright, if that's what you need to move on..."

She put on the gloves, and made her way down into the hollow. She pulled her shirt up to cover her nose and mouth, and then began to open one of the bags.

"The afterlife is real, Carla." I said.

"I know that. I'm a medium." she said, her voice muffled through her shirt. "Oh God, the smell..."

"Do you know what Heaven is like, Carla?" I said. I felt excited and happy thinking about it, though I'd never been good at showing that with my voice or my face. "Do you know what it *is?"*

"Can't say I do...ugh, this is so gross." she complained, then continued. "My clients are people who haven't gotten all the way there yet, so it's not really my department, I guess."

"You don't have to go there to know. It *says* what it is, in the Bible, Carla. Right at the end. Revelations. Revelations 21, verse 16, and verse 17." I told her, as she opened a second one of the bags, and emptied the first into it.

She climbed back up out of the hollow, holding the empty bag, and looked at me, her brow furrowed.

"Heaven," I explained, tears forming in my eyes, as overwhelming joy welled up inside me that, even dead, I still wasn't quite sure how to express.  "Is a city. It is a city that is 1380 miles high, 1380 miles deep, and 1380 miles wide."

She blinked. "It's like a cube...?" Then her eyes widened. I think that meant that she started to understand. "A perfect cube. And every side is *even."*

I nodded, too happy to talk. I started to feel warm. "Thank you, Carla. Thank you for helping." I finally managed to say, as light enveloped me. I pointed up. "I'll tell them. I'll tell them you helped me."

She smiled at me. I think she finally understood, at least a little.

As warm light drew me in, and began to take me away, I looked back down at my body. There it was, cut up inside ten plastic trash bags. *Ten.* Five and five more. It was even. It was *perfect.*

Like Heaven.
