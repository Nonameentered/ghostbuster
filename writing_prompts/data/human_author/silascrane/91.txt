"And so that's the problem, my dear villainous varlet -- no one understands my offbeat compatriots and me! " Kid Hatter complained, crossing his arms, huffily. "Anyway, Countess Whimsica said her talk with you helped her understand this entirely too-stodgy era. Despite being on the wrong side of the law, you clearly had a great deal in common with us, yet you’ve been here all your life, whereas we only just arrived. And so here I am, hat in hand -- well, hat on head, haha!"

Kid Hatter then spun in a circle and thrust his hand skyward, clutching his oversized tophat. There was a burst of purple smoke in the air above him, and a dozen tiny bowler hats with tiny arms, legs, and eyes materialized out of thin air, parachuted to the ground, and then joined their little hands and began to dance in a circle around the teenage hero. He spread his arms, took a bow, re-donned his hat, and then looked up at the man he'd just poured his heart out to.

Jester Crimson sat atop the throne that was the centerpiece of his lair in an abandoned medieval theme park. The throne was styled in the manner of an immense Jack-in-the-Box, raised above the floor of the old theme park's main exposition hall on a colorful dais, allowing him to glare down at the young hero from an elevated position.

Kid Hatter, for his part, seemed entirely unfazed by the supervillain's baleful stare, despite the fact that he was indeed aware that they were, ostensibly, enemies, and he had put himself at a grave disadvantage by walking right into the man's stronghold.

The Jester sagged forward on his high seat and sighed heavily. "I keep telling you kids to *pass it along* to the rest! Why do you little bastards keep coming to me?"

Kid Hatter shrugged, an action that was mimicked by his horde of little hat-people. "I tried asking the Countess what you'd told her, but she seemed intent on keeping mum, old bean. I gathered her ladyship was a bit embarrassed, for some odd reason."

"Yeah." Jester Crimson said, flatly. "I can't imagine what could possibly be embarrassing about you guys."

"I know!" Kid Hatter exclaimed, straightening his enormous polka-dot bowtie, and placing his hands on his hips over his metallic green tailcoat.

Crimson rolled his eyes. "Okay, let's get this over with: you know how you kids are...*queer,* right?"

"The *queerest!"* Kid Hatter affirmed, beaming, proudly. "Why, long ago, we were imbued with the very essence of queer!"

Crimson winced, holding up a hand. "Listen, I know your little club’s origin story, we don't need to--"

Ignoring Jester's attempt to forestall him, Kid Hatter produced a flash of light and another puff of purple smoke. When the smoke cleared he'd adopted a melodramatic, bardic pose, one hand over his heart, and another raised upwards. "You see, long ago, we were mundane high school students involved in an ordinary book club -- not an ounce of queerness among us!"

"Please stop." The villain pleaded, placing two fingers onto each of his temples, and groaning.

Kid Hatter soldiered on. "Until one day, in the darkest reaches of the library stacks, we discovered an ancient book of fairy tales!"

"I've literally heard this story twelve times, this week."

"It turned out, an evil wizard had imprisoned an actual fairy in the book! He was an odd little spirit of surreal fun and whimsy -- a *queerness elemental,* one might say. So grateful was he for his release from the book, that he gave all thirteen of us a different queer magical power -- thus, we became *The Thirteen Queeroes!"* Kid Hatter explained.

"Okay, let's try to move this along -- when was this?"

"Fall 1922, in our freshman year of high school." Kid Hatter answered.

"And then what happened?" Jester prompted.

"Well, naturally, we used our powers to spread justice and queerness throughout the region, until--"

"Until your senior year, right. And then what?"

Kid Hatter frowned thoughtfully. "Well, the fairy re-appeared, and said he had gazed into the future, and foresaw a dark era that would arise a hundred years hence, when the world would become a dour and humdrum place, desperately in need of our brand of delightfully merry queerness."

Crimson nodded, "And so he used his magic to send you guys a century into the future, which brings us up to now. But you’ve been getting some odd reactions to your particular…*style,* of superheroics. Particularly your nomenclature. Am I right?”

Kid Hatter nodded emphatically. “Indeed, stout yeoman. Why, I saved a woman from a purse-snatcher earlier today, and then doffed my hat, and told her to ‘have a queer day’.  *Apropos of nothing,* she somberly told me ‘it gets better’ and handed me *this thing.”*

The young superhero held out his hand, and a little Pride flag appeared in a puff of purple smoke, held between thumb and forefinger like a bug. “It was nice of her to give me a present, I suppose, but I can’t be seen carrying this around -- we’re an *international* group of heroes. I don’t even know what country it’s from!” He made the flag disappear again. “Besides, a rainbow with a few extra colors tacked on? That’s not nearly queer enough to go with *my* ensemble.”

“Kid,” Jester Crimson said, patiently. “There’s this thing called ‘linguistic drift’, where words change meaning over time--”

“Obviously!” Kid Hatter agreed, folding his arms. “And we’re here to teach these poor stuffy lumpkins the *true meaning* of queer!”

“That’s the thing, though--”

“And it’s why we need your help, you’re the queerest person we’ve met, in this era!”

“Uh, yeah, about that--”

“And so, though in matters of law and order we stand opposed, let us collaborate as fellow connoisseurs of queer, my good fellow!”

“Okay, okay! I can see you’re going to be one of the hard cases. Just…hang on a second.” Crimson said, holding up a hand. Reaching down into his jack-in-the-box throne, he rummaged around for a few moments, and then pulled out a small brochure, tossing it to Kid Hatter.

“Here, read this. I got it from some queer activists who were passing ‘em out by the college.” the villain said.

"Ah! Fellow travelers on the path of the queer and whimsical? Delightful! Let's see what merry jests our compatriots have penned for our present perusal..."

Kid Hatter opened the pamphlet and began to read. Jester Crimson drummed his fingers on the rim of the jack-in-the-box impatiently, as the young hero’s eyes slowly began to widen, and his jaw dropped at an equally glacial pace.

Finally, he looked up at the supervillain, staring at him in mute disbelief.

“Yeah.” the villain said, nodding.

Kid Hatter looked down at the pamphlet again, then back up at the villain. Crimson imagined he was recalling every encounter he’d had with the general public since arriving in the 21st century. Finally, the young hero cleared his throat.

“Well.” Kid Hatter said, briskly, turning on his heel, towards the exhibition hall’s exit. “I’ll see myself out, then.”

“You do that.” Jester Crimson said, drily.
