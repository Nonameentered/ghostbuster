"I have been delivering babies for over 30,000 cycles now, *madam."* Dr. Zybrylx said, as she indignantly smoothed down her light magenta lab coat with one of her innumerable translucent psuedopods. "I have hatched, birthed, pupated, or otherwise ushered in the offspring of hundreds of different species across three galaxies. As such, I can *assure* you, the larva you hold is, indeed, *your* spawn, and no one else's."

Melody felt a moment of uncertainty, as she looked down at the baby. He *was* very adorable. And, as the doctor had pointed out, the little colored polymer ID band they put on the baby's wrist matched the band they put on her wrist. But his big brown eyes gave her pause, as both Melody and her husband, Hank, had *blue* eyes.

Also, the baby's torso seemed to be attached at the waist to the sleek, equine body of a newborn foal. 

Melody shook her head firmly. No, this was *not* her child, no matter how intelligent and offended the doctor sounded. Hank was always encouraging her to be more assertive -- this seemed like something she *really* needed to put her foot down on.

"How could *he* possibly have been inside of my body, a couple hours ago?" Melody protested, gesturing to the drowsy foal-baby she held. He was rather awkwardly draped over her in her hospital bed with his four gangly legs splayed out at odd angles, and she thought it was clear the dimensions didn't add up.

Dr. Zybrylx sighed, wistfully, clasping several of her psuedopods over her heart, which Melody could see beating inside of the physicians nearly transparent thorax. "I know! Motherhood is miraculous, isn't it? I remember when I budded off *my* first larva cluster, I--"

"No," Melody interrupted, crossly. "That wasn't a statement of *wonder,* it was genuine disbelief. I clearly was not carrying something this size inside me for nine months!"

"Oh don't be silly." the doctor replied, with a dismissive wave of an amorphous limb. "He was just all folded up and compressed, when he was sealed in your brood pouch."

"My *what?"* Melody exclaimed.

"Your--good galaxies, girl, did no one ever explain how this works? Alright, here goes: you see, when two sentients with sufficiently similar genetic structures and complementary chromosome patterns decide to propagate together--" 

"I know how sex works, and I also know I don't have a pouch!" Melody shouted. The foal began to stir uneasily, and Melody shushed him, awkwardly rocking him until he settled back down.

"You might call it your grub pocket, or maybe larva-bubble? I don't know all the slang you kids have for your reproductive organs these days, but "brood pouch" is the proper clinical term. Anyway, just look how he responds to you, you're obviously his mom." Dr. Zybrylx said, fondly, before waving a pseudopod at Melody, admonishingly. "Don't get too attached just yet, though -- remember, once your mate gets here, we need to get that kid stuffed into *his* brood pouch for the next phase of gestation as soon as possible. The latest neo-natal research says that the fourth septemester of gestation should ideally be initiated before the baby's outer membrane starts to harden in the open air, you know."

"Were any of those hundreds of species whose babies you delivered *humans?"* Melody asked, suspiciously.

The doctor rolled several of her dozen eyes. "Look, ma'am, I know everyone thinks *their* species is unique and special, but most biology is surprisingly uniform across the universe. Trust me, I've worked on plenty of warm-blooded vertebrates, such as yourself."

Before she could respond, Melody was distracted by a rhythmic tapping sound -- which turned out to be the sound of hooves slapping on the tile floor. What appeared to be a very tired-looking female centaur stood in the door to Melody's room, holding a tiny blue-eyed newborn. The baby wore a wristband the same color as that of his ostensible mother, but notably had only two legs.

"Hey, uh, doctor," the centaur woman said, drowsily, swaying slightly on her four feet. "I don't know if it's the prenatal analgesics still tripping me out and I just forgot, but I think it's been a couple hours and my baby hasn't even *tried* to stand up yet. Is he okay?" She held the newborn up before her face, squinting at him appraisingly, as she turned him from side to side. "Um, and I also can't seem to find the rest of his legs..."

Dr. Zybrylx threw up her psuedopods in consternation. "For the galaxy's sake! Why do I get all the crazy ones?" she demanded, crossly.
