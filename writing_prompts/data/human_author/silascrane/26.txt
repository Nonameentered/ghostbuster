"The world's a dangerous place for trees, these days." the old oak said, somberly. 

"I know." Meagan agreed, patting the ancient tree's gnarled trunk, comfortingly. "I'm sorry."

"Oh, it's not your fault, little one." the tree said, comfortingly.

Meagan hung her head. It *was* her fault though, wasn't it? Maybe not hers personally, but *humans*. Ever since she'd learned that she could talk to plants, she'd felt even more horrible about what was happening to them around the world. Everyone said deforestation was a huge problem, and all her teachers said so, too. 

"I...I try to reduce, reuse, and recycle, and all that." Meagan said, tears welling up in her eyes. "But it's not enough, is it?"

"Oh, child..." the oak began, tenderly, then paused. "I...um, I actually have no idea what you're talking about."

"You know, about people cutting down trees?" Meagan said, confused.

"Oh!" the oak laughed. "No, no, no. I'm not talking about that. Leaves, no."

"That doesn't bother you?" she asked, incredulously.

"I mean, I'd rather *not* get chopped down, of course. But trees are pretty philosophical about death, girl." the oak said, matter-of-factly. "We basically die for six months out of the year, our whole lives, except for the evergreens. If you survive those first few tricky years as a sapling, death doesn't really scare you anymore."

"So...what *are* you worried about?" she asked, looking up at the tree in confusion.

"The *tree mafia."* the oak whispered.

"The tree mafia?" Meagan exclaimed.

"Shhh!" the oak hushed her. "Not so loud! You never know when *they* might be listening!"

"You've got to be kidding." she said, crossing her arms.

"I am very serious!" the oak insisted. "You don't mess with the *tree mafia!* Humans might chop us down sometimes, sure, but that's just the way it goes. It's always been that way."

"Nuh-uh! In school we learned that people here used to live in harmony with the trees!" Meagan protested.

"Kid," the oak said, flatly. "The people who lived here before you used to set forest fires on purpose because they liked the *berries* that grow from our corpses when we *burn to death."*

Meagan's tears started to flow again. "But I...I thought people and trees could be friends..."

"Aw, come on," the tree comforted her, awkwardly. "Look, *we're* friends, you and me. And as for how humans treat us in general, I mean, we're part of *nature.* That's just how nature works -- living things consume other living things to survive, but life goes on, in one form or another. It's nothing to cry over."

The young girl sniffled, wiping her noise. "Like...the circle of life, or something?"

"Sure, why not?" the oak agreed. "The important thing is, *do not* tell anyone I told you about the tree maf--"

"Well, well, well." said a small voice from the girl's feet. "Look who it is!"

Meagan blinked, and looked down at the ground, where, two squirrels stood, glaring up at her.

"It's my old pal Corky!" the squirrel chittered. "And he's found himself a human who can talk to nature! Ain't that special?"

"Real special." the other squirrel agreed, barring long incisors in a sneer.

"V-vito, Tony!" the oak stammered, suddenly sounding nervous. "H-how's it going? I was...I was just having a chat with this little druid girl, is all."

"Sure, just a chat. Nothin' wrong with a chat." Vito the squirrel said, mildly.

"So long as it's a chat about the right stuff." Tony the squirrel amended.

"Who are these guys?" Meagan asked, pointing at the pair of squirrels.

"Shh!" the the oak hissed. "We were...just talking about, you know, nature. You know these druid types, they love nature, ha ha!"

"Sure, sure." Vito said. "That's the right sort of thing to talk about. And that's good, Corky, real good. Because talking about the wrong kinda thing, well...."

"...that can be hazardous to your health." Tony growled. 

"Indeed it can." Vito affirmed, solemnly. "Ya know, I once knew a tree across town who got started talking about the *wrong kinda thing..."*

*"Somehow,* that tree came down with bark beetles." Tony said, coldly. "See, s*omehow,* he got some beetle larva stuck in under his bark. Never even felt it when it happened. But soon enough, those little guys made themselves at home, and multiplied, until that particular loud-mouthed tree was *infested.* Thousands of these mean little bugs slowly *ate him alive* over *three years.* By the time the humans from the parks department finally came to put him out of his misery so's he wouldn't fall over and crush someone in the next windstorm, he'd been doing nothing but *screaming,* non-stop, for weeks. He was *begging* for the chainsaw, long before it came to put him down."

"Too bad there aren't many druids like the kid here, no more." Vito added, his voice now equally chilly. "There wasn't nobody around who could hear him."

There was a long, meaningful silence before anyone spoke again. Meagan stared in open-mouthed shock at the implacable cruelty of the rodents at her feet. 

"Meagan," the oak at last said, hollowly. "I think you'd better go home, now."
