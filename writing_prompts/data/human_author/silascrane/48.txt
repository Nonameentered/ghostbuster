[Link to "Cargo" from October 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/qdhkbr/cw_follow_me_friday_cargo/)

>Aldexeron hung in the void of space like an orb of light. The city-planet was home to thirty-eight trillion inhabitants, all of whom were locked into servitude one way or another. The economy was held up by off-world trade and it functioned as a hub for ship traffic. Garontis, nicknamed "Gary" by his human friends, was a dock worker. Loading and unloading cargo with a small team of twelve million workers."Gary!" Tywen called out, "only one more ship left. Wanna head to Foxy's Pub after this?"Garontis nodded. Surviving as a Bythantoron on a planet filled with humanoid creatures was something he was proud of, but he didn't consider any of them friends.While Garontis filled out the documentation for the last shipment, Tywen walked into the cargo bay of the next transport ship to visit their dock. He stepped inside and shouted."Gaaaarrryyy! You have to come see this!"

Garontis sighed through his abdominal spicules. He could never make humanoids understand the focus and concentration required to direct a hive of millions of sub-sentient workers with a combination of subtle pheromones and electrical signals.

He tapped in a few final notes on the datapad he clutched delicately in his forelimbs,  unwound his long, segmented body from the cargo crane where he'd been observing and directing his worker-horde, and skittered down to the dock on his many legs.

When he joined Tywen in the new ship's cargo bay, he expected to be shown some shiny gewgaw the humanoid found unaccountably interesting. What he found instead made his ichor run cold.

"It's one of your people, right?" Tywen said, gesturing to the motionless thing sealed inside a transparent plasteel crate. "Or it was. It's dead, right? Like a Bythantoron mummy, or something?"

Garontis supposed Tywen would not understand the significance of its gray-black chitin, its lifeless dun-colored compound eyes, or the long, jagged serrations on its mandibles and antennae. This was no Bythantoron, though it had the general morphology of one. If the stories Garontis' father had told him were true, it was also not dead. Such things as this, the legends claimed, *could not* die.

"It is..." Garontis sputtered out a stream of hisses and clicks from between his mandibles that the human could not understand.  Tywen furrowed his brow in confusion for a moment, as his translator implant failed to render the unusual Bythantoron word in his own language, initially. Not surprising, as it was an obscure term from Garontis' species' mythology.

A moment later, after his implant had time to remotely query an Aldexeronian linguistic database, Tywen's eyes widened in surprise, as Garontis' words were finally translated for him:

"It is *the devil!"*
