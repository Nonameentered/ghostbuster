You're not supposed to feed wildlife. I knew that, even before I moved to country, in the hopes that escaping the busy environs of the city for someplace quiet would help me finally banish my chronic writer's block. 

But, in my defense, at first I thought it was a cat that I heard mewling plaintively outside the little house I'd rented. I couldn't seem to find it when I looked, even though I took a can of tuna with me to look. It stopped making noise as soon as I started poking around the tall grass in the house's overgrown backyard to try and locate it. 

After a few minutes spent literally in the weeds looking for this suddenly silent kitty, I gave up and left the opened can of tuna out on my back porch. I just figured it must be a feral, too shy to approach me even though it was hungry and I had food. 

The next day, I stepped outside to find a tiny fox sitting on the porch next to the empty tuna can. It had light gold fur, oversized ears, an outrageously fluffy tail, and it was staring up at with big, unbelievably expressive blue eyes. 

"Aw," I said, softly. "Hey little guy. Where'd you come from?"

It made a shrill little yip, as though replying to my question, and then it shivered.

My heart had already fully melted into a puddle, by this time, so that helpless shiver sent every latent paternal instinct I possessed into overdrive. My regular human brain told me you should never handle a wild animal, especially not a baby animal, but my primal monkey brain told me that this tiny fox was my precious boy, and I must protect him at all costs. 

The little fox didn't recoil when I cautiously reached out to it, and didn't resist as I gently scooped it up in my arms and carried it inside. 

I set it down on the kitchen counter, where it stood watching me, curiously. I got another can of tuna out of the cupboard, and as I started to open it, it let out another little yip, and started wagging its tail, excitedly.

That was when I noticed that what I had first taken to be an unusually thick and fluffy tail was actually *multiple tails.* They waved and wagged independently, so it was hard to count them, but eventually I realized there were *nine.* 

"Whoa..." I said, squinting incredulously at my new friend. "What kind of fox are you, little guy?"

It blinked at me, and then promptly flopped onto the counter and rolled over, exposing its belly. I hardly had time to consider how adorable that was before I noticed two things: first, he was indeed a little "guy", as opposed to a little "gal". Second, a small square patch of fur on his belly appeared to have been recently shorn away. 

On the fox's bare pink skin, there was a tiny but intricate tattoo. It was recently applied, judging by how the crisp symbols inked in black were still edged with angry red inflammation. Looking closely, I could see that the tattoo was mostly made up of a string of numbers and Japanese characters, along with some kind of barcode. The only part of it written in English was some miniscule lettering printed beneath a logo of a DNA helix with stylized rays of light stretching out from it, that read *"Fujiyama Biotechnology"*
