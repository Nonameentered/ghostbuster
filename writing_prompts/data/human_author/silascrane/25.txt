An hour later, Gwendolyn's coach deposited the inquisitive pair outside the grand entry to Waringham House, one of the oldest and largest estates clustered around the outskirts of the city. Collins, the somber, aged coachman employed by Gwendolyn's family, dutifully helped her and Emily down from the coach, and they strolled purposefully up the marble steps.

Gwendolyn paused at the closed double doors, frowning.

"What's the matter, dear?" Emily asked.

"Well...I mean to say, one is normally simply *shown in."* Gwendolyn said, gesturing to the doors.

"Ah, but one is normally *expected.*" the other woman riposted, raising a finger in the air.

"A status one *acquires* by sending word ahead of time," Gwendolyn shot back, testily. "But we are here precisely because we were unable to do so."

"True, true..." Emily agreed, trailing off.

Gwendolyn nodded, tapping her lace fan against her gloved palm, thoughtfully. After a moment, she turned round.

"Collins?" she called to the coachman.

"Yes, Madam?" the coachman replied, looking up from the horse he'd been tending.

Gwendolyn gestured to the door. "We are at something of an impasse, in terms of protocol. I should like your professional opinion on the matter."

"Of course, madam." the coachman said, amiably. "Under the circumstances, I should think it would be entirely appropriate to make use of the door knocker."

"Ah!" Gwendolyn said. "Very good, that will be all for now, Collins."

"Madam." the coachman said, with a respectful nod.

Gwendolyn rapped sharply on the door three times with the knocker, and the pair waited expectantly.

To their surprise, it was not the butler, nor any other servant that answered a few moments later, but *Olivia.* She was dressed in a rumpled nightgown, and her long golden locks floated unkempt about her head, as though she'd just awakened. When she saw them, her face fell.

"Oh...uh...hello." Olivia said, awkwardly.
