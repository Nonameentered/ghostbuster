"No." the old wizard said.

Serinya blinked. "What?"

"You asked if I could make your enchanted armor physically cover more of your body. And I said no. I literally can't -- the spell would fail."

"I know for a fact you made Sir Ian a suit of full plate enchanted to almost the same specifications!" Serinya snapped.

"Almost," the wizard repeated. "But not quite. There is an important difference, Dame Serinya."

"And what is that?" she hissed.

"That armor was made for him," the wizard said. He then gestured to the pair of slender strips of metal scales, that would barely cover as much as Serinya's undergarments. "Whereas this armor was made for *you."*

"That's not an explanation!" she hissed.

"Of course it is -- it's just not a very detailed one."

"Then give me the details!" Serinya demanded.

The wizard sighed, removing his spectacles and polishing them for a moment. "Very well," he said at last.
The old man turned to a shelf behind him, and withdrew a tall, slender bottle.

"This is a classic Potion of Night Vision. To make it, I had to make a broth from powdered eyebright leaf and stewed owl's eyes during the midnight hour upon the night of the last new moon." the mage explained. 

"And?" 

*"And* why do you suppose that is, Dame Knight?" He pressed. "Why couldn't I have made it from dried bat ears and turnip leaves at noon last Tuesday?"

She frowned, thoughtfully. "I...suppose because owls can see in the dark, and it's supposed to be used on dark nights, of which the new moon is the darkest?"

He nodded. "Correct! It concerns the alignment of natural mystical principles to the purpose of the spell or enchantment. Now," he gestured to the armor. "What is *this* supposed to do?"

"Keep me alive, obviously." she said, crossing her arms. "Though I fail to see *how."*

"Do you not see? It is fitted *to* and magically resonates *with* the parts of you that, by nature, create and sustain life -- those bodily features which blossomed as you entered adulthood and gained the ability to *create* life."

"Then why isn't Sir Ian's armor just a steel codpiece?" Serinya demanded. 

"Because the bodily attributes that appear when a boy becomes a man, and that make him appealing for the purposes of...ah...*creating* life, are more widely distributed: his broad shoulders, his muscles, and so forth.The life protecting magic of enchanted armor made for a man requires a shape that accentuates, or even exaggerates, the physical masculine principle involved in the creation of life. The same is true of armor enchanted for a woman -- it's just that, by the nature of biology, those mystical principles are very different."

"I can't wear this!" Serinya insisted, jingling the skimpy bands of rings in his face. "It barely covers anything!"

"Don't be silly -- the protective magic of the armor extends to your entire body, regardless of what's physically covered by the metal. For all practical purposes, it's exactly as protective as Sir Ian's armor."

"I *mean,"* she growled, "I can't go into battle with half my bits hanging out!"

The wizard paused, then looked from Serinya to the armor.

"Oh!" he exclaimed. "Well, you would wear a shirt and trousers under it, obviously, would you not?"

Serinya blinked. "...you can do that?"

"Of course!" he cried. "Don't you wear clothes under your normal armor?"

"Of course, but I...well, I thought it had to touch my skin." she said, awkwardly, then frowned. "I could have sworn someone told me that."

"Well, that's nonsense." The wizard dismissed, waving his hand. "I mean, there's an anti-chafing and temperature control charm built in, so I suppose you *could* wear it on your skin, but you certainly don't have to."

Serinya brightened. "Oh. But the shape is still kind of...hey, why couldn't I wear a tabard over it?"

The wizard shrugged. "Wear what you like over it -- it's the shape that matters, it's not like that shape has to be *seen."*

After a moment, Dame Serinya nodded. "Very well, good wizard. It's still somewhat unsettling, but a knight must face all challenges bravely, including facts of life. I withdraw my complaint."

Serinya bade the wizard a polite farewell and left his shop with her new armor. A moment later, the wizard's apprentice entered the front of the shop with a broom on his shoulder, fresh from sweeping out the storeroom.

"All done, master." he announced.

"Ah, good." The wizard said, absently, then chuckled. "Do you know, there was a lovely young woman here to complain about an order of enchanted armor just now."

"Oh? Why's that?" the young man asked, curiously.

"Ha, that's the funny bit! She was laboring under the misapprehension that the enchantment on the armor wouldn't work unless she *didn't wear anything else!* As if a bit of common fabric could block wizardry! Honestly, who spreads such nonsense about magic among the mundane folk?" 

The apprentice cleared his throat. "Er...I can't imagine, master."
