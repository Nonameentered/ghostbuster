David didn't have any friends. Perhaps it was because his parents were overprotective, and cautious about where they let David go. Or, perhaps it was because he lived in a house in the country, on the edge of the marshy wetlands, where other houses were few and far between. So far from town, there were hardly any other children around at all.

David often feared that it was none of those things. Instead, he worried that it was because he was *strange.* Everyone was a little different, his parents had told him, but David knew he was *more* different. Sometimes he thought that he was so different, that it must surely be *wrong,* to be like him.

Michael, on the other hand, was one of the *cool* kids at David's school. He was smart, and strong, and funny -- everything that David wasn't. He was exactly the sort of boy David wanted to be his friend. 

But on the day that Michael cornered him outside the boys bathroom, David realized that that would never happen.

"I know what you are." Michael said, as David stepped out of the restroom, and the taller boy moved to block his path. "No one else believes me, but I *know."*

David's heart twisted. "I...I don't know what you mean."

"I saw what you did to Mrs. Benton!" Michael snapped. "You're...you're some kind of wizard! You turned her into a *frog,* in front of the whole class! Everyone acts like it didn't happen, but I *saw it!* Whatever you did to everyone else to make them forget, or...or see something different, it didn't work on me!" 

"You don't understand!" David pleaded. "It...it wasn't like that, I wasn't trying to do that!"

"Then change her back!" Michael demanded. 

David's shoulders slumped. "I can't."

"Why not?" Michael snarled.

"I already tried." David answered, miserably. He was starting to shake.It was already so hard to focus. "I...I don't know how to re-do a spell once it's breaks."

"So figure it out! I've seen that weird book you read in the library, sometimes -- that's like your spell book, right? The answer's probably in there." 

"P-probably," David admitted, weakly. His head was starting to ache fiercely. "But I...I can't study it. I'm already concentrating on...on a lot of other magic."

"Forget your other magic!" Michael snarled, angrily, shoving David against the wall. David didn't blame him. This *was* his fault. Michael was just standing up for Mrs. Benton. His headache intensified, and tears started running down his cheeks.

Michael's expression softened when David started to cry, and he looked away, guiltily. "Look...I, I'm sorry about that. I shouldn't have shoved you. But you did this. That means it's your *responsibility* to fix it."

David smiled weakly, his lower lip trembling. Michael *would* say something like that. It was why David admired him so much. He groaned, as another wave of pain stabbed through his head like a spike, and power flowed out from him. Nearby, the water fountain in front of the boys' bathroom warped and collapsed in on itself. In its place, the rotted remains of an old tree appeared, a pool of stagnant water collected in a hollowed out bowl atop the collapsing stump.

"David!" Michael cried. "What's happening? What are you doing?"

"I'm sorry!" David wailed. "I can't hold it back anymore!" 

The school began to shake, and all around the boys, it started to change. The ground turned to sodden moss and mud, the walls into gnarled trees, and stagnant, reeking water began to flood the hall, rising up to their ankles.

"David!" Michael said, reaching out and seizing the other boy's hand in a firm grip. "You have to stop this! Whatever this magic is, you have to *control* it! Hang on!"

David looked into Michael's clear blue eyes. He saw his honesty, and his simple, steadfast determination. It gave him hope. Michael smiled at him, and nodded firmly.

"You can do this." Michael said.

Gritting his teeth, David fought to control the magical storm that was melting the school around him, as teachers and students alike rushed out into the hall to escape their unraveling classrooms. The water receded slightly, and one of the rows of mossy trees started to turn back into the wall of the corridor, lined with classroom doors.

"Hold on!" Michael encouraged. "It's working."

David bore down with all his might, spending every ounce of his will to reverse the course of the magic. 

And then, a spike of mind-destroying agony hit him like a runaway train, and he blacked out.

\----

David awoke with a start, coughing up swamp water. He looked around, frantically, but so only the dreary expanse of the swamp. The school was gone. So were the students and teachers. He sighed heavily, weighed down by heartbreak and disappointment. 

As had happened with Mrs. Benton, he'd lost control of the magic from the ancient spell book handed down in his family for generations...of the nigh-deific transmutation spell that had turned a simple frog into his cheerful homeroom teacher, a cheerful woman who was always ready to greet her students with a warm smile. 

He'd just wanted so *badly* to be a normal kid. He wanted to go to school, to have friends, and teachers. He'd wanted it bad enough, that he'd tried to use his magic to make it happen. He'd thought he'd actually done it. The swamp had become a school, *his* school, full of teachers eager to instruct, and students eager to learn, the buildings created by magic from the trunks of rotten trees, and the people from the frogs that lived in the marsh. 

But the complex working had taxed him, and it gradually wore him down. After a few wonderful days of slipping away from home after his daily chores and studies were done, and entering the fantastically normal little microcosm he'd created, it had started to slip away from him. And now, it was all gone. Worse, he didn't think he could get it back -- at least not with the level of knowledge he currently possessed. It seemed so much harder to re-cast a spell on something that had already been ensorcelled before. 

So, just like that, David was once again an isolated, homeschooled loner, he thought, bitterly, as he drug himself to his feet, and started trudging towards home, wet and miserable. Wet, miserable, and *alone.*

After he had taken a few paces, however, he flinched, and froze, as he felt something drop onto his shoulder from a nearby tree. Cautiously, he turned his head to look at it.

On his shoulder, there sat a young bullfrog. 

A bullfrog with clear blue eyes.

He smiled at the frog. Somehow, the frog seemed to smile back.

David resumed his sodden march back home, and the frog rode contentedly on his shoulder, as though it had always lived there. Though he was still soaked to the bone, he did not feel as miserable as before.

And he no longer felt quite so alone.
