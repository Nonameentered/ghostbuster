"Aliens, by and large," Dr. Keene announced to his students, crisply, "Are disgusting."

Several of the students in his Xenodiplomacy class looked at each other uncertainly, some murmuring softly. It seemed like an odd way to open a class that was, ostensibly, designed to instruct humanity's new generation of diplomats in how to interact with alien cultures. 

But, Dr. Keene was a first-generation explorer -- he and the rest of humanity's first wave of explorers had been *out there,* in interstellar space. There was a lot about aliens that was still classified, to the general public. 

"There are a few soft-brained types who wanted us to sugar coat that for you." Dr. Keene continued, once he was sure he had the class' full attention. "Or give you a bunch of simpering, mealy-mouthed dissembling about respecting extraterrestrial cultures and not imposing our human standards on them. That's bullshit. Aliens. Are. *Gross.* You need to accept and understand that now, or you won't make it out there, among them."

A student raised her hand. "Sir, I don't think that's fair! They're strange to us, yes, and more different that we might have imagined, but I'm sure we're strange to them, too. And some of them are, in my opinion, quite beautiful, even by human standards! What about the Ceanolytes?"

Dr. Keene lifted his eyes to the ceiling, and sighed. "Ah! Of course. The Ceanolytes. Aesthetic saving graces of the galactic community. Okay, I'll tell you what. Let's watch that first contact video I'm sure you've all seen."

The doctor tapped on his lectern's tactile display, and footage of a Ceanolyte appeared on the large viewscreen behind him. It showed the translucent, almost humanoid-shaped creature gliding gracefully towards a nervous human contact specialist. It's motions were appropriately otherworldly, and the natural bioluminescent stripes along its body gave it an almost angelic ethereal beauty.

Several of the students sighed at the now-iconic moment when it extended a delicate three-fingered hand, and the human contact specialist touched it with her own fingertips, and smiled warmly up at the Ceanolyte ambassador. 

"This is where the publicly released video ends." Dr. Keene said, casually, as they watched the contact specialist slowly lower her hand from the alien's.

The students murmured excitedly, realizing they were about to get their first peek at previously classified material. They watched as the contact specialist opened her mouth to speak to the alien.

"On behalf of the people of Earth, I--" her voice was cut off in a choking gurgle, as the Ceanolyte opened its own mouth, and vomited directly into hers. 

The students gasped in horror as they saw the contact specialist reel back, gagging, and eventually empty her own stomach contents on the ground, then cried out in disgust as the Ceanolyte stooped to slurp the human's second-hand lunch off ground between them.

"Yeah, first contact. Quite a magical moment, isn't it?" Dr. Keene said drily, as the class did its own less-dramatic retching and reeling. "But that's how Ceanolytes greet each other -- they don't have any facial expressions or body language to speak of, but they *do* accumulate excess endorphins and neurotransmitters in one of their four stomachs, so they communicate their emotional state by *puking in each other's mouths* so the other person can literally taste how they feel. What you just saw, I'm told, was the Ceanolyte's version of a friendly smile -- the specialist said it tasted like a subtle blend of warm cream cheese and pine-scented antiseptic. Oh, and here's more stuff the contact specialist had to go through.*"* 

As the hapless human ambassador in the video tried to regain her footing, the Ceanolyte began spraying her with mucus in a fashion that, to every human in the room, could not help looking unbelievably obscene. Veritable geysers of the foamy spume coated the human as the Ceanolyte drew closer to her.

"What is it doing?" a disgusted student cried, not bothering to raise his hand.

"Talking. Unlike much of the galactic community, Ceanolytes *do* communicate with sound in a manner quite similar to human speech. Unfortunately, just as the vibrations of human speech only sound normal when passing through an Earth-like atmosphere, Ceanolytes are only equipped to produce and perceive intelligible vibrations through the thick mucus they secrete. You should see a conversation between three or more of them -- it gets *wet."* Keene continued. "The Ceanolyte ambassador here understood that we humans aren't nearly as proficient in the mucus-production department, so he tried to pick up the slack by being *extra* gooey."

"How...how can this even be possible?" another student demanded. "Doesn't communicating by...by *fluid exchange,* spread disease?"

Keene nodded. "Sure does. That contact specialist was in quarantine for six months, afterwards. Ceanolyte lifespans, we've determined, are *severely* limited by the pathogens they routinely transmit like this -- but what are they gonna do? Never talk to each other? They, and other species like them, see spreading diseases to each other as a simple fact of life. It's just the biological price for having evolved rich, complex forms of communication, in their view. It doesn't occur to them that they could have their cake, and not puke it into someone's else's mouth, too."

"They *are* disgusting." the student who'd previously protested murmured, her eyes wide.

"Hey! Great, now you're catching up." Dr. Keene said cheerfully. "And none of you actually lost your lunch -- that bodes well for your ability to complete this program. You're going to need that strong stomach, if you plan to communicate with a galaxy chock-full of species whose methods of communication mostly involve *fluids."* 

"We're...we're...going to have to learn to do things like that?" a student cried, pointing at the screen.

Dr. Keene smiled, wanly. "At first, probably. But that's not the ultimate purpose of this class, or the Xenodiplomacy initiative in general."

"What is?" another student asked, hopefully.

Keene continued, "A lot of smart people are working on technological solutions to allow aliens to communicate with us and each other. For example, we're researching devices Ceanolytes could wear on their skin, to translate vibrations in the air into ones they can understand, and micro-fluidic chemical synthesizers to simulate the taste of other beings' emotions. "

"To what end, doctor?" a student inquired.

"Well, widespread adoption of such devices would not only make them a lot easier for us to talk to, it would ultimately improve their lives, as well." Dr. Keene explained. "Hopefully, through diplomacy and aggressive campaigning, humanity can teach the whole galaxy the concept of hygiene."

"What if they don't want to? Isn't all this like...part of their culture?" a student asked.

"Their culture sucks!" the previously skeptical student snapped, still looking a little green. "We need to teach them to stop being *disgusting."*

"That's the spirit!" Dr. Keene said, approvingly.
