Marath stared impassively into the eyes of the palace guard, as the light began to fade from them. Withdrawing his poisoned blade from the man's gut, Marath stepped past him as he collapsed to the ground, motioning to his robed followers to continue alongside him.

"T-the Des...pised..." the guard wheezed, feebly attempting to call out an alarm, before the poison paralyzed his heart and lungs, and he lay still. 

Marath the Despised. Marath the Heretic. Marath the Outcast.

Marath had many such epithets. Some of them were even true. Yes, he was *despised* by the kingdom that had spurned him as ruler. And yes, he was a heretic by some measures, having rejected the so-called god that had, at least in the eyes of the people, rejected him. He was certainly outcast, having been banished from the borders of his homeland by the usurper who'd stolen his throne.

After tonight, none of his names would matter except one: Marath the First, the true king, returned to reclaim his birthright and punish those who had betrayed him.

Marath flung open the doors to the inner courtyard of the palace he had been raised in, heading for the royal quarters beyond, but as he entered the tranquil garden, he froze in surprise. 

There, at the foot of the fountain in the center of the courtyard, knelt his cousin Farrin. The usurper. The false king. The man who'd exiled him.  He was alone and unguarded, dressed only in a night robe, his head bowed. Marath should have known -- that pious fool. He'd always presumed his cousin's religiosity was a mask he used to curry favor with commoners and the clergy, but in a way it was even more distasteful to discover that he simpered before his silent god even in his private moments. Marath saw, to his disgust, that his cousin had even removed the fine golden statuary he'd commissioned at great expense to adorn his garden, and replaced it with a single drab marble Spire of the Divine set atop the fountain. Tasteless.

The sound of Marath and his acolytes' entry alerted Farrin, who raised his head and turned towards them. 

"What is the meaning of this?" the usurper demanded.

Several of the acolytes drew blades and started forward, but Marath raised a hand to halt them.

Marath raised his hood, and Farrin gasped. Good. He *should* be afraid.

"Cousin!" the usurper cried. "By the Divine, what have you done to yourself?"

Marath sneered. He did look different than when the false king had last seen him. His head was shorn now, and his forehead marked with a scar in the shape of his new god's spiralling, many-armed sigil. He was no longer only a king, but high priest to a *true g*od, having risen in his exile to lead the scattered followers of a deity that, like himself, had been rejected by blind, foolish men.

"Your god abandoned me, *cousin."* Marath said, smiling. "And so I have found a stronger one."

"The cult of Kul'Zyr?" Farrin said, horrified, looking from Marath to his followers dressed in the regalia of their sect. "You have sworn to the lord of blood-soaked briars?"

"I have sworn to the *true* god of this land." Marath corrected, enjoying his cousin's discomfort. "To a god that is *real.* Kul'Zyr may demand blood in exchange for his favor, but that is no less than his due. I always demanded tribute from my subjects, as is my right. Why should I, in turn, expect my *god* to ask any less of me? The coin maybe be different, but the principle is the same. A *real* king would understand that."

"A real king does not see his people as coins to be bargained with!" Farrin snarled. "This is monstrous, cousin!"

Marath smirked and started forward. "Monstrous? You cast me out of my own kingdom. You justified your treason as the will of your god, owing to my supposed transgressions against him. I assure you, my god finds you no less repugnant than yours found me."

Farrin drew a dagger from beneath his robes and took a step back, falling into a combat stance, his face hardening, though he eyed Marath's followers warily. "Have you forgotten which of us is the better fighter?"

Marath scowled angrily, remembering his defeat at Farrin's hand in a duel, part of the pretext his cousin had used to seize the throne. It still stung. But then he laughed. He glanced at his  own poisoned blade and then idly cast it aside. "I need no weapon to deal with you, Farrin. Not any longer." 

Then he whispered to that deep, distant presence that had grown in his mind since he joined the Embrace of Kul'Zyr, drawing closer, and becoming less and less alien to him, as he sated it with blood. "Let them see, my lord."

Marath spread his arms, and suddenly thousands of ghostly black tendrils rose up around him, bristling with long, sharp thorns, writhing dangerously. Farrin stumbled back, eyes wide. To his credit, he then steadied himself before the display of Marath's eldritch might. It did not matter. Soon he would kneel.

"Behold the power of a true god!" Marath roared. "What do you say to me now, usurper?"

Farrin drew in a deep breath, and closed his eyes. "You have learned nothing. You think you have grown stronger since I cast you out, but you have only become more delusional than ever. You have, once and for all, proved that I was right to exile you. "

"I am delusional?!" Marath screamed, the multitude of tendrils writhing wildly with his rage, tearing the ground of the courtyard, lashing limbs of the trees. The acolytes behind him stumbled backward too late, and the flailing arms of Kul'Zyr cut them down. Marath didn't care -- he still had other servants, and he would soon have all he could ever want. He didn't need anyone, not anymore. "Even now, you think yourself above me?"

Marath surged forward, arms extended, directing the blood-drinking briars to flay the very soul of the usurper before him. They flowed towards the false king like a river, as Farrin stood his ground before the fountain crowned with the icon of his false god.

Farrin opened his eyes. His expression was strangely calm.

"The words I spoke were not mine. And they were not meant for you, cousin." Farrin said, evenly.

Light exploded from the tip of the spire atop the fountain, blinding Marath for a moment. When his vision cleared, he gaped in disbelief. The translucent tendrils of Kul'Zyr had halted before striking Farrin, now clenched in an immense spectral hand that glowed with pure white light.

Marath opened his mouth to cry out a supplication to his god, but found himself suddenly breathless, as he stared in disbelief at the phantom fist strangling the briars of Kul'zyr as they writhed impotently against it. The spectral limb heaved upward, and the thorny vines tore free of the ground like uprooted weeds. 

The distant presence in Marath's mind screamed...and then was silent.
