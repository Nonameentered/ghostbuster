The lumberjack blinked, looking from the red-hooded girl to the carcass of the wolf, as the young lady continued to panic, with tears running down her cheeks.

"Grandma!" the girl in the red cloak cried, horrified, as she regarded the corpse of the bloated wolf on the ground, dead by a skull-splitting blow from the lumberjack's trusty woodaxe.

"Kid, that's...that's a *wolf."* the lumberjack said, hesitantly. He didn't want to sound patronizing, but it *really* seemed like she didn't get that.

"It's my grandma, you monster!" the girl insisted. "That's her dress and bonnet and everything!"

"Pmphagnasha!" said the wolf. The lumberjacked jumped back in surprise, hefting his axe. Then he realized the sound wasn't coming from the wolf's mouth, which still hung mutely agape. It was coming from the wolf's stomach.

"Grandma?" the girl cried, glancing around wildly. "A-are you a ghost?"

Rushing forward, the lumberjack drew his belt knife. Over the red-hooded young woman's protests, he carefully slit the wolf's distended belly open. An older woman tumbled out of the wolf's abdomen, covered in bile.

"Grandma!" the younger woman cried.

"Prosopagnosia!" cried the old woman, no longer muffled by being inside the wolf's stomach, as she wiped bile from her face.

"What?" the lumberjack asked, looking between them. He pointed to the red-cloaked girl. "Is that her name, or something?"

The old woman shook her head, standing up and stretching. She wore a bonnet and dress nearly identical to that which had "disguised" the wolf. "Nope -- that's her *disorder,* it's what I was trying to tell you. *Little Red,* there had a rare disease where she can't tell faces apart -- she identifies people by the clothes they wear and other context clues, and that wolf was pretty good at mimicking my voice."

"Yeah," Red agreed, with a nod. "Sorry about the mixup."

"Oh..." the lumberjack said, looking between the two women, still a little confused.

"And thanks for taking care of that *pervert* there, by the way." the old woman said, gesturing to the wolf.

The lumberjacked blinked. "Pervert? I mean, not to *defend* him or anything, but I'm pretty sure he just ate you because he's a predator. A, uh, a regular one, I mean, not the *other* kind. That's just what predators do."

She snorted. "Oh that part was fine -- I was *fully* on board with the consensual vore-play, that's why I put that personal ad in the paper, in the first place. But when my *granddaughter* showed up for a visit unexpectedly and he tried to involve *her?* Sure, she's over 18 and everything, but we're *blood relatives!"*

"Gross!" Red agreed, wrinkling her nose.

"Consensual...vore...what?" The lumberjack exclaimed, his face contorting.

"Consensual vore play. You know, when you get your jollies by swallowing someone whole  and / or being swallowed whole by someone? You spit them back out before they *really* suffocate or get digested, of course." Red's grandmother explained. Pausing, she looked the lumberjack up and down, and then bit her lower lip.

"Mmmm, speaking of vore play, is it true that you lumberjacks have big...appetites?" she asked with a sly grin, her voice turning husky.

"Grandma!" Red cried, scowling. "I'm *still* standing right here!"

"Right, I'm *out,"* the lumberjack declared, firmly, turning on his heel and marching out the door. *"And* I'm moving -- *screw* Portland!"
