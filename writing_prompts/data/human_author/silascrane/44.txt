You charge towards towards the building. Your clothes were mostly either shredded or kicked free as you writhed through your bestial transformation, but you still feel the familiar weight of your office ID badge, dangling from its lanyard around your neck, as always. 

You slam into the after-hours entrance behind the office building where you work, claws scrabbling awkwardly at the steel door and concrete wall, as you rear up on your hind legs. Fighting to maintain your sentience and suppress the animal urge to hunt, you unsteadily maneuver the dangling badge in front of the sensor by the door. 

The door beeps softly as the lock and latch disengage long enough for you to push the door open and scramble inside. You feel your human consciousness fading fast, but you let it go with a sense of relief and accomplishment as the door closes behind you, and locks automatically a second later. Trapped here, in the sterile environs of your office, with all your coworkers having gone home hours ago, you can surely do no harm -- nor betray your new "plant-based" diet.

Some time later, you awaken beneath your desk, naked, shivering, and human. You're grateful for the cold, as you know it means no one else has arrived to turn on the heat. You also remember the gym clothes you forgot to take home Friday, still in your desk drawer, and thank your lucky stars that you're a procrastinator.

You are already planning how you will search out the site of the your transformation, and hopefully find your discarded phone and keys in time to return to work, when you finally realize you woke up holding something in your hand. 

Your eyes widen in horror, as you recognize the torn collar of Mr. Whiskerby, the  office cat.
