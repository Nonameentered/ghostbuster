"Now this is an example of a minor animal deity worshipped by multiple cultures in the Pre-Alignment Era." Professor Heathcliff said, as the class approached the virtual display case. Inside, several holograms depicting a very round, stylized cat rotated on their axes. The nameplate on the display read *Garfield.*

One of his students, a bookish young man named Arten, peered curiously at the virtual artifacts. "Weird. It's like they heard about a tiger, but didn't know what one looked like. Didn't they have paleontologists?"

"It's hard to say." Heathcliff admitted. "Much of whatever knowledge humanity had before the Alignment was lost in the catastrophes at the end of that era. However, we believe tigers were actually still extant when Garfield, here, was worshipped by the populace. The inaccuracies are probably the result of a deliberate stylization, not ignorance or lack of technical skill on the part of the artist."

Arten nodded, slowly.

Elma, another student, raised her hand. "What was it supposed to the god of?"

"Well, again, the information is fragmented, but there are clues. Garfield was likely a tutelary deity, a minor but very popular domestic god. There were a few such figures in their mythology, possibly all aspects of the same ubiquitous deity -- my own surname is derived from a lesser known aspect of Garfield, in fact." He gestured to one of the idols in the case. "See the large round eyes? Many experts believe those are meant to indicate his watchfulness over the homes of his devotees." Professor Heathcliff said. He then made a gesture, causing one of the virtual artifacts to increase in size and move to the forefront of the display. "This is a particular interesting example of a Garfield idol. There were flexible polymer cups on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, which were likely used to attach it to a flat, non-porous surface."

Elma frowned. "Like...the inside of a door, or something?"

The Professor raised a finger. "No no -- remember when we discussed the excavation of the old capital city of Epcot? Primitive as our ancestors were, in many ways, they did have *glass windows,* Pre-Alignment." The students murmured in understand. 

The Professor adopted a pose similar to the effigy, arms spread and hands splayed out. "Imagine *that* staring out at you when you came home!"

A ripple of laughter ran through the class. It was broken when a voice snapped. 

"That's not true!" one of the students hissed.

Heathcliff sighed, heavily. Irmia, a sharp-faced girl whose features grew even sharper when she was angry, shouldered her way to the front. "Garfield wasn't some minor house spirit! And Garfield was *certainly* not male! *She* was the Mother Goddess, worshipped by all!" 

Professor Heathcliff rolled his eyes. "Irmia--"

But the student went on, pointing to the round belly of the idol. "Isn't it obvious? The Goddess is always depicted with a gravid womb!" 

"Most experts agree that the Garfield effigies depict *obesity,* not pregnancy. It was probably a sign of wealth and plenty." Professor Heathcliff corrected, patiently.

"Before the harsh, paternal monotheistic religions brutally suppressed her worship, people lived in peace and harmony following the example of Mother Garfield. Our tradition goes back thousands of years to--"

"Enough!" The Professor snapped, finally silencing her, though she continued glowering. "We are not here to discuss comparative religion, Irmia. This is a *history* class!*"*

"And history says *Lasagnianism* isn't thousands of years old -- it was founded 70 years ago by a bunch of burnt-out college dropouts looking for an excuse to have pasta-fueled orgies." Arten quipped.

Irmia looked ready to lunge at the boy, but Heathcliff stepped between them quickly. "I said enough, both of you! We're moving on." Once Professor Heathcliff was certain he'd cowed his quarelling pupils, he turned on his heel, and walked briskly away from the Garfield exhibit, his students following after.

"Let's move on, from ancient religion to ancient numismatics." the Professor said, crisply, as he led them into the next room of the museum. "Now, we know from recent excavations that the coin of the ancients appears to have been a sort of scrip, made from compressed plant fibers. As you can see, these were labelled with their numerical value, as well as a depiction of a particular mythological creature, which experts believe were collectively known as *Pokemon..."*
