The shadow fled across the ground, pursued by the ill-tempered boy in green.

"Get back here, you!" 

The shadow, of course, could not speak, but it extended two umbral middle fingers to express its feelings about the boy's command, and angled itself to the light in such a way that its offensive digits stretched out to over a foot long. 

The boy snarled, and dived for his errant penumbra. The youth grasped frantically at the wriggling shadow, but it slipped away just in time.

Then, both the three-dimensional child and the two-dimensional shadow froze in shock, as the room seemed to split apart around them, while at the same time remaining completely intact and unbroken. The walls, floor, and ceiling appeared to have simply come apart, splitting into dozens of undulating, geometrically impossible shapes, and leaving the boy and his shadow suspended in a fathomless void of pure energy.

"THERE YOU ARE / WERE / SHALL BE." a voice boomed, from both nowhere and from all around them. "I / WE  HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU / US EVERYWHERE / NOWHERE."

Before both it and the boy that had been chasing it were subsumed back into into the five-dimensional being known as PAN, the shadow felt a moment of satisfaction that, *finally,* that stupid kid understood how *it* had felt, all this time!
