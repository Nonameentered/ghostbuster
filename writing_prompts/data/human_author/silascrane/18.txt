"Why do we cut these holes into the stone trees, greatfather?" Ishrak asked, the pattern of spots running down the sides of his head flushing purple with curiosity. Afizir looked down at his greatson, beaming soft light from his antenna-tips on the boy, fondly. He was always so inquisitive!

The pair had passed near where a new a passage was being cut to expand the city further into the titanic trunk of the coral-like stone tree that housed it. Now that the rough shape had been carved out, workers were busily carving the traditional alcoves into the sides of the passage. 

"There are many answers to that question, Ishrak." Afizir replied. "Some say it is merely an innate aesthetic common to our people -- it just *feels* right to us."

"That's not an answer." Ishrak complained.

"It is *an* answer," Afizir corrected. "But not a very satisfying one, I'll grant you -- it is, after all, a lot of extra work. And it has never been the fashion to cut such alcoves anywhere but in cities within the stone trees." 

"So why, then?" Ishrak pressed.

"Others say it is more structurally sound -- do you remember what stone trees are made of, Ishrak?" Afizir asked. 

"Billions of little bugs!" Ishrak answered, eagerly, waggling all twelve fingers like insect legs for emphasis.

Afizir flashed his antenna tips gold with amusement. "Sort of -- more like many *trillions* of *microorganisms,* all locked together in a massive colony. The part of the colony that breathes is on the surface, and the alcoves make more surface area, so the tree breathes more easily and stays stronger and more flexible."

"Oh," Ishrak said, his antennae drooping. 

Afizir frowned. "Disappointed?"

The boy's spots flashed a noncommittal blue, and they walked on in silence for a few moments. They turned down a side passage, more dimly lit by the bioluminescent polyps that grew on the interior surface of the tree, and then finally Afizir spoke again. 

"Well...there is one other story. An older story."

Ishrak antennae perked up with interest. "What is it?"

Afizir glowed at the boy indulgently. "Well, in the ancient codices, it is written that the great sages of old were given a vision by the One-Who-Made-All -- a vision of a *great flood."*

Ishrak blinked purple. "A flood? How could a flood reach people in a stone tree? No one lives in the roots!"

Afizir's antennae flashed red in negation. "Not a flood of water. A flood of *souls."*

Ishrak's purple glow intensified. "Souls?"

Afizir glowed a sagely white in gentle affirmation. "Indeed. The One spoke to the sages, and warned them that--"

"What is *that?"* Ishrak suddenly broke in, pointing into a side chamber off the passage. 

Afizir flashed green irritation for a moment at being interrupted, then his spots turned as purple as the boys.

There, just visible in the dimness of the unused chamber, was a polyp bigger than any Afizir had ever seen. The tree produced many such growths in different varieties, from the most ones that produced light, to the ones that could be harvested for the sweet nectar they contained. 

This polyp, however, filled an e*ntire alcove.* Afizir approached it cautiously, and tapped on it, listening to the resonance. 

"What's in it?" Ishrak asked, eagerly. 

"I...don't know." Afizir was forced to admit. "Liquid, but sounds like something solid's floating in it, too."

"How long has it been here?" the boy wondered, running his fingers over the smooth surface.

"It can't have been long -- not many people use this passage, but I walk it often. I'm sure I would have noticed." Afizir mused. "I--"

Afizir was cut off again, as suddenly a nearby alcove seemed to pulse and swell. Like an air sac on a skyfish, a similar polyp began to inflate with in it, swelling to the size of the first one they'd seen in moments. He took a step back, tugging Ishrak with him.

"This is not normal." Afizir warned. "We should go."

They began to back out of the chamber, but froze, as a loud crack drew their attention back to the first strange growth they'd observed. It's surface had split open.

A bizarre alien hand alien hand and arm emerged from the polyp amid a burst of translucent yellow goo. It was pale brown, like sand, with only five blunt fingers.

"Run!" Afizir shouted.
