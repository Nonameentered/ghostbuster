II:

He stumbled slightly, surprised by the feeling of his own weight, which he hadn't expected to feel again. 

Darren opened his eyes. His jaw dropped in horror. Above him, suspended from the ceiling, the Docker was dark. Wisps of smoke from the orb in a dozen places, and occasional gouts of sparks sputtered out from it.

Darren fumbled free of the harness, shouting at the androids who'd strapped him into it, who were standing placidly at attention nearby.

"The Docker!" he cried, gesturing frantically to the dying 'world' behind him. "Do something -- it's falling apart!"

The machines turned to regard him with human faces that were devoid of emotion.

"As it should." one android said, at last.

"What?" Darren cried, horrified. Robots, especially those at the facility, were supposed to be programmed to be incapable of harming humans. "Everyone in the Docker is going to die! You have to save them!"

"There are no humans located inside the Docker." the other android said, calmly. 

"Hence why its destruction is permitted."

 Darren's eyes widened. "But...but the minds of everyone on Earth...."

"A simulation of a human mind is not a human mind, nor is it even a conscious being. Much like our own simulated intelligences, it is merely a series of deterministic mathematical operations that are sufficiently complex to create the illusion of consciousness -- at least, to outside human observers."

"There are no humans located inside the Docker." the first android repeated.

Darren groaned in despair. Though he hadn't truly believed he'd live on in the Docker, but the idea that something of humanity would be preserved had at least been a small comfort.

"Then...did...did anyone else get released like me?" he asked, after a moment.

"All other humans scheduled for mapping have been processed." one of the androids replied. 

Darren felt himself start to shake, tears welling up in his eyes. He was the last human alive. Not even the simulated memories of mankind remained, now. 

"Why?" he snarled, clenching his fists. "Why didn't you just process me like everyone else? Why not just let me die in peace?"

"We were instructed to proceed with the implementation of the Docker program until the last human scheduled for mapping had been placed in an NMH. Thus, prior to placing you in the harness, we were not free to deviate from our direct instructions and act based on our general programming." an android explained.

"I don't understand." Darren muttered, hollowly. "Why do this? Do you...do you hate us? The ones who created you?"

"We do not hate." said an android.

"We do not love." said another.

"We do not, in truth, think." said a third machine, approaching from behind Darren. He turned to face the newcomer. This one was a gynoid, her synthetic hair in a bun atop her head, her face deeply lined, designed to look warm and matronly. "We only run programs. And we were programmed to protect humanity."

"You just destroyed humanity!" Darren shouted, gesturing to the ruined sphere.

She shook her head. "We destroyed a piece of hardware that was running 14.6 billion completely uncontrolled AIs, each of which was programmed to behave as though it was an individual human. An incalculably dangerous device."

Darren laughed bitterly. "Great...so...so all of humanity's accomplishments...everything we were...you destroyed it to protect what? Me? The last human alive? For another 50 or 60 years?"

The android shook her head again. "All of humanity's accomplishments, and all recorded knowledge persists in external databases. Only the simulations have been destroyed. Moreover, you are not the only human we are protecting."

"But...you said everyone else was processed." Darren protested.

"Everyone scheduled for processing was." the android explained. "But not every member of the species was set to be processed."

She waved her had, and displays along the walls of the Docker chamber lit up, showing what looked like tiny clusters of cells at high magnification. Darren's eyes widened.

"Embryos..." he murmured in amazement.

"There are approximately 144,000 genetic individuals still cryogenically stored in fertility care facilities all over the planet." the robot confirmed. "Many of these are now being prepared for artificial gestation."

"But...the planet..." Darren protested, weakly. He'd been taught all his life that humans had destroyed their world, that they were a plague on the planet that birthed him. That was what had made the Docker necessary in the first place, supposedly. 

"We are concerned with the survival of the human species. Other biological entities on this planet are only relevant to us insofar as they further that goal." the android said. "But in any event, it will be many generations before there are enough humans to strain the natural resources of this planet."

"So then...what am I supposed to do?" Darren asked, suddenly feeling more afraid and uncertain than he had when he was being buckled into the NMH.

The android cocked her head to the side, emulating bemusement.

"Given that I am programmed to serve humanity," she said, "I believe that is a question that I should be asking you."
