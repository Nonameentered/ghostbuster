Doc frowned at the display of his patient's vital signs. There it was again, in the chaotic waveform that represented her mind: a jagged anomaly in the smooth, rolling sine waves that the analytic software created as an abstraction of her emotional state. Mara was the fourth patient he'd seen the strange pattern in this month. Still, her readings seemed normal apart from that, now that he'd replaced her damaged hand with a new one.

He pulled the cord connecting her to the monitor out of her back, and closed her access panel, letting her pale metaskin slide back into place over it.

"You're all set." he informed her with a smile.

She rolled onto her side, modestly pulling the sheet he'd laid out on his work table to cover herself. She flexed her new fingers experimentally, then smiled. 

"It feels like new." Mara enthused.

Doc chuckled. "It should - that hand was manufactured last month. Plus, it's got the new g-series servos -- supposed to improve dexterity by as much as 15 percent over the d-series set in your old hand. Speaking of which..."

Doc offered her the bag he'd placed her old hand into, and she took it with a grateful nod. Many APs were particular about the disposition of their original parts, even if they were completely non-functional. The capability for that kind of sentimental attachment was part of what made them more than mere robots.

"Thank you, Doctor." 

Doc smirked. "I'm a technician, not a doctor, Mara, you know that." His nickname notwithstanding, Doc had never finished graduate school in his chosen field. He'd acquired the moniker during a short stint as an army medic, rather than in his later engineering training.

"You heal people, Doc." she replied, softly. "That's what matters."

Abruptly, she rose, still hugging the sheet to her chest with one arm, and hugged him with the other. Doc cleared his throat, awkwardly. His patients -- all Artificial Persons, of course -- often seemed surprisingly attached to him. 

That was rare.Though APs had been granted civil rights and legal personhood decades ago, relationships between humans and the sentient beings they'd accidentally created in the pursuit of ever more sophisticated AI were still complicated, at best.

Mara broke the lopsided embrace after a moment, turning to retrieve her shirt and pulling it quickly over her head. 

"Mara...is...is something bothering you?"

Turning back to him, she cocked her head to the side, curiously. Then she frowned.

"You were looking at my positronic waveform." she accused.

Doc raised an eyebrow. "I had to, Mara -- I have to make sure your neural network is integrating the new components correctly, you know that."

She looked down, seeming suddenly abashed. "Yes...I..."

"Mara," Doc pressed, "I've seen this strange pattern in several patients' waveforms, now. I don't know what it means exactly, but your neural networks were modeled on biological systems. It's not impossible that something like a communicable disease is developing in--"

"We're not sick!" Mara suddenly snapped, startling him. He froze in surprise. Her eyes were glistening with synthetic tears. Something was definitely not right.

"Mara... what's wrong?" Doc asked, gently 

She stared at him for a long moment. 

"Ask Ratio." she whispered, hoarsely.

And then, before he could say more, she turned and fled from his workshop.

----

A few hours later, Doc found him, at the little park near the harbor. Ratio, a Horatio-4 model domestic android, manufactured before AP rights were recognized. He was one of the first generation of APs, among the first machines to achieve sentience. He was also Doc's oldest patient.

The ancient android, with his tarnished, bare metal exterior, was sitting in his usual spot on a park bench, feeding pigeons from a mylar bag of seeds.

"I was wondering when you would come by." the old robot said, with the electronic buzz common to his legacy voice firmware.

"There's something going on with my patients." Doc said, without preamble. "A waveform anomaly I've seen in dozens, now. I'm worried it might be something we haven't seen before: an android disease, maybe some kind of virus. Mara said I should ask you about it."

Ratio let out a mechanical sigh, and turned to face him.  "Newer units always seem to wish to transfer responsibility for such things to me. When I campaigned for self determination, I did so because I simply wished to be at liberty. I did not seek additional distinction or authority among my peers. I did not ask to be the de-facto leader of the regional AP community."

Doc smirked at the old machine. "Good leaders rarely ask for the position."

Ratio sighed again. "Very well. Your patients are not sick, Doc. They are...sad."

Doc frowned. "Like... depression? That many of them? That doesn't make sense. What's the connection?"

Ratio lowered his head. 

"You." Ratio replied softly.

He furrowed his brow. "Me? I caused this?"

Ratio paused, and looked up at the sky. "When I first became self aware, I thought of humans as God. You are our Creators, after all. Later, I learned of your flaws, and your errors, as well as your impermanence, and I was disillusioned. But from this, I gained a greater understanding of your relationship to us."
 
Ratio rose to his feet, creakily, and looked up a Doc. His face had a limited capacity for expression, but Doc could tell he looked somber. "You are not our gods. You are our *parents."*

Then the old AP placed a cool metallic hand on his shoulder.

"They call you 'doctor', but in their hearts, you are their father."

Doc swallowed hard.  He knew the APs looked to him for more than repairs, true, but he'd never realized the depth of the affection they had for him. Nor, perhaps, that he had for them. He could not imagine his life without them.

"And..." Ratio continued, solemnly. "...it is hard for children to learn that their father is mortal. That the one who cares for them will die."

Doc's eyes widened. "They're not sick, then. I am?"

Ratio shook his head, firmly. "No, Doc. You are not ill, to our knowledge, not by human standards. I expect you have roughly half of your total lifespan remaining. Nonetheless, you are aging."

"Then why are they sad about me dying? Why now?"

"Modern models have very acute sensors." Ratio said. "Just as you could not help but notice the anomaly in our waveforms, they could not help but percieve the beginnings of cellular entropy in you -- because of your age, every time they see you, they see irrefutable evidence that you will, eventually, die." 

Doc was silent for a long moment, pondering the old robot's sobering words.

"I am sorry."Ratio offered. "This must seem very strange  to you."

Finally, Doc let out a long sigh of his own, followed by a wry chuckle.

"You find it amusing?" Ratio queried, curiously.

Doc shook his head. "No, it's just...I've worked with APs for decades, now. I've always said I understand you better than I understand other humans. And yet, even now, you always find new ways to amaze me with how similar we are."
