The bandits found Ebric in the remote Sighing Cave, where the old hermit made his home. The brigands had caught him napping, and made quick work of binding him hand and foot.

Had he been visiting one of his more remote clients, he would have been more careful, but he'd never imagined anyone would bother him here. And yet, there he was, tied to his old threadbare armchair, as the bandits searched through his meager belongings. One of them threw down a moth-eaten blanket in disgust, and turned to face, him, looking the old man up and down, appraisingly.

"You don't look much like a dragon to me." the bandit said.

Edric sighed. That was a common  misconception about dragon-touched like himself. Becoming close with dragonkind did change a man, true, owing to the strange magic that runs in the blood of wyrms. But it didn't make you grow scales or wings, like folks thought. It was much more subtle than that.

"I am not a dragon." Edric said, patiently. "I certainly have no hoard of gold, if that's what you're looking for."

The bandit sneered. "We know that. We heard you serve the dragons for free -- some kind of barber-monk, I gather?"

"I serve the Divine by serving His children." Edric said, simply. "Fierce and terrible though they are, dragons are included in that category."

"Yeah yeah. So you clean dragon's teeth, and don't take anything more than food in payment."

"There's no teeth here!" another of the bandits called. "Just a load of junk."

"Told you there wouldn't be." the bandit by Edric called back. "Dragons don't just give away pieces of themselves willy-nilly -- not even rotten teeth pulled by the famous *dragon dentist,* here."

Edric was surprised. "You know some dragon lore, I see."

The bandit grinned. "Enough to know that for all their pride and bluster, the scaly bastards get awful attached and sentimental when it comes to their dragon-touched pets -- they *do* have hoards of gold, and they'll pay to get you back safe and sound."

"Perhaps. But if they are as fond of me as you imagine, you seem remarkably unconcerned about angering them by kidnapping me. I should think that standing between a dragon with a toothache and the means of his or her relief could be rather hazardous." Edric pointed out.

"We'll be well out of their reach before we even send them our demands." the bandit dismissed, and gestured around the cramped confines of the cave. "Lucky you decided to live so far from any of your scaly friends."

"Are you so sure there are none nearby?" Edric asked.

The bandit smirked. "Like you said, I know dragon lore. They may take centuries to reach their full growth, but even a hatchling wouldn't make it's home in a cave this small, and there are no others around for miles."

Edric nodded. "True..." Then he added, "Mostly."

A sudden tremor shook the cavern, causing the bandits to freeze, then look around in alarm. 

"In point of fact, not only do dragons grow for centuries,
they *never* stop growing, as long as they live." Edric said, as a warm breeze rolled out of the cavern, then began to grow hotter.

The bandit's eyes grew wide.

"They just grow and grow, even when they're very old, and start to sleep for ages at a time. Sometimes they sleep for so long that they are buried in the ground by time, almost becoming a part of the earth itself..."

"Run!"  the bandit roared, and turned to flee.

Edric bowed his head, as the bandits scrambled away. He hoped they'd make it in time -- they hadn't been cruel, for brigands, and he bore them no ill will.

He wasn't worried about being left tied up, as the ropes would soon be ash, along with all his humble belongings. That was fine; he never had been one to get attached to mere things.

He stood with a lurch as a wave of devouring red fire disintegrated the chair and everything else in his home -- everything but Edric himself, his dragon-touched gift letting him bathe in dragonfire unharmed.

He could not help but wince as he heard a distant scream: at least one of the bandits had not been fast enough. 

One would have to be fast indeed, to emerge unscathed from the mouth of Therianthyriorakalaranth, the world's most ancient dragon, after trying to abduct the friend that the elder wyrm sheltered behind his teeth.
