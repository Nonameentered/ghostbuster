"This really doesn't seem fair." I called towards the luxurious box overlooking the arena, where the aliens dressed in ancient Roman  garb presided over the grisly festivities. I don't know why I bothered.

If you were going to kidnap people -- ostensibly great warriors, which made me puzzled as to why *I* had been included -- from various periods in human history, hand them culturally appropriate weapons, and make them fight to the death for your entertainment, then *fairness* probably wasn't high on your list of priorities.

Plus, I don't think they spoke English.

The portcullis opposite me opened. A swarthy warrior with long dark hair, clad in leather armor, bearing a trident in one hand, and a net in the other, strode out onto the blood-stained sand of the alien arena. I took an involuntary step back.

The warrior bellowed a challenge in a language I didn't understand.

"I don't know what that means, but I don't want to fight!" I shouted back.

He ignored me, continuing to stalk forward with a confident sneer.

"Please don't." I pleaded, shifting from foot to foot nervously.

He kept coming.

"I'm not even a warrior! I'm just *some guy.* There's no, uh...*honor* in this, or whatever!" I uselessly insisted to the man, who clearly didn't know my language any better than I knew his.

He didn't stop.

"Let's team up instead?" I offered, desperately, extending my hand in friendship.

He advanced, drawing back his trident. He was not going to shake my hand.

"Come *on!"* I shouted, crossly, resorting to the universal last-ditch argument of my childhood.

Alas, he did not seem amenable to coming on.

So, with a heavy sigh, when he was just a few yards away, I dropped into a Weaver stance, lifted my pistol, and shot him three times in the chest.

I hadn't lied. I wasn't a warrior, or a soldier, or even a cop. But I was from 21st Century Montana, and I knew how to use the weapons of my culture and time period: firearms.

The warrior fell to the sand, writhed for a moment, and then lay still. For some reason, the aliens *cheered.* They were clearly enamored with the trappings of historical human bloodsports, but it was just as clear that the *nuances* of such events escaped them. Two humans enter, one human leaves -- as long as that happened, they were happy.

Like I said, it really didn't seem fair.
