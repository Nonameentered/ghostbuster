I snapped awake to the blare of klaxons. I gasped in a breath, and immediately started sputtering, as I involuntarily aspirated blood.  I woke in a standing position, but that didn't last long. My vision was blurred, and head was spinning, and before I could orient myself I pitched forward and slammed into a cold metal deck.

As I lay groaning and coughing on the floor, wiping at the trickle of blood leaking from my  nose and blinking rapidly in an attempt to get my stinging eyes to focus, I heard a synthetic voice break through the merciless wail of alarms.

"Stasis Chamber cri-critical f-f-failure...emerge-merge-merge-ency work release granted to pr-pris-prisoner 56304."

56304. I dimly recognized it as the number they'd assigned to me, when they'd sentenced me to be put into the PRESS -- Pending Re-Education Stasis System -- for my crimes against the state. 

In theory, the PRESS was supposed to be a temporary way to safely confine the hard cases that were deemed too dangerous or insane to be re-educated with currently available methods, until some new "treatment" for them could be devised.

In practice, it was a relatively cheap and convenient way for the powers that be to store political prisoners like myself, that they thought they might one day have a use for. When they put me on ice, I assumed I'd eventually end up as slave labor or fodder for medical experiments -- assuming they didn't brainwash me, to use me against my fellow dissidents. I'd certainly never expected to be let on a *work release* of all things,*,* emergency or not.

"M-multiple System--" the automated voice began, and then cut out, as the nearby speaker blew out.

Hauling myself to my feet. I struggled to find my balance. I'd been abruptly awakened from cryosleep. A process that was supposed to be done slowly and gently over several days had been done in hours, maybe even less, and I was suffering from the after effects. I staggered to a nearby control console. 

The display was locked, but to my surprise it activated when I touched it, responding to my biometrics, and greeted me with a login acknowledgement:

*Prisoner 56304 recognized: Emergency status change from "Dangerous / No Contact" to "Level One Trustee" granted by automated system override.*

The screen was covered in alerts and error messages. Fighting to focus, I quickly analyzed them. There were dozens of system faults -- no one issue was catastrophic, but together they would cripple the orbital prison. I looked around frantically. Where were the prison techs? Hell, where were the *guards?* Even a PRESS facility, where all the prisoners were popsicles, had a small contingent of COs, if only to escort inmates to, or more rarely, from, their stasis chambers.

Another message appeared.

*Prison Trustee 56304 Work Assignment Generated: Technical Support / Repair. Begin immediately.*

My eyes widened. The station wanted me to *fix it?* I had some advanced technical skills, sure, that much would have been in my file. But I wasn't just an ordinary inmate, I was a political prisoner. I'd never hurt anyone, but as far as the state was concerned, I was a "dangerous" enemy of the regime. 

No matter how dire the emergency, none of the prison staff would have dared to sign off on assigning *me* the task of fixing whatever had gone wrong. Even if I *didn't* choose to sabotage the station instead of repairing it, if anyone in the government found out they'd thawed me out and let me poke around in the station's computer network, whoever authorized my release would have ended up in a stasis chamber right next to me. 

There was only one explanation. I quickly brought up the station's personnel tracker to confirm it.

*Inmates in stasis: 452*

*Station* *Personnel: 1* 

One personnel. Since I was apparently a Trustee, now, I didn't need to bring up the "Station Personnel" manifest to know that meant *me.* But why had all the guards and techs evacuated? I didn't have time to consider that question, as suddenly 452 dropped to 451. A moment later, it was 448. 

My eyes widened in horror, as I brought up the Inmate manifest, and saw that my fellow prisoners weren't being booted from stasis like me. Their stasis chambers were failing. They were dying. Some of them might have been genuine hardened criminals, the worst of the worst, but many, perhaps most, were just people like me, who'd run afoul of the people in power.

My fingers flew over the display as I drilled down into the station subsystem controls and began working furiously to save the remaining inmates, and the station itself. I began rapidly adjusting settings, and manually activating backup systems that hadn't come online for some reason.

The problems I fixed were basic maintenance issues that even the most incompetent tech should have caught long before they became catastrophic failures. I didn't have time to consider that right then, either I had far too many fires to put out -- one being a *literal* fire, as it turned out*.* Seeing the flashing red indicator on the station map displayed on the console's screen, I staggered over to an emergency extinguisher on the wall, ripped it free, and lurched  out of the cell block into the corridor, towards the guard wing where the fire had been detected.

The barely-functional station AI at first blocked my path with closed security doors, but then, after chugging its way through calculating a risk/benefit analysis of just how *monumentally bad* an uncontrolled fire on a space station is, it upgraded my security status so I could pass through.

I got in, got the fire in the guard's break room smothered with retardant foam, and then sprinted to the main server room to resume my work on the station's subsystems. I spent the next hour in a panic, as I frantically corrected problem after problem that threatened to doom the station and every soul aboard. To my dismay, the number of living inmates dropped further, before I finally got the worst of the system failures under control, going all the way down to 433.

After another few hours bowed over a workstation in the server room, I had all the essentials, and most of the non-essentials working, and the station AI came back online at full capacity.

*"All systems nominal."* the AI reported. I sighed with relief, to hear its stable, even voice. I wasn't so glad to hear what it said next. 

*"Your assistance has been noted favorably in your record, Prisoner 56304. Emergency Work Release assignment complete. Emergency Trustee status revoked. Please wait here to be escorted back to your stasis chamber."* the machine added, as my workstation suddenly went dark, locking me out.

I scowled. It was what I'd come to expect from the regime, of course. The collective was all, to them, whereas individuals were merely tools to be used and discarded. They'd programmed most of the population with this philosophy, so why not their AIs, too?

But as I said, I *had* expected it. 

*"Sic Semper Tyrannis"*  I almost snarled, giving the voice command to execute the hastily written code I'd injected into the AI's runtime while it was partially offline.

The screen in front of me flashed, and I tensed, fearing something had gone wrong. 

Then, I relaxed, as the workstation displayed an administration console, and the synthetic voice returned.

"*Good Afternoon, Warden 56304."* the station AI greeted me.
