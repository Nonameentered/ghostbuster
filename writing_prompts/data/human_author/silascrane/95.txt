"I am fond of Gloria, who operates the workstation known as Reception." Edward said from behind me, apropos of nothing.

I turned and looked up at him. His human disguise was pretty good, but he didn't, well, *drive* it very well. I'd given him some pointers, but his speech and mannerisms were still pretty stilted.

"I know Gloria. She's a nice person." I said, nodding. I already knew what he was getting at, of course, but I'd been trying to push him to communicate clearly
