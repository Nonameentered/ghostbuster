"Careful, Graver Moss." Sanders said with a snarl, as he pulled the prisoner forward. "This one's a fighter."

Irwin Moss, the intake Graver, sized up the prisoner. The soon-to-be inmate of Granite Tor was younger then himself, still more boy than man, with the awkward gangliness of adolescence. He gave a derisive snort.

"Name?" Moss asked, with a practiced yawn, prepared to check it against the documents provided for this morning's intake.

The prisoner scowled at the ground, silently.

Sanders grabbed the boy's hair, and jerked his head up, forcing him to look at moss.

"The Graver asked you a question, caster!" the guard hissed into his charge's ear. 

"Why don't he just ask your mother, she was screaming it last ni--" the boy spat, before his words were cut off with a cry of pain, as Sanders struck the back of his knees with his cudgel, and he crumpled to the ground.

"Sanders doesn't get to use his cudgel as often as he'd like." Moss said, with a sigh, looking down at the prisoner on the ground. "Trust me, you don't want to offer him the opportunity to *practice."*

Sanders grinned, tapping the short wooden club on his palm as the prisoner struggled to his feet, rune-scribed chains rattling. 

"Garen Wheeler." the boy spat.

Moss nodded, signing the intake form. He gestured to the prisoner. "Take the chains off him, I'll take him back myself."  

Sanders raised his eyebrows. "You sure, Graver?"

He nodded again. "Yeah -- it's a slow day, it'll give me a chance to stretch my legs."

"Suit yourself. He's a scrapper, though." Sanders warned again, as he got out his keyring, and began unfastening the lock that held the chains on the runic manacles -- those, of course, stayed locked.

"Without his magic, he's just a scrawny kid." Moss said with a shrug, ignoring the prisoner's hateful glare.

Once he was unchained, Moss took a firm hold on Garen's collar, and led the boy out, sparing Sanders only a quick nod in farewell.

"Graver." the boy spat, as he was pulled along. "You lot are nothing but second-rate magi, you know that?"

"We're not magi." Moss said, tiredly, as he marched the young inmate down the rows of cells holding solemn, quiet inmates, some even sleeping in the middle of the day. "You don't need magic to scribe the signs that bind it. Like the ones on your manacles, for example. Did those myself."

"Bullshit." Garen retorted. "I bet you've got a little magic in you, or your bloody scribbles wouldn't work -- you just haven't got enough to perform any real workings. Just enough to whore yourself out to the Witchfinders. Izzat why you do it, Graver? Jealous of people with *real* magic?"

"Here's your stop," Moss said, as they stopped before an empty cell. He opened the cell door, and shoved Garen inside, before turning to walk away without another word. 

"Bastard!" Garen shouted after him. "Traitor!"

Thrusting his hands into his pockets, Moss smiled.

\---

Garen sat on the cold stone floor of his cell, his back against the edge of his cot, staring  down at his manacled wrists. His bravado had begun to fade after the first few hours alone in his cell, his anger giving way to cold dread.

He had no one to talk to, though Granite Tor was ostensibly full of his fellow magi. The manacled prisoner in the adjacent cell to his right had been one of those lightly dozing, and had gruffly told him to stuff it, when Garen tried to engage him in conversation. The old woman in the cell on his left had been sleeping too soundly to even stir at the sound of his voice. 

The miserable silence of the prison was unbroken until a distant voice called "*Lights out!"* The call was echoed  a half dozen times by other voices around the prison, and few moments later, the gas lights providing the dim illumination inside the prison went off, evidently stopped by a central valve.

Garden hugged his knees to his chest, huddled in the darkness of his cell. He'd find a way out of this, he told himself. Somehow.

Then, to his surprise, the lights came back on. But not with the dull yellow glow that had lit the cell block before. Now, the gas flames burned violet, casting pale purple light.  He looked around in confusion, as he heard the sounds of his fellow inmates stirring, rising in masse. 

The man in the cell on the right, a rail thin elder with a long wispy beard, rolled out of bed and onto his feet with surprisingly alacrity for a man his age. 

"Mornin' new boy!" he said, cheerfully. "I'm Lorik! What's your name, then?"

"Now you want to talk?" Garen said, eyeing the old man warily.

"I was trying to *sleep."* he said, defensively. Then, to Garen's astonishment, he flicked his wrists towards his cell door, and it sprang open. The old man stretched and yawned as he walked out into the hallway.

"You know the Latchkey Charm, young master....?" the old man inquired.

"G-Garen." Garen stammered, staring in amazement. "Uh, I...no, I don't know that spell." 

"No worries, young Garen, no worries at all." Lorik said, flashing a grin that seemed to glow white.

His neighbour made a similar arcane gesture towards the door of Garen's cell, and Garen quickly stumbled to his feet and out of his cell  as it swung open. Looking up and down the hall, he saw prisoners all over the cell block likewise stepping out of their open cells, and filing calmly down the corridor. 

"What's happening? Are we escaping?" Garen asked, wide-eyed.

Lorik laughed. "What, so we could get dragged back here by the Witchfinders again -- or worse? No, no. Follow me, lad."

"How is this possible?" Garen asked, looking around wide eyed. One young woman skated past as though on ice, her feet trailing magical sparks. Another old man floated leisurely down the hall, seated cross-legged on sheet he'd enchanted into a makeshift flying carpet. He'd never seen such brazen, casual use of magic in the outside world, let alone imagined he'd find it in the mage-binding prison of Granite Tor.

"Look at your bracelets." Lorik advised, without breaking step.

Garen looked down at the manacles he still wore, that supposedly kept his magic sealed away. In addition to the hateful binding runes that circled them, etched into the metal, two new runes had appeared on the surface of the bracelets, glowing in the strange purple light. 

"Blocking runes, inscribed at the beginning and end of the runes on the manacles, and the other rune wards around the prison." Lorik explained, as they filed into a large open commons at the end of the hallway, where dozens of other imprisoned magi had already gathered. "They're painted onto the manacles with a special enamel that's normally invisible, but that glows brightly under the purple gaslight -- once they're aglow, they become active, and cancel out all the runes etched in between them."

Garen nodded, thoughtfully. He noticed them along the walls and ceilings, as well, small glowing blocking runes that had appeared, cancelling out discrete magic-nullifying inscriptions etched into the prison walls themselves. 

"But...how? Why?" Garen asked, as they fell in with a group of other mages.

Lorik smirked, and gestured towards a walkway overlooking the commons. "Best hear that from the *archmage* himself.*"*

From the midst of the assembled mages, a hooded figure floated into the air, and then touched down lightly on the walkway. As he threw back his hood, Garen's jaw dropped.

"Good morning, everyone." Graver Moss, the archmage, said, and smiled down at the crowd.
