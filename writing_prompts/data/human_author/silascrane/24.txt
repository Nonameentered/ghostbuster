Gwendolyn suddenly found herself lying in bed, unable to move. As her eyes slowly focused, she recognized a face looming over her: Dr. Livingstone!

"Poison..." she croaked, barely finding the strength to utter the word.

"No, no," Dr. Livingstone said, mildly. "Merely a sedative."

The door behind Livingstone was open, and through it she suddenly saw Emily being carried past, held between a pair of burly men in white coats as she struggled, thrashed, and -- strangest of all -- hissed and spat at them. 

"E-Emily..." Gwendolyn managed to say.

*"Emily,* dear?" Another speaker leaned into view, holding a mangy black cat. Gwendolyn's eyes went wide. The woman looked exactly like her! She even wore her dress!

"Here she is," the woman crooned, setting the cat down on the bed, as the pathetic little stray mewed forlornly. "I wouldn't dream of separating you two!"

"Wh-what..." Gwendolyn rasped.

"I was inspired by Marconi and Fesseden," Livingston said, thoughtfully, as the woman who looked like Gwendolyn came to his side. "They showed how a man's voice could be sent out through the air to another location, riding on an electromagnetic wave. I thought, if one can transfer a man's voice in this way, why not *more* of his essence? Why not even his -- or, in this case, *her..."*

"...her *very soul."* the woman who looked like Gwendolyn finished for him, looking up at the young doctor, adoringly. She stroked the cat's back fondly, and it cringed away from her hand.

"Oh, sorry, Emmy dear. But Bryan *did* have to test his machine somehow, after all." she explained. Then she looked back at Gwendolyn, with a wicked smile. "And to you as well, Gwen. It's just that, alas, *polio* tends to be a very demanding disease, and I...well, I've got a *wedding* to plan!"
