Brazak the Brutal hefted his mithral axe, grunting in approval as its magically-honed edge whistled through the air as he gave it several experimental swings. Heironymus, the  cleric of the Sun Abbey, beamed beatifically his new staff, a holy relic of his faith once thought lost to history. Randol, the group's cunning leader and peerless thief, was almost as entranced by the long slender dagger of black metal, the mystically balanced weapon easily held perfectly upright with a single fingertip on the pommel.

Kefira, ranger of the Elderwoods, on the other hand, stared at her prize in confusion.

"Where's the arm?" she said, cocking her head to the side curiously as she awkwardly held the strange, vaguely crossbow-like weapon.

The Grand Wizard, the employer who had rewarded the adventurers with their new acquisitions for completing their latest assignment, grinned slyly, causing all of the adventurers to shift uncomfortably from foot to foot. His smiles were always deeply unsettling, for some reason.

"Close your eyes and concentrate, my dear elf." the wizard purred, sweeping forward towards Kefira, his unusually tailored white cloak billowing around him. "Let the weapon tell you how to wield it."

Nervously -- none of the adventurers liked the idea of closing their eyes when the Grand Wizard was in the room -- Kefira did as instructed. The party members jumped in surprise, the the armless crossbow belched forth booming report of fire and thunder, blasting several small holes into the far wall.

Kefira's eyes snapped open.

"Hoo...hoorah?" she said, uncertainly.

The Grand Wizard grinned a grin that seemed to wide for his face. "Mmm....this weapon is from another world, my dear. In that place, I obtained the services of a certain mortal man, a former soldier proficient with such weapons. Unlike yourselves, however, his desire was not a new weapon, no -- he was far too deeply in love with the one he already wielded. Instead, knowing the depth of my power, his wish was to *become* the weapon he loved, to be able to fight forever  as an ageless engine of destruction. I gave him his wish, and I now give him to you. Knowing your reputation for destruction, I am confident you two will be a good match."

Kefira nodded mutely, awed both by the potency of her otherworldly armament, and the uncanny power of the Grand Wizard.

Randol cleared his throat, and was the first to break the silence. Eyeing the Grand Wizard in his strange white robes, he asked, hesitantly, "So...Grand Wizard...I uh, I believe you said if we completed our last assignment, you'd have another job for us?"

The unsettling man nodded, his skin-crawling grin returning. "Oh yes. As it happens, your next assignment will take you to the very world I just mentioned. On that world, I am a high ranking member of a...certain secret organization. It is a very important time of year for us, and I shall require some assistance."

Randol nodded. As uncomfortable as their employer always made them, the payment he offered was peerless. "Well then, when do you need us?"

"Tonight." the Grand Wizard said, licking his lips eagerly.

"Tonight?" Randol repeated, surprised. Normally it was a few weeks between the weird mage's assignment.

"Tonight," the wizard affirmed, with a silky smile.["I wouldn't change places with anyone, tonight."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6089Z_NgPk)
