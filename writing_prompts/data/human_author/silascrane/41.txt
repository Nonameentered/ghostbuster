"I...have doubts." Lector Dane said to the Arch-Prior.

The elder cultist's eyes widened in surprise. "You, Lector Dane? Caretaker of our Dark Master's son? The demonic dula of Satan's scion? Surely not!"

"That's just it! Master...I begin to doubt young Louis is the son of our Dark Lord." Dane said.

"Don't be foolish! But three years old, yet he is already filled with our lord's malice! See, there, how he delights in torturing that hapless beast he's ensnared!" The Arch-Prior exclaimed, gesturing down into the courtyard below, where the child was crouched on the grass beneath an oak tree, holding a small furry creature.

Dane glanced at the small boy, and frowned. Louis was holding out a handful of sunflower seeds to a squirrel seated on his palm, which in turn was stuffing it's cheeks with the crunchy treats the boy offered. The boy gently scratched the top of the little rodent's head, causing it to chirr happily.

"Arch-Prior...I believe he is *befriending* the creature."

The Arch-Prior paused, and removed a pair of thick glasses from his robe. After fogging them and polishing them clear on his voluminous sleeve, he donned them, and peered at the wholesome scene playing out below.

"Well..." the old man began, hesitantly. "He's....he's probably only showing kindness to the beast *now* to...to *heighten* its despair when he later betrays it!"

"The antichrist is plotting the downfall of a squirrel?" Dane asked, flatly.

"Well, you've got to start somewhere!" The Arch-Prior snapped.

"What about *this?"* Dane demanded, thrusting a sheet of paper at his superior. "Is *this* the work of Satan's only-begotten?" 

The old man examined the paper. It was a child's drawing depicting a small, smiling stick figure holding hands with a larger stick figure in a robe. The figures were neatly labelled "me" and "unky Dane" in crayon. 

"Aha!" The Arch-Prior crowed. "A three year old child, *writing legibly?* That's obviously supernatural! He already receives a measure of our master's dark wisdom! I bet he'll be screaming blasphemies in ancient Greek, soon enough!"

"He's *homeschooled,*" Dane pointed out, "Simple writing at his age isn't actually that uncommon, outside of public education."

"He was born with the *number of the beast* in a birthmark on his scalp! 666!" The Arch-Prior insisted, crossly. "That ought to be enough!"

"About that," Dane said, handing the prior another sheet of paper. "I was looking at the mark closely, the last time I cut his hair. I sketched it for you -- do you notice anything about it?"

"It says six-six-six!" The old man said, stubbornly.

"But what else is there?"

"Well, 666...with a line over it. So what?"

Dane shook his head. "No, no. Haven't you ever played pool? They number the balls, but since they can roll any direction, they put a line under six and nine to indicate the *bottom* of the number."

The Arch-Prior's eyes widened. "You mean..."

Dane nodded. "The birthmark says *999,* not 666."

The old man groaned, his shoulders sagging. "Damn it! *God* must be screwing with us, again!"

"So, what now?" Dane asked, after an uncomfortable silence.

"Well, I guess we sacrifice *this* kid to Satan, and hope he's not too pissed off that we got taken for a ride." the old man sighed.

Dane nodded and placed a hand on the old man's shoulder. "I was afraid you'd say that."

The Arch-Prior frowned "What do you mean?"

"Well, the kid may not be the antichrist, but I did learn  one thing from him, by raising him for the last three years." Dane explained.

"What's that?"

Dane leaned close the old man's ear, and whispered,

"I learned that I like him a lot more than I like *you."*

The Arch-Prior didn't have time to reply before Dane tightened his grip on the old man's shoulder, and shoved him over the high wall surrounding the courtyard -- opposite the side where his young charge was at play, of course.

Leaning over the wall, Dane looked down at the twisted body of his former mentor, the old cultist's face frozen forever in a stare of horrified realization. Part of him felt guilty...but a larger part of him felt that he'd done what anyone would, in his position. Satan, after all, was clearly not Louis' father. Therefore, Dane decided, that position had needed to be filled -- and he'd had his doubts about his previous job for a while, anyway.

Dane pulled his cult robe over his head, and tossed it over the wall, watching it flutter down to join the Arch-Prior's corpse on the ground outside the wall.

"Unky Dane!" Louis called up from the courtyard. "Is Unky Pri'er gonna come down an' play?"

Dane turned, and looked back down into the courtyard. Louis beamed up at him happily, his squirrel friend now perched on his little shoulder.

Dane gave the lad a wan smile. "No, sorry, kiddo....he had to go."
