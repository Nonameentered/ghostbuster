Dragons are not real, as Tanner's parents had explained, when he was old enough to understand. At least, not in the way that Tanner, his parents, and old Mrs. Baker down the road were real.

At first, Tanner was outraged. If dragons were not real, he had demanded, why had his parents given him a traditional dragon bank for his birthday three years past, and encouraged him to deposit his spending money in it, in the hopes of attracting one? He had even sought out extra work and chores to swell his tiny hoard of coins, when he could otherwise have been playing with his friends.

The gentle deception had been for his own good, they insisted. Dragons, they explained, were fanciful inventions of Tanner's superstitious ancestors, and in that sense, they were not real. 

However, as metaphors for wisdom, wealth, and long life, dragons were very real. By working to earn money for to fill his little fired-clay bank - made in the traditional shape of a miniature dais where a dragon hatchling could ostensibly rest, and etched with nonsensical symbols that were claimed to be dragon-runes -- Tanner had developed habits of hard work and thriftiness that would, ultimately, make him wiser, wealthier, and healthier. 

So, according to his parents, he had, in a sense, attracted a dragon as they'd promised. Not one that was a literal being, of course, but one that was a part of his own character and personality -- and that "dragon", mother and father assured him, would serve him well all his days.

He gradually came to accept the benevolent nature of the deception. While other boys his age never had more than two coins to rub together, Tanner had saved a tidy sum.  Another summer or two of odd jobs, and he could afford his own riding horse. Grudgingly, he accepted the wisdom of his parents' charade, and the fundamental unreality if dragons as anything but an object lesson.

Which is why he was surprised to come home one evening, after helping Farmer Greene bring in the pumpkin crop for two silver pennies, and discover his clay bank smashed to pieces on the rough oak table beside his bed.

This outrage would have consumed his attention utterly, were it not for the cat-sized winged reptile curled up among the scattered clay shards, resting atop his carefully hoarded coins.

Though tiny, it was among the most regal creatures he had ever seen. It was graced with a slender, triangular head, a sinuous tail, delicate membranous wings, and golden scales that caught the flickering light of the gas lamp on his wall, and sparkled in a way that far outshone the meager pile of coins it perched on. It regarded him with large, emerald-green eyes as he stared, and then, after a moment, it spoke.

"This hoard is sufficient." it announced, in a high chirping voice. "Enough for me to accept your written  offer of a pact, anyway. Not that I'm spoiled for choice."

It delicately picked up a tiny shard of clay from the broken bank between two claws, and then threw it at him. He could only stare dumbly as it bounced off his forehead.

"The accomodations, not so much." the little dragon sneered, derisively. "I'm a dragon, not a mouse!"
