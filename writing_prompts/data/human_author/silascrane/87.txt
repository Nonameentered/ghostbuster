Sometimes when inspiration strikes, I'll write on my phone. Because of this, I've written stories in my car (while parked, relax) at the park, in bed, in hospital waiting rooms, at food courts, and in restaurants. I don't find that environment effects inspiration, for me -- it's just a matter of comfort and efficiency that brings me back to my desk.
