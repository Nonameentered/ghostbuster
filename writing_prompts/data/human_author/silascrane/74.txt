"Does it ever...*bother you?"* I asked Grandpa Reginald.

The old ghost looked up from our game of chess which he was participating in with the aid of the spindly mechanical arms mounted on his ectomatic pedestal.

He raised his translucent eyebrows. "Hm? Does *what* bother me, my boy?" Reginald asked.

"You know...being dead?"

He snorted. "I should say not! What do I look like, one of those 'ectolutionary' malcontents? No, indeed lad. You know what bothered me? Arthritis! Shingles!" He raised his translucent joss-craft pipe, puffed on it, and exhaled a cloud of ghostly smoke with a contented sigh. *"Lung cancer!* And none of *those* things bother me anymore. I'm quite content."

"But," I pressed. "Your body is shambling around somewhere out there, being used by the Royal Necroverseers to plow fields, build bridges -- doesn't that feel wrong, to you?"

He shrugged. "Why should it? You know, I took up bicycling a few years before I died -- thought it would be good for my constitution. But in the end, a few months later, I decided it wasn't for me, and I gave my bicycle to a charity shop." 

He gestured to the window with his pipe. "Now, I expect someone's riding the damn contraption about in my stead, somewhere out there. That doesn't bother me. Because I was *done* with it, you see? That's my problem with the bloody ectolutionists. I think it's rather *stingy* to begrudge society the productive use of one's corpse when one no longer needs it. They're the sort of people who'd sooner let a bicycle sit and rust than give it away, or at least sell it second-hand so someone else could have a go. *Miserly,* if you ask me."

"But spirits can't rest in peace when their bodies are made into undead workers." I protested.

"So? Good heavens, lad -- I can fly, walk through walls, even teleport a bit if I really set my mind to it! All that, and I don't get tired. Who the devil wants to *sleep,* peacefully or otherwise?"

"I never thought you'd be so accommodating about being made into a farmer." I said, wryly.

"Well, maybe my body *isn't* farming." He said, gesturing to a masked figure serving drinks elsewhere in the room. It was one of the domestic undead, it's lifeless face discretely concealed by a porcelain mask, as were all the revenant workers that had to interact with people. "For all we know, *that's* my mortal husk over there. But even if it *is* out digging ditches or dunging crops, well, what do *I* care?"

The clock on the wall chimed, and I sighed. "I'm afraid I've got to get going, Grandpa. We'll have to pick up discussion -- and our game -- on Monday."

"Not tomorrow?" The old ghost said, sounding disappointed.

I usually tried to visit him in the City Ectopolis every weekday, but tomorrow I had an appointment elsewhere.

"I'm afraid I won't be able to make it on Friday -- business out of town, you see." I said, apologetically. 

He brightened. "Ah! Putting that business acumen you inherited from me to good use, eh? Very well, say no more. But, ah, as you won't be coming tomorrow, did you perhaps bring..."

He trailed off, hesitantly. My eyes widened, I'd almost forgot. "Oh! Sorry, of course."

I pulled the small bag from my coat, and emptied it's contents into the ashtray by the chessboard. The bag contained tiny paper miniatures of various luxury items -- bottles of wine, a box of cigars, brandy, tins of caviar, and so forth. Taking out my lighter, I unceremoniously lit them ablaze, and watched the fragile paper burn with a pale green flame.


The joss-crafted items were made by people who had experienced the objects they represented with all five senses. It was this sense memory, mystically imbued into the magical joss paper, that made them work. As the objects burned away, full sized ghostly versions appeared next to Grandpa Reginald, who gratefully gathered them up.

"You're a good lad." He said, beaming at me proudly. 

I smiled modestly, "See you Monday."

Bidding my deceased ancestor farewell, I walked out of the grand hall of the Ectopolis, and out into the street. 

*Well, * I thought, *Grandfather's sympathies clearly don't lie with the ectolutionists...* 

Reaching into my pocket, I brushed my fingers over the tiny gold coin I kept there. The token I could use in the rare case that I needed to identify myself as a member of the Royal Secret Police.

*...so how the hell am I going to find a way to infiltrate them?*
