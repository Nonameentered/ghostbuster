"Brazak is strongest of all!" Brazak the Brutal bellowed, angrily, as he slammed his warhammer into the ancient adamantine gate again and again. His companions, Randol the Sly and Kefira Woodborn both covered their ears, as the ten-foot high panels of the portal into the ancient treasury rang like a colossal gong under the warhammer's onslaught.

The ground trembled, and dust and chips of stone rained down from the cavern ceiling onto the trio of adventurers, but the metal gates themselves were left unmarked by Brazak's mighty maul, and hadn't budged an inch.

"Brazak, stop!" Kefira shouted, wincing as she kept her hands clamped down over her sensitive elven ears.

"Brazak!" Randol screamed, desperately. "It's not working!"

But neither of them could be heard over the the incessant ringing. The intolerable clanging of metal on metal resonating through the cavernous chamber forced them to retreat a fair distance back into the passageway that had led them there, and wait until their barbarian ally tired himself out.

When the ringing of the hammer finally stopped, the pair returned to find Brazak on his knees before the gates, his weapon laying on the ground beside him. The man was breathing heavily, but was otherwise unharmed.

"I can't believe your ears aren't gushing blood after all that!" Randol exclaimed angrily, as he stomped back into the gate chamber, a hand on the side of his head.

"I'm going to have a headache for the next *century..."* Kefira groaned.

"How? Brazak...Brazak is strongest of all..." Brazak muttered wearily, in between gasping breaths. "Brazak has power of--"

"The power of your clan's *Mighty Bear Spirit."* Randol finished, rolling his eyes. "We know! You've only told us about a million times since we met you."

"Those gates are solid *adamantine,* Brazak," Kefira added, crossly. "It's doesn't matter how strong you are, nothing short of the most powerful magic can break tempered adamant!"

"I knew we should have hired a wizard." Randol sighed, approaching the intact gate and peering at its intricately inscribed surface."Failing that, we'll just have to solve the mystery of these cryptic runes on the gates ourselves."

Kefira nodded, and stepped up to the gates beside Randol, inspecting the symbols. "Neither elf nor dwarf made these markings."

Randol shook his head. "Well, it's no human script I know of, either."

Brazak scratched his head. "Reading? Can *read* door open?" He shrugged. "Okay. Brazak help read."

"Brazak," Randol said, eyeing the barbarian skeptically. "Listen, buddy, old pal, you're *really* strong, and that's very impressive and all, but I don't think the mighty bear spirit of clan whatever is going to be much help in this scenario. Maybe just sit this one out, okay?"

Kefira winced at Randol's bluntness, but didn't gainsay him. Brazak snorted, and then, apropos of nothing, he stood up and tore off his shirt.

Randol held up his hands. "Whoa, whoa, easy there, big guy! I didn't mean any offense, don't get mad..."

Randol trailed off, as he noticed the tattoos covering Brazak's torso. An intricate stylized bear was inked over his heart in red, which wasn't surprising given the man's frequent reference to the bear spirit his clan honored, but surrounding this were other, equally intricate black tattoos depicting almost a dozen other woodland animals.

"Brazak not *mad."* The warrior said, absently, as he stepped past Randol, and squinted at the strange runes. "When Brazak feel *mad,* Brazak call on strength of mighty bear spirit. Right now, Brazak just feel...*confused."*

The red of the bear tattoo on the barbarian's chest faded to black, and at the same time, a black tattoo of a great horned owl near his clavicle turned a bold shade of crimson.

"And when I feel *confused*," Brazak continued, in a clipped, erudite accent that flawlessly enunciated each word, "I find that it is generally more efficacious to invoke the intellectual acumen of the *Wise Owl Spirit."*

"Wise Owl Spirit?" Kefira exclaimed.

Brazak glanced at her, and gave a slight nod. "Indeed, my good elf. Did you presume I had but a single arrow in my metaphorical quiver? *Really,* now! What sort of second-rate clan has only *one* primal spirit guide? Now then, let's see what we can deduce about these *fascinating* symbols, shall we?"

As the two other adventurers gaped in astonishment, Brazak withdrew a pair of delicate pince-nez spectacles from his belt pouch, clipped them onto the bridge of his nose, and leaned forward to begin examining the runes on the gate.
