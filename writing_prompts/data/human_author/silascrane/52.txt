Lying amid the pile of musty, discarded burlap sacks he'd fashioned into a bed, Rowan opened his eyes, and froze. He saw an old man old man in a dusty brown robe, tied at the waist with a broad leather belt that was laden with a dozen different leather pouches. The stranger loomed over Rowan, giving him an appraising look that reminded him of a hostler sizing up a horse at market. As that thought formed in his mind, Rowan's hand went involuntarily to his neck. There was no iron collar there, only the fading scar left by the one that had marked him as a slave, a year ago.

"Who are you? W-what do you want?" Rowan rasped sleepily, rubbing his eyes, and looking around the narrow alleyway in the slums where he'd made his pitiful encampment. A rickety old wagon hitched to a lopsided team of three equally rickety old draft horses blocked one end of the alley. A precarious stack of castoff wooden crates had blocked the other end for as long as Rowan could remember, which was why he'd chosen this particular alley to bed down in. A dead end meant far fewer people passing this way, and therefore far less chance of Rowan being beaten and robbed, or worse.

The old man's expression changed, abruptly. To Rowan's great surprise, his visitor swept his pointed brown hat off his head, and smiled, giving him a slight bow.

"Good day t'ye, sir!" the man said, with a voice that wavered with age, and a slight lilting accent. "Padraig the Peddler is I, and what I want is no more than to ply me trade."

Rowan sighed, feeling a strange mix of relief and disappointment. The man did not seem to mean him harm, but Rowan had little use for peddlers -- they were generally regarded as the least of merchants, eking out a living by selling simple necessaries to farmers in the countryside, and artisans and poor folk in the cities. Even their humble wares, however, were beyond what Rowan could afford.

"Peddler, huh?" Rowan grumbled, as he pulled himself up to a sitting position, groaning at the protest of his aching back. He felt at the cloth pouch around his neck, where he kept his coins, when he had any. He'd earned three coppers and a miserably sore back, for spending the previous day loading heavy sacks of grain onto a merchant's carts. He'd already spent two at the dingy tavern not far from the alley, on just barely enough watery ale to get him moderately drunk, and just barely enough food to keep the ale down.

"What have you got for one copper?" Rowan asked, drily, withdrawing his single coin from his pouch. The peddler probably did have a thing or two that cost that little, but most wouldn't want to waste time showing their wares to someone with so little to offer in return.

"For that?" the peddler said, gesturing to the coin, still smiling. The man reached into one of his many bulging pouches, and withdrew a thin pewter disk, about twice the size of the copper coin. It was stamped with the image of a laden packhorse led by a robed figure in a pointed hat. "I can offer this."

Rowan frowned, squinting at the odd little disk. "What is it?"

"Tis' the mark of a peddler's apprentice." Padraig explained, cheerfully. "By this token, I, as a Master Peddler, offer to take you under me wing, and teach you the peddler's trade."

His eyes widened in amazement. Starting an apprenticeship in a trade usually had to be paid for, as the cost of housing and feeding a young man who was new to his craft always exceeded the value of the work he could do, at first. Apprenticing to a successful smith, merchant, or woodcarver might cost as much as a full gold crown. The peddler's profession might be lowly, but Rowan would have thought even a peddler would ask a silver penny or two, for his trouble.

"Are...are you serious?" Rowan stammered.

Padraig smirked. "I never joke about doing business, boy."

Rowan licked his lips. He wanted to agree immediately. But hastily agreeing to terms was what had gotten him his collar. He'd learned better.

"What are your terms?" Rowan asked.

The peddler grinned. "Ah, you've a head for business, young man. The terms are simple: you're my apprentice, I'm your master. You work for me a year and a day for free, but I keep you well fed and cared for in the bargain, and will teach you my trade. After that, if you want, you can become a *senior apprentice,* and keep one penny in ten of whatever money you make for me."

"And...if I don't want?" Rowan asked, hesitantly. He didn't want to antagonize the man, but he needed to know what he was getting himself into.

Padraig shrugged, "Then you're free to go."

Rowan thought for a moment. Then he held out his copper coin, all the wealth he owned. "Deal. I'm Rowan Freeborn."

The peddler took the coin, and handed him the pewter token.  Rowan looked at the small disk in awe. It felt strangely heavy, and warm to the touch. The old man placed a hand on his shoulder. "Wise choice, young Freeborn -- you'll go far. And I don't only mean that literally."

The peddler spoke a few words Rowan couldn't understand. As he was about to ask what they meant, in the blink of an eye, Rowan became a horse.

He didn't resist, as the peddler led him to the wagon, and hitched him up alongside the rest of the horses. He was dimly aware that there was something awfully strange about this. But he was, after all, a horse, and pulling wagons was what horses usually did.

From there, his awareness faded to into a placid blur: walk, hay, oats, cool water, rest. Walk. He repeated this cycle many times, though the idea of counting was now just a fuzzy memory. Walk, hay, water, rest. Occasionally, a sweet, crunchy apple or carrot, or a few days in a row with no walking, provided a welcome respite. But even when he wasn't at such leisure, he found he didn't mind the work he was set to. 

Each day, he seemed to grow stronger, and the walking became easier. For the first time in his life, he felt content.

And then, he suddenly found himself standing naked in a stall in a stable. He came to his senses  so quickly that he lost his balance and fell over, crying out in alarm as he toppled backwards into the hay. In the corner of the stall, the peddler snorted and awoke with a start where he sat on a wooden tool.

"Ah!" the peddler said, smiling. "You're back. Congratulations -- you've served me well for a year and a day. I'm very pleased. Will you be staying on as a senior apprentice, then? Or have you decided yet?"

Rowan screamed. It seemed like the only appropriate response to this situation. The peddler rolled his eyes, and gestured to him. "Stop that, you'll wake the whole village." Rowan stopped -- he found that he *had* to stop.

"Answer the question." the peddler said firmly, his expression suddenly flat and hard.

Rowan looked around in bewilderment, trying to find something to ground him in reality, or set his mind into motion. He was terrified by whatever strange power the peddler possessed, that had turned him into an animal, with seemingly nothing more than a pewter disk and a few strange words. 

But at the same time, he retained his memory of his dream-like time as a beast. All things considered, the peddler had treated him better as a horse than he'd ever been treated, as a slave. And the benefit of regular meals and steady physical labor had apparently stayed with him when he returned to his natural form -- he felt more hale and strong than ever before.

Rowan also found that he desperately wanted to know more about this odd old man. Why would someone with such unbelievable power at his disposal spend his days travelling in an old wagon, selling trifles to farmwives and beggars? Who or *what* was he, really?

Even so, Rowan still surprised himself when he blurted out: "I...I think I'll stay on, if you'll have me, Master."

The peddler's smile returned. He swept back his cloak, revealing a bundle of clothing he'd been holding on his lap. He tossed it to Rowan who caught it awkwardly. "Good man! Get dressed, and then we'll go inside. Not right to sleep you in the stables, now that you're up on two legs again. Tomorrow, you'll come with me to make an important purchase, and get your first real lesson in doing business."

"What's that?" Rowan asked, eagerly, as he fumbled his way into the clothing; simple but clean work clothes that were, nonetheless, the finest he'd ever worn.

"A new horse for me wagon, of course." The peddler grinned, and added, "One that was *born* a horse, mind you. I find that I can only effectively train one *apprentice* at a time."
