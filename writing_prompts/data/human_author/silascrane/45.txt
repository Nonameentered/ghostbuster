At first, you lurch forward on all fours, awkwardly grasping at the ground with ungainly claws halfway between paws and hands. Then, as the transformation completes, your body reaches the perfect balance between man and beast, and you all but fly through the woods.

You need to hunt, but it is not prey that you seek, not yet. You instinctively know that something is missing, something vital. Then you hear it, distant but unmistakable: a howl. You run towards that sound, which soon becomes a baying chorus echoing through the forests. Once, that sound would have chilled you to the bone. Now, it welcomes you home.

Soon, you are running shoulder to shoulder with others like yourself, giving way only to the grizzled, white-muzzled Elder, and to his equally ancient mate. Father and Mother to the pack, these two will lead the hunt.

The Elder lifts his head to sniff the air, and you follow suit. The scent of man is strong on the wind, and the pack follows it. Deep inside, the part of you that is human recoils in horror, at the thought that fellow humans might be your prey.

Suddenly, you catch a sharper, fouler scent, mingling with the more familiar odors of mankind. Instinctively, you bare your fangs and snarl. Then you understand: the pack does not hunt humans.

The pack follows their scent, because it hunts the things that hunt them.
