Save one, or save five? That was the choice that faced me, as the engine hurtled down the track towards the junction controlled by the switch I'd been chained to.

The classic trolley problem.

I think that, contrary to popular belief, not pulling the switch is the only moral option -- neither the switch nor the oncoming diesel engine are my doing. I am morally culpable for one death if I choose the five over the one, but for none if I simply refuse to participate in my captor's sick game.

This, however, assumes a perfectly binary choice. And those, despite my tormentor's best efforts to create one, do not exist outside the realm of pure thought. 

Save one, and kill five, or save five by killing one. That's the choice my captor was selling. Well, *caveat venditor.*

I started to pull the switch.

And then I stopped, leaving the track misaligned. The train's breaks squealed in protest, far too late. My adversary operating the engine had not planned on stopping -- in the theoretical version of this scenario that he'd carefully planned, I would either pull the switch or not. 

The difference between theory and application appeared in the form of a tumbling hulk of metal belching fire and smoke, as the train derailed, veering sharply away from both of its anticipated trajectories. 

I wasn't sure that would happen. I wasn't sure the train wouldn't end up hitting me, or one or both of the targets when it detailed.

But I was sure that it was the one choice that, if I lived, I could live with.
