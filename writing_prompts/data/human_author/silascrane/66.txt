Police Chief Douglas took a sip from his coffee, as he sat in a folding chair next to the small guard post outside the massive hangar-like structure of the police department's secure impound facility.

Dixon, the officer in charge of the lot, asked him a question, which he didn't hear. With a sigh, he lifted one earcup of the protecting earmuffs he'd borrowed from the shooting range. He'd also brought a pair for Dixon, and motioned for him to do the same.

"Sorry sir," Officer Dixon said, chagrined, as he pulled one side of the earmuffs away from his head. "I just...is he really coming *here?"*

The Chief made an exasperated sound. Dixon had only been on the force a few months -- more experienced cops were used to dealing with metahumans, but Dixon was apparently starstruck by the prospect of the city's premiere hero showing up at impound.

"Yes, Dixon, that's what I *just said."* The Chief replied, sharply. "He called and said he'd arrested a supervillain, that he was bringing her here, and that we should bring earmuffs."

"If he's bringing someone in, should we have backup, or...?" Dixon began, hesitantly.

Chief Douglas waved him off. "Captain Phaeton said that---"  A massive shadow suddenly fell over them, and the Chief put his earmuffs back on, hastily gesturing for Dixon to do the same.

What appeared to be a high-tech battle tank the size of a city bus fell from the sky like a comet, slowing when it was 30 feet off the ground, and then descending the rest of the way at a leisurely pace.

Holding on to the tank by its turret, the long barrel of which had been mostly broken off, with the remnant bent into a pretzel-like twist, Captain Phaeton set it onto the ground. The Captain looked like an ordinary human -- except for the brightly colored cape and tights -- but the city's number-one hero was actually of alien origin. He hailed from the planet Phaeton, a world that shared Earth's orbit, but went around the sun at the same speed as Earth. It was always, therefore, on the other side of the sun, and hence always invisible to mankind.

As the superhero set the tank down, it became clear why he'd recommended the earmuffs. The tank's treads and drive wheels were smashed, obliging the Captain to push it across the pavement, resulting in a horrible screeching sound as he eased it into the impound hangar, causing metal to grind on the pavement as he carefully nudged it into place. Once it was fully inside, Captain Phaeton breathed a sigh of relief. Despite being purportedly invincible, he looked a bit banged up after what had presumably been a challenging encounter.

"What the hell is that?" Chief Douglas said, as he removed his earmuffs, and gestured to the wrecked tank. Dixon was close behind, eyes wide and staring at the superhuman legend.

"A criminal. I arrested her under the Superhuman Deputization Act, for reckless endangerment, wanton destruction of property, larceny..."  Captain Phaeton paused, frowning. "Didn't I say all that when I called in?"

"That's a tank!" the Chief protested.

"Not a tank! *The* tank!" shouted an amplified voice emanating from the massive vehicle. " Enjoy your momentary triumph, treadless fools! I will rise again, for I am *Tank Queen!"*

Captain Phaeton snapped his fingers. *"Tank Queen,* that's right."

The Chief stepped away, motioning for the Captain to follow him. In a lower voice, he said, "Captain...why the hell did you bring us *the giant-ass tank,* instead of breaking her out of it and just bringing *her*? I mean, we could have sent a *truck* for the wreckage."

The superhero cleared his throat. "Yeah, I wanted to talk to you in person about that, Chief. I really think you should leave her in there."

"Leave the megalomaniacal psychopath *in her tank?"* Douglas said, raising his eyebrows.

"She...prefers it in there." Captain Phaeton said.

"I'll bet she does!" Chief Douglas replied, incredulously. "It's way easier to commit murder and mayhem from inside a giant eff-off battle tank!"

The Captain shook his head, "No, no, it's fine. I smashed the engine, and the weapons. She can see and hear out of some external microphones and cameras, but that's about it."

"How can you be sure it's fully out of commission?" the Chief demanded. "What if it's got hidden weapons or some kind of secondary drive system?"

"I checked for that with my super-sonar, there's nothing like that." Phaeton said, holding up a hand in a placating gesture.

"Okay, let's say I accept that: but still, *why?"* the Chief asked.

Captain Phaeton sighed. "Listen...her real name is Mindy. Mindy *Hari."*

The Chief frowned, trying to place the name, then his eyebrows shot up. "Wait, like *Mata Hari?"*

The Captain nodded. "Her mother is the current *Mata Hari --* apparently 'Mata' is actually the *title* of the reigning matriarch of some weird matrilineal family of female spies and assassins. Her aunt, sister, and grandmother are all part of that femme fatale family tradition, too. I looked it up a while back, it's *really* pathological."

"But she's different?" the Chief prompted.

Captain Phaeton tilted his hand from side to side. "Well...not exactly. She's still evil, a megalomaniac, and overall, a danger to herself and others. But Tank Queen has rebelled against the whole sexy assassin thing, preferring to try and conquer the world the old fashioned way: with lots of explosives."

"So, again, why do we want this woman inside a high-tech murder machine?" Douglas asked.

"It's *safe,* I promise." The Captain assured him. "Look, I've seen her with my super-sonar -- it's kind of like a 4d sonogram, very detailed -- and she's *very* attractive. She may have *chosen* not to leverage her sexuality for villainy, but she definitely could.  If she gets pulled out of her tank, put in cuffs, and taken on a perp walk, no one will be talking about her big evil tank, or her mad spree of wanton destruction. It'll be all about how *beautiful* she is. It would be everything she's worked to get away from, in her life. And that would absolutely *crush* her. "

Douglas sighed, glancing at the young Officer Dixon, who just looked confused. "This is one of those superhero morality things, isn't it?"

Captain Phaeton nodded, soberly. "What makes a superhero different from our villainous counterparts is that we cause only the amount of pain that we *have to* in order to protect people." He gestured to the tank. "This thing was designed to be like an armored, lethal *RV.* There are even ports where it can hook it up to electric, water, and sewer lines, much like you would use for a motorhome -- I think she's already been living inside it, more or less 24/7. You can even give her meals through an intake port on the side -- it's too small for her to escape through, but plenty large enough to slip a tray through. It will accomplish the same thing as conventional imprisonment, and at less cost to the taxpayers, I'd wager."

Officer Dixon scratched his head. "Sir, and uh, Captain, beggin' your pardon, but I just don't see why she should get that kind of consideration, mental issues or not. "

"Mercy." Captain Phaeton said, simply.

"But why does *she* deserve mercy, Captain?" the young officer asked, still sounding confused.

The Captain shook his head. "That's what people don't understand about mercy, son. It's not about the worthiness of the person who receives it. It's about the worthiness of those who can find it in their hearts to give it. Even I don't always have the option of restraint, not when there are innocents to protect. But whenever I can, I choose mercy."

Dixon nodded slowly.

Chief Douglas frowned. "Well, we have a lot of leeway on how we can incarcerate super-criminals, especially given a superhero's specific recommendation. And the Captain here has earned a lot of trust, over the years. I'll trust his judgment on this."

Captain Phaeton smiled, "Thank you, Chief." He glanced at Dixon, and gave him a salute, which the officer eagerly returned.

Then, taking a few quick steps back out of the impound hangar, he launched himself into the sky.
