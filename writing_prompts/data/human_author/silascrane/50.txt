Captain Joshua Ephraim walked grimly down the passage leading to the flight deck of the Interstellar Frigate Utvandring, where the Commanders of the convoy vessels, as well as the Directors of each habitation module attached to them, had all been gathered to await his arrival.

There was no need to announce why he'd summoned the Commanders away from their own vessels. For days, hyperdrive efficiency had been dropping, their speed through the chaotic maelstrom of hyperspace slowing. They were due in Proxima tomorrow, but were still days away. 

No technical reason for this loss of efficiency could be found, which meant there was only one explanation: they had a stowaway. Not some surreptitious traveler from Deimos Station trying to join the Proxima Colony, but an Entity, a native of hyperspace hoping to ride the convoy back to the place that, prior to the discovery of hyperspace, humans had always simply thought of as "reality". 

As he neared the blast doors to the flight deck, two figures fell into step beside him. To his right was a tall, well built man: his XO, Commander Koira. On the left, his old science officer, Lt. Commander Cohen strode along awkwardly, as he adjusting knobs on the bulky apparatus he wore strapped to his chest.

"The Lorica will tell us what we need to know?" Captain Ephraim asked. 

Cohen nodded, somberly, as he carefully adjusted the dials on his chest mounted contraption, causing incandescent indicator lights to pulse and glow. Tech that had been reverse-engineered based on The Signal always seemed so strange and arcane, its designs harkening back to the late industrial age. They never could get it to play nice with contemporary technology. Signaltech was all heavy-gauge wire, bulky analog circuits, and vacuum tubes. It was odd, to be sure, but it was also what made safely traversing hyperspace possible.

As they passed through the blast doors, the assembled commanders and directors turned to face the captain's group, standing on the walkway before the blast doors, several feet above the deck itself. Captain Ephraim made a gesture to his science officer, and the man descended to the stares to the deck. He held a long copper rod connected by wires to his Lorica device, which he began passing over each Commander and Director as he walked by the on the deck, the indicator lights flashing gold as he did so.

Ephraim watched as the old man walked down the line of officers. He hoped Cohen was wrong. He hoped that there was some mistake, some other explanation. He hoped nobody  would be that foolish. 

As the lights on the Lorica suddenly blazed red, he knew he'd hoped in vain. The Director Cohen stood in front of, one of 16 module directors aboard the Colony Transport *Leo,* looked around in confusion as all eyes fell on him. Then he looked down at the glowing red lights on Cohen's Lorica, and his shoulders slumped.

Ephraim stomped down the stairs and crossed the deck in under a minute, bearing down on the cowering Director. 

"Explain yourself, Director..." he glanced at the name tag stitched on the man's jumpsuit. "Director Zerah."

 "I...there was a hypershift in my quarters." the man stammered.

Nearby, Lazenby, the Commander of the Leo, groaned.

"And?" Captain Ephraim demanded. He already knew the answer, but he wanted to hear it from the man's own lips. A hypershift was a rare side effect of hyper-transit, where a small amount of inorganic matter was exchanged with an equivalent amount of hypermatter, the native substance of hyperspace. If reported and properly contained, it was harmless -- indeed, it served as fuel for the reactors that powered the convoy. 

"I...I had an empty container. It was shielded, used for containing radioisotopes! I...I thought it would be good enough." Zerah stammered.

Lt. Commander Cohen shook his head, sadly. "No, Director. No lead shielding, nor any type of Faraday cage can properly shield hypermatter. Only Signaltech containment fields can insulate it from...from *them*."

The Captain glowered. "Have you been hearing them?"

Zerah wilted under his gaze, stammering and looking at the floor. The Captain grabbed the man's jumpsuit. "Have you?!"

Zerah nodded, miserably. 

Captain Ephraim sighed, heavily, releasing the director.

"I...I have debts!" Zerah pleaded, miserably. "And it was over a gram of hypermatter! Do you know what that's worth? I...I knew it was wrong, but--"

The Captain held up a hand, and Zerah fell silent. 

Commander Lazenby stepped up beside Zerah. "Sir, I take full responsibility for--"

"Enough." Captain Ephraim said, sharply. "This is on him. Accepting or assigning blame won't change what has to be done. Commander, you will return to the Leo, and order your crew to confine all personnel from this man's module to quarters. Once that's done, you will permanently lock down the blast doors leading into the module, and open the atmospheric seals to vent it into hyperspace. The module itself will have to be detached and destroyed at Proxima."

Lazenby's eyes widened in horror. "Everyone? The whole module?"

Zerah cried out. "No! N-not all of them have even heard the voices!"

"They will soon." Cohen said, sadly. "There's no way the contamination won't have spread to everyone who lives there, by now. We'll have to sweep the adjacent modules and common areas, as well."

Captain Ephraim's heart twisted in his chest, as he turned on his heel.  He called over his shoulder. "XO Koira, escort Commander Lazenby to Airlock A and prep a shuttle for him." Lazenby looked stunned, as Koira led him away.

Zerah cried out in alarm, as two security officers seized him by his arms. "Wait! What...what are you going to do with me?"

He paused, turning back. He ignored Zerah, instead addressing the officers. 

"Escort Director Zerah to Airlock B immediately." the Captain said, with a weary sigh. "He won't be needing a shuttle."
