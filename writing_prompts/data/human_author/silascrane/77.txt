"So, is the skull authentic?" Grogan asked, tensely. The gruff middle aged man was dressed like a construction worker, and wasn't afraid to get his hands dirty, based on the grime beneath his fingernails. Just looking at Ralph Grogan, you'd never know he was the president of a billion dollar development company.

He was seated across from me at the desk in my study, along with his personal assistant, a pretty young woman in a hard hat, tank top, and shorts that were clearly designed more to show off her shapely legs than to beat the heat doing manual labor, which judging by *her* pristine nails, was not something she engaged in often.

I glanced down at the ancient relic he'd brought, staring back up at me with its dark, hollow sockets. There was no mistaking it's provenance. It was a real human skull, and it was older than European colonization of the region. More importantly, it had been found on Grogan's construction site. 

"In my academic opinion?" I said. "Absolutely."

Grogan scowled. "We both know I ain't here for that, McCabe. I got archaeologists and lawyers on my payroll, already. I came here because you do...you know, that *other* thing."

"Most people don't know it, but Mr. Grogan is a very... spiritual person." his assistant piped up, brightly. Grogan shot her a look, but he didn't disagree.

"I been around a while. Seen some things." Grogan added, with a shrug.

I nodded, in understanding. "So, you feel you're in a good position *legally,* but you want to make sure your construction doesn't cause any problems in..." I gestured to the skull, "...other ways?"

He nodded, and I smiled.

"Well then," I said, ominously. "Let's ask our friend here how *he* feels about your project."

The room suddenly darkened -- that was because I'd quietly pressed a button under my desk that I'd had a contractor rig up, to dim the lights and close the blinds. The assistant squeaked in surprise, and even Grogan looked around nervously. I didn't say it was magic, but if they *assumed* it was, I couldn't help that.

I rolled my eyes back into my head, and spoke in a resonating voice. 

*Mortal remains, from thy tomb pulled free,*

*Hearken ye now, and speak unto me!*

Grogan and his employee both cringed back, the latter almost tumbling over backwards before Grogan caught her, as the skull's empty sockets filled with a wan blue light, and it rose a few inches into the air.

*Why do you call me back from the happy hunting ground, paleface medicine man?*

"This man here is a chief among...the, uh, palefaces." I explained, gesturing to Grogan, who cringed as it swiveled to face him. "He wishes to settle his people on the land where yours once dwelt."

The skull seemed to ponder this, then spoke again.

*My people are no more - all gone to happy hunting ground, many moons ago. Care well for the land that was ours, and we will have no quarrel with you, paleface chief.* 

Grogan nodded, emphatically, his eyes wide. He held up his hands in a conciliatory gesture.  "N-no problem there, chief! We got environmental impact reports, carbon offsets, green building materials -- all that crap, I swear! I'll even set aside a couple hundred acres for a nature preserve!"

The skull nodded sagely. 

*Then you may do as you will, paleface, but trouble me no more. I return to happy hunting ground.*

The light in the skull's eyes died, and it clattered back down into my desk. I pressed the button again, and the room brightened.

"Well," I said crisply, placing a hand atop the skull. "Looks like your project is in the clear, Mr. Grogan. I'll need to hang on to this, of course, so I can perform...the uh... appropriate *rites* to lay it to rest again." 

He held out his hands, as though to ward both the skull and myself away, and he and his assistant scrambled to get out of their chairs and away from my desk. "No problem, keep it! I'll send you your check by courier, I uh...I have another thing, I gotta run!"

Grogan and the girl very nearly did run, as they hastily exited my study. I had no doubt they'd  show themselves out quickly, so I sat back in my chair with a satisfied sigh.

As you've probably guessed, it was a scam. The skull wasn't that of an ancient Indian chief. In fact, Grogan's development wasn't anywhere near historic tribal lands.

Rather, having already learned of Grogan's superstitious streak, and established a name for myself as a medium, I'd snuck onto Grogan's construction site and planted the skull where I knew it would be found. Grogan might risk covering up the discovery of an ancient Indian burial ground to avoid the legal hassle, but based on what I'd learned about him, he wouldn't risk his new development being cursed or haunted.

The skull itself was actually mine -- not *my* actual skull, obviously, that would be silly. But I *owned* it, if anyone did. It was the skull of a distant ancestor of mine, and was something of a family heirloom. Any archaeologists would be able to tell that this skull predated local European settlement, but wouldn't suspect that was because it belonged to a man who was born centuries before his descendants brought his skull over from Scotland, in the late 1800s. 

But how did I make the skull float and talk? Well, that part was easy. 

"You know, it might have worked on Grogan and his mistress," I said to the skull, "But that 'Indian' voice of yours was *ridiculous,* Angus. Maybe a bit racist, too."

"Oh feck off wi' ye." Angus McCabe's skull said, swiveling around to face me. "I was born in 1308, ye daft prick, they hadnae *invented* any bloody racism yet. Back then, we only ken aboot two kinds o' people: proper Scotsmen, and wee *pissants* like you."

It was easy to make him talk and move around, you see, because he could *always* do that. *Convincing* him to play the role had been the hard part. My ancestor, like me, was a practitioner of magic. He thought wizards like us should be above using their powers to deceive people for money, as though we were common charlatans. I, on the other hand, had rent and student loans to worry about.I eventually brought him around -- it helped when I told him Grogan was of *English* heritage.
 
"I'm a McCabe, too." I protested, turning him to face the custom nameplate on my desk. *Andrew McCabe - Historian / Psychic Medium*

"Och, dinnae remind me," he said, mournfully. "How thin th' blood of McCabe has become!"

I smirked, rising from my desk, and stretching, as I headed for the door. "At least I still *have* blood, old man."

"Arsehole." he grumbled.
