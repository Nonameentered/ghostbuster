Amelia, the Butterfly Princess floated down from her circuit of the Bookworm Princess' palace tower, folding her colorful wings.

"All the windows are shuttered, there's no getting in that way!" she reported.

"But we have to get in!" Aurelia, the Rainbow Princess cried, leaning her head out from behind her armful of painting and carpentry supplies. "The Bookworm Princess' message said her palace is running out of room for *books!* We have to help her remodel!"

"It is our duty to help our sister Princess in her hour of need!" Helga, The Heart Princess declared, firmly. "And since she *asked* for our help, that's invitation enough for me!"

Helga raised her scepter high above her head. Its solid steel heart-shaped head made it as effective a mace as it was a scepter, and she seemed intent on breaking down the closed doors into the palace.

"No!" Aurelia cried, stepping in front of Helga. "She needs help with remodeling, not *demolition!"*

"Not that anyone bothered to ask *me,"* sighed Greta, the Cloud Princess. "But she never actually said either of those things. She just sent a message saying that she 'has an endless thirst for knowledge, and her palace is running out of room for books'."

"So?" Aurelia said. "The redecorating is *implied!"*

"Redecorating is *always* implied, with you." Helga said, impatiently.

"Now now," chided Sandy the Sugar Princess, holding up a freshly baked pie. "Lets not quarrel, Princesses! Who wants pie?"

Amelia looked around, confused. "Is that fresh? Where did you get it?"

Sandy shrugged.

With an impatient scoff, Bethany the Glamor Princess stalked past them all, her perfectly styled blonde curls bouncing as she walked. "Oh never mind all that -- *I'll* get the doors open."

Helga crossed her arms, regarding the other girl, skeptically. "What are you going to do -- *charm* them open?"

Bethany smirked, and then plucked a golden hairpin from her coiffure, and crouched before the doors. With a few quick twists, the doors were unlocked. Bethany pushed them open, then she stood and withdrew a pair of jewel-encrusted sunglasses from her purse, and slowly lowered them over her eyes.

"Nice glasses," Greta commented.

"Thanks!" the Glamor Princess said, brightly.

"Do they block UV rays, though? If they don't, you'll probably get cataracts and go blind, some day." Greta pointed out, glumly.

Bethany giggled, throwing an arm around Greta's shoulders. "I like you, Greta! You're *so* messed up!"

"Don't get too attached -- we may be young right now, but everyone dies." Greta advised.

"Alright, alright," Helga said impatiently, spreading her arms wide and moving forward to herd the other princesses into the palace. "Let's get inside and see what we can do to help."

As they entered the palace, the doors closed behind them, as if by magic. They were too absorbed in the sight that lay before them to notice, however: the Bookworm Princess, it seemed, had *not* been exaggerating.

The entry hall was literally filled with piles of books. If there were shelves, they were doubtless full as well, but any bookcases that might have been placed along the walls were concealed behind piles of disorganized tomes that reached to the ceiling.

"Hello, uh...Bookworm Princess?" Aurelia called, setting down her remodeling supplies on one of the few open patches of tile floor.

Sandy frowned, thoughtfully. "Actually, what's BP's *name?"* She held up a freshly baked layer cake. "I wanted to write it on this in icing, but come to think of it, I actually have no idea what it is..."

"Now where did you get *that?"* Helga demanded, staring at the cake in disbelief.

"Sandy's probably meddling with powers she doesn't comprehend, forces that will eventually exact a terrible price for the unholy abilities they've granted her." Greta suggested, flatly, then she swiped a finger tip over the frosting atop the cake and tasted it. "Hmm...buttercream. Yum."

"Someone's got to know it." Amelia said, chuckling. Then she looked around at her companions. "...right?"

Bethany shrugged. "Nah, couldn't tell ya."

"Names are just another social charade we use to delude ourselves into believing that we aren't ultimately alone." Greta opined. "And, um, I don't know what hers is."

"Me either." Aurelia admitted, furrowing her brow, thoughtfully.

Helga shook her head.

"Well..." Amelia began, uncertainly. "But we've *met* her, I'm sure we have. Right? We've *seen* her...haven't we?"

Suddenly, the floor beneath them began to rumble. They all turned towards the sound just in time to see a huge pile of books burst upward like an erupting volcano of tumbling volumes.

Surging up from the scattered codices, an immense segmented worm arose before them. It was as big around as an oak tree, and loomed above them twice as high as one. It opened it's mouth, which was split into four sharp scythe-like segments, and revealed row after row of razor-sharp teeth arranged in concentric circles around is gaping maw. It shrieked down at them unintelligibly, but at the same time, the princesses heard a baleful voice, implacable and vast, reverberating painfully through their skulls.

*My thirst for knowledge is ENDLESS...but that which is held in your pathetic brains will slake it for a short time.*

Greta looked at Bethany, who was busy staring mutely up at the creature in abject terror.

"Told you." said Greta.

The worm descended on the six royals, its mouth hinging open impossibly wide to swallow them all in one great gulp.

The last thing the Princesses noticed before its jaws closed around them was -- to their utter astonishment -- a tiny, intricate platinum tiara studded with sparkling pink diamonds, that somehow remained securely perched atop its monstrous head.
