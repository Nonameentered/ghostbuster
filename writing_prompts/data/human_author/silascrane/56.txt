"This stuff is frickin' *awful*." Gus said.

Dominic chuckled, as he put the mixture of herbs into a paper bag and set it on the counter in front of his customer, a burly construction worker. "Of course it is. From a *culinary* perspective, it's a hot mess."

"I don't know if I can drink this every day, man." he said, grimacing and peering into the little sample cup Dominic had given him.

Dominic raised an eyebrow. "Would you rather stroke out and die? Or die from any one of *dozens* of other adverse outcomes of your untreated hypertension?"

Gus paused. "Not gonna lie, I might take my chances, man. I mean, life's gotta be worth living, right? And this shit is *really* bad."

"Did I mention that *erectile dysfunction* is likely to set in from your high blood pressure, long before it actually kills you?"

Gus blinked. And then, he pinched his nose closed, and downed the rest of the tea in a single gulp, before grimacing and snatching the paper bag with the herbal mixture off the counter.

"Thanks, man." Gus said, slapping a wrinkled five dollar bill and few singles down on the counter. "I gotta get back to work, see ya later!"

"Come again." Dominic said, drily, as Gus quickly turned to leave.

Another customer slipped inside, just before the shop door swung closed behind the departing Gus. Dominic straightened, attentively, ready to greet his new customer. It was a young woman dressed in a black hoodie and torn black jeans, with long black hair and an abundance of mascara. Red flags went up immediately, but Dominic reminded himself not to  judge a book by its cover.

"How can I help you?" Dominic said, with a smile.

The girl looked around furtively, as she stepped up to the counter. Licking her lips, she took a deep breath, as though steadying herself before she spoke.

"I want to *curse* someone." she said, firmly.

Then again, he thought, books had covers for a reason.

Dominic sighed, "Look, I sell *herbs."*

She shrugged. "So? It's legal in this state now, anyway, right?"

He rolled his eyes. "*Herbs!* Plural!"

She gave him a secretive smile. "Oh! Right, I mean I know that's what you have to *tell* people..."

"Because it's true." Dominic interjected.

"It's *okay,"* she assured him. "Look."

She held up her hand, displaying a large pentacle tattoo on it.

Dominic just stared at her, silently.

"Do you know what this means?" she asked.

"That you're older than 18, but younger than 25."

Her eyes went wide. "That's right! How did you know?"

"Because, you're obviously old enough to legally get a big spooky tattoo right on your *freaking hand* without parental consent, but *not* old enough to have fully developed the parts of your brain that would tell you what a bad idea that is."

"It means I'm a witch!" she growled, then added, "Like you!"

"What?" Dominic exclaimed.

"Yeah!" she said, crossly, placing her hands on her hips. "I'm a sister of the Craft! So you can stop the act: I'm not one of the *normies.*"

"I don't exactly fit the *profile* of a witch..." Dominic began.

She waved her hand. "Oh, I don't mind that you're a guy, I know men can be witches, too. I mean, everyone in my coven always talks about witches being one with the Earth Goddess, but the *ancient* witches worshipped a Horned *God,* too."

"Right." Dominic said. "The *ancient witches.*"

She made a disgusted sound. "Look, cut the crap! I know you're not just some...*gardener!* My aunt came to you for help. She's always had headaches, and doctors couldn't do shit about it. But *you* gave her a potion, and now she hasn't had one since!"

"I remember that. I gave her an herbal infusion, not a 'potion.'"

"Whatever!" the girl scoffed. "Infusion, potion, same thing! You're trying to tell me that wasn't *magick?"*

He sighed. "I'm trying to tell you I made her an infusion of white willow bark--"

"One of the trees sacred to the Goddess!" the girl interrupted, pointing a finger at him accusingly.

"--and turmeric." Dominic finished, irritably. *"And,* I noticed that she kept applying chapstick."

"What does *that* have to do with anything?"

"Her lips were dry and cracked, even though it's been a mild summer, and the humidity is high. That made me suspect she was dehydrated. I also smelled alcohol on her breath, despite the fact that she was visiting my shop in the *middle of the day.* See where I'm going with this?"

She scoffed. "No way, a *doctor* definitely could have told her that."

"Your aunt...well, let's just say she has a *big* personality. But unlike her doctor, I suspect, I wasn't intimidated or put off by it. I very bluntly told her that if she wanted her headaches gone permanently, she had to stop drinking so much, and increase her water intake. That probably did more good than anything else, if she took my advice." Dominic explained. "The infusion I made for her, on the other hand, was basically just a natural anti-inflammatory.  Herbal *aspirin."*

"...seriously?"

"Seriously." Dominic confirmed.

She frowned, fidgeting awkwardly for a moment.

"Well, um, are there any *plants* that can--"

"There are *no plants* you can use to put a curse on someone!" Dominic snapped.

"Ugh, fine!" the girl fumed. She flipped him off, and stormed out of the shop.
