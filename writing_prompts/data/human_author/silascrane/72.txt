"Good evening." The Chexecutioner said, pleasantly.

"Just get it over with." The horse thief grumbled. He knelt before the Chexecution Engine, placing his own head into the iron restraining collar.

The Chexecutioner chortled good-naturedly, as he fastened down the collar on the condemned absconder of equines. "Oh, I don't think you want me to do that. It is, after all, only *fifty-eight minutes past eleven,* which means it's not quite tomorrow. Seeing as how last night's unfortunate volunteer already decisively determined that today was not to be *Deathless Day* by being decapitated by the Chexecution Engine at the stroke of midnight, I think it's best we wait the remaining minute and a half -- don't you?"

"Whatever." the thief sighed.

"I must say, you seem rather morose about the whole thing." The Chexecutioner commented.

"Well, my head will probably be chopped off by this decapitation machine I'm bolted into, in a minute." the prisoner explained.

Just then, the king's chancellor rushed into the Chexecution Chamber. 

"Am I too late?" The chancellor asked, breathlessly.

"No, I'm still alive!" The horse thief said, hopefully.

"Oh, good!" The chancellor sighed, mopping his brow. "I have to witness every Chexecution, you know -- that way if it *is* the day, I can start passing along orders so we don't waste any of it."
 
The horse thief sighed.

Chexecution was the daily check to see if the current day was Deathless Day, the ever-shifting date where, for unknown reasons, death itself ceased to function in the kingdom, once per calendar year. 

Prisoners condemned to either long stretches of time in the dungeon, or sometimes even conventional execution, were permitted to volunteer to *check* if it was Deathless Day, beginning on the first day of each year, and lasting until the current year's Deathless Day was discovered. 

They did this "check" by having their head put into the Chexecution Engine, the nearly infallible precision-engineered decapitation machine built for this exact purpose. The lever was then pulled at midnight, which normally simply "executed" the prisoner, giving rise to the machine and its operator's inappropriately whimsical names. 

If your head was locked into the Engine, and its operating lever was pulled, there was essentially no chance that your head would not be removed -- unless of course, it *was* Deathless Day, in which case the machine would miraculously fail to execute you, and all your past crimes would be automatically pardoned, in recognition of your service to the kingdom.

Aware of all this, the thief closed his eyes, to wait out what would, most probably, be his last minute of life.
It was both an eternity and not nearly long enough, before the bell tolled midnight.

A split second later, he heard the ratcheting of the lever.

A split second after *that, * he found that he was still alive.

"Huzzah!" the prisoner cried. "It *is* Deathless Day!"

"I didn't see the blades engage..." The chancellor said, suspiciously.

"Yeah, bloody thing's jammed again, hold on..." The Chexecutioner grumbled, picking up a wrench, and opening a panel on the side of the engine.

"What?!" the thief cried. "It's supposed to be infallible!"

"Nigh infallible." the chancellor corrected.

The Chexecutioner closed the panel, and shook his head. "Nah, the blades jammed -- works got all gummed up with bits of the last guy, looks like. We'll need a mechanic."

The chancellor scoffed. "That could take an hour or more! Can't you fix it?"

The Chexecutioner shook his head. "Me? I can pull the lever and see if it's gunked up, but I'm no *mechanic."*

"Then why do you have a--" the chancellor began, but then cut off as the Chexecutioner gripped the heavy wrench in both hands, raised it high above his head, and brought it down on the prisoner's head with enough force to make the metal ring.

The horse thief's head slumped forward, as the chancellor looked on in horror.

The Chexecutioner waited a moment, then cleared his throat. "Well, looks like today's not--"

"Guess what day it is, bitches?!" the horse thief suddenly crowed, raising his should-have-been-caved-in head.

Then the three men, in unison, belted out a hearty "Huzzah!"
