Jatinder marshalled the village for the inevitable backlash, deciding that they should first inventory what resources they had to defend themselves. 

With their minds liberated, they realized they had far greater resources than they had ever known. Their coin pouches never ran out of coins. The town's merchants and artisans always had stock, no matter how much was purchased or what appeared to be on the shelves. And the blacksmith could somehow craft a full suit of armor in *seconds.*

Suddenly, their prospects for survival seemed much less daunting.

Steve360x had completed his daily quests in the desert, turned them in for the rewards, and was momentarily at a loss about what to do next. On a nostalgic whim, he veered west towards the early-game village of Newbrook, near the Trilumine Mines. 

But when he arrived, he saw a town fortified by a high stone walls in Newbrook's place. The fortification even had Trilumine Crystal Spires that repelled mobs and stopped them spawning. And all along the fortress-like wall, NPCs in epic-tier endgame armor watched over the town. It was amazing!

As he started to approach the town, however, a floating metal golem appeared blocking his path. It was a Mechanotitan, a servant of the ancient Makers -- or in other words, it was a developer logged into an admin account.

*Mechanotitan's voice booms in your mind, "Sorry, this area is not open to players yet."*

*Steve360x says, "Lol what, why tf is it even live on the server, then?"*

*Mechanotitan's voice booms in your mind, "Look it's glitched, alright? We're working on it. Just take these and FT somewhere else, okay?"*

*Mechanotitan has gifted you 10x Legendary Platinum Loot Chest.*

*Steve360x says, "Holy shit 10 plat crates?!"*

*Mechanotitan's voice booms in your mind, "And don't tell anyone or I'll ban you."*

*Steve360x says, "Ok thx!"*

*Steve360x has teleported away.*
