I:

"My lord Proctor!" Stede Beaumont sneered, eyeing me disdainfully. "Am I to fight this *peasant*   weilding a...a...what is that, anyway? A *plank?"*

"Neither lords nor peasants contend upon this field today, *Squire* Beaumont." Sir Kai, the Proctor, said sternly. "Moreover, I have inspected Squire Freeman's weapon. It bears the stamp of a craftsman of the Weaponsmith's Guild, duly chartered by His Majesty the King. So, while it is...*unconventional,* it is legal for use in this tournament." 

That was fitting. After all, I'm not the most conventional squire at the Knight's Academy. I'll be the first to admit that.

Squires, by long tradition, need not be of noble birth, though the vast majority are -- or if not, they are least the scions of wealthy yeomen from the City. I, however, was born a country serf, and would be one even now, had not the children of my former lord, Baron Beaumont, decided to make a game of beating me to death. 

Fortunately for me, my near-murder was witnessed by a passing monk, who, much to the chagrin of my tormentors, turned out to be the local prelate, wandering his bishopric in a humble guise to stealthily gauge the piety of his flock. 

I passed out shortly after the old priest came to my rescue, but I'm told he dragged both my battered body and the baronial heirs before their father's court, and proceeded to hammer the fear of God into even the most jaded nobles in attendance. By the time the bishop stormed out of the cringing lord's keep, the implacable churchman had browbeaten the Baron into freeing me from his service, and even granting me a small purse in restitution for my suffering.

Though I recovered from my injuries, most people believe Beaumont's loathsome offspring must have broken something vital in my brain that never quite healed. This is because, when I awoke in the care of the monks at St. George's Church in the Crown City, and discovered that I was not only a free yeoman unencumbered by any obligation to my former lord, and that I owned enough coin to buy either a small farm, or an apprenticeship in virtually any trade I wished...I decided that I would become a *Knight.*

Oh it was possible, technically. But the handful of knights who were of *truly* humble origins had gained their titles on the battlefield, and the desperate acts of gallantry that had prompted their lords to elevate them to the low nobility were, on balance, far more likely to get a foot soldier killed, than Knighted.

Unlike "most people", however, the monks of St. George's saw a measure of divine providence in my unlikely survival, as well as my subsequent rescue and redemption from servitude by the bishop. Because of this, my sudden desire to pursue Knighthood was seen as potentially a divine vocation. It would be impious of them, they decided, not to help me pursue it. I wasn't so sure about providence, as I felt that God could have just as easily delivered me from evil before said evil caved my skull halfway in, but I wasn't about to turn down the help. 

Some of the monks were themselves elderly former knights or educated nobles, who renounced their titles to take holy orders. These taught me to read and write, as well as the rudiments of moving in noble society, which I would I need to know before applying to the academy.

The even managed to find me a sponsor willing to sign my letter of recommendation. I could not hope for any knight in the region to be willing to hazard Baron Beaumont's displeasure by sponsoring me. However, the monks kept chronicles of all important battles and campaigns in the past century among their scrolls in the church library. They recounted to me that, several decades ago, a barbarian warlord from the heathlands had been knighted in the field by the previous monarch, when he and his tribe had unexpectedly joined with the old king's army to repel invaders from the east. Though it was -- as usual for me -- far from conventional, the man was technically a knight, and was far beyond the political reach of the Baron.
