DISPATCH: 911, what's your emergency?"

CALLER: M-my nephew, he's...he's sick! He's going crazy! I-I'm a registered nurse, but I've never seen anything like it! I need help!

DISPATCH: Alright, ma'am, where are you?

CALLER: \[REDACTED\]

DISPATCH: Alright, help is on the way: what are his symptoms?

(Loud banging is heard in the background)

UNKNOWN: *Kusobaba!* 

CALLER: Oh God, he's right outside the door! I think I really made him mad!

DISPATCH: We'll send a squad car along with the paramedics -- ma'am, please, try to stay calm -- what are your nephew's symptoms? Is he having some kind of seizure?

CALLER: I don't know! There's...it looks like a sudden involuntary contracture of the orofacial muscles, coupled acute ocular inflammation!

DISPATCH:  Ma'am, we just need to know in layman's terms--

CALLER: His mouth got really small, and his eyes have gotten ENORMOUS!

DISPATCH: What other symptoms?

CALLER: Agitation, uh...and xenoglossia!

DISPATCH: Xenoglossia? Ma'am, again, please just layman's--

CALLER: He's speaking....I think it's Japanese, alright?  Please hurry!
