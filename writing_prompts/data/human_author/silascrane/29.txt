It was closing time at Green Cheese Bistro, the little restaurant on the seedy side of Pegasi Station where Chef Herman Cruz plied his trade. He was already wiping down the counter, pausing occasionally to glance at his staff clearing away the leavings of the evening's last few customers, when the Omnorite strolled in through the still-open doors.

At over 12 feet tall, the burly alien had to bend at the waist to fit in the human-scale establishment, despite the Bistro's relatively high ceiling. Herman took particular note of the alien's expensive oversuit, and his artfully notched sail-like ears. He knew that, in the blistering heat of their home planet, Omnorites used their enormous ears like fans to cool off the youngest and most vulnerable members of their large herd-families.

Notching one's ears, so that they'd no longer work for that purpose, sent a very particular message, in their culture. Cindy, the Bistro's hostess, timidly approached the huge alien as he entered.

"I'm sorry sir..." Cindy began, uncertainly. "But we've just cl--"

"It's alright, Cindy." Herman called. "I'll serve this gentleman myself. Please show him to the size 4 table."

The young hostess was taken aback -- Herman was normally quite strict about not seating any customers after posted business hours. He valued his time after hours, much of which he spent back in the kitchen, perfecting his recipes. Nonetheless, she quickly recovered, and seated the unexpected guest at the single gigantic table the Bistro kept for its rare Omnorite --- and similarly sized -- patrons, equipped with stairs from the floor to the tabletop, to allow the human wait staff to service it.

Once the alien was seated, Cindy hurried back to the counter.

"You're making an exception to closing at 6 on the dot?" she whispered to Herman, raising her eyebrow. She glanced back at the Omnorite, who was peering bemusedly at the old-style printed menu he held between two digits. "Is this guy important or something? Like..." her eyes widened. "Is he a food critic from Inner Systems?"

Herman smiled secretively. "Let's just say he's important enough, Cin. Look, I'll take it from here -- you and the rest of the staff can take off, alright?"

His hostess frowned. "You sure, boss? Omnorites have pretty big appetites -- that's not racist, it's just basic xenobiology."

Herman chuckled. "I'll be fine. Go on -- you're off the clock."

So, reluctantly, Cindy gathered up the staff, and left Herman to contend with his colossal patron solo. For his part, Herman set to work immediately. He cracked two eggs onto the dark , slick surface of quartz-composite griddle, then laid out two strips of bacon beside them. With a few short taps on a hand control, he sent a series of short infrared pulses into the bacon and eggs until they were cooked to perfection. Most chefs left such things to a culinary AI, but Herman liked to do things the old fashioned way.

Plating the food, he swept out from behind the counter, across the floor, and up the stairs to the Omnorite's tabletop.

"Good evening, sir." he said, setting down the plate before the Omnorite with a smile. The Omnorite snorted. Omnorites made a variety of snorting and honking sounds that conveyed the emotional subtleties of their language, much as facial expressions and body language do for humans. Herman wasn't good at deciphering these, but he'd found that generally, his skills spoke for themselves.

"They say humans are the best cooks in the galaxy." the Omnorite said, at last. "You, in particular."

Herman shrugged modestly. "So they say."

"To be frank," the alien added, "I don't see much sense in this human preoccupation with making things manually. Oh, you have those nimble little hands, and you can do some surprisingly intricate work with them, that most sentients would need mechanized assistance to accomplish. I'll give you that. But at the end of the cycle, what can *you* do that a good synthesizer can't?"

Herman chuckled. "A fair question. Well, my friend, I see my profession as an *art*. It is not merely a mix of ingredients mechanically combined into a homogenous whole -- you could, indeed, get that from a synthesizer. What I offer is a unique experience that arises from the interplay of ingredients, their ratios and combinations improvised and creatively blended in the moment, while *my art* is being made. I find the results to be superior to anything a synthesizer  can put out. And my customers seem to agree."

"Your *human* customers?" the Omnorite asked.

"All my customers. Humans. Bexans. Omnorites like yourself." Herman corrected, with a shrug.

The Omnorite snorted again, and even Herman could hear the skepticism in it.

"Is that so?" the Omnorite rumbled. He gestured to the plate of bacon and eggs. "Well? I'm waiting."

Herman glanced at the plate, and then slapped his forehead. "Ah! Silly me -- I forgot *the seasoning."*

Herman reached into his pocket and withdrew a small vial, from which he emptied a small quantity of iridescent crystals onto the plate, beside the cooling bacon and eggs.

"Bon appetit." Herman said, gesturing to the crystals.

Without further prompting, the notch-eared Omnorite bent over the plate, placing his broad protruding snout over the iridescent grains, and sucked them up his nose. He straightened, seemingly unimpressed, but a second later the alien's small round eyes went wide, and his diamond-shaped pupils constricted to pinpricks. The Omnorite made an exuberant honking sound, slapping the table repeatedly, hard enough to make the Bistro itself shudder.

"WATER, SHADE, AND GUIDING STARS!" The Omnorite bellowed, before gasping and pausing to catch his breath, his notched ears twitching spasmodically. Herman smirked, pleased at his customer's reaction. He called the crystals *Twolev* \-- short for, 2-levo-hexamphetamine, a powerful psychostimulant he'd carefully compounded to be compatible with alien biology.

"By all the eldest gods..." the Omnorite sputtered in amazement, as he finally recovered the ability to speak. The huge alien reached into his pocket, withdrew a huge fistful of high-value cryptocred chips, and slapped them down onto the table with a clatter. "I'll buy all you have! Gods and demons alike, y-you humans really *are* the greatest cooks in the galaxy!"

Herman folded his arms, and flashed the alien drug dealer a grin. "You're *gods-damned* right we are."
