"It's beautiful, sir." I said, as I looked through the observation window at the Void. It was a Void in name, but it wasn't only emptiness. There was *something* there. Hints of light and color. A sense of rhythmic sound, despite the fact that the Void, like space, was supposed to be a vacuum.

Old Captain Reyes nodded, his gnarled hands clasped behind him.

"Yes." he agreed. "It always has been. Every time since the first."

I was so entranced by the Void, that I almost missed the significance of the what the captain said. He had been on one of the first experimental human voidships.

"What was different the first time, sir?" I asked, tearing my gaze away from the void to face him.

The Captain sighed. "Do you know what aliens see, when they look into the Void?"

I shrugged. "Nothing, sir. Non-human Voidships don't have windows."

He nodded. "But why is that?"

I thought back. Xenology 101 had been a long time ago. "Isn't it...some kind of alien superstition? That looking into the void will make you go mad?"

Reyes shook his head. "No. Not a superstition. If non-humans look into the void, they *will* go mad."

I furrowed my brow. "But...why, sir??" I looked back out at the gentle, subtle symphony of colors. "Most aren't all that dissimilar from us, cognitively. What is it about *this,* that disturbs their minds so much?"

Reyes shook his head. "You're asking the wrong questions, son. Think about it: why is it called the Void, when you can plainly see it's *not empty?"*

"Well...because when the first automated drone ships were sent through to test the Void drives, that was what the cameras saw. Nothing." I replied. "Only organic sentient beings seem to perceive anything in the Void."

"Do you know what that is?"

"No one does, as far as I know, sir. There are theories -- some kind of as-yet undetectable radiation that interacts with electrical impulses in the brain at a quantum level, maybe?" I said, struggling to remember what I'd learned at the academy about Void theory.

"Could be. But many species have brains that work similarly to ours. Why are we the *only* ones not effected this way?"

"I..." I paused. Now that I stopped to think about it, it really didn't make sense.

Reyes sighed. "It's because we don't see what they see. Not anymore."

"Anymore, sir?" I asked.

Reyes looked out the viewport, calmly. "That first trip through? It was like a waking nightmare."

That took me aback. Official reports had never mentioned anything like that.

"Sir?"

"There was...*something* in the Void. Something hungry, or maybe curious. It's hard to say. I think that, perhaps, for the thing -- or *thing*s -- in the Void, there's no difference between the two. We could feel them, as much as see them: endless talons clawing at us, endless mouths salivating, endless eyes staring deep into our minds and souls." the Captain said, hollowly. "It was only for a few minutes, but those minutes were spent in hell, and they *felt* like an eternity. No wonder it makes them all go mad."

"But...you recovered, sir?" I asked, hesitantly.

The Captain nodded, slowly. "More or less. No one believed us, of course. All the instruments were normal, and none of the recording devices captured what we experienced. They just saw us panicking and screaming while staring at nothing. So, they kept sending test crews, and none of them had the same experience we did, either. It was written off as some kind of undetected, transient failure in life support -- a bad air mixture in the ship's atmosphere, making us hallucinate. Then, when the  'lights and colors' were discovered, they also hypothesized that maybe there was some rare, fluctuation in whatever radiation causes them, that made us have a more...*intense* experience with the Void than normal, that day. When members of my team finally went back to testing Void drives, we never experienced it again, either."

I frowned, thoughtfully. "What about the other species who use Void drives?"

"It still happens to them, as far as I've been able to find out," the Captain replied. "They never look into the Void on purpose, but there have been some malfunctions and hull breaches in transit that have caused them to experience the Void, even in recent years. It still drives them insane, just like it almost did to me and my first crew."

"So, why doesn't it happen to human vessels, anymore?"

The old man gave me a wan smile. "Because of how our encounter with the Void ended. The claws of the Void tore us open, son. They bared our minds, our *souls.* We all felt it --- those eyes, or mouths, or whatever you want to call them, taking in our naked consciousness, eager to experience us, to devour us."

My eyes went wide. "What happened then?"

"They gazed on the deepest, most fundamental reality of what a human is. They felt us, tasted us, *understood* us, better than we understand ourselves." the Captain said, solemnly. "And then...they *ran.* Their insatiable, ravenous curiosity that we had felt from them vanished in an instant, and the vast and inscrutable beings that are seen as omnipotent horrors by a thousand species across the galaxy...fled from us in mortal terror. These entities continue to pry at the seams of every alien vessel that passes through the Void. But they have never again approached a human ship.*"*

I was rendered speechless, staring out into the Void, watching the calming, benign lights and colors go by outside the viewport.

"When I was young, the knowledge we were terrifying to the denizens of the Void inspired a certain...bravado." the Captain said, drily. "But now, I wonder..."

He trailed off, and we were both silent for a long moment, as we watched the Void together. Then, finally, he finished.

"...what monster is hiding in the heart of man, that terrifies even the abyss?"
