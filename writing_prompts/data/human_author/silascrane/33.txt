II:

So, after two days riding in a donkey cart to the heathlands, I arrived at the rustic village governed by one Sir Bjorn Frostulfr, and gained an audience with the hoary old barbarian chieftain. 

Between his rudimentary knowledge of my tongue, and a few phrases of Bjorn's guttural language I had learned from the monks, I managed to explain to him that I wished to become a great warrior like him, but that, among my people, my ability to do so rested on his approval.

Nodding solemnly, he rose from his fur-draped throne, walked up to me, and headbutted me three times in rapid succession.

 I staggered back sputtering, my eyes blinded by blood and tears, but I kept my feet.  As my vision cleared, I saw Bjorn grinning at me fiercely. He'd split open the skin on his deeply lined forehead in the process of slamming it into my face, and his own blood mingled with mine upon his shaggy-haired countenance. Before I could say anything else, the mad old savage threw back his head and laughed. 

"Ha! You have hard skull, boy! *Warrior's* skull!"

After this, I loaned him a quill, and he readily signed my letter of recommendation with a surprisingly neat and legible series of angular runes -- though he used the blood still trickling down his hairy cheeks, in place of the ink I'd provided. This accomplished, he gave me an avuncular slap on the back, and sent me on my way.

Once I returned to Crown City, I was at last able to apply to the Academy, which, after verifying that I had enough coin for my tuition, as well as authenticating Sir Bjorn's unusual pedigree with the chroniclers at St. George's, had little choice but to accept me.  
I had little money left, after all this, but the Academy provides arms and armor for its students to train in, as part of its tutelage.

Except for the optional Quarterly Tourney, as I learned to my chagrin only after I'd signed up for the event. In such public competitions, the young squires were required to provide their own equipment. It would be a dishonor to withdraw, but I could hardly compete in my shirtsleeves. 

Fortunately, my friend and fellow Academy Squire, Roald, agreed to loan me a suit of his armor, and old but serviceable set of plate that had been bequeathed to him personally by his late uncle. He could not, alas, offer me a blade, as all the swords he owned technically belonged to his noble family, and his father would never allow it. 

So, I scraped together what little coin I had, and went to the cheapest Guild smith I could find. I was dismayed to discover that I didn't have nearly enough for a good sword, nor even a decent mace. 

There was, it turned out, only one weapon in the smith's stocks that I could afford. The piece had been one of several commissioned for the City Guard a few years back, when they'd been about the business of raiding a multitude of thief and bandit dens throughout the region. This particular one had never been claimed, and was now thought to be of little value. 

It happened that I had just enough money to purchase the forgotten instrument of justice, and that was how I came to be wielding this unconventional weapon, as I faced off against my first opponent of the tournament, chosen by drawing lots. By chance, my lot fell on that of Stede Beaumont, son of Baron Beaumont -- one of the cruel lordlings who'd once beaten me to a pulp.

Stede's protest regarding my weapon and my breeding having been summarily dismissed by Sir Kai, the young lordling drew his sword, and stalked towards me with a hateful glare and confident sneer. I waited for him to close the distance. Only when he drew back to strike, did I raise my own weapon. 

Quickly, I lifted my gauntleted hands from atop it, where they'd concealed the cast iron fitting atop my weapon: a heavy hunk of metal cast in the image of a ram with spiralling horns.

Stede had called it a plank, but that was because he only saw it head on, and didn't realize how thick it was. If anything, it was more like a beam. In flash, I seized the iron handles on the back of the weapon, leveled it horizontally, and drew it back. Stede realized what I was holding and faltered, but he was too late to withdraw. I drove my weapon forward.

Stede went flying through the air as I slammed the City Guard's *hand-held battering ram* into his breastplate. He landed hard on the ground, wheezing, and clawing at his armor. The ram had been made to cave in the stout portals of bandit strongholds with a few swift strikes -- Stede's lightweight dueling plate was no match, and what's more, he now couldn't breathe properly, with his breastplate sharply dented inward by my strike. Lowering the ram, I glanced at the Proctor.

Sir Kai nodded, and I could have sworn he had a slight smirk as he announced that Stede was unable to continue, and motioned for attendants to help him out of his stoved-in plate, before formally naming me the victor. 

The monks at St. George's, it occurred to me, might just have been right, after all -- because, as I watched my former tormentor being carried off the field, still dazed and confused by his upset defeat, I felt suddenly confident that there was, in fact, a God.
