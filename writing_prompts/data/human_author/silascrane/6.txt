Captain Parker stared down at the prison facility hidden among the trees. It was rustic, to say the least. It looked like more like a frontier fort transplanted from the American frontier than a maximum security prison, with its earthwork wall topped by a log palisade.

Parker glanced at Agent Dobbs standing beside him, dressed in her black tracksuit with a pullover top. Despite the casual attire, the dark-haired, sharp-faced woman didn't look at all relaxed. But, then spooks never did. 

Parker was similarly dressed, having shed his uniform in favor of PT sweats and slip-on shoes supplied by the UN MPs guarding the outer perimeter a mile back -- all part of the special security protocols for the prison, apparently.

"What is this? A converted tourist attraction?"

Dobbs didn't spare him a look, as they continued forward towards the anachronistic fortress. "It's a black site."

Parker frowned, his mind drifting back to past operations. A lifetime of bad memories flickered through his thoughts, before he quickly pushed them into the back of his mind. "I've seen plenty of black sites before. They tend to be less conspicuous."

"It's necessary." Dobbs said, simply. "You know what Zero-Six can do."

Parker nodded, thoughtfully. Zero-Six was the subject of his mission. The man had been the world's most accomplished hacker and cyber-criminal, known by his alias "Phystek".  He'd always managing to stay one step ahead of Interpol and the UN Government, and his eventual capture had been more luck than anything. When he was finally taken, the UN Security Forces had been shocked to discover that he had no electronic devices on his person. He didn't need them.

Phystek was what the UNSF called a Zero, a human with paranormal abilities, and his powers allowed him to control machines within a limited range, using only his mind. It made sense that they'd want to keep technology well away from him, but going back to the old west in the construction of his prison still seemed like overkill to Parker. In any case, the UNSF needed Phystek now, and that was why they'd sent Parker.

As they reached the gates, Dobbs motioned to the detachment of  burly MPs that had been trailing them. The eight well-muscled men strode forward, and seized handholds carved into the gate.

"One! Two! Three! Lift!" barked the lead MP. The men heaved as one, raising the massive gate a few inches with grunts of exertion, then walked it a few feet to the side before setting it down with a thump.

"Seriously?" Parked asked, with a raised eyebrow.

"His powers have been growing. Eight months after we caught him, he managed to gain control of the mechanical locks on the doors of his original prison. When we first moved him here, these gates were set in a track atop steel rollers, with simple geared bolts to hold them in place from the outside. Last month, a guard saw one of the gears on the lock start moving by itself." Dobbs recounted. "Now all of the barriers flush in the tracks, and are manually lifted or lowered by a team of guards physically carrying them. We don't know if his powers could eventually extend to a machine as simple as a lever or wheel, and we don't want to find out."

"Shit." Parker muttered. "Well, at least he's motivated to get out of here."

"Don't underestimate him, Parker." Dobbs warned, as they paused so the MPs could heave open another massive door.  "He's physically unimpressive, but he's smart. Don't let him get in your head. The UNSF is counting on you. The *world* is counting on you."

Parker raised an eyebrow. "Odd choice of words."

"You know what I mean." she snapped.

A few minutes later, Parker found himself alone with Phystek in his cell. Dobbs certainly hadn't lied about his physical condition. The man looked gaunt and ragged, and dark bruises showed on his narrow, pale face. Parker scowled. He clearly hadn't been the UNSF's first choice for someone to *convince* Phystek to help them.

"So," the prisoner rasped, without turning to look at him. "What can *you* do, Zero?"

Parker paused. How had the man known? That ability wasn't in his file. After hesitating a moment, Parker decided to be honest. It usually made things easier, in the long run.

"I'm a telepath." Parker said, simply. "I have a limited ability to read others' thoughts...and a more substantial ability to influence them."

Phystek turned, eyeing him with an air of resignation. "So...that's how it is. They couldn't make me give them what they want, so they found someone who can take it. "

"It doesn't have to be that way," Parker said. "If you cooperate with the UNSF--"

Phystek snorted. "Cooperate with the wolves to keep the bear at bay?"

Parker scowled. "The fate of the world is at stake!"

The prisoner sneered. "Yes, yes. They've told me the story. Rogue AIs, out of control machines laying waste to the Eastern Hemisphere, and making more of themselves all the time. The monsters *they* created, now turning on their masters."

"It's true." Parker said. "I've seen the devastation myself, and it's only getting worse. Do you hate the UNSF so much that you'd let humanity die with it?"

"What humanity?" Phystek snarled. He gestured to his battered face. "Is *this* humanity?"

Parker inhaled deeply. It wasn't the first time he'd seen the example of the lengths the UNSF was willing to go to maintain order. "I...don't approve of methods like that. It's part of why I do what I do. I provide an alternative."

Phystek shook his head, sadly, and gave a bitter chuckle. "So naive. Tell me, soldier, do you know why I haven't agreed to help your masters?"

"You hate the UNSF. Maybe not without reason, but--"

"No!" the man snapped, angrily. "I haven't refused out of spite! I've refused because I know something they don't realize I know. Something that, despite my potential value to them, they would have killed me for knowing, if they did realize."

"Oh? And what's that?" Parker demanded.

Phystek gave him a wan smile. "Curious, are we? Well, I suppose I might as well tell you. You don't seem to be like the rest, and if even if it turns out that you are, well, I don't exactly have a lot to live for."

The prisoner spread his arms. "You say you can read my mind? Go ahead. I won't fight you."

Parker cocked an eyebrow. He hadn't expected that. Reading minds was usually trickier than influencing them, especially when it came to an unwilling subject. Still, it couldn't hurt to take a look. He extended his awareness to encompass the other man's mind.

A moment later, he recoiled, gasping, as Phystek did the same.

"My God..." Parker whispered.

Phystek doubled over, hands on his knees, but quickly caught his breath. 

"Now...you see?" he panted.

"The AIs..." Parker said, hollowly. "...when they first started killing people and destroying cities...they were still under UN control."

Phystek nodded, grimly. "The AIs were an engineered crisis, tailor-made enemy designed to consolidate their power, and turn the population's attention away from their corrupt and bloated government -- as well serving their long-term goal of reducing the Earth's population. It was only when their death machines evolved, and started killing people the UN didn't want dead, that the powers-that-be sought my help to stop them."

The prisoner sighed, leaning against the wall, his head tilted upward. "That's why I wouldn't help them. It wouldn't stop the killing, in the end. It would just let them be more selective about it."

They were silent for a moment, and then Parker spoke.

"I'm going to get you out of here." he said at last, his voice hard.
