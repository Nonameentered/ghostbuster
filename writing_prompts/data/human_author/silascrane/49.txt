Prince Allen watched in bemusement as his father, King Eamon the Just, tucked neat cloth bundles of trail rations into the saddlebags buckled onto his faithful steed. Nearby, Archmagus Erlemar, Eamon's ancient court wizard, sat cross-legged atop an old threadbare rug floating a few feet off the hay-strewn floor of the royal stables. Gomer, Eamon's teenage apprentice, stood by his master's flying carpet, wringing his hands nervously. 

"Father," the Prince began, hesitantly but King Eamon cut him off, turning to face his son with a pair of sturdy boots in each hand.

"Which do you think, boy? These boots made by the Forest Folk are hard-wearing, and provide peerless footing, but these black sealskin ones I got as a gift from the Northmen are warmer -- and waterproof, as well. I want to be well prepared, but I don't think I can lug around *two* spare pairs of boots."

Before Allen could reply, Erlemar interjected. The mage casually waved a wizened hand, and conjured a battered wooden trunk on the flying carpet beside him. With an additional twitch of his fingers, the lid unlatched and sprang open. 

"I've a bottomless trunk, Eamon, remember? Unless you've got more boots than would fit in a hay barn, you can bring them all, if you like." the Wizard said, amiably. 

"You're taking that with you, too?" Gomer exclaimed.

"I am." Erlemon confirmed, nodding at his apprentice, placidly. "It's high time you made your own trunk, anyway."

The king laughed good-naturedly. "Of course!" Eamon dropped both pairs of boots into the magical trunk, and snapped the lid closed again.

Prince Allen crossed his arms. "Father!"

Eamon turned back to him. "Yes, son?"

"You can't just go off adventuring!" Prince Allen scolded. "You're the the king!" 

Eamon nodded soberly. "True, true. Kings can't just go gallivanting off over hill and dale -- too much responsibility. Wouldn't be right."

Prince Allen blinked. "But isn't that exactly what you're planning to do?"

Eamon flashed his heir a grin. "Absolutely! But not before I hand you *this."* 

The King reached into his surcoat, and produced a scroll bound with a leather cord and marked with the royal seal.

Prince Allen took the scroll and opened it, then paled as he read the terse proclamation it contained.

"A Writ of Abdication?" Prince Allen cried. 

"The *king* can't go rambling off in search of glory," Eamon said, as he adjusted the saddle girth on his mount. "But old *Lord Eamon* can do as he likes."

"I just got married!" Prince Allen protested. "My wife is with child! I can't take the throne right now!"

"And I assure you, *your majesty,* that it's well within the realm of possibility to be husband, father, and king all at once." Eamon said, wryly. "I did it, after all. Anyway, I'll be back for the Solstice."

"Unless we die." Erlemon added, pleasantly, as though the discussing the possibility of mildly inclement weather, instead of the demise of himself and his monarch.

"Unless we die." Eamon agreed. "But barring that, I do very much want to meet my grandchild."

"Why are you doing this?" Allen demanded, throwing up his hands in consternation. He paused, as his father's face suddenly became more sober again.

"It's...well, what did you call it, Erlemon?" Eamon asked, glancing at his court wizard.

"An experiment!" the wizard said. 

"Begging your majesty's pardon..." Gomer said, looking between Allen and his father as if not sure whom he should now address in that manner. "But, what sort of experiment?"

"An *historical* one." Erlemon explained.

Eamon nodded. "Our lands were once a group of squabbling fiefdoms. But over the course of my reign, we've become a strong, prosperous kingdom -- a truly unified nation, stretching from the mountains to the sea."

"Exactly! So why are you *quitting?"* Prince Allen demanded.

"History...!" Gomer gasped, and then flinched as all eyes turned to him. "Er, that is to say, your majesty...majesties...it occurs to me that we are, right now, at the point in a nation's history where kingdoms and empires tend to unravel. As the original unifying or conquering monarch fades with age, his successor or successors become a target -- if not for assassination, then for manipulation by those who wish to make a puppet of him."

Erlemon beamed at his apprentice. "Very good!  So, can you guess the nature of our experiment?"

Gomer stammered nervously for a moment, but then recovered. "Well, I...usually the old power structures become a target for subversion, and / or the heir begins to chafe under his parents' rule, and becomes impatient to assume the throne. This leads to all kinds of problems, and to all manner of bloodshed, more often than not. So, I suppose you're thinking that, in light of that, you'll try something radically different. You want to see what happens if, well..."

"...if we just *go."* the king finished, winking at his son. "See, you can't grow to resent my prolonged reign if I'm not king, now can you?"

"I don't resent it!" Prince Allen exclaimed, crossly. "I don't *want* to be king yet!"

The king waved his hand, dismissively. "Well, to that I say: *too bad."*

"Udders unchewable." Erlemon agreed, cryptically. 

"Well...but...but...you're taking the court wizard, too?" Prince Allen cried, increasingly flustered.

"Not without leaving an ideal candidate for the position." Erlemon amended, gesturing to Gomer.

"Master...!" Gomer groaned, pleadingly.

Erlemon looked around, an expression of confusion on his face. "Who *are* you talking to, Gomer?"

Gomer blinked. "Um, you, Master?"

Erlemon shook his head. "No, no -- one doesn't called a fellow full wizard 'Master'. 'Erlemon' will do, or 'Magus Erlemon' when formality is called for."

"When--" Gomer began, but the elder wizard cut him off.

"Oh, I conjured all the appropriate paperwork yesterday, while I was in the bath." Erlemon answered, waving his hand dismissively. "It will have arrived at the Mage's Guild by fairy post this morning, so it's all official, by now. You're a wizard in your own right, and a shoe-in for the new king to appoint you in my place, if I'm not mistaken."

Gomer swallowed hard. "But I...I don't want to be Court Wizard! Not yet! I'm not ready!"

Prince Allen scowled. "Join the queue, *Magus* Gomer."

The King -- that is, the *King Emeritus* Lord Eamon -- simply chuckled, as he led his horse out of its stall. "Erlemon and I discussed this for a long time. We're confident that you're both up to your respective challenges. Do you know what we concluded that the offices of King and Court Wizard have in common?"

"What's that?" Allen sighed, beginning to feel resigned.

As Eamon mounted his horse, the old wizard rose through the air to float beside him on his flying carpet. The former monarch turned his mount, and faced his successor.

"That positions with as much power as our former offices," Eamon proclaimed, "Should always be filled by someone who *doesn't* want them."
