It's meant to be coffee after the basketball game, not the monster hunt, so it wouldn't be that late. I can make that clearer. I didn't go out much in highschool, but in college kids went out for coffee at all hours. They're too young to drink, so what else do teenagers do for dates? I honestly don't know. Lol.
