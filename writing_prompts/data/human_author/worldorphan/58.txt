The journey to the Tower of Fangs was arduous. Without the strength the sword gave him, Bradoc couldn't have managed it. In every town they passed through, they heard stories of the Demon Lord's servants and their predations on the locals. Farms ransacked, travelers attacked, people kidnapped or killed outright. The more they saw and heard, the more convinced he became that he'd made the right choice.
  

  
The tower itself looked like a ruin. It had stood uninhabited for forty years, and it's recently returned owner had done little to restore the outside of it. Brambles choked the grounds, and vines climbed the crumbling stone facade. They met little resistance on the outside. Guards protected the lower levels, goblins and fiends. The four younger heroes, working in concert, dispatched them without too much trouble, though the troll on the third floor gave them pause. And eventually, they reached the top floor, where the Demon Lord Vezroloth waited for them.
  

  
“You've gotten old,” Vezroloth taunted, reclining on his throne at the far end of the hall as they entered. He was tall, with lean muscle and grayish skin. Ram-like horns curled back from the sides of his head. His eyes had slitted pupils like a cat's, and his teeth were pointed fangs.
  

  
“And you haven't aged a day,” Bradoc replied. “Though I haven't been dead for the last forty years. Don't you think being reborn is cheating?”
  

  
Vezroloth stood languidly, and took a few steps down from the dais. He looked them over. “Is this really the force that fate has chosen to try to conquer me this time? An old man, and a handful of women?”
  

  
Zaharis cleared his throat.
  

  
“Oh. I beg your pardon. It's the haircut, I think. Do the ladies find that attractive these days?” He sighed. “I suppose it's time to dispense with all this witty banter.”
  

  
“You think you're witty?” Zaharis said.
  

  
The Demon Lord drew a sword from a sheath on his back and slammed it into the ground in a smooth, powerful motion. A circular wave of energy swept across the floor. Natsuko flipped over it easily, and Lorelei staggered, but recovered. But Bradoc, Zaharis, and Tasmyne were sent flying.
  

  
Vezroloth rushed forward, attempting to close with the fallen wizard before he could recover, but Lorelei stepped into his path. She swung her mace, and he parried the blow, then followed up with a punch to her temple with his off hand. It sent her reeling, and he shoved past her.
  

  
Suddenly, Vezroloth staggered. Natsuko tumbled back, her knives dripping with blood from the slashes she'd put in his leg and his side. He whirled after her, but she dodged his sword. After two swings, he snarled a word of power and wave of fire rolled off of the blade. There was too much for her to avoid, and she dropped, curling around painful burns on her arms and chest.
  

  
A bright chord of music cut through the room. Tasmyne had regained her feet, her violin tucked up under her chin. Zaharis stood beside her. The wizard gestured, and lightning arced out from his hands and struck the Demon Lord. He staggered, but kept moving. 
  

  
Then Bradoc was in front of him, the Vigilant Angel Sword pressed against Vezroloth's demonic blade. Tasmyne's chords skipped into a vibrant, energizing reel. Suddenly, the Demon Lord was surrounded. Natsuko's knives flashed, and Lorelei's mace crashed. Zaharis channeled tight beams of fire and ice into the fray.
  

  
Vezroloth stood in the center of the melee, blade slashing like a whirlwind, fire blooming in it's wake. One by one, he cut them down. Bradoc was the last one standing. Parrying blow after blow, the old warrior led him away, giving Tasmyne time and room to begin healing her friends. 
  

  
Vezroloth said another word of power, and his sword blade suddenly hummed and turned black. It crashed into the Bradoc's balde. There was a sound like a thousand tortured souls screaming, and the Vigilant Angel Sword shattered.
  

  
Vezroloth's blade cut a deep gash across Bradoc's chest, and he fell to one knee. The Demon Lord took a moment to stand over him, gloating. He hung his head, waiting for the death blow to come. He'd failed. His sword, the sword made to defeat evil, was gone. The borrowed strength it had lent him was gone as well. His allies lay wounded, possibly dying, because he'd failed to protect them. Just like he'd failed to protect his best friend, Holden, forty years ago. And now that sacrifice was in vain, too. It was over.
  

  
Soft music reached Bradoc's ears. He glanced over and saw Tasmyne with her violin in hand once more. Lorelei had recovered, and was channeling healing magic into the others.
  

  
“Get up!” Tasmyne shouted, the music increasing in tempo as she spoke. “I know your story. You didn't beat him before because of that magic sword. You beat him because you have the heart of a hero!” 
  

  
The music swelled into a battle march. Something swelled inside Bradoc as well. He was weaker, slower, older, but he still knew how to fight. Vezroloth's guard was down. He wouldn't get a better opportunity.
  

  
Bradoc delivered a precise uppercut to Vezroloth's smug jaw. The Demon Lord stumbled, fumbling to bring his weapon to bear. Lorelei's mace lay a few feet away. Bradoc rolled, grabbed it, and swung it at Vezroloth, knocking his sword from his hands. He swung the mace again, but missed. Then they grappled for the demon blade. There were several moments of confusion; then Bradoc had the sword in his hand. Tasmyne's music had become a triumphant fanfare. Bradoc swung the demon blade with all his might, and Vezroloth's head was parted from his body and rolled across the floor.

The tavern wench poured another round for all of them, except Lorelei, who didn't drink. Bradoc drank deeply, pride making his head swim as much as the alcohol. All the extra vitality the Vigilant Angel Sword had given him had faded. He would need help opening pickle jars again. But he'd defeated the Demon Lord for a second time. He'd protected the kingdom from a tyrant, hopefully for another forty years. He'd gotten to be a hero, one last time. It was more than he'd ever hoped for. It was enough.
