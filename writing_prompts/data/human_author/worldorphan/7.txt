**The Sinkhole**
  

  
There's a sinkhole in the woods outside of town. That's not so unusual. The Appalachians are full of sinkholes. The bedrock in these parts is mostly limestone, easy for water to dissolve away, leaving  empty voids just below the surface.
  

  
In that way, our sinkhole is just like any other. If you put something large into it, whatever it is will slowly disappear into the earth at the bottom. No one remembers when it started, chucking unwanted items into the hole. Sometimes you needs to get rid of something, and it's too much trouble to haul it to the county landfill. Sometimes it's just fun to watch shit sink. They say the hole is bottomless. I'm sure it isn't really, but who cares if it's true or not? I'll be long gone from this town before it ever fills up.
  

  
I used to go there often. I got hooked on seeing the weird stuff people tossed in. It takes a couple of days for stuff to sink completely, so there's always something there, halfway swallowed up by dirt. And sometimes stuff would be sitting on the side of the hole, like somebody didn't get it close enough to the middle for it to sink. At least, that's what I *used* to assume.
  

  
The legend has been told and retold for decades, that stuff didn't just sink down into the hole. Sometimes, things would come back out. I never believed it, not until I saw it happen myself.
  

  
I wouldn't have realized it was happening, except that the object in question was mine, a beat-up old desk I'd owned since I was a kid. But as a gainfully employed adult, I had enough money to buy decent furniture, so into the sinkhole the desk went. Two years later, I was checking out the sinkhole, and I saw, half in, half out, a desk that looked shockingly similar to mine, down to the ugly brass pencil holder. Intrigued, I went back the next day. Not only was it still there, but more of it was sticking up from the dirt. The day after that, it was sitting on the side of the hole. It didn't just look like my old desk. It *was* my old desk. I could see where I'd carved my name into it when I was twelve. But other things were carved there, too. Words in a language I couldn't understand, but which made my blood run cold to read. And when I went back the next day, it was just gone.
  

  
I went to the sinkhole every day, to see if anything else came back up. There was an memorably ugly floor lamp from six months ago. And a blue couch that I'd never seen before, but it's progress from the depths of the sinkhole to its side were unmistakable. The lamp, when it reemerged, was twisted in an unnatural way, and the couch was covered in gashes and rents that looked disturbingly like claw marks.
  

  
Then there was the deer. I guess it had fallen in, hurt itself, and been unable to climb back out. It was bloated, rotting, and spawning maggots. But as it lay on the side of the hole, its ears suddenly started twitching. Then it got shakily to its near-skeletal legs and trotted off.
  

  
That freaked me out so badly that I didn't go back for several months. But finally curiosity and boredom got the better of me. Then, one day, I saw a human foot sticking up out of the sinkhole. I told myself it was a mannequin. I went back the next day, and the foot had become a pair of legs, their skin livid and mottled with congealed blood. It was definitely *not* a mannequin. I called the police. Anonymously, because I knew how nuts it sounded.
  

  
I made sure not to be there when the police arrived, but I went back later in the day. They had secured the area around the sinkhole with yellow caution tape. Even more of the body, a woman's I could now tell, had emerged. The police seemed at a loss on how to remove it from the sinkhole without sinking themselves.
  

  
That night, I couldn't sleep. In the early predawn, I went back to the sinkhole one last time. The body was lying on the side of the hole, and I was pretty sure the cops hadn't left it there. She lay with her limbs at weird angles, her dress and hair tangled and matted with mud. I told myself it wasn't going to be like the deer. It wasn't going to move. But it did. It twitched, then rolled over, so that she was looking right at me, an unnatural light in her shriveled eyes. 
  

  
I ran, and didn't look back.
