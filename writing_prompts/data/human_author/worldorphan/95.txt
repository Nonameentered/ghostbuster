They  weren't there to slay the dragon. They weren't stupid. An adult dragon was way beyond their capabilities. But the wizard who had hired them said they ought to be able to bargain with it. He had performed an augury, which had told him the dragon was eagerly seeking rubies, not that hard to find really, and they might be able to trade those rubies for the Amulet of Storms which the beast was said to have it its collection.

Lorelei said a quick prayer to the Lady of Green Fields, and they made their way into the cave. Their torches cast ominous shadows on the uneven walls, and bats chirped at them from the ceiling. Tasmyne clutched her violin tightly, unsure if she ought to switch it out for her crossbow, or if bardic magic would be of more use should the worst come to pass.

“That's far enough,” commanded a hoarse male voice. “Do not take another step toward my sun.”

The knight stood at the entrance to a much larger room, and was back-lit by something glowing dimly from within. His armor was an odd style, with leaf-shaped pauldrons, and decorated with a whorled design that made its dimensions hard to discern. His skin was dusky, and his ears were pointed, but much longer than those of any elf they had ever seen.

The three adventurers looked around in confusion. “Your son?” Natsuko asked. Her hands hovered near her daggers. “You have a child in here?”

“No,” boomed a voice so deep it shook the stone. The strange knight took a step to one side, and a pair of enormous eyes met their gazes. The red dragon lay curled on a mound of golden treasure. Tendrils of smoke drifted up from its nostrils. It shifted its massive body to reveal, sheltered against its belly, an orb of fire the size of a man's head. “I have been growing this sun for the past six decades,” the dragon told them. “It is nearly ready. Should any harm come to it, I would be . . . most displeased.”

“We not here to cause any harm,” Tasmyne assured it, stepping forward. “We seek a magic item from your horde. We've brought rubies to trade for it.”

“Give me the rubies,” the dragon rumbled in a tone that brooked no refusal.

“Now, wait,” Natsuko began to argue, but Lorelei handed the sack of rubies to the knight, who tipped them out in front of the dragon.

It opened its jaws and gobbled them in one bite, chewed, then breathed fire over its glowing orb. Then it gave a satisfied sigh. “One more day to cure, and it will be complete,” it informed the knight. “Adelard,” the dragon indicated the knight with a nod of its head, “is from the Otherworld. The sun in his world is dying, cursed by a demon lord. So his people have bargained with me to grow them another one. Soon, tomorrow perhaps, he will take it back to his realm.”

Adelard cleared his throat. “I beg your pardon, Razumierth,” he addressed the dragon, “but we still have not solved the problem of how to replace our cursed sun with the new one. It would take powerful divine magic,” he explained to the adventurers. “And the gods are barred from our world by the same curse that is killing our sun. Our priests no longer have any power.”

“What about priests and gods from this world?” Lorelei asked. “I'm a priestess. I could pray for the blessings of my goddess, then carry the magic with me to your world.”

“And I could boost her powers with my music,” Tasmyne added. “It's not divine magic, but it's inspiring.”

Natsuko shrugged. “I don't know how I can help, but I can at least watch your backs.” She twirled her knives for effect.

“Hmm, that might work,” the dragon Razumierth acknowledged. “Do this for my friend Adelard, and I shall grant you the item you came here to procure, plus one other item of treasure from my horde for each of you.”

And so the following morning, the four adventurers set off, carrying a miniature sun in a magical pouch lined with dragon hide. It was the beginning of a perilous journey into the Otherworld, twilit, blighted, and in need of heroes to save it.
