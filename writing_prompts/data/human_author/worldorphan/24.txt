Something about the people rushing toward Cam felt wrong. Panic rising in their chest, Cam abandoned their luggage and fled, letting the keys pull them along. They clambered back over the turnstile, raced down the corridor, through a waiting area, down another hallway, and into a locker room. Cam bent double, catching their breath. They heard pounding feet, and raised voices. But they sounded distant. Cam had a moment to think. At least, they hoped they did.

The keys jingled again, pointing toward a row of lockers, the sort of where people stored belongings while on long trips. Cam looked around nervously. They didn't like the idea of breaking into someone else's locker, but no one was there to see. Cam held the keys out, and one of them slipped into the keyhole on a locker and turned with a click.

Inside the locker was a blue dufflebag, embroidered with a logo of a star and a shield and the letters I.C.E. “In Case of Emergency?” Or were they someones initials? Cam unzipped the bag. It held some clothes, a toothbrush, and four long wooden sticks. They were carved and polished, and tapered to a point on one end. And they were decorated with odd designs. To Cam they looked decidedly like magic wands.

Suddenly, Cam's pursuers burst into. “Get 'em!” one of them yelled, rushing at Cam. His fists were glowing. The woman behind him was holding a sword. Cam cringed, raising one of the wands in self defense. A gout of flame burst out of it, engulfing their attacker. Cam yelped and dropped the wand.

The other two advanced. Cam held up a second wand. Silvery mist wafted from it, settling over Cam's assailants and encasing them in ice. 

Momentarily safe, Cam wondered what the third wand did.
