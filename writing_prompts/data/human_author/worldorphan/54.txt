>What stories do you think have influenced your own writing?

The first books I can remember falling in love with are the Chronicles of Narnia. They definitely awoke my love of portal fantasy, and my desire to write stories with deep emotional meanings. I owned several beautifully illustrated fairy tale books when I was a girl, and those definitely influenced me as well. Anne McCaffery was very inspiring as well. Reading her books gave me a lot of confidence. The works of Neil Gaiman and Charles de Lint also made me realize how much I loved the modern supernatural genre and gave me a desire to write about strangeness and magic hiding behind the everyday world, and things that you understand as feelings in the corner of your mind and can almost but not quite explain.

>You mentioned that Ellie Windborn has been in your head for quite some time. What put her there originally?

Ellie is part of another story, a YA book about a teenage boy who is a bard and has prophetic dreams of a song that will save his kingdom. The book is a hot mess, and I never finished it, but one of these days I'm going to try again to untangle it. She's also a main character in a novel I have written about a half-fae child living in our world whose souls gets damaged by a psychiatrist trying to “cure” him, and his father's journey through other worlds to restore his soul. I'm still editing it, but hopefully it will get published one day.

>What's your favorite plant?

Wild blackberries, I think. We had a bunch of land when I was a kid, and I would go out and wander by myself and make up stories, and one summer I picked buckets and buckets of blackberries. It's a happy memory.
