Amelia slipped on the gloves.  
  

  
Suddenly, the light of the sun dimmed, and the world was bathed in a sullen red twilight. A fork of lightning split the sky. The earth began to shake. Trevor and Amelia staggered as cracks opened in the ground, and creatures climbed out, skeletons with swords and armor. They chanted in dry, rattling voices. “Shake the earth! Break the chains!”
  

  
The skeletons charged. Amelia's body moved on its own, interposing  herself between Trevor and the undead creature. Its sword clanged against a shield made of shining black stone that had manifested on her left arm. In her right, a sword of crystal appeared, blazing with white light. Again, her arms seemed to move themselves. The sword swept through the skeleton, and it collapsed in a heap of bones.
  

  
Amelia waded into the army of skeletons. She had a vision, a memory of a past life, of herself in the midst of a great battle. From somewhere, a horn began blowing. Clouds rolled in again, and dozens of winged beings descended from them. They were all women, clad in golden armor and horned helmets, and bearing swords and shields like the Amelia's. Their fury broke upon the skeleton hordes, and soon nothing was left but white bone dust.
  

  
The ground stopped shaking, and the sun shone again in the cloudless blue sky.
  

  
“Ames, you were amazing!” said Trevor, coming out from behind the tree where he'd been hiding.
  

  
One of the winged women landed beside them. Amelia stared. “Ms. Nurmoyle?”
  

  
“Well done!” she beamed. “I knew I wasn't wrong about you having Valkyrie blood.”
  

  
“Uh, what just happened?”
  

  
“We won,” said the Valkyrie who spent her time between doomsdays running an antique store. “Ragnarok has been delayed, yet again.”
