**A Week in the Life of an Isekai'd Author**

“Ah, Felicia, come in!” my latest client called. Sir Frederick stood before his mirror, admiring himself. “You're just in time for my Monday meeting with the king. Then I'm heading into the field. Follow me until Friday. I don't do quests on weekends unless the situation is desperate.” He smoothed his hair. “Let's go. Don't want to be late." 

I'm a Chronicler. I follow heroes around, documenting their exploits. This hasn't always been my life. I used to live in Chicago. I wrote fabulisms. Then I got hit by a truck and found myself here, in the kingdom of Fairendon, where my skills as an author give me certain unique powers.

The king sent Sir Frederick after a troop of bandits terrorizing the royal highway. He made short work of them. On Tuesday he killed a dire-wolf stalking the outskirts of a village. On Wednesday, he rescued a baron's daughter from a sorcerer. We spent Thursday traveling into the mountains. Sir Frederick had heard tales of a dragon there. We slept at an inn, where he wooed the innkeeper's daughter. I was asked not to chronicle that.

In the morning, we ascended the peak, to the dragon's lair. I've always been fascinated by the knightly obsession with slaying dragons. It's bragging rights, I suppose, and the treasure's not a bad motivator, either.

Sir Frederick crept into the cave, and I followed, pen and book at the ready. *“Sir Frederick approached the dragon,”* I wrote in my book, *“its red scales glowing faintly with inner fire, as it slept on a mound of gold and faceted gemstones.”*

One of the dragon's eyes opened to a slit, and it inhaled. I wouldn't get paid if my client burned to a crisp. I focused, and poured my will into my pen. *“The knight nimbly dodged the massive gout of flame,”* I wrote, just in time. If Sir Frederick was surprised as his feet carried him to safety, he didn't show it. He probably thought it had been his own preternatural instincts.

He swung his sword, but it rebounded off the dragon's hide. He attempted another attack, but slipped on loose coins. The dragon slashed at him with its claws. *“An overturned vase of gold-inlaid faience shattered under the dragon's blow,”* I wrote.

Rolling away from the broken pottery, Sir Frederick lunged ineffectually at the dragon, then was struck by its tail and sent sprawling. Feeling fled my fingers as I frantically scribbled a narration that might save my employer.

*“From his prone position, he could see a patch of missing scales on the dragon's belly. The tenacious knight struggled to his feet. Dodging flame and claw, he positioned himself precisely, then struck, his sword sinking into the flaw in the beast's armor.”*

The dragon bellowed in pain, then collapsed. Sir Frederick climbed atop it and pulled his sword free, a smug look on his face. I felt a little bad for the dragon. But at least I was going to get paid.
