“Excuse me, ma'am? I need a word with you.” The stranger had an official look to him, dressed as he was in a dark suit with a pressed white shirt underneath and shoes that he probably polished every day. The young woman with the tablet hovering behind him completed the image.
  

  
“Yes?” Kendall asked. The last few days had been odd, and this man didn't seem to herald a return to normality. 
  

  
“We have taken notice of a pattern anomaly surrounding you over the past four days. Every significant person you have met in that time has appeared to you in alphabetical order based on the name by which you address them. Is this a correct statement?”
  

  
It was. She'd really started to notice the pattern on the morning of the second day, after bumping into her cousin Felicia on the bus, followed by an improbable meeting with an old high school buddy named Gary at the coffee shop, and then seeing Helen, who usually didn't make it into work until noon, in the break room. She'd only really been sure yesterday, when, after a working lunch with Paul from HR, she'd run into Quinn, a friend who had moved half-way across the country six years ago, and the only person she'd ever met with a name that started with 'Q'.
  

  
“So?” she answered. She badly wanted to know what this was all about, but she didn't want to seem too eager, in case this guy was trying to take advantage of her somehow. “How do you know about that, anyway?”
  

  
The stranger straightened his tie. “You may find this hard to believe, but it's because we're wizards.”
  

  
“Wizards? Seriously? Did you go to school at Hogwarts? Hey, I bet you're a Hufflepuff, aren't you?”
  

  
His assistant snickered, then rapidly assumed a straight face as he whipped around to glare at her.
  

  
“We have detected your anomaly using a combination of divination spells and computer algorithms,” he explained. “You currently possess an excess of Pattern in your aura, which means you are the focus point for the diametric opposite of a series of Chaos spells enacted recently by a rogue sorcerer. You may even have been in his vicinity when the original Chaos curse was enacted.”
  

  
Kendall's head spun a bit. It was a lot to take in. But she wasn't about to let this weirdo see her squirm. “And?”
  

  
“And we need you to help us defeat him.” The assistant clarified.
  

  
Assuming these people weren't completely insane, that did not sound like something Kendall wanted to do.
  

  
“You don't mean you want me to fight this guy, do you?” Kendall had seen movies and read books about “chosen ones” with special powers. Young people who started off useless and learned to harness their inner strengths. She was pretty sure that wasn't her.
  

  
“No, I think not. Your mere presence should be enough to counteract a significant portion of his magic, so that we can take him out.”
  

  
“Um, okay . . . but who are you people? And who is this chaos wizard? And where are we going?”
  

  
“I am Orville Newton, and this is my assistant Melinda. We're from the Magical Protections Division. It's a little known branch of the Department of Defense.”
  

  

  
“Hi,” said Melinda.
  

  
“The man we’re after is Gabe Hathaway. We’ve been monitoring him since his most recent psych eval threw up some red flags.”
  

  
“Huh?”
  

  
“All magical practitioners, wizards, sorcerers, witches, practicing neo-pagans, etcetera, are required by law to register with the MPD. They must submit a yearly log of all major magical workings, and receive a psychological examination every two years.”
  

  
“Uh, what happens if they don’t?”
  

  
“Don’t worry about that.”
  

  
Kendall glanced at Melinda, who shook her head, as if to imply that she didn’t want to press the issue.
  

  
“As I was saying, we noticed some suspicious behavior on the part of Mr. Hathaway, and four days ago, he was observed casting a massive Chaos spell, of the variety prohibited by bylaw 42.1. We need to contain it, and him, as soon as possible.”
  

  
“So where are we . . .”
  

  
“Close your eyes,” Melinda said as she punched several buttons on a bulky device strapped to her wrist.
  

  
Kendall complied, just as a weird keening erupted from the device. She felt a floating sensation, and an odd pressure. Then her ears popped, and she seemed to be back on solid ground.
  

  
Tentatively, Kendall opened her eyes. Her mouth fell open. She was standing in the middle of Time Square. She’d lived her whole life in Jersey, but she immediately recognized the towering buildings with their bright lights and screens. At the moment, though, all those screens were flashing a nauseating display of rapidly changing, totally random images. The street lights were also flipping through their colors completely out of order. Traffic was a disaster. The remains of half a dozen car crashes blocked the intersections, horns blared angrily, and people shouted obscenities from every direction.
  

  
“Chaos magic,” Orville said, by way of explanation. "It started small, digital clocks displaying the wrong time, cell phone alarms and ringtones playing for no reason. But over the past few days it's grown, and spread. It's scrambled all the computers and cell phones in Manhattan. They had to shut down the Stock Market. Then it got the traffic lights, and you see how that's going.”
  

  
“It's not just electronics,” Melinda added. “Anything that ought to stay stable or follow a pattern, doesn't. Oven temperatures, refrigerators, freezers. So the restaurant industry's screwed. Broadway is a mess because the actors and musicians can't stay in time with each other. Even if the street lights were working, the roads would still be a disaster because car engines aren't running properly. You name it, it's messed up.” She checked her tablet. “It's spread into Brooklyn and Queens. If it reaches JFK Airport . . .”
  

  
Kendall stopped her. “Okay, okay, I get it. What do we do?”
  

  
Orville looked pointedly at the traffic light they were standing under. It stopped flashing randomly, turned yellow, and then red, and stayed that way.
  

  
“We locate Mr. Hathaway and get you as close to him as we can. Then I bring him in.”
