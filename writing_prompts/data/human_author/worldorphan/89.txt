**Songlines**
  

  
It was my dad who first told me about Songlines. He said the Aboriginal peoples of Australia told stories of the adventures of powerful beings traversing the continent during Dreamtime, long ago when the world was still being made. The stories were put to melody, and if people sang them as they traveled, they could use the words and tune to navigate on long journeys. We're Aussies born and bred, but we're not Aboriginal. Our ancestors were Dutch. So Dad might be telling the story wrong.
  

  
My mom says Dad's spirit animal is the quokka. Like those funny little marsupials, he's all grins. He's your best friend, even if you've never met. Photogenic, too. I've told Mom spirit animals aren't even Australian. They're Native American. Mom doesn't care. She says she's a child of the whole world. Dad says it doesn't matter where a story comes from, or even if it's true, as long as it teaches you something. Even if all it teaches you is how to be happy for a minute. 
  

  
I'm going home today, to Albany, where I grew up. We have quokkas there. My big sister got bitten by one, once. She say this just proves that you can't let appearances fool you. This is Australia, after all. Fifty percent of the wildlife is poisonous, venomous, or just out to get you. But I know that she was trying to put the quokka into her knapsack. Which just proves that even the happiest creatures on earth have their limits.
  

  
After college, I left the city to do water conservation work in the middle of nowhere. It's three hours to Albany, if I drive through Stirling Range National Park. We used to hike there. Dad would tell stories the whole way.
  

  
I'm just entering the park when my car starts making noises; then smoke starts coming out of the hood. Fifteen minutes later, it emits a loud bang and stalls out. I take out my cell phone. No signal. Not a surprise, really. This is a problem. I have to be in Albany by tomorrow afternoon. I'm supposed to arrive tonight, so I can help organize things. Not that they actually need me. Sis will have everything planned out, and it just isn't in her nature to let other people help.   
  

  
Well, it's not in my nature to give up. I don my duffle bag like a backpack, then start walking. I'm singing “Waltzing Matilda.” Dad loves that song. I wonder if they'll play it tomorrow. Probably not. Sis won't think it's dignified. It won't complement the quandorums she's got planned for her speech, and yes, it'll be filled with two-dollar words like that. She won't let me say anything, I bet. That's okay. It's not like I want the attention.
  

  
It starts raining. There's no shelter, nothing but scrubby trees for miles. The rain increases, until I can't see where I'm going. I hear the blare of a truck-horn, but it's distant. Suddenly I realize I'm not on the road anymore. I'm on a dirt trail. I turn around and follow the trail back the way I came, but then it branches. I pick the most likely one. There's another branch, and another. I'm going uphill. That's not right. I'm really lost, now. 
  

  
The rain stops, but its getting dark. I'm not worried. Dad wouldn't be worried. I start walking again. Singing, too. But what comes out isn't “Waltzing Matilda.” I don't know what it is. If this song has words, I don't know them. But it matches the rhythm of my feet. I get to a fork in the trail. As my foot hits the ground, the pitch of the song jumps to a high note. There's a peak in the distance to my right. I take the right fork. At the next fork, the notes are quick and bubbly. A little brook runs by on the left, so I turn that way. I don't know how, but the song is guiding me. Like the Aboriginal Songlines, the melody matches the topography around me. I can follow it, even with no words.
  

  
The music swells inside me. The clouds part, and I'm looking at a sky full of brilliant stars. I hear a voice behind me. “Hey, Kiddiwink.”
  

  
“Hey, Dad.” I don't turn around.
  

  
“You found my Dreaming.”
  

  
“I don't think you're using that term right, Dad.”
  

  
He laughs. “I'm proud of you, you know.”
  

  
“I'm gonna make it to your funeral tomorrow. No worries.”
  

  
“I never worry.”
  

  
The music stops, and I know he's gone. But I'm back on the road. Headlights wash over me as a truck pulls up beside me. The driver asks me where I'm going, offers me a ride. Dad's right again. No worries.
