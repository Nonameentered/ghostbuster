**Sketches**

Nina skipped down the sidewalk toward the park at the far end of the subdivision. She never went out without a book under her arm, usually her sketchbook. She liked to draw things from her imagination.
  

  
“Hey, Shrimpo!”
  


Nina froze. That voice belonged to Peyton Starnes, Nina's neighbor. Peyton stepped out from behind a tree, onto the sidewalk, blocking Nina's path. A fifth grader, Peyton was enormous compared to Nina, who was small even for a third grader.
  

  
“Where ya goin', Shrimpo? The park? Did your mommy give you money for the ice cream man?”
  

  
Somebody grabbed Nina from behind, pinning her arms. “If you've got money, you better give it to us,” said Layla. She was Peyton's best friend from a few streets over, and did pretty much whatever Peyton told her.
  

  
Nina struggled against Layla as Peyton snatched away her purse. She rifled through it, tossing colored pencils and erasers onto the ground. She pocketed two lollipops, and handed a third to Layla. At last she located the money. “Six dollars? Thanks, kid,” Peyton laughed.
  

  
Nina wrenched her arms away from Layla and grabbed for the money. Her sketchbook fell to the ground, and Peyton snatched it up, holding it high out of Nina's reach.
  

  
“Wow, look at all these dumb animals,” she smirked, flipping through the drawings. “*Poiloog. Friendly, furry, hops and swims. A frog and a pug puppy juts . . . jupso . . .*”
  

  
“Juxtaposed,” Nina mumbled. It was her new favorite word. It described what she like to do with her art so well, and it was fun to write, with that big X right in the middle of it. She reached for the book, but drew back as Layla stepped toward her, punching her fist into her palm.
  

  
“Making up words now, too, freak?” Peyton ripped the poiloog page from the book.
  

  
Nina shrieked and tackled Peyton. The eight-year-old's head connecting with her stomach was the last thing Peyton was expecting. She toppled, and before she could recover, Nina had the sketchbook and was running for her life.
  

  
Nina knew she was dead. Fighting back against Peyton had been exactly the wrong move. The fifth graders would beat her to a pulp, Then, when she finally crawled home, battered and bruised, she would get punished for fighting, and Peyton and Layla would get nothing, because their parents never believed anything bad about them.
  

  
Piles of gravel and trash loomed ahead of her. The dump was one of Nina's favorite places. People threw away such interesting things. And she loved how weeds and flowers grew out from the trash. Life persisted even in these conditions, and it made her hopeful, most days. Right now, she just hoped she could find a place to hide.
  

  
Nina's foot caught on something and she fell on her face. She heard shouts and pounding feet coming closer. They would be on her before she could get up. She cringed in terror and waited for the blows to land. 
  

  
Something wet and furry touched her hand. She looked up to see a canine face with a rather squashed muzzle. The thing hopped around her, showing off its furry body and long legs ending in webbed feet. It was a poiloog! Just like she'd drawn it!
  

  
“Where'd you come from, buddy?”
  

  
“What the heck is that?” said Peyton. Nina rolled over, her blood turning cold. But before the older girls could cream her, the poiloog leaped, crashing into Layla with the full weight of its chubby pug body. Peyton kicked it, sending it tumbling away with a pained yelp.
  

  
Nina surged to her feet. It was bad enough that Peyton and Layla bullied her. But the poor poiloog! It had been helping Nina, and she'd let it get hurt. “Just leave us alone!” Nina yelled, balling her fists.
  

  
Peyton and Layla started to laugh, but were cut off by a tremendous roar. A shadow fell over them, and the ground shook. Nina looked back. And up. Another creature from her sketchbook towered over them. The Trygascipor! Kludged together out of pieces of other monsters, it had two dragon-like heads attached to the body of a tyrannosaurus, with heavy crab-like claws and a scorpion's tail. 
  

  
Peyton and Layla stared in disbelief for a few seconds. The monster roared again, and the two girls screamed and fled. Peyton stood alone in the dump, with her imaginary animals.
  

  
The Trygascipor bent one of it's heads down and gave Nina a finical sniff. Then it turned and stomped off into the woods. 
  

  
Nina knelt and scratched the poiloog behind its ears, laughing as it responded by licking her face. “I'm not sure if you're real or not. But either way, do you want to be my pet?”
