**The Star of the Zenith**
  

  
The rope bridge swayed alarmingly beneath her. Josette Morrow couldn't help looking down at the ground, barely visible miles and miles below. After years of research and exploration, she'd arrived at the floating islands of the Estervale Skyfields. Ranging in size from a few square feet to a few acres, the masses of earth hung suspended in the air, scattered across the sky. The remains of ancient temples dotted the islands, hiding knowledge, and treasure.
  

  
On the far side of the bridge, striated columns lined a piazza, grass forcing its way between old stones. Halfway through, Josette felt a stone sink under her shoe with a soft click. She dropped and rolled forward as blades sprang from recesses in the columns, barely missing her. Regaining her feet, she marveled at the trap, obviously enchanted to last through the ages. Its presence meant she was on the right track.
  

  
Josette continued her ascent, crossing more rope bridges rotted to dangerous fragility or strengthened by overgrowing vines, and narrowly avoiding more traps that had protected the secrets of that place for centuries. She stopped frequently to make notes, take rubbings, and gather shards of carved stone. 
  

  
At last she reached it, the Altar of the Empyrean. The building was mostly intact, a cylindrical structure topped with a spire like the horn of some mythic beast. Inside Josette beheld a massive stone coffer, covered in pictographs and sigils. Sections of its face spun and shifted, a lock in the form of an intricate puzzle. Solving this was something only she could do. It took hours, but at last, with a clunk that reverberated through the stone, the final piece slid into place, and the coffer opened, revealing the Star of the Zenith.
  

  
Behind her, a baritone voice chuckled. “Miss Morrow. It appears you've done all the hard work for me!”
  

  
“Rothley Grimvauld. I should have known you'd follow me here. This artifact is the rightful property of the Royal Historical Society.”
  

  
“Do you even know what it does?” Her rival scoffed. 
  

  
“Of course I know! That's why I'll never let you get your hands on it!” She slipped the artifact into her pocket and drew her rapier. 
  

  
Grimvauld lunged at her. She parried his sword, danced away from him and sprinted for the bridge.
  

  
Two of Grimvauld's henchmen were waiting for her on the next island. Josette leapt atop a fallen pillar. The larger man swung his cutlass at her, but she hopped over the blade and struck him across the temple with the pommel of her rapier. He collapsed, stunned.
  

  
Thinking himself cleverer than his comrade, the other swordsman joined her on the pillar. She'd been hoping for that. She feinted right, then slashed low across his legs. He lost his footing and fell, knocking himself out cold.
  
“Well done,” Grimvauld conceded. He stood between Josette and her escape route. He'd activated the spells on his sword, which now blazed with fierce energy.
  

  
She dove from the pillar and rushed her rival. He parried her blows easily. Near-misses from his blade made her skin blister. Pressing the attack, he forced her backward and sideways, away from the bridge.
  

  
Josette saw the slits in the paving-stone a moment before Grimvauld stepped on it. She shouted out a warning, too late. Blades sprang up from the ground. He managed to leap backwards, but that was the wrong direction. The earth crumbled beneath him, and he toppled over the side of the island.
  

  
She dove after him and caught his hand at the last second, saving him from plunging into the abyss. 
  

  
They regarded one another as he clung to her for dear life. For a moment, Josette considered letting go, ending all her troubles then and there. But no, she was too gallant to let her rival die like that. She pulled him back up to safety.
  

  
He sat beside her for a moment, on the edge of the world, catching his breath. Then, without warning, he shoved her, grabbing her hand and holding her dangling over nothing.
  

  
“Ha! Now our roles are reversed. But unlike you, I do nothing for free. Give me the Star of the Zenith, and I'll pull you up.”
  

  
Josette looked down in distress, and back up at Grimvauld. She thought about the artifact in her pocket. Was it really worth her life? Then epiphany struck, and she realized what she must do.
  

  
With a smile, she let go of Grimvauld's hand.
  

  
As she plummeted, Josette reached for the Star. She was a world-renowned archaeologist, after all. She knew exactly how it worked.
  

  
Josette shouted the command word, and a magnificent dragon appeared, summoned from thin air. She landed on its back. 
  

  
As she soared past an astonished Rothley Grimvauld, she called, “Better luck next time! Adventure awaits!”
