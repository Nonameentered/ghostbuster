**The Riverboat Job**
  


Band music drifted over the still waters of the lake. On the steamboat, the party would be going all night long. Rich folks, traveling from Jefferson, Texas, across Caddo Lake, down Big Cypress Bayou, to Shreveport, Louisiana, filled the night with their voices. They were drinking, dancing, gambling, and carrying on in that stuffy yet excessive manner that is the purview of rich folks. The lanterns lighting up the steamboat meant they were night-blind to the bayou around them.
  

  
Henry silently paddled his little fishing boat up to the side of the steamboat. He hooted like an owl signaling his brothers that he was in place. On the deck, a gunshot rang out. “Give us all yer money!” Luke barked. This was followed by a cacophony of alarmed voices and clomping feet, and several more gunshots. Then Luke and Jed dropped into the boat.
  

  
“Get us outta here!” Luke hollered.
  

  
“I done been shot!” Jed wailed.
  

  
“It's just a graze, dummy,” Luke said. “Quit yer belly-achin'.”
  

  
Henry leaned into the oars, and the boat raced over the dark lake. 
  

  
“Tarnation!” Jed exclaimed. “Are we takin' on water?”
  

  
“One a them bullets must a hit the boat!” Luke said. “Henry, keep rowin'. Jed, you help me bail.”
  

  
Henry rowed with industry, and they slipped into the deeper shadows beneath the cypress trees. He maneuvered the boat between the maze of wide boles and knobby cypress knees, slick as a fish. An hour later, they reached their destination, a little island with an old wooden shack slouching on it, deep in the swamp. It had endured for decades, the perfect hiding spot. They hauled the boat up onto the muddy shore.
  

  
Luke dropped a sack onto the shack's porch, coins clinking cheerfully inside it. “There must be four hundred dollars in there,” Jed said is awe.
  

  
Luke nodded. “And that ain't countin' all the jewelry.” 
  

  
“What the blazes is this?” Henry asked. He pulled out a pendant nearly the size of his palm. A dime-sized red stone glittered in the center of an ornate golden disk. It was decorated with images of feathers, snakes, and what looked like a large bug.
  

  
“Some old biddy had it.” Luke told him, hanging it around his neck. “She was shoutin' that it was an artifact from the Orient, and I'd be cursed if I took't it from her. I reckon she was makin' up a yarn, though. Ain't no such things as curses.”
  

  
“We gonna sell that for a heap a money, right Luke?” said Jed.
  

  
“Abso-tootin-lutely! We're gonna lay low out here for a week or so. Then we're gonna go down to Shreveport, ride the steamboat to New Orleans, sell all these bangles, and start livin' the good life.”
  

  
Luke went inside and came back out with a bottle of whiskey. But as he stepped onto the corner of the porch, it collapsed under him. They hauled Luke, beat up and cursing but not badly hurt, out from the jumble of broken boards. Henry guessed the weather had abraded away the supports over time. It couldn't have anything to do with a curse. 
  

  
The sky was just getting rosy when Henry awoke to the sound of Luke swearing. He had his fishing line out, and had managed to put the hook right through his thumb. 
  

  
“You should wait til later in the day to fish,” Henry told him. “There's likely to be gators around here, and dawn's when they hunt most.”
  

  
“Yeah, well, I'm hungry.” He got the hook out, and wiped his bleeding hand on his shirt. Henry noticed he was still wearing that ugly pendant.
  

  
Jed stomped down to the shore, twisting his ankle in hole on the way. He cast, and his line got stuck in a tree. He waded into the shallows to get it free.
  

  
“What's beneath the water?” Jed asked Henry. “Do ya see somethin' movin'?”
  

  
The enormous alligator  surfaced and chomped right through Luke's leg. He screamed and fell over. The alligator, liking what it had tasted, bit Luke's head clean off, then flopped into deeper water and swam away. Henry and Jed were screaming, too, their voices rising to an embarrassingly feminine pitch.
  

  
Jed seemed to suddenly take notice of Luke's pendant, which was now lying in the mud next to his corpse. He ran to the water, snatched it up, and make to hurl it into the lake.
  

  
“Stop!” Henry yelled, grabbing Jed's arm. “If you throw it away, we'll never break the curse. We've got to get it back to that old lady!”
  

  
“Reach for the sky!” the marshals shouted, coming around the shack with their rifles drawn. They'd been found after all.

Jed and Henry let themselves be taken off to jail. It was certainly preferable to being cursed.
