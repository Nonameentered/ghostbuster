**Child of the Ocean**
  

  

  
Ships at a distance have every man's wish on board. They hold the possibility of adventure, freedom, the chance to change one's fate. It's the reason boys sometimes run away to sea. I was one such boy myself. So when Big Jim found the child stowed away in the hold of our ship, I didn't immediately flog him and throw him in the brig. Still, as the bosun, I had to do something.
  

  
"I won't have any layabouts on board," Captain Bly told the boy. "You willing to work?"
  

  
The boy nodded eagerly.
  

  
"You got a name, son?"
  

  
The boy started to shake his head, then, perhaps thinking better of it, said, "Jim," in a raspy whisper.
  

  
"We've already got a Jim. You can be Jay."
  

  
Jay nodded again, pleased.
  

  
"Alright, Mr. Horton, show him the ropes."
  

  
The boy worked hard, I'll give him that. He was a clumsy thing, though. Completely ambisinister, he tied his own fingers into his knots, sliced his hand open peeling potatoes, and all manner of troubles. He rarely spoke, and then always in that raspy, hesitant voice. I never did coax out of him what his life had been before he joined ship. Sometimes pasts are ugly. Live, be happy, and make others so, I always say, never mind what's behind you.
  

  
A few times, I caught Jay sneaking around on deck after dark, climbing up over the rails, as if he'd been in the sea. In the moonlight, my eyes played tricks on me. His damp skin seemed to glisten like silver, and his eyes stared, too round, too wide, too pale. He scampered into the hold with nary an explanation.
  

  
Jay took a particular liking to a crewmate named Sebastian. Sebastian was charismatic, and frequently a source of excitement. Like Jay, I never quite figured Sebastian out. He styled himself as disinherited nobility, but that was likely a lie. He was always telling mad stories about past exploits. Duels, womanizing, adventures. I doubt  half of it was true, but the crew, including Jay, would listen to those tales with rapt attention.
  

  
“That boy spends too much time with you,” I told Sebastian. “You'd better not be teaching him your scoundrel habits."
  

  
“What can I say, Bosun,” Sebastian replied, flourishing his rapier. He'd had that blade when he came aboard, while the rest of us had only knives. I swear, the man thought he was a pirate, instead of a sailor on a common merchant ship. “How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company?”
  

  
“Just watch yourself.”
  

  
Jay had been aboard six months when we hit the squall. All hands were on deck, working the lines, trying to keep our ship from capsizing and the masts from snapping. Sebastian was in the rigging, reefing the sails. Even in those conditions, he couldn't help but show off.
  

  
“Stop swinging from the lines, you addle-headed rapscallion!” I shouted at him. “You'll end up in the drink!”
  

  
A big wave hit starboard, making the ship pitch, and sure enough, Sebastian fell. “Man overboard!” I hollered.  I threw him a line, knowing in these rough seas it was likely hopeless.
  

  
Just then, Jay dove over the side, hitting the waves with the grace of a dolphin. Moments later, he had one arm around Sebastian and the other clinging to the rope. I shouted to the men to help me pull them in. Sebastian started screaming and thrashing. I couldn't fathom why he would panic in his moment of rescue. Then Jay clouted him across the temple, and the fool fell still.
  

  
We hauled them up to the gunnels, and pulled Sebastian aboard first. He came to with a groan. “Monster,” he muttered, becoming more agitated as he collected his wits. “Monster!” he cried again, pointing.
  

  
Jay climbed over the rail, and we all saw. It was Jay. There was something recognizable in the posture, in the expression. But he had changed. His face had narrowed, his head flattened on the sides. His eyes were huge, glassy orbs, and his small round mouth was filled with sharp teeth. Silvery scales covered his skin, and his hands and feet were webbed, with more fins sticking out from his elbows and knees.
  

  
Despite the raging storm, the whole crew stopped and stared at the creature. No one spoke, not even Captain Bly.
  

  
“Monster!” Sebastian yelled again, and the men took up the cry. Jay looked about him for aid, a hurt expression on his fishy face. Before I could act, the men had seized Jay and tossed him overboard.
  

  
Jay gazed up at us from the water for a long moment. Then he let the currents take him. He was soon borne away by the waves, and lost in darkness and distance.
