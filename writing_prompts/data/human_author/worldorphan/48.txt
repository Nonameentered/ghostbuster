**Ghost Ocean**

&#x200B;

I climbed up from the ship's hold into the cool evening air, sensing the recent absence of the sun's warm rays. The texture of the wooden planks gripped my bare feet, helping me keep my footing as the ship rolled with a swell. Arm in arm, Calista and I made our way to the main mast. I let her guide me around coils of rope and other clutter. She ascended the mast first, as her destination was the crow's nest, and mine was lower in the rigging. I perched on a yard and waited for instruction. 
  

  
“More sail!” Mr. Gomez bellowed. “Let out the mizzen sheet and the main topsail! Brace those lines!”
  

  
That was my cue. I slid down a shroud, then scuttled starboard along the yard, counting ropes to keep track of my position. When I reached the right line, I let it out and made it fast again. I heard Raul grunting as he did the same on the port side. The sheet snapped and strained against me as it caught the wind. 
  

  
“Raissa, loose line on the starboard topgallant yard,” Calista called to me. I listened, and heard it whipping against the sheets. I climbed back up the shroud, and over the yard until I reached it and got it secured. 
  

  
My mother knew when she married my father that his heart would always belong to the sea first and to her second. I think she was almost relieved when I was born blind, believing the sea couldn't steal me away from her. But when I was ten years old, I stowed away on my father's ship. When my he discovered me, he tanned my hide. Then he put me to work. He must have hoped to shatter all my romantic notions about the life of a sailor. He should have known better. From the first moment I felt the sway of the deck beneath my feet and the sting of salt wind on my face, it was too late for me. 
  

  
I leaned against a spar, pulled an orange from my pocket and ate it, enjoying a moment of calm. Below me on the deck, footsteps paced, coupled with the rhythmic thump of a wooden staff. Mr. Roque, the ship's wizard, was on duty tonight. That meant one of two things. Either a bad storm was approaching, or we were near a ghost sea. And the air didn't feel thick enough for a storm.
  

  
Two hours into the night watch, the ghost chimes began to sound. Long metal tubes without clappers, hanging from the bowsprit, too far apart to touch each other, they could only ring when spirits brushed against them. Mr. Roque chanted a warding spell, and magic crackled through the air. Cold washed over me. Mr. Roque chanted louder, but his voice was strained with fear. The ward wasn't working. Unearthly moaning joined the sound of the chimes.
  

  
Icy wind lanced through the shrouds. The ghosts had gained accessibility to the ship. 
  

  
Calista shrieked, and started to sob. 
  

  
“Their faces!” Raul cried, voice cracking with horror.
  

  
Mr. Roque, no longer satisfied with wards, shouted new spells, and a blast of energy nearly threw me from the yard. The ghosts howled. Mr. Roque gave a strangled cry. I heard the thump of his body falling to the deck.
  

  
Spectral fingers closed around my wrist. I felt icy cold, terror, and rage. And pain. Not mine, but theirs. I didn't fight it. I let their voices rush through me.
  

  
*“My wife left me for another man while I was at sea, and I died before I could take my revenge.”*
  

  
*“My family abandoned me. I died without knowing what it was to be loved.”*
  

  
*“I was afraid to die alone.”*
  

  
*“I never got to live my life the way I wanted.”*
  

  
"You're hurting!" I whispered in surprise. "I'm so sorry! I hurt too.  But every day I wake up and live my life, and get another chance to fix what makes me hurt. You don't have any more chances. It isn't fair. I understand why you're angry. But don't take it out on us. Please. Hurting us won't heal you. Only time will heal you.”
  

  
The chill receded. The voices quieted. I hadn't solved their problems. I hadn't convinced them. But I'd given them something to think about. And they'd give us some peace for the moment.
  

  
The yard I was sitting on shook. “Raissa? Are you all right?” Calista asked, putting an arm around me. The ghosts . . .”
  

  
“Didn't hurt me.”
  

  
“All hands to me,” Captain Saldanha called. We joined him on the deck. “Well done, Raissa,” he said. “You keep on proving that true vision does not require the eyes.”
  

  
“Thanks, dad,” I said. “I mean, Captain.”
