Thanks. I actually hadn't read Rainbow penguin's story when I wrote it. It's awesome when things connect accidentally.

The Talking Tuesday tasks this month were about dialogue. It made me think of an audiobook I listened to of a graphic novel called Locke and Key. It was like a radio play. It had multiple voice actors, and was nothing but dialogue and sound effects. I tried to make my story like that.
