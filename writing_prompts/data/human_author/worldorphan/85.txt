**Serengeti Signs**
  

  
Emily pulled her photography equipment from the back of the jeep. It was a gorgeous day, the sky azure and enormous, stretched above endless tree-studded grasslands. Serengeti National Park was everything she'd hoped it would be.
  

  
Her sister Kelly groaned. "No cell service." She pulled out a magazine and rifled through it. "Want to hear your horoscope?"
  

  
"No."
  

  
"Well, here's mine. *'Leo, if you have to stray out of your comfort zone today, be prepared for trouble.'* I knew I should have stayed at the hotel."
  

  
"Why didn't you? You could have hung out with that cute tour guide you got sloshed with last night."
  

  
"His name is Matt, and I was *not* sloshed. Anyway, you said we were going to see animals. I thought it was going to be like one of those safaris where the giraffes stick their heads in your car."
  

  
"That doesn't really happen, Kelly. And guided animal tours cost, like, thousands of dollars. If you want to see animals in the wild, you have to be patient."
  

  
"Ugh. This is boring. Why can't we go shopping in the city? We're on vacation!"
  

  
"*You're* on vacation. *I'm* on a business trip to photograph wildlife for the magazine. So shut up and let me work."
  

  
In the far-off grass, something moved. A dozen paces from the jeep, Emily crouched, set up her tripod, and peered through the long-range lens. It was a secretary bird. It's long legs, red face, and crest of quill-like black feathers were unmistakable. It strutted about in the grass, hunting. Gray-and-black wings splayed for balance, it delivered several violent kicks to some unfortunate creature before gulping it down.
  

  
Click, click, click. Emily took a barrage of pictures. A second bird joined the first. A mated pair? The magazine would be delighted!
  

  
“Birds? Can you be more boring?” Kelly said. She had tied a gauzy green scarf around her throat. “My horoscope says green is my lucky color today.”
  

  
“You know all that astrology stuff is made up, right?”
  

  
The birds took wing. Emily was about to yell at Kelly for spooking them, when they landed again in a desert date tree, *Balanites aegyptiaca*. She'd found their nest. Click, click, click. She needed a better angle. Emily climbed into the thorny branches of an acacia tree. Clinging awkwardly to a limb, she managed a dozen more shots. She shifted to wipe away the sweat threatening to drip into her eyes, lost her balance, and toppled from the tree. Pain erupted from her ankle as she landed.
  

  
“Emily! Oh my god!” Kelly rushed over. “Your horoscope said to avoid high places today. You should have let me read it to you!”
  

  
“Just a stupid coincidence.” Emily gasped as Kelly hauled her up. "Damn. I think my ankle's broken.”

Kelly helped her sister to the jeep. “Slow down,” Emily commanded as Kelly drove along the dirt road leading back to the hotel. Suddenly, there was a thump, and the jeep careened to the side.
  

  
“What did you do?”
  

  
Kelly hopped out to check. “We've blown a tire. Crap. I've never changed a flat before.”
  

  
“Are you serious? Well, I can't do it.” Her patience with her sister was shrinking by the minute.
  

  
Under Emily's direction, Kelly located the tire iron, car jack, and spare tire. She got the jack in position and raised the car, but when she tried to remove the wheel, the bolts wouldn't come loose. Cursing, she gave the jack a kick. It slipped, and bent under the weight of the vehicle.
  

  
“What do I do now?” Kelly wailed.
  

  
Emily ground her teeth. Her eyes fell on her sister's magazine. *'Leo, your temper will be your undoing, if you let it, so try to keep a cool head.'* And hers read *'Virgo, family matters will complicate your day.'* 
  

  
She'd thought there wasn't a skerrick of truth to this stuff, but she was beginning to wonder.
  
All at once, Kelly jumped up and waved her arms in the air. A distant cloud of dust became a tour bus, which pulled up beside them, and a familiar face leaned out.
  

  
“Matt!” Kelly gushed. “Man, am I glad to see you!”
  

  
In minutes, Kelly's cute tour guide had changed their tire. His strength was surprising. He also splinted Emily's ankle. For the rest of the day, the sisters trailed behind the tour bus in their jeep. Emily got photos of giraffes, zebras, and a vulture. And when the tour stopped for lunch, Kelly and Matt disappeared for thirty minutes and reappeared with their clothes all rumpled.
  

  
Lounging in the jeep, Emily finished reading the horoscopes. *'Leo, help will come when you least expect it, along with a chance for romance.'* And *'Virgo, try to have a little faith. Everything will work out in the end.'*
