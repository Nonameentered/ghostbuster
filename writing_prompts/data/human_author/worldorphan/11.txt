How about something like this:

PART 1: You are [character from fandom he likes - super heroes, Harry Potter, etc]. You are with [other character from fandom] when you find a [genie, wishing wand, etc]. You get one wish, but can only wish for something for someone else. So you wish for something nice or cool for [other character]. What do you wish for? Why? What happens?

PART 2: You [the fandom character] watch your friend enjoy the benefit of your wish, while nothing has changed for you. How do you feel? What do you say or do? What happens?

And other similar scenarios with moral dilemmas or thought provoking situations, with characters he is familiar with.
