>1. What are your favorite genres to write in?

My favorite genres to write in are modern supernatural, and portal fantasy. I enjoy the subtle side of the supernatural genre, not like there are secret societies of vampires and wizards everywhere with lots of politics, but like the world is mostly normal and people have ordinary lives, except sometimes you encounter a fae or a cryptid on your walk through the park, or maybe you find a door to another world in a forgotten corner of an old house. And I like portal fantasy because it allows for lots of world-building, and variety and flavor, but you don't have to go into too much depth with it. I also really like it when characters from other stories have unexpected cameo appearances, and portal fantasy is great for that. My characters, in particular, don't like to stay in their own stories.

>2. Do you have a favorite story youâ€™ve written for the sub?

It's hard to choose, but maybe this one: [https://www.reddit.com/r/HallOfDoors/comments/plegwh/the\_guardian\_toys/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HallOfDoors/comments/plegwh/the_guardian_toys/)

It was a really neat prompt, and I think I took it in an interesting direction and came up with some good characters for it.

Coke Zero, and chocolate.
