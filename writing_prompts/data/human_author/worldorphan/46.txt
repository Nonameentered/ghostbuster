“That one never gets old,” Tasha told me as the kids walked away. They hadn't tipped as well as the ladies, but teenagers never do. She leaned against a wall, letting her violin dangle at her side. I slouched next to her.
  

  
A ways up the street, something caught my eye. A young woman was coming our way, walking a little too fast. She glanced around her nervously, looking back over her shoulder every few seconds. My fingertips tingled as she drew near. I wondered if she wasn't also touched by the yokai, or fairies or whatever other supernatural spirits might haunt America. I flashed her a reassuring smile and stepped forward, folding a paper cat as I did so. But her expression pleaded with me to leave her alone, so I stepped back again to let her pass. She wasn't just nervous. She was terrified. 
  

  
Then I saw the reason why. The two men coming around the corner were the opposite of subtle. The one on the left looked like he had a gorilla somewhere back in his family tree. The one on the right looked like he could win a glaring contest with a shark. No wonder the girl wanted to get away from them.
  

  
Knowing I was about to do something phenomenally stupid, I sidled down the street to a narrow spot between a fire hydrant and a magazine stand. Folding paper furiously, I waited until the men were at a point where they would have no time to find a way around, then stepped into that space and directly into their path. 
  

  
“Ta da!” I yelled, tossing up the dozen cranes I had just made, so that they hovered in the thugs' faces. They hesitated for a moment in confusion. Then the meatier one shoved me out of the way. I fell, and rolled with the momentum, willing my body to be a bit lighter and more flexible than normal. I came to rest, unharmed, against a planter. I looked up. The goons had picked up their pace, and were gaining on the woman as she wove through the crowd.
  

  
Without getting up, I took out my glass juggling ball and rolled it across the sidewalk towards the thugs. Then I focused my will with an intensity I had only used a few times before. When the ball was right under their feet, it exploded in a plume of thick blue smoke. They staggered, blinded and coughing, waving their arms to clear the air. I got to my feet and hurried forward. The thugs managed to fight their way out of the smoke, but I was ready with my next trick. A long stream of handkerchiefs shot out of my sleeve, winding and coiling around the legs of the neanderthal. He fell over, taking his partner with him. As they struggled to untangle themselves, I sprinted ahead of them, looking for the girl.
  

  
She was just disappearing around a corner. I knew that alley. It was a dead end. I called out to her, but she either didn't hear me or didn't care. In her left hand she held a stick with gems sparkling on either end. It might have been a magic wand, if such things existed. With her right hand she was drawing on the wall with what looked like charcoal. I didn't know what she was doing, but I knew I needed to buy her just another minute or two.
  

  
I stood at the mouth of the alley, and called upon all the magic I could. Flowers and ivy sprang from their planters and grew in long, twisting vines. A garbage can fell over, and paper cups, napkins, wrappers, and other trash rose into the air. When the thugs turned into the alley their way was blocked by a tangle of animated plants and floating garbage. I kept it moving, surrounding them as they pushed forward. None of that stuff was heavy, though, and at last they muscled through it. Only to find me in their way. The smaller one, who was still a foot taller than me, grabbed me and shoved me against a wall. The bigger one raised a fist, and I cringed, envisioning my face as a pancake.
  

  
Then an earsplitting note pierced the air. Tasha had caught up with us. I recovered first. I slipped out of my shocked and deafened assailant's grip. Then I pelted them with all the garbage I had been levitating, as well as several empty beer bottles and broken bricks from the floor of the alley. It was more magic than I had ever used in my life. But would it be enough?
  

  
I looked at the girl. She pressed her hand to the wall, and a glowing doorway appeared. She stepped through it and was gone.
  

  
“No!” the shorter, meaner thug cried, forgetting me and stumbling toward the place where the girl had been. He moved unsteadily thanks to the concussion I had given him. The bigger one was still trying to get back up.
  

  
Moving more nimbly than a person should, I darted past them, grabbed Tasha by the arm and dragged her onto the sidewalk. I called up a trick I had learned from the brief stint in my teenage years when I'd tried to make a living as a pickpocket. Our images blurred just a little, and people's gazes slid off us, just two more faces in the crowd. We hustled away from the alley as fast as we could, until we were certain we weren't being followed.


  
“So,” said Tasha, sinking wearily into cafe chair, “You gonna explain that?” She quirked an eyebrow. “*Can* you explain that?”
  

  
“Nope, and nope,” I said.
  

  
“Fair enough.” She handed me my cap. The money was still inside it. I saw she had her violin case over her shoulder, too. “I think I'm done for the day. Dinner?”
  

  
“Sure,” I said. Some profitable busking, a little adventure, and a date with a hot girl. Today was a pretty good day.
