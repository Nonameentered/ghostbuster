Anyone else would describe the place as quiet, just the hum of insects, the distant sounds of the city, the wind blowing between the headstones and statuary. But to seventeen year old Heather O'Grady, it was one of the noisiest places in the city. A thousand voices wailing, screaming, sobbing, singing. Some of the voices were very old. People had been burying their loved ones in Elmwood Memorial Gardens for nearly two hundred years. Most of the oldest ones were faint, though some persisted. The violent ones, mostly. The more recent ones, they were all loud. 
  

  
A letter left for her by her mother, who hadn't died like her Gran had said, had explained everything. Why Heather could hear the wails of the dead and the keening that heralded an approaching death. Heather's mother was a banshee, a faerie death-herald for ancient Irish kings. Her father had been human, a young man whose inevitable death by cancer had caught a banshee's attention, and whose sweet charm had won her heart. Nine months later, the man was dead, and his mother, Heather's Gran, found a swaddled baby on her doorstep. A changeling, child of two worlds.
  

  
Heather listened. There were no words, but she could tell how each voice felt about their death by the tone of their wails. One in particular caught her ear. Heather followed the voice to a simple rectangular stone set into the earth, a bouquet of wilting flowers on top. Kayla Pruitt, age 19, two years dead. Her death had been violent.  Her cries held notes of terror, pain, but also betrayal, and so much anger. She'd died at the hand of someone she'd trusted. Someone she'd loved. 
  

  
When she got home, Heather googled Kayla Pruitt's obituary. She'd fallen from a balcony. Her death had been ruled an accident. Heather thought of the hurt and rage she'd heard. It hadn't been an accident. Kayla had been murdered, and never received justice.
  

  
Five years later, Heather sat in the computer lab at the Criminal Justice Academy. For her final project, she'd elected to research a closed case. She'd read the files. She'd talked to witnesses, friends and family. She'd had old forensic evidence re-analyzed. And she'd found what had been missed. The victim's boyfriend had been emotionally abusing and gaslighting her for over a year. Forensic evidence showed signs of a struggle. It wasn't enough to bring the boyfriend to trial, not seven years later, but it was a move in the right direction, and seasoned detectives would be picking up the case. Kayla Pruitt would get her justice.
  

  
Five years after that, Detective Heather O'Grady stood in an alley, studying a chalk outline marking where a young man had died. Given the location and the victim's ethnicity, the beat cop who'd found the body assumed it had been a drug deal gone bad. But the fear she heard in the voice his death left behind told a different story. Heather would find justice for him, too.
