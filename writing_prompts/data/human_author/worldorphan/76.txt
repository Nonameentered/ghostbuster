(CONTINUED)

Lorelei and Edelweiss stood guard by the crack. Meanwhile, Natsuko, Zaharis, and Tasmyne set out for the cave where Edelweiss said the Outsider made its lair. According to her, it had been dormant since she had arrived in its plane. They stayed under cover, darting between stone pillars, avoiding bands of minion creatures. 
  

  
The cave was black and still inside. Narrow fissures in the ceiling let in just enough light for them to see the massive form of the monster sleeping within. Tasmyne had been in feast-halls smaller than this beast. It was vaguely crab-like in form. Two thick plates sandwiched a squishy, bulbous body between them. Spine-covered tentacles protruded from between the plates, and some of them sported eyes along their length as well. Twenty or so multi-jointed legs arrayed themselves around the body, each ending in a claw longer than a person. The creature had no discernible head, or even a front and back. How could they fight a thing like that?
  

  
They crept closer their eyes adjusting to the dim light. “Do you see it?” Natsuko whispered, pointing. One of the tentacles was gone, only a stump remaining, and a crack split the lower shell for five feet at the origin point of the missing tentacle. 
  

  
“It's a weak point, all right,” Zaharis replied, “but a creature like this is bound to have immunities . Fire, definitely, probably cold. Lightning might work, though.”
  

  
“Won't know until we try,” Tasmyne said.
  

  
Suddenly, they heard a nasty crunching sound, and Zaharis looked down in alarm. Mouse-sized versions of the crab creatures they had fought at the fissure were creeping around the floor of the cave, and Zaharis had trodden on one. Beside them, the Outsider stirred.
  

  
They hustled back to the mouth of the cave, keeping as quiet as they could, but a pack of a dozen creatures was waiting for them there. Natsuko sliced up one. Tasmyne took out another with her crossbow. Zaharis set the remaining monsters on fire.
  

  
The Outsider made a noise like shearing metal, and began to lumber up on its many legs. 
  

  
“Run!” Zaharis cried. 
  

  
Tasmyne scraped out a quick melody on her violin, sending the music ahead of them, carrying a message. “Coming back, monster following. We woke it. Found a weakness. Prepare to fight.”
  

  
Lorelei and Edelweiss met Zaharis, Natsuko, and Tasmyne halfway between the cave and the fissure. 
  

  
“Keep its attention while we strike at the weak point,” Zaharis ordered. He wasn't usually the de facto leader of the party, but he was currently the one with the plan, and they followed him without question. 
  

  
The Outsider charged at them, its motions deceptively slow, but covering so much ground due to it's enormous size. The two priestesses charged to meet it, swinging sword and hammer at its insectoid legs. Natsuko grabbed Zaharis by the hand and pulled him underneath the creature. 
  

  
“It can't see us under here,” she hissed. “All it's eyes are on the outside of its legs and tentacles. None of them are facing inward. And the only way it can reach us to attack us is to fall on us.”
  

  
“Oh, that's comforting,” Zaharis muttered. He pointed his hands at the crack in the creature's shell, and with a word and a gesture, hurled a bolt of lightning into it. The monster shuddered, flailing its tentacles. Lorelei and Edelweiss rolled out of the way as the spiny protrusions came alarmingly close to them, then whirled and struck the tentacles, eliciting another bellow from the beast.
  

  
Natsuko scaled the backside of a chitinous leg until she was standing on the rim of the lower shell. She'd chosen a spot where she wouldn't come near any eyes. Quick as a squirrel, she crawled to the stump of the tentacle right above the crack in the shell. Her knives sliced its flesh, opening old scars. It shuddered again, and only her keen balance kept her from falling.
  

  
Tasmyne raised her violin and played a battle melody, bold and rhythmic, weaving in confidence and energy. Magic pulled her friends' movements to its steady tempo. Even Edelweiss, who had never fought with a bard before before, slipped easily into the pattern. The sisters struck its tentacles simultaneously, then, in unison, dodged away in opposite directions. Zaharis sent bolts of lightning into its broken shell in a steady rhythm. In the beats between his blasts, Natsuko slashed its stump, and when that seemed not to have as much effect as she'd like, began systematically taking out its eyes. She swung and climbed about its chitinous body, timing her movements so that she was stable when it shook from Zaharis's attacks.
  

  
The Outsider was a creature of chaos. Rhythm and pattern were completely alien to it. Not only could it not predict their movements, but it seemed distressed by so much order in its surroundings. Only by pure luck did it manage to hit Lorelei and Edelweiss, and with only a fraction of its full force.
  

  
"Tasmyne!" Zaharis gasped, bent double and out of breath. He pointed, and she saw that the weak spot had lengthened to a crack that ran nearly the full span of the monster's undershell. It was blackened and fragile looking. One more strong blow would surely do it. Zaharis, though, had reached the end of his strength. He was asking for her help. "Hit it with something sonic!"
  

  
The bard focused her magic, then played a rapid run that went from the bottom of the violin's range to the very top. The violin screamed. Waves of sound, magic coursing through them, struck the Outsider at a terrible volume and pitch. The crack under its shell exploded, ichor and viscera tumbling out. It gave one last ear-shattering roar. The ground shook. Then everything went red.
  

  

  
Tasmyne woke with soft grass against her cheek. She was lying in the glade where Edelweiss's body rested. But the priestess wasn't just a dead body anymore. Edelweiss was sitting up, her face flushed with healthy color and all her wounds healed. The depression where she had lain was filling with the tiny white flowers, blooming before their very eyes. All around them, their other friends were waking. When Lorelei saw her sister, she burst into tears of joy. The two women held each other, laughing and crying, for several minutes. 
  

  
No one spoke. They had traveled to another plane and defeated an alien monster. They had saved a town, possibly a whole kingdom, from a serious danger. And most importantly, they had rescued someone special, and the world was a little bit more whole.
