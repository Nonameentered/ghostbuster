Mac reached a dead end. They'd been hoping for a door, but there were only train tracks disappearing into a dark tunnel, and a ventilation grate high up on one wall. The mob was catching up. Mac had to choose.
  

  
A padlock held the grate shut. Standing on tiptoe, Mac tried the keys, and the smallest one fit into it. They swung the grate open and pulled themselves up. As they did, they reshaped themselves again, this time into Ace. Ace was five-foot-nothing, rail-thin, and double-jointed. If anyone could fit in the ventilation shaft, it was Ace.
  

  
Ace squeezed inside and waited. Five people pounded down the hall and skidded to a stop. 
  

  
“Where'd that freak go?” one of them growled. He had a wide mouth with too many pointed teeth, and had no business calling anyone else a freak. 
  

  
“They've got the Keys. That means they're the new Traveler. We've got to get those Keys before they figure out how to use their powers.”
  

  
Powers? Ace wondered.
  

  
The mob rushed off down the tunnel. But the keys led Ace further into the ventilation shaft. Ace crawled along it, and emerged in a lobby. There was a man there, dressed like a cab driver and holding a sign that read “Traveler.” He had Cam's luggage.
  

  
“Ah, there you are,” the man said. “All this must seem very strange to you.”
  

  
“Not that strange,” Ace said, shifting back into Cam.
  

  
The man blinked in surprise. “Well. It seems you've missed your train, so I'm here to drive you to your destination. This way.” He led Cam to a taxi parked just outside. As they pulled away, the man turned and handed Cam a book. 
  

  
The the book was titled “So You're a Traveler Now: A Guide to Being the Chosen One.”
