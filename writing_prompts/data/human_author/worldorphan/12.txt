**On Holiday**

All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. My parents, for example, had five children before they realized that they didn't actually like children or have any interest in raising them. My brothers and sisters and I spent a lot of time in boarding schools. Which I suppose was a good thing. The only people we drove crazier than our parents was each other.
  

  
It was summer, and our parents were going on holiday in Catalonia, so the five of us were being shipped off to Shrewsbury to stay with our aunt and uncle. They owned a big house in the country, filled with knickknacks that we weren't allowed to touch. They say at fifty, everyone has the face he deserves. Aunt Phyllis's face was long and pinched, and always looked as if she'd just smelled something unpleasant. Uncle Stanley's face was pudgy and always smiling, despite his wife's best attempts to make him miserable.
  

  
Traveling from London to Shrewsbury meant three hours on a train. It was up to me as the oldest to make sure we all got there with minimal mischief. My sister Ruby, age eleven, wasn't too hard to manage. She would spend the entire trip with her nose in a book. Janet, age nine, and James, age eight, played cards across the table between our seats, bickering over the rules of a game they were making up as they went along. Denis, only five, sat in the corner by the window, coloring.
  

  
“I win again,” James cheered.
  

  
“You cheated!” Janet protested.
  

  
“Did not!”
  

  
“Did too!”
  

  
“Ruby, tell her I didn't cheat.”
  

  
“Hush. I'm reading.”
  

  
James poked her. “Reading is boring.”
  

  
Ruby didn't even look up from her book. “I'm imagining we're being sent to the countryside to escape the Blitz. If I get bored of that, I'll pretend I'm recently orphaned and going to live with wealthy, eccentric relatives.”
  

  
“Can I play too?” Janet asked. “We can pretend we're going to search Auntie and Uncle's house for magic gardens and secret doors to worlds with talking animals!”
  

  
Ruby shook her head. “In my imagination, I'm an only child.”
  

  
Denis had abandoned his drawing and was staring out the window, worry clouding his face. I put an arm around him. 
  

  
“Big brother? Is Auntie and Uncle's house going to be scary?”
  

  
He was too little remember the last time we'd been there. “No. It's not like home. But it's not scary.”
  

  
“It's neat!” James encouraged him. “Uncle Stanley has this room he calls his growlery. He goes in there when he's mad at Auntie Phyllis. It's full of dead animals.”
  

  
Denis looked alarmed.
  

  
“They're taxidermy,” I explained. “Stuffed with cotton and sawdust and made to look alive. But they're not.”
  

  
“There's a greenhouse with lots of pretty plants,” Janet told him helpfully.
  

  
“And we'll each get our own bedroom,” I added. “But you can sleep in mine if you want.” That got a smile out of him. 
  

  
I went back to writing in my journal. My siblings resumed their activities, too. Eventually, I got up to use the loo.
  

  
As I stepped back into our car, I could already hear the chaos that was my family. Playing cards were scattered everywhere. James and Janet had climbed onto the table and were locked in a furious tussle, as Ruby  whacked them with her novel in an attempt to get them to stop. All of them were screaming.
  

  
“Holy smokes! I was gone for five minutes!” They ignored me. More loudly, I yelled, “If you monsters don't knock it off right now, so help me, when they exhume your bodies, they'll have to put you back together like a jigsaw puzzle!” 
  

  
That got their attention. There was a moment of shocked silence. Then everyone launched into their own explanation of why none of it was their fault.
  

  
“I don't care! Sit down! And shut up!”
  

  
Janet started in with a “but--”. I gave her a withering stare, and she slumped sullenly into her seat.
  

  
“Where's Denis?”
  

  
They all looked wildly around, then returned their gazes to me.
  

  
We lost because we told ourselves we lost, I thought. So we just had to remain positive. “All right. Let's all stay together as we look.”
  

  
We searched two more passenger cars, the dining car, and the sleeper car. My siblings followed my every direction. They didn't fight or squabble. We were, for once, a team.
  

  
Finally, we found Denis hiding in the baggage car. His shirt, bright red amidst the pile of ugly brown suitcases, gave him away.
  

  
Gently, I coaxed him out. He'd gotten scared, confused overwhelmed. But like his siblings, he knew he could count on me to be there for him, no matter what. Denis trusted me. He loved Big Brother.
