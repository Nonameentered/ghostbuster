Thanks!

I think the thing I like best about writing is watching the stories grow. I often feel like they have a life of their own, and I'm just a facilitator. I like finding the right words to make them come to life.

Ellie's magic stems from her mother's magic, which I made up first. They are both actually from another story which I will write one day but right now it's a hot mess. Her mother is an oracle who learns things by talking to the wind. So I made Ellie's magic like that, but applied to more active things.

The magic of Inaltimae came from trying to find something about Mara that someone would want to hurt her over. At the time I made it up, I actually didn't know who the killer was. The week's theme was dissonance, so I thought about how dissonant sounds could fuel destructive magic. And then I thought about what the opposite would be and how a person might do both. The idea of putting elemental magic in crystals so anybody could use it kind of grew out of that.
