**Not Bad for a Tuesday**

It was a Tuesday night in September, and I was where I always was after the sun went down: in the cemetery. A warm breeze carried the floral scent of bouquets left for  the dearly departed, along with the odor of freshly turned earth and the faint smell of rot. A full moon lit up the night and drew out weird shadows from the the stones and statues. I sat with my back against a large marble angel, watching for trouble. And working diligently on my algebra homework like a good girl. Definitely not browsing social media on my phone.

I heard a moaning and a shuffling of feet. A zombie staggered into view, shredded clothes and rotten flesh hanging off its lanky frame. I sprang to my feet and rushed it. With a quick swing of my ax, I severed one of its arms, and two more swings took off its head, which rolled along the ground. The eyes turned to glare at me for a minute, before going glassy.

On the far side of the lawn, movement caught my eye. I turned, expecting another undead, but instead I recognized a boy from school. Ethan. On the basketball team and the honor roll, he was super hot and way out of my league. Why was he here? It was too late to hope he hadn't seen me, but with any luck, he hadn't seen much.

I kicked Mr. Zombie behind a bush and strode toward Ethan, trying to act casual. Butterflies squirmed in my stomach.

“Oh, hi! How – what doing – you – um.” I jargogled my words. Fighting monsters, I was cool as a cucumber, but talking to boys was much harder.

“Hi,” he replied smoothly. “Alexis, right? We have Spanish together.”

“Yeah. And obviously I know who you are.” I felt my cheeks flush crimson. Wow, that sounded really cringey.

“So what are you doing here?” he asked me.

I wracked my brain for an explanation. “Oh, I've just come to visit my grandmother's grave. I do that when I'm stressed.”

“It's so late, though.”

“Well, uh, I'm extra stressed tonight. It's this math test.”

He nodded as if he understood perfectly. Just then, I heard a the crumbling of earth at my feet. A long-fingered hand was digging its way out of the grave I was standing on. *Not now!* I thought, stomping on it.

“So, what are *you* doing here?” I asked Ethan.

“I was here earlier, working on a history project, and I lost something.”

I needed to get Ethan out of there. “What was it? Can I help you look for it?” I started to lead him away. Suddenly, the ground erupted, and a monstrous figure hurled itself upward.

“Look out!” Ethan shouted, dragging me back. Then he pulled a crossbow out of his jacket and fired it at the creature. The thing hissed as the bolt sunk into its shoulder.

I gaped at Ethan “Looking for something, huh? Your truths are worse than your lies.” I stepped past him, swinging my ax, but the ghoul dodged it. Long-limbed and emaciated, with white skin, nasty claws, and way too many teeth, this wasn't any ordinary zombie.

“Hah. You're one to talk. Visiting your grandma's grave? Really?” The ghoul charged him, and he rolled away, firing again. The shot went wide. “What order are you with?”

“The Hand of Persephone,” I answered, circling the ghoul slowly. “You?”

“The Knights of the Shield and Star.”

The creature lunged at me with its claws, and I hopped backwards. My foot slid on some gravel. Ethan caught me. For a moment I hung there, in his arms, feeling the hard muscles of his chest, his eyes locked on mine. All I could think of was how much I wanted him to kiss me. We all go a little mad sometimes.

He let me go. “I bet you have some kind of chosen-one origin story, huh?”

“I received a vision from my grandmother on her deathbed. You?” I slashed at the ghoul as it pounced again, drawing black, viscous blood.

“Nothing so dramatic. I was recruited by my uncle.”

The monster's full attention was on me as I pressed the attack. Taking advantage of this, Ethan sidestepped and fired. The bolt struck the ghoul right between the eyes. I hacked off its head as it collapsed.

We stood there a minute, catching our breath. Ethan brushed sweaty hair out of his face. He grinned at me. “You were pretty amazing just now.”

“Thanks. You too.”

“Are you coming to the game on Friday?”

I hadn't planned on it, but I guess I was now. “Sure.”

“Want to get coffee after the game?”

“I'd like that.”

One dead ghoul. One hot date. Not bad for a Tuesday.
