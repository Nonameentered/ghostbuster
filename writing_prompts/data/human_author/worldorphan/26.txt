**Ballad for a Battle**
  

  
“Well, at least we don't have to go to class,” Osman said, uncorking a wine bottle. The four of them were languishing in their dormitory common room at the Mage's college. The city of Aurimore, and a significant portion of the surrounding kingdom of Praedal, was under a curse that suppressed all magic. So there was very little for the students to do.
  

  
“Put that bottle away,” Sabrina scolded. “It's too early for drinking.”
  

  
“Ha. Too early for you, maybe.”
  

  
Hyacinth groaned. “I'm so bored. I think I would rather be in class.”
  

  
Ignoring her quibbling friends, Crestia retreated to her room and perched on the windowsill, staring out at the gray sky. While all four classmates were from affluent families, her friends' parents and relatives were all statesmen, merchants, or master-craftsman. Crestia's father, however, was a general in the royal army. He was, at that moment, leading his unit in the siege on the wizard Ezruvas's tower. She was worried sick about him.
  

  
The magic-blocking curse had begun a week ago. Ezruvas had sent a message to the King of Praedal, demanding demanding the Wand of Dragon-Control sealed in the royal vault. It was the ruler of Preadal's sacred duty to protect the wand, thus ensuring peace with the Dragon Kingdom. So they couldn't just give it to Ezruvas, who might use it for nefarious purposes besides.
  

  
But neither could their kingdom function for long without magic. Already bridges and buildings with architecture supported by enchantments were failing, as were the spells that kept the city's water supply pure and its food stores fresh. They would have no weather control during harvest season and no magical heating in the dead of winter. And without magic they could scarcely protect themselves from the beasts and undead that prowled the countryside.
  

  
The royal army was highly motivated to defeat the wizard and end his curse at any cost. But they had been trained to fight with magic, and without it there was little they could do against him. At best, they would fail. At worst, they would all die. Including her father.
  

  
Crestia pulled her flute from a drawer, put it to her lips, and pensively began to play. Her fingers drifted absently through familiar tunes, slow, sad music to match her mood. It was so dreary outdoors and in. She wished it were warmer, brighter. She longed for something to burn away the pall that had settled around everything, something to create a spark of hope.
  

  
Then she felt something she hadn't felt in days. It was there, where it had always been, just as it had always been. Like a glimmer in the corner of her eye, like a sound just out of earshot, like a taste you couldn't put a name to. Magic. She reached for it, but it slipped through her grasp, leaving her feeling numb. She sighed and went back to her music. As soon as the first note left her flute, she sensed the magic again. It was there when she played, gone when she didn't. She played a middle C and held it, then reached for the magic. That time, she almost caught it. She tried an arpeggio, ending in a strong vibrato note, and at last, the sound wrapped around the magic and shaped it to her will. Above her head, a ball of flame swelled into being, filling the room with a warm golden light.
  

  
“Whoa!” Osman cried. 
  

  
Crestia turned to find her friends staring from the doorway. As soon as the flute left her lips, the flame flickered out, returning the room to shadow.
  

  
Hyacinth laughed with delight. “Do it again!”
  

  
One of the reasons that the four of them were friends was that they were all musically inclined. It was the common ground that bound together their otherwise disparate personalities.
  

  
Crestia described what she had done, and the others listened, striving to make sense of it. Sabrina hummed the opening bars of her favorite opera after several tries, she was able to levitate Crestia's jewelry box. Osman and Hyacinth scrambled to their dorm rooms to get their instruments, a drum and a violin, and soon the four of them were experimenting and comparing notes, determined to learn as much as possible about this new form of magic they had discovered.
  

  
Hyacinth, ever scholarly and over-achieving, composed their findings into a short dissertation. Then they marched down to the Dean's office. 
  

  
“Dean Thassodrim is unavailable,” Professor Inyll informed them. “I can take your document, but I do not anticipate that he will be free to read it any time soon. He and a collection of other teachers and academics are in a meeting to determine a solution to our magical predicament.”
  

  
“But that's what this is about!” Osman protested. We've found a way to subvert the curse and use magic.”
  

  
Inyll, who was an adjunct, not even a tenured professor, raised a skeptical eyebrow. He took the slim folder from Hyacinth and pawed through it. “Rubbish. This violates a number of arcane theories. It could never work.”
  

  
“But it does work!” Crestia insisted. 
  

  
“Please stop wasting my time. Your betters have real work to do. Go get drunk with the rest of your little friends.”
  

  
Hyacinth looked like she wanted to tackle the haughty functionary, but Osman and Crestia held her back.
  

  
“Come on,” Crestia said. “If they won't listen, then it's up to us to do what we can.”
