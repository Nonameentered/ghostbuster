**Fog** 
  

  
It was a damp, foggy autumn morning as I hiked down the road. Dad always made fun of me for walking from our house into town, “in this modern day and age”, as he said it. But I liked the stillness, just me and nature. 
  

  
All this was going to change soon. After the wedding, Derek and I would leave this little town for the city. There would be no more walks down country roads.
  

  
My thoughts kept drifting back to last night's dinner conversation. Mom and grandma kept heaping advice on me about how to be a good wife. Although grandma's advice was mostly to have lots of children as soon as possible. I didn't even know if I wanted kids. Derek and I hadn't really talked about it. He knew I didn't like talking about the future. 
  

  
My brother made some lewd comment about Derek and I being intimate. The truth was, we hadn't yet. I was glad we were waiting. I loved him. I wanted to share everything with him, including that. But I knew once I lost my virginity, I would never be the same. 
  

  
My father always says change is inevitable. I think that's part of why it scares me so much.
  

  
On my walk to town I always take a shortcut through the Garners' east pasture.  This morning though, it was so heavily blanketed with fog that I couldn't even see the big oak tree in the middle. Still, besides the tree, there was nothing in the field that I might blunder into accidentally, and I'd end up on the road on the other side eventually.
  

  
I stepped off the road, wet grass soaking through my shoes. The fog settled around me, thicker and thicker as I went, until I could hardly see two feet in front of me. But I pressed ahead, reminding myself it was impossible to get lost in an empty field.
  

  
After a few more minutes, I began to grow uneasy. I felt I should have come to the other side already. Had I somehow turned at a right angle? Even if that were the case, I should have reached the trees that lined either side of the field. I couldn't be going in circles, could I?
  

  
I had a feeling of being in an impossible space, an expanse of nothing that went on forever. Suddenly, a spot of color in the enveloping gray caught my eye. It was a single yellow flower, a black-eyed Susan. As I took a step towards it, an inexplicable feeling of dread washed over me. I shook myself. I was being ridiculous. It was just a flower. I bent to touch it.
  

  
As my fingers brushed the petals, they shuddered, twisted, and warped. I jerked my hand back. I told myself I was imagining things. I touched it again. The petals flared out, became huge, then tiny. They became feathers, became thorns, became tentacles reaching out and wrapping around my wrist. The black center of the flower opened to reveal a blinking eye. Then it shut itself and sunk inward, like a miniature black hole. 
  

  
Then my fingers began to warp. I was struck with a sudden, violent sense of wrongness, like intense nausea without the release of actually throwing up. I felt not an urge, but a pressure to change. To let my body warp and twist like the flower. It was a violation of the order of nature.
  

  
“No!” I yelled. 
  

  
As if acquiescing to my refusal, the strange sensation withdrew from me. I stumbled backwards. Around me, the mist seemed to withdraw. I could see the big oak, and the trees that lined the field. They, too, were warping, changing, becoming things they ought not to be. Spires, mountains, animals, gates, stones, human figures with their hands raised into the air.
  

  
I sobbed at the wrongness of it all.
  

  
Then a forbidden thought entered my mind. What if it wasn't wrong? This force all around me, changing everything around me, was something we were not meant to understand. But it existed all the same. The future was unknowable, after all. What if this had always been meant to happen?
  

  
The force I had felt before pushed upon my mind, buzzing, coaxing, cajoling, demanding. How could I say no? 
  

  
If I let it take me, I would never see my fiance again. Or my family, or my home. But I was going to lose all those things anyway, in the relentless march of time. My life would never be the same from one moment to the other, no matter how tightly I clung to the familiar. 
  

  
So I let it in. I let it twist me, warp me, change me, make me into something else, something other. Something new.
  

  
Change, after all, is inevitable.
