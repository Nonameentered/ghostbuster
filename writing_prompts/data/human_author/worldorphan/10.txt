**Missed Connection**
  

  
It was a wrong number that started it, the telephone ringing three times in the dead of night, and the voice on the other end asking for someone he was not.
  

  
*“Michael?”* said a woman's voice.
  

  
“Sorry. There's no Michael here,” Kyle told her.
  

  
*“I have to talk to Michael!”* She started sobbing. He didn't know what to say. *“Sorry to have bothered you,”* she managed finally, before hanging up.
  

  
He stared at the phone for a minute before hanging back on the wall. It shouldn't have been ringing in the first place. He'd only moved into this house a month ago, and he had never connected the land line. He'd bought the house from an elderly lady who had lived there for thirty years before moving into a nursing home. Maybe her phone account was still active.
  

  
Two nights later, Kyle was awakened by rhythmic clicking and dinging noises. It wasn't loud, but it was so unfamiliar that it pulled him from sleep. He followed the sound to an old manual typewriter he'd found in the attic. The old lady had told him she'd never been up there, so it would have belonged to the people who owned the house before her.
  

  
Kyle had liked the look of the antique typewriter, and put it on a shelf in his office. And now, it's keys were moving by themselves, filling the yellowing paper with words. Curious, he pulled off the page and read.
  

  
*Dear Cindy,*
  

  
*These may be my last words to you. We both knew everything could change at any moment, suddenly and forever. But I never guessed it would be so soon. I wish you could be here, with me, but I understand why you can't, and I forgive you. No matter what happens, my love for you will live forever.*
  

  
Kyle pinched himself, but he wasn't dreaming. With no idea what to make of any of it, he laid the letter on his desk and went back to bed.
  

  
The next night, it was the phone again.
  

  
*“Michael? Just listen. Your mom called and told me the news. Oh, Michael! I'm so sorry! I never should have gone on this trip. Now I might not be there when . . . I'm going to do everything in my power to get back to you, do you hear me? I love you so much.”* 
  

  
The phone call ended in static.
  

  
A search of the county records revealed that Kyle's house had originally belonged to a Michael Thompson. More searching uncovered Michael Thompson's obituary. He had died of brain cancer thirty years prior. In three days, it would be the anniversary of his death. He also found an engagement notice, for Michael Thompson and Cynthia “Cindy” Manning. Then Kyle found Cindy's obituary. She had died in a car crash, during a snowstorm outside of Denver, Colorado, just one day before Michael.
  

  
Two days later, Kyle found another letter on the typewriter. The night after that, the phone rang again.
  

  
*“Michael? I'm gonna make it home, I promise. There's a really bad snow storm here. All the planes are grounded. But my rental car has four-wheel drive. It's a twenty-four hour drive from Denver back to Columbia. That's how long you've got to hold on, so I can say goodbye.”*
  

  
“I'm sorry Cindy. Michael's not here. But he left you a letter. Just let me read it to you, please?”
  

  
*Dear Cindy,*
  

  
*I heard the message you left on my machine, and I know you will do your best to get home before I'm gone. I want very badly to say goodbye in person, too. But please know that if you don't make it in time, it's okay. I don't need to be face to face with you to know you love me. In fact, it might be better that you are not here. The pressure from the brain tumor has affected my motor functions. I can barely care for myself. Between the adult diapers and all the antiseptic Mom insists on, it's not a fragrant world around here. Joking aside, I know how much that business conference meant to you. I hope you'll always pursue your dreams, with or without me. I love you. Now and always.*

*Michael*
  

  
On the phone, Cindy sobbed. *“Thank you. Thank you,”* she said over and over again. Then the phone went dead. No static. Nothing. Kyle looked at the letter in his hand. The paper was blank.
  

  
He thought about all of the people in his life that had passed on, and he felt a stab of jealousy toward Michael and Cindy and the second chance they had been given. After all, his loved ones were not ghosts. They were simply gone. No way has yet been invented to say goodbye to them.
