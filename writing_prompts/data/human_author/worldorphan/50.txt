**A Hall of Doors Christmas**
  

  
Ellie Windborn shuffled through her tarot deck until she found the card she wanted, the Page of Wands. It depicted a blonde boy with his hand at his mouth as if he was yelling some important news. 
  

  
She held the card against her closet door and knocked. This was the special code she shared with her family. They each had their own tarot card. Toby's was the Page of Wands, hers was The Star, and the Watcher, the Keeper of the Hall of Doors and their adoptive grandfather, his was The Hermit. She had already tried summoning him, but of course he was too busy.
  

  
Less than a minute after she knocked, the door opened. A little boy, who looked very much like the picture on his tarot card, burst out and wrapped his arms around her in a huge hug.
  

  
"Ellie! I missed you!"
  

  
"You live in the Hall of Doors. You can't even feel the passage of time in there, really."
  

  
"I still missed you." He looked around her tiny, sparsely furnished apartment. "Is this where you live now?"
  

  
Ellie was sixteen years old, and had been for centuries. She was half Faerie, after all. Since her original world had fractured, she'd mostly lived a nomadic life, wandering from one world to another, but calling none of them home. A week ago, she'd gone through a portal with no plan in mind, and emerged in Round Earth, in Iowa, at Christmas-time. 
  

  
“Yes,” Ellie answered him finally. “But we're not staying here. We're going out. Change into something warm. It's cold outside.”
  

  
Toby snapped his fingers, and the silk tunic and trousers he was wearing morphed into a snowsuit. He gave her a curious look, and she grinned. The world outside her apartment was covered in deep white drifts. Toby leaped into them, sinking up to his knees, and laughed in delight. 
  

  
“C'mon! I'll show you what the children of Round Earth do with snow.” The two of them made snowmen and snow angels and had snowball fights until their fingers ached with cold.
  

  
Ellie led them to a park a few blocks away, where they bought styrofoam cups of hot chocolate from a lady in a kiosk.
  

  
“What's that for?” Toby asked, pointing to a raised stone fire-pit, with a fire blazing inside.
  

  
“You're gonna love this.” Ellie reached into the paper sack she'd bought along with the hot chocolate, and pulled out a couple of marshmallows.
  

  
“They're so squishy!”
  

  
“Don't eat them yet!” Ellie put the marshmallows on wooden skewers and held them over the flames. Toby made awed noises.
  

  
Ellie cursed as the marshmallows caught on fire. She hastily blew them out. Their outsides were black and crackling.
  

  
Toby saw her dismay. “It's okay. An accident isn't always a bad thing.”
  

  
“It is when you ruin perfectly good marshmallows.”
  

  
“I bet they're still good.” He reached for them.
  

  
“Wait,” she said again. Ellie pulled graham crackers and chocolate out of the paper sack, and made Toby a s'more. He devoured it with the passion of a child experiencing something wonderful for the first time.
  

  
They cooked the rest of the s'mores, then went for a walk through the park. A giant fir tree stood at one end, decked out in lights and ornaments. A group of carolers performed beside it.
  

  
Toby asked, “What's all this for?”
  

  
“It's called Christmas,” Ellie answered. “It's a winter solstice festival, and also a religious festival celebrating the birth of a savior. And people give each other presents. The people in this part of Round Earth are pretty obsessed with it.”
  

  
“I like it. Everybody seems so happy.”
  

  
“Yeah. Sometimes I see how the people of the Many Worlds struggle and suffer, and are never satisfied with their lives. I'm guilty of it, too. Then I find a place and time like this one, and I remember how to be happy.” She took his hand. “Let's go back to the apartment. I got you a present.”
  

  
Just then, a spot of color on a park bench caught her attention. It was a tarot card, the Ten of Cups. On it, a couple stood with their arms around each other, with two children playing beside them. A rainbow filled the top of the scene. Ellie picked it up. There was no question it had come from the Watcher's tarot deck. He was always leaving tarot cards for people to find, another of his special codes, subtle hints to tell people about their futures or what was important. A warm grin spread across Ellie's face as she looked at the happy family on the card. Their grandfather was thinking of them after all. 
  

  
It was a perfect Christmas.
