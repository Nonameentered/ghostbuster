**The Guardian**

Yarrow woke. A terrible windstorm shook the farmhouse, followed by an enormous crash. She left her straw pallet and ventured outside, her parents asleep and oblivious. The ancient oak tree in the west pasture, the Hero's Tree, had blown over. Moonlight caught on something inside the hole where it's roots had been.

It was a sword. There had been a mighty battle in this area, a century ago. While plowing they'd often unearthed rusted bits of weapons and armor. This sword, however, gleamed like new. It felt warm in her hand. It felt like it was meant for her.

\--------------------------------------------

There wasn't much left after the demons attacked, big dog-like things with scaly skin and skeletal faces. Yarrow's parents had told her to run for town, for help, but the town had been attacked too. Thankfully most of the women and children had escaped, but nearly everyone who'd tried to fight had perished. Including Yarrow's parents.

Weeping in the ruins of her farm, Yarrow heard a popping sound. Suddenly, a woman appeared in the ring of mushrooms beside the well. Tall and athletic, she had the darkest skin of anyone Yarrow had ever seen. She wore a form-fitting black  leather outfit, a brightly patterned sash, and a pair of swords. Her ears were pointed.

She nodded to Yarrow, then strode over to the corpse of a demon.  “I don't know much cryptozoology,” she said, “but this creature isn't from this world. It was summoned.”

“Crypto-what?”

“I'm sorry I was too late to stop the attack. I only hope Danavar didn't find what he was looking for.”

“Who are you?”

“Ishumi of the Guardians of Aster, warriors who travel between worlds. Did you know your world was just one of many? I'm pursuing a sorcerer. He's come to this world in search of an artifact, a powerful weapon. It can cut through nearly any magical spell or barrier."

"Something like this?" Yarrow showed her the sword she'd found.

Ishumi looked slowly from the blade to Yarrow. "How old are you, girl?"

"Sixteen."

"This artifact has chosen you. That's why Danavar's spell couldn't locate it. But he'll find other spells, and he'll be back. Would you stand and fight?"

"Yes, if it means fighting the man who killed my parents."

"Well, you're pugnacious enough." She smiled wryly. "Cue the training montage."

\--------------------------------------------

Danavar did return, stepping through a portal that appeared in the farmhouse door, a horde of demons with him.  He was short, pale, and weaselly, in strange red robes.

“Ishumi,” he sneered. “This will be too easy. Why don't you just give me the sword now?”

“No.” It was Yarrow who spoke.

Danavar laughed. “This is the sword's chosen master? Pathetic!” He raised his hand, and the demons charged. Ishumi met them, a blur of blades and flashing spells, demons dropping like flies. Yarrow, too, killed a dozen of the creatures that had slaughtered her family and friends.

Danavar summoned demons as fast as they could kill them. Ishumi maneuvered across the field, to the ring of ashes she'd laid beforehand. Encircling the farm, it was large enough Danavar wouldn't notice he was inside a trap until after it had been sprung. Ishumi touched the circle, and the air hummed as a barrier arose.

“He's in zugzwang now,” Ishumi panted, killing the last of the demons as Yarrow joined her. “Can't retreat, can't summon more creatures. Your sword's the only way through that barrier. He has to make a move, and that means risking himself.”

Danavar seemed to realize this, too. He began relentlessly hurling spells at Yarrow. With her magic sword, she parried the first, the second, the third. But the fourth hit its mark. She crumpled, screaming. She'd never been boiled alive in a teacup before, but she imagined it was like this, trapped in a shrinking, scalding bubble.

Ishumi charged the sorcerer, dodging and countering spells. He had a magical shield around him that her swords couldn't penetrate. All she was doing was buying Yarrow time.

Pushing through the pain, Yarrow forced her blade to touch the spell encasing her. Suddenly, she was free. She rushed at Danavar, her sword slicing through his protections and striking him down.

Ishumi made a quick gesture and bound Danavar with magic.

“Will he die?” Yarrow asked.

“No. I've closed his wound. He'll stand trial for his crimes.” After dispelling the barrier, Ishumi hefted Danaver over her shoulder and stepped into the mushroom ring.

Yarrow's quandary lasted only moments. She called, “take me with you!”

“You want to join the Guardians of Aster? It'll be dangerous. But I think you've got what it takes.”

Yarrow took a deep breath before her leap of faith, then joined Ishumi in the portal.
