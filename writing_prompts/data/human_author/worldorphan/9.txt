**Home for the Summer**
  

  
“I am a camera with its shutter open, quite passive, recording, not thinking.” 
  

  
I repeated this mantra silently to calm myself, just like my trainer told me, focusing on the events around me without getting emotional. It was extremely important for a powered individual like myself to stay in control.
  

  
Mom wasn't making it easy, though. I hadn't even unpacked my suitcase, and she was already assaulting me with a list of rules. Most of which boiled down to just one: don't use my powers.
  

  
To put it simply, I could make portals. A hole opens up in one place, someone or something goes into it, and comes out of a second hole somewhere else. When it first started two years ago, the portals opened up at random when I was stressed. In the middle of a fight about my curfew after the Homecoming dance, I accidentally made a portal under her favorite angel figurine and dropped it from eight feet up. I swear it wasn't on purpose.
  

  
Family dinner was awful. In my time away from home, everything that had happened to me had been amazing and surprising. But every time I tried to talk about my training, or my work with the Midwest Powered Youth Regiment, Mom changed the subject.
  

  
“You should get a summer job, Zoey,” she said. “The Sanders boy works at the movie theater. Maybe he can put in a good word for you. He's pretty cute, right?” It was all I could do not to cringe.
  

  
After dinner, I flopped onto my bed. I missed the Superpowers Training Center in Indiana, the Urban Guardian Camp in Chicago, even the airbnb we stayed at on our sojourn to the Nevada desert. I was homesick for anywhere but here. 
  

  
My little brother Caleb came in and pummeled me with questions. I hoped if I answered a few he'd go away. No, I couldn't make a portal to New York. My limit was half a mile. No, you couldn't get stuck in my portals. No, I couldn't cut people in half with portals, or transport someone's heart out of their body. What's wrong with that kid? Yes, I could take him with me through a portal, but Mom would murder us, so no, not gonna happen. I'd nearly forgotten how annoying he was, and how much I loved him.
  

  
Caleb and I took our dog, Mikey, for a walk. Our little Houdini slipped his leash and bolted. By the time we spotted him, he was in Mr. McAmos's yard, lifting his leg to urinate on that ugly sundial. Without hesitation, I opened a portal under Mikey and dropped him, stream of pee and all, onto our sidewalk.

“I saw that!” Mr. McAmos hollered, sticking his head out a window and waving a fist at me. A cigarette dangled from his permanently scowling mouth. “Keep that damned dog and your freak powers off my lawn!”
  

  
“You shouldn't smoke indoors, Mr. McAmos,” I yelled back.
  

  
“Zoey Gloria Milton! How dare you?” Mom had materialized behind us. She rushed over to Mikey and started looking him over, as if I might have injured him. I opened my mouth, but nothing came out. Then I stomped up to my room and slammed the door.
  

  
A few days later, Mom, Caleb, and I were hanging out in the back yard after dinner, when I smelled smoke. I looked around, but I didn't see anything. Danger sense was a common secondary power, so when I got goosebumps, I always followed my instincts. I hopped into a portal and dropped myself onto our roof.
  

  
“Zoey!” Mom shrieked. “Get down from there this instant!”
  

  
I ignored her. From my new vantage, I could see thick smoke pouring from an upstairs window of Mr. McAmos's house. “Mom, call 911!” I portaled myself into his yard. Through the front window, I picked a safe space in the living room and popped inside. The ceiling was choked with black smoke.
  

  
“Mr. McAmos?” I heard coughing from upstairs. I took a deep breath and portaled to the upper landing. The air was scalding, and I could barely see. He huddled in the corner of his bedroom, raging flames forming a wall between him and the door. A portal took me to his side. A second portal dropped us both onto his lawn, just as the fire truck came wailing into our neighborhood.
  

  
As the firemen went to work on the burning house, I heard Mr. McAmos griping about “freak powers” and needing to get checked for radiation poisoning. Ungrateful curmudgeon. 
  

  
Mom arrived, pride and fury vying for dominance on her face. She was just going to have to sort that out for herself. I turned away from the flashing red lights and hurried to my house.
