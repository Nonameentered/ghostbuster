City Dog, Faerie Country


There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. That's what Angela said. She was my human, and she was the best human ever, but that day she wanted to keep us unfairly cooped up indoors. It was a rainy, dreary day, but it wasn't raining just then. 

"No, Roxy," she said as I brought her my leash again. "We'll get halfway to the park, and it'll start pouring again."

My whole body quivered at the word 'park'.

"No. No park. Sorry, girl," she said, scratching my fluffy, floppy ears. "I don't have time for a long walk today. I've got to finish this essay for my history professor"

Walk or no walk, I really needed to go out, so I went to the door and whined.

"Okay, but just for a minute." She clipped on my leash. Angela stood on the porch of our townhouse while I did my business. I was just finishing when I smelled something. It wasn't a squirrel; it wasn't a possum, either. It was a rich, earthy, wild scent, and it was wholly new to me. I started barking, to let Angela know I had found something important. And maybe to flush out whatever I had found. 

It was in the bushes. At first I mistook it for a cat: triangular ears, silvery fur, and a long tail. But it turned toward me, and I saw that it's face was like a human's, and it walked on two legs. It was no bigger than a doll.

I barked again, and it bolted from the bush. I couldn't just let something like that get away. I was usually a well-behaved dog, so when I lept after it, I took Angela by surprise. Jerked forward without warning, she toppled off the porch into the flowerbed. I felt a little guilty. But she was unhurt, and she'd let go of my leash when she fell. I was free to run, so I did.

“Roxy, come back!” Angela yelled as she chased after me. I followed the little creature down an alley and into the next street. I cornered it beside a set of stairs. Angela caught up to me and grabbed my leash again. When I turned to glance at her, the little creature made its escape. But I could tell from the look of wonder on Angela's face that she had seen it, too.

I took off again, following its scent, and Angela let me. It led us out of our neighborhood, past the shops on Olive street, and across the park. It was covering ground less quickly now, darting from hiding place to hiding place. 

The bad weather had left the streets mostly deserted. The wind sounded of Mother Earth's forsaken and abandoned cries. It blew between buildings, cars and dumpsters when, I could tell, it wanted to be blowing between trees and over open fields. It carried with it all the ugly smells that humans made: car exhaust, cigarette smoke, and rotting food.

The creature went into the woods on the far side of the park. I bounded happily through the deep carpet of leaves. I should have looked twice before I leaped, because I got my leg stuck in a half-buried bicycle wheel. The woods were full of junk that humans had dumped there when no one was looking. 

We crossed a stream, and found ourselves in a sapling grove, dappled with hazy yellow-green light. Among the branches perched a dozen tiny owls. They clicked their beaks at us in warning, little feathered sentinels. I wondered if they would scatter if I barked at them, like pigeons. But I didn't. There was something reverent about that place, a stillness that had never known violence.

Beyond the grove, the forest became denser. There had been an orchard here, long ago. The trees were ancient and immense, their crowns weaving together, a mosaic of apples, pears, mulberries and walnuts.

Everywhere, from the forest floor to the treetops, tiny, strange creatures watched us. Things like squirrels, rabbits, birds, and butterflies, but with human-like arms and legs and faces. 

I knew things, then, that a domesticated mutt shouldn't be smart enough to know. I knew that magic was just a pseudonym for secrets and truth and the way the world was meant to be if people could just stop ruining it. I sensed that Angela knew too.

We stayed there for a long time. But finally I saw a glow between the trees ahead. I tugged Angela toward it, and we emerged onto Granite Street, on the far side of the woods. The creatures' home was not a place we belonged. In the deep glens where they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery.
