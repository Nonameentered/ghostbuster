**Samhain Fires**

&#x200B;

The door hadn't been there yesterday. The two stones leaning against each other in a triangular arch had always been there. They sat on the beach just above the high tide line, under a morose, gray October sky. But the triangular iron door was new.
  

  
My best friend Jamie had just moved away. My parents were on the verge of divorce. I was feeling trapped in my life; a door to somewhere else, some escape, was compelling.
  

  
I pushed the door open, releasing a wave of hot air. The world on the other side was just like my own, but colored with a red filter. The ocean waves were like liquid fire. The sky glowed rosily, and the clouds burned. The only thing missing was the moon. It was a new moon, the same as it was on the beach I had just left.
  

  
A bird landed beside me, an archaeopteryx, that extinct bird-dinosaur hybrid. Sparks flew as it shook its wings. Some landed on my hand, leaving a second-degree burn.
  

  
Suddenly, I'd had enough. I backpedaled across the sand and through the rock doorway. The door disappeared as I pushed it closed.
  

  
I went home. I wanted to tell someone about the door and the place beyond it. But any conversation with my parents would devolve into fighting and blaming. I thought about calling Jamie, but she was in Boston with her new friends. So I did my homework, and went to bed.
  

  
I dreamed of fire. People in old-fashioned clothes danced around bonfires, frost-covered leaves crunching underfoot. Stray sparks caught in dry branches, and the woods around them went up in a blazing forest fire.
  

  
When I woke, I saw that large sections of my pajamas and bed-sheets were brown and crunchy, like they'd been burned.
  

  
At school, I worried that somehow everyone would know I had left the realm of normal. Jamie had always been my camouflage whenever I felt self-conscious. Now, alone, I felt like a freak. By fourth period, I could barely pay attention as my chemistry teacher lectured on triturating compounds. I thought about my dream, and I wished I had a bonfire to cut through the dark, cold swirl inside me.
  

  
I smelled smoke. My textbook was on fire. I slammed it shut. Everyone was staring at me. I bolted from the classroom, from the school, through the parking lot, and down the road.
  

  
As I ran, flames blossomed under my skin, trying to escape. Although it scared me, I wanted that fire. Burning was better than drowning in all the sadness and frustration that had taken over my life. Better than freezing in the void where my happiness used to me. 
  

  
My feet hit sand. I'd reached the beach. I spied a ruined wooden shack that had once been a Penguin Ice Cream stand, and ducked inside. It was as if I begged this place to let me burn, and it whispered, “burn away.” 
  

  
I let the flames burst out of my pores, twist through my hair. My blood was fire. My eyes were fire. My voice was fire as I screamed in terror, pain, release, ecstasy. I was a girl made of flame. I wanted to burn the whole world. But I would start with this shack. I laughed until I cried, and my tears were fire, too.
  

  
I don't know how long I sat there, sobbing as the shack burned down around me. But presently I heard a door creak open, and footsteps approach. A little old man with a long white beard and round spectacles stood amid the flames, untouched. He smiled at me.
  

  
“What's happening to me?” I asked.
  

  
“Syzygy,” he answered. “At the new moon the earth, moon, and sun align, pulling on the tides. Pulling on doors that are usually hard to open. And it's almost Samhain. Halloween. A time when this world is in syzygy with other worlds, and doors are easier to find.” He gently pulled me to my feet. “You went through a door, and something got inside you.”
  

  
“Can I put it back?”
  

  
The old man gestured, and there was the triangular door. I went through into the fiery world. A penguin screeched a greeting, waddling out of its eponymous ice-cream hut. I followed it into the ocean. The waves looked like lava, but they felt cool. They washed the fire away, leaving human skin behind. 
  

  
“Do I have to give back all of it?” I asked the penguin. 
  

  
The old man was waiting for me when I returned. “During Samhain,” he told me, “people used to light bonfires, symbolic for keeping them warm and safe through the darkest, coldest parts of winter.”
  

  
I nodded, feeling the tiny flame still burning in my chest. Now I could make it through my dark times, too.
