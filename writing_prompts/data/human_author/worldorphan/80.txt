Nightmares. Grandfather had plenty of those, toward the end, ordinary things warping into something terrifying. If his paintings had been an extension of his dreams . . . 
  

  
Carmen gathered all the figurines she could find. Then she searched the lighthouse. In an upper room, she found another art studio, a half-finished canvas on the easel. It depicted the lighthouse in the bottom corner, with the beach and ocean filling the remaining space. The sand was black, and it showed misshapen blobs, the statuettes, scattered around the beach. In the ocean, too, he'd painted something. Carmen thought maybe it had started as a pod of dolphins, but as his shaky brush strokes overlapped, it had become a single tentacled horror. 
  

  
Carmen looked out the window, scanning the waves for the creature. Instead, she saw drag marks on the beach. A squelching sound behind her made her turn, just in time to dodge a massive tentacle thrusting through the doorway. She ran for the stairs, grabbing the painting and a can of paint thinner. As a last resort, she could destroy it . . . 
  

  
The lighthouse's lamp was completely covered with the same black slime as the statuettes. Carmen had to act quickly. Tentacles were wriggling up the stairs. She pried open the paint thinner, and instead of pouring it on the painting, she flung it at the lamp. The sludge washed away, and light – brilliant, warm, purifying light – flooded over everything. The monster was completely obliterated. Outside, the sand turned white, and the waves glittered with gold.
  

  
Carmen held the painting of her Grandfather's room, and instantly found herself back there. She cleaned off the statuettes with more paint thinner. They were just chess pieces. She packed them away. She was going to miss the old man.
