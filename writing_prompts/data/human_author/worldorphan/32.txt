I nearly died when I was nine years old, in the pond behind the big old manor house. That was the first time I saw her, scraps of flesh clinging to her skeletal face, wisps of hair drifting in the water. Had she drowned in that pond, too? Was her body somewhere in its depths, buried in silt, her violet dress turning green with algae? Or had she suffered some other fate? She floated in the water beside me, staring at me sadly from empty eye-sockets, as I gave up trying to free my foot from the sunken branch that had snagged it, and let the water pour into my lungs.

My cousin Trinity saved me, discovering me and pulling me from the water just in time. I was in the hospital for two days. The girl in the violet dress visited me there, too, but only when I was alone in the room. Somehow, I knew not to tell anyone else about her. The comings and goings of ghosts are meant to be kept secret.

The manor house had belonged to some elderly, now-deceased relative of mine. My mother and my Aunt Maggie, Trinity's mother, moved into it, with the idea of turning it into a bed-and-breakfast. Two single moms, struggling to make it in a world that was against them, for them the house was a golden opportunity. For Trinity and I, however, it was a maze of empty rooms and forgotten things, and the idea of exploring it both thrilled and terrified us.

I saw the girl in the violet dress from time to time, waiting for me on the stairs, or in an empty room, or watching me from the corner of my bedroom while I slept. Her name was Cindy. She wrote it in the dust on an old dresser in a third floor bedroom, one afternoon, when I found her in there, playing with costume jewelry that had been left behind in a drawer. I was never afraid of her, or of the others I saw from time to time in that old house. There was no menace in them. They were just souls that had gotten left behind somehow, sad, forgotten, lonely. Like clothes and toys abandoned in a closet in a room where no one goes anymore.

Cindy was with me the first time I played the piano in the room my mom called the parlor. I'd been taking lessons since I was five, and usually Mom had to force me to practice, making threats or offering sweets as bribes. But something about this piano called to me. It was a true antique, with its wood stained black, its yellowing keys, its curves imperfect because they had been carved by hand. Not like my music teacher's piano, newer than this one, but battered by children who couldn't be bothered to treat things gently. Not like my electric keyboard, with its synthetic, soulless tones.

I lifted the lid and pressed middle-C. A rich, velvety note rolled out to greet me. Cindy jerked her head toward me in surprise and interest. I sat down on the bench and began to play, just scales and arpeggios at first, then a few simple pieces that I'd been forced by my teacher to memorize. The old piano sang more and more sweetly as the dust that had built up on its strings was shaken away. I realized Cindy was standing very close to me. Despite the fact that her eyes were sunken pits and her lips were shriveled and stretched, I could clearly read delight on her face. She swayed to the music, enraptured in a way I had never seen her express before.

I began playing that old piano nearly every day. I brought the cardboard box of music workbooks and sheet music down from my bedroom and played through everything I had. Cindy always came to listen. One afternoon, she brought a friend. He was male, bent with age, and dressed in a rotting brown suit and tie. I had seen him occasionally in the garden. Now Cindy led him by the hand into the parlor, as if she couldn't bear to keep her newfound pleasure all to herself.

Others came to listen from time to time. A tall woman in a long apron that used to be white, whom I'd once seen scrubbing pots in the kitchen at midnight. A man in a faded black duster, who frequented the carriage house. A man with longer, thicker hair than the other ghosts, who sometimes perplexed Mom and Aunt Maggie by moving the furniture around. They came, curiosity in the tilt of their skeletal heads, and listened to me play.

It was Cindy who found the music book. I have no idea where she got it from. She simply brought it to me one day while I was playing, holding it out to me eagerly, longingly. Bound in faded and cracked red leather, its pages lined with the trails of silverfish, it looked ancient. Despite the damage to the binding and edges, the lines of music themselves showed very little damage. None of the songs were titled. I opened it up to the first page, propped it on the front of the piano, and played.

It began with a low chord, like a moan or a sigh, followed by a tinkling in the upper keys that put me in mind of rattling bones. Then it eased into a melody, slow and strange, in a minor key. It meandered through odd rhythms and asymmetrical measures, peppered with groans and whispers and rattles. For all its strangeness, the music was beautiful. It filled my imagination with moonlit gardens, candlelit halls, and dark stairways. It made me think of soft voices calling from far away, of memories and mostly forgotten dreams.

They came. One by one, they came. All the ghosts I'd ever seen in the old manor house or on the grounds, and some that I'd never seen before. They came in their tattered antique clothes, with their skin rotting off and their hair falling out and their eyes gone and their teeth looking huge beneath shrunken lips. They filed silently into the room, packing it with ghostly bodies, filling every corner. Cindy sat beside me on the bench. The woman in the apron put her hands on my shoulders. And they listened to me play music that seemed to be written just for them. For the dead, the lost, the forgotten, the left-behind. They listened, and they looked a little less lonely.

I played for them every day, and every day they came to listen.

“Why do you play that stuff?” Trinity asked me. “It's creepy. Why can't you play something fun, like songs from the radio? Make your mom buy you some new sheet music. Anything but this weird old garbage.”

I ignored her. She couldn't see them, after all, crowding the room, standing nearly on top of her, listening.

Filling up their empty, starving souls with music.
