*Alice Brenton, Feb 1, 1861 – April 29, 1869*
  
*Heaven has gained a daughter*
  

  
The headstone was small, sized to match the grave. Bunches of flowers lay on the freshly turned earth, and Rebecca Brenton sat among them.
  

  
Doctor Sam Carey stood a few paces back, feeling helpless beside the rawness of her grief. Scarlet fever had taken her child, despite his best efforts. Nothing he could do would ease that pain.
  

  
A pair of crows landed on the grave and deposited several small objects. Sam made to shoo them away, but Rebecca stopped him. Eyes wide, she lifted what the second crow had brought, a string of green glass beads.
  

  
“These are from Alice's favorite doll. She lost it a week before she got sick. I had to burn her other things, so the scarlet fever wouldn't spread. But that doll . . .”
  

  
The crows took flight. “Wait!” Rebecca cried, chasing after them. Sam followed. The birds descended into an arroyo outside of town. Rebecca and Sam climbed down the bank. Suddenly, their feet went out from under them, and they tumbled and slid along the riverbed. The sides of the gully curved around them like a dark tunnel.
  

  
Then Sam found himself on his back, looking up at the blue afternoon sky, where stars glittered brightly.
  

  
“What the – ”
  

  
The desert had turned to green fields, speckled with wildflowers. Mountains soared in the distance. With a flutter of wings, the two crows landed beside them. But they weren't crows anymore. They were children, a boy and a girl, with tan skin and black hair in long braids that seemed to shift and for a brief moment appear to be feathers.
  

  
“Where are we?” Sam whispered.
  

  
“The Otherlands,” said the boy. “We brought you here to tell you we're sad about Alice. She was our friend.”
  

  
Rebecca nodded in understanding. “You used to leave ribbons and stones on her windowsill. Did you bring her here, sometimes?”
  

  
“Yes,” said the girl. “She loved it here.”
  

  
A barking laugh sounded behind them. "What do we have here?” They turned to see a dark, handsome man with a toothy grin. “My serial offenders. I've told you two to stay out of the human world.”
  

  
“Coyote,” the crow-girl temporized. “You're looking, um, well-groomed today.”
  

  
The man sneered. “Flattery won't help you. I'm going to put you on a leash. And your human guests, too. Otherwise, everyone will think they can disobey me whenever they please.”
  

  
“Run!” the boy yelled. The two crows, for somehow they were crows again, flew at the man's face. Sam grabbed Rebecca's hand, and they fled into the hills. Rock formations twisted up around them. Howls echoed through the canyon.
  

  
A coyote leapt at them, slamming Sam to the ground. It grasped his ankle in its teeth and dragged him away at an impossible speed. Desperately, he hurled a rock at its head. It yelped and let go. Rolling to his feet, Sam ran.
  

  
“Rebecca!” he yelled, breath coming in exhausted gasps. There was no sign of her. The rocks ended abruptly, and he fell to his knees in a field of dandelions. White, dead puffs, gone to seed. Gone, like Alice. Like Rebecca now. Like so many others he'd been unable to save. It was as if all his failures were laid out before him in this field.
  

  
“You're wrong,” said a voice. Sam brushed tears from his eyes to see a doe with midnight blue fur. Incredibly, it was speaking. “They are not your past, but your future. Each seed is potential, a chance, a hope.”
  

  
“But I couldn't . . .”
  

  
“You see outcomes as success or failure, but in truth they're just seeds in the wind. The beginning is always today. Now. Make a wish.”
  

  
Sam blinked. Was it serious? “I wish Alice hadn't died.”
  

  
“You know you can't have that.”
  

  
“I wish I'd never lose another patient.”
  

  
“Again, no.”
  

  
“Then at least, let me rescue Rebecca.”
  

  
A sudden burst of wind tore the seeds from the dandelions, lifting them up in a cloud that stretched across the desert.
  

  
He followed the seeds. Each tiny line, carried by the breeze, added strength to his legs as he ran. They led him to a blind canyon, where the coyotes had Rebecca cornered.
  

  
The coyotes turned, and the wind drove the dandelion seeds into their eyes. Rebecca shot past them, and together they escaped among the towering rocks.
  

  
Crows cawed above them. Swooping over the canyon, the crows led them to a stream. It trickled from a tiny cave in a rock wall. Just inside it sat Alice's doll.
  

  
Rebecca picked it up and hugged it tightly. “Thank you,” she told the crow-children. “For being her friend.”
  

  
They smiled. “We wouldn't have had it otherwise.”
