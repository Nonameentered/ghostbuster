I'm totally a pantser. I'm a very impulsive writer, and I tend to put down ideas as they come, and let the characters tell me what they want to do in their own time. I make bullet lists and outlines of all the ideas that I have, mostly so that I don't forget them before I write them down, and to organize my thoughts a little so that I have a rough idea of what I'm doing. But if a story decides to jump into my head, I don't let not knowing where it's going to go stop me from writing it down. LOL, I'm currently writing for Serial Sunday on r/shortstories. My serial has a murder mystery as a central part of the plotline, and I was on, like, Chapter 5 before I figured out who dun it . . . 

I'm not sure if this makes me a good writer or a bad one, but it's the only way I know how to be. I've written one full novel, and I was constantly going back and changing things to keep up continuity with later ideas, or because I thought of something better that what I'd written before. I'm an edit-as-I-go writer, which from what I've seen doesn't seem to be typical. But I can't stand to wait until I had written the whole first draft to fix and change things.

I come from a table-top roleplaying game background (think Dungeons and Dragons), and I find my style of writing is very much like being a game master. I'm playing all the characters myself, but I still don't know what they're going to do half the time until it comes out. But my time gamemastering (and the two full-length campaigns I've run) have made me pretty good at rolling with unexpected twists and characters who just won't stick to the script.

I want to plan. I really do. But the characters living in my head are too impatient to allow it!
