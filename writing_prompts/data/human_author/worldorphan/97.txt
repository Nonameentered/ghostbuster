**Reflections**

  
The antique mirror on the bedroom closet door held our reflections framed in the doorway to the hall. Except that at that angle, it shouldn't show the doorway. The hall beyond the door was wrong, too, the floor bare instead of carpet, the walls gray instead of peach. Trembling, I grasped my husband's hand. "Ready?"
  

  
We'd moved into the house a month ago, relocating for Jason's job. He would be working better hours, and I'd be working from home. With more time to devote to each other and our girls, we'd hoped to fix our family. We'd had so much passion, once. But Jason and I had grown distant, our daughters willful and moody. Sometimes I wondered if we even loved each other any more.
  

  
The house was a roomy, turn-of-the-century Tudor. At first we'd been charmed by the large antique mirrors scattered around. The first time I saw an unnatural shadow reflected in one of them, I convinced myself I was just over-tired. And Jason and I wouldn't tolerate any haunted-house talk from our daughters. It was normal to feel uneasy in a new place, we told them. We'd get used to the house in time.
  

  
Then, one morning, I lost my favorite necklace. I set it down on the bathroom counter, and it was just gone. With confusion bordering on horror, I realized I could still see it reflected in the mirror. More things started vanishing from around the house. Towels, books, toys, coffee mugs. Missing, but still visible in a mirror.
  

  
Finally, tonight, I'd come upstairs to check on the girls, and found them gone. “Emmy? Hailey?” No answer. “Oh, there you are,” I'd said with relief as I saw them through the bathroom doorway. But something was wrong. Their faces were masks of terror. I came into the room; they weren't there. I was seeing their reflections in the mirror. They were trapped inside it.
  

  
I'd screamed. Jason came running. We'd pounded on the glass, tried to pry the mirror from the wall. Jason wanted to smash it, but I wouldn't let him. That was when the creature appeared. Tall, lanky, swathed in shadows, it made a 'come hither' gesture, then slunk away. We followed it from one mirror to the next, ending at the mirror on our bedroom closet door. It regarded us from the hallway that was not ours, then vanished. 
  

  
We stood before the mirror. Jason didn't question me, or play the chauvinist and insist I stay behind. We stepped through. The hallway beyond was identical to our home, but completely bare and deserted. Distantly, we heard the girls screaming. Working together as we hadn't done in years, we searched room after room, all familiar, but connected in impossible ways. Twisting, labyrinthine, fractal. I had never felt like this before, terrified, but moving with crystal clear purpose.
  

  
We burst into a room like nothing in our real house. It had nine sides. Each side was a floor-to-ceiling mirror, and each reflected the creature. And our daughters.
  

  
“Mommy! Daddy!” Hailey and Emmy hammered the glass with their fists. Jason reached for them. His hand went right through, but he drew it back with a gasp of pain.
  

  
The creature laughed, its voice like a nail shearing glass. “That's your warning. Guess wrong again, you die.”
  

  
I looked from one identical reflection to another, trying to spot a clue. Tears threatened as I imagined the heartache of losing our girls. Jason put an arm around me. How had I forgotten how much I loved him? The amorous feelings we'd shared when we'd first met hadn't dwindled; they'd deepened. I would do anything for him, and he for me. And our girls . . .
  

  
That's when I saw it. My daughters were very close, always hugging, holding hands. But the none of the girls in the mirrors were touching. On impulse, I looked up. The ceiling was also a mirror, and in it Hailey and Emmy sat with their arms around each other, sobbing. 
  

  
Jason stretched his six-foot frame until his hands reached the low ceiling. It dissolved at his touch, the girls tumbling into our arms.
  

  
The four of us bolted through the maze of rooms and hallway, the creature right behind us. Finally we saw a reflection of color, the blue quilt on the bed in our true house. We emerged through the mirror on the closet door. Jason hefted a chair and smashed it. The creature's screams echoed. We shattered every mirror in the house. Then we fled to a hotel.
  

  
I worried we'd have to raze the house to the ground. But when we dared to return two days later, everything seemed normal. We replaced the mirrors, and waited. Nothing happened. Whatever was haunting our house, we'd beaten it. Together.
