**Stay With Me**  (set in the EU of the Dragonriders of Pern series by Anne McCaffery)
  

  
“They're coming!” Thilla hissed excitedly.
  

  
Bresee bent over her sewing. It wouldn't do to be caught staring.
  

  
The dragonriders strode into the cavern, deep in conversation.
  

  
“R'mart's letter confirms everything we said,” Weyrleader J'frey told his wing-second, F'cant, waving a handful of pages. “The Oldtimers at Southern only fly against Thread when they feel like it.”
  

  
“It's proof of their shame,” F'cant agreed. “Exiling them was the right decision.”
  

  
“Is my jacket ready?” J'frey asked.
  

  
Bresee had just finished repairing the holes the Thread had burned in the garment. Thilla snatched it and handed to the Weyrleader, blushing and giggling.
  

  
Bresee rolled her eyes. Granted, the dragonriders were young and handsome. And you had to be a bit of a liar to live and work alongside men who risked their lives to protect all of Pern, and pretend you weren't awestruck in their presence.
  

  
N'soll slouched into the cavern, and now Bresee's heart fluttered. Not because she was smitten with the blue rider, but because he had once allowed her to touch his dragon, Kirith. She still remembered the soft feel and spicy scent of his hide. As a girl, Bresee had never had the chance to Impress a dragon. She would give anything to soar on the back of a dragon, and to know the mystery of being bonded mind and soul with one of those magnificent creatures.

Thread fell like silvery rain, deceptively beautiful, infinitely deadly. Whenever Pern's neighboring planet, the Red Star, passed close in its orbit, these voracious spores crossed the void of space to fall on their world, consuming everything they touched.
  

  
F'cant signaled his wing forward. The riders fanned out, chasing clumps of Thread. Their dragons belched flames, incinerating the deadly menace before it could reach the ground. Kirith and N'soll shot upward, burning a cloud of it to ash, then disappeared Between, taking cover in that cold, black space between spaces. They reappeared above the collection of Thread they had dodged, darted down, and destroyed that too.
  

  
The wind shifted suddenly, blowing a dense mass of thread directly at them. It struck N'soll in the face and chest. White-hot pain assaulted his senses. Kirith went Between again, where the Thread froze and turned to black dust. But it was too late.
  

  
\----------
  
Bresee assisted the healers in the bowl of the Weyr, ready with numbweed, hot water, clean cloths, and bandages, to care for the injured riders and dragons. 
  

  
A tortured bellow shook the air as a blue dragon blinked in from Between, nearly crashing in his haste to land. Bresee identified Kirith, but the rider who toppled from his back was so horrifically scored he was barely recognizable. A gaping red line transected his throat. Horrible wet sound issued from him as he struggled and failed to breathe.
  

  
A dozen healers and helpers descended on N'soll, trying vainly to save him.
  

  
She felt a pressure in her mind and turned, meeting the faceted eyes of the blue dragon. The pressure became a wordless anguish at the inevitability of loss.
  

  
“Oh, Kirith. I'm so sorry.”
  

  
His eyes darkened. With a jolt of horror, Bresee understood. The bond between dragon and rider was so strong that for one to live without the other was unendurable. If a rider lost his dragon, he was left crippled by depression and trauma. If a dragon lost his rider, he simply went Between and didn't return.
  

  
“Wait!” Bresee cried. “Don't go!”
  

  
*I can't be without him!* Kirith wailed in her mind. *I can't be alone!*
  

  
As if predicated by that thought, Masterhealer Oben suddenly sobbed.
  

  
Kirith howled.
  

  
“No!” Bresee cried. She grabbed his enormous head and locked eyes with him. “Don't go!”
  

  
*There is a hole in my heart, as empty and endless as Between. It hurts. Death would be better. Better than being alone.*
  

  
He flexed his wings. If he took flight, he would fly Between and be lost forever.
  

  
“You're not alone. You have me. I know you loved N'soll, and he loved you. Nothing can replace that love. But stay with me, and I promise *I* will love you. I can't fill the hole he left inside you, but I can make it easier to bear.”
  

  
*You cannot,* he said, but as if he were daring her to prove him wrong.
  

  
“Stay with me. We'll avenge N'soll by fighting Thread. If we save even one person from suffering loss, then we've made a difference. N'soll would want us to keep fighting.”
  

  
*Us.*
  

  
With that word, Bresee seemed to fall into those huge jeweled eyes. She felt Kirith's pain, and she bore it. She shared it. And together, that pain was bearable. It bound them together, the bond of dragon and rider.
  

  
*Bresee. My own, my love. For you I will stay.*
