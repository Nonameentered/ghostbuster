The Memory Birds

Damien awoke to the aroma of sizzling bacon. The minstrel hadn't liked the idea of sleeping in a witch's cottage, but last night's storm hadn't left him much choice. Cautiously, he ventured downstairs. The table was spread with eggs, bacon, fruit, bread, butter, and jam. Not a bat wing or newt eye in sight. Gretchen, the witch, passed him a plate.


A young man clumped in.


“Jack!” Gretchen scolded. “How will I clean all this up? Why are you so muddy?”


“You said to water the pigs. They wouldn't stand still while I poured it on them, so I had to chase them around the pen.”


Gretchen sighed. “Please excuse him. I found him wandering in the woods with amnesia. I'm not sure if he was this simple before losing his memories or not.”


“That's curious,” Damien noted. “I just came from the palace, and Princess Charlotte has amnesia as well.”


“Oh, really?” Gretchen raised a warty eyebrow.


“Rhineholdt, the royal wizard, found her unconscious in the garden, poisoned by something. He saved her life, but not her memory. She and Rhineholdt are getting married, by the way.”


“Did she, now? Hmm. I think I'll pay a visit to the palace. And I'd appreciate your help, Master Damien.”

Posing as a root doctor, Gretchen was granted a royal audience. Jack waited outside.


“Your Majesty, I don't see why we must humor this old woman,” Rhineholdt sneered. He was much too old to be marrying the beautiful young princess, and he had a pallid, seedy look about him.


“Now, now,” said the King, “We must explore every option to cure the Princess.”


“Where is Charlotte?” Gretchen asked.


“Confined to her rooms.” Rhineholdt retorted. “Her constitution is quite fragile just now.”


“I may have something for that. Jack, bring my bags, please.”


Gretchen had timed Jack's entrance for a moment when the wizard was taking a sip of wine. His choking and spluttering upon seeing the young man told her all she needed to know.

Meanwhile, Damien snuck into the royal garden and scaled the wall to the Princess's window.


She crossed the room when she heard him knocking, but her voice was muffled by the glass.


“What?”


She unlatched the window and swung it open. “I said, I can't let you in. Rhineholdt says I mustn't open the window.”


Damien climbed past her and into the room. “You have a lovely view,” he remarked, looking out into the garden. “Although you are even more lovely.”


She smiled. “I do enjoy looking upon my garden. I wish I could go into it, but Rhineholdt fears I will be re-exposed to whatever made me ill before.”


A pair of doves fluttered onto a branch. Charlotte beamed. “They visit me every day. I think Rhineholdt was trying to catch them for me. He chased them around the garden with his magic staff. He cares for me very much, you know.”


–


Damien climbed back down from Charlotte's window and met Gretchen at the palace gates.


“Rhineholdt is responsible for Jack's affliction as well as Charlotte's.”


“And something is up with the doves in the garden.”


Gretchen shook her head. “What an embrangled mess. I wonder what we'll find when we untangle it.”


–


Damien led Charlotte blindfolded through the palace. The guards recognized him from his previous visit, and he moved with such confidence that they didn't question his actions. 


“We're not going outside, are we? Rhineholdt says I mustn't -”


“Don't worry, Milady. You'll like this surprise.”


They emerged into the garden, and Damien pulled off the blindfold. Jack was standing right in front of her. Tentatively, he reached out and took her hands.


The doves alighted on Jack and Charlotte's shoulders. There was a sound like chiming bells, and the birds vanished in a flash of light.


“I remember!” Jack gasped.


“Oliver? Is it really you?” Charlotte whispered.


“I have never been such a real person as I am today.”


“I love you so much. I can't believe I forgot.” Their heads tilted toward each other, their lips almost touching.


“No!”


Rhineholdt burst into the garden, shooting fire from his staff. Gretchen gestured, and the flames became a shower of leaves.


“Charlotte! My darling, listen!”


She shook her head. “I can't believe what you say, because I see what you do.”


“But I love you!”


“You never loved me. Lust maybe. A desire to possess me. But never love. I refused your proposal, and when you saw me with Oliver, you turned our memories into birds.”


“Why birds?” Gretchen wondered.


“I - I like birds,” the wizard floundered. “Anyway, you can't marry him. He's a commoner.”


“I can do anything I want. I'm a princess. I'll see you rotting in the dungeon for this! But first -” She pulled Jack – Oliver – into a passionate kiss.
