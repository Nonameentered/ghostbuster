**The Sky Sages**

Once upon a time, there was a Princess whose christening was attended by a Faerie. She gave her the power to control the weather with her emotions. When she was happy, it was sunny and mild. When she cried, it rained, and when she was angry or frightened, there were storms or snows.
  

  
The Queen taught the little Princess to control her feelings. She learned to stay calm and never lose her temper. She allowed herself to be sad only when the crops needed rain. The child grew, and the kingdom prospered.
  

  
Then one day the Princess fell gravely ill. Her fever dreams brought terrible storms that ravaged the lands. The Queen summoned the wisest healers and physicians, but none could cure the child, nor calm the brutal storms.
  

  
The Queen begged the Faerie for help. "My gift is part of her now," she told the Queen. "I could no more remove it than I could cause the sea to dry up."
  

  
The Queen then vowed to seek out the Sages. The first Sage lived atop a mountain so high that its spire was veiled by clouds. She climbed for three days, until her limbs trembled from exhaustion. At the top she found a glade bathed in warm sunshine. It was inviting after her arduous climb.
  

  
“You've come a long way,” said the Sage. “I will gladly answer any questions. But first, please bring me a honeycomb from my hive. Take care to keep your feelings in check. The bees will sting you if they sense fear.”
  

  
Though brave, the Queen was badly stung by the time she returned to the Sage. He drizzled the honey into his tea, drank it, and spread the leaves upon the table before him.
  

  
He shook his head. “I cannot see a cure for the Princess. Perhaps the Sage of the Sky Islands will know.”
  

  
He brought out a small boat so light it could float among the clouds. Then he lashed his three cleverest ravens to it. The Queen climbed in, and the ravens pulled the boat like horses pulling a chariot.
  

  
They sailed for a day and a night. When the moon came out, an ethereal light revealed a floating island. A stern man beckoned to the Queen from the a grand house with silvery marble columns.
  

  
"I assume you have come with a question for me." He handed her an iron pitcher. "Fill this."
  

  
"From what?" The Queen saw neither a well nor a spring.
  

  
“From the clouds, of course."
  
The Queen dipped the pitcher into a cloud, and water seeped into it as slowly as dew forming. It seemed to take forever. At last it was full. The Sky Island Sage poured the water into a scrying basin and peered into it.
  

  
“I cannot see a cure for the Princess,” he said. “Seek out the Sage of the Clouds. If anyone knows, he will.”
  

  
The Queen returned to her boat and sailed onward. The clouds darkened, and rain fell. The wind became a howling gale so strong the ravens could not fly against it. The Queen pulled them into the boat and covered them with her cloak, where they shivered miserably.
  

  
When the storm ended, the Queen's boat had washed up on a bank of clouds. An old man lay sleeping nearby, looking as battered and weary as she felt. She woke him gently, and offered him an apple, the last of the food the Mountain Sage had given her.
  

  
He smiled at her. “I am the Sage of the Clouds. In my dreams I have seen what troubles you.” He gave her a silver pendant shaped like a teardrop. “When the Princess wears this over her heart, she will be well again.” 
  

  
The cloud the Queen stood upon began to sink, until she found herself back in the courtyard of her own castle. She rushed to her daughter's bedside and clasped the pendant around her neck. The girl opened her eyes, sat up in bed, and threw her arms around her mother. Then she began to cry. 
  

  
She cried all the tears that she had kept inside all the years of her life. She howled with rage and frustration and hurt. Her mother did not stop her. She simply held her until every tear had been shed. Outside, the storm finally ceased. A breathtaking rainbow spread over the land. 
  

  
The Queen took the pendant, which was now also colored like a rainbow, and placed it around her own neck. She wore it as a contract, as a promise, never to force her child to deny her feelings again. Because fear can be overcome, pain can be borne, frustration can be tempered with patience. Storms will come, but they will also pass. And when they do, love will remain, waiting, as always.
