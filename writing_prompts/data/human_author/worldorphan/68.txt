“Come over here, Bixx!” I called. The little homunculus dropped the jar of frog spawn he had been carrying. I was always careful not to allow him to handle anything volatile and hard to replace. He wasn't much to look at. Being my first creation, he was significantly flawed. Standing only two feet tall, his arms and legs were lumpy and malformed, though still mostly functional, and his head resembled a potato with round eyes and a wide, gap-toothed mouth.
  

  
Seeing the Fairy noble, he straightened his clothes self-consciously. Several dead roaches fell out.
  

  
“Bixx,” I said, “Let me introduce Her Grace Sericea, Duchess of Bloodied Thorns. She is a noble in the court of Queen Mab herself."
  

  
“Queen?” the homunculus asked, looking quizzically at the Fairy.
  

  
“No, no. She serves the Queen. She is a Duchess. You address her as Your Grace.”
  

  
“Grace,” he said, giving a clumsy bow. “Bixx at your service.”
  

  
“I fear there has been a misunderstanding,” Duchess Sericea said. “Our deal was for your first-born. Born. Not . . . whatever you did to create this . . . thing.”
  

  
“But Your Grace, he *was* born,” I explained patiently. “I created him in miniature using parts from various small animals, soaked him in a bath of growth hormones, and then implanted him into the womb of a goat to finish his last two months of gestation in a more natural environment. The goat gave birth to him.”
  

  
“That's . . . disgusting.” With some effort, the Duchess schooled her revolted expression into something more composed. “Still, our deal was for *your* first-born. Born to *you*.”
  

  
“My lady, being of the male variety, I hardly have the anatomy to give birth to anything.”
  

  
“No, I mean born from your seed. Your . . . genetic material.”
  

  
“Bixx contains plenty of my genetic material. I used tissue grown in-vitro from my own cheek cells to form his connective membranes and most of his skin.”
  

  
The Duchess looked queasy again. Some people just cannot appreciate the variant medical sciences. 
  

  
“Bixx,” I said in a gentle but authoritarian tone, “you are going to go with the Duchess now. You will live with her, obey her commands, and serve her to the best of your ability. Remember, your actions reflect upon me, so make me proud.”
  

  
The little homunculus nodded slowly. I hoped he understood. He wasn't the sharpest scalpel on the slab.
  

  
“When I come home again, Papa?” he asked me.
  

  
I turned to the Duchess. “I *have* grown fond of the little abomination,” I said. “How do feel about holiday visitation rights?”
