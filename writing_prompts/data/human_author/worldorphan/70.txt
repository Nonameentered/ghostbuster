Hi!  I enjoy writing constraints. I've been contributing to SEUS since I discovered it, and it's a blast to try to make everything fit.

Except word limits. I hate word limits. It does help me to write succinctly, but this sub never gives us enough words. I end up writing a great story, then butchering it to make it fit the word count. Can we have constrained writing with 1000 word limits? That's about my speed!
