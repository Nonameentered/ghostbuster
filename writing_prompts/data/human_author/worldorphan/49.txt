I joined this subreddit in February, so I didn't post any resolutions. But one of my goals was to become  active in the writing community. I've made some good friends here, so I think I did well towards that goal. Y'all are all awesome, and it's been great writing with you all this year!

I want to keep being active in writing prompts. My resolution is to write at least one story a week.

My other resolution for this year is to edit my novel. I finished it in November of last year, and I've taken almost a whole year as a break from it, practicing my writing, and learning about the craft. This year I'm going to do some serious editing and hopefully get my book ready to submit queries by the end of the year. 

If anyone knows some good resources on editing books, I'd love some suggestions. Not for grammar and word choice. I'm good on that. But for stuff like pacing and character arcs and story layout. I want to make my book the best it can be.
