May I Come Ashore?


I hear the pu blowing every afternoon, right until sunset. The call of the conch shell trumpet comes in from over the water, clear and resonant.

The Hawaiian people have sounded the pu since ancient times. It's a greeting, a welcome. It's blown at the beginning of ceremonies and celebrations. Sailors used it as well. The sound carries for miles, so when a ship came near, they would blow the pu to ask permission to come into the harbor, and the people on the shore would return the call.

This sound, though, no one else hears it but me. I don't know what that means, but I know I'm supposed to answer the call. What will I be giving permission to come ashore? I don't know. But it's something I have to do.

I can play the pu, but I don't own one. I could borrow one from someone, I guess, but then I would have to tell them why. "Alamea, you're seventeen. That's too old for make-believe," they'll say. I'll just have to get a pu the hard way.

I spend several hours combing the beach for conch shells, but no luck. So I get the family boat and my snorkeling gear, and go out into the bay. I have to be careful; these waters can get dangerous. Strong currents, hidden reefs and rocks. Drownings and boating accidents happen in the seas near our small town every year. About ten years ago, the mayor's son was killed when his boat struck a reef. Kahale Kimo. There's a memorial plaque for him in my school. The local government started a campaign for boater safety, so it's better than it used to be. Anyway I'm staying close to the shore.

Face down in my snorkel mask, I search. Detritus litters the sea floor; all the shells I see are broken. I'm surrounded by a rainbow of darting fish. A reef triggerfish, what we call humuhumunukunukuapua'a, drifts along the bottom, blowing jets of water and sand from its mouth. It sees me and dives into a crevice in the rock, using its spines to wedge itself in place. I couldn't get it out of there if I wanted to.

At last I see the treasure I'm looking for. A beautiful intact, but empty, helmet shell rests in the white sand beneath a cluster of large rocks. It's deep, though. I get big gulp of air, and dive for it. The rocks are volcanic, porous and rough. They'll scrape the skin right off you. The crevice is narrow, and I have to twist and squeeze to fit myself far enough inside to reach my prize. I grasp it and try to pull myself back out. To my horror, I realize I'm stuck.

I'm upside-down, wedged between the rocks. I can't get the right leverage to extract myself. I'm like the triggerfish, except that instead of spines, it's gravity and my own clumsy body holding me in place. I'm getting short on breath, but I'm too pugnacious to panic, not yet. I wriggle and twist. The rocks tear my wet-suit. But there is no getting out. My lungs burn, and I have to fight hard against the urge to inhale. My awareness starts to fuzz around the edges.

All at once, a strong current catches my flippers, tugging me backward. My hips shift, scraping painfully against the rocks, but then I'm free. I push backward and slide out of the crevice. I surface, gasping, the conch clutched tightly in my hand.

The sun has almost set by the time I return to shore. I can still hear the distant pu sounding over the waves. I make a hole in my own conch; then I put it to my lips and blow. It resonates loud and clear through the night air. A small boat appears, just beyond the rocks, someone standing at the prow. He and the boat are both transparent. Before I can be too shocked by that, I recognize him. It's Kahale Kimo. He looks just like his picture on his memorial plaque. He smiles at me, and hops off his boat. As his feet touch the sand, he and the boat disappear, vanishing along with the sun at the edge of the horizon.

I've been thinking about the decrease in boating accidents in the bay since Kahale's death. Was it really the new safety ordinances, or was it Kahale pushing boats away from reefs, pulling swimmers out of the currents? Was it the current that pulled me out from between the rocks, or was it Kahale?

Now that I've put his ghost to rest, will there be more accidents again? I don't know. But I think, after ten years of saving people from the ocean, Kahale deserves to come home.
