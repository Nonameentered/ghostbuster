*This play immediately follows the events of William Shakespeare's* A Midsummer Night's Dream*. I've written it in plain English for the sake of expediency and my sanity.*
  

  

  
SCENE I. Athens. An Apartment in the Palace of THESEUS.
  

  
*(Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, Lords, and Attendants)*
  

  
THESEUS: Well, fair Hippolyta, our day of nuptials draws to a close.
  

  
HIPPOLYTA: Indeed. It has been a splendid wedding, full of merriment. Even that dreadful play could not spoil my feelings of joy. You agree that the play was terrible, do you not?
  

  
THESEUS: Oh, yes. I don't know what was worse, the acting, the script, or the body-odor of the cast.  Oh, but look! Here come the actors. What should we say to them?
  

  
HIPPOLYTA: Let us not say anything unkind. I would hate to taint this joyous day with anyone's unhappiness.
  

  
*(Enter QUINCE, followed by BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNUG, and STARVELING. QUINCE approaches THESUES and HIPPOLYTA, while the others hang back.)*
  

  
QUINCE: Noble Lord and Lady, pray, tell us what you thought of our performance.
  

  
THESUES: A most unique adaptation of the tale. I've never seen it's like.
  

  
*(HIPPOLYTA signifies agreement.)*
  

  
*(Lights dim on THESEUS and HIPPOLYTA, and the spotlight follows QUINCE as he rejoins the other Actors.)*
  

  
QUINCE: Good news! They loved our performance! I shall go hence and find us another engagement.
  

  
*(Enter PUCK, unseen by the Actors.)*
  

  
PUCK: These actors are quite pitiful. I shall follow them, and surely an opportunity for more sport shall arise. Perhaps I'll make some improvements to their performance. I certainly can't make it any worse.
  

  
*(Actors exit. PUCK exits after them.)*
  

  

  
SCENE II. A Room in a Cottage.
  

  
*(Enter QUINCE, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNUG, and STARVELING.)*
  

  
QUINCE: My good fellows, I have arranged for an encore performance of Pyramus and Thisbe. We shall play at the home of Lord Cleathes and Lady Nephele, at their daughter's birthday celebration.
  

  
BOTTOM: We shall embellish our roles even further. The hearts of the audience shall swing from sorrow to delight and back again!
  

  
FLUTE: Perhaps we can have new costumes? Thisbe's wig is full of lice.
  

  
SNUG: I must practice my roaring. I fear the Lion wasn't fierce enough.
  

  
QUINCE: See to everything yourselves. We shall rehearse now, and in three days, the show shall go on.
  

  
*(PUCK enters on the far side of the stage, giggles, and exits again.)*
  

  

  
ACT III. A Room in the Home of CLEATHES. 
  

  
*(Enter CLEATHES, NEPHELE, their daughter PHILINNA, young son PELAGON, and Party Guests, Stage Right.  Enter  BOTTOM as PYRAMUS, FLUTE as THISBE, and QUINCE as WALL, Stage Left.)*
  

  
*(The Actors begin their play, but in pantomime, their lines inaudible. The spotlight is on CLEATHES, NEPHELE, PHILINNA, AND PELAGON as they observe the play.)*
  

  
PELAGON: Mother, why is that man wearing a bedsheet, and why is his face painted with lime? And what's he doing with his fingers?
  

  
NEPHELE: That man represents the wall that both separates and joins Thisbe and Pyramus, whose parents forbid their love. The space between his fingers represents a crack in the wall, through which the lovers may speak. 
  

  
PHILINNA: But why do they not use a curtain as the wall?
  

  
*(PYRAMUS and THISBE kiss through WALL's fingers. PELAGON points and laughs.)*
  

  
PYRAMUS *(aloud)*: Meet me at Ninny's tomb by moonlight, my love.
  

  
PHILINNA: I know this story. It is called Ninus's tomb, is it not?
  

  
CLEATHES: It is indeed.
  

  
*(Exit PYRAMUS and WALL.)*
  

  
*(Enter PUCK, far Stage Left)*
  

  
PUCK: Time to liven things up!
  

  
*(Enter SNUG as LION, far Stage Left, as if waiting for his cue. He does not see PUCK. PUCK taps him on the shoulder, then exits far Stage Left, and SNUG follows.)*
  

  
*(Enter STARVELING as MOONSHINE, carrying a lantern.)*
  

  
MOONSHINE: I present myself as the moon, that bright globe that doth shine upon these two lovers who meet to woo.
  

  
*(PELAGON laughs again.)*
  

  
NEPHELE: Ah, but that I had the easy mirth of youth, that I could find merriment in this vile show.
  

  
CLEATHES: Aging is not lost youth; it is gained wisdom. You and I have the wisdom to comprehend the wretchedness of what lies before us.
  

  
PHILINNA: Truly, this is the stupidest thing I've ever seen.
  

  
*(Enter LION, unseen by THISBE. Instead of a mask, his head has been transformed into the head of a real lion.)*
  

  
THISBE: This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is â€“ 
  

  
*(The LION roars. THISBE turns and sees it, screams, and comically runs around the stage in terror. The LION chases her. THISBE's wig falls off. Eventually THISBE exits Stage Left.)*
  

  
*(While the LION is chasing THISBE, PELAGON and PHILINNA laugh, and CLEATHES and NEPHELE gape. After THISBE exits, the LION runs in their direction. They all scream and exit Stage Right, chased by the LION.)*
  

  
*(Enter PUCK)*
  

  
PUCK: As I am an honest Puck, I'm not sure how I am going to make amends for this one. Do you think I can convince them that this was all a dream, too?
