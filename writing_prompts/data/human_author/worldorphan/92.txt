**Beyond the Tunnel**

“We can't go in there,” Kayla quailed. “We have no idea what's in it, or where it goes!” The rough stone tunnel vanished into the hillside. Barking echoed out of it.
  

  
I'd been biking home from my piano lesson at Mr. Barlow's house when I'd seen Kayla and Sophia going into the woods, calling for Sophia's dog, Mickey. He was a border collie with big black ears like his namesake. He was also an expert at slipping his leash.
  

  
“He can't be that far in,” I said. “The tunnel can't be that long. If you go around this hill, you end up at the back of the country club, and that's only a quarter-mile away.”
  

  
“Rin doesn't know what she's talking about,” Kayla snapped. “She doesn't even know if she wants to be a boy or a girl!”
  

  
“They,” I corrected her with a glare, “bike around this subdivision every day.” Kayla and Sophia were my neighbors, not my friends. They were middle-schoolers, two years younger than me. Prissy, bratty, gossipy girls. But I liked Sophia's dog.
  

  
I led us into the tunnel; I had to crouch. It was dark. Kayla turned on the flashlight app on her phone, but it didn't help much. Something skittered under our feet, and the girls squealed. I hoped it was just a rat.
  

  
Suddenly, something didn't feel right. The timbre of Mickey's bark changed, like he was outside. We emerged a few minutes later. Wan moonlight shone on jumbled piles of stones. Dry grass crunched under our feet. Red stars glittered overhead.
  

  
Where the hell were we, and how was it night?
  

  
“No, no, no!” Kayla was freaking out. I didn't share her complete agnostophobia, but this was definitely not what I'd signed up for. I tried to hide my unease.
  

  
“Mickey?” Sophia called. We could still hear him, somewhere distant. We headed toward the sound.
  

  
Something caught my ankle, and my feet went out from under me. Something wrapped around my leg. Fingers? Tentacles? I couldn't turn myself the right way to see it. Kayla and Sophia cringed uselessly. I kicked hard with my free leg, and the thing released me. 
  

  
I scrambled to my feet. “Did you see what it was?” They shook their heads, too freaked talk.
  

  
The mounds of rocks became the ruins of stone houses, some intact, some collapsed. There was no sign of habitation. As we passed near a doorway, Kayla turned to say something, and then she was flying backward, disappearing into the blackness inside, snatched by something unseen.
  

  
If I'd stopped to think, I might've just let the monsters have her. She always treated me like a freak. Fortunately for her, my lizard brain chose fight instead of flight, and I plunged in after her.
  

  
The darkness inside the hut was absolute. I heard muffled cries and scuffling, and groped towards them. My fingers touched something that simultaneously burned and froze, like dry ice. I drew back in pain, then punched the thing with as much strength as I could muster. I connected with something solid and heard a crack.
  

  
I kicked and flailed at the enigmatic attacker. Kayla yelped as I hit her by accident. Oops. Sorry, not sorry. I heard running footsteps; Kayla was free. She burst through the gray outline of the doorway, and I followed. I grabbed a sobbing Sophia and hauled her along as we fled. Was it chasing us? I didn't look to find out.
  

  
We stumbled to a halt, catching our breath. I examined my hands. There were no wounds, but an unseen pain permeated. I looked up. Mickey's barks were much louder. Suddenly, a blur of black and white fur knocked Sophia over. 
  

  
Sophia laughed in relief, wiping dog slobber off her face. “Let's get out of here.”
  

  
I could feel hidden eyes watching as we scampered for the tunnel. It seemed narrower than before. The walls were ice cold, and felt somehow ethereal, as if my hands would pass right through them. As if something could reach through them and grab me. 
  

  
Kayla and Sophia faltered, afraid to go forward, afraid to go back. But I pressed on. I didn't know what was going to happen, but that pretty much summed up my life. I had so many things I hadn't figured out yet. It was terrifying. But it was a familiar fear, and I could get through it. I grabbed their hands, kept going, and abruptly we were all blinking in the afternoon sunlight in the woods at the edge of the subdivision. 
  

  
We never spoke of that place again. People, especially adults, don't like to hear about things they don't understand. Kayla's nicer to me these days, though. I guess we understand each other better now.
