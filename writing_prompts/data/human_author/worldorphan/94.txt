The clouds twisted and stretched into a long, serpentine form, which undulated through the sky toward them at a rapid pace. Flaring out its brilliant azure wings to slow itself, the dragon glided into a landing on the grass in front of them.
  

  
Amelia tried to speak, but nothing came out.
  

  
“At last, I have found you!” The dragon's voice was a deep, sonorous rumble. It lowered its massive head in what could only be a bow. “Chosen one, I have searched seven worlds, and time is growing short.” 
  

  
“Are – are you talking to us?” Trevor stammered.
  

  
“I am speaking to you, my lady,” it said, its gaze resting expectantly upon Amelia. “You bear the Amulet of Imizael.”
  

  
“What, this?” She grasped the pendent she wore, an intricate silver medallion with a large white stone in the center. “Trevor bought this for me at an antique store last week.” 
  

  
“The Amulet came to you, because it was meant to. Only you can unlock it's power and use it to lift the curse on the kingdom of Cimmouria and save their world.” The dragon shook its wings in what might have been impatience. “I am Feiruyth. I have been sent to bring you to Cimmouria and guide you to the Tower of Promise, which has fallen to the curse, and where you must use the power of the Amulet.” 
  

  
The dragon bent its sinuous back close to the ground. Amelia and Trevor looked at one another.
  

  
“Well, Ames, you always said you wanted more adventure in your life.” He climbed onto the dragon's back and reached out his hand to her. She took it, and away they flew. The clouds swirled again, opening up into a great round portal, a gate to another world.
