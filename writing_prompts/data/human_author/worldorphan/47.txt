I held the glass ball in my hand, let it roll from my palm to my fingers. I twisted my wrist and in a fluid motion rolled it over my fingertips onto the back of my hand, then back to my palm again. The family of four who had stopped to watch my act clapped enthusiastically. Beside me, Tasha played a jaunty flourish on her violin. The children grinned. I rolled the ball around my hand again, and it changed color from clear to a transparent red. I was met with a chorus of oohs and ahhs. In time to Tasha's music, I made another pass, and the ball turned from red to blue. The family was delighted. Tasha ended her tune, and we both took a bow. They tossed some bills into my cap and Tasha's violin case, and went on their way.
  

  
Tasha and I had been working together for almost six months. We'd met by accident. She was a music major at the university. She had just obtained her busking license, and wasn't sure how to get started. I offered to let her share my corner, to show her the ropes. We made a good pair, and decided to work together on a regular basis. I liked Tasha. She was fun to talk to, and had lots of stories about the small town where she grew up. And she was  attractive, a curvy girl with bright eyes and a mess of brown curls. She had a boyfriend, but he was a creep. Eventually, I knew, she would dump him, and then I'd have a chance.
  

  
“That was a good one, Jiro,” Tasha said with a radiant grin. “Ready to go again?”
  

  
She raised her violin and started a new song. People paused for a second or two to listen, then kept walking. We weren't going to make much money that way. Tasha was just doing this for pocket money, but I needed to pay rent. I was tired of contact juggling, though. I'd done that trick for an hour before Tasha joined me. Instead, I started pulling things from my sleeves. I produced a pink carnation and handed it to an old lady. She thanked me, but didn't stay for another trick. I pulled out a white silk handkerchief, waved it around, and made it disappear into my palm. A man in a business suit gave me a nod, but continued on.
  

  
I pulled out more handkerchiefs, five at a time, each a different color. I tossed and juggled them, letting them flutter in the air like butterflies. With a sharp tug, I produced a stream of handkerchiefs knotted together. It twirled an coiled and hung in the air longer than gravity should have let it. A trio of middle-aged women, their arms full of shopping bags, paused to admire my work. I pulled a lavender handkerchief from the middle woman's shopping bag, and she gasped and giggled. I held their attention for almost ten minutes, pulling handkerchiefs from the women's purses, pockets, sleeves, and hair. All the while, Tasha played a cheerful jig. At last, they moved on, leaving almost thirty dollars in change.
  

  
Tasha never asked how I did my tricks. I think she knew I wouldn't tell her. The truth was, I didn't quite know myself. My mother used to say that my birth had been touched by the yokai. A second generation immigrant from Osaka, Japan, she was superstitious in a way that was reminiscent of long ago times, before technology, when spirits and faith were all that people had to turn to when things got tough. She never acted like it was strange that I could do things that were a little bit more than normal. When I imagined that the world was just slightly different, and caused it to be so. She never used the word magic, and neither did I. Some things are better left unsaid.
  

  
I spotted a gaggle of teenagers approaching, and nudged Tasha. Then I started a new routine. I pulled a square of origami paper out of my pocket and folded it into a crane. I stepped in front of one of the girls, shooting her a flirtatious smile. She glanced at her friends and giggled. I held out my crane, pulling on the tail to make the head bob and the wings flap. She rolled her eyes at me. I let go, allowing the paper crane to rest in my palm. It kept moving. Now she looked interested. I offered her the crane, and pulled out more paper, folding it into a frog. I pushed down on its rear, making it hop across my hand. Then it hopped off the end of my hand, landed right-side-up on the sidewalk, and took four more hops before stopping. A boy bent and picked it up, turning it over, examining it for evidence of how the trick worked. He didn't find any. 
  

  
Finally, I turned to a girl with a blue butterfly tattooed on her forearm. I found a sheet of paper almost the same color as her tattoo and folded it into a paper butterfly. Her face lit up as it waved its wings lazily.
  

  
“Look closely,” I said. She leaned in. I cupped the origami between my two palms, blew on it, then threw my hands apart. A live butterfly fluttered there for a moment, glittering azure, then darted off into the sky. The kids shrieked in amazement. Even Tasha's playing faltered for a split second. I didn't do that trick often. It was too obviously impossible, too difficult to explain away as anything other than real magic. Which it was.
