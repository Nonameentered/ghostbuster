Suite 213

&#x200B;

On the pleasant shore of the French Riviera, about half way between Marseilles and the Italian border, stands a large, proud, rose-colored hotel. At the time of this story, I had worked there for five years, as the personal assistant to the owner, Madame Janvier. It wasn't paradise, but it suited me.
  

  
“Noelle,” Madame said to me one April morning, “Please fetch three chairs from Suite 213 for the dinner tonight.”
  

  
Due to its nature, Suite 213 was used only for storage and miscellaneous functions, never for guests. I unlocked the door and opened it just enough to peep inside. I saw a parquet-floored ballroom with a well-stocked bar along one wall. Wrong room. I closed the door and turned the key again. This time, it opened into a walled garden. Nope. I tried again, and was greeted by the courtyard of a ruined medieval castle. Definitely not. One more time. At last, the door opened into an ordinary hotel suite, cluttered with boxes and unused furniture.
  

  
I muscled the chairs into the lift and down to the foyer. Just then, the front doors burst open, and an American couple sauntered in. Their clothes were ritzy, and they clearly thought they were the bee's knees. The wife grabbed my arm and ordered me to carry their luggage, then threw her coat at me. That was my introduction to the Hutchinsons.
  

  
Over the next two months, the Hutchinsons came and went in the company of wealthy, fawning, gullible people. They were grifters, con artists. Charles Hutchinson was gregarious and overly familiar, and couldn't keep his hands off the ladies. Mrs. Hutchinson, who would not permit “the help” to call her by her given name, was a kitten with anyone she thought she could get something out of, and disdainful of everyone else. I don't know which of them I hated more.
  

  
Madame trusted me, and only me, with the strange contents of Suite 213. I had broken this trust only once, when Madame had caught me necking with my sweetheart in its garden. “There are all kinds of love in this world but never the same love twice,” she'd said to me. “So I forgive you. But don't let it happen again.”
  

  
One afternoon, Madame sent me for a bottle of fine brandy from Suite 213. The door opened into the ballroom on the second try. A party was in full swing, with people in fine clothes drinking and dancing to jazz music. I squeezed through the crowd, retrieved a bottle from behind the bar, and slipped back out, only to bump into Charles.
  

  
"You gonna let me into that party, toots?" he asked, his hand shamelessly brushing my rear.
  

  
I squirmed away from him. "Sorry, sir. It's a private party." I sidestepped into the lift, making my escape.
  

  
A few nights later, I had to go to Suite 213's garden. I had a bottle of wine so cheap it was practically vinegar. A very drunk Charles stumbled into me as I was getting out the key, and snatched the bottle out of my hand. Mercifully, the door opened to the garden on the first try, and I ducked inside, slamming the door in his face.
  

  
I grabbed a shovel and dug up the box I'd buried beneath the sundial last month. Then, it had been full of pennies. Now gold and silver coins gleamed inside. That was the power of the garden. Leave something worthless, and after a month it transformed into something valuable. I'd been planning to bury the wine bottle, but now I would have to find something else to bury here and I wished it could be Charles.
  

  
Both Hutchinsons were out in the hallway when I emerged. They saw the box, heard the clinking. “Darling!” Mrs. Hutchinson crooned. “Does your mistress have a secret safe in there?”
  

  
But just then, Madame Janvier appeared on the stairs, and the two Americans scrammed back to their room.
  

  
The next time I had to go to Suite 213, I was assaulted from behind. A hand pressed a rag over my nose and mouth. I smelled ether, my vision swam, and my knees buckled. Charles retrieved my key.
  

  
“What kinda hokum is this?” he asked as they opened the door and gawked at the medieval courtyard. Then they spied the chest full of treasure at the far end.
  

  
I didn't warn them. They deserved what they were about to get. As they approached the chest, the piles of old bones littering the courtyard began to rattle, and a dozen skeletons shambled upright. The Hutchinsons shrieked and ran for the door, but it slammed shut, trapping them. I could still hear them inside. "It isn’t fair, it isn’t right,” Mrs. Hutchinson screamed, and then they were upon her.

I really had to fight with the word limit on this one. If you would like to read the original, longer version of this story, I have posted it on r/HallOfDoors
