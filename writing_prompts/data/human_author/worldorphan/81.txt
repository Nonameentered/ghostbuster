Carmen packed the rest of the paintings into plastic tubs. She could take them to the gallery tomorrow. The lighthouse painting, though, she took home with her. She propped it up on a desk, planning to hang it later.

Carmen studied the haunting painting. And blinked in surprise. Had it changed? She could have sworn that before the lighthouse lamp had been lit, shining its encouraging yellow beam across the waves and the shore. But now the top of the lighthouse was as dark as the sea below. That was ridiculous. She must have been remembering wrong. But when she came back into the room later, the painting had changed again. A line of eerie green-white had spread along the beach beneath the lighthouse, where the surf hit the sand.

The more she looked at that pale line, the more the whorls and brushstrokes seemed to take on shapes. Just her eyes messing with her, she told herself. And she just hadn't noticed that odd surf-line before. She forced her attention away from the painting, distracting herself for several minutes before the urge to look became too great.

The change was undeniable. The painting now showed a host of ghostly figures lined up on the beach. As she stared, they moved, slowly but surely, up the beach, into the foreground of the painting, following the path that led from the beach to the lighthouse door.

Carmen had a flash of memory. Coming into her grandfather's study to find him touching up a painting he had finished months ago. “Sometimes,” he'd told her, “I look at one of these later and find it didn't turn out the way I meant it to. When that happens, I try to fix it. Of course, sometimes, I have to fix it from the inside.”
