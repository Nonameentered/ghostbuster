**The Good Folk**
  

  
“Preposterous!” Father Randal snarled. Col and Eda cringed, holding their son tighter. “How could my predecessor agreed to such heathen nonsense?”
  

  
Father Randal had only become priest of the village of Whitby a year ago, after old Father Edwin died. This was his first time hearing about Whitby's contract with the Good Folk. All summer, the Faeries would make the village crops flourish. In return, the village would give the Good Folk a baby. If only one child was born in a year, the could keep it, but if there was more than one, the last child born was owed to the Faeries on the first night of autumn. That was tonight.
  

  
“We're not asking you to break the contract,” Col said timidly. “We just want you to pray with us and little Jack, before we give him away.”
  

  
“Absolutely not! The Church does not bargain with faeries and demons. You will keep your baby. Go home and pray, and I shall pray as well.”
  

  
“What if the Good Folk punish us?” Eda asked. But they did as they were told. They laid an iron poker over their son's crib. It should have been a rowan branch, inviting the faeries to take him.
  

  
The faeries were clearly displeased. Over the next few days, apples withered on trees and grain rotted in the barn. Father Randal insisted  they just needed faith.
  

  
“Father,” Eda pleaded, “if things keep going this way, there won't be enough left to get us through the winter. Which is the greater sin? Giving the child I love away to the Faeries, or endangering my village, perhaps all of the kingdom, by failing to honor a pact?”
  

  
Randal stared at her. “What is wrong with you, woman? Do you *want* your baby taken away?”
  

  
“Of course not! But I don't want us to starve, either! I could lose Jack either way, and other mothers could lose their children, too. Faced with this choice, Father, there's only one answer.”
  

  
“Nonsense!” Randal snarled. “Tonight, I will sit vigil by your child's crib. These demons will learn they are not welcome in Whitby.
  

  
Shortly after midnight, a strange being emerged from the chimney of Col and Eda's home, a youthful fellow with pointed ears and an elongated nose. Randal, Eda, and Col, who had all been kneeling in prayer, bolted to their feet. In his crib, baby Jack slept on.
  

  
Randal brandished a large iron cross. “Foul imp! Your days of tormenting the good people of this village are over!”
  

  
 “My kith have a bargain with these villagers," the faerie replied. "A trade of favors. This was something agreed upon long ago. The old priest, he approved.”
  

  
“Father Edwin may have been willing to bargain with demons, but I won't stand idly by while Satan steals the souls of my parishioners.”
  

  
The faerie's face went scarlet. “You babbling fool! The Fae owe no allegiance to Satan! We've been good neighbors to the people of Whitby. We've played our role; now it's time for some reciprocation.”
  

  
Suddenly, there was a rattling at the window. The faerie started, his temper suddenly cooled. “Sarah, I told you not to follow me.”
  

  
A little girl with tiny deer antlers peeked over the sill. “I'm sorry Robin,” she said, climbing in through the window. “I just wanted to see my new brother. Is this him?” She took a step toward the crib, but drew back when she saw the iron poker.
  

  
Eda's hand went to her mouth. “Sarah. You're Joan's daughter.” She crouched down in front of the child. “I knew you as a baby. Your mother loved you very much.”
  

  
“My faerie mother loves me now. She can't have her own babies, you know.” She grinned. “And Robin's getting me a brother. Right, Robin?”
  

  
Eda looked from Sarah to Robin, and then to her husband. “Look at her, Col. She's healthy, clean, well fed. No longer human, but still . . .”
  

  
He nodded. “And she's loved.” He lifted their sleeping son from his crib. Jack cooed, and snuggled against his father.
  

  
They turned to the priest. Had they gone mad? Were they really going to give away their child without a fight? And yet. Life was hard, dangerous. In many places, children died of hunger and sickness. But in Whitby, they had plenty to eat, and their children flourished like their crops. All thanks to the Fae. Maybe this contract was necessary.
  

  
He tossed the iron poker into a corner. Col and Eda handed little Jack to Robin and Sarah. The girl stroked the infant's hair, enraptured. Then the three of them turned on the spot and vanished. Eda and Col held each other, fighting back tears. The debt had been squared, for another year.
