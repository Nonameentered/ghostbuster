**The Cave Is Hungry**
  

  
Gilbert clung to the broken spar, all that was left of his ship. The storm had done for her, and the rest of his shipmates. If anyone else survived, they were miles away, clinging to their own flotsam and saying their own prayers. It was hours, maybe days, before the storm spent the worst of its fury and Gilbert could do more than fight to keep his head above water. The sea surrounded him endlessly on all sides, a glittering splendor of blue and silver. Then his heart leapt as he saw a shadow on the horizon. An island.
  

  
At last, Gilbert collapsed onto a sandy beach and succumbed to sleep. Thirst woke him. Before him lay a thick jungle, rising up to a central peak. He made his way inland and found a stream of crisp, fresh water. That was when he saw the idol.
  

  
It was a four-foot-high pillar of wood carved from the stump of a small tree, the top portion shaped into a crude head. Heavy brows, thick lips, broad nose, and decorated with shapes and swirls. There were more, a line of them, about fifty feet apart. Each face wore a different savage expression. He followed them until, peeking between the trees, he found a cluster of houses. The prospect of food and shelter was enticing. Then again, what if the inhabitants were hostile, or even cannibals? He crept cautiously forward.
  

  
The village was small, perhaps twenty huts. They were round, constructed from upright logs with mud and grass between them. The roofs were thatched with dried palm fronds and more mud. Their only furniture consisted of woven mats and baskets. 
  

  
The village was completely deserted. Debris had drifted into the buildings, and vines climbed the walls and twisted through the thatching. What had happened to all the people? Had they all died of some disease? Been killed by wild animals, or a neighboring tribe? Maybe they had sailed away in boats. There was an unnatural stillness to the vacant houses. Ghosts lingered here. 
  

  
Gilbert was exhausted. He lay down in one of the houses and went to sleep. The leering faces of the idols and the whispering voices of the lost natives haunted his dreams
  

  
The next day, Gilbert explored the island. He discovered more trails of idols. One led to a bay where a fleet of rude fishing boats sat broken and decaying on the beach. The other trail led inland, through the jungle, and ended at the mouth of a cave. “Mouth” was the operative word, for the stone around it was carved into a face, in the same style as the idols. It's eyes were huge stone hemispheres surmounted by angry brows, and the cave entrance itself was a gaping mouth filled with heavy square teeth beneath thick lips. Was it screaming in fury, or yawning with hunger? Gilbert couldn't tell.
  

  
A chill breeze drifted from the cave mouth, as if it were breathing. From its depths, Gilbert heard an unsettling murmuring and whispering. It could have been the sound of trickling water or stirring air. Yet he had the impression of voices calling to him, enticing him to step into the darkness. Cold fingers of dread closed around his heart, and he fled blindly from that place.
  

  
Days passed. Gilbert claimed one of the huts as his own. He found an abandoned spear and attempted to fish with it. That could have gone better. But his technique improved with practice, and soon he was eating tasty meals of fire-roasted fish and fruit. 
  

  
The cave and the voices inside it filled his nightmares, and his waking hours as well. He became convinced that one by one or in mass, the missing villagers had gone into that gaping mouth. Where were they now? Down in the depths, living in the dark? Gone through a hole in the world into a distant place? Or had they been consumed by the spirit behind that voracious stone face?
  

  
Though he tried to avoid it, the cave drew him to it like true north draws the needle of a compass. He could hear the voices all the time, drifting through the jungle, carried on the wind. “Join us, here, within. It is hungry. It must be fed. Come and be eaten.”
  

  
Without meaning to, Gilbert found himself standing before the cave entrance. The voices resonated in his very bones. A horrible desire overtook him. He needed to know what had become of the people the cave had consumed. He needed to see. Deep inside him, a small, sane cognizance shuddered in horror. But its concerns were drowned out by the pull of the cave, inevitable as the tides. 
  

  
Gilbert passed beneath the hungry eyes and heavy teeth, and let the darkness swallow him up.
