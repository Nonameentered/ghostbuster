Spectrophobia is the fear of mirrors. Specifically, it's the fear of seeing something reflected in the mirror that shouldn't be there: a ghost or apparition sharing space with you, or your the idea that your reflection isn't actually your reflection, but a separate entity that moves on its own. It sounds silly. I knew it was silly, completely irrational even. Knowing this did absolutely nothing to make the fear go away.
  

  
Usually, I could deal with my phobia. As long as the room was brightly lit, I could stand to look in mirrors if I had to. Normally, I'd avert my eyes as much as possible, and that got me by. I felt a little anxious looking at my reflection long enough to get myself ready in the mornings, but I could manage.
  

  
That was before the powers began. Before the news reports started coming in. There was the man with arachnophobia who was mugged in a parking lot. Just as the thug pulled a knife on him, all these giant spiders poured out from under the cars. The mugger ran off, and the guy was saved. He had to be hospitalized for a week to treat his anxiety, though.
  

  
The lady with the fear of heights wasn't so lucky. She started levitating, and couldn't figure out how to go back down. Up and up she went, screaming. At about 300 feet, she finally passed out from her panic attack. Her power stopped functioning, she fell, and she died.
  

  
After reading these, and many more reports, my spectrophobia grew ten times worse. I didn't know how my power might manifest, and I didn't want to find out. I didn't dare look in a mirror, even in the brightest light.
  

  
I started getting comments at work about my unprofessional appearance. Without a mirror, I had no idea what I looked like. I did my best with my makeup. I put on foundation and could only hope I'd blended it properly. I attempted lipstick, but eye makeup was impossible. I could comb my hair, but I couldn't style it. One day I got daring and braided it. Apparently it did not turn out well.
  

  
Using the restroom was the worst. In my own house, I was familiar enough with the layout of my bathroom that I could get to the toilet, and then to the sink to wash my hands, with my eyes closed. At work, though, I really struggled. I would dart into the bathroom and into the nearest stall without making eye contact with the mirror. I had to carry a big bottle of hand sanitizer in my purse, because I didn't dare approach the sinks. They had mirrors over them. Some of my co-workers noticed. I couldn't bring myself to explain. As embarrassing as my behavior was becoming, being afraid of mirrors was even more humiliating. Every time I started to tell them about it, I thought of the onslaught of ugliness jokes they would make, and I couldn't do it.
  

  
There was this guy at my office. Ted. Ted was a major creeper. He spent way too much time staring at the women in our office. He lingered near our cubicles instead of returning to his own work. If he had to pass one of us in the halls or the aisles, he would pass as closely as possible, trying to arrange it so that his hands would brush – well, I'll just let you guess. We reported him to Human Resources, but nothing was ever done.
  

  
One evening, I had to stay late working on a project that had gotten a bit out of hand. Everyone else had left, and most of the lights had been turned off. I finally wrapped it all up and shut off my computer. When I turned around, I saw a figure standing in the darkened hallway. Ted. He stepped into the light, leering.
  

  
“Ted. I didn't know you were still here. Uh, well, have a good night.” I headed toward the front door.
  

  
Ted stepped directly into my path. “No need to rush off, Gloria. Heh. I know what everybody's been saying, but I like your new natural look. You, uh, you look really hot. You know, I've been working out. Wanna see my abs?” He started to untuck his shirt.
  

  
“I need to get home,” I said, trying to push past him.
  

  
He grabbed my arm. “What's the rush? It's not like you're married. We could go out. You and me. You think I'm attractive, right?”
  

  
I tried to squirm out of his grip. He got a hurt look on his face, then drew back his other hand and slapped me across the face. I struggled harder. He reached into his jacket. Before I could find out what he had in there, I kneed him in the crotch and ran in the opposite direction.
  

  
Cursing that I hadn't paid more attention during office fire drills, I racked my brain to recall where the next nearest exit was. Ted pounded after me. A gun flashed in his hand. Was he really going to shoot me? I ducked into a hallway, but I'd gotten turned around. I was outside the bathrooms, and the hall hit a dead end after that. 
  

  
Ted stepped into the entrance. He pointed the gun at me. His hand was shaking like crazy. Panicking, I shoved my way into the ladies room. 
  

  
Oh, no. The mirrors. 
  

  
My eyes fell on the glass before I could stop myself. For a second, I saw my reflection staring back at me. I had dark circles under my eyes, and my hair was a wild mess. Then, the horrified look on my face stretched into a wide grin.
  

  
Oh, no.
  

  
I ducked into a stall and slammed the door behind me. I crouched into the corner behind the toilet, making myself as small as I could. The ladies room door slammed open. 
  

  
“Why are you running? Why can't women ever give me a chance!” Ted howled. The gun went off. Bathroom tiles shattered above my head. I stifled a scream.
  

  
There was a bang. Ted had kicked open the door of the first stall. I crawled under the partitions to the farthest one. He kicked another door open. It was only a matter of time before he reached me.
  

  
“Hey! How did - ” Ted said in surprise. Then there was a weird, squelching noise. Something red spattered the floor at Ted's feet. He collapsed. His head lolled toward me, his eyes open and staring blankly, his mouth frozen in an 'O' of horror. 
  

  
I cracked the door and peeked out.
  

  
She was still there.
  

  
My reflection stood in the middle of the room, Ted's blood dripping from her fingers. She winked at me. Then she climbed up onto the sink and stepped into the mirror and was gone. The only thing reflected in it was the empty bathroom.
