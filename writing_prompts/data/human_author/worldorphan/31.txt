I've never done these tasks before, but I've been slack lately, and could use some accountability.  So. . . .

1&2) Do the two mod tasks. I think I'm gonna be weak and not try to go entirely without dialogue tags, though. My flaky attention span demands clarity, and dialogue where I lose track of who is speaking really bothers me.

3) Write at least three posts each week. I'm gonna let my serial count for one of these, though.

4) Edit at least 30 pages of my novel.

I don't know if all this is too ambitious or not. We shall see.
