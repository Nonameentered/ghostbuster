I want to tell you a story.
  

  
A while back, I had this recurring dream. I'd be walking somewhere, like a park, or a playground, or a school. I could hear children laughing, but the place was empty. No children in sight. Then I would hear a voice. I thought it was a woman, or a girl. She would always say “come find me. I'll be waiting.” Then I would wake up.
  

  
One morning, when I woke from the dream, I remembered a detail I hadn't seen before. That time, my walk had ended under a massive elm tree. I knew that tree. It sat in the yard behind our old townhouse, the one I rented right after college. That was our tree. We used to sit under it all the time, reading, talking about the future. It was where you first kissed me, where I gave you the keys to my apartment, where first I told you I was pregnant. 
  

  
I shied away from that thought. It was too painful.
  

  
Still, that dream stirred me so powerfully that I couldn't let it go. It was my day off from work. I got in my car and drove out to the part of town where we used to live, to the old townhouse with the elm tree out back. It wasn't as nice as the subdivision we moved to later, with our huge lawn and our roomy two-story colonial. It was dingy and cramped, but we had been so happy there. Full of hope.
  

  
I parked on the street and walked behind the building. Somebody else lived there now, and I hoped they didn't mind me being in their yard. I examined the tree. It had grown taller and broader since I'd last seen it. But our initials were still there, where you carved them into the flat spot where a limb had been cut off. “K+C Always.” I sat down under it and gazed up at the house. I could see into the window on the second story, into the room that was going to be our nursery.
  

  
It hurt to think about, but I couldn't stop myself.
  

  
When I found out I was pregnant, I was so excited. We bought the a crib and a changing table; we decorated and painted. I had my first ultrasound, and they told us we were having a girl. We filled a dresser full of frilly little outfits and teeny tiny socks. We decided to name her Isabelle, after my grandmother, but also agreed that we would call her Bella. 
  

  
The doctor had recommended a second ultrasound, to double-check some abnormalities. But I wasn't worried. Not until they told us about the defects. Still, we convinced ourselves that everything would be fine. I went into labor, and four hours later, Bella was born. She was so beautiful! But they wouldn't let me hold her. They whisked her away to surgery immediately. They did their best. It wasn't enough. There was just too much wrong. I wished they had let me hold her, just for a minute, because now I never would. 
  

  
That had been a long time ago. If Bella had lived, I considered, she would be going to prom soon.
  

  
I stood, intending to go home. What had I been thinking, coming here? But something had changed. That flat spot on the tree, where the limb was missing, it wasn't a flat spot any more. It was a hole. It seemed the tree had grown larger, because I was sure that I could fit inside that hole, if I tried. What a stupid thought. Even if I could, why would I do such a thing? What was I, a squirrel? Still, I thought I saw something inside the hole, so I reached my hand in . . .
  

  
Suddenly, I was falling into that dark hole. I fell and fell, through darkness, and then light, until finally I splashed down into water. It seemed as vast as an ocean. The water around me was rosy from the setting sun that rippled through the waves above me. I swam towards the surface. I swam and I swam as the light deepened to blood red, then dulled to silver under the moonlight. I was still no closer to the surface.
  

  
My lungs were bursting for air, but my arms wouldn't move any more. "Some things are impossible," I thought. I allowed myself to sink.
  

  
Deep in the black water, my feet touched solid ground. I opened eyes I hadn't realized I had closed. I was standing on a stone path. All around me was barren, brittle yellow grass and black leafless trees. I didn't know where I was supposed to go, so I just followed the path in the direction I was facing. It began to slope upward, and I realized I was ascending an enormous hill. I could see something green at the top. I climbed for what might have been hours, until my legs shook beneath me and I felt I could not take another step. But I did take another, and another. Step after step, I forced myself to go on.
  

  
At last I crested the peak and found myself in a garden of unsurpassed beauty. Blossoming trees trembled their leaves and petals in the light breeze. Flowers of every color and design lined the stone paths that crisscrossed between hedges and arbors. It was silent, though. Not a bird or a squirrel chirped or stirred.
  

  
Presently, I came to a sort of patio with a statue in the center. At least, it used to be a statue. It had been shattered. I sifted through the pieces, trying to puzzle out what it used to be. I thought it might be a flower, or maybe a girl in a wide, flowing skirt, although if it was a girl, I couldn't find the pieces to her face. I noticed an earthenware jar of something white and thick sitting nearby. I checked, and discovered that it was glue. I dragged it over to the pieces of the statue, and attempted to glue them back together. But I couldn't make the shapes match up. And while I was looking for the right pieces, the ones I had already glued together kept tipping over and breaking apart again. I kept trying until I was in tears from frustration.
  

  
“Some things can't be fixed, you know.” 
  

  
I turned toward the voice to find a teenage girl sitting on a bench. Her hair was chestnut brown and curled on the ends, like mine. Her eyes were exactly like my husband's. She wore a long formal dress in the precise shade of pale pink that we had painted the nursery in our little townhouse with the elm tree out back.
  

  
“Bella?” I whispered.
  

  
She smiled. “I knew you would find me.” She came over to me and put a hand on my arm. “I know you've been sad for a long, long time. I just wanted you to know, it wasn't your fault. It wasn't anyone's fault. And I wanted you to know that I know how much you love me.”
  

  
I tried to speak, but no words would come. Finally, I managed to ask, “so, is this Heaven?” 
  

  
“No.”
  

  
“Then, are you . . .”
  

  
“This isn't where I am all the time. This is just an in-between place. Just for you and me.” She smiled. I put my arms around her. I wanted to hold her forever.
  

  

  
Then I woke up. I had been sleeping under the tree behind the old townhouse. My cheeks were crusted with salt from where tears had dried.
  

  

  
That was a long time ago. If Bella had lived, she might have been married by now, with a family of her own, or a career that would make us proud. We'll never know. But all the years I've spent missing the child I never had were years that I spent with you, so I don't regret them. Not at all.
  

  
I want to tell you something. I want to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry I let the cancer take me. I just couldn't fight anymore. Everyone has their limits, you know? It wasn't my fault. And it wasn't your fault, either. I feel bad, though, for leaving you all alone. 
  

  
That's why I want you to know that you are not alone. Not really. 
  

  
I know you won't remember most of what I've told you. But I will tell you again, as may times as I have to. And one day, you'll wake up from the dream, and you'll know what to do.
  

  
Come find me. I'll be waiting.
