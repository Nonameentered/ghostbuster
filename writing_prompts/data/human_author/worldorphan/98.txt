**Strangers in a Prison**
  

  
*“Magic holds aloft the stones of our floating kingdom, as it holds the Great Mages high above the subjects they rule. If a little of the earth at the base of the island crumbles and falls into the abyss, who will notice? Not the Mages.”*

Footsteps approached my cell. The door opened, and the guards dumped a woman inside. She lay in a heap on the floor, sobbing. The back of her shirt was torn open, revealing bloody whip-marks. Gently, I laid my hands on her. I pulled magic from my heart and my blood and into my fingers, shaping it like wool on a spindle. I threaded the magic into her wounds, stitching them closed.
  

  
She raised her head. She was Singole, servant caste, like me. Rounded features, rounded eyes, rounded ears. Her hands groped along her back; she stared at me, dumbfounded. “You did magic! How is that possible?”
  

  
The Singole were at the bottom of the caste structure of the Floating Isles of Glamourstone because our bloodlines were completely devoid of magic. The ruling caste, the Veningole, had the most powerful magic. The rest of our society, artisan, scholars, warriors, and so forth, were stratified beneath them, decreasing in status as they decreased in magical power. 
  

  
The door opened again. Archmagus Eilmenor, a pale-haired Veningole man, scrutinized us from the doorway. His hereditary magic displayed itself through the angular features, slanted almond eyes, and pointed ears of his caste. “Keya.” He spoke my name, and paused expectantly. I realized he was waiting for one of us to respond. Despite having officiated my trial, he didn't know which of us I was. All of us round-ears looked alike to the mages. 
  

  
My companion glanced at me, giving me away. Eilmenor's gaze fell upon me. “The council has decided the Ritual of Muil will be performed publicly, at midday tomorrow. As for you,” he inclined his head toward my cellmate. “Your branding will follow.” He exited the cell without further ado.
  

  
When he was gone, the woman turned to me. “So you're Keya? I'm Vianne.” She almost managed a smile. “What's the Ritual of Muil?”
  

  
“They remove your magic.”
  

  
“Does it hurt?”
  

  
“Horribly. But what's worse, a person's magic is linked to their soul. Remove it, and it breaks them. I knew an artist, once, whose paintings offended a Veningole. After his magic was removed as punishment, he could never paint again. He said the whole world looked gray to him. He eventually killed himself.”
  

  
“How is it you have magic, anyway?”
  

  
I shrugged. “My mother would never say who my father was. Clearly, he wasn't Singole.” Marriage between those of different castes was strictly forbidden, a machination of the Veningole to keep magic power concentrated in a limited few. “What about you? Why are you being branded?”
  

  
“Theft. I have three children to support, and my mistress keeps making up excuses not to pay me properly, punishing me for things that were out of my control. So I stole from her.”
  

  
I nodded in understanding. Without the magic to fight back, the powerless Singole would always be treated unfairly. This was just the way things were.
  

  
“This Ritual of Muil,” Vianne asked me suddenly. “What happens if they cast it on someone who doesn't have any magic?”
  

  
“I'm not sure. Nothing, probably. Why?”
  

  
“Well,” she said tentatively, “that archmage can't tell us apart, right? So, why don't we swap places? I'll take your punishment, and you take mine.”
  

  

  
Midday came at last. Guards conducted us to Judgment Square. It was cold, the sky heavy and gray. They put us in the pillory. Archmage Eilmenor addressed the crowds, recounted our wickedness. He raised his staff and began to chant. Vianne screamed as he touched the staff to her forehead, then fell limp. My heart thudded in my ears. What if he sensed that his spell was failing, that Vianne had no magic to take?
  

  
Oblivious, Eilmenor turned from Vianne to me. He produced a glowing brand and pressed it to my face. My vision went white with agony for a moment. But then it was over. 
  

  
We were made to stand in the pillory for an hour as people threw stones and rotten vegetables at us. Then the guards released us. My arm around Vianne, we ducked through the crowd, running until we reached the blind end of an alley. 
  

  
“I'm all right,” Vianne told me. “I don't feel any different. My strength is returning.”
  

  
I smiled, and touched the brand on my face, energy from my fingers soothing the burned flesh. It wouldn't even scar. We had our freedom. I had my magic. And no one but us knew the difference.
