“Hi, Lisa,” my husband Ryan called to me as I came into the house after my Saturday shift at the hospital. “Come see what I've been up to.” He waved his arm proudly at the wall.
  

  
“It looks great,” I told him. He had hung the painting we'd bought on our vacation to San Francisco. 
  

  
“I had to rearrange some of the other things to make room for it. But I didn't take anything down.”
  

  
I nodded. The painting of the Golden Gate Bridge, with a young couple in the foreground, now dominated the wall over the couch. But the wedding photos surrounding it were exactly where they had always been. He'd just swapped one large painting for another “Where's the lighthouse picture?” 
  

  
“In the upstairs hallway.” He took me up there and showed me. “I moved those flower photos from Mom to the empty space in the kitchen. And I shifted those paintings from your great uncle Dafydd.”
  

  
My mom's uncle Dafydd has passed away three years ago, and he had left me the two paintings in his will. I'd wondered why me and not my mom, but it was probably because my parents, now retired, had sold their large home, bought a tiny condo, and spent most of their time traveling the country in their RV. So I was the one with the big house with plenty of wall space for weird old paintings. 
  

  
The paintings were very old. They'd been painted by my ancestor, Niclas ap Celyn, back in the late 1600's, before the family had immigrated from Wales. One was titled “The Guardian,” and depicted a woman wearing armor and holding a sword at the ready. The other was titled “The Warlock.” It showed a man in black robes embroidered with strange symbols. I'd always found it a little creepy.
  

  
I frowned. “Didn't Great Uncle Dafydd say in his will that the pictures should always be hung facing each other?” Before Ryan's project today, they had been hung directly opposite each other in the upstairs hallway. But now the lighthouse painting was opposite the Guardian, and Warlock was further down, between our son's room and the bathroom.
  

  
Ryan laughed. “Dafydd was pretty eccentric.” 
  

  
“Yeah.” I tried to shrug it off, but something about the two paintings made me inexplicably uneasy. The Warlock had the corners of his mouth turned up in a tiny smile that made my skin crawl. “Hey, Ryan? I could swear this guy used to look grumpier.”
  

  
He looked at it, a puzzled expression on his face. “Huh. Mandela effect?”
  

  
“I guess so,” I shrugged. “Well, I think you did a great job,” I said, forcing myself to perk up. “What do you want to do for dinner?”
  

  
\------------------------
  

  
"I don't like that picture," my son told me the next morning as he was getting ready for school. He'd never said a word about it when it had been beside his older sister's room. "I don't like the way he looks at me."
  

  
I didn't say anything. I tried not to encourage Reese's overactive imagination, but the painting still unnerved me as much as it had the previous night. Also, there were a wooden bowl and a pair of candles on the table in the painting, which I did not remember being there before.
  
The morning after that, I couldn't find my favorite necklace. It had a pendant shaped like a dove and was made of real gold. It had been a gift from Ryan on our fourth wedding anniversary. As I was carrying some laundry up to Reese's room that evening, I stopped, and stared at the warlock painting in horror. There was a weird circular design drawn on the table, which had definitely not been there before, and beside it was a gold necklace that looked exactly like mine.
  

  
I mentioned none of this to Ryan. It was too crazy to say out loud.
  

  
That night I awoke from a dream that I could not remember, except that it had been very disturbing. I went out into the hallway, thinking about going downstairs to get some juice. For some reason, my feet carried me over to the warlock painting. I blinked and rubbed my eyes. I almost turned on the hallway light, but I didn't want to wake anyone. I didn't want anyone else to see this. It was too insane. And even in the dark, there was no denying what I saw. The painting was empty. The man was gone.
  

  
Something caught my eye at the opposite end of the hall. The woman in the other painting was moving. She waved her arms at me, and mouthed inaudible words. It touched the painting, half expecting my fingers to go through it as if it were a window rather than a canvas. But as my fingers brushed the rough texture of dried oil-paint, I heard a voice as clearly as if it was speaking directly into my mind.
  

  
“What did you do?” she demanded. “How could you let this happen?”
  

  
“Whoa, wait a minute.” I snapped back. “What is happening, exactly? Last time I checked, paintings can't move or talk, so I think you've got some explaining to do first!”
  

  
“Don't you know about the binding spell? The man that owned these paintings before, he didn't tell you how the spell worked?”
  

  
“What spell? I don't even believe in spells! Or I didn't. All Great Uncle Dafydd told me was to keep the paintings facing each other. It wasn't even my idea to move them. My husband did it.”
  

  
The woman closed her eyes and pinched the bridge of her nose. “Old men and their secrets,” she mumbled. Then she straightened. “I am Aeronwy ap Gryffudd, Knight of the Shield and Star.”
  

  
“Could women even be knights in the sixteen hundreds?”
  

  
“For certain knighthoods. Don't interrupt. The man in the other painting is the Warlock Gwydyr. He was found guilty of a great number of heinous crimes, magical and mundane.” I noticed she spoke with a faint accent that I couldn't place. I supposed it could have been Welsh. “He had used the Dark Arts to make himself unkillable, but a group of magicians and knights managed to imprison him in that painting. I allowed myself to be placed into this painting to watch over him, lest he escape.” She glared at me. “But I can't very well watch over him if I can't even see him, now can I?”
  

  
“I didn't know. So where is he? What is he doing?”
  

  
“Gathering what he needs to conduct the ritual that will permanently free him from the painting. Your family is in danger. One of the components he needs is the blood of an innocent.”
  

  
“Morgan! Reese!” I bolted into my daughter's room. She was sound asleep, everything in her room just as it always was. I pushed open my son's door, and froze. The man from the painting stood just beyond the door. He, too, seemed frozen, and he was slightly transparent in the moonlight. He crouched, as if creeping through the room. In his hand he held one of our good kitchen knives. I tried to snatch it away from him, but my hand passed through both the knife and the man.
  

  
I rushed back to Aeronwy. “What do I do?”
  

  
“While he's still bound to the painting, he moves as slowly as a shadow. So we have some time. But not a lot. So listen closely, and do exactly what I tell you.”
