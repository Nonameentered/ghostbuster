**Reaching Out**

“Sometimes you need to scorch everything to the ground and start over,” I told the Matheson family. “But I don't think that's the case here.”
  

  
I'd felt the malevolence pressing upon me like a weight as soon Eric Matheson opened the front door. The house was old, and supernatural energy suffused its walls. I could see the traces of the entity's passage woven through every room. “Please, tell me more about your experiences.”
  

  
“Like I said on the phone, Ms. Valasek,” Eric's wife Gail began.
  

  
“Please, call me Sophie.”
  

  
“Sophie. There are sounds, whispers, mostly at night. And cold spots, and flickering lights.”
  

  
“And stuff moves. That's mainly why we called you, right Mom?” added Shelly, the Mathesons' teenage daughter.
  

  
“Right,” Gail continued. “Glasses get knocked over, dishes fly off shelves, pictures fall down. A week ago, a salt shaker hit Eric in the face!” 
  

  
I nodded. “Let me see what I can do.” I closed my eyes and focused my senses. Psychic ability had been in my family for generations, long before my grandmother immigrated to New England from the Old Country. I could sense malevolent intent surrounding myself and the family. I thought Gail might be its primary target. The presence itself, however,  was currently upstairs, watching us from the balcony. As I approached, it retreated to the master bedroom. 
  

  
I lit some sage and lifted up my rosary. I firmly told the spirit it was not welcome, and ordered it to leave. The presence shuddered mutinously and fell back to the bathroom, where it began to wreak havoc. Soap and toothbrushes scattered. The medicine cabinet exploded open, its contents a whirling tornado. Then it stopped, and everything clattered to the floor. A prescription bottle rolled through the doorway. Absently, I noted the prescription. Belsomra. Sleeping pills.
  

  
“Well,” I said, “Every time you find something that doesn't work, you're a step closer to what does work.” I told the Mathesons we should let the spirit calm down and try again another day.
  

  
I had an interest in the outsider. Spirits usually had a reason for their behavior. I researched the history of the house, but nothing caught my eye. So I went back two days later, prepared to ask the entity what, exactly, it wanted.
  

  
This time, Gail answered the door. Eric was working late. Oddly, the hatred I'd felt on my first visit was greatly diminished. I said as much.
  

  
“I think the ghost doesn't like Dad,” Shelly told me. She looked like she wanted to say more, but then withdrew into herself as if embarrassed. Or frightened.
  

  
I settled myself into a meditative trance, reaching out to the entity, encouraging it to communicate. I knew I was the underdog. It had no reason to talk to me. But I was hopeful. Suddenly a crash pulled me out of my trance.
  

  
We dashed toward the source of the sound. In the garage, a rusty storage cabinet banged and shook. Finally, its doors broke open.
  

  
“Huh,” said Shelly. “What does Dad need five containers of gasoline for?”
  

  
Gail shrugged. “The lawnmower?” Shelly didn't look convinced.
  

  
The next evening, I got a phone call from Shelly. 
  

  
“I know this is weird,” the girl said. “But I've got to talk to somebody, and I thought . . .”
  

  
“Go on.”
  

  
“My dad's having an affair. I came home early from school last month and walked in on him and this other lady . . . on the couch . . . you know . . . He said if I told my mom, he would find a way to make my life miserable. And I believe him.” There was genuine fear in her voice. “Anyway, he was acting so weird tonight. I'm sleeping over at my friend's house, and I wanted to cancel, but he wouldn't let me.  Something's not right.”
  

  
Following my gut, I parked my car outside the Matheson house and watched through binoculars. My gut was right. Eric and Gail had a few drinks, then went upstairs, arm in arm. Thirty minutes later, Eric came back downstairs alone, went into the garage, and went back upstairs with two containers of gasoline. I called 911, and prayed they would get there in time.
  

  
Now, I'm sitting in the police station, answering questions. I told them what I'd figured out, that the malevolence I'd felt hadn't come from the ghost at all, but from Eric. They don't believe I'm a medium, but all the evidence corroborates my story. Eric drugged his wife with sleeping pills, and was planning to burn down the house with her inside it, collect the insurance money, and run off with his paramour. The ghost's warning saved Gail's life. 
  

  
I'm not scared of ghosts. They're just stuck, and trying to communicate. But I am haunted by humans.
