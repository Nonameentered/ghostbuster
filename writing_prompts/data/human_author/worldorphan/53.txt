**Southern Selkies**

“Sofia, there's another storm coming. Maybe you shouldn't take the boat out today,” Monica told me over morning coffee.

I shook my head. “Between training sessions and bad weather, I  haven't been out to my sites in nearly two weeks.” She gave me a worried look. “It'll be fine. The storm's not due until evening. But it's supposed to last at least four days. So if I don't go now, that's another week of data lost.” I squeezed her hand. “I'll be careful.”

I packed up my gear and hiked across the tundra to the boat shed at the edge of Shirreff Cove. Then I set off over the waves, stopping at each predetermined location to take water samples. The image of Antarctica as a barren, frozen wasteland is one of nature's great deceptions. It's actually teeming with life, on land and especially in the ocean. My research involves the relationship between the fur seals and the microscopic organisms in the water. If science has taught me anything, it's that everything is connected.

I disembarked on San Telmo Island, to count the seals sunning themselves on the beach, and to take water samples from the tide pools. There's a history of violence here. As late as the early twentieth century, men hunted these seals for their fur, and the region's brutal weather did its best to retaliate.

As I gathered samples on the little islands on the far side of San Telmo, I noticed the storm clouds moving in much faster than anticipated. I should have returned to the base then, but I desperately wanted to finish my work. Fifteen minutes later, though, the wind was making me stagger, and the waves had grown huge.

It's easy to get turned around sailing through the South Shetlands under normal conditions, but with the air filled with sea spray and snow, navigation was impossible. The waves tossed my boat around like a twig. 

The boat flipped, trapping me underneath. There wasn't enough space to get my head above the frigid water. My life vest wouldn't allow me to dive deep enough to get out, and the waves slammed me violently. My lungs burned, and my body felt numb, and heavy, and glacially slow.

Something large but soft bumped into me. A seal wrapped its flippers around me, and with a powerful flick of its tail, hauled me free from the boat. I gulped air as my head broke the surface.

The seal kept one flipper around me. It raised the other one, which for a moment looked more like a human hand, to its face. It bowed its head, then pushed back a fur-lined hood to reveal a woman's face. She raised her head above the waves, and sang. The song had no words, but I sensed it had a purpose.  It might have been the noise of the storm, but I thought I heard another voice answer.

My need for oxygen briefly sated, I was once again aware of the brutal cold. It hammered against me, but now my body wouldn't even respond by shivering. I had no strength left. I let the cold and darkness take me.

I drifted, and I dreamed of ice and oceans and seals. And women dressed in furs swimming among the seals, keeping watch, protecting them. Calling to each other with their songs. And I slept.

When I woke, I was warm. I felt the touch of soft furs and, bizarrely, bare skin. I was naked, and lying on my side, and another woman, also naked, was lying with her arms wrapped around me and her warm body pressed against mine. A large fur blanket was wrapped snugly around both of us as we lay together on the floor. It wasn't erotic. It wasn't awkward or embarrassing, either. It was . . . comfortable. And tenders, and warm, and peaceful. I drifted back to sleep.

I woke briefly to the sound of singing. The strange woman and I were still wrapped together in the fur, and she was singing softly to me. It was the same voice, the same woman, who had rescued me from the ocean. The woman who was also a seal. 

At last, I woke completely. I was alone, and I was dressed again, my clothes dry. I ventured to the mouth of the cave I was in. The storm had ended, leaving the sky a clear and perfect blue. I took out my radio, still safely sealed in it's waterproof pouch in my pocket.

“Hello? This is Sofia Rojas calling Cape Shirreff Field Station. Can anyone hear me?” Help would be on the way soon. When they asked me how I survived, I would tell them it was a miracle, and let the seal women keep their secrets.
