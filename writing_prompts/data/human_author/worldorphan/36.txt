*\[Historical Notes: During Ming Dynasty* [Treasure Voyages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_treasure_voyages) *a fleet of 63 ships commanded by Admiral Zhen He, sailed from Nanjing down the coast of China, to Champa (Vietnam), across Indonesia (Java, Malacca, and Sumatra) to Sri Lanka (Ceylon) and the southern tip of India (Calicut). Zheng He wrote a famous report of his observation of* [St. Elmo's fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elmo%27s_fire) *on the ship's masts during a storm, attributing it to the divine intervention of the goddess Tianfei.\]*
  

  
We departed with the dawn tide. The rising sun spilled its golden light over the emerald peaks of Sumatra and the sapphire waves below them, glittering brighter than the Emperor's finest jewels. The view was breathtaking. But we were leaving all that behind us. 
  

  
In the many months since we departed from Nanjing, sailing south to Champa, then Java, then through the Straights of Malacca to Lamuri, we had always kept in sight of the coast. Now, however, Admiral Zheng He had ordered us to sail straight across the Western Ocean to Ceylon. We could expect no sign of land for two weeks, just an endless expanse of waves.
  

  
The deck was a bustle of activity. While some of us saw to the sails and lines, others moved crates and barrels into the hold. In Lamuri we had traded beautiful porcelain vessels for camphor and lakawood. The ship carried a delightful aroma as a result.
  

  
I was securing the some lines when someone stumbled into me. I recognized him Lambok Siregar, the envoy from Lamuri.
  

  
“I beg your pardon,” he said. “I am still getting my sea legs, as they say.”
  

  
“Perhaps you'd be more comfortable in your cabin, sir.”
  

  
“Certainly not. Do you know, young man, that I have never left the city in which I was born? I shall not miss this opportunity to see the great sights of the world.” Lambok staggered again as the ship rolled with a wave, and I caught him. He looked at me with alarm, perhaps afraid the ship was about to capsize, but seeing that I was calm, grinned bravely.
  

  
From that moment, I made it my mission to keep the intrepid Lamuri envoy out of trouble. He was always on deck and constantly underfoot. He took a liking to me as well, pestering me with questions about the operation of the ship. 
  

  
“Yang, why are the sails angled in such a way?” he would ask me. “Yang, how does the rudder work?” “Yang, how does the Admiral know in which direction to sail?” He had more questions than there were stars in the sky.
  

  
On the sixth day of our journey from Lamuri, a terrible storm caught up to us. The waves were as high as mountains, and the gales were strong enough to knock a man over. It took three men to control the rudder. We had to reef all but one of the sails so the winds wouldn't tear them apart. 
  

  
“Yang!” 
  

  
I turned at the sound of my name. Lambok was clinging to a rail beneath a storm lantern, grinning like a fool.
  

  
“You shouldn't be out here!” I shouted at him. “It's not safe, sir!” I grabbed his arm and attempted to drag him back to his cabin.
  

  
“I wanted to see what sailing in a storm was like! Why do – ”
  

  
Just then, a powerful wave struck the left hull, and the ship rolled. Lambok toppled into me and we tumbled across the deck. I grabbed a mast with one arm and hooked the other around his waist. With great effort, I hauled us both upright. Lambok was shaking with terror, but his grin hadn't faded.
  

  
Lightning crackled between the clouds like two dragons fighting. Just then, the top of the highest mast began to glow, like a pale blue lantern against the ink-black sky. 
  

  
Lambok tightened his grip on my arm. “What is happening?” 
  

  
“It's a sign from Tianfei, goddess of the sea! It means we have her blessing and protection!” 
  

  
My words seemed to sooth him. Though he still clung to me, his trembling eased. I felt his wild grin spread to my own face. 
  

  
I got the foolish envoy safely back to his cabin, then resumed my duties. Though the storm continued its ferocious attack on our ship, we worked with confidence, knowing the goddess was on our side. At long last, the winds abated and the waves calmed. The clouds broke apart, and a gentle half-moon shone down on the rolling waters.
  

  
As the sun was rising, Lambok found me sitting against the aft deck, weary from the night's efforts.
  

  
“Yang, I want to thank you for keeping me safe last night,” he said. “And for sharing your wisdom as we sail. Such adventures I have had, such sights! My life will never be the same for this experience.”
  

  
I nodded. It wasn't my first time at sea, but it was my first time visiting other lands and getting to know their people. Lambok's sense of wonder was contagious, and we still had the isle of Ceylon and the great markets of Calicut yet to see. This was an adventure that would change my life, as well.
