Mother died today. Or maybe, yesterday; I can't be sure. My mother, I mean, your great grandmother Rachel. As I write this, Sienna, I cannot help but wish you'd had more time with her. The coroner said she had a massive stroke, in her sleep, sometime between ten pm and five am. I found her this morning. I don't think she felt any pain. I hope not.
  

  
I had just seen her yesterday afternoon. Her dementia was like it always was. She thought she was a girl, and I was her mother. I stopped correcting her a while ago. It only upset her. She kept asking me to tell her a story. I told her about my Grandad's adventures serving in the Foreign Legion in Algeria, just the way he used to tell it, just the way my Grandma used to tell it after he passed. Now there was a man who knew how to live. You could tell from the way he told stories. And my Grandma, too, and my mother. They all had adventures. I wonder sometimes, how I failed to have any of my own, but I think I know why.
  

  

  
Dear Sienna,
  

  
I'm continuing this letter two days after I began it, on the day of your great grandmother's funeral. I want to give you my accounting of what happened, since your mother will surely tell you her own version. She was furious with me because I wasn't crying at the funeral. She thought I wasn't sad to see her grandmother pass. Girls love their grandmas. I understand. But I did all my crying already. And she was mad at me for refusing to view the body. But I saw the body already. I was the one who found it. And I realized I don't like seeing my mother's body without my mother in it. I'm sorry she made you look at it. I hope it wasn't too upsetting for you.
  

  
I think your mother believes the point of a funeral is to show everybody else how sad you are that the deceased has passed. I don't see the point in that. Your great grandma wouldn't have wanted that. She would have wanted us to celebrate her life, to be happy that she had lived a good one.
  

  
I wish your mother had let me spend a little time with you today. She and I had such a falling out, years ago. I was against her marrying her first husband, and I made the mistake of telling her so. I could tell that blackguard was going to break her heart and run out on her, just like my husband, her father, did to me. I was trying to protect her. She's never forgiven me for being right.
  

  
I hope I can get some absolution from her one day. I wasn't a perfect mother. She wasn't a perfect daughter. If I had it all to do over again, I might do it differently. And for all my failings, and all of hers, I've never loved her any less. I hope she knows that.
  

  
Sienna, you're too young now to understand any of this. I don't know how old you'll be when your mother let's you read these letters. I'll probably be gone by then. 
  

  
You probably expect me to caution you not to make the same mistakes I made. The same mistakes your mother made, or my mother. But I won't. I know you'll make your own unique and beautiful mistakes. I want you to make them. Don't hide from life. Don't hide from failure or heartbreak. Live to the point of tears. 
  

  
Enjoy those mistakes in their moments, then let them make you stronger, wiser, braver. Every moment is precious, the joyful ones, and the painful ones too. You never know where a choice will take you. When anything can happen, everything matters. A rose has thorns, but that doesn't keep it from being beautiful, and it shouldn't stop us from picking it.
  

  
I think that's enough advice for one night. Know that I love you very much, and I am proud of you, and of the woman you will one day become.
  

  
Sincerely,
  

  
Grandma Ruth
  

  
P.S.
  

  
Please don't think I am angry at your mother for keeping you from me. It breaks my heart, but I know she is trying to do her best by you, and I forgive her. Your mother and stepfather love you very much, and you are lucky to have them in your life.
  

  
It is late. I will write to you again soon. But now I must sleep.
