The ritual to release Aeronwy from her painting was simple enough. I made a little cut on my palm, pressed my hand against the canvas, and repeated the words she recited for me. They might have been Latin; I couldn't tell. The world went wobbly around me for a second, and then Aeronwy was standing beside me, armor, sword, and all. She was taller than me. I hadn't expected that. She was ghost-like, just as her counterpart had been, but she assured me that she would be able to touch Gwydyr just fine when the time came.
  

  
With her guidance, I gathered up everything we would need. By the time we returned to Reese's room with our supplies, Gwydyr had reached his bed, and was leaning over the sleeping child, his knife raised.
  

  
“Don't wake him,” Aeronwy warned me. “I'm not sure what could happen if you do. Gwydyr had some spells that could be cast merely through eye contact. He couldn't use them in the painting, but in this form, halfway free, I don't know what his capabilities are.”
  

  
I nodded, glad for the millionth time that my little boy was such a heavy sleeper. I quickly began setting up. I made a circle on the floor out of salt and set a glass salad bowl in the middle. Then I started adding things to the bowl. More salt, drips of wax from a lit candle, flower petals from my wilting Valentine's Day bouquet, ashes (we didn't have a fireplace so I had to burn up some of Reese's wooden blocks), and Old Bay seasoning (it was supposed to be plain cloves, but I didn't have any of that). I had to say a short rhyme after adding each ingredient. It wasn't in English, and Aeronwy made me say it over when I got it wrong. All the while, Gwydyr's knife inched closer to my son's neck.
  

  
As I threw the Old Bay into the bowl, the knife bit into my son's skin, and a ruby drop of blood appeared. It rolled onto his finger, and reality shuddered again, as it had when Aeronwy stepped out of her painting. Suddenly, Gwydyr moved like an ordinary person. He pulled a glass tumbler from his robe, but before he could turn back to Reese, Aeronwy's sword was hurtling toward him. He parried it with the knife. 
  

  
“Keep going!” she shouted.
  

  
I said the rhyme, carefully because I didn't want to do it twice. The knight and the warlock struggled for the knife. I grabbed the last ingredient, shavings of paint from Gwydyr's painting in a plastic cereal bowl. Aeronwy shoulder-checked Gwydyr. They both tumbled sideways, and Gwydyr's knife swung dangerously close to my arm. It was solid, even if he wasn't, and I jerked away. The paint flakes spilled out onto the carpet. I tried to pick them up again, but carpet was too shaggy. 
  

  
I sprang to my feet and raced out into the hall to get more. From the bedroom, I heard breaking glass. Aeronwy had smashed the tumbler with her sword. Even without a vessel, Gwydyr still seemed intent on slicing up my child. It was hard to look away long enough to do what I needed to do. With a table knife, I scraped more paint off the canvas. Then I raced back to the bowl and dumped them in. 
  

  
Aeronwy was bleeding from a long cut on her arm. I started chanting, got tongue-tied, and had to start over. Gwydyr swiped his fingers through the knight's blood and said a foul-sounding word. She cried out in pain and her knees buckled. The warlock snatched the water glass off Reese's nightstand and raised his knife.
  

  
I finished the chant. The mixture in the bowl started to glow. I grabbed a handful of it and threw it at Gwydyr. 
  

  
“No!” He screamed as it hit him. Then the world warped again.
  

  
Gwydyr was gone. So was Aeronwy. I staggered to my feet, scattering the salt circle and spilling the stuff in the bowl onto the carpet.
  

  
“Mommy?” Reese called plaintively from the bed. “I had a bad dream. Stay with me?”
  

  
I sat down on the bed, stroked his cheek, and kissed him. I cleaned the blood off his neck with a tissue. The cut was already closed, leaving only a thin pink line. I sat with my son until his slow, even breathing told me he was asleep.
  

  
Then I went out into the hall. Gwydyr was back on his canvas, looking surly again. The items he had taken from our house were missing from the painting. Aeronwy was were she belonged as well, a triumphant smile on her lips.
  

  
I took both paintings down from the walls, and hung them facing each other in the short hallway between the garage and the downstairs bathroom. One of the architectural oddities of our house, it ended in a closet so tiny as to be nearly useless. No one would have to look at them there.
  

  
I gave Aeronwy a last salute, then went back upstairs. I kissed each of my sleeping children, then snuggled into bed next to my husband. This weekend, maybe we would go to a local art gallery and look for new pictures to hang in the upstairs hallway.
