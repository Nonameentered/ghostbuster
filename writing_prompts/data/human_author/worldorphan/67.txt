**Dream of a Shining Forest**
  

  
Sometimes a dream can be a door. Most times, a dream is just in your head, but sometimes, your soul travels across the silver in-between spaces and your feet touch down on the sandy earth of one of the Dream Worlds. You can tell the difference by the taste of silver on your tongue and the shimmer in the corner of your eye. But truthfully, if I have to describe it to you, then you've never done it.
  

  
I lay down on my tatami mat to sleep, and found myself in a Dream of a bamboo forest much like the one surrounding my village. It was dark, with only a sliver of a moon in the sky, but the tiny red lights of the forest spirits danced in the trees. I walked along a path. In the Dream Worlds, you control your own actions. Your surroundings, and everything you encounter, are created by the denizens of the Dream. They have no true shapes of their own, but pull images from a traveler's mind and mold themselves to match.
  

  
All at once, the night sounds of the forest fell silent. The spirit-lights went out. I froze, listening. Behind me, something moved. I started walking again, more quickly now. Maybe it was nothing. Maybe it wouldn't follow me. But then I heard it again. And again. I looked back. Something was definitely there, but I couldn't make it out between the trees. I didn't want to find out what it was. I had to get away. I ran. "Wake up!" I told myself. "Wake up!" I stumbled into a shimmer in the ground and felt myself falling. I awoke with a gasp.
  
I went to see Fuong. She was a village elder, wise and magical. She'd taught me everything I knew about dream traveling.
  

  
“For the past week,” I told her, “every time I sleep, I dream of something chasing me. What do I do?”
  

  
“Tam, my girl, whatever you do, you mustn't let it catch you. Some dream-things, especially nightmares, are not content to stay in the Dream Worlds. It can use your Dream as a way into our world, where it can do harm.”
  

  
“I can't run forever.”
  

  
“No. Fears are meant to be faced, child.”
  

  
“How?” She didn't know.
  

  
At first, I tried to stay awake as long as possible. I spent most of the night zoning in and out. Just before dawn, I admitted defeat, and slept.
  

  
For a moment, I was surrounded by the ubiquitous mist of the Dream World. Then it coalesced into  a big, fine building with rice-paper paneled walls. As I wove the narrow hallways, I heard footsteps behind me. Futilely, I hoped that if I didn't run, if I showed no fear, the dream-thing would get bored and leave. There wasn't any evidence that this was the sort of nightmare that followed dreamers back to their worlds. If it was, what would it do, I worried. Float about like a ghost? Possess people? Attack people? I broke out in cold sweat. It rolled down the back of my neck. The thing was getting closer. I could hear its ragged breathing. 
  

  
Involuntarily, I quickened my pace. I turned a corner and caught a glimpse of it, man-shaped and pale. It was so close. I couldn't help it. I started running. 
  

  
Ahead of me I saw a door. I hoped it would be the shimmering portal out of the Dream, but it was just an ordinary door. It led outside onto a path of white stones. I wondered if I would be safer on the path or off it. I chose the path. It brought me to the bamboo forest. The red spirit-lights were still absent. The trees passed by me in a blur. Suddenly, the path was gone, and I was weaving aimlessly between bamboo stalks that got closer and closer together until I could no longer squeeze through.
  

  
With no other choice, I turned around and finally saw what had been chasing me. He was the man in gauze, the bandaged man. I had seen him begging in the marketplace when I was a child, and I had been so frightened of him. Mother told me he'd been badly burned by a curse of his own making, and condemned to suffer. 
  

  
But mother was stern, self-righteous, and slow to forgive. Fuong always said, “It is the duty of the young to be better than their elders.” 
  

  
So I chose to show him compassion. I pulled a silver coin from under my tongue, where I knew it would be in that impossible way of dreams, and offered it to him. He took it. For a moment, his bandages fell away, leaving behind a shining spirit. 
  

  
Then all dissolved into mist, and I woke up.
