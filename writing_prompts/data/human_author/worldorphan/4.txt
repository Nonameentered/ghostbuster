Hi! I like to write stories in a setting I call the Hall of Doors Universe. It is based on the premise that there are thousands of worlds, including our own Round Earth. Most of them are smaller than ours, only as large as a single country. They are connected by portals or thin places, of which there are several types: door-shaped, ring-shaped, and path-shaped. Door and ring portals usually take some knowhow to open, or else need a key. Path-shaped thin places are much rarer, but can be activated by anyone who walks down them, and these are the basis of many of Round Earth's fairy tales. 

In the beginning, there was only one world. It was plagued by terrible wars between magical creatures (and a few human allies) and humans without magic. And possibly inflamed or even perpetuated by a mysterious third group working towards their own evil goals. To end the war, a group of powerful wizards and magical creatures got together and worked a spell that would split the world into two: a magical world, and a magicless world. But something went wrong, and instead of dividing into two worlds, it shattered into thousands.

The worlds are also connected by the Hall of Doors, which is pretty much what it sounds like. It has a caretaker who is a servant of The Fates, an enigmatic old man who likes tarot cards, who watches literally everything that happens in all the worlds, but has almost no free will of his own. He lives there with his adopted six year old grandson Toby (who never ages since the Hall exists outside of time) and sometimes a perpetually sixteen-year-old world-walking half-faerie named Ellie. Ellie and the Keeper of the Hall of Doors were both there when the original world shattered.

I have written lots of stories in this setting. I have written a novel, which I am currently (mostly procrastinating from) editing. I've also finished one serial on the r/shortstories Serial Sunday, and I'm most of the way through a second. I've also written a number of short stories here. I've got a handful of recurring characters that belong to this setting, and I love bringing them into stories.

I think the main reason I created a setting like this is that I love crossovers and recurring characters. It's like unexpectedly running into old friends. I feel like my characters always want to jump into each other's stories, so I made a setting where that was possible. I also love creating different worlds, rather than being bound to the rules and lore of a single one. And portal fantasy has been my favorite genre since I read The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe when I was six.
