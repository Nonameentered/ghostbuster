1. What got you started in writing fiction?

I guess it was my parents reading to me so often when I was little. They really fostered by love of stories. I can't really remember a time when I wasn't making up stories. They just kind of live and grow inside my head. I started writing them down when I was in third grade. I had a notebook full of the beginnings of stories that I never finished. Also really bad poetry. In middle school, I wrote a whole novel. It was 30 pages long, and probably terrible. But I finished it. I eventually lost it because it was on a hard disk that got corrupted. (Dating myself, y'all!)

>2. What book or short story do you wish you wrote?

You mean what real book do I wish was mine? Um . . . *The Ten Thousand Doors of January* by Alix E Harrow. It's a portal fantasy with a plucky girl protagonist, and the prose is absolutely gorgeous. Reading it actually made me really jealous of the author's skills!

>3. Please describe your writing in terms of a dinner main course.

Maybe my writing is like Asian stir-fry. Sometimes I just start picking ingredients and putting them in the pan without much planning. But I know what stir-fry ought to be like, and how to keep it balanced but interesting.  Sometimes I put too many different ingredients in, and it gets too complicated or I make too much, but usually it turns out pretty good in the end. And it's healthy, with plenty of vegetables. By which I mean that I try to keep my writing wholesome and upbeat, with a positive ending. I wish it could be like Thai stir-fry, with the perfect combo of sweet and spicy flavors, and just the right amount of complexity. That's something to work towards, I guess.    :)
