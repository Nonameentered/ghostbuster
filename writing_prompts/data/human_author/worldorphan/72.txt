**14 Days**

June 21, 2021

I never keep journals, but I need something to pass the time. I'm stuck in the house for 14 days. Chad has COVID. His desk is next to mine, and we've spent a lot of time together at the bar. Germaphobe boss ordered me to quarantine. I feel fine. Pat and Mike don't have to quarantine. I knew I should have gotten vaccinated when they did.

I've suddenly realized how little time I spend in this house. I'm always out, working, at the bar with the guys, at the golf course. I bought this house six months ago, and it still doesn't feel like home.

I'm so bored. Even work seems appealing. But there's not much I can do from home.

Random note: I found a hole in my bedroom wall. A tiny one, like where a nail was removed. I wonder how I never saw it before.

Still no COVID symptoms. I texted Chad today to see how he was doing. He's pretty miserable. I should feel bad for him, but all I can think about is how it's his fault I'm stuck at home.

I found three more holes in my walls. A second one in the bedroom, one in the bathroom, and one in the kitchen. I thought I saw something like a large worm crawling into the one in the kitchen. But by the time I got close, nothing was there. I probably imagined it.

The silence in this house is unnerving. I've started leaving the TV on just for noise. In bed last night, I kept hearing something moving inside the walls. I wonder if my house has rats. Or cockroaches? Or could it be those worms I thought I saw? No, all this time alone with my own thoughts is filling me with paranoia. It's just ordinary vermin. When I finish my quarantine, I'll call an exterminator.

I keep finding more holes in the walls. There are at least a dozen. And I saw the worms again, for sure. One slithered out of one hole and into another. It was pink and mucous-y and at least a foot long. I took a photo and sent it to Mike. He didn't believe me. Said he couldn't see it. How is that possible?

I did some research on my house. It turns out a previous owner went missing, twenty years ago. What if someone killed her and hid her body in the walls? And the worms are breeding in her corpse?

July 1

It's 3 a.m. I just woke up with a worm crawling over my face, trying to crawl up my nose. How many others have gotten inside me while I slept? That can't have happened, can it? I can't let fear put crazy ideas in my head.

&#x200B;

July 2

I've been sick to my stomach all day. I can feel the worms moving around in my guts. Made an appointment with Dr. Landry, but he wouldn't see me in his office. We had one of those video visits instead. I told him about the worms. He didn't believe me. Said to call him back if it didn't clear up in a few days. Pompous jerk.

&#x200B;

July 3

Still sick. I keep finding more holes in the walls. Worms sliding in and out. I flushed some. Half an hour later, they were swimming around in the toilet bowl. I crushed one under my shoe. It split into three pieces, and each piece crawled away. How do I kill these things?

&#x200B;

July 4

I can feel them inside me. They're multiplying. Their movement, it's becoming more intense. I can feel them sliding between my organs, up and down my arms and legs. I can't reach Dr. Landry because of the holiday. I should go to the ER, but what if they don't believe me?
