Hmmm... Perhaps a society pays a heavy toll for its continued misuse of those who serve. Is it the fault of the attendant for mis-judging the customer or the customer for participating in a system that exploits low-wage workers? What would it look like if accountability in both directions were built into our culture so that there was a penalty for unkindness? Would it truly curb unkindness or expand it, feeding the victim narrative of those already cold-hearted, having suffered a crisis of meaning in an increasingly meaningless world? Is the solution to the abuse of service workers so technical? Or is it adaptive?

No one is innocent when we are all equipped with hatred.
