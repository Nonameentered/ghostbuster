The Mercedes was much quicker and nimbler than his antique junker. Despite his sizeable lead, I caught up quickly, weaving around traffic, dodging pedestrians and stopped vehicles alike. I needed to cut him off, pin him somewhere tight where he couldn't escape me again. 

We approached an intersection clogged with stopped vehicles, and I slowed to block him from behind. He stopped and I did as well. The rusted door of his car flew open and he sprinted across traffic in the adjacent lane, a choir of blaring horns expressing their frustrations. 

I opened my door before thinking better of abandoning my car. Missing class was one thing; getting the Mercedes out of impound was another. I pulled out my phone and sent a message to the group chat: 

*Artist found, 34th and University. Abandoned car after chase.* 

Doctor replied*, "Identifying marks?"* 

*"Hoodie jacket, running shoes, blue jeans. No beard-must have shaved--sunglasses and beanie hat.*"

*"I'll put out an APB*," Detective answered. 

I placed my phone back in my pocket and passed the abandoned Carolla as the light turned green. I could still make class, though the tea would need to wait until next period. 

\------------------------------------------------

My car couldn't keep up with the Mercedes' speed. Why couldn't Doctor have been using it today? I wouldn't be anywhere near the hospital.

My tires squealed and shrieked as I maneuvered the hunk of scrap around traffic, narrowly missing joggers and parked cars on the street. Professor would try to pin me in, trap me somewhere I couldn't escape. But would he leave the Mercedes behind? I didn't think so. He intended to wreck me. 

I slammed on my brakes as I approached a line of stopped cars at a red light. Professor slowed and pulled behind me, the Mercedes emblem growing larger in my rearview mirror.  

I leapt from the stolen car and ran across traffic, hoping to either make it across the street or die instantly. Car horns blared in my ears, motorists shouted from their windows as they careened to a halt. 

As I reached the opposite sidewalk, I turned around to see Professor watching me, pursed, angry lips coldly returning my stare. He pulled a cell phone from his pocket and began to text. I knew exactly who he was messaging. The others. 

I continued to run, grateful that at least one of us found time for daily exercise. But I couldn't run far enough on my legs alone. I still needed to get into the University; I still needed to get my papers. Then, I needed to steal another car and escape. 

But first I needed to change my appearance. Detective will be putting out an APB if he hasn't already, and if I was still dressed in these clothes, it was only a matter of time before I was snatched up and brought to the station.
