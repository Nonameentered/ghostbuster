My hands have crafted stars, dimensions, planes of existence beyond the capacity of mortal minds. In the depths of my exile, I have pondered the great questions of life, only to find my conclusions empty. An existence without purpose; life made only to be extinguished. If this universe--this sadistic illusion of choice and circumstance--were truly meaningless, then I shall become meaning. I shall become the extinguisher of souls, the vanquisher of idle life lived only to die. I would put an end to the stars and all those spirits that rely on their light. And I would begin here, in this damned planet. I would rise to the surface, and begin my wrath with that careless, arrogant race of bipeds: the humans. 

But first, a sandwich. 

When considering the weight of all reality upon one's shoulders, nourishment is critical, but nourishment pursued without convenience considered is a fool's errand. Flavor is also important. That's why I choose [Pepperidge Farm Honey White Bread](https://www.pepperidgefarm.com/product/farmhouse-honey-white-bread/), a product rich in flavor, but light and fluffy enough to compliment the flavors of whatever sandwich meat you choose. A special thanks to Pepperidge Farm for sponsoring today's blog post. 

The rugged contours of even the most satisfying bread can become like the barren cliffs of the spaces between dimensions, souls crying out in a state neither alive nor dead, subject to all malice and contempt in a perpetual state of suffering. Feeling all things at once, hopeless, and destined to continue their misery for all time until the Great Beyonder deems the very fabric of the cosmos unworthy of its light. For this reason, I always opt for a good mayonnaise. I usually prefer my own--crafted from the eyes of the unfortunate seekers of glory in the depths of my keep--but for today, I'm satisfied with the gold standard: [Hellman's Real Mayonnaise](https://www.hellmanns.com/us/en/products/mayonnaise/real-mayonnaise.html). A staple for every happy home. 

Now to the meat of the sandwich. Literally! I will be using [Boar's Head Maple Glazed Honey Coat Ham](https://boarshead.com/products/ham/150-maple-glazed-honey-coat-ham) generously, with two to three thick slices (feel free to increase or decrease based on your dietary and taste preferences). When my tentacles wrap around a Boar's Head ham, my thousand otherworldly echoes of psychic voice vibrations cannot help but to scream in a discordant chorus: wow! That's quality!

No ham sandwich is complete without a good cheese. So I searched for the right cheese in the right place. That's right, [Wisconsin Cheese Company's signature Gouda](https://www.wisconsincheese.com/find-cheese/ch/26/gouda). Creamy and versatile, this product lights up even the darkest realms of space and time, where mass is condensed into nothingness, that nothingness itself become destruction: a creation subverted, bent inside out, driven only by chaos and hatred.  Feel free to flambe the cheese before closing up the sandwich. It is the power of flame that binds all things, cleans all things, reduces all back to dust. And it will provide a delightful consistency to this afternoon treat. 

Finally, no good sandwich is complete without that *special something.* Stonewall Kitchens makes a delightful-yet-dangerously-delicious [cranberry habanero jelly](https://www.stonewallkitchen.com/hot-pepper-cranberry-jelly-101203.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjw54iXBhCXARIsADWpsG-g6HZEwqdVb4FbFXt-I5-aM9nE2CVA70r1setWYhk0G7XBmxsVqucaAs0uEALw_wcB). The flavors of sweet and spicy mingling might be an odd pairing for some, but believe you me when I tell you that never in the vast history of the multiverse have two entities coalesced so completely. In the incalculable odds of a meaningless, chaotic void of space and time and stacked planes of reality, for something so *complete* to be present fills my spirit with dread of what else may slumber in the darkest reaches of the great beyond. Adding this flavor profile to your ham sandwich will remind you of Christmas dinner!

And there you have it! Feel free to adjust this recipe, turn it into a melt, or light hors d'oeuvres to serve guests. You cannot go wrong with this recipe. Enjoy it while you can! Because when I emerge from innermost heart of this pale blue planet, I shall do so with the rage of a thousand suns, scorching and pillaging, crushing and devouring, becoming that which brings meaning to the universe through the pain and suffering of human lives.
