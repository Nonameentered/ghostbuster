The Speedrunner barreled down the street in reverse, piloting a recently-commandeered car, narrowly missing motorists as they swerved out of his way.

The vehicle sparked and crunched as it struck a railroad crossing and flew wildly in the air. The Speedrunner ejected from his airborne automobile and brandished a rocket launcher, which he aimed toward the ground. The blast from its muzzle threw his body across the sky like a ragdoll, limbs flailing, body rotating in limp cartwheels.

There was a loud SPLAT as he collided with the side of a building. The rocket launcher dropped to the sidewalk, followed by his mangled, wet corpse.

I stepped over it and uttered an exhausted sigh. It was the same thing today as it was yesterday and the thousands of days before that. The Speedrunner shows up, finds some new, inventive way to navigate through the city, before meeting a grizzly death, usually involving vehicles, firearms, or, in rare cases, law enforcement.

"What do you think, Charlie?" Dale, a delivery driver asked, as he unloaded the back of his truck the same way he'd done every day since time began.

"Not his best work," I shrugged.

We both looked back at the pile of ruined flesh twisted on the sidewalk. "Do you think it hurts?" Dale asked.

"Not enough not to try again tomorrow."

"Ill tell you, someone ought to talk that boy straight," Dale grunted as he pulled his dolly over the street curb.

"He doesn't talk. Doesn't even seem to register other people except to steal their cars," I explained.

"Yeah, I know. More of a turn of phrase, I suppose. Don't let me tie you up now, we both got work to do."

As I walked away, Dale's words resonated with me. I never felt tied up by talking with the city's inhabitants. But I wondered what it would take to tie up the Speedrunner, demand his attention.

The next day, I waited in my car, parked on the city's main thoroughfare, waiting for the Speedrunner to show up. In the back seat were lengths of rope and chains, a taser, and duct tape. My plan was half-baked, sure, but the small diversion from the motonony was exhilarating.

Soon, an ice cream truck squealed as it turned the corner, narrowly tipping over. The Speedrunner was on top, riding the giant fake ice cream cone like a rodeo bull while an armada of police cars followed behind.

I pulled my car into the street, cutting him off and I retrieved the taser from the back seat. His head poked out from the giant strawberry ice cream scoop and scowled.

"Get down here!" I shouted to him, waving my weapon.

His dismounted the mobile dessert station and sprinted for my car. I jumped in the passenger seat as he reached the driver's side. I was panicking, shaking. I didn't want to be a pancake on the sidewalk.

With one hand, the Speedrunner pushed against my face, trying to force me out of the car. His eyes were fixed forwards with a dead stare, his expression blank and unconcerned.

My taser bit him in the armpit and his body shook as it stiffened. Finally he was unconscious. I tied him up with the ropes and drove him to my apartment.

When he came to, he was tied to my dining room chair. After a brief bout of struggle, his blank face turned to meet mine.

"I have questions," I told him.

His face did not seem to register my words.

"Can you hear me? Do you understand me?"

His mouth opened and the words "untie me," came out in a disconcerting, robotic tone.

I inched backwards until I was against my kitchen counter. "N-not until you answer my questions."

"Ask," he said plainly.

"What are you doing here? Why are you running around the city? Why is every day exactly the same as yesterday?"

"Seeking exploit," he answered cryptically.

"What does that mean?"

His eyes, half closed and deathly casual, stared into my face. "You are not real. I can kill you anytime, everyday, forever."

I gulped hard, now feeling vulnerable sharing space with this suicidal sociopath. "What exploit are you looking for?" I ignored his threat.

"Passageway between worlds. Where the walls of this world touch the walls of another. Essentially."

"What other world?"

"What is your name?" He asked me.

"Charlie," I answered quickly before thinking on it long enough.

"See you tomorrow, Charlie."

The ropes fell away as his body disappeared. What have I gotten myself into?
