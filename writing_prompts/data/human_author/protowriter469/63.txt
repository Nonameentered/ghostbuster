I took a desperate breath and opened my eyes wide to the bright noon sun. Sharp pain radiated through my body; the odd sensation of bones and joints moving into place, jagged edges grinding and crunching as they reassembled on their own accord. Where was I? What had happened? 

The land around me was hazy with dust and pluming smoke. I risked turning my head slightly to take in my surroundings: some kind of large hole in the ground, myself at the center. My spine popped like a rock-em-sock-em robot as my head moved. 

"You okay?" A voice called out through the veil of air born dust.

I opened my mouth to speak, but only a groan emerged, weak and tinged with whine. 

A murmur grew at the edges of the hole, silhouettes of bodies turning to each other, leaning forward for a closer look. 

"Is anyone a doctor?" Another voice called out to the group. 

My back arched as my vertebrae seemed to force themselves back into order. I felt every rearrangement of my organs and bones as they worked independently into formation. Finally, my breathing had become normal, my neck able to pivot smoothly--my hands and fingers opened and closed without agony. 

There was a noise against the hole's wall as someone clumsily descended down toward me. She was wearing a jean jacket, her hair black hair put up in a bun. 

"Oh," she gasped as she approached. Her face was painted with confusions and, perhaps, apprehension? Something about me laying in the middle of this hole--naked, I now realized--had subverted her expectations. 

"Sorry," I yelped as I rushed to cover myself with my hands. 

Her mouth frowned, as if to say *that's not what's weird*, as she shrugged off her jacket and handed it to me. I draped the small, denim garment over my lap and shot her back a rueful smile. 

With her hands on her hips, she surveyed the sky above us and the whole around us. "Where did you come from?" She finally asked. Her accent was speckled with hints of foreign inflections--her practiced, professional English betrayed her more interesting roots. 

"I... I don't know," I confessed. 

Her brows furrowed as she crouched down next to me. "You shouldn't be sitting up or moving your neck. You might be--probably are--concussed." She gently guided my body back down to the ground. 

"I feel fine."

"You're probably in shock," she observed, her words only partly a reply to mine. 

More footsteps descended the hole's walls. An overalled man with a bushy red handlebar moustache and a lanky, long-haired teenager made their way to us. 

"He dead?" The moustache asked without reverence. 

"No," the woman with the bun and I responded in unison. 

"He hurt?" 

I replied "No," she replied "Yes." 

Confusion washed over the newcomer's faces. "Well. Is he hurt or ain't he?" 

"He's likely in shock from the fall," the woman with the bun explained. Her tone was firm--she was the authority here. "I'm calling an ambulance."

"No need," the scrawny boy drawled. "We can put him in the back of my pickup." His thumb shot over his shoulder toward some vehicle beyond the dust. 

"Absolutely not." Her voice was raised, but not higher. She was adept in taking charge; arguing with difficult men. "He needs his neck stabilized..."

The pair had already ceased paying her explanation attention. "Ambulances are expensive," the moustache announced. "A truck ride would be free."

"A truck ride would kill him!" The woman stomped her foot as she moved between me and the men.   

The three began arguing, the woman to save my life, the men to save my credit score. 

I stood up, the jean jacket wrapped around my front, the sleeves doing nothing to conceal my rear. "I'm fine, really," I spoke, interrupting their heated debate. 

The three turned and looked me up and down, eyes wide.

"Well there you have it," the moustache nodded, the backs of his hands pressed into his hips. "False alarm."

The woman hesitated as she approached me. Her eyes took in the unblemished state of my body. "Are you...are you alright?" 

"I think so," I nodded. 

"Who are you?" 

My mouth opened to answer, but words didn't come out. It was like I had forgotten a word, my brain rushing to reach it at the tip of my tongue. "Oh. I'm, uh..." It felt absurd to not know this very basic question. Was I panicking? Like a middle schooler called on for the first time?

The three eyes me differently now, their expressions less concern for me and more concern for my trustworthiness. 

"I'm so sorry," I laughed sympathetically, "I should know this." 

"How'd you get here?" The scrawny man asked. 

Once again, I was without words. I simply didn't know how I wound up inside this hole. 

"Ma'am," I shifted to the woman. "I think I might've hit my head."

She let our an involuntary guffaw. "I would say that's a safe assumption." Her face lifted to the sky and back down to the hole. "You must have fallen from thousands of feet."

*Fallen*? 

"I've heard of people falling from the sky," the moustache chimed in. "Failed parachutes, bungee cords, that sort of thing. It's like, uh, weight distribution that saves them. Like, if they fall flat, they don't die."

"Sure, as long as every bone in their body absorbs the impact. No one comes out unscathed," the woman sniffed sardonically.

The dust had cleared and a crowd was gathered around the hole. They were whispering, conversing about the naked man before them. 

"How did I get in this hole?" I asked the three. 

"You mean this *crater*?" The moustache corrected me. "You made it when you fell!"
