She turned into the alleyway, gasping for breath as she dashed over months of accumulated refuse: bags of trash, old appliances, boxes upon boxes toppled in crooked piles. Behind her, they snarled and screeched, their razor-sharp claws scraping against the concrete. 

She turned another corner, and another. The backways of this town were like a labyrinth, twisting in odd ways, paths blocked by abandoned cars and half-collapsed buildings. In front of her, a tall chain-link fence rose roughly ten feet high, crowned with barbed wire. The time it would take to climb it, much less carefully move around the razors protecting the other side, would give her pursuers ample opportunity to catch up. 

She looked side to side searching for some alternative. A rusty fire escape hanged down from a burnt out building. It was up high, but a dumpster sat beneath it. She could jump off the dumpster, perhaps bounce off the wall, and reach the hanging ladder. Hopefully the black brick fa√ßade still had enough structural integrity to hold it. 

She jumped onto the dumpster's top, took three preparatory huffs , and--

She felt the impact like a freight train. It was on her, its snarling, wet, hairy body pinning her on a rancid bag of trash. Its jaws snapped around her face, its breath heavy and eager. Where there was one, more were to follow. That was a certainty. 

With a free hand, she retrieved a hatchet from her belt. Its blade was sharp--she had honed it this morning before setting out. It didn't require a big swing to do serious damage. 

With her right hand, she began chopping at the beast's belly. It whined and recoiled, warm blood spurting from its wound. She could see in its once-human eyes the terror of a mortal wound; the realization of one's fleeting life. She wondered if there was still a human in there somewhere, a mere witness to the chaos they were causing. 

For a moment she thought about apologizing, but what would be the point? For one thing, the creature would soon be dead. For another, she wasn't sorry.

She heaved the hatchet in the air and brought it down on the monster's skull. There was a solid crack as the blade hit the bone and red blood splashed outward all over her clothes. 

This was a problem. In an age without power, without washing machines and laundry soap, hygiene was important. Her first priority was escaping before the monsters' pack caught up. Her second priority was to take a shower and find new clothes. 

She readied herself to jump on the dumpster again, but as she sprang upwards, a stabbing pain radiated from her ankle. *Oh no*, she hissed as she grabbed her leg. This was bad. She couldn't run on this, much less jump around. 

Echoes of galloping claws bounced off the building's walls. She readied both her hatchet and the machete from her belt. If she was going to survive--and that was a big if--she would need to be downright surgical with how she dispatched her attackers. 

They rounded the corner, three of them, their jaws hanging open, bouncing with their wild, awkward gait. Their eyes glowed with that red light and their giant claws stomped over the broken cars and crates in their way. 

She closed one eye and aimed down her hatchet's blade. She only gets one shot at this, and it needs to be perfect. With a fluid swing, she launched the hatchet through the air, its spin whistling as it flew. 

It impacted into one of the monsters' shoulders, but it showed no sign of slowing. *Shit*. Now it was just her and the machete. 

*Pop pop pop*.

She dropped at the loud noise. The monsters let loose a brief whine before collapsing mere inches from her. One of their mouths opened as their dying jaw spasmed and its tongue rolled out and touched her hand. Pools of blood collected on the ground, covering every inch of exposed concrete. 

"Hey!" A voice shouted from above her. A human voice. She peered up and saw a man with a rifle in his hands. "Why are you wearing crocs?" 

"What?" She must have misheard the question. 

"Your shoes," he pointed. "They're crocs.?"

"Yes," she confirmed, her answer half question itself. 

"Why?" 

"I'm out here alone, covered in blood, and you want to know about my crocs?" 

"Yeah."

She steadied herself upright, making sure she kept the weight off her bad ankle. She steadied herself by holding the fence beside her. "they breathe really well." 

"They look dumb."   

"I'm not really, uh...thinking about fashion these days." 

"I can tell." 

They stared at each other silently for a few moments. 

"I'm going to throw you a ladder," he announced. "And then I'm taking you shopping."
