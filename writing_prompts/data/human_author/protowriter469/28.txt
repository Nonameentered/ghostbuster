The hostage was bound and gagged in the back of the prisoner transport. Two armored escorts rode in the front, each armed to the gills with various accoutrements of killing. 

With each turn, each slow stop and acceleration, the hostage took note. He knew the city like the back of his hand, after all, despite having spent less than a full weekend there. He was *gifted,* some liked to say. Maybe that's the right word. In his mind, however, he liked to think of it as *motivated.*

A paperclip fell from his sleeve and into the palm of his hand. He straightened the aluminum wire and pressed it into his cuffs, depressing the pins and snapping open the restraints.

The hostage removed his blindfold and gag and felt the floor. There should be three consecutive bumps now, since they had just entered a school zone.

*bump*

He pressed the edge of the handcuffs into the door's gap.

*bump*

He applied leverage, careful not to snap the restraint before he could manually unhatch the door.

*bump*

The door nearly threw open, slamming against the sides of the van and alerting the guard, but he caught it in time.

Now it was a waiting game, the tables turning slowly on his captor. He would come out on top, catch them with their pants down.

The brakes of the van squealed as it slowed to halt. They were... By some kind of church, the hostage thought.

One guard, with a shotgun strapped across his chest, threw the door open to see the hostage standing tall before him.

"What the..."

Behind the first guard was the second, his pistol raised... To the back of the first guard's head.

"I think a change of staffing is in order," the former hostage announced.

The guard with the pistol pulled his trigger.

*click*

The chamber was empty. 

Without looking, the first guard turned his shotgun around and fired, knocking his parter into two pieces across the churchyard.

"I don't know, Simon," the guard answered, returning his gun to his front. "I think I might make employee of the month."

Simon looked wide eyed at his co-conspirator, now a pair of bloody lumps. A statue of the virgin Mary seemed to gaze down on his torso.

The guard took off his helmet. It was *her.*

"No... I... No, I watched you die! I killed you!" Simon's voice was shrill, his eyes becoming red with rage.

"What can I say? A minor in performing arts plus 14 years Special Operations training..." She shrugged. "I can make anyone believe anything."

Simon's legs shook, and he slumped down into the cold metal seat where he'd been placed less than an hour before.

She stepped up and sat across from him.

"You played us like a fiddle..." his voice was as wispy as was paper. He was defeated. Small.

She laughed wickedly. "Oh please. Fiddles are actually hard to play. I  played you like the kazoos you are."

If he heard her, it didn't seem to register. She loaded two shells into her gun.

"Any last words?"

"Tell my--"

*Boom*
