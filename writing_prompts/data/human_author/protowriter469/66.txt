He stood up in the kitchen, wiping away sweat from his forehead. 

"Welp, I got good noose and bad noose sir."

"What's the bad news?" I sighed.

"It's what I was afraid of, foor sure. Somebody's cursed ya." 

"Cursed me?" 

"Cursed ya." He adjusted his pants, which had been hanging off his hips while carrying the load of his prominent paunch. 

"What does that mean?" 

"Da water coming from tha pipe ain't *your* water. It's ocean water. Salty, ya know. Someone conjured a gate from your pipes to an ocean." He shrugged. "People ain't civil no more." 

"Uh huh." I bit squinted at the plumber as I bit on my knuckle. 

"But, oh lord, it coulda been so much worse." 

"Worse how?"

"Welp, they coulda connected it to your sewer line. Or a major sewer line. Or, like, da bottom of da ocean. Your pipe's woulda exploded foor sure." 

"I see. Can you fix it?" 

"Dat's da good noose! I double majored at the community college in arcane sorcery and plumbing. I just happen to know how ta dispel gates. You sit tight and I'll be right back." 

The plumber moseyed awkwardly out the front door and started digging around in his van. 

I texted my wife. "I think we need a new plumber."
