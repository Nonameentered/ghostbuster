Curating a kill is the most critical step of my method, more so than the kill itself. I wouldn't kill just anyone; few are worthy of the privilege. When I select my target, I choose one with Spirit worth eating, someone whose skills and memories I desire. A street urchin toting a decrepit grocery cart of mildewed laundry has nothing I want. I kill geniuses and kings; CEOs and young prodigies. And after my knife glides across their unsuspecting necks, I grow wiser, stronger, better.

I was perched atop a dark apartment building in the bad side of town, a far cry from my usual surroundings. This hunt required no tuxedo nor stealthy black suit. Only a pair of binoculars and time.

What was he doing out here? Didn't he have some luxury loft someplace with a doorman and an alarm system? It shouldn't be this easy. I peered through the oculars and watched him pace feverishly in a sparcely furnished flat. He seemed nervous; jittery. It wasn't good to kill a person when they're already in a state of heightened awareness, but with the lack of precautions he'd taken thus far, the reward grossly outweighed the risk.

I descended the building's fire escape and strolled across the street, my hands tucked into my jacket pockets and my face obscured by a ball cap. I punched the door code into the cypher lock and it opened for me. He had entered a few hours before and made no effort to hide it from wandering eyes.

I ascended the staircase quietly but swiftly, wrapping my fingers around the knife in anticipation. The door's numbers were off-center, arranged oddly on the front.

"406"

I knocked and there was a shrill man's voice inside.

"Who is it?"

"It's your neighbor from downstairs," I lied, "I've got water leaking through my ceiling."

I heard a murmuring, like he was talking to himself, followed by several thuds and the rummaging of glass and heavy objects. Finally, the door opened.

In less than a second, my knife went in and out of his neck. I closed the door and descended the stairs quickly. In a few short minutes, his Spirit would flock to me and I would eat his memories, equipping me with the full knowledge of his employer's headquarters, vault, and security system.

I rounded the block and jumped in my car. The turned and roared to life and I was off I to the night, a phantom.

It wasn't long before I felt that familiar sensation, the Spirit washing over me, warming my bones, filling my lungs with air.

I searched my mind for information. But I saw strange, odd images: black caves, dead bodies, fire. I saw impossible landscapes and smelled sulfer in the air. Then I had a vision of the apartment door shutting behind him, the oddly placed 9 swinging downward into a 6.

I killed the wrong person?

It was laughable. Pedestrian. I looked into the rear view mirror to see if there were any lights headed the apartment's direction, but I was greeted by a pair of bright, yellow eyes from something sitting in the backseat.
