8PM and all was quiet on deck. 

I served myself another helping of bitter, burnt coffee. In two weeks I’d be boarding a transport back home. Then it was only seven months in space before this deployment was done. But who’s counting, right? 

It’s not that Mars was a bad assignment. It was a privilege. I’d studied geology for a decade just for the chance to be here, to study the red planet’s mysterious nature, to chart its history, to advance mankind into an interplanetary race. But on Earth they have fresh, non-freeze-dried coffee. So it’s a draw. 

May was my second on deck that night. A recent PhD grad in astrophysics from the Rochester Institute of Technology, she was anxious about our two-week countdown for opposite reasons. She didn’t have family to return to, earthling hobbies to indulge, vacations on the horizon. She would get home and “write and publish my research between missions.” She made for a reliable second, but not a particularly interesting one. 

I cracked open a paperback to pass the time since non-astrophysical conversations were out of the question with May, who was diligently cycling through the station’s telescope feeds at her station. Where was I? Oh, right. The kingdom had been sieges by the barbarian hordes to their west, who had tricked the adventurous prince into a false truce. Would the prince return home from his quest in time to fight the hordes, or would the kingdom be left to his beautiful-yet-ambitious sister, the p—

There was s shriek, short and sudden. 

I looked over to May, whose hands were slapped over her mouth. She turned to look at me, wide-eyed and watering.

“What?” This was a new expression for her: not stoic and studious but frightened. Horrified. “May, what’s going on?”

She scooted back from her desk, revealing her monitor. It was a display of Earth. It looked normal to me. 

I pulled my reading glasses off and leaned in closer. “What do you see?”

Wordlessly, she rewound the footage and zoomed in on the United States. On the Eastern seaboard. 

There was a bright flash, a perfect circle for only a moment. And then there was smoke. The resolution was only so reliable on these telescopes, which were by no means state of the art. Nevertheless, she zoomed in further. The display showed a fuzzy burning city where Washington D.C. used to be. 

“It’s got to be dirt on the lens. Right? There’s got to be something to explain this that isn’t…” I couldn’t finish the thought. I didn’t want to name it. 

May went to the center console of the station deck and radio’d our sister station. 

“Valles, this is Hebes Chasma Station. Over.” Her voice was almost steady, almost collected, except for a slight quiver in her throat. It was that ghost of panic from the otherwise constant calm that made my hands begin to shake. 

“Hebes Chasma, Valles. Over.” 

“Valles, Hebes Chasma, can you take a look at the Eastern Seaboard, around Washington D.C., and tell me what you see.” 

“Standby.”

We waited in the quiet white noise of vents pumping air and computers humming. In my mind I was repeating the phrase *please be nothing, please be nothing.* I looked over to May to see if she might be thinking the same, but I couldn’t read her face. 

“Hebes Chasma, Valles. Uh…it looks like some kind of explosion? I’m not really sure…. OH SHIT!” 

My heart sank with their first words, confirming our fears. But their shouting at the end thrust me up from my seats. Behind the transmitter’s voice was the sounds of several voices cursing in fear, like spectators at a sporting event watching a player get knocked out in an ugly way. 

May rushed to the telescope display and we watched little white blips pop over the continental United States. Faintly, on the other side of the world, we watched smoke plume into the sky. The US wasn’t the only country getting hit. 

The quiet was deafening. How much death, how many screams, what suffering were we witnessing from 77 million miles away? 

We woke up the station commander and support staff, and they called an emergency meeting. We were to abandon Hebes Chasma and run our Quick Reaction Checklists for evacuation and relocation to Valles. We needed to broker peace with the other Martian stations from what had become, in an instant, our wartime enemies. 

That was 20 years ago. 

Today we are preparing for our first Martian Summit, with Commander May Yung, my old partner, as Sovereign ruler of all Martian territory.
