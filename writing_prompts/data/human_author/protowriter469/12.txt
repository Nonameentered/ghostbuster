I walked along the sidewalk with my hands in my coat pocket, trying my best to keep them warm, but failing. It was a colder night than I'd expected--fall came early this year. My head was down; eyes on the sidewalk, counting the squares to take my mind off the cold.

I nearly ran into the small crowd standing just outside the club smoking their cigarettes. 

"Oh, sorry," I blurted, my shoes scuffing on the concrete as I pivoted away. 

"No, don't be sorry." The voice was deep and gentle, like velvety chocolate for the ears. I looked up. It was one of *those.* 

He stood nine feet tall and wore long, white hair that poured over his back and touched his pair of perfectly white feathered wings. His pale blue eyes looked me up and down, sizing me up like I was a delectable snack making his mouth water. 

"Where are you off to in such a hurry?" The angel moved closer, releasing the pair of woman who'd been pressed up against his body beneath each of his long arms. 

"Home," I said curtly, averting my eyes from his. I didn't want to be caught up with these...things. Everyone seemed to trust them--to *love* them--but I've never trusted, nor loved, so easily. And these supposed "soldiers of God," have been suspect in my mind since they landed six months ago. 

"Home? Alone? When there's so much love to be had right here?" His hand rested on my shoulder, his palm so large that his thumb found its place on my sternum. He didn't squeeze or push, but I felt the power in those hands. If he wanted to, he could crush my right now, like a grape between his fingers. 

I laughed nervously. "Thanks, but, uh... I've had a long day. I really just want to get some sleep." 

His laugh countered mine with confidence. "Sleep? Let the dead sleep. Come *live.*" He leaned down and breathed on my face with a cold, sweet whisper. It felt as if the world was zooming out. I was no longer cold, no longer uncomfortable. I was suddenly *melting*, like I'd drunk hot chocolate after a frigid winter day. 

I was becoming...Well....A giggle escaped my lips.

No. I slapped my hands over my mouth and looked away from him, holding my breath so he couldn't entice me further. Is this how they did it? Is this how they drew in so many followers so quickly? 

"I'm not interested," I told him flatly, squinting my eyes shut and turning around against his grip. 

"Oh," he cooed with mischief. "And yet, you're so *interesting*." The girls behind him giggled. They were now looking at me with the same excited longing as the angel. 

I tore myself away from them and walked quickly down the street. 

"I'll see you later...Danny." The angel called from behind me, to the cackling laughter of his human posse. How did he know my name? What was his? Should I turn around? See what there is to see? Give my body to him? Give my mind to him? Surrender my soul to h--

I slapped myself in the face. No! Snap out of it!

The world seemed to trust these creatures, who fell from the sky with happy tidings and promising freedom and ecstasy for the faithful. *The era of human suffering was over*. And the world bought in, hook, line, and sinker. 

But I knew they weren't really angels. They twisted this place into a den of decadence and debauchery. 

But I will stop them, I will find the true angels.
