Day 40: I think I'm almost used to small-town living. If you'd have told me a year ago I'd be in a tiny little village in Nebraska working in a mom-and-pop-owned caf√©, I would've laughed in your face. 

But here I am, post-big leap of artistic faith, working a parttime job, writing a new book, and living in an old, decrepit, affordable house. Inspiration comes from outside, and we should makes ourselves uncomfortable from time to time, I've read. 

I talked to Angelica (fake name, of course) a little bit last night. Sharing a kitchen means you run into your roommates from time to time. And, not to be rude, but I don't think I would've picked Angelica as a roommate. But the place was affordable ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

She was telling me that the house was built in 1891 and had several major renovations over the years "but the bones are the same." She smokes inside. I don't love it, but at least she sits by the window when she does. 

Old houses are strange. I guess it used to be that houses that weren't specifically made to be mansions were build narrowly to save resources or something. So all the staircases are thin, the stairs themselves are steep, and the floorboards *creak* like crazy. 

But damn. $300/month. Can't beat that.

Day 41: Something weird happened today and I'm sitting outside to collect myself a little bit. Maybe there's a gas leak in the house? Or asbestos in the walls? Does asbestos make you hallucinate? Maybe its mold. Mold is technically mushrooms, right? Or at least fungus?

I don't know. It's almost certainly in my head. 

The house has a lot of doors: long thin hallways with plaster walls and old, worn-down doors. It didn't take long before I could remember which was which. My place is the attic loft, the stairs at the end of the hallway. Coming down, the door on the right are in this order: furnace room, bathroom, linen closet. The doors on the left are these: guest room, Angelica's room, coat closet. 

With the exception of the bathroom and the closets, I haven't been in the other rooms. Angelica's room is, obviously, off limits. The guest bedroom, I assume, is also off limits, since it's locked and Angelica told me when I moved in that "It's a mess in there, just a bunch of old stuff." 

When I came home today, Angelica opened her door as I was walking past. The sudden noise spooked me and I caught a glimpse of the inside. 

There was nothing in it. And it was **big.** Like, auditorium big. And tall. She shut it quickly when she caught me looking. 

Angelica keeps her windows blocked with sheets of newspaper, so no one can see inside. But, like, I've walked around the house several times. It doesn't make sense. The room looked taller and wider than the house... it should be going right through my room!

It's probably nothing. 

Gas leak.

Day 42: Today was my day off, and I needed to know if I was crazy or not. Angelica left for her job at Dollar General around eight, puffing a cigarette like a freight train as she walked out the door. I sipped coffee and made sure her '98 Toyota Corolla drove off before I started investigating. 

I'm not proud to say that I set out to break into Angelica's room. But I needed to know if this house was built before the laws of physics were passed. 

I tried her doorknob first, but, of course, it was locked. Angelica is a very private person and spends little time outside her room when she's home.  It makes sense she keeps the place locked up. 

Then I started looking through drawers and inside closets trying to find some spare keys. I checked on bookshelves and cabinets, sifted through pots and pans and old vases. 

Nothing. 

She must be paranoid about something. Maybe a snooping roommate? I guess I can't really blame her. 

It'd been an hour at that point and I was getting frustrated. Why? Why is this bothering me so much? Why can't I just let go of this obvious trick of the eyes? 

As I crossed the door again heading back to my room, I noticed that there was a sizable gap between the floor and the bottom of the door. Had it always been there? I couldn't be sure. 

Maybe I should write poems. 

It was wide enough to slip my phone underneath and take a picture. I snapped with the volume button and pulled it out, only to see...the same low popcorn ceiling that I had in the loft. There was an old wood-grain fan and some water damage. 

It was a relief to see a normal room, but I wanted to see more. I thought that maybe I could angle my phone slightly, prop it up against the door from the other side. I reached my hand up to knuckles under the door.

Then something snatched my phone. 

I tore my hand back towards me, scratching my knuckles pretty bad in the process. I heard my camera shutter sound faintly through the door. 

"Is someone there?" I shouted, but there was no answer. 

I needed my phone back. How was I going to explain this to Angelica? 

When she got home around 6, I waiting in the living room on her couch. 

"Hey Angie," I greeted apologetically. "I dropped my phone and it skidded into your room." I didn't feel good about lying, but it felt a lot better than the truth.

"How?" Her face crinkled with disbelief. 

I followed her to the hallway and we looked at the bottom of the door. It was flush with the floor. 

"I don't understand...there was a gap." 

"The foundations," she waved her hands in the air, explaining the mystery. "They shift or something. I don't know. It's an old house. I'll get your phone." She pushed a key into the doorknob and waited for me to step back so I wouldn't see inside. The door opened outward, blocking the hallway and my line of sight. 

As soon as she stepped in, the floorboards under her feet stopped creaking. Was she just standing there on the other side of the door? Was she moving at all? Come to think of it, I can never remember hearing footsteps from her room. 

Maybe she refinished her floors or put down some super-plush carpet. 

Had the door always swung out? 

Finally it opened again. I wished I'd repositioned myself to the other side to get a look in, but my mind wasn't there. 

"Here you go." She handed me my phone. "Try to be more careful," she warned me as she stuck a cigarette into her mouth.
