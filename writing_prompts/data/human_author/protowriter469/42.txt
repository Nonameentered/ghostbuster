If Hitler never came to power, Europe would have entered a period of unprecedented innovation in both art and science. This rennaisance of thought would have produced an explosion of inspiration and competition across the globe. Instead of a Cold War, there would have been an *Idea* War, where countries would fund medicine, space exploration, gene editing, and so much more. The world would never have developed nuclear weapons, and the sobering prospect of global warfare would never have been imagined. 

It sounds like an optimistic piece of historical fiction. "What about Stalin?" you may ask. "What about Hirohito? Nixon? The English, generally?"

I'm glad to say that in this reality--that is, a split-off timeline adjacent to our original timeline--the evildoers are sabotaged before they can rise. The systems of oppression are revealed before thay can gain power. Evil is squashed while good is given every leg up.

It's not historical fiction. It's my job.

I'm a time traveler.

The only time traveler.

Well, I guess, I *thought* I was the only time traveler. Or, more accurately, I *used* to be the only time traveler.

I fill my cup with a ladle of punch, the foamy residue of melted ice cream still frothy on the top. I sip the super-sweet concoction and roam the event room floor.

"How did you convince the ninja king to abandon Shinto?" I overhear one man ask a young-looking woman in a top hat.

"Did you ever have to assassinate anyone?" an elderly man mumbles through his mustache as he swirls a flute of champagne.

I felt out of place. The invention of time travel--*MY* invention of time travel--had some unforseen effects on the fabric of reality. As humans progressed quicker, time travel was discovered more easily. A time traveler in my timeline created another timeline and fixed more distant problems. Then, in their timeline, time travel was founded even quicker, and *that* time traveler solved even more problems.

We find ourselves now at 368 distinct timelines. At 241, a time traveler figured out how to travel backwards to a previous timeline and forwards again. The technology was shared among all time travelers and now, in my timeline, we gather annually in some stuffy hotel to mingle and smugly brag about our various exploits.

A woman took the stage, dressed in a sequin gown, cargo vest, and a pair of basketball sneakers. Fashion, we've all come to learn, is an intensely delicate phenomenon. If a butterfly flaps its wings on one side of the world, a lady gets bangs on the other. Or something.

"Good afternoon, my fellow chrononauts," the woman announced with raised arms and an unsettlingly wide smile. "and welcome to out fourth annual time gathering!"

There was a smattering of applause and the tinking of glasses and dishes as cups were refilled and caterers replaced empty food trays.

"My name is Thuk n' al-Gutierrez-Block, and I will be hosting this year's Recognition of Time Greatness!"

The applause rose into a modest crescendo. Each and every one of these people was a narcissist, excited only by their own accolades, motivated only by being better than the last one. And for what? *I* invented time travel. Me!

"Excuse me?" a voice called from behind me. I turned around to see top hat girl standing there with a mixed drink in her hand.

"Are you Foster Coy? The first one?"

Finally, some recognition. I smiled wide and gave a playful bow. "That I am."

"I'm Tantastra Vin-Carcoll, number 368," she thrust a hand toward me.

"Ah, our most junior initiate. Welcome."  I shook her hand, only for her to pull me close.

"We have a big problem with the machine," she whispered. "And it can only be fixed in the *original* timeline."
