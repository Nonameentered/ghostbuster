I'm going to die from some heart condition one day. I rubbed at my chest, the heat rising and aching in my ribs, sending pangs of ache into my throat and clenched jaw. 

"We can't afford to be careless with what the *read* and what they *hear*!" The childless woman screeched across the room, swinging her arms over the lectern, particles of spit catching in the air where rays of sunlight shone in. I wondered how much of that would make its way to me and my chest burned hotter. 

"We are raising *Americans*, not commies!" Her words were accompanied by a smattering of applause in the meeting hall. 

Inevitably, there would be another sterile adult standing up after her, railing against censorship. Then another one, shouting against pornography. Then another, about her tax dollars. 

I smiled a fake grin, nodding my head to their fury. Of the thousand people in this community, three are children, and their lives are a public matter of debate. And I'm the scapegoat for the adults' dissatisfaction. 

The meeting wound down with nothing resolved, just like every Tuesday night. I gathered my coat and my briefcase and made my way out of the hall, towards home. On nights like these, when tempers ran high and neighbors satiated their boredom through petty fights, I opted to take the long way back, along the perimeter wall.

"Evening, Governor!" Called a voice above me. Frank was an elderly man, somewhere in his 70s, guarding the wall on his night shift. 

"How are ya, Frank?" I returned the greeting. 

"Fair to middling," he nodded. "Yourself?" 

"Tuesday," I shrugged. He chuckled, immediately registering what that meant. 

"Tough one then?" 

"No tougher than the others, but tough all the same. I don't know how much more I can take."

"I hear you. Fear does weird things to people," he told me. "But you know that. You were in Iraq, weren't you?" 

"I'd gladly return rather than deal with all of this," I half-joked. "You know--and you don't have to tell anyone this, Frank--but there are days I wished that comet would've just hit us rather than zapping through the atmosphere." 

Frank listened with a nodding frown. "Have you taken any time off, Governor?" 

I snorted with laughter. "And go where?" I slapped the wall. "Five square miles and nowhere to hide." 

Frank turned over the wall. "I wouldn't tell anyone if you took a stroll. You're not a kid, so the bandits wouldn't want anything to do with you." 

I weighed the option. "Maybe sometime, Frank. But I think tonight I just need to sleep."

"We;;, Governor, the offer's on the table whenever you're ready. You have a good night now!" 

"You too, Frank." 

I decided to stop at the middle school on the way to the house. I checked in with the guards at the doors and stored my gun in a locker just outside the next checkpoint. Billy McDermott, a gas-station-clerk-turned-armed-security-guard escorted me to the nursery. 

Dina was reading to the children in the faint glow of an oil lantern. I spotted Jay's head of black hair, his face turned upward at the storybook and Dina's expressive eyes. I wanted more than anything to walk in, sit with him, hold him in my arms. This was not the childhood I'd imagined for him.

"You good, Governor?" Billy whispered to me. 

I nodded, lying.
