"You don't look like how I imagined you'd look," was the first thing I said after she introduced herself.

"The woman part or the black part?"

"Well, both I guess. But you were played by Morgan Freeman once, so the black part isn't that big of a deal."

"Me being a woman is a big deal?"

"I guess? I don't think anyone down there knows you're a woman. Well, no, that's not right. Ariana Grande has a song about that I think. But..."

"You're probably wondering why I called you up here," she interrupted me.

"I assumed I died."

"No, you didn't."

"Huh. Then what am I doing here?"

She leaned forward in her chair, her face sharp, stern. "You've been blaming me for quite a lot lately. I wanted to give you the opportunity to get it off your chest."

"Oh. Well then, in that case..."

"But I have thing I need to get off my chest as well. I figured you could do one, then I'd do one."

"Okay."

"Okay," she sat back and gestured for me to get started. 

"I guess, firstly, I need to know *why* you let atrocities happen to people. You sit idly by while innocent people--children, even--are killed. You could stop it. That makes you culpable!" 

She nodded as I spoke. "I could stop it, you're right. But that wouldn't be fair to you. Human beings are made wonderfully in my image, hardwired toward empathy and thirsting for justice. Your lives' purpose is to build my kingdom on earth as it is in heaven--to bring comfort to the afflicted, justice to the marginalized, freedom to the prisoner--not for me to coddle you and protect you from all danger. I need you to take responsibility and *grow."* She sighed and cast her eyes downward. "But my heart does hurt with each catastrophe. The end, however, is not the end. All my children return to me in paradise; into a bliss so complete that they forget pain entirely."

I hadn't heard it explained like that before, and I was left with more questions than answers. Before I could begin asking them, she started speaking again. 

"I've pulled up your internet browsing history, and I have many questions..."

"Never mind! I'm ready to go back!"
