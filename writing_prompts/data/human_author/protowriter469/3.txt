Too many people died trying to drive their sedans through the sand. Ever since the dust starting blowing, and ever since we realized it wasn't gonna stop blowing, only tank treads will get anyone from point A to point B safely. The government--what's left of it at least--even went so far as to outlaw traditional wheeled vehicles. How they planned to enforce that ordinance was a mystery to just about everyone. 

A ghost of a man, his skin all wax and cheekbones sharp on his face, was passing through. I waved to him from my porch as I cradled my rifle on my lap. These days one has to balance neighborliness and safety in equal measure. 

The man's eyes looked me over, something ticking in his diminished mind. 

They said at the beginning of all this that human beings were a resilient bunch, always working out solutions to the problems they made. But of course, those were speeches by people for whom things *did* always work out, because their daddies were rich and their legacy college was guaranteed. The rest of us trusted them, of course, because that's what scared people do when disaster approaches: they trust what they want to be true. I wondered if this gentleman, in his converted Toyota Camry with tank treads, was one of those believers, preparing for the end of the world al too late. 

He turned his car around after he passed, bobbing up and down over the small dunes collecting where the street used to be. He slowed and stopped in front of my house and rolled down the passenger window. 

"Water?" He called to me weakly. 

Ain't that the question? *Water?* And nobody has an answer.

I shook my head at him and adjusted my leg so he could see the gun I was holding. 

"You don't look so bad," he observed. "You look kind of fat, actually."

"Thank you for the compliment, sir, but you'd better be on your way now." 

He squinted out over the horizon, the abandoned, toppled houses and barren trees dotting the dead landscape. "I'll die if you don't help me. Could you live with that?"

I could, but I said nothing. 

"I just need some water to get me to the next town. Just something to wet my mouth," he kept explaining. "Just a little, and I'll be gone." 

"I've got no water, friend. I'm sorry." 

He didn't move. He just stared at me with those manic, sunken eyes. How much disappointment had he been company to over the past few years, I wondered. Do people ever become immune to rejection? To inhospitality? 

He cursed at me, his eyes glistening with the little moisture he had left, and he drove off into the sand, but a plume of dust in a few minutes. 

I waited for a while to make sure he wasn't turning around, and I went inside for a shower. The heat had been making my skin all sticky.
