Rain gently dripped along the café windows. The indoor fireplace was comfortable against the cold wet outside, and the hot coffee warmed the humans' bones. Tarafael had ensured that the atmosphere was perfect: the music wasn't too loud, the heat wasn't too hot, the coffee wasn't too strong, and so on and so forth. 

Cliff was sitting at a table along, sipping from a warm mug, his countenance a puzzled wrinkle as he tried to recall what exactly brought him here. For many recently-deceased, memory does funny things like this: it confuses us, troubles us. That's why it's important to build these sets, so that they can transition easier. 

But this wasn't just any holy place of transition. This was an opportunity for Cliff to meet Jane. 

She walked in to the shop wearing her crocheted hat and eclectic collection coats. Cliff looked to see the woman, toting a patch-saturated bag and huge gages in her ears. His face shifted, Tarafael noticed, from confusion to interest. 

The first spark is so important, like a chemical connection that begins a tidal wave. 

Jane walked to the counter and ordered a large--*I'm sorry, I meant Venti*\--caramel Frappuccino with an extra shot of caffeine and plenty of whip. Cliff looked down at his plain, boring cup of black liquid and suddenly felt inadequate.

She sat at a table across the café and pulled out a pad of paper and an intimidating collection of pens, pencils, and highlighters. Tarafael smiled and looked from the woman to the man, witnessing his fascination grow. 

The barista brought Jane her coffee and she looked up to thank her, catching Cliff's stare in the process. He quickly averted his eyes, looking off into the window, as if he were intensely studying the weather. She smiled as she looked back down at her art. 

Then they just sat. 

*This will not do*, Tarafael thought. She snapped her fingers, and a leg under Cliff's chair collapsed, sending him and his coffee spilling to the floor. Jane looked up with shock at the embarrassed, fallen man. When she noticed there was no one behind the counter to assist, she stood up to help. 

Cliff could feel the heat radiating off his face. His shirt was sopping and the brown stain would probably never come out. He was glad the café was nearly empty, but he would've rather fallen in front of a studio audience than in front of...what was the name she gave the barista? Jane? 

"Up we go!" Jane announced as she appeared over him. She offered out her hand and he sheepishly took it in his. "I've got napkins," she showed him.

"Oh, thank you," he mumbled, too nervous to make eye contact. 

"Hold still, let me help." Jane patted his front with the white napkins as he stood, awkwardly, being touched by a stranger. "This is going to stain. I'd sue," she joked. 

"It's not that big of a deal. I have a Tide pen at home." 

"You're going to need a Tide fill tool," she remarked. 

"I'm sorry?" 

"Art joke, never mind." 

She looked him up and down and shrugged. "Well, no sense frisking you further. Looks like the deed is done." 

"I appreciate your help!" He smiled. 

"You got it...dude," now it was her turn for awkwardness. But the difference between Cliff and Jane was that Jane reveled in awkward, strange, and funny situations. She gave him a playful punch on the shoulder. "Not sure why I said that," she admitted. 

The silence between them became uncomfortable. 

Tarafael scratched at her chin, wondering what to do now. Unsure, she decided to continue breaking things. 

Cliff's mug broke off at the handle, sending the cup plummeting and shattering to the floor. He stood there, surprised, holing only the ceramic "C" of the dish. 

Jane laughed at the absurdity. "Today is not your day!" 

"Doesn't seem to be, no." Normally, Cliff might have been angry, embarrassed at the string of unfortunate coincidences, but something about Jane's laugh made him want to laugh as well. 

"Can I have that?" Jane pointed to the amputated handle. 

"The handle?" 

"Yeah. I could use it."

He held it to his chest. "But it's all I have left." 

They both laughed together. Jane, still smiling, bit her lip with curiosity over this tall, dark gentleman. "Do you maybe want to sit with me? You know, just in case a chandelier falls, I can bat it away." 

"That's a good call, but don't think you can swoon my handle away from me." 

"I guess we'll see," he bright smile widened. 

Tarafael's heart melted at the soulmates' meeting. Where life had kept them apart by time and distance, this middle state gave them the opportunity for their spirits to mingle, so that they can go into the afterlife whole.
