A hissing noise woke me up. I opened my eyes to see a pane of foggy glass was only a few inches from my face--too opaque to see what was on the other side.

I tried to bring up my HUD, determine where I was, what I'd been doing. For some reason, my organic memory couldn't recall even the most recent events. I knew Pure human biology was flawed, but I guess I'd forgotten just *how* flawed it could be.

The HUD didn't come up. I continues to try, blinking hard as the air hissed all around me. Nothing.

Odd.

The glass shifted in front of me and lifted. Cold air rushed in, sending a chill all over my form. Where was my temperature regulator? Where was my heat reservoir? I wrapped my arms around myself, trying to retain as much heat as possible.

I stepped out from my enclosure--some kind of pod, I realized--and into the ruins of what must have been some sort of ship. Huge cracks ran through the ceilings and floors; moss and dripping water had found their way through them.

I stepped carefully, the pads of my feet sensitive as they touched the cold floor. I needed to prioritize my next actions logically, create a plan and execute it. I blinked hard for my HUD. It was still missing.

Okay, well then I'd need to do it the old fashioned way. I've been old fashioned before, haven't I? For my first hundred years I'd lived without augmentation. I could make it through this.

A shiver of uncertainty--and cold--ran up my spine. I'd need... What? A pen? Paper? Like some kind of caveman? Fine. Maybe there's an office on this ship somewhere.

I shuffled to a doorway on the left, which led to a dark hallway. Beams of sunlight entered the space through holes in the ceiling. If this wasn't such a dire situation, I'd almost want to paint the scene. It seemed somehow tragically beautiful, a statement on the futility of human ambitio--

"Ow!" I yelped as my foot came down on something sharp. I'd relied for so long on warning sensors that I hadn't been watching where I was walking.

I leaned against a wall and looked at the wound. Red blood seeped from the pad of my foot; a sharp curl of metal flooring stuck up in my path, it's tip now red.

The pain was unbearable. There was no automatic painkiller administration in my body, it seemed. Or, at least, it wasn't working properly. How did anyone ever live like this? How do people *still* choose to live like this.

I felt like some kind of Amish hillbilly in my Pure body. I hated it.

I continued along, now limping and whining like a battered dog.

Where are my augments? How could someone take them? Where was *I*, for that matter?

I tried to distract myself by listing the things I did know: I'm 626 years old. My name is Enoch Mazer. I've been married 18 times. I had... 21 children? But they were adults now, doing their own things. My last occupation was... Oh jeez what was the last thing I was doing? I was first an artist. Then a teacher. Writer. Journalist. Teacher again. Graphic designer. Painter. Bookkeeper. Accountant. Business owner. Teacher for third time. Counselor. Spiritual director. More writing. More teaching....

Was I still a teacher? That didn't feel right. But the silver lining was that my biological memory stores weren't as shabby as I'd assumed earlier.

Was I married?

Let's see, first there was Danielle. Stephanie. Marcy. Cameron. Estelle. Joanna. Stephen. Marcus. Brittany. Elise. Franklin. Veronica. Rebecca. Vince. Charlie. Natalie. Spivey. And, finally, Jodie.

Another kind of chill ran through my body. *Jodie.* She was why I'd sworn off marriage. As if committing one's life to someone 18 times was evidence enough that it was an irrelevant institution. But, hey. Taxes.

There was an open door in the hallway that led to what appeared to be crew quarters. There were beds, mirrors, drawers--it looked like any post-apocalyptic space-age bedroom. Mold had climbed the walls from where water had gathered at the floorboards.

I tentatively opened the storage compartments and nearly shouted with relief to find clothes. I changed into... Whatever this fashion was: a silky, silver shirt, black pants, and silver boots. I'd had to wrap another sock around my bleeding foot before sticking it in the boot, and I took a spare pair of socks with me just in case.

Now I was feeling warmer, modest, and more confident. I moved quicker through the ship, finding rooms inaccessible due to their collapsed ceilings and doors that wouldn't budge.

At the very end of the hallway was a closed door with a red light at its center. I put my hand on it and it chirped and turned green.

"Good morning, Enoch," the pleasant voice greeted me.

That was a development. I'm not sure what kind of development, but a development nonetheless.

The door slid open, revealing a large, pristine captain's deck. Lights flickered on and consoles powered up.

"Good, you're awake." This voice was deeper. Familiar.

"Hello?" I searched the room for the man speaking to me.

"Hello," he responded. That's when I recognized the voice. It was *mine*.

"What is this?" I asked.

"This is... You," it replied. "Crashed and ruined, having accomplished only one thing over these many years."

"Me?" I asked.

"Ah. Your memory banks are damaged. You don't remember your convergence." It observed. "Look around you, Enoch. This is your body, the glorious, space-faring hull that has carried you across the cosmos."

That didn't register on my ears. "I'm sorry, can we back up? Who are you? Why do you sound like me?"

"Why, Enoch. I *am* you."
