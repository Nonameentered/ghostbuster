I was walking down the street, peering at my phone, cycling through the rage-inducing headlines interspersed by a funny joke or picture of an animal.

"Oh! Excuse me!" He exclaimed.

"Oh, no, excuse *me*," I politely lifted my hands in surrender. "Haha."

"Haha," he returned.

I backed up away from the strikingly handsome man and nearly collided with another. "Ope!" I exclaimed. "Excuse me!"

"No, excuse *me*," he surrendered. "Haha."

I moseyed down the sidewalk, my skin prickly with the embarrassment of having nearly made contact with another person. I passed a man sitting on the ground, leaned against a building and holding a sign.

"If you have some extra money, please consider donating to me. You don't have to, of course, and please don't feel pressured in any way. I'm really just looking for enough to get a decent meal. But that's not your fault. Honestly, from a cultural standpoint, it's not mine either. Just a thing that happened. So, if you're feeling generous--and again, no pressure--maybe consider donating. Or not."

To fit the letters on the torn cardboard, he had to write each one very small. One by one, handsome (notably so, in fact) men passed him, reaching into their pockets and shrugging before moving on.

I reached into my pocket to search for coins I knew weren't there. "Sorry man," I told him.

"It's no problem. Have a great day!"

"You have a great day as well!"

"Haha."

"Haha."

I walked to the nearest caf√© but it seemed like all of them were packed with downright beautiful men, so I hailed a cab. As soon as my hand went up, five pulled over immediately.

"Morning!" the closest cabby called. I waved off the rest and they waved back at me. *Don't worry about it! It's nothing!*

I stepped inside and closed the door behind me. "Any good breweries in town?" I asked my driver.

"Do you like IPAs?"

"Do I!?"

"I know just the place."

"Thanks!"

"It's no problem!"

The ride was quiet for a little while before he looked at me through the rearview mirror. "So, what's your favorite color?"

"Burnt orange," I told him.

His eyes went wide in the reflection. "Really? Mine too!"

"No way!"

"Way!"

"Haha."

"Haha."
