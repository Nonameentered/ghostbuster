"Ope. Careful there, you almost fell." I was holding the kid up after he nearly took a spill over the wet tile floor.

"Blimey," he gasped, Britishly, "I owe you a thousand thanks for that, mate."

"Sure. Don't mention it."

"I was in a rush. The Passage of Time-Stoppening waits for no one!"

"Great, see you around." I didn't have time for this. It was always the same, week after week, some self-important main-character-type trouncing around the campus violating the vague and cryptic student handbook rules, looking for a sidekick.

Being a ginger in a magic high school is hard.

I could feel the kid's disappointment as I walked off. Had he been waiting for someone to walk down this hall? Is he that desperate?

"You two! Stop right there!" A haggard voice called through the hallway.

"They're after the Stroimius Key!" The kid produced an emerald key from his pocket, his face flashing with fear and excitement.

"Who is?"

"Professor Ursine! The Director of the Department of Strange Creatures!"

"The bear guy?"

"A bear? Of course, it all makes sense now! The honey. The claw marks."

"It's... Dude, his name... How do you not-- no, I'm not talking to you. I'm not getting roped into this. *You* go find your destiny or whatever. I have to get to class."

"We'll have to use the Pow-Powder. It packs a punch!"

"I'm walking away. I can't hear you."

As I walked quicker, hands over ears, eyes fixed to the ground.

I nearly ran into the delegation of school staff standing like a wall before me.

"What have we here?" The dean, Doctor Leo Luminus stood at the center, his grey, short-cropped beard framing his wisened, wizardly face.

"The kid over there is stealing stuff. Professor Ursine is chasing him. I'm trying to get to class." The teachers followed my finger to an empty space.

"I see nothing," Doctor Luminus squinted at me with suspicion.

"Welp. He's either gone or using invisibility potion. I don't know. I don't care. My parents don't pay my tuition for me to care about that stuff."

"Perfect distraction!" The boy's voice called from *behind* the group of teachers. He shrugged off his invisibility shroud and threw the Pow-Powder on the floor.

The teachers went flying straight into Professor Ursine as he rounded the corner.

"You two will be expelled!" Doctor Luminus shook his fist in the air. "Once we catch you!"

"Looks like this is our exit, chum!" The kid threw portal discs to the floor.

I sighed deeply. "Tell me your family's rich or something, left some mysterious treasure or whatever."

"My dad's a Congressman."

"I charge $300 a day."

"$200, and you get a romantic interest."

"Fine." I walked into the disc and we disappeared.
