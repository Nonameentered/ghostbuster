My paddle boat rocked in the murky waves, cold with the unseasonably chilly summer and grey overcast skies. Hell of a time for boating, I realized. But I needed this, rain or shine. At the lake, there's quiet at least. There's space for my thoughts and my voice alone. 

I took off my shoes and socks and dipped my feet in the water, hoping the the lake would carry its cool to my head. The boat was just large enough for me to lean back with my legs off the side, so I did so and I draped a towel over my face. I was going for total disassociation. 

But the voices only grew louder the more I deprived my senses. 

*You idiot! You little bitch!*

I squeezed at my temples; I tried the book's exercises. *When you think of something, say the word "thought" out loud.*

Thought thought thought thought thought thought thought th--

Something bumped against my toe and I nearly jolted myself out of the bolt. As I sat upright, pulling my knees into my chest, the towel fell onto my lap. A water bottle bobbed in the waves.

I snorted my dissatisfaction. Is nothing sacred anymore? What hillbilly redneck piece of trash person is throwing plastic water bottles in the lake? 

I fished it out and threw the weathered plastic onto the boat's floor. I'd need to remember not to leave it in here or *he* would throw a fit. 

He throws a fit about everything. 

*You ungrateful little punk!*

I wished the lake flowed into a river that would take me the 2,000 miles to the ocean. From there I would sail across the world in my little paddleboat. To like, Spain, or something. 

I probably wouldn't make it that far. But when they found my body, when they confronted him, maybe *then* he would--

There was a rattle in the boat, an unmistakable tapping that didn't belong to any other noise on the lake. I first thought about rattlesnakes, but, of course, rattlesnakes don't live in water. Right? They're desert lizards. Are snakes lizards? 

The rattling shook again, louder this time. I followed the noise down the boat's floor, to find the water bottle spinning in place, a fog swirling inside. When I pulled it from the water, I assumed the cloudy plastic was from wear, but I could see now that there was something trapped inside. Was there a small animal in there? Was its breath fogging the container?

Hesitantly, I reached for the bottle and unscrewed the thin, plastic top. As I did so, I thought it might've been better to wait until I was back ashore. A small, panicked animal might bolt right into the water, where it would drown. 

But my body and my mind were working independently. I was mesmerized by the cloud inside the bottle, its smoke swirling, glinting with glittering specks and purple haze. I found myself, for the first time today, *not* thinking about anything. 

The cap came off, and the fog escaped, growing, shrouding the boat and the water around me in a dense fog. The air was sweet in my nose and on my tongue and cold--much colder than the water--against my skin. 

I froze in place, still swaying with the tide, though the water seemed to calm as the cloud grew.

A face emerged from the wall of fog before me, towering and terrifying, its eyes glowing with purple and pink brightness. 

"Thanks," she spoke with a thundering breath.
