As a bird leaves its mother's nest, so too do the yound of the village grow into adults, destined to brave the dangers and opportunities of the greater world.

On every youth's 16th birthday, a ceremony is conducted. The high priestess prays before alter of the Creator, asking for the Spirit God to bless the youth with protection. If the Spirit God finds favor with the youth, a spirit companion is assigned, and together they venture forth on their Vision Journey into the unknown.

The relationship one shares with their spirit companion is among the most intimate they will ever have. In time, they grow closer than mother and child, husband or wife. Their spirits intertwine until, as the human approaches the dusk of his life, they are inseparable.

My head was bowed as the high priestess recited the verses.

"We come to you, O Spirit God, mother of us all! Before you we bring our son, our brother, Milek, who now enters adulthood and seeks your protection!"

The fires surrounding the site rose at the conclusion of every phrase, and indication that the Spirit God was listening.

"Brother Milek has lived a virtuous youth, industrious, helpful, studious. He has practiced bravery and attended your worship his entire life. Find him in your favor, Goddess. Bless him with a guide!"

My family stood behind me. I could hear my proud parents sniffling and my listless younger brother tapping his foot. The rest of the crowd included members of the village here to witness my acceptance or rejection, no doubt placing bets one way or another.

I tried to focus my mind, stop my wandering. But, unlike my parents and village elders, and just about everyone else, I had skepticism about the whole thing.

Why didn't the Spirit God reveal herself clearly? Why didn't she keep the sick well and the innocent safe? Sure, miracles happened from time to time, like the dancing torches, but that only proves her existence, not her goodness.

"Stand, Brother Milek, be blessed by your Goddess!" the chief priestess told me as she lifted me up by the arm.

A wind rattled the altar, sending the flames i to a trembling dance. People from the crowd gasped as their hats dlew away and their robes were lifted.

When the breeze died down, the torches were out, faint smoke wafting from their tops.

There was a groan amidst the crowd. Some of it was disappointment, some secondhand embarrassment.

"Brother Milek, the Goddess has rejected you." The priestess' touch was sympathetic and soft. I turned toward my family but they had already begun walking away.

"Now you must embark on your Vision Journey alone, exiled until the Goddess accepts you back into her embrace." I was handed a small satchel containing a paltry supply of food and water for my potentially year-long journey.

Before I knew what was happening, I was rushed I to the forest by guards, set off into the darkened woods. Without a spirit companion to teach me survival, I would die in a few days, tops.

I walked alone through the woods, weaving between trees and stepping over bushes and tall grass. My mind was a swarm of shame and self-doubt.  I did everything right. I worked so hard all these years. Yet she abandons me all the same.

I came to a river and crouched down to drink, when in the water's reflection, I saw a woman staring back at me. I looked up and saw a light, rainbow-skinned creature with long, curly hair and a glimmering robe.

"So, Brother Milek. You want to go on a Vision Journey."

"Who are you?" I asked, panic showing clear through my voice.

"You don't recognize me?" She laughed. "You've known me your whole life."

Water was still collected in my hand and I sniffed at it, checking to see if I might've ingested poison already.

"I'm the Spirit God," she explained.

The water fell from my palms and slapped on the ground.

"And I'm going to be your spirit companion."

"Why?" I whispered in my surprise.

"Because your Vision Journey will be the most difficult there ever was. Milek, you are destined for greatness."
