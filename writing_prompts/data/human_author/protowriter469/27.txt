*Bleep blorp bleep*

The United Nations assembly sat in silence as the tiny green figures in silver suits spoke I to the microphones.

*Blip blop bleep blop blorpy*

Their words were strange... Otherworldly...

Silly.

The main speaker of the three extraterrestrial ambassadors lifted a finger. A *green* finger, thin and slender, the tip rounded.

How did we nail them so perfectly?

*Blorpus blip bloppity, blorp? Blippis blop bloppity*

They were fucking adorable is what they were. Three feet tall, big black eyes, tiny little voices. They looked like prizes at county fair stall.

The representative from Chile snuck a picture with his cell phone. He'd need to show his daughter.

Germany's delegate gazed with a pensive stare, trying to spot a puppeteer or wires somewhere behind the microphones.

The American ambassador was nonplussed, but his assistant, a young woman from New Mexico, could help but feel a little more at home.

*Blorp blip BLOP!*

The little alien pounded the podium, eliciting involuntary giggles from the crowd. This offended the tiny trio, who exited the stage, their little legs working overtime to span the distance.

An eruption of applause filled the chambers and was met with the scowls from the green-skinned aliens.

The head of the envoy pressed a device on his wrist, beaming up the extraterrestrial crowd back to the mother ship.

The chamber was vaporized moments later.
