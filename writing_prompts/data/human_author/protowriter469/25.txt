Her inverted bob seemed to spike in the back, her swoosh of hair across her forehead partially disappearing behind her oversized sunglasses, which she kept on even inside the store. She wore a fitness hoodie and tight yoga capris, which showcased ever contour of her stationary-bike-toned legs. She walked with purpose; she strode across the industrial tiled floors in her purple New Balance sneakers like a shark honing in on the scent of blood. 

But today was August 26, and she had swum into a den of barracudas, straight past the warning signs affixed to every sliding glass door. She must have missed every news story in the last month, warning shoppers of their fate, be they careless enough to enter a retail, fast food, or service industry with a shitty attitude. 

Today was Immunity Day, a labor holiday accidently passed into law as it was shuffled with routine bills and adopted by both the Senate and House, and signed into existence by the President.  It was drafted by the fringe far-left Congresswoman Maria Keawe, from Hawaii, as a political stunt to make a statement on the brutality service and tourism workers experience every day from entitled customers. 

No one, even Congresswoman Keawe herself, imagined it would pass. 

But pass it did. So, every August 26, workers in these industries are allowed to berate, curse, verbally harass, record, yell, scream, and deny service to *anyone* who makes them uncomfortable. They cannot assault or batter anyone, of course, unless they are first attacked. And they cannot stalk or invade the privacy of customers. They also cannot commit hate crimes: prejudice based on someone's race, religion, gender identity, or other protected classes. 

But shitty haircuts and Planet Fitness jackets are not protected classes, and Karen was wandering right into the danger zone on this, the day of her comeuppance. 

"Do you work here?" Her words were curt, impatient. 

I looked up from the floor, where I was stocking shoes. "What?" 

"Do. You. Work. Here?" She clapped her manicured hands between each syllable. 

I looked down at my shirt, the word "Kohl's" displayed prominently. My similarly-labelled lanyard hung across my neck, connected to a Kohl's-themed nametag with "Marci" typed on it in an equal-sized font as the name "Kohl's." My walkie-talkie chirped on my hip, a manager looking for an team member to head to household goods.

"No," I answered. 

"Seriously?" Her legs did that thing where one of them bands and the other stays straight. Her body contorted like a stiff, menopausal teapot. 

"Do you need something?" I asked her as I returned to my task.

"What do you think?" 

"Do you *really* want to know?" A smile crept up around my mouth.

"Yes, I *really* want to know, little girl." Her tone was a mockery of my voice, all nasal and whine.

"Okay." I stood up and looked at my reflection in her polarized eyeglasses. "I think you're a shallow, self-obsessed middle-aged woman running from her impending age, buying all of the merchandise she can to fill the empty hole in her heart left by children who either won't talk to her or are bleeding her dry with attorney fees to fight their DUIs. All the while, your racist, American-flag-hat toting husband of 20 years is, surprise, not emotionally available and so you're left in this desert of loneliness, despite all the people you hang around and drink margaritas with. But your friends are all the same as you, all clamoring to justify themselves, to be *better,* even if you can't imagine what better might even look like because your entire life's ethic is to be 'better' with no endgame in mind. When will you be comfortable? Never. Your marriage will always be empty. Your friendships will always be competitive and full of gossip, your children will always be disappointments. So, you've come here, to drag me down with you because you know I can't fight back. And I'll be scared but I'll need to be polite anyways, and you will have 'won,' so to speak, a victory you can report to your alcoholic Zumba class friends so they think you are *so wild* and *such a girl boss* and you *don't take no shit*. But you are shit. You are a shitty person who contributes nothing to society except the suffering and further marginalization of the working classes. You serve only as a reminder that some people in this world--me--have to work our hands to the bones to feed ourselves and others people--you--don't have to work at all. But you know what the greatest irony of all is? I am and will always be happier than you, because I derive my happiness from the good I put into the world: from watching my baby sister and volunteering at my mosque and doing a good job at my little job here. You are made of hatred, and so you will always be hateful and sad and lonely and irrelevant. You will die and no one will care. Your husband, if he's still alive, will remarry. Your kids will fight over your possessions. They'll buy an expensive gravestone and only volunteers will ever visit it. 

Because you are a bad person." 

Her posture was straight now, her hands trembling. 

"An old lady fell down in the bathroom. I haven't been able to find anyone to help," she half-whispered. 

Oh fuck.
