The women sat expectantly in the studio, their hair and makeup done by professionals and the stage lighting shining down on them. This was the calm before the storm, the moment they had each been waiting for since they'd been selected from the pool of eligible bachelorettes.

Jesse Palmer, the studly square-jawed host and former *Bachelor* star himself, walked into room, sending several of the 35 contestants' hearts aflutter.

"Good evening, ladies," he greeted in his professional, silky-smooth voice. "And thank you for joining us for this special, final season the The Bachelor."

The cameras panned around the room, sweeping over each sequined slip and breezy blouse. The contestants were smiling, their attention focused on the host. This was it. This was where they would be introduced to the man they would all be competing over. 34 women would ultimately wind up back home and single. One lucky lady would be with a man of her dreams, and true love would flourish.

"Each of you have come from all over the United States and Canada to be here, to meet our bachelor, and to try your hand at true love. Are you excited?"

The women wooed and applauded, the electric excitement sending many into a fit of nervous laughter.

"Well, let's not keep you waiting. Ladies, it's time to meet your bachelor!"

A curtain opened and fog obscured the entryway. the women wringed their hands and sat at the edge of their seats, each hoping to catch the first glimpse of this mystery man.

He stepped through the haze and into view. The clapping stopped.

The bachelor surveyed the crowd of women, a flat frown under his short moustache. Jesse Palmer approached the aquatic humanoid fascist and threw an arm around his shoulder/appendage.

"Ladies, I would like to introduce you Starfish Hitler." A slideshow played over the host's narration.

"Starfish Hitler is a lover of political science, art, music, and German-Echinodermatic Fascism. Hailing from the bottom of the ocean, he is a creature that exists at the intersections human fear and confusion, striking nightmarish fright into every warm blooded American and Starfish of David."

The slide shifted to a snapshot of Starfish Hitler holding a sports coat over his shoulder, his cold, dead eyes and disapproving scowl unchanged.

"Starfish Hitler has a special place in his seawater vascular system for the simple things life:  good food, companionship, the systematic extermination of ethnic minorities, longs walks on the ocean floor."

The slide changed again, this time to the blue-skinned mutant's frightening face offering a rose.

"Will you be the answer to Starfish Hitler's non-denominational-but-certainly-un-kosher prayers?"

Marci McDonovan from Tampa Bay, Florida was the first to be featured in a confessional clip.

"Is he my dream man? No. Is he the kind of guy my parents would have hand-picked for me? No. But there's something about his tube feet that make me think I could make this work."

Next up was Adrianne McDermott from Midlothian, Texas.

"I'm a fighter. I get what I'm after. And let me tell you, nothing turns me on like vaguely hermaphroditic Austrian white supremacists."

Third up was Audrey Goldberg from New Haven, Connecticut.

"Yeah, I have **a lot** of fucking questions."
