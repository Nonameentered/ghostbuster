The great beast's eyes glowed yellow in its barred enclosure, smoke seeping from the corners of its bound mouth. The ship chains anchored it to the ground, immobilizing its powerful limbs and enormous wings. Guards stood watch, waiting for the royal ambassador to arrive and bare witness to the creature's capture before it was executed, its bones to be carved into trophies for the hunting party that captured it.

"Open the gate!" a guard on the fort's outer perimeter called.

Every uniformed man present came to attention, their posture straight and stoic, as to be presentable to whomever the palace sent.

The great iron gates dividing the inner and outer walls rose, the chains rattling in the mechanism's gears. Three figures walked in. Two were royal guards, dressed in their ceremonial reds and blues, untarnished from the rigors of battle or wilderness. Large feathered plumes atop their helmets made them appear much taller from a distance; their shields made them look like walking, impenetrable walls.

Between them was a slender figure in a delicate gown. Rays of sun shine through the thin fabric, revealing someone young, someone beautiful.

"Who has the palace sent this time?" a guard whispered to his partner, his question equal parts scoff and genuine curiosity.

"HO-LY BALLS!" The center figure broke out into a sprint, the edges of her dress held in her clenched fists.

"Princess Lilly?" The guards snapped up even straighter, their eyes darting straight ahead.

Lilly ran to the reinforced iron bars, her hands slapping into them with enough force for the dragon itself to recoil.

"I'm going to pet it," Lilly announced with one arm already slapping at the air between herself and the murdersome beast.

"Your majesty," one of the royal chaperones fidgeted next to his princess, unsure how to handle the situation. "This is a dragon..."

"A dragon that's gon' get pet!" Lilly retorted.

The monster's eyes followed the flapping fingers of the royal inspector. Grunting, it shifted slightly forward, moving its snout the few inches forward that the princess needed.

*"Awwwwwwwww,"* the princess whines, tears welling in her eyes. "She loves me."

"She is a beast, your majesty." The gruff voice emerged from the keep's office. Captain Grimdahl marched forward, pulling his pants up around his considerable gut. "It is a menace to the realm and an abomination to nature."

The dragon purred at Lilly's touch, the thrum vibrating every chestplate and jiggling every nearby door hinge.

"An abomination?" Lilly turned to face the keep commander. "Does this look like an abomination to you?"

"er... Well, yes... I just, uh... Well, I just said that it was."

Lilly stood up and straightened the front of her dress. "There will be no dragon execution," she announced. "I will take the dragon home and feed it and water it and love it forever." A definitive nod sealed her command.

The keep's guards and the royal escorts alike looked to one another.

"Your majesty," Grimdahl laughed gently, "with all due respect, I cannot allow this beast to go loose. Especially in the proximity of his majesty's--"

"With all due respect, *captain*, I don't remember asking you a goddamn thing. Unlock the cage. I'm taking her home."
