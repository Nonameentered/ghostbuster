The numbers and their effects on the people they belonged to were never explicitly explained, but it became clear as people got used to them. 

Single digits denoted a singular element in an intense state. Very few walked around with just one number above them.

Even numbers were for earthly elements: 2 was stone, 4 was water, 6 was air, 8 was fire, and 0 was a rarity: space. 

Odd numbers were for abstract abilities: 1 was telekinesis, 3 was strength, 5 was flight, 7 was intelligence, and 9 was quickness.

A person with the number 47 over their heads would be a wise water sage. 52 would be an airborne golem. 

Numbers rarely repeated, but when they did, they tended to be uncontrollable. A 66 caused a hurricane before he was put down. A 99 lost control of herself while running around the globe and disintegrated on impact with a cliff. 

But, essentially, that's how it works: numbers over everyone's heads that point to their abilities. 

But no one had ever had an S over their heads before. 

No one until me, that is. 

After I was born, I became a curiosity, quickly whisked away from my birthparents to be monitored and studied by scientists. I was something *different.* I was something *special.*

But as time went on--as I grew up surrounded by middle-aged men in white suits--nothing happened. I exhibited no special abilities, showcased no fantastic powers. I seemed...plain. 

Over time, the disappointment in the lab grew more noticeable. The only parents I'd ever known, Dr. Edgington and Dr. Primrose, began to pay attention to me less, their hopes dashed by my failure to produce anything measurable; anything that might deepen humans' knowledge of *why the numbers are here*!

The pair made the executive decision to terminate my program as other needs required their resources. 

"I'm afraid our partnership is coming to an end, kiddo," Dr. Primrose told me through his thick black-framed glasses. "Gather your things and we'll begin your out-processing." 

"Out-processing?" It wasn't a word I'd heard before. 

He hesitated and ran a hand through his hair. "Yeah. Out-processing. You're, uh...you're done." He shrugged. 

"Where will I go?" 

"Someplace better than here." 

Primrose was a 7. Edgington was a 97. Both were brilliant, but I could never outsmart Primrose or outrun Edgington. Still, after 14 years of knowing few except them, I was able to catch the anxiety in Primrose's face; his slight sweat and disheveled frown. 

"What's really going on?" I asked him. 

He sighed. "A quick injection and you'll be transferred." 

"Transferred where?" 

"A better place," he said with finality.
