"The pill cures loneliness. That's the simplest way I can say it." My words seemed to do little to excite the boardroom. "Loneliness, uh... is an epidemic in the United States. It can lead to a lowered immune system, depression, eating disorders, heart problems..." Eyes continued to be glazed over; watches peered at; pens fiddled. "It can also decrease one's efficiency in the workplace."

That woke them up. 

"With Relinquopro, subjects showed not only heightened mood, stronger protections against disease, and a faster metabolism, but also completed assigned tasks 50% quicker, with accuracy. Additionally, they were able to work longer without fatigue and file fewer complaints."

The meeting moved quickly then, suits around the table barraging us with practical questions. *How much would this cost, per pill? How much longer can laborers work? How might this affect workers' compensation claims?* 

The meeting adjourned with the product approved for further trials, and, very soon, sale. 

I didn't even have to mention the ghosts.

Merida was confined to the apartment for a period of 30 days. She was without a phone, internet, or any means for communication beyond pieces of paper slipped under the door to request food or toiletries. A two-way cabinet ensured groceries and other supplies could be delivered without contact with the testing team. 

Merida would be utterly alone, equipped only with her wits, a small collection of DVDs, a shelf of paperbacks, some journals, and a month-long, 30mg trial of Relinquopro. 

She wrote in her diary:

"May 1, 2019

I would do worse things for $20,000. Living in an apartment alone, all meals provided, is hardly much of a test. It was basically my life without a grocery bill. 

The apartment is odd, but livable. It seems like they took a normal apartment and sectioned it off: half for observation, half for me. A suspect the large mirror in the common area is double-sided. They can see me but I can't see them. There's probably hidden cameras in the kitchen, bedroom, and \*gulp\* bathroom as well. But, I mean, there are videos of me out there already that leave nothing to the imagination. What's a show in front of scientists? For another $20k, they can sell that too." 

"May 2, 2019

The food is good. Really good. Yesterday, they served a grilled chicken breast with broccoli florets and mashed potatoes for dinner. They even included a small glass of white wine. I woke up to the smell of pancakes and coffee, then was greeted around noon to a crispy grilled cheese, loaded with smoked ham and red peppers. I wonder if they'll let me stay another month. I can get used to this." 

"May 3, 2019

Last night I woke up and someone was watching me sleep. It was probably an observer taking vitals or checking on my sleep patterns. But still, I didn't like it. 

It wasn't sleep paralysis. I could move. I just... well, he looked very strange, and I was afraid. Could he see me looking at him? It was dark, so I'm hoping not. 

When I woke up in the morning, there was an omelet waiting for me. No strange man."

Merida's diary is fairly ordinary for the next couple weeks, though she reports seeing the person roughly every three days. No observers entered the room, and camera feeds picked up no presence of any other person in the apartment. 

Curiously, during the estimated time Merida reports having seen the person, the heat signatures of the room spiked--too much to be caused by one body. 

The trial was terminated on May 28th.

"May 28, 2019

I'm watching him watching me. One of his eyes is drooped, down beside his mouth. The other is up high on his forehead. They are big, glassy eyes. His teeth are sharp. He sits hunched in the common area, a 10-foot tall figure. He keeps mumbling. I don't know what he's saying. It sometimes sounds like *kill me, kill me.* Other times it's *kindly, kindly*. His mouth doesn't seem like it was made for talking. 

He bit me. Not very hard, but enough to draw blood. He enters through the mirror and leaves that way too. It's a bridge to an adjacent ~~place~~ ~~sometime somewhere.~~ 

My blood won't stop flowing. It seemed like just a scratch, but my arm is turning green where he bit me. I can't feel it. My fingers shake and flex without me doing it. 

I've banged on the door, asking for the test to stop. They won't listen. 

They've begun putting severed feet and parts of machines in the cabinet instead of food. I haven't eaten in a while. 

I haven't slept either. 

When I tried stopping the medicine, a voice came through the wall. It was my sister. They were hurting her. I tried faking it, but they knew. 

Tomorrow, I'm going into the mirror."

Almost all of Merida's observations were hallucinations. The observation team never spoke to the subject, food was never withheld, no other presence in the room could be visually observed. 

However, on May 28, 2019, Merida successfully entered the mirror in the apartment's common area. The observation team could not locate the subject, and the glass pane showed no signs of damage. 

The medication has since been improved to reduce psychological effects.
