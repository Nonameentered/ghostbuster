The Ambassador to Earth took to the podium before the Intergalactic Council. 

"Thank you for being here, Mr. Robertson," The chief Trebulectite greeted the tall and trim representative.

"Thank you for having me," he politely replied. "Though I'm curious what prompted this subpoena."

The large, frog-like alien tapped his desk, straightening a stack of papers. "We've been reading up on your planet's history."

"Oh."

"We have some questions." 

"I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have, but please be advised that I am no professional historian, and I may need to consult one in order to offer an adequate answer."

The Trebulectite hummed his understanding. 

"The first question is this: War...Why?"

"I'm sorry...can you clarify that question?" 

The Trebulectite leaned forward into the microphone." Your species engages in war with itself. Why?"

Mr. Robertson glanced from the alien to the rest of the council, who seemed to be waiting expectantly. "Is war uncommon in the rest of the galaxy?" 

"Not between different species vying for power. But the very idea that a race of intelligent creatures might engage in war with each other... it's troubling." 

"Human beings are varied in their diversity, spanning all over the planet and practicing many different philosophies, religions, cultures... Surely your own planet has had disagreements?"

"Disagreements and war are different things, ambassador. We fail to understand how a species can hope to advance through infighting."

Mr. Robertson breathed out a pensive sigh. "Well... It wasn't long ago that we first discovered we weren't alone in the universe. There was no competition except from one another." 

"Bears!" One of the board members shouted. "The most fierce predator!" 

"If we were truly competing with bears, we would have won," explained the ambassador. "Our intelligence has afforded us a near complete domination over all other Earthling lifeforms." 

"But you don't compete with bears?" 

"Not...really..."

There was a mumbling among the panel, aliens leaning over and whispering to each other, tapping papers and flailing limbs. 

"Okay," the Trebulectite announced. "Question two: the Beach Boys." 

"The band?" 

"Yes. Surely, all of them being California girls would be foolhardy. Explain."
