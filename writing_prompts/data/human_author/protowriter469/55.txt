Her eyebrows rose in the center, sympathetically. At the same time, her eyes went wide, her lips parting ever so slightly, revealing two rows of clenched teeth. She was smiling as if enduring a song sung painfully off-key. Her hands wringed, shoulders tensed. A curtain of ice between us now, where once we were just a foot away, sipping coffee at pretentious pop-up café, I found she was on another plane of existence. Emotionally disengaged. A stranger. 

I knew the look all too well, and I regretted saying the words immediately. But no matter how familiar rejection was to me, I never figured out the right things to say in the aftermath.

"Why would you say that?" She groaned through her pained grin. 

I shook my head and looked down at my cup. Why *did* I say that? Why do I never learn? 

"I'm sorry. Ignore me. Please, let's just pretend I didn't say anything." 

"Ignore you? How can I ignore you saying something like that?" Her face changed. Serious now, lowered to my eye level, hissing like I'd just spilled the nuclear codes. "You get why that's not okay, right? Why that is incredibly inappropriate?" 

"I do, believe me. I didn't *choose* to fall in love with you. It just...happened." 

"Well, *un-happen* it. Do whatever you need to do." She looked around the room until she spotted another woman waiting in line. "Ask her out. Get whatever it is out of your system." 

"I don't want her." 

She laid her hands flat on the table. "And I don't want *you*." 

There it was, plain as day. It wasn't a bad time for her, she wasn't confused, it wasn't that she wasn't ready. It was me. It's always me, no matter how hard I try to change things. It's always me. 

"I don't want to hurt you," she sighed with exasperation. "But it's not right, and you know it would never work in the real world. Not with...everything," she gestured to herself. 

"Why not? Why can't we make it work? What's so bad about me?" 

"Well, for starters, you're suggesting this in the first place. Secondly..." She shook her head, searching the ceiling for the words. "It's strange for me to even think about. That's not what you are to me. I want someone like *me.* Let me have that." 

"Then you won't need me anymore," I murmured. 

"I *want* to *not need* you." 

"Stop!" I shouted. 

The café dissolved into pixels. The table's wooden texture dissolved into its normal off-white color. The cubicle white projection room came into focus. She was frozen, vex fixed on her face. 

"Wipe incident memory, reset environment. Let's go again."

She stood mechanically and took her position at the far end of the room. The café repopulated, and she walked through the door, smiling as she spotted me across the way. 

"Hey you!" She was all smiles now. 

I'll keep trying until I get it right.
