The shimmering ball of fire flitted inside its container, soft tings tapping against the jar's glass walls. Its radiating light cast a golden glow in my dark room, gilding the contours of my desk's cluttered surroundings. How fortunate was I to see it fall from the midnight clouds? And to find it so close to the house, nestled in a small crater of its making? Luck like this was rare. 

"Well? What do you want?" the little voice bounced around, muffled in the jar. 

"I'm sorry?" I gasped, bewildered by its speech.

"You've got me in a jar. Now what?" 

"I don't know," I admitted. 

"Well, if you could figure that out in a timely fashion, I would appreciate it!" Its shouting shook the glass container, sending a discordant vibration through the desk. 

I searched my mind for questions, explanations. "Where do you come from?" 

"Are you serious?" It sneered. "The sky. Obviously." 

"But, where in the sky?"

"BuT wHeRe iN tHe sKy?" It mocked me. "How many more of these do you have?" 

"I'm not sure. I've never met a star before." 

"Why is that *my* fault?" 

"It isn't!" I shouted back, defensively. 

"Then let me go!" 

My hand reached to the lid before I reconsidered. "Where will you go?" 

"Somewhere with more square footage, that's for sure."

"Will you return to the sky?" 

It was silent again, its frantic zig-zagging flight still. "That's my problem, not yours." 

"What's the problem?" 

It sighed with frustration. "Falling stars don't return to the sky," it explained. "I fell because...well, it's not important. Because it's not your problem."

"But maybe I can help. Maybe we can bring you back to the sky."

"A lot of stars have tried. Almost all of them have failed," it conceded. "I'm done for, and if it's alright with you, I'd like to die with some dignity." 

My heart sank at the dimming glow of its body. "*Die?*"

"Don't get all weepy on my behalf, lady," it said. "It is what it is." 

"We should at least try, shouldn't we? And besides, you said it *almost* never works. Which means it does sometimes, right?" 

"Only one star has ever returned from a fall, and I'm no June." 

"What is your name?" I asked. 

"Viivi. Yours?" 

"Lisa," I replied.

"Well, Lisa, although I appreciate the offer, I'm afraid trying to get me home would only be a waste of both of our time."

"I don't have anything going on," I shrugged. "It's summer. I'm on break." I laid my head on my folded arm, looking levelly into the jar. "So what do we do first?" 

"You're really not letting this go?" 

"It's the most interesting thing that's ever happened to me." 

"Okay, Lisa. I'll humor you. But when we inevitably fail--and we will--you and I split ways."

"Deal," I nodded. 

Viivi's shape shifted from a glowing, burning ball of fire to a small woman, no more than six inches tall, dressed in a shining robe and with short, bleach-white hair. "Alright, let me out and let's get going."

"Where are we going?" 

"I'll explain on the way."
