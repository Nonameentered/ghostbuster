I arrived early. I always arrive early. I like the quiet before the job, the liminal space of time where there's nothing expected of me and I can sit alone and read. 

I was 44 chapters into J.D. Bright's third novel in his *Banners of the World's Cauldron* series and the quiet mid-afternoon booth at Denny's provided a nice place to focus on the drama unfolding. Would the disgraced Prince Soorenard redeem himself by besting the Barbarian Chieftain in the Palace Keep? Or would the Grand Inquisitor Welleran catch him before he passed through into the kingdom? Would the forest folk keep to their word and hold the river's fury or would they deceive the King and release the dam, plunging the countryside under a wave of murky water? 

I admit, I was obsessed with this book, with the author. 

The restaurant was scarce around me, the target wouldn't be stopping in until around 4 with her lawyer, so I had a few hours to kill. I ordered a cup of coffee and a cinnamon roll, something to snack on while I read and waited. The waitress remarked on my "brick of a book," and I shot her a raise of my eyebrows, not in the mood for talking to you. 

A woman across the restaurant was looking up from her laptop every so often, at me and then at the book I was holding. I wondered if maybe she was also a fan of this author's work. Or maybe she was curious about the 6'5" bald thug bent over a paperback in the restaurant alone. If her instincts were that I was strange and dangerous, her instincts were right. 

I was there to kill someone, a woman with a large estate undergoing an ugly divorce from a similarly well-off stock broker. Talks had failed apparently, and his legal team had hit a wall. He'd looked to my services to straighten it out the old fashioned way. The way they do it still in the Kingdom of Russ: *through blade and blood our courts uphold, the gods appeased and the corpses cold.* 

It wasn't the most glamorous job, but it was good money. 

The woman kept looking up, now with even more regularity. I tried to keep my head down, not arouse attention. I did not want to be bothered by small talk, the story was at a fever pitch now. The Grand Inquisitor had just revealed his double identity as The Hand of the People, the shadowy labor champion who had been stoking unrest among the Kingdom's peasanty, sending the Minister of Coin into a mental breakdown. 

She was walking toward me, her laptop under her arm. 

"Hello," she greeted me softly. 

I didn't look up from my book. "Hi." I hoped my tone was clear, I wasn't looking to make friends. 

"Are you enjoying the book?" 

"Yes."

"I wonder, may I join you? Pick your brain about it?" 

It was an odd request and it caught me off guard. Before I could answer, she was sitting across from me. 

"What do you like about that novel?" She asked me. "And spare no detail." 

She was a short woman, around 40, with the beginnings of crow's feet at the corners of her eyes. But despite that, she had an air of liveliness, an electricity in the way she moved and spoke. Her hair was straight and her smile was wide. Her eyes were hazel brown and held contact with mine.

"Well," I began, "J.D. Bright has made an entire fantasy world with believable characters and interesting development. I love the political intrigue, the moral questions, the action. He's the best fantasy author of our time, if you ask me." I don't know why I said so much. No one's ever asked me my thoughts on what I was reading except to be polite. 

"Would you say you identify more with Grand Inquisitor Gaznak or Prince Soorenard?" 

"Oh, wow. Well, that's the beauty of it. They're working against each other, but they're both compelling characters, one evil, yet unexpectantly good at times and one good, yet hesitantly evil at times. I'm rooting for and against both. I don't know who I want to win."

She nodded. "If you *had* to choose, who would you choose?" 

I thought about the question. "Neither," I told her. "Neither should win. Evil should win. Bright has painted a realistic world in this fantasy setting. Evil wins much more often than we think. The Barbarian Chieftain should win, the forest folk should betray the prince. They need to lose before they can be redeemed. 

She opened her laptop and began typing. "Tell me more."

"I think..." I closed my book and leaned forward. "Imagine this: the Kingdom is in ruins, the Prince, our protagonist up to this point, is killed because he hunted for glory in greed. That would be the greatest twist. The Hand of the People is found out and the Grand Inquisitor is now hunted by his own royal agency. He is on the run, now meeting the forest folk and rubbing shoulders with the Free Knights of the Plains. He has to use his manipulative goals to restore the Kingdom he himself destroyed."

She typed feverishly, every world I spoke. 

I asked her, "So, I take it you're a fan?" 

"Well... A little bit more than that." 

I sipped from my mug and chuckled. "You run a fan site or something?" 

"I run the books," she casually told me. "*I'm* J.D. Bright."

I swallowed the coffee wrong and began to cough. She laughed as she leaned over and patted me on the back. 

"You!? You're *the* J.D. Bright!?" I near-shouted in the quiet restaurant. "I thought he was a man!"

"Well, the sad fact is that low fantasy novels sell better when men write them," she shrugged. "I'm not too proud to sell out." 

"Well, what are you doing here, in a Denny's? Don't you have cabins in the woods or towers to write in? You're one of the most popular authors in the world right now." 

She seemed to blush at that. "I have amassed... quite a bit of clout, that's for sure. But I'll tell you, it's more curse than blessing. All the legal stuff, the TV rights, the family coming out of the woodwork looking for money... I wish I just wrote all my novels at once and moved to an island somewhere." She sighed. "But, I like breakfast places at this time of day, when there's not many people here but there's that hum in the air still." 

My mind and my heart were racing. J.D. Bright, right here, across the table from me, talking about her saga. 

"And besides, I'm meeting my lawyers here in a few hours. Sometimes popularity is *not* good on a marriage." She reached over the table and took a sip from my cup.
