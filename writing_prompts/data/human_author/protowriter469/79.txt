The wooden sign dangled from its post by a pair of chains. *Hasherwood.* The writing was ornate, clearly penned and painted with care by some proud villager. Beneath it was a sign of a different sort. *Condemned. Do not enter.* It's writing was jagged and panicked, the work of a frightened official on his way out. 

I urged my horse forward down the dirt trail where grass and weeds had begun to find root. The further into the wood we travelled, the quieter it became. Birds didn't twitter in the trees and squirrels didn't scurry across branches. Wind whispered over the the leafy treetops, but the air on the ground was still. 

The village was small, but the inhabitants had once been a clan of creative artisans who spent their time canning fruits and vegetables and preserving sweet jams and jellies. Their woodworking showed on the facades of their homes: intricately designed, constructed, and colored. The wood curled in spirals beneath thatched roofs and impressive craftsmanship framed large windows and doors on every structure.

But it was deathly silent in the town's square save for my horse's hooves planting on the brickwork. I tied Nessa to a horse post by the defunct town fountain and I donned my mask, a black head covering with glass-goggled eyes. 

My investigation would begin where it always does: the tavern. I pushed open the doors to find a great room thick with dust, the sunlight rays pouring through the slatted windows in straight lines. 

The chairs were stacked on top of the tables except at a seat in the corner, where a spent oil lamp loomed over parchment and a quill. I picked up the paper and read its sparce contents. 

*Mildred, the cats*

Behind me there was a rattling; the sound of a bottle wobbling in place. I whipped around, a knife in my hand, to see an empty liquor bottle sway slightly on the bar's counter. I rolled and pocketed the piece of paper. Despite the short message, it gave me a lead: Mildred. 

I investigated behind the bar. Spotted over the blankets of dust were paw prints, bigger than a housecat, but smaller than a dog. Interestingly, in places where the sunlight met the prints, there were scorch marks along the claw tips. I pulled a cloth from my pocket and dabbed at the print, hoping to pull something from it when I returned to my study. 

In my peripheral vision, I saw a pair of eyes gazing at me, glowing from atop the bar. There was a low growl in the creatures chest, a humming that vibrated in my bones. It lunged and I turned around and caught it on my gauntlet, where it scratched as it hissed and snarled. I let it get a few good, deep cuts in before I flung it across the room. 

The creature was covered in feathers, though they didn't seem to be from a recent kill. They were growing on its body, which was itself long, like a ferret. Notably, this was a large type of cat, akin to a bobcat, but with long, sharp nails and talon on its hind legs. 

Its back was raised with anger as it squared me up from the other side of the bar. When approaching a strange, frightened, and violent creature, it's important not to compromise your confidence or show any fear. I took my time, examining my gauntlet, which was dripping with some purple venom. This would be invaluable evidence. I wrapped another piece of cloth around it and set my sights back on the cat. 

"Is this all your doing?" I asked the animal. 

As it walked, it kept its gaze on me, its long nails tapping on the wooden floor with every stride. I retrieved a small crossbow from my hip, something good for crippling small game, but not enough to kill a man. Most of the time. 

I loaded my bolt and took aim. 

"If you know what's god for you, investigator," the cat spoke in a labored, unnatural tone, "you'll leave well enough alone." I lowered the weapon. This case continues to get more and more interesting. 

"You're capable of language?" I asked the animal, to which it gave a non-verbal affirmation. "Are you also capable of reason? What happened here?" 

"Run, you foolish man, before the night takes you as well."

That had settled it. I would camp here for the night.
