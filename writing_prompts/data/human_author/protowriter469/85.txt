The...floor, for lack of a better word, was hard, like glass. It wasn't quite cold, but not warm either. The stars above seemed to reflect on its surface, the clouds of the swirling galaxies sending purple and red light onto her clothes and skin. 

Amelia rubbed at her head, perplexed by the dark, quiet place she found herself in. Had she fallen? From where? And how could she get back, wherever that was? 

Growing fatigued by the gravity of such questions, she resigned herself to walking, her footsteps sharp taps against the glossy ground. She had no direction in mind, and even if she had, how could she know in which direction that would be? There were no obvious markers or trailheads planted in the ground. There would probably be no brochures or welcome centers either. It was just Amelia and the impossibly great expanse stretched above her. 

Walking sometimes has a strange effect of clearing one's mind, setting a tempo to thought and reflection, helping one to chart out their pasts and, perhaps, their futures. This was not one of those walks. The longer Amelia strolled through the cosmic darkness, the more clouded her memory became. Eventually, she began saying her name out loud, *Amelia, Amelia,* so that she wouldn't forget that either. 

She watched her feet step on the ground, one after another. In some places there were rough striations, like the sides of stone faces, uneven and rough under her step. Mostly, though, it was like walking on calm water. She counted the rough patches, their frequency seeming to increase over time. 

Something dull hit the top of her head as her eyes were fixed downward. Her vision flashed as the pain radiated through her eyes and sinuses and neck. Amelia looked up to see a tree planted before her, its leaves accompanies by pink blossoms. On the other side was a cabin with a brick chimney and smoke billowing from its top. 

Amelia rubbed at her sore head and walked around the tree and to the front of the little log home. The door was red, dried drips of paint crystallized on its hastily colored front. She gave it three short taps and stood politely on the other side.

The red door opened and a darkened face appeared through the crack.

"Yes?" Spoke the low, baritone voice.

"Hello. I'm Amelia." She stood with her hands folded in front of her skirt.

"Okay."

"...And I'm lost." 

"...Okay."

"Can you help me?" 

 There was something odd about his eye and the color of his skin. She couldn't say for sure, but the circle of his pupil seemed not quite circular. Despite the darkness all around her, she could almost say that his skin resembled no human pigment she'd ever seen either. 

"Umm..." He wondered aloud. "Okay." 

The door shut and she heard a jingling along the door's backside. It swung open again, revealing a large, round figure wearing a velvet robe and sucking from a long, thin pipe. He leaned down close to Amelia and she could see his face quite clearly.

"Are you...are you a frog?" 

"Toad," he answered. "Are you a man?"

"Woman," she replied. "Well, a girl at least." 

"Okay," he croaked as he turned around a strode back into the cabin.  

She followed him inside, expecting a tiny, homely cottage, but she was instead treated to a magnificent, sprawling mansion with marble columns and stone busts of frog--or, toad--heads lining the entryway. 

"Is this place bigger on the inside than outside?" 

The toad breathed out a cloud of smoke as he casually walked down the grand hallway. 

"Yes," he said over his shoulder. 

"Umm, can I ask you a question?" Amelia cooed, now suddenly worried about her manners in such a place.

"Okay."

"Where am I?" 

The huge toad stopped and surveyed his house before turning around to the little girl behind him. 

"The floor," he answered simply.

"The floor? Of what?"

"The universe."

His answer seemed obvious, yet absurd. "What does that mean?"

Smoke steamed from the slits of his nose. "You are in the place where all things unnatural come to rest, where the most wonderful *and* the most terrible things reside; where monsters and angels mingle, where myths and legends war..." He looked down at her wide eyes. "So, that sort of place."
