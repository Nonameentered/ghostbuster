The snow no longer felt cold. Another drink, another hot gulp of heat to keep the bite away, huddled between a dumpster and a makeshift cardboard shelter. I sighed, a wisp of steam rising in the air, thinner with every shaky breath.

The more I drank, the more death didn't seem so scary. I would fall asleep, that's all. I would simply drift away, one moment alive, in pain, alone, and the next, nothing.

My head pressed against the side of the dumpster as my mind started swimming, no longer able to hold complete thoughts. Instead, there were images, brief snippets of fleeting ideas and memories. I remembered my parents, my friends, dogs I'd owned, women I'd loved. In that dreamy, bittersweet moment, I wanted to stand, retreat from death and leave the bottle behind.

But I was stuck, either too frozen or too inebriated to convince my body to budge.

The rest was an abstract collage of thoughts, like a kaleidescope rotating in a darkening room.

Then, nothing.

Three chimes played and I opened my eyes. My attention was sharp now, no longer sluggish and confusing. I was sober somehow. Was I in a hospital? A shelter? Had someone found me?

I was facing a blue sky with low-resolution clouds sailing slowly by. A banner of words hung in the air: *Thank you for living! Experience brought to you by Life Industries.*

All at once it was as if I'd remembered some long-suppressed memory. I wasn't *him,* I wasn't *human.* I was me. I was this.

I grabbed at the headset and pulled it off my face. Rows of angels were plugged in, reclined in their seats, each experiencing a simulation of what life might be like for a person. Several stood to the side, discussing their experience. Some others sat quietly alone, sipping at a steaming cup of tea, clearly rattled by the lives they lived.

"How was everything?" A tall, dark-haired attendant gently took the headset from me.

"Umm..." I searched for the right words, something to adequately express the emotion I was feeling. "Catastrophic."

He nodded knowingly and helped my out of the seat. "It's a lot to think about, isn't it?"

"Is it accurate? Is that really how they live?"

"Some of them," he explained as he wiped down the headset and placed it in its cradle. "And yet, some live in the lap of luxury, wanting for nothing."

A shiver coursed through my wings. "Can I... Go again?"

The attendant furrowed his eyebrows. "Given how this affects the humans' world, we try to limit repeat experiences, especially minutes apart."

"I think I know how I can fix things for Reggie. I think I know where I messed up. I just need to--"

"Reggie's dead," the attendant said with finality. "Humans can't go back and fix things. Every decision is permanent. If you went back in, you'd be a whole new person."

Sadness stung at my eyes--some kind of homesickness and mourning. Was Reggie--was I--really gone? *Gone* gone?

"Why would humans be tortured like this?"

The attendant shrugged. "It's part of the plan."

Maybe the plan wasn't so holy after all.
