"Not enough food, not enough guns, not enough time..." Cesar threw a twig into the dying flames in front of him. "What are we even doing here?" The crowd around him murmured quiet, lazy agreements. 

Three miles north, the glinting lights of Columbus, New Mexico twinkled faintly. It was a small American village with a tiny force of only thirty or so soldiers patrolling it. Cesar knew what Pancho intended: sack the city, take the food and weapons--two of the three things they needed desperately. But no matter how many of these tiny towns they burned, it couldn't win them a second of time. The war was over. Everyone seemed to know it but Pancho. 

Captain Gomez approached the huddled group. "We're moving out in 15 minutes," he told them flatly. "We'll catch them as they sleep." 

This seemed like a good plan, Cesar thought. Although he didn't enjoy ransacking family homes and burning down children's bedrooms, he'd prefer to do it with as little retribution as possible. Does it make him a coward? Maybe. But, these northern white boys had interfered with their country for long enough. Cesar knew they were justified in their retribution, however futile it might be. 

They poured sand on the fire's embers and formed up, two columns, and marched northward toward Columbus. Cesar walked, both dreading the imminent arrival to the small civilian town and excited for it to be over as well. They would probably have food there; something besides wild game and stale tortillas. His mouth watered as he walked, his jostling rifle strapped over his shoulder, as empty as his stomach. 

There was a murmur among the columns, men whispering at first, and then pointing in the darkness of the pre-dawn morning. Lights had moved across the sky, too slow to be shooting stars, but too fast to be anything else. They loomed above the marching soldiers, a set of three shining orbs, before flying toward the border town only a couple miles away. 

Then there was a bright flash before a deafening boom. The soldiers scattered and fell to the ground, their mostly unloaded weapons tucked into their shoulders, as if they could wish bullets into being. In the distance they heard the rattling of machine gun fire, the blaring of sirens. There were screams and shouts, and something else. Snarling? Roaring? The hair on Cesar's neck stood as the otherworldly cries echoed through the pitch black of the night. 

Then, behind him there was a scream. There was a gunshot, close, and it sent a ringing into Cesar's ear. Half-dazed, he turned to see some shape flicker briefly into visibility by the flashes of gunfire. It-whatever it was--was enormous, picking up soldiers and tossing them away as if they were ragdolls. 

The columns dissolved, men abandoning their positions and running into the desert screaming, crying. Cesar just laid there, watching the carnage, hearing it in Columbus and right in front of him. The sounds melded together into some kind of strange white noise, like a busy city street or the sounds of the forest in a rainstorm. He imagined himself in either place, the smell of flautas being freshly pressed, their steam rising, joining the laughter and indistinct conversation, or the fresh smell of streaming, dripping water, dropping and flowing to the delight of so many frogs and birds and bugs. 

Something grabbed his arm. Someone. "Let's go!" He shouted. Cesar didn't recognize him, couldn't see his face in the dark. 

The both fled, heading toward the burning city in the distance. Why? Wasn't there more fighting there?

"I don't have any ammo," Cesar told his companion.

"Me neither," he replied between labored, huffing breaths. "But they do."

"The Americans?" 

His partner didn't answer but only kept running.

They arrived at the gates of Columbus exhausted. Cesar's vision was tunned, and his entire body ached from the two-mile sprint. Columbus itself was still burning, Americans rushing back and forth with pales of water and limp, torn-apart bodies. 

The carnage was unreal, more than he had expected to see that day, or any day for that matter. This was supposed to be a simple raid, but he could see now that this outpost had more than thirty soldiers. There were hundreds with hundreds of guns and cannons aimed South. 

An American shouted from inside the gates of the city. It was English, and Cesar didn't know very much English. The American was a stern, bushy-mustached white man with sunken eyes and deep wrinkles framing his mouth. Cesar's partner returned the American's hollers with broken, shaky English. 

"What are you telling him?" Cesar asked.

"I'm telling him we were camped across the border and rushed when we heard fighting; that we came here to help but were attacked also." 

"Oh," Cesar responded. It was a good lie, far better than the truth. Around the two Mexican soldiers, a smattering of Pancho Villas men began trickling in. The American soldier looked on them first with suspicion before waving them inside, handing them pales of water and directing them toward burning buildings. 

For the next couple hours, Cesar was an American fireman, extinguishing flames on buildings he was mere hours from burning down himself. 

When the sun rose, what was left of the city-just a few hundred soldiers, civilians, and Mexican troops, assembled at the city gates looking southward. A large cube hung in the sky, three shining lights glittering from its fa√ßade. Dust was rising in the distance just beneath it. A second assault. Headed this way.
