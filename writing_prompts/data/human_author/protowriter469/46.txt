Her eyes were puffy and red, tears long exhausted. She walked with tired resignation from weeks of grappling with her impending death. Would it be quick, she wondered. Would she feel the dragon's teeth sink into her flesh? Or might the beast prefer to cook her alive first, her anguish a delight before a tasty treat? 

It was a lot for a seven-year old contemplate.

The previous night's snowfall crunched under her feet, leaving tracks behind her. Sir Thorngood held her hand tightly lest she run for the trees. What would be the point of that? To freeze to death? At least with the dragon there was the *chance* of it being quick and painless.

Mother and father stayed back in the village on the estate. Since she had been selected, they had pivoted their attention to their other children. Her brothers and sisters were "viable heirs," Sir Thorngood had flippantly explained.

"Alright now, girl. A little ways further and we'll reach our destination. Take heed now, you must not run. Dragons are known for their cruel pursuits, to us like cats on mice." The knight pulled a vial from his sleeve. "Here is milk of the poppy. It's a final gift from your mother. It will make it hurt... Less."

She took the small glass vessel and held it in her mitten. She didn't want to feel pain, but less did she want now to give her parents the satisfaction. The young girl arched her arm back and threw the bottle into the leafless, winter woods.

"Well," Sir Thorngood sighed, "I can't say I would have done that."

"You can tell my parents I died with pain in my flesh and hatred in my heart!" Her shouts echoed through the forest, shrill and furious.

"I can tell them anything I like, little girl," he snorted. "Come along now, I'd like to be home for supper."

He gave her little arm a hard tug, causing her to yelp as she stumbled forward.

Soon, they were upon the alter, the place where the dragon and the kingdom agreed to their terms: one maiden of royalty each winter for peace in the land. Her life was the price for another year of unscortched farms, houses, and keeps.

The altar itself was a round stone slab. Just beyond it was a wooden hollow where the trees bent into a wide, wicked circle. A rumble shook the ground and the air; Sir Thorngood gulped and quivered in place.

"Have you the sacrifice?" A low, deep voice spoke from the black circle.

"The maiden is here, dragon. Do you promise on your honor to keep peace in the land?"

"I do," the voice replied.

Sir Thorngood pushed the girl onto the slab, where she fell onto her hands and knees. Her eyes looked down on the cold rock, paralyzed with terror. She had hoped she might be brave at this point. She had hoped to steel her nerves and face her fate with courage. But she was just a girl after all, and this is where she would perish.

"I leave her to you then. May her life satisfy you."

She heard the knight's footsteps retreat back down the snowy path. Tears found her eyes and stung as they welled.

"Oh, young one. Why do you cry?"

The low voice was closer now, perhaps emerged from its hollow. She could only whine her restrained sorrow and anger to herself.

"I am not going to hurt you, you know," the voice had a gravel to its edge, a low thrumming sound that vibrated her bones.

Footsteps landed just before her, light and delicate. The young girl braved a glance upward to see...

Another young girl?

"You look hun-gry!" The strange girl said with delight. A smile was painted across her young, freckled face. Behind her was a small crowd of other girls, each holding a basket with fruits and breads; one had a dress draped over her arm.

Behind them all was a towering dragon with wicked scales shimmering green and blue in the white sunlight.

"Oh , don't worry about Mary," the freckled girl said with a confident thumb pointed backwards. "Harmless as a house cat. Unless, of course, you show up late for class!"

A chuckle emerged from the crowd of girls behind her.

"Come on, now. Up you go! We have so much to show you!"

"Wait... What is this?" the sacrificial girl's knees were still weak, her face still wet with grief.

"This is..." the freckled girl began, only for the crowd to answer in unison: "The Maiden's Academy of Withcraft!"

"We have chocolate!" one of the girls excitedly squeaked.
