There was a chill in the breeze tonight, the first signs of fall moving its way in. I'll need to start bringing a heavier coat to the office soon if I don't want to catch something. The locals around here seem unfazed by the creeping cold--for them its natural; a part of the cycle. For an Arizona transplant like myself, it was part of a cruel routine. How did anyone live here before central heat? Animals! How do they do it?

I pulled my light blazer tight around my body as I stiffened my posture, an ill attempt to retain any amount of heat that I could. Since I've been here for, what?, four years now?, I've been managing a level of misery. Maybe it's the seasonal depression: the sticky summers, the brutal winters. Maybe it's the fact that, despite being 25, successful, and healthy, I've had no luck in the dating market. Tinder has turned up no (lasting) matches, the bars are stocked with middle-age divorcees and Tea Party truckers. I'm a fish out of water. A fish in the middle of a very dry, very cold desert. 

The wind swept up, shaking the trees and billowing against my poorly-insulated clothing. There was the chilly air that bit to the bone. It's be here for eight months, only to come right back when I least expected it. 

A small dirt devil--a tiny, breezy tornado--whipped up some garbage in my path. The cold all over my body pushed me through it, finding the shortest distance between me and my car. A small piece of paper struck me in the face and stuck against my nose and mouth. I ripped it away, prepared to crumble it up and throw it back to the sidewalk. But my better judgement prevailed. There was a trashcan in the parking lot, I'd dispose of the litter there. 

As I marched on, I inspected the little soft piece of trash. It was a napkin. *Gross,* I thought. I was probably just slapped in the face with someone's blown nose. *Or worse.* In my morbid curiosity, I uncrumpled the napkin and peered inside. 

"SEE YOU TONIGHT" was written in all caps and a feminine scrawl. That's sad, I thought. Someone wrote this, probably on a cocktail napkin at a bar, looking forward to a hookup. The second party, apparently, was not interested. Or maybe this is a post-coital napkin. *Ew.* I'll never say those words together again. 

I came to the trash can, but some strange urge stopped me from throwing it away immediately. There was a smell to the trash, a perfume. Yes, that was it: the napkin was sprayed with some feminine scent, something subtle and almost spicy. It was alluring, intoxicating. Damn, I was lonely. 

I couldn't tell you why I didn't throw away that napkin right there and then, but I didn't. I pocketed the trash after folding it neatly and went straight for my car. 

Once inside, I cranked the heat to maximum, overkill for a 62-degree day, and made my way home. 

I showered, watched some TV, made a modest dinner, and went to bed. This is the bachelor routine. Not glamorous, I know, but it is what it is.

MY phone woke me up to my xylophone-toned alarm, increasing in volume the longer I ignored it. I reached over the grab it, but my hand landed on something soft. I opened my eyes to to the bleary dim bedroom to see what I was feeling. 

It was the napkin. SEE YOU TONIGHT ❤️. 

Was the heart always there? When did I put this on my nightstand? In my morning delirium, I tried to retrace my steps from the night before. I got home, showered in the bathroom, took my clothes off there too, deposited them in the laundry basket. I only bring my watch and phone out with me.

My phone was getting impatient, the trilling tones now blaring for me to get up. 

I picked it up and swiped the alarm off. It revealed a picture I didn't expect and wasn't sure what to do with. There was a woman, sipping from a drink at what looked like a nearby bar. She wasn't smiling. Her expression was bored and serious, her eyes gazing directly into the phone's camera. 

My first thought was that, at some point, I'd picked up the wrong phone--switched it with someone at work. But this one recognized my thumbprint and it was loaded with all of my apps. When? Where had this changed? How?  

It was 7:12 already. I needed to get ready for work. The mystery would have to wait. 

By 8:00 I was pulling into the car park and stepping out, breakfast shake in hand and teeth chattering in the unexpected cold front. 

"Morning, Paul," my cubicle neighbor greeted me. 

"Randy," I tipped my proverbial cap. 

"Do anything interesting last night?" This was the same question Randy asked me every morning, same inflection, same strange hint of humor, as if I were galivanting in sex-fueled escapades in my off time. 

"Nope," I replied, as always. "Actually," I stopped before sitting. "Do you know this woman?"  I showed him my phone.

He squinted at the picture of the bored woman sipping a drink. "Hmm... looks familiar, but I can't say from where. Honestly, at my age, any woman under 40 looks like a supermodel!" He chortled his answer, clearly not taking it seriously. "Where's you meet her?"  

"That's the thing," I took my phone back. "I didn't. This picture was here when I woke up this morning."

He barked roughly. "Reminds me of my days in the Navy! Thank God we didn't have cell phones back in those days!" 

"It's not like that," I told him, waving off any unwelcomed stories of clandestine southeast adventures. "Do you think I was hacked?" 

He shrugged. "Beats me." 

I sat down at my desk, and he swiveled back to his. I unpacked my laptop and plugged it into my workstation dock. As the machine woke up, I opened my drawer to pull out my headphones. There was a folded napkin inside. 

As I unfolded it, the perfume smell filled my nostrils, a hypnotizing, fragrant scent, like roses and mint. The letters inside were the same: SEE YOU TONIGHT, but instead of a heart, there was a lipstick imprint of a kiss, the middle seemingly chewed up, and still somewhat damp. 

I dropped the napkin on the floor next to my trash bin, only to find it filled with balled up napkins, each with writing smudged and scrawled. 

"What the f--" I sat up straight. My computer had woken up. The screen showed the woman, now looking up for her drink, her dark eyes glaring right at me. 

There was a napkin and pen in front of her. 

SEE YOU TONIGHT.
