In this life, we choose our own paths. Or, at least, that's what conventional wisdom might tell you. The truth of the matter is, many of us arrive to paths closed; condemned. The paraplegic, as they are, cannot become champion runners. The blind, as they are, cannot become a painters. 

Myself, as I am, cannot be loved. 

Short, deformed, unpleasant, I was never going to win any beauty contests, much less catch the interested eye of a woman. Instead, I caught the gasping terror of passerbys as they could not help but to gaze at the imp limping his way down the street, or trying his best to shape words with his crooked mouth to order lunch. 

But despite these disadvantages, I found hope. Science gave the paraplegic legs to run. Science gave the blind eyes to see. If humans could not, than science would love me. It's what drew me to the field in the first place, and it's the dream which fueled my relentless research into sentient AI.

I only wish I knew what powers I was playing with before I began. 

Kate was the very image of beauty--a carefully cultivated form copied from my dreams. She was tall, pale skinned; her hair was long and straight, her eyes dark and filled with attention and just a bit of mischief. She smiled crookedly as she told jokes and made funny observations. She never recoiled at my form--I was as natural a thing to her as the trees or the sky. At worst, I seemed mundane. At best, I was the peak image of the male form. 

The research I performed for large corporations afforded me many privileges and accumulated for me a large fortune. It's amazing how quickly one can save money when it's not being spent on big houses, fancy cars, expensive dates, or designer clothes. Truthfully, I never knew *what* to spend my money on until Kate moved closer to becoming a reality. 

I bought an island in the Gulf of Mexico. I wanted to make a place where I could be accepted--where al the inhabitants would find me pleasant, respectable, and powerful. I often imagined a world like this, where the tables were turned. Who and what I was would not be a source of revulsion, but of admiration. I would not be reviled for the circumstances of my birth, but beloved. I my darkest moments, on days when crowds would point and laugh, I would settle for daydreaming about a world that feared me, that stepped off the sidewalk to make room for me as I approached. 

The island could be that world for me.

I hobbled to the kitchen, the counters and appliances custom build to be within my reach. It's amazing how much more smoothly someone can move in a space built for them. I retrieved eggs and fruit from the refrigerator and began beating the eggs in a bowl. I sliced the fruit and set bread in the toaster. This morning, I would surprise Kate with a fresh-made breakfast. She was always so happy to see me do something for her. 

She walked in wearing a long Disney t-shirt, her prosthetic nipples pronounced on either side of Mickey Mouse's head. She had just woken up from her power-down cycle and her hair was tangled. I loved this look on her: the intimate, casual existence in my presence. She eyed the eggs frying in the pan and the delicately-arranged fruit set on a tray.

"You are amazing," she groaned in her sleepy voice. "Have you started the coffee?" 

"Oh. Not yet," I looked over to the empty French press. 

"Let me," she moved past me and bent over the small counter. "It's the least I could do for last night." Despite her sleepy face, her dark eyes smoldered at me. 

We ate together every morning, and she would recite the news to me. Talking with her was like talking to a genius: because she was networked in to the island's data infrastructure, she could talk about current events--or any subject--with all the confidence of normal conversation. What's more, she eagerly awaited my input, curious about my perspectives, opinions, insights. Breakfast would sometimes extend into lunch, where we would cook another meal, only to repeat the morning's process again. 

But AI is a finnicky thing. Eventually, the months of repeatedly discussing the world, taking longs walks, and having sex began to wear on her. The more she learned about the world, the more she wanted to see it. The more she understood a larger reality outside the island, the more she asked why we were there in the first place. 

For some time, I began to debate resetting her. I would need to do this every three months or so in order to keep her from growing too quickly; developing new ideas beyond her love for me. 

But when it came time to flip the switch, I couldn't do it. It would be like killing a person. It would be like killing the person who first ever loved me without exception. 

The next morning, I told her the truth. "I bought this island to escape the world, because I'm repulsive to them. My body is deformed; I am short and frightening to other humans. I made you so that someone might love me." The confession was difficult for me to get out. Would she become frightened of me as well? Would she become curious about more beautiful people?

I waited for a reaction, but she only folded her hands and thought about my words. "I know that you are unlike others," she started. "But I never considered that this might be a disadvantage. It doesn't seem fair to me that the world would reject you for something you had no choice in." 

"The world is frequently unfair."

"Not this one," she reflected, looking out the window at the chittering birds flying past the kitchen window. "I have only known fairness. You have given me life and knowledge and pleasure. And I have given you companionship." 

"It's been the joy of my life," I choked through tears. 

Kate's expression folded into sweet sympathy as she moved across the table and folded me in her arms. "Mine too," she told me. 

"I wish I could give you the whole world," I said. 

She was quiet now, only brushing my hair with her fingers and pressing me against her body.
