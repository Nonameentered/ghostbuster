"Science has no monopoly on animal testing, I'm afraid." The doctor seemed to float through the room in his large lab coat with his hands folded behind his back. "Yes, in studying the realms of the metaphysical, small creatures frequently come in handy." 

"Is it safe then?" One of the residents peered through a glass container at a rat drinking from his water bottle. 

"Oh! Quite safe, yes." The doctor joined her in watching the small rodent drink. "Or, do you mean safe for us or safe for the animals?" 

"I was meaning the animals, but now I'm curious about the other as well." 

"Yes to humans--mostly--and no to the animals. Sorry, little rat. Progress marches on!" The doctor tapped on the glass, frightening the small mammal and sending him running to the corner. "Onward, then!" 

"Doctor, I'm sorry. Can you tell me about this one?" A young man asked as he pointed to a rat set apart. 

"Ah. I've named this one Gene." 

"For gene editing experiments?" A woman asked. 

"No, no. Because he possesses the power of a genie! Almost." 

"Almost?" 

"Yes! We were able to isolate the material that enchants djinns and genies with the power to bend the universe according to one's will. Unfortunately...well, it's not an exact science." 

The young man stepped forward, looking to the doctor with permission. When the doctor nodded, the young man asked a question: "I wish for a sandwich." 

The crowd of residents waited for something to happen, but nothing did. 

"Did you see what happened?" The doctor asked the group.

There was a murmuring no, and many shaking heads. 

"The rat simultaneously grants what you wish for *and* its exact opposite. You not only received your sandwich, but at the very same instant, you were subtracted one sandwich."

"So...it's a useless enchantment then?" 

"Useless!? No! Not at all! Gene here represents one of the greatest metaphysical discoveries of all time. Just watch!" The doctor leaned close to Gene's enclosure. "Gene, I wish I were riding a horse." 

Nothing happened. 

"You see!? No horse! Moving on!" 

The crowd, confused, continued on their tour.
