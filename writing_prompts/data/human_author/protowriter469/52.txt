My name isn't Mildred. I'm not an 80-year old woman. I didn't emigrate here from Poland in 1952 and I wasn't married for 44 years to an industrial pipe fitter specialist.

But if you were to look up the owner of my house, that's who you'd find. I hate to tell you this--especially now that you know so much--but Mildred? She's dead.

Now, don't worry. I didn't kill her. I don't kill. But I did bury the body and move into her home. You see, Mildred is what I like to call an *abandoned unicorn*: a widowed, first-generation immigrant with no kids or extended family. No one will know she's dead for another ten years. Maybe 15 if I'm lucky. 

Yes, it's very sad. But don't worry. I'm going to take care of Mildred's place for her while she's gone, feed her cats, water her plants. That sort of thing.

I don't want it to be this way. I don't want to spend my sleeping hours in a house filled to the brim with unsettling Polish dolls and a weird fish smell despite living the most landlocked state in the union.

But, reader, I don't have a choice. I can't rent an apartment. I can't buy a house. I can't even get a job.

Every night, around midnight, the entire world forgets I exist.

Take that in for a second.

Every photo of me disappears, every official document that bears my signature, every memory in people's minds, all gone. So it's here, in Mildred's quiet, vacant abode, that I rest and eat.

I spend my days doing crime, of course. I mean, come in, who wouldn't? If I rob a store, the security footage deletes itself. Steal a car with witnesses present? Suddenly everyone forgets what I look like the next day. I've been to jail before, but it's only a matter of time before they're forced to turn me loose. There's never any record of me being put in there in the first place.

So, my life can be exciting. But it's mostly coasting through a fairly sordid routine: wake up, feed cats, feed self, coffee at a local shop, CRIME, come home, feed cats, feed self, go to bed.

But then one day, when I went to get my coffee, the batista asked me if I'd like 'the usual.'
