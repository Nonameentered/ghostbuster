Thanks!

1) I'd be lying if I told you I didn't get a lot out of people enjoying my stories. It's always amazing to get a compliment or hearing that something I wrote meant something to someone. I wish writing was a more social activity!

2) I like to pay attention to senses beyond sight and look for similarities between things. For example, someone could walk into an old room, or they might walk into a decrepit, dark, and derelict space where the mildew stuck to one's tongue and the old floorboards moaned under even the most cautious of steps. Tell the story through sensation, not exposition alone. 

3) I like the ideas of optimistic dystopia. That is, the world has ended, our modern creature comforts are no longer available, and we must turn back to nature. Max Brooks, in *World War Z,* has a chapter that speaks of Hollywood elites who find happiness and purpose as craftsmen--something that more directly improves lives. I've been wrestling with a story about a man who, one day, finds himself alone in the world. A former Catholic priest, he is used to some level of isolation, but not like this. Eventually, mythical creatures start filling the world when he isn't looking. In the ruins of the old world there is something new. 

I'd want to live there.
