He laid in his bed, headphones on and Megadeth blaring into his ears. There was nothing to do in this little nowhere town. No one worth seeing. No place to be.  

He couldn't live here forever. Obviously. Something would have to change, and soon. Senior year was drawing to a close and mom and dad were never shy about reminding him that he'd be "out on his own" when his time was up. 

Where would he go? Not college. *Not* the military. Who would hire him? What skills did he have? 

He'd never admit it to his parents, but the loneliness was the scariest part of leaving. For all their faults, he'd miss mom and dad. He'd miss little Stephen. Well, not so little anymore. He was basically a person now. 

A tear stung at the corner of his eye and he pressed the headphones tighter onto his ears.

*Feeling paranoid, true enemy or false friend?*  
*Anxiety's attacking me and my air is getting thin.*  
*I'm in trouble for the things I haven't got to yet*  
*I'm chomping at the bit and my palms are getting wet.*  
*Sweating bu--*

The headphones were ripped off his head and he recoiled in surprise. 

"Shane! Didn't you hear me?" Mom was standing over him, one hand a fist holding his headphones, the other impatiently fixed to her hip.

"What!?" Shane barked back.

"Dinner!" The invitation was neither warm nor welcoming. Mom marched out of the room, leaving the door wide open behind her. 

Shane pivoted off his bed and begrudgingly marched downstairs toward the dinner table. When he was gone, they'll have wished they had been nicer, he thought. I won't call, I won't write. 

He shook his head free of the sad thoughts that might make him tear up again, and he took his spot at the table. Stephen was seated across from him, his eyes open wide, eyebrows raised, and a smirk across his face. 

"What are you looking at?" Shane hissed. 

"Someone's in *trou-bull*," Stephen answered in a sing-song tone. 

Shane scoffed at the sentiment, but mom's and dad's face were stoic and serious. Something *was* up. 

Dad cleared his throat. "Your report card came in today, Shane." 

*oh.*

"Would you care to explain?" Dad laid the tri-fold paper between them. The report was marked with red pen, clear Ds and Fs in boxes on the page. 

"What is going on with you?" Mom's words had a fury behind them. This wasn't a check-in. It was an accusation. 

"You used to be so smart," Dad added. "You used to *care*." 

"What if Stephen takes after you?" 

Stephen's smirk was now full smile as he pantomimed playing guitar and bobbing his head back and forth. 

There was no food on the table. This was a "family meeting." Or, more accurately, a "Shane interrogation." 

Backed into the corner, Shane was started sweating. There truly was no excuse for why he was skipping classes, smoking pot, sleeping through the day. Well... not one that mom or dad would care about. Shane was their first, the one they made all their mistakes on. Stephen was the miracle baby, the one who would succeed. They wanted Shane gone so they could give Stephen all their focus and love and attention. 

The walls seem to curve into themselves. A headache developed in Shane's mind. There was too much. Too much! The voices overlapped; the noise grew louder. 

There was a loud *thump*. 

Shane found himself on the floor behind his chair. Looking left and right, he saw mom and dad on the floor as well, their faces painted with confusion. 

Looking up, Shane saw something truly bizarre. 

He was still seated at the table, turned around, looking at himself. A mom and a dad were seated also, peering down at the floor.

The mom at the table stood up and shrieked, sending her chair backwards on top of the mom on the floor. 

Stephen was petrified, both on the floor and table. 

Dad instinctively went into defense mode. "Who--what--how--" but the situation trumped his higher brain functions. He couldn't comprehend what was happening. 

Shane stood up from the floor at the same time he stood up from the table. They turned around and looked at each other. 

"Who are you?" was the first coherent phrase from the now eight people in the room. 

"Who are *you?"* Table Shane retorted. His brows were furrowed, but he was not angry or scared. It was curiosity; interest. 

"I...my gun..." Dad announced. He fled from the room, the dad from the floor jumping up and chasing him. 

The Stephens cried. The moms rushed to scoop one up. The Shanes stared.  

There was a gunshot.
