"Rendezvous just means *appointment* in French," Kid Thunder muttered to himself as he thumbed the webpage down. "I would've thought there'd be more to it."

The alleyway was dark, a dripping pipe plopping droplets somewhere unseen.

"I wonder if in France *appointment* means a sexy meetup." He put away his phone, unsure how to search that one up. Now didn't seem like the time to think about French anyways. But without the distraction his bright screen gave him, the anxiety had much more room to grow in his mind.

Kid Thunder wasn't afraid of the dangerous side streets or gang-infested corridors that wound their way through the city. If anything, *this* was his element. Together with Ultiman, he would invade these slums and scour the city streets of criminal scum.

So, no, it wasn't the criminals that had Kid Thunder sweating around his tight, checkered, cologne-saturated collar. If Ultiman found out--

"*Psst. Up here."* The whisper whizzed through the air like an arrow. Kid Thunder looked up to the gap between the plaster buildings to find her sitting off the ledge, her feet swinging playfully. "Get up here!"

He smiled wide and leapt onto the fire escape, scaling the creaking wrought iron trellises with ease. Kid Thunder made sure to work in a flipping flourish or two.

You know.

Just because.

His feet landed softly at the ledge's edge beside the young black-haired beauty.

"Sup?" He nodded with a crooked grin.

Her nose crinkled. "Is that *cologne*?"

Kid Thunder's face went red and his words tumbled out frantically. "Oh, well...uhm...that's, uh--just a little bit..." His foot nearly slipped off the building as his charisma evaporated.

"You are such a dork!" She barked, throwing her head back in laughter.

Kid Thunder smiled but pressed his finger to his lips. "Keep it down. No one can catch us here!"

She stood up and walked, one foot in front of the other, balancing on the ledge, toward him. "Luckily for you," she said, flattening the collar of his shirt against his chest, "I like dorks. And I don't care who knows it."

"Not even your dad?"

Her hands fell off his shirt and dropped to her sides. The flirty game was over. "I told you not to worry about that."

"I know," he nodded, "but it's kind of hard not to think about."

"Why?" She floated from the ledge to the building's roof, black ribbons of smoke wafting from her feet.

Kid Thunder stepped after her hastily. "If Nihilis finds out about us, he'll use it against...me."

"And if your boss finds out about it he won't?" She was walking away now, her body swaying in the moonlight, sending Kid Thunder's heart racing in his chest.

"Well, no, he will too. That's why we have to keep a low profile. Nobody can know."

She turned around and floated toward him. "Kid Thunder," she hissed his name, "are you ashamed of being seen with Lady Rien?"

It was the wrong time to bring it up, but Kid Thunder remembered that *rien* meant *nothing* in French. It sounded much cooler than "nothing." The French really had language figured out.

He took her hands in his, and she slowly floated down to the roof. "Nothing could make me ashamed of what we have," he cooed in the small space between them. "But I've never felt this way about anyone before. And I don't want anybody or anything to get in the way."

Now it was *her* heart's turn to thump away. She leaned in, the heat radiating between both their bodies, her lips parting to take his.

*Flash!*

A blinding light flickered just as the skin of their lips swept each other's.

"No way, dude!" A voice called from across the roof.

Kid Thunder and Lady Rien turned their heads quickly. A man stood there, staring at the screen of his big, fancy camera.

"Kid Thunder and Lady Rien? **In Love!?**"

Lady Rien stomped on the roof, sending black shadows over the space between them. A shadowy tentacle lifted the man in the air and slammed him down.

"Whoa, wait!" Kid Thunder called, rushing to the man's side.

"Get his camera!" She shouted, pointing to the expensive-looking gadget laying sideways next to the groaning voyeur.

"I need to see if he's okay!" Kid Thunder protested.

"Ugh!" She stomped again, shadows pulling the camera into the ground and reappearing it in Lady Rien's hands. "Hey, peeping Tom!" She called out. The man made eye contact with the young villain as she effortlessly crushed the camera in her hand.

"Okay," he said casually. "It's connected."

"Connected?" Kid Thunder asked.

"To the internet. It gets back to the agency immediately."

"The agency? What agency?" Lady Rien rose into the air, the space around her darkening as she drew nearer to the man.

"The news. Obviously," he chuckled. "Everyone's going to know about your risqué little meetup."

Now definitely wasn't the time to bring it up, but *risqué* just means *risk* in English.
