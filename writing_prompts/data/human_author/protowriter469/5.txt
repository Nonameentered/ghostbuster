A pebble tumbled through the grates and fell down to the floor of my cell. It was the most exciting thing I'd seen in three years.

I buried my face in my knees again, curled my dark, frigid corner of Hell. If I was quiet, if I remained unseen, unnoticed, maybe I could avoid a thousand years of boiling or being torn in two by the giants in the arenas.

This was better, I reminded myself. Not good, but better. And there's a rock now. A little better all the time.

I sighed, my breath a cloud in front of me. Can you believe I used to be somebody? I used to have opinions on boats and colognes. I used to live in a golf course.

If only I could reverse things; spend 77 years in here, and an eternity in life. God, I would change so much. Not that you're listening.

But I would've given more, listened more, cared more. Not for any petty, maniacal god, but for myself. Because sitting here for so long has made me realize that the things I miss and the things that really mattered has always been the people I love.

I sniffed as a hot tear made its way down my cheek.

Something up top heard me. Footsteps approached, two feet sprinting quickly across the brimstone ground.

I curled tighter around myself, wishing I could shrink, that I could disappear. I wanted to never be seen again, be so tiny and insignificant that the monsters would simply pass me by.

Two hands grabbed the bars of the grate and slowly dragged it away. I squinted hard, shivering, wincing.

"Good morning, neighbor." The words were whispered.

I dared to peek up. An older man, unburned, unbroken, stood before me in a red cardigan and slacks. He smelled like cinnamon.

"You look cold," he told me as he shrugged off the jacket, "Maybe this will help."

He draped his cardigan over my shoulders and I winced as it touched me. Every touch, every second of contact was like fire on my skin. The cardigan was warm, but I was waiting for pain to start.

"I think I can help you get on out of here," he told me, looking me straight in the eyes. "Would it be okay with you if I unlocked your chains?"

I didn't answer. My mouth forgot how to work, I'd forgotten how to speak. My words would be used against me anyway, the gentle man turned into a towering demon, laughing at my trust.

Two clicks and the shackles fell off.

"There. Doesn't that feel better?"

When I didn't answer, he stayed quiet to. But I sensed him moving beside me, taking a place on the floor with me.

He started to hum some tune, something vaguely familiar. It touched a part of my mind that hadn't been tortured yet.

*"Would you be mine, could you be mind? Won't you be my neighbor?"*

I'd seen that show. I recognized him now. It was *Mister Rogers.*

Or, it was a demon pursuing my most protected thoughts. It was after the time I'd spent with my mother before she passed. It was carefree childhood, wood panel walls and shag carpets, VHS tapes and Lite Brite machines.

"Sure is drafty in here, neighbor."

Sure is.

"If you want I can take you someplace much more comfortable."

A volcano's cauldron? A room filled with rabid dogs? A coffin?

"We're all neighbors up there. We're all friends."

"Are you real?" I blurted clumsily, the syllables muddled and my volume ghoulish.

"I understand why you wouldn't believe me," he nodded. "It does seem awfully silly that I might be here."

I did find it strange that a character from my childhood was sitting in a frozen cell in the bowels of Hell with me.

"But I assure you, I'm real, and I'm here to take you home."

"Why?" I groaned through clenched teeth.

"Because I believe there's a little good in everybody. And a Heaven where I know you are hurting is not a Heaven for me at all. You don't deserve to be here."

"I do deserve it," I shot back. And I did. I'd hurt people, betrayed them, poisoned the world, hoarded my wealth. I WAS a bad person.

"Is that so?" He sat back and nodded. "Well then I guess we're going to be roommates. Because as long as you're here, I don't want to be anywhere else."

700 years later, when the cardigan still hadn't killed me, I asked if the offer was still on the table.
