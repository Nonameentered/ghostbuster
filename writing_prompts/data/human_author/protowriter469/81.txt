The light turned yellow, and then red. I slowed my car to a stop at the intersection before the University, which fed about ten lanes of traffic and took forever to change back to green. Impatiently, I tapped on the steering wheel. I wasn't running late, mind you, but I like getting to the classroom early, making tea, and mentally preparing for a day of lectures and answering sophomoric philosophy questions from senior students who should know better by now.

A car pulled beside me, inching further into the intersection than what the painted stripes dictated. I scoffed at his hubris--his anxious anticipation like a child dancing outside of a bathroom stall. I pulled forward by small degrees to get a better look at the testy driver.

He was wearing large sunglasses and a beanie hat, driving a beat-up Toyota Carolla, tapping impatiently on his steering wheel. He looked familiar, though I could only see his side profile. Where did I know him from? Was he one of my former pupils? Every so often my class sees a geriatric student attend in order to chase some foolhardy degree which will serve them naught in retirement.

No, he wasn't one of those.

I inched closer, until my window was parallel with his. Our eyes met, his through dark shades, mine through discerning brows, when it struck me.

"Son of a bitch!" I shouted. He sped through the red light, narrowly missing a minivan, and I followed, swerving around traffic all the same. My class started in an hour, but this took precedence: the rogue doppelganger, inexplicably here, at my place of work. Where was he going? Where was he coming from? If I needed to ram his car into a ditch, I would.

\---------------------------------------------------------

I've never been one to break laws, always the strict, stringent rule-follower. When you live as I've lived, you need to keep a code. But as I pulled into the intersection, in a place where I could be spotted, my anxiety shifted into quiet panic.

The light turned red and I slowed to a stop. Ten lanes of traffic fed into this intersection and it always took forever to change back to green. Impatiently, I tapped on the steering wheel and began inching into the intersection.  In the past, I might've scoffed at people like this, who pull into intersections in their testy hubris. But this was different. This was life or death.

A car pulled beside me and I worried it would be a cop, staring me down, ready to pull me over as soon as the light changed. I couldn't afford to be stopped without a license, registration, or insurance. I especially couldn't afford to be stopped just outside from where one of us *worked*. If he found me, he'd try to kill me. Or worse.

I recognized the car's hood from my peripheral vision. Not a cop. A Mercedes hood ornament snuck up like a shark in a bay, threatening me. Against my better judgement, I turned my head and looked straight at the driver.

Through my shaded glasses, I looked into his pensive stare, his red beard speckled with white follicles and bushy eyebrows furrowed as recognition washed over his face.

I pushed the gas pedal to the floor. He followed behind me.
