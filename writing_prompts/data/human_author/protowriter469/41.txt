Both detectives were on the observation side of the glass. Miller sipped from a styrofoam cup of old, burnt coffee he'd brewed when he first clocked in 12 hours ago. Park chewed minty gum from the lobby vending machine. Neither smell complimented the other very well, and maybe they would have noticed it had their minds not been preoccupied with the figure on the other side of the window. 

She sat calmly, her handcuffed wrists resting on her lap. They didn't have a name for her. When she was booked, they ran her prints, searched her for ID, queried photos of her face through a missing persons database. Nothing turned up. 

Yet, she did not appear homeless or wayward. Her hair was silky and black, the tips bleached blonde, hanging below her shoulders. Her makeup was done well, if not a little overdone, long, fake lashes making every blinking of her eyelids an event. 

"How much longer do you think it'll take before she cracks?" Miller asked between slurps from his cup.

"I'm more worried about *us* cracking, if I'm telling you the truth." Park responded, eliciting an concurring nod from his partner. 

"Whelp," Miller straightened his tie and set down his drink. "We'd better head back in there."

The pair picked up their thick file folder and made their way into the interrogation room. Jane Doe--that's what they had to call her since she claimed to "not have a name"--offered a a friendly smile upon their arrival. Park reciprocated weakly with a toothless, tucked-in-lipped upward curve of his mouth. 

"You two look tired," she observed. "I don't mind being booked, staying for the night so you can get some rest and get back at it tomorrow." 

A pang of gratitude struck Miller. If he didn't know any better--if he didn't *know* this was some kind of manipulative trap--he would've gratefully accepted, maybe even offer her a hug. 

"We're okay, but thank you for the offer," he said instead. "Now, tell me again about your theory, the whole 'pure kill' thing." 

"I thought I was pretty thorough the first few times," she said, but her excited eyes betrayed her. "Is there somewhere you want me to start?" 

"The beginning, please," Park politely asked. 

"Well, okay." Jane straightened up in her seat and brought her hands onto the table. "We all have life energy, right? Well, the energy is released when someone dies. Now, an elderly, Alzheimer-ridden man rotting away in hospice? That's bad energy. You don't want that energy. You don't want to be anywhere near that energy."

This was a new example. Miller thought to his father who was battling Alzheimer's in assisted living. He couldn't shake the idea that somehow Jane *knew* this about him; that she was getting in his head more than she already was. 

"Untimely deaths are better. Car accidents, gunshot wounds, poison. When people don't want to die, and they wouldn't except for extraordinary circumstances outside of their control, that's *good* energy. They're still holding on and there's a lot of raw energy there." Jane took a big breath in and her massive eyelashes fluttered. 

"But that's not the best. Strangers' energy doesn't resonate so much. Now," she leaned over the table, as if telling a juicy secret, "when you can make someone love you, when you can make someone trust you and *need* you, and they die..." She offered a chef's kiss. "Orgasmic." 

Park scratched his stubbly chin with the eraser of his pencil. "You speak like someone who knows; who's experienced that loss," Park observed. 

"Gain," Jane corrected. "Have you ever loved someone so much you'd kill them?" 

Miller winced at the incomprehensible thought. "I think it usually works the other way. I don't want to kill people I love. I don't think anyone does." As soon as he said it, he recognized the fault in his logic. How many men had he booked for murdering their wives, handcuffing them as they cried their crocodile tears? 

Jane shot him a dubious look. "We both know that to not be true. I'm the only one living in reality." 

Park cleared his throat. "So how many loved ones' energy have you...um... *absorbed*?"

"Oh. Hundreds. Thousands. Maybe hundreds of thousands," she shrugged. "I haven't been counting."

The detectives looked to each other, each communicating the same sentiment: *this woman is clinically insane.* 

"You don't miss any of them?" Park asked. 

"How can I miss someone who's with me all the time? Energy doesn't disappear. It *transfers.* They're in me now; a part of me forever."

"Let's back up a little bit," Miller interrupted. "Tell me about the man we found in your apartment."

"Oh. Sweet Carl," she smiled sadly. "He was a good guy." 

"Was? I thought his energy would be in you. Isn't he still...around?" Miller waved a hand in the air.

"I didn't kill him," she told the tired detective. "I would have, definitely. I was going to. But I didn't. I want to find out who did just as much as you do."
