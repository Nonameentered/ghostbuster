His eyes darted under his shades, surveying the tiny caf√© for that paparazzo who caught him three blocks ago. Did he lose him? Would he track him here? Quickly, he shrugged off his hoodie and turned it inside-out--tan to black--and he took a seat at a corner table, out of sight from the large windows. 

This sucked. He wished h could tell his past self to give up before he started, but how do you tell an eight-year old that? 16 years after his first huge debut and it cost him his childhood *and* his young adulthood. How much more will it take?

The little coffee shop was quaint; honest. A long crack climbed up the wall next to him and every outlet was protruding from the wall, metal pipes presumably connecting all the wires. It took him a few minutes to realize he'd need to go to the counter, nobody would be waiting on him hand and foot in a place like this. It was refreshing. 

He stood from his seat and approached the counter where a teenage barista juggled both the drive through and the counter by herself. She shot a quick glace his way, enough to register a warm body, but not enough to catch a glimpse of his internationally-famous face.   

"What'll it be?" She huffed out from the sink.

"Just a cup of coffee. Black. Please." He used a lower register to mask his boyish tone. 

"$2.20," she replied quickly.

He put a five on the counter and a few seconds later she slid a steaming paper cup across to him with a practiced swish. 

"Thanks," he raised the cup to her busy back. 

He turned around to head back to his seat, enjoy what little uninterrupted time he had left. On the other side of the shop was a woman bent over a computer, her hands tensely holding her beanie-covered head. She looked tired, he thought. Pale. Her hands came down on the keyboard and frantically mashed a single button as she sighed. 

He returned to his seat, now fascinated by the thin frame of a woman seated across the way. She typed oddly, one finger at a time. Her face was focused on the keys and not on the screen. She was clearly an unpracticed writer--he had seen editors and special effects folks work magic on a computer like Mozart, flourishing out a casual, effortless symphony. The woman here looked like first day in music class. 

She huffed audibly, mashing the same button as before. The backspace? That would make the most sense. He turned his attention to the thin brown liquid steaming up to his face. He could see the bottom of the cup through the coffee, bits of coffee grounds floating around in the concoction. He was used to that gourmet stuff Cleo delivered every morning. How would he stomach this? 

A sniff came from the woman's table. He looked up to see her hunched in front of the screen, a glint of a teardrop falling down her cheek. Her tragic story was unfolding bit by bit. He accidently sipped his coffee and let out a reflexive *blegh*. The barista stopped her busy movements to glare his way, The woman across the shop looked up as well, and he got a clear look at her face. Thin. Worn. Sunken eyes and pale lips. But something else...

Was she surprised? Was she angry? He couldn't tell. She had no eyebrows. The beanie made sense now too--there was no hair underneath. 

"Sorry," he told the women. "Burned my tongue." Again with the low voice. 

Both pairs of eyes returned to their tasks, neither recognizing the superstar celebrity they were sharing space with. 

A phone buzzed. Not his. Hers. She flipped it over and inspected the front. She swiped it, silencing it, and set it back down. Her hands were massaging each other and a shade of exhaustion cast over her face. 

He stood up before he realized it and his legs walked before he asked them to. 

"Excuse me," he told the woman. 

She quickly wiped away the tears from her eyes. "Yes?" 

What was he going to say? What was the plan here? "I couldn't help but notice from across the way that you seem to be having a rough time of it... Could you use some company?" 

Her face twinged, prepared to say no, but the words didn't leave her mouth. "I..." She gestured to her computer and to her phone before her hands returned to her head. Under the awning of her palms her lip began to quiver. The floodgates were opening and she didn't have the strength to keep the tears at bay.

He put his coffee down on her table and draped an arm over her quaking body. 

"Hey, hey, it's alright." For her, though, it probably wasn't, and he knew. She had that smell about her. Death. He'd smelled it on the kids he met at Make a Wish. She must be pretty far along. 

There was a word document on her screen.

*Hey. This is Tiff. Your Mom. You wouldn't know me as Mom though. Yo don't know me at all.*

He felt guilty for first recognizing she misspelled "you," but once realization set in it hit him like a ton of bricks. Were those tears at *his* eyes now? 

She turned and buried her face into his chest, gripping his inside-out hoodie and bawling into this stranger's embrace. The scene made him anxious, like some wandering eye would eventually recognize him. *Hey, that kinda looks like...* But he cleared his mind and focused on her instead. 

"Would you tell me what's going on?" He asked.

"I just want to be remembered!" She blurted out, whipping a hand at her computer. 

Sadness and grief coalesced in his chest. But there was something else niggling inside as well. 

Envy.
