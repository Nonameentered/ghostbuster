I leaned forward, cradling my chin in my hands as I squinted at the thin, blinking line on the screen. what would make a good story? What prompt might inspire a writer to craft a world I might want to explore? I clicked away from the reddit window and pulled up my tried-and-true /r/Writingprompts word bank. 

*Dark Lord...genie...isekai'd...tavern...heaven...God...superhero...*

They all felt stale on the tongue. I needed something else; something new. Something *exciting*. I took a deep breath in, sat up straight, and exhaled.

"What if," I wondered, "you could see a murder counter over everyone's heads, and one morning, your wife's counter changed from 0 to 1?" 

I hovered the cursor over the submit button before hesitating. 

This is dumb. How would that even work? What a stupid idea.

I leaned all my weight on the backspace button and cleared the title block. The thin line blinked at me again, impatiently waiting for me to come up with something new and interesting. If only *I* were interesting. I wish I could be somebody worth writing about, somebody who might find his way into some grand adventure. But what do I do? Play games; design games; argue on the internet. Not exactly novel material. 

I huffed a sardonic sigh and started typing without thinking. "You're trying to come up with a writing prompt, but you fail to come up with anything after staring at a computer for five minutes and just decide to post something really lazy." *Submit.*

I leaned back in my chair and stretched my arms behind my head. My drawn window shades had kept the sunlight from glaring off the screen and I'd completely lost track of time. Not that I had anywhere to be, but still. 

I needed a cup of coffee. Maybe two. Maybe I ought to take a break from the internet, it was making me upset too often. 

I really hoped some gifted and talented writer would comment on the thread; acknowledge the creative slump I was in. I hoped someone would understand that I was breaking this fourth wall out of a throbbing and tired angst, and not from a place of cynicism and tongue-in-cheek humor. 

Maybe they would come up with something new and interesting and creative out of the frustrated prompt I'd posted . Maybe it would turn into something magical, something *new* and *interesting* and *refresh--*

My bedroom door flew open, a purple haze filling the space beyond. It was the Dark Lord, come at last.
