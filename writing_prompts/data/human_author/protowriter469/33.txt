"It's not very sportsmanlike."

The lizard man's eyes blinked horizontally. "I'm not a ssssportsman."

"You know what I mean." The ghost looked through the kitchen window and into the living room, where a portly man was rocking aggressively in his recliner, the blue light of his TV blinking dimly on his face. 

"You haven't met him yet, have you?" The lizard's tongue slithered quickly from his mouth, smelling the air around them. 

"No, but I don't see--"

"Shh, shh, wait! Watch!" The lizard man pointed through the window.

A bright commercial cast white light on the man's form. His belly jiggled under his sleeveless TV shirt while he sipped from a can of Natural Light. 

"What am I looking at?" 

"Behind him. Look." 

The ghost's pale, dead eyes followed the lizard man's long, scaly finger to find a tall form standing still behind the man's recliner. 

"Oh shit. What the f... What is that!?" 

The lizard man was wheezing and hissing with anticipation, his clawed feet dancing in place. "Jusssst watch!" 

The thing behind the man was tall, its head wide and its eyes large and black. It was motionless as the TV shone light on its body, but rapidly moved its arms toward the man with every blink of blackness between commercials. 

Its fingers, long and sharp at their edges, reached towards the man's baseball-cap-covered head. Its mouth opened, wide and long, with rows of razor sharp teeth bared. A long pause between programming produced a period of utter darkness in the house. When light returned, the creature's hands were pressed into the plush cushion of the chair's back. 

"Ooga booga booga!" The monster shouted as it shook the seat violently. 

"What in tarnation!" The man screamed as he rose and swung his fists around. 

The creature disappeared, leaving the flailing, terrified man with a front wet with budget beer and his recliner knocked to the floor. "Communists! Nazis! Globalists!" He screamed.

The lizard man was bending over, trying his hardest quiet his laughter.  "Did you ssssee it!? Did you ssssee what he did? He's a madman!" 

"Wha--" the ghost couldn't think of what to say. Why this? Why him? 

The bushes rustled beside the peeping pair. The creature from inside stepped out. 

"Fellas," he greeted them with a smile and a nod of his huge head. Was he...an alien? 

"Outstanding work, ssssir," the lizard offered. 

The alien gave a gentile bow. "*Thankyaverehmuch*."

"Okay, rookie. Your turn," the lizard tried tapping the ghost's back, but his claw went right through. "Go steal his hat." 

The man's voice bellowed from inside. "Police? It's Jeremy...Yes, it's *me again.* Aliens were in my house again! They spilled my beer!"
