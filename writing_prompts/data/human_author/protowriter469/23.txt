Day 43: It's not my imagination. I have proof on my phone. The house is changing when I sleep. And there's something wrong with my roommate. I finally saw her in front of a mirror and her reflection didn't match. Or look human. Please, send help.

I wrote last night before I checked my camera reel. I don't know why. Maybe some part of me knew it would be upsetting. Maybe I was just tired or embarrassed. For some reason, I think I just forgot about the pictures until today.

Well, I opened my camera app and swiped through the pictures. The first was my ceiling shot. Then there were a series of blurry photos of somewhere else. It was dark and red and seemed somehow...wet? But it was big.

There were some shots of what might have been some kind of face, probably the person who took the phone. Maybe it was an elaborate prank. Maybe Angelica has some boyfriend who sleeps in and works as a graphic designer or something and he just loaded these on here.

I don't understand technology. I don't know how it works.

When I came downstairs, Angelica's door was opening. The other way. It blocked me from seeing inside.

She nodded to me and headed across the hall to the bathroom. That door opened and I caught her reflection.

It was all I could do not to shriek at the sight.

Her face was...basic? Not complete? Two black holes for eyes, stretched wrinkle-less skin across her face, patches of hair.

She saw me in the mirror and shut it quickly. She was mumbling inside, cursing under her breath.

I walked quickly to the front door, but it was gone.
