A haze had fallen on the Russian landscape, the sun a a dim disc floating in the sky. Captain Roscoe tugged at his collar, unsure if he were to cold or too warm. Maybe it was the nerves. Or, perhaps, it was this miserable Slavic climate. Why did we have to meet here? Isn't there a more temperate country we could gather in? America, for instance? 

Roscoe had been away too long. As tensions throughout the world escalated and nuclear scares became a constant threat, sending school children under their desks for the first time since the 60s, the "hot" zones required a constant presence. Roscoe was stationed at the Ukrainian-Russian border, and had been for the better part of 11 months. 

But if today goes well, he might go home. 

A whistle blew through the fog and the silhouettes of Russian ambassadors--and their competitor--stepped into view. 

"They found a big guy. What kind of sport did they think this was?" Major Bertrand nudged the Captain as pointed to the towering, steel-faced Russian approaching them. 

""It's psychological," Roscoe replied, recalling his normally-useless bachelor's in psychology. "Psychological stress makes muscles contract; stiffen. They're hoping our guy will lose his nerve." 

Bertrand exhaled a sharp scoff and crossed his arms. The smirk on his face was denial, Roscoe thought. Some people deal with stressful situations by vomiting or shaking or (in Roscoe's case) losing their ability to regulate body temperature. Bertrand was coping by denying that loss was possible. *No way we'll lose to these knuckle-draggers.*

The Russian competitor broke from his delegation and took a spot in a circle next to a Swiss referee. Lieutenant Simpson, a freshly-minted butter bar recruited from the top of his sport, entered the circle as well. 

How did it come to this, Roscoe thought. How did society crumble to thoroughly that the future of the country--no, the world--would come down to this moment. He wondered how the matches were turning out in India, Israel, China, Brazil, and Iran.

As the competitors sized each other up--the Russian towering several heads over Simpson--photographers from both American and Russian media swarmed. The referee had each man lift their right thumbs and he placed a small boxing ring over them, fitting each snugly in a hole. 

"This is so fucking dumb," Bertrand snorted. "I mean, come on. *Seriously*?" 

He was right, though he could afford to keep his commentary a little quieter. But this is what happens when negotiations stall indefinitely and every country in the world has a gun to another's head. As absurd as this outcome was, it was better than a nuclear apocalypse. 

The referee explained the rules to both men, that they can only have contact between their thumbs, there was no pushing, no spitting, no vulgar language, and no scratching.  Both contestants nodded and the referee put his hand over the ring. 

*"One, two, three, four, I declare a thumb war!"* 

Camera shutters chirped like locusts. Hearts beat in every spectator's throat. Bertrand's face went red and he looked away, the reality that loss was on the table too much for him to bear. 

*"One! Two! Three! Four!"*

The Russian threw a victorious hand in the air while Simpson, white in the face, fell to his knees. 

More Russian silhouettes approached from the fog. These ones had guns.
