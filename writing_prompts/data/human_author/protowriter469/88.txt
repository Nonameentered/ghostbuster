Is the past trauma addressed directly (e.g., "Every time I peer into the mirror, his voice echoes behind me: *You're a fat pig and no one will ever love you!* And so I set about the routine of applying lipstick to the pig, more routine than convincing fa√ßade."

Or is it indirect, like a passive voice in her head as she moves about her life? (e.g., "He looked at me from across the bar and our eyes met. I shielded my face, hoping the darkness would obscure my crooked nose and baggy eyes. I downed the neat whiskey and left my stool, fast forwarding through the evening and the inevitable disappointment I'd bring anyone I'd meet." 

If the story is about her abuse, or if it plays a significant part in the plot (something the story seeks to resolve) than I'd go with the first. However, if the character deals with this while she works accomplishing other goals in the story, I would go with the latter. Kinsey Millhouse in Sue Grafton's series of mystery novels is an excellent example of a person who struggles with a difficult past while she moves through the story.

But that's me. Good luck!
