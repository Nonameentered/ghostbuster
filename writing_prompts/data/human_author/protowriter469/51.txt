The kitchen was real busy--a conference in town bringing in all these suits and dresses ordering big ticket items and leaving little tips. It made the servers angry, and when the servers are angry, we get angry. It's a rough cycle. But a cook's gotta cook for the douche bags to serve the odd diner with decency. 

I like to think I'm good at what I do. This ain't no Applebee's--we cook here. I chop onions and tomatoes, I thicken the roux, I reduce the sauce and butcher the lamb chop. I might not've gone to a fancy school, but I can more than hold my own around here. I guess that's what makes my accident so strange. I call it an accident because I don't know what else it could've been.

I was home, burnt out from pulling a double. The Bangs I double fisted to get over my midday slump were no working against me, pulling me to my bed. I brushed my teeth first, because as rough around the edges as I might be, I know that if you don't have your dental hygiene, you don't have anything. 

There was a red mark right below my wrist, small, like a surface burn. When had that happened? It wasn't so strange to find a burn after a long shift, that's just the cost of this craft. So, I forgot about it, put it out of my mind and went to bed. 

I woke up the next morning and took a shower. It was my day off and I had errands to run. I spotted the burn again, bigger than the night before. Was I imagining something smaller now? It looked pretty brutal now, something I oughtta wrap up. I slapped some ointment and a band aid on it and called it good. 

But night after night, it kept growing, kept spreading. 

I don't have health insurance. I work at a good restaurant, but the pay is shit, the benefits non-existent. I started looking up rashes that spread and look like burns. I thought I might have eczema, cellulitis, or scabies. But I didn't itch. I didn't feel anything, even though it was halfway to my elbow by now. 

I picked up some creams, started taking some medications, and wore long-sleeve shirts. 

I was embarrassed. I didn't want it to be seen, get thrown out of the kitchen. I might be a health hazard. Who knows? But I couldn't afford to lose my job. So I kept my mouth shut and my cuffs buttoned tight. 

One night, while we were in the middle of the late dinner rush, one of our stovetops was acting up. It couldn't seem to ignite the gas coming from the burner. I'd turn the knob, *click click click*, and nothing. 

"Come on, man," I whispered to the machine, like it could hear me. "Wake up." I snapped my fingers at it, my patience getting real thin. 

A plume of flame flew out, catching the gas in the air. It wasn't dangerous, just a light show, and I was far enough away that it didn't get my eyebrows. The rest of the kitchen gave a cheer--the stove was back in service. 

But I was quiet, snapping my fingers down by the burner. With each snap, a tiny spark flew out, flashing. My skin under sleeve glowed with each snap, and I felt hot--dizzy. My arm didn't hurt, but it felt like a million pin pricks. It was almost uncomfortable, almost pleasurable.

What else could I do?
