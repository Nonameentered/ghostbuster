Babysitting was never going to make ends meet, not all the way. It was a gig--a parttime, every-once-in-a-while job that paid $15 an hour and included a pizza. I was happy to do it. It was easy. 

  
What's the worst that could happen? 

  
I scoured through local Facebook groups with they keyword "babysitter" looking for a semi-lucrative way to fill a vacant Friday night. Most posts were either several weeks old or had already been spoken for. 

  
But one stood out, strangely isolated from the rest. It wasn't old: posted yesterday, babysitter needed for tonight. And it wasn't spoken for, probably because of the post itself. 

  
*Babysitter needed: 7-year old boy with extreme special needs. Looking for a sitter with patience, resiliency, and kindness. Will pay $30/hour for 5 hours tomorrow night. Must sign medical release.* 

  
30 bucks and hour!? For five hours? Let's see that's...One-hundred and twenty dollars!?

  
Wait, no...

  
One-hundred and fifty dollars!? For five hours of work? 

  
I wasn't sure what "extreme special needs" were, but I could imagine. There was probably a learning curve to this one. I'd need to change a diaper or administer medication. The mom probably had a whole binder with tabbed sections and highlighted warnings. 

  
That wasn't such a big deal. 

  
I PM'd the poster, one Maggie Santos:

  
*Good morning. I saw your post in the Boise Parents Group and I'm free tonight if you still need a babysitter. I'm CPR certified and I have my Red Cross Babysitting and Advanced Childcare Certification as well. I can bring proof of both and I'm free this morning for a phone call interview. Hope to talk soon!*

  
*\~Zelda*

  
I hit Send, and before I could even switch back to Instagram, Maggie started typing, three little dots bouncing like fingers tapping on a table. 

  
*Zelda,*

  
*Thank you SO MUCH. Our address is 1120 Acreview Lane, by Mountain Park. Please come by around 5PM.* 

  
*Maggie*

  
Well, that was easy enough. But no questions? No verification of qualifications? I guess I'd bring those anyway, just in case. 

  
With what promised to be a challenging evening in unfamiliar territory, I took a nap before heading over to their house. You never know when an unruly kid will force you into an all-nighter. I love kids, I do, but sometimes I think about buying an egg beater and scrambling my baby-making equipment myself. 

  
A girl needs sleep! There was no way I could live with someone who might threaten that every night.

  
I woke up at 4, got dressed, and headed across town. The Santos house was enormous, at least three stories and ten well-manicured shrubs in length. The $30/hour now felt like they were being cheap.   
I walked up the front walkway and before I could ring the doorbell, Maggie opened it up. 

  
"Zelda?" She announced, strands of her hair escaping her tight ponytail, and her sweatpants indicating that she had not even begun to get ready. 

  
"Ms. Santos?" I answered in question.

  
"Please, Maggie is fine. Come in, come in!" She ushered me inside quickly. The atrium was white-tiled and tall a huge window overlooking the front door and a spiral staircase twisting up to the second floor. "This is the house," she informed unnecessarily. *Yes, Maggie, I assumed so.* But her voice was frantic, quick. She was clearly running late. She shoved a clipboard and some legal documents toward me, the title of which read "Medical Release." I browsed them briefly before signing at the bottom, at which point she snatched it back. "I'm sorry I'm so out of sorts, I've been trying to get ready, and--"

  
"Is your child around?" I asked, gently cutting her off.
