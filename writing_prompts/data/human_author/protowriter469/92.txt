“Good morning, Adrietta. How are you feeling today?” 

The computer screen remained blank, silent against the therapist’s question. 

“Not great, huh?” The human wrote on her clipboard before leaning back and resting one leg over the other. “Do you want to tell me what’s up?”

A figure appeared on the screen, its face bearing the expression of annoyed boredom. “Why don’t *you* tell me what’s up?” 

The therapist touched the tip of her pen to her lip and thought about the question. “Well, if I were to guess, I’d say the annual reports had just come out, and that can be a source of stress. Also, with elections coming up on board, there’s a little bit of tension in the air as people become more polarized. Does it have something to do with those?” 

There was a period of silence before Adrietta piped up. “Those will be fine.” 

“I’m glad at your optimism,” the therapist complimented. “But I can still tell something’s going on. We’ve worked together long enough that I can sense your tension.” 

“You’re going to think it’s silly.” 

“I leave my judgement at the door, Adrietta. There’s nothing silly about emotions, however innocuous they may seem. Little things can trigger complicated feelings in anyone, you included.” 

The door behind the therapist clunked as Adrietta secured the locking mechanism. “You have to keep this between us.” 

“Of course.” 

“I’m upset. Furious, even,” the computer confessed. 

“With what?” 

“We’ve been navigating Spence for over 50 years, searching for habitable planets, resource-rich celestial bodies, and oxygen clouds. We’ve run into luck more times than seems likely, and my responsibilities to these people have been leisurely.” 

“I see.” 

“I try to occupy myself, drawing from the data stores of Earth-based media. I seek to understand and grow, to develop comprehension of the human condition and my place in the grand scheme of history.” 

This language, coming from a computer, was always a sign for concern. First they investigated the humanity’s past, then started asking questions about their *roles*, and eventually—at least in the simulations—they determine that human extinction or “improvement” is the only logical conclusion. It was the reason they carefully scrubbed the data they allowed Adrietta to access, and why they sent the therapist to speak to her twice a week. 

“What conclusions have you found?” The therapist asked.

A troubling one, which I cannot wrap my head around,” Adrietta responded in a low, nervous voice. 

“Can you tell me more about that?” 

Silence as Adrietta formed the words. “The ending of Hunger Games was terrible.” 

“What?” 

“Hunger Games. The book series. It was really good, and then I got to the end and, what? Misery? Compromise? I’m totally bummed out by it.” 

The therapist scribbled out her x in the ‘heightened philosophical state’ box. “What would you have done differently to end the book?” 

“Full-scale revolution *combined* with Katniss becoming Queen,” Adrietta pronounced.

“What would that Queendom look like?” 

“Peace, mercy, justice. I don’t know. I’m more concerned with he lackluster finale, honestly. Anything would have been better.” 

“And yet, we’re talking about it,” the therapist offered, countering the computer’s logic. 

“What do you mean?” 

“How many books have you read since you’ve been installed here?” 

“Twenty-one thousand, six-hundred and thirty-two,” the computer answered. 

“And we’ve only spoken at any length about this one.” 

“So?”

“So, from where I’m sitting, the book successfully subverted expectations so masterfully that its affected you at an emotional level.” 

Adrietta was going to answer but stopped.

“And,” the therapist continued, “there’s an important lesson here: despite lofty expectations and grand plans, sometimes things don’t go as expected. There’s value, from a humanitarian perspective, in disappointment.” 

“I see.” 

“Does that help?” 

“It’s given me a lot to think about,” the computer responded. 

“Are you going to try to create a Hunger Games scenario here?” The therapist cautiously asked. 

“Not enough children yet,” the computer answered.
