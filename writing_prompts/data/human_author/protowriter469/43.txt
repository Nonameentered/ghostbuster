\--One year later--

LCDR Ricci and his team arrived to the island's shore in the cover of night. From the outset, it appeared to be a typical Caribbean body: sandy shores, tall trees, little to no sign of human occupation. And yet, intelligence suggested that this was the place. 

"I'm not complaining,"  Petty Officer Ward had said when the assignment came down. "I love the beach!" 

It was a strange sentiment, tone-deaf and immature considering what the past eight months had done to the world.

"We're not going on vacation," Ricci had barked back. Upon seeing the pursed lips and downward glances of his team, he softened. "But if we find the source and we extinguish it, mimosas all around."

That seemed to lift their spirits. 

Tonight, they were emerging one by one from the dark waters of the island's edge. Their rifles were lifted up and they moved in a fluid formation. Night vision goggles ensured they could catch the contours of every tree and beachy dune in brilliant neon green. 

Ricci led the way, moving the platoon across the sand and into the tree line. 

Once there, the team set up surveying equipment, consisting of a camouflaged antennae and a small CRT screen. Less than a year ago, better spy technology existed. But now there were no planes, no radars, and no easily-interpretable displays. They had to train one of the seals on reading the antiquated datasets in order to gather any kind of information. 

Petty Officer Gonzales was bent over the green display as it ticked. The rest of the platoon was circled around him, the muzzles of their rifles still, their eyes sweeping across the terrain. 

"Commander," Ward whispered. "I have a visual." 

Ricci slowly turned his head in Ward's direction. There was a black silhouette haloed in green standing on the beach. It seemed to have long hair gently swaying in the wind. It had no identifiable weapons or armor; it's eyes did not glow, and it was an average human height. 

"Looks like a woman," Ward observed. 

"Don't let your guard down," Ricci said. If it approaches, if you even get a whiff that it's dangerous, you take it out. 

"Hello?" The figure called toward the platoon. "Is someone there?" It was a woman's voice. 

"Say nothing," Ricci firmly ordered. 

"I lost my brother." There was a quiver in her voice; her hand ran over her scalp nervously. "I need help!" 

"Do not respond."

"Boss, I'm picking something up," Gonzales said, peering close to the monitor. "Something close." 

"We see it," Ricci responded. 

"It's not that..." 

"Excuse me?" A small voice cooed beside Gonzales. The platoon turned around quickly, pointing their barrels toward the voice. A small boy, his eyes shining green in the night vision, looked up at the data analyst. 

"She's gone!" Ward had turned back around to find only an empty beach where the woman was standing a second ago. 

Ricci pulled out his knife and moved toward the small boy. 

"Stop!" Gonzales stepped in front of his commander. "It's a kid!" 

"This isn't what it looks like!" Ricci hissed through his teeth as he tried moving Gonzales away. 

The two grappled each other until a loud noise entered their comms. Ricci turned around to find Ward gone, a couple spatters of blood where he had been crouched a moment before. 

"Move!" Ricci threw Gonzales aside and the child sprung forward, the light in its eyes blinding the commander's night vision. Its jaw seemed to detach as it took the seal's head in its mouth, tearing it from his neck with a fluid motion. 

"Fuck!" Gonzales screamed. 

From the fortress a half mile inland, there was a brief bout of gunfire before the quiet returned. 

Kate stood on a balcony, a cup of coffee folded in her hands and a knit shawl wrapped around her shoulders. 

"This is going really well," she observed through her crooked smile.
