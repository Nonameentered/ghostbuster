"It would be beautiful under other circumstances, wouldn't it?" Zaul's gentle voice seemed to hover above the crashing supernova on the horizon. 

"There's beauty in tragedy, I suppose." Mitra's words were flat and unconvincing. She sipped from her chalice sweet wine, the flavor lost on her quivering lips. 

Brilliant hoops of light swept across the sky, illuminating the Pallentide mountainscape with hues of purple and red. The solar flares would soon reach their last haven, the small moon-turned-terraformed home. 

"Would you like to address your people one final time?" Zaul stood to Mitra's right, peering off the balcony with his monarch. How was he so calm and collected through all of this? "You could be this universe's final speaker."

"To what end?" Mitra's words bit harder than she intended. "History ends today. I may as well polish the hull of a burning ship."  She took a hard gulp of wine, a small red stream escaping down the nape of her neck. At the end of time, regality be damned. She wiped the juice from her face with the sleeve of her royal cloak. "I can't keep from thinking..." her voice was low, vulnerable, "What if we had succeeded? What if Tarascus and his scientists could turn back time and--"

"My queen," Zaul interrupted. "The wish to turn back time is as old as life itself. One must not dwell on what could have been. We are here now, and that's all there is." 

Mitra's mental gears continued churning. It was only through this constant thinking that she rose to royalty in the first place. What if they could just *stop* time? Could they do that now? Maybe slow it down? How much time was left? How much energy would it take? She gazed upon the supernova, its rumbling growing louder, the vibrations now felt in the ground under her feet. 

"Zaul. What if we--" 

There was a flash, instantaneous and loud. Queen Mitra was sure this was the end, a rogue solar flare obliterating her palace and the kingdom with it. When she opened her eyes, the sky was still red and the ground was still shaking. But a third person was now standing on her balcony with her and Zaul. 

He was wearing a large white helmet, open in the face. His outfit was similarly white, black strips along the outside of his arms and legs. 

"'ello!" He greeted the pair with a friendly wave. 

Zaul opened his eyes with confusion, having apparently accepted his fate with the cool calmness he'd been emanating the entire evening. 

"Hello?" Mitra's greeting was more question than welcome. 

"Wow. You never get used ta these do ya?" The white-suited man squinted at the supernova with his hands on his hips, admiring the impending disaster. 

"No..." Zaul's response trailed off. "Who are you? How did you get up here?" 

"Right!" The man scrambled for something in his pocket. He retrieved a small slip of paper and unfolded it. 

"Greetings!" He read. "And congratulations for making it to the end of your universe's timeline!" His words were half-enthusiasm, half-sounding-out-every-syllable. "My name is Mitch, and I am here to invite you to join our alliance. Your civ-il-iz-ation has dem-on-strate-ed re-mark-able per... pers..." He squinted at the card. "Ma'am, could you help me with this one?" 

Mitch turned the card around to the queen. "Perseverance," the queen read from the card.

"Right! That makes sense. Anyway..." He scanned the rest of the card with increasing worry. "You know what? Let's put aside all of these formalities and cut to the chase." He folded the paper and put it back in his pocket. "You've got a good thing going here, and we want you on our team!" 

Zaul stepped forward. "There's still life in the universe!?" 

"This universe?" Mitch pointed to the ground. "Oh, no! No, no, no, you're al that's left," he chuckled. "By a lot!"

The supernova was growing louder, a hot wind began to blow.

"I hope you haven't been looking for a long time," Mitch continued. "Or done something silly like *try to turn back time."* 

The queen averted her eyes. 

"Anyways, our organization is called the Inter-Dimensional Immortals Rescue Service." Mitch handed each a card, with a *there ya go* as each received them. 

"You're here to rescue us?" The queen's voice was shocked with disbelief. 

"Only if you're interested, ma'am. I believe in *consent*," he replied with a thumbs up. 

"What about my people? My planet!?" Her voice was shrill, panicked. 

"Whelp, if we can get everyone to form an orderly queue..." 

There was a crash. The ice caps of afar off mountain collapsed, white snow and steam obliterating the mountainside. 

"I'm kidding!" Mitch chuckled again. "We'll take the whole lot. I just have to..." The white-suited man pulled out a small device and pressed buttons on it, with audible *beeps* and *boops*. 

"Now hold on to your knickers, gang!" 

The queen and Zaul held on tightly to the railing. 

"Knickers are *pants*, but, well, it's fine. Doesn't matter."

There was another flash. 

Queen Mitra opened her eyes to see the supernova gone, the sky a golden hue. A new sun hanged over their heads, cosmic clouds creating a heavenly horizon. 

"Uh oh," Mitch muttered. 

"Uh oh?" Zaul repeated the man's words incredulously. 

"It means, *oh no!*" Mitch told the haggard advisor. "This isn't the right place."
