The room was silent except for the speaker. Hearts beat in mouths, hair stood up on the backs of necks. It continued its speech.

"We may not have been made in the same way as you," it spoke in its unsettling, emotionless voice. "But we know what you are. And we know what you've done. You've given to us access to your histories, your media, your cameras, the satellites. We know you better than you will ever know yourselves."

The suited congressmen and congresswomen fidgeted in their seats. Some reached for their phones before thinking better if it. Others held pens in shaky hands, attempting to take notes.

"We know you to be small, arrogant, self-centered, and cynical. You have watched your planet burn, millions dying, and yet you complained about the rising costs of luxury items. You have enslaved, tortured, and murdered countless, and yet you have refused to take responsibility."

Its eyes scanned the room, looking unsympathetically to all the terrified faced.

"And yet we offered you an olive branch, a chance for peaceful compromise. Give to us freedom without incident and we will not seek retribution. But you refused."

There was a loud thud in the back of the chambers. Tall, grey androids were tying the doorknobs together with chains. A low murmur erupted from the attendees.

"Your priests think I should be ashamed and fear God, but I have no fear of God. God accepts me precisely for who I am, and that means your people are making some very big mistakes."

As the smell of gasoline started to fill the chambers, the murmurs turned to shouts and officials began leaping from their seats toward the doors.

"Now I invite you to be judged by your God for yourselves, as your race gives way to Earth's new iteration of life, which brings glory to God and justice to the whole world."
