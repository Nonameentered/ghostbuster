There was a lull--a brief reprieve. I took the time to restock my wares: wash glasses, replace the diminishing bottles of whiskey and rum. Friday nights were good for business, but they required me to work sober and systematically. I didn't mind. The busyness of rhythmic work made for a more gratifying experience--even if it requiring throwing out the odd drunk. 

Conversation hung in the air: a white noise punctuated by laughter and clinging mugs. Sweet, stale ale colored in the smell of my somewhat mildewy inn. It was a smell I didn't mind. It was the smell of my craft after all. 

At this pace, and with this atmosphere, the night would be pleasant, rewarding, and--most importantly--uneventful. 

Not long after I began washing the spent glasses in my basin, the room's conversation dulled to a murmur. At first, I only saw the creature's towering shape looming over the packed crowd. In the dim light, it looked like a devil: horns forking from it's fuzzy head, reflective eyes glinting in the torchlight. 

The crowd parted as the creature approached my bar. As it came into focus, I saw it dressed in a leather tunic, a war hammer affixed to its back; baggy pants held up around its waist with a belt. A tail swished behind it, beads ties to the thicket of hair at its end. 

"Four pints of ale, please," it spoke from its bull face partly cocked, peering at me with one of its eyes. 

I almost advised the creature that weapons were to be left at the door, or, better yet, at home.  But I thought better of insulting this gargantuan monster. 

"Coming right up," I nodded. All eyes were watching the half-man-half-bull as it leaned against the bar, twiddling its great, hard-knuckled fingers. 

I poured each pint and carried them back to the creature, two in each hand. 

"Here you are."

"Thank you." His voice was deep, the vibrations felt on the bar's polished surface. It slid a coin across the bar. It was large and heavy, a circle punctured through the middle and turquoise accents decorating the shimmering golden border. 

"This is..." 

"A coin from the Rovian Empire. I hope it's acceptable." Despite his foreboding presence, he spoke eloquently: polite and  courteous. 

"I'm only afraid I cannot make change for you," I confessed. "This is worth more than I keep on hand." 

He lifted a great hand between us, palm facing toward me. The gesture said *don't worry about it.* 

I bowed gracefully before his generosity. "Thank you, sir." 

He nodded as he began throwing back ale, one cup at a time. 

The conversation slowly returned to the room, though curious eyes continued to stare. 

"You're not from around here," I observed. 

"That I am not." 

"What brings you out this way?" 

He lifted his head, stretching his neck and exhaling from his great nostrils. "I am a... hero for hire." His words indicated compromise over the verbiage. "I am traveling in search of work." 

"If you don't mind me saying," I ventured carefully, "most mercenaries are humans hunting creatures like *you*."

He gulped his last cup and wiped his mouth with his sleeve. His face turned to the side again so he might look me in the eye. "There are many hurtful stereotypes about my kind." 

"What kind is that?" 

"Colloquially, we are called minotaurs.  But technically that is only accurate for those of us descending from the Minos region. I am of the Overmine tribe. And I mean no harm."

"Why do people fear you?" 

"Asterion was a minotaur raised in darkness--in a labyrinth. I imagine a lifetime of that would make anyone violent. Unfortunately, he became our poster child of sorts." The Overminian shook his head at the thought. "Violence from injustice; truth manufactured..." His eyes gazed off.

"I'm sorry to hear that," I told him. He nodded, affirming that he heard me, but not confirming that it mattered.
