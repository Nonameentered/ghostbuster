I panicked and jerked my car over a curb, the concrete scraping loudly against the undercarriage. I gripped my knife from my pocket and twisted around. The backseat was empty.

I was breathing heavy with an abnormal panic ringing in my head. Was my mystery kill a schizophrenic? Would I now struggle with that? I'd never inherited a mental disorder before, and I'd killed plenty of arguably insane people.

Or maybe I'm just tired. I took a deep breath and slowed my heart, a meditative technique I'd learned from killing a Buddhist monk. Slow breaths, in through the nose, out through the mouth.

I opened my eyes to see that my car's tire pressure warning was flashing. Jumping the curb like that must have popped one. I didn't want to be stranded out here so close to my kill, to be seen by any passing friends, family, or police patrolling the area.

I stepped out of the car to assess the damage. The front tires were shot, blown out from the impact, and the front end was several inches off the ground, lifted precariously by a bent traffic sign.

"Quite a mess."

I whipped around in the darkness to spot the source of the voice, but there were only yellow flashing street lights and quiet roads.

"Is someone there?" I called out. There was no answer. I shook the static from my head, wondering if I'd suffered a concussion from the accident.

I pulled my phone from my pocket to call a tow truck. Reflected in the black screen was a face directly over my shoulder with those same yellow eyes gazing down on me.

I turned around again, expecting there to be empty, dark space. But there wasn't. It stood over me, eyes glowing like the yellow flashing traffic lights behind it. My eyes struggled to make sense of it like I was looking at a picture with a confusing perspective. I strained at its sight and my spine chilled, pulling my face downward.

"That's better," it whispered.

My hands wrapped around the knife, but my body shook violently. I only needed one deft strike; I knew exactly how to do that. I swung the blade from my jacket pocket fiercely.

But I only swung at air. As the yellow lights flashed, I saw my hand was dark, covered with green and purple veins. I tried to pull back, but it was stuck in the air, as if it were being held.

Then I started walking, not of my own volition, but compelled. I could feel each step, every clumsy footfall and awkward sway. I was in my body, but not in control of it.

"Where?" I managed to grunt through my teeth.

I felt my own mouth articulate the response. "Let's see what you can do."
