There was something special about a good hotel bar. It was a place where disparate people came and went; a liminal space for the transient and a harbor for the nomad. It was that *timeless* quality which attracted him there so frequently. 

"A whiskey. Neat," he told the bartender.

The television was tuned to the History Channel, which was playing some junk about ancient aliens in Egypt. He scoffed. "How backwards are we that we can't believe Africans were able to build stuff without alien science?" 

"Cheers to that, mate," a younger-looking man raised his glass from the other side of the bar. He was tan-skinned, his ethnicity hard to place, and although he was a shorter gentleman, his features were strikingly handsome, giving him the air of royalty.  

"History buff?" He called down the bar.

"I have some experience," he frowned.

"Do tell." 

The young man stood from his stool and took his martini closer to his somewhat...elderly-looking...new acquaintance. 

"Your drink, sir," the bartender slid the glass tumbler of whiskey to the patron. 

He nodded and slid an old $50 bill across the table. "Keep the change, pal."

The young man watched the exchange with amusement. "High roller, are we?" 

"Let's just say... I have access to money when I need it." He chuckled softly through his greying beard before clearing his throat. "So, are you archaeologist? Professor?" 

"The truth is somewhat hard to believe." 

"Try me." 

"Pharaoh," the young man watched for the other's reaction as he swigged from his martini. 

"How's that work?"

"These days? Not at all. But once upon a time I was an emperor."

The old man took a sip of the whiskey and hissed at the burn. He squinted to the young man. "Hatshepsut?" 

He looked surprised to hear his name spoken by a stranger. To be recognized in public so many thousands of years later was certainly unexpected. "That's right. How did you know?" 

"You don't remember me, do you?" 

"I apologize. Not that I recall." 

The older man waved off his apology and took another sip. "I visited you some six months ago." 

"In England?" 

"Sorry, no. Six months ago *my* time. Several thousand years in your time."

"How is that possible?" 

The older man laughed. "*You're* one to talk, your majesty. I'm a time traveler! Gonna write a book one day." 

The younger man snapped his fingers. "I do remember you! The white man who brought me the watermelon!" 

"You got it!" 

"Did you know that I spent the next decade looking for watermelons all over the world?"

The time traveler barked with laughter and the pharaoh joined him. 

"If there's one thing I've learned in all my years of this, when time traveling, bring food to bargain with. I made off with half a million dollars in 'artifacts.'" 

"If there's one thing I've learned by being immortal," the young man said as he took a gulp from his glass, "don't accept watermelons from white people!"
