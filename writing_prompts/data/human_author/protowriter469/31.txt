A long trail of ash hanged from the tip of Detective Scarborough's cigarette. 

"Run that by me again?" He blinked hard and shook his head clear. 

Max sat up straight. "Where do you want me to begin?" 

"The beginning," the detective answered quickly. 

"Okay." Max lifted his empty mug and signaled with an apologetic smile to the waitress. "My alibi is that I wasn't on this planet at the time of the murder." 

The red-headed waitress moseyed over to their table with a steaming carafe in one hand and an empty platter in another. "You're gonna get the jitters if you keep drinking coffee like this," her voice had the croak of a long-time smoker, but Scarborough couldn't judge. He noticed the hanging ash and tapped it out on an ashtray between himself and the suspect. 

"More for you too, dear?" 

The detective raised a hand against the offer, but kept his eyes on the young man seated across from him. "That'll be all for now, ma'am," he said curtly. 

"Okay. Well, I'll be around if you need me, mmkay?" She turned and headed back to the kitchen. 

"Keep talking." 

"Right," Max continued after a long slurp from his cup. "The funny thing was--well, not funny, of course, nothing about this is particularly funny--but the *ironic thing*, if that's a better word to use, is that we'd been fighting before everything that happened *happened."*

Maybe the coffee was too much at this point. His eyes were darting back and forth, skin looking clammy. 

"I was driving on the interstate. I'd left the house after another blowup and needed to cool off. I didn't have anywhere in particular in mind. I just needed to *go*, you know?"

"Sure."

"At this point it's around 1AM, there's no one on the road, it's super dark. Suddenly, it's not dark anymore. There's a bright light in front of me, some giant...*thing* blocking the road."

"Describe the thing to me." 

"It was a tall orb on stilts holding it upright. It spanned the whole road, there was no way around it. There were two people in front of the ship--"

"Ship?"

"Yeah, that was the ship. But I didn't know it then."

"You didn't call it a ship before."

Max shrugged his shoulders. Was his story changing now, or was he giving new details?

"It was one. The two people were facing me, but I could only see their outlines. They were tall and thin; stringy bodies that were disproportionate. when they started moving..." Max shivered at the memory. "I didn't like it." 

Scarborough was leaning halfway over the table, focused on the story. He couldn't spot the lie. Everything Max was saying *seemed* to be true. 

"They took me out of my car and made me walk to the ship. It wasn't on my own volition--they were controlling my body. It was like my mind was still my mind, but my legs walked despite it." 

"Hold on," the detective interrupted. "They took you out of your car, in the middle of the interstate, and you were gone the whole night?" 

"Yes," Max answered. 

"So why were you found in your car in the morning? Why wasn't your abandoned car found on the highway?" 

"I've wondered that too," Max stared down in his cup. "I don't understand how they did it." 

His voice was curious, not defensive; tired, not scared. Detective Scarborough never needed to engage in logical he-said-she-saids with perps. He always innately *knew* when he was being told a lie. It was a gift on some days; certainly made his job easier. He rubbed the spot where his wedding ring used to be. Didn't make everything easier though. 

"Continue," the detective demanded. 

"I don't remember much about the journey. As soon as I stepped inside, everything went blank. I came to on another planet, where the grass was blue and the tree tops were purple. There were two suns in the sky and it was cold. freezing, in fact, but there was no ice."

"Blue grass, purple trees, cold weather," the detective listed off the odd details on his notebook. "Tell me about the other people there."

"Yeah," Max nodded. "Mary was one of the other humans I met there. She's from Maine, a painter, I think. Teaches art at some senior center, but her husband makes the real money." 

"Got a last name for Mary?" 

"No. We didn't get past small-talk. We were both trying to figure out where we were, how to escape. We ended up huddled together, walking over those blue hills, looking for some signs of life." 

"Are there any other identifying features about Mary? How old was she? What did she sound like?" 

"She was older. Maybe 50? Early 60s? I really don't know. She sounded like she was from Maine." Max shrugged. "Like JFK in Alabama."

"JFK in Alabama?" 

"That's what it sounded like." 

"Okay, moving on, what happened next?" 

"We found another huddle of people. Four or five--"

"Well, which is it? Four or five?" 

"I don't remember." 

"Wait," Detective Scarborough put a finger up. "Say that again. How many were there?"

"I don't remember," Max answered, annunciating every syllable. 

*It was a lie.* 

"Max, I need you to be very honest with me on this detail. How many people, *precisely*, did you run into there?"

A shivering sigh escaped his mouth. "There were six." *A truth.*

"Why would you lie about that?" 

"Look, uh... I'm not super comfortable talking about this part..."

"I don't give a shit what you're comfortable with," the detective barked back. "There's a dead body in the morgue, you're the number one suspect, and I took you out of booking to talk in private. Now tell me why you're lying!"
