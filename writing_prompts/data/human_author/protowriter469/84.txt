Grandma was in a rough way around the end. Bedridden and barely lucid, she had begun speaking nonsense to anyone who would visit her. The whole family had been gathered around her bed while she recounted some nonsensical journey she had taken thousands of years ago in some country that had never existed. The people she met and the things she did were pulled straight from her series of children's books she had published and which had built up a small family fortune. Clearly, as her brain degraded, her ability to distinguish reality from fiction did as well.

I was in that room in her last moments, standing in the back, my body shaking from withdrawals. I knew Grandma had left a will, but I didn't know if she'd left anything for me in it. I was *that* family member, who disappointed her parents, alienated herself from the rest of the family, and only popped into their lives to ask for money. I'd been trying to be better; to kick old habits, but as I watched my grandmother waste away in front of me, all I could think of was whether she would leave me any money and how much smack I could score with it. 

I hated myself. 

Her frosty blue, glazed-over eyes met mine from across the room. Once upon a time those eyes had read me stories about mischievous fairies and gallant knights. They looked into my soul and squinted their satisfaction. Now they were worlds away, but they still looked at me all the same. 

"Do forgive me, love," she whispered in her hoarse tone with only scraps of her former timbre. "and be careful what you wish for." 

Eyes of aunts and uncles and cousins briefly darted back to me, chalking up her words to final delusions aimed at one who didn't deserve even that. I folded my arms around my body and leaned in the door frame. Even after all this time, the shame still stings. And the only remedy is what caused it in the first place. 

Grandma passed shortly afterwards. There was weeping and wailing in the room before we were shuffled out. The funeral was three days later. I showed up late. High. And I was escorted out early by faceless relatives. 

A week later I was in my bedroom, tapping my foot on the ground and staring at the vanity taking up too much space in otherwise empty living room. Grandma's estate was valued at $31 million and she left me old furniture. Her last words started making sense. *Please forgive me*. 

How could I be mad at her? I'd made a mess of my life up to this point; only an idiot would leave me money. 

I tore the packing tape off the front drawer and inspected the antique piece. Maybe I could get 50 bucks at a flea market or something. It seemed in okay shape, just some paint scuffs here and there. The mirror above the desk was framed with swirling wooden patterns, plastered in a cream color to match the top of the desk beneath it. The glass itself seemed glossier than normal mirrors; deeper maybe. I'm not sure how to describe it besides that. It was different. Maybe they used to make glass differently back in the day. 

I opened the drawer hoping to find neatly packed piled of money, but there was only an envelope with my name on it. The word *Olivia* was written in Grandma's unmistakable cursive. 

I opened the flap, hoping to find the stacks of money in there, but I only found a tri-folded piece of paper with more of her writing. 

*Olivia,*

*This is the Giving Mirror. It is a magical item which has changed my life. Maybe you remember it from the stories I used to read you when you were little?*  *It is my most valuable possession, but it is also my most dangerous. Whatever I gave, it would give back. Whatever I took, it would take. This mirror can be a giver dreams or an inflictor of nightmares. How you choose to live will dictate how it exists in your life.* 

*I know things have not gone well for you these past years. I still keep your picture close to me, praying that you will find your way. The Giving Mirror can help you.* 

*Be careful what you wish for.*

*Grandma*

Apparently the dementia had started earlier than we thought.  I looked the old piece of furniture up and down again.

"Give me a pizza," I demanded, but I could only see myself in the foggy silver glass. I crumpled Grandma's letter and threw it in the corner of my room with the rest of my trash before flopping down on my mattress and falling asleep.

I woke up the next morning and started my normal routine: take a shower, brush my teeth, make myself empty promises in the bathroom mirror, put on makeup, and head to work. 

I showed up and clocked in, donning my blue vest and checking into a register. I'd had a lot of jobs in my life, some more degrading than others, but I didn't hate this one. It was simple, predictable. I made small talk with customers as they came through, tried to piece together a story about these strangers and the strange things they buy. Why would someone need cat litter, a shovel, three pounds of meat, and a roll of plastic bags? Clearly, they were lion tamers/serial killers. 

Three hours into my shift, I was pulled aside by my manager. I turned my aisle light off and followed her into her office. She showed me CCTV footage, zoomed in and grainy, of me pocketing a 20 from the register nearly three months ago. I couldn't remember doing this, but it seemed like something I would do, and you can't argue with video evidence. 

"I can pay that back," I told her sheepishly, looking down at the floor to avoid her judgmental glare. 

"I wish it were so simple," she told me apologetically. "But theft is theft. I need you to turn in your keys and your vest. Your last check will be mailed to you." 

I walked back to my apartment, trying to hold in my sobs until I got inside. The wind was cold and the sun was blocked behind low grey clouds. 

I arrived at my place and slammed the door behind me. I collapsed in the entryway, bawling my eyes out into my shaking hands. I needed a hit, just a small one. Something to take off the edge so that I could focus on getting another job, finally getting all the way clean. 

I heard something in the living room: two small taps, one heavier than the other. Had Jeremy tracked me all the way here? Was he in my living room, waiting for me to notice him? Is this how I die? 

"Hello?" I called into my dark apartment, not straying too far from the door. "Jeremy? Is that you?"

There was no answer. Slowly, I crept into to dim living room, only to find a steaming cup of cocoa and a box of tissues on the vanity. The mirror seemed to be slowly ripping, but that could have been the tears in my eyes playing tricks on me. 

 I surveyed the rest of the apartment, finding it empty. I returned to the mirror chest and sat in front of it, picking up the plain white mug of chocolate in my hands. Its heat was comfortable against my cold, shaking hands and the velvety chocolate glided down my throat, coating it in smooth, rich coziness. 

I looked at myself in the mirror, my eyes red around the green irises and the skin around my eyelids blue and grey. I looked sick and miserable and tired. I retrieved a tissue from the plain white box next to the mug and blew my nose before tossing the spent Kleenex across the room, next to grandma's letter. 

I returned to look at the mirror, but I noticed something different this time. Nothing about me, or my appearance, but something else. 

Behind me, there was door. I whipped around, only to see a blank white wall, but in the mirror's reflection, there was a black door there. 

The knob turned.
