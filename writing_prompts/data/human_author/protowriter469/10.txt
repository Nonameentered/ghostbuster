I blinked hard, taking in the situation.

I was tied to railroad tracks, old Western-style. 30 meters away, five others were tied to a parallel track. Down the line, the tracks converged, a switch with a lever beside the fork, the direction currently running toward the other five could-be victims. 

A man was approaching the switch as a barreling train approached the juncture.

"Hey!" I yelled for the man's attention. "Don't pull the..."

Before I could finish the thought, I remembered the five across from me. If the man pulled the lever, I'd die, but five would live.

The other five were screaming for the man, their voices filled with desperate panic.

"I don't know what the right thing is to do!" The man was fidgeting with anxiety, his head snapping from us to the lever to the train.

"Save us!" The five responded.

I made eye contact with the visibly terrified man at the juncture. His expression was apologetic; sad.

"Untie me!" I screamed the obvious solution here.

He shook the fuzz from his head. Right. Obviously. Untie the one guy, save everybody.

Can you imagine spending more than five minutes on this?

He rushed over and began loosing the knots on my bindings. The train grew louder, but I grew freer. I was moving, loose as the tracks rumbled by the fast-approaching engine.

As soon as the rope fell off, I leapt off the track.

... Just in time for it to roll over the other five people.
