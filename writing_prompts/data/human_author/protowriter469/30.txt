The detective's voice was louder than he intended, and the few eyes in the late night diner were wandering toward his table.

"Listen," he lowered his volume, "something about your story might exonerate you, but I have no idea what. But you're going to need to be straight with me or I'm taking you straight back to your cell."

Max swirled the last sip of coffee around the bottom of his cup, and he began looking for the waitress again.

"You've had enough of that," the detective reached over and plucked the mug from his hand.

"Sorry."

"Just continue the story. *Honestly.*"

"Okay. So, Mary and me wandered in the freezing, strange fields, trying to keep conversation to distract from the discomfort. We stumbled upon a group of six people huddled under a tree." Max sighed hard. "Around them were, uh... Limbs."

Another new detail. "What do you mean limbs?"

"Arms. Legs. Hands. Just cut clean off of people and arranged around them. There wasn't blood. They might've been frozen solid. I have no idea. The huddle of people seemed scared of us. One of them jumped up and started speaking some language I didn't know. He jumped up and ran toward me, so I pushed him."

"What happened next?"

Max was eyeing his mug in Scarborough's hand. "I feel like I'd need a lawyer to continue," he said sheepishly.

The detective thought it was a joke, but didn't pick up on any lie. "A lawyer? Why?"

"Hypothetically, if I committed a crime, I'd be confessing it if I told you, right?"

Thankfully, Max couldn't detect lies like Scarborough.

"Does any part of this feel like it's official to you? I'm not recording." He was. "And I wouldn't take you here if I thought you were guilty of a crime." He would. "I'm not here to press charges on you. I'm here to find out the truth."

Max had a mousy face, and it squinted and contorted as he reasoned on those points. "Okay, but I'll deny it if you tell anyone."

"Fine."

"I pushed the guy and he shattered."

"Shattered?"

"Like a piece of glass. Just..." Max made a crashing noise."

"Then what happened?"

"The rest of the people in the huddle didn't react at all. They just sat there, hiding their faces from us. Things started to blur and I was behind the wheel of my car again, in the driveway of her house."

This should have been an open-and-shut case. 99% of the time, when a woman gets killed, its her boyfriend or husband. This alibi was laughable--beyong laughable--offensive. And yet... There was no lie in it.

Sometimes people misremember things; they hallucinate or they're convinced of a different truth. Detective Scarborough remembered when the VA tried to deny his disability. "Remember when you joined you said you had breathing problems?" He almost bought it too.

But this... thing that the detective could do, the ability to tell truths from lies, it could see through that somehow. He tended to catch manipulated and damaged memories, and he could spot mental illness a mile away.

Max, despite being a coward and a caffeine addict, was not crazy. He believed he'd been off the planet. He'd had an extraordinary experience that could exonerate him.

But then, who killed his girlfriend? And where was Max during the murder.

The waitress came back with the carafe unprompted.

"Here's more coffee," she announced flatly.

Scarborough looked up at the woman, whose previously friendly face was flat with something else. Anger? Pain?

Fear?

"Everything okay?" The detective asked.

"Yes."

*It was a lie.*
