He stood up and took an electric hotplate from a drawer and set a kettle on top. "What do you think of homosexuals?" 

Considering the part of the county I was in and the good-old-boy d√©cor, I was afraid to answer honestly. "I don't have an opinions," I told him. I certainly couldn't tell him I was one. 

The kettle shook as it heated up and Oggy moved around the room, preparing a couple cups and scooping leaves from a tin.

"Do you think love is the greatest power of them all?" He asked, looking up at his water-damaged drop ceiling. 

I laughed awkwardly. "I don't know."

"Or, perhaps," he continued, "is it violence?"    

"I opened my mouth to tell him I didn't know, but I reconsidered. "It depends on what you think 'greatness' is."

He turned and smiled to me. Apparently the question was the right answer.

"Are you a Christian?" 

"I'm not."

"Are you left-handed?"

"Yes."

"Your father, do you hate him?" 

"I don't know." 

"Do you hate yourself?" 

"...yes." 

The kettle whistled and poured the hot water into each mug. He passed me one, a faded "NASCAR Winston Cup 1997" picture on it. "Drink this," he told me. 

The water was brownish-grey, loose leaves floating around it. 

"What is it?" 

He didn't answer, but only sipped from his own cup as he sat back down.

The drink was sweet and strangely fizzy. I couldn't spot which fruit it reminded me of, but it was pungent and somewhat grotesque, like what I imagine a barrel of rotting fruits might taste like. 

I grimaced at my mug. 

"Do you dance?" 

"I can, but I don't."

"Would you wish death on a dog that hurt a person?"

"No."

"Would you wish death on a person who hurt a dog?" 

I laughed. "Yes," I admitted. 

He slapped his knees and stood back up. "Alrighty. Have a seat."  

"Oh." I sat my cup down and stood up. I guess the Q & A was over. 

I sat in the barber's chair, which creaked under my weight. "So," I began to explain, but he put a hand up, signaling for me not give him instructions. 

"A gay man estranged from his family and his faith struggles to love himself and others, and yet shows compassion for the innocent. He does not express himself publicly because his upbringing has showed him it is not safe. He seeks truth now and for the world to see his truth, and so he finds his way into my chair." 

There was nothing I could say to that, so I kept my mouth tightly shut. He looked at me in the mirror. "You will be beautiful," he said, serious and solemn behind his red beard.   
I couldn't keep track of his movements, and at some points he seemed to be in two places at once. His slow, lumbering frame moved fluidly across his shop, retrieving vials and spray bottles, clippers and colors. My head was moved up and down, his rough hands pivoting me from my chin and my temples. 

And then, just as suddenly as he began, he stopped. "Okay," he grunted. "You're done."   
I looked into the mirror. My hair was...bigger. Longer? Colored red and blue, framing my long face with a tall flourish on top that looked equal parts intentional and careless.   
I looked, for the first time...right. 

"What do I owe you?" I asked. 

Once again, his hand raised up, cutting me off. "I'm closed now. Thanks for coming in." He gestured to the door, no longer in the mood for discussions.

I left, not paying, the bells jingling behind me. There was a tap against the door, and I saw the Open sign now marked Closed, rocking gently from having just been turned. 

In the glass of the door, I saw my reflection. 

I looked good.
