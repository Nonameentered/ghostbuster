\--------Mr. Montgomery, the mark--------

I paced in the dank and dingy apartment, waiting for the phone call. I was surprised the company maintained such a shitty place, but I suppose if *I* were a hitman looking for the one surviving keeper of the company's secrets, I would be browsing luxury flats and mega yachts. 

I sighed and turned the little flip phone in my hands. *Only use it for emergencies. Do NOT call the police.* Those were the instructions. I walked back and forth in the dim living room, wondering what some corporate body guard could do that the police couldn't. Probably murder. Well, the police can do murder. they're not supposed to though. 

There were three knocks in the hallway. The sounds caused me to flinch, nearly dropping the phone on the hardwood floor. I listened intently to the voices outside. 

"It's your neighbor from downstairs. I've got water leaking through my ceiling." 

I peered through the peephole to see a hooded figure slouched in front of my neighbor's door. The numbers were askew, his "6" flipped down to a "9." I was tempted to check what apartment I was in--I couldn't remember--but I was petrified of what could happen if I announced my presence. 

The door across the hall opened slowly, and the hooded figure reached in and out in less than a second before pulling the door closed. On the floor, as he walked away, was a drip of red.

My heart beat in my throat. What did I just witness? An assault? *A murder?* Anxiously, I flipped my phone open and closed, debating whether or not I should report this. It was probably nothing, I assured myself. Probably some neighborly prank. Though I didn't hear any laughing. 

As quickly as he arrived, the hooded man descended the stairs. I rushed to the window, where I watched him skulk quickly away and around the corner. 

I should check on the neighbor, I thought. I should make sure everything's okay. Slowly, I turned the knob of my front door and pushed it open, tip-toeing across the hall. I knocked on apartment 409--er, 406--and called in, "Hey there, is everything okay? I heard there was flooding?" 

I heard no answer.

"I'm, uh... I'm coming in," I called quietly as I pushed open the door. 

Before me was a body, splayed awkwardly in an expanding pool of blood. I stood in shock, unable to react. Then, I saw the rest of the apartment. 

The walls looked like they had been scorched from the bottom up, long black streaks of ash and damage on top of ruined drywall. The floor was caked in dirt, and the smell of shit filled my nostrils. A flickering light danced from the living room, drawing me in like a moth to a flame. 

I stepped over the lightly convulsing body and looked into the flickering light. In the middle of the room, surrounded by broken, splintered furniture, was a hole in the floor, opening to a cavernous, red space. I felt the urge to jump in, to dive into the abyss that laid before my feet. 

My tip-toes hung off the edge, and I watched creatures swarm and pulse as light glinted off their slimy bodies. A face looked at me, glowing yellow eyes meeting mine. It reached for me with a long, black hand, sharp edges at its fingertips. I leaned forward. 

"What are you doing!?" A voice shouted behind but it sounded distant, faint. 

I was pulled violently back, tossed across the room. A tall man in a white suit held his hand over the hole in the floor. A white light emerged from his palm and flashed away, until the hole was gone. 

My head cleared, like I was waking up from a dream. A nightmare. The white-suited man adjusted his tie as he turned to look down on me. 

"Are you from the company?" I asked. 

"What?" His head cocked to the side. 

"Are you the...uhm...emergency response?" 

"No," he said bluntly. "Who are you and what were you doing here?" 

I stuttered over my explanation, how I watched someone kill the tenant and came here to investigate before seeing what I saw. 

"Listen," he said, raising a large palm to me, "forget what you saw here. Go back about your business." 

I was about to respond until I heard a stomping coming from the hallway, ascending the stairs. It caught the white-suited man's attention too.
