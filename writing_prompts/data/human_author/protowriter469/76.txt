The bag was pulled off my head and the bright lights stung at my eyes. I didn't know where I was, how I got there, or why. The last thing I remembered, I was hailing a taxicab after dinner, ready to get home, pour a glass of wine, a disassociate for several hours on my phone. So much for my romantic evening plans. 

A dark, foreboding figure stood in front of me, his shape a fuzz in my adjusting vision. 

"Hello?" I asked, squinting at his frame. 

As soon as he started speaking, I recognized the voice. "Good morning, Denise. Welcome to my lair," Lord Chaos announced in his deep, breathy voice.

Was it already morning? How long had I been out for? 

"Good morning," I replied, lost for words. "What am I doing here?" 

"You are my bait, of course," he half-chuckled in his sinister, cynical jubilation. 

I struggled in my seat, finding myself constricted by tight ropes around my middle and my shoulders. He had avoided my chest, thankfully. As uncomfortable as this was, I couldn't imagine how much worse it would be if my tits were squeezed for 12-plus hours. 

"These are great knots," I observed out loud. "I was in the girl scouts once--a long time ago, of course--and I could never tie a knot. Not to save my life."

"Uh. Thanks," he replied awkwardly. "I take pride in my work." 

"It totally shows." 

He turned around and tended to a panel of blinking lights and odd machinery. 

"Do you have any food?" I asked him as my stomach rumbled. 

His hand rose and hesitated, not expecting this sort of question. He expected me to cry, of course. To beg. To weep for Captain Neptune to come save me.  I wouldn't give this sociopath the satisfaction. I was going to be the most perfect, polite, and professional *guest* he could wish for. 

"Are you hungry...now?" He asked.

"I am. I'll be honest, I didn't eat much last night and it's catching up to me now. I hate to interrupt your work, but I'm starving."

He turned around and inspected me with suspicion. I returned a crooked, apologetic half-smile. *I really hate to be a pain.*

"Sure," he nodded as he strode across his lab and opened a fridge. "I'm afraid I don't have a lot. Very busy these days."

"Oh, I know. I don't mean to swoon, but I'm kind of a fan." I squeaked a nervous giggle that would make me retch for the rest of my life every time I remembered it. 

"Really?" His face, a long, sharp, goatee'd thing, peered up from his refrigerator door. 

"I mean, yeah," I told him as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. "This si sort of a dream come true for me." 

He smiled, but not with that sinister curl that caused his mustache to inexplicably flex. It was sweet. Sincere. I was making progress.

"I have some eggs," he said, holding up a carton. "I've been sort of on this keto thing lately--no grains and all that--but I can whip a couple of these up if you want." 

"I hate to put you out," I cocked my head and bent my eyebrows with embarrassment.

"It's nothing!" He said quickly before clearing his throat and straightening up. "What good is a hostage if she's starved to death?"

I conjured a fangirl giggle, half excitement, half curious arousal. All fake. What is it about laughing girls that makes men's brains short circuit like this? I swear, if I were a supervillain, I would just curl my blonde locks, bite my lip, laugh a little, and rule the world. Idiot, the lot of them. 

"Scrambled? Over easy?" Lord Chaos asked from behind me. 

"How do *you* like your eggs?" I asked him. 

"Boiled," he answered. Of course he liked them boiled. I can just imagine him popping whole eggs into his gross mouth and chewing them for all the world to see. 

"When in Rome," I called in a sing-song voice. I heard him laugh a little bit under his breath. 

The whole time, I'd been shimmying, loosing the ropes that bound me. Truthfully, it *wasn't* a good knot. I was an amazing girl scout. I knew all the tricks. And I sold a hundred boxes of thin mints every year, *motherfucker.* 

I heard the stove click on and Lord Chaos strolled into my vision, a newfound pep in his step. 

"I'm going to send a picture of you to Captain Neptune," he told me, holding up his cell phone.

"Now?" I asked, disappointed. 

That caught him off guard and he lowered the phone. "What do you mean?" 

"Can't we have breakfast first? It's been a *long* time since I had breakfast with a man." 

"Oh. Um. Yeah, sure. It'll be a little bit on the eggs though. Is that okay?" 

"The longer the better," I told him with a wink. IT was so corny I almost heard the *ding* of my eyelid shutting. 

His face blushed and he rushed to tend to the stove. 

While he was turned around, I loosened the slipknot and the ropes fell beside me. I tiptoe across his lab and grabbed a wrench off the floor. 

"You know, boiled eggs are amazing with just a little bit of tabas--" he started, stopping suddenly as the wrench met his head. 

He dropped on the ground, splayed like some kind of squishy action figure. I turned off the stove--fire safety is important--and wandered out of the fortress, which was, to my surprise, just a few blocks from my flat. 

A week later, I received a letter in the mail. 

*"Denise,*

*This is Lord Chaos, the scourge of the tri-city region and your most recent captor.* 

*I feel like we got off on the wrong foot. I enjoyed having you over the other evening, and I would very much like to do it again. I can make eggs any way you like. I can take a break from keto. I felt like there was some chemistry; like we're kindred spirits. Think about it. Write me back.* 

*- Lord Chaos."*
