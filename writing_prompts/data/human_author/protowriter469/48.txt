Is this the place? An old, run-down storefront in a dying village? The shop's fa√ßade was a cracked, off-white stucco; years of dirt and grime collected on the long-ago painted door's front. The sidewalk was unkempt, weeds and spalls making the surface uneven--in some parts, precarious. 

Yet, there was that quintessential barbershop candy cane hanging over the window, a sign that read "open" behind the glass. 

I took a deep breath in. Something about decaying towns made me anxious. People stuck around these parts like stubborn passengers on a sinking ship. Their pride and optimism were transparently denial--they would die here waiting for fortune to find them, only for fortune to have set up shop far away and long ago. The wise had followed it, the foolish remained. 

Well, that's pretty cynical, I told myself. I don't need to keep expositing on America's decaying rural Midwest. I need a haircut.    

I pushed the barbershop door open. Bells jingled above me, announcing my arrival. 

It was a small, one-room shop. A couple old pleather chairs were lined against one wall underneath Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Sr. posters. A Bass Pro shop clock ticked loudly on one wall. There was an ancient, yellowing air conditioner in a high-up window quietly humming and rattling, ribbons shaking in its wind. 

"Morning," a gruff voice sniffed from the barber chair. I hardly noticed him at first, he so seamlessly blended in to the background. 

The bearded man stood up, wearing denim overalls, a t-shirt blotted with paint, and an American flag pin on his chest pocket. On his head was a shock of dark red hair, greying on the sides. His beard was neatly cropped, sprigs of white among the red whiskers. "Here for a haircut?"

I nodded. "Um, yeah. I heard you were the guy to see..."

He didn't make eye contact, but began gathering tools and odds and ends from the various drawers of dilapidated furniture propped up by old paperbacks. He set his equipment on a tray and gestured to one of the old seats. "Sit."

I lowered myself into one of the chairs. The man pulled the other around so it was facing me. "Do you mind if I smoke?" He asked as he packed a pipe with tobacco. 

I shrugged. "Your business." I was pretty sure it was illegal to smoke indoors, but I couldn't imagine the health department made it a priority in a place like this. Most residents were probably getting lead poisoning from the water anyway.

He lit a match and lowered it into the pipe's bowl. Soon, he was puffing clouds of thick, rich tobacco. but there was something else in the smell too: a minty, tingly sensation that caused the hairs on my head and arms to stand up straight. It was not unpleasant in the slightest. 

"Now," he began, looking at my head and my face, "what is it you're looking for?"

"Well," I touched the hair on my head, "I've got a strange face shape; I've never been able to find a good cut that--"

He dismissed what I was saying with a wave of his hand, the force clearing away some of the haze between us. "No. What are you *looking for*?"

I wasn't sure how to answer. "I want to be approachable...fashionable."

He shook his head and leaned forward. "Are you a virgin?"

Suddenly I didn't feel so comfortable in this shop in the middle of nowhere. "What?" I chuckled anxiously. 

"Have you made love? Found someone to share your most intimate self with?" 

I snorted. "I've had sex!" 

His eyes squinted as he pulled from his pipe. "Insecurity," he whispered, the smoke escaping with his words. "Not a good look."

I was feeling defensive. "I'm sorry, is this the barbershop? Who are you?"

"You're in the right place," he nodded. "My name's Oggy." He gestured forward for me to introduce myself. 

"Myers," I answered the unasked question. 

"Myers," he sampled the name in his mouth between puffs from his pipe. "How's your relationship with your mother?" 

I puffed up my cheeks, unsure how to answer the question. "Fine," I shrugged.
