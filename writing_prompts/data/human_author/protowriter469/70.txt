Dried stalks of ruined corn crackled against the thrusters' blast. The ship's descent blew dust into the hazy red sky, battering the ruined crops and swirling particulate into the air. Metal legs extended to the earth, setting the spherical ship gently down before the engines quieted and the vessel settled on the ruined planet.

A hole opened on ship's hull, like a liquid parting in an oval shape. A bridge extended from the sphere and landed on the ground, crushing a surviving green sapling and sending a plume of red dirt in its wake.

"I imagined it would be different," the emissary frowned.

"Different how?" her assistant responded.

The emissary stepped out onto the bridge, one large blue foot at a time. Her golden cloak dragged behind her over the bridges smooth, silver surface; her many rings and necklaces jingled with every step, a cadence of royalty as she surveyed the landscape.

"Different like... I don't know... More buildings," the emissary shrugged.

"There's a building," her assistant pointed toward a half-collapsed barn, the corpses of cows dotting the perimeter.

The emissary opened her mouth to criticize the dreary architecture, but she stopped herself. Who was she to judge, especially at a time like now, in a place like this? She cleared her throat. "Indeed. Let's investigate."

The assistant looked over the bridge at the sharp, bent stalks of corn. "We should have landed closer."

"Less talking, more holding my cloak," ordered the emissary as she marched forward. The assistant rushed behind her, lifting the tail of her golden cloak off the ground and holding it upright.

Three steps onto the strange planet's surface and the emissary knew her assistant was right. This planet is uncomfortable. Perhaps it was that discomfort which conditioned them to be such valiant warriors. What would their rule mean for the galaxy? Would we all be expected to adopt such conditions? And what of the emissary's palace? Would it look like this gaunt display they were approaching? She hoped not.

The pair walked through the field in a gait distinguished at first, but painstakingly lunging by the time they reached a clearing. The sharp stalks had poked and prodded at their clothes and skin, leaving deep blue scratches and loose threads in their wake.

The emissary fixed her crimson hair, which was tied up in a neat, towering beehive above her head. The assistant's hair frizzled out wildly, but she didn't care much. She was the cloak-holder, not the hair-carer.

"Okay," the emissary sighed after patting down her outfit and ensuring her ensemble was tidy enough for a meeting with the planet's residents. "Let's go."

The assistant followed obediently, shaking dried grass from her legs clumsily as she moved.

They stopped at a dead cow, its mouth open and its tongue sprawled on the ground.

"Gross," the assistant observed.

"Don't be rude. We know nothing of their culture. It might be...a peace offering."

The assistant's face crumbled with disapproval. "I hope not."

The emissary hummed with agreement.

The barn door creaked open, sending red light into the dark space. Snapped planks of wood shot out of the crumbled side like sharpened spears.

"How very... different," the emissary offered, for lack of a more honest word.

The assistant had a bad feeling about the space. It was too dark; too oppressive. She feared meeting whatever creature would call a place like this home. Back on Keladar-Z, the plants were soft and fragrant, the buildings cut from stone and chiseled into fine, flowing designs. The suns shone brightly under a blue sky, and animals grazed in rolling hills. This was a hellscape. And so itchy!

"Hello?" The emissary called into the space. "I am from Keladar-Z, the capitol of the Galaxy. We are looking for the leader of this planet." 

There was a rustling inside, and the pair recoiled slightly, small steps back toward the door. Suddenly, a light shone on them, illuminating the space with a white beam. The assistant threw the cloak tail over her head and shielded her face from what must have been a death beam. 

A stone whizzed through the air and impacted against the emissary's chest with a soft thud before dropping to the floor. Curious, she leaned down and picked it up, turning the strange rock in her hands. 

"Thank you for this gift," she said as she bowed. 

A head popped up from behind a frightening machine's silhouette. 

"Who are you!?" it called out. 

"Hello," the emissary said, instantly chiding herself as she remembered she had already said it once before. "I am Selestia, emissary for the planet Keladar-Z." She had also said that as well, hadn't she? "Are you the ruler of this land?" 

There was a silence in the space for a moment before the voice piped up. "This is my farm!" it called out. 

So, they farm planets. It made sense why this planet was so barren: they farm worlds and send resources back to some home planet, perhaps in a different galaxy. What sort of empire were they building?

"We are here to offer you fealty, O great conqueror of the Rastor Regime." The emissary and her assistant genuflected, but kept their knees from touching the filthy surface of the planet. 

The figure moved out from behind the machine to see two tall figures bowing, one with the other's clothes over its head. The light moved from one to the other, up and down their towering gold forms. 

"Are you good guys?" The creature asked. 

The assistant looked out from Selestia's cloak and looked her boss in her eyes. *Good guys*? 

"We are...not guys," Selestia explained. "But we are good!" She added brightly. 

"Are you here to hurt me?" The creature asked. 

The pair looked to each other again. "Wha-no, of course not! You are a great conqueror. You have destroyed the forces of the Rastor Regime. You have liberated the galaxy. We are here to offer you the office of Galactic overseer, great warrior." 

The light beam flipped off and the assistant sheepishly removed the cloak from over her head. 

The creature was small. Very small. Much smaller than they would have expected. But, then again, razor snoots, one of their planet's many forms of wildlife, were also small, and they were vicious. So, maybe it wasn't fair to judge a being on its height alone. 

"You don't *look* like the bad guys," the creature observed as it walked closer. 

"We are not guys...." the assistant spoke, only to be quickly shushed by her boss. 

"Is it just you two?" It asked. 

The emissary wondered if the creature was gathering tactical information, wondering about reinforcements, traps, weapons. "We are linked with the homeworld, and if anything should happen to us, they would dispatch a defensive force," the emissary explained, thinking back to the slaughtered animals outside and shuttering. 

"I don't think the bad guys are here anymore," the creature cooed. "You should be safe." 

A wave of relief washed over the pair. 

"O conqueror, ruler of this land, what shall we call you?" 

The creature walked closer, into the red light so that the visitors could see it more clearly. It was quite small, with black hair tied back into a tail of sorts. Its hands were small; its clothes some cloth variety. It had large, brown eyes and creamy tan skin. Selestia's heart skipped a beat. *This monster was adorable.*

"I'm Jaime," she nodded as she extended a little hand outward.
