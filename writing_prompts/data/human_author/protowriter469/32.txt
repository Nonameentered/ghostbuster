Every five years at the beginning of Spring  
Mary Bukowski begins a new fling.  
A divorce in the summer, engagement in fall,  
A wedding in wintery white Montreal.

The first invitations were flowery with lace,  
Calligraphy carefully curling with grace.  
It detailed the occasion; the date it was on,  
Signed Mr. and Mrs. Bukowski-St. John. 

The next round of invites five years from that day  
Were delivered by singers (how very clich√©).  
They harmonized the announcement and concluded with style,  
From the newlyweds Bukowski-St. John-Carlyle 

Ten years from the first, another arrived,  
A box five feet tall and three feet wide.  
Unpacked it revealed a hundred balloons,  
of various sizes and style and hues.

Each one, when popped, revealed small sheets of scrap,  
Assembled (painstakingly), forming a map.  
I followed the map to the edge of the town  
To a telephone booth, with no one around.

I picked up the receiver and listened with care  
To the strange sounds of breathing and white noise of air.  
"What are you doing, the fifth day in December?"   
"Nothing I know of," I replied to the sender.

"In that case," they chuckled, and then cleared their throat,  
You're invited to celebrate a wedding! Take note!  
And whose was the wedding? I'm sure that you know.  
Mrs. Bukowski-St. John-Carlyle-Theroux.
