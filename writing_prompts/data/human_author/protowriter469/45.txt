"This is Chris Roberds, reporting from Channel 7 News..."

Crowds of reporters, emergency services, and panicked businesspeople clamored around the scene.

"What transpired here this morning is confounding city officials. The state department, as well as the Pentagon, has declined to offer a statement. This is what we know: At approximately 5:45AM this morning, there was a bright flash in downtown Manhattan. A square mile, roughly, vanished, leaving behind a dense forest."

The camera focused behind the reporter. Police had formed a wall of guardsmen and police tape around the towering Birch and Maple trees. Through the trunks and brush, the forest was dark, the treetops blocking out all except stray beams of sunlight, revealing hints of a strange, untamed interior. 

"Most residents we've spoken to have expressed confusion and fear. Many have evacuated the city in case the phenomenon repeats itself. But those who have stayed behind have had one primary question: where are my loved ones?"

Shouting erupted, drawing the cameraman's attention. Someone had broken through the police line, rushing toward the trees. A cacophony of cheers and barking commands rose all at one. The popping sound of gunfire caused the crowd to drop before stampeding away from the line. 

"Wait! Watch out!" Chris grunted while the microphone picked up the scuffing sounds of footfalls and stomping. The camera fell to the street, broadcasting the wild panic of rushing protestors stomping on top of one another. 

Then there was a loud noise, like a low horn. More screams filled the air and the rushing intensified.

Dominique stood in the middle of the street, gripping her black leather briefcase under one arm and holding her cup of coffee in the other. Her eyes struggled to register what she was looking at. Had she taken her meds this morning? Of course she had. She hadn't forgotten in years. But then, how could she be seeing this otherwise?

"What is that?" A voice whispered behind her. 

Dominique turned around to see an elderly woman in a cardigan with her arms folded tightly across her chest. 

"I'm sorry to ask you this," Dominique started, "but are you real?" 

The woman cocked her head. "Yes, dear. Are you alright?"

She switched the cup of coffee to her other hand and reached out, touching the knitted cardigan. The older woman met her hand with hers in a sign of comfort. Dominique let out a sigh of relief before they both looked back at the end of the street. 

A wall of forest greeted them, the sounds of chittering creatures and whispering leaves swaying in the wind replacing the beeping horns and ambient conversations. 

"I have no signal!" A man shouted as he stepped out of a taxi. He held his phone up in the air while squinting at the screen. 

Shop owners shuffled out of their storefronts, looking around at the scene. There was something terrifyingly quiet about the city now. Dominique heard the words "no power" from a passing voice. Then she heard a shout: "Where's the tower!?" 

Sure enough, One World Trade Center was missing from the skyline. 

"Are you sure you're alright, dear?" The elderly woman tapped Dominque's hand, now gripping the threads of the cardigan.     

"I, uhm..." her coffee was shaking in her trembling hand. "Is this real?"
