It was the eyes, Heather decided. Human eyes don't just stay still like that. They dart around, focus on things. The newscaster's eyes just...stared, like it was wearing a convincing Halloween mask. But not convincing enough. 

"The Metro Seattle area was terrorized by a stabbing spree that took place outside the Jupiter Bar on 2nd Avenue around 1AM. Local authorities attribute the rise in crime with the rise in poverty due to the growth in automation affecting most large local industries."

The news was white noise in the background. Another stabbing, shooting, kidnapping, arson...it was par for the course at this point. Unemployment was at a staggering 52% and growing as corporations moved away from human labor. At least Heather's job at the hospital was secure. Robots might be able to empty bedpans, but they can't deliver babies...yet. 

"Leading economists disagree with this premise. The rise of crime, according to *qualified* professionals, is due to drop in personal responsibility and financial planning. Automation has kept the country competitive on the world stage since its wide adoption six years ago. 12 were killed and 31 injured." The computer-generated newscaster's expression was unchanged, the same flat, semi-focused, barely sympathetic face she'd had all evening. 

"In other news, eco-terrorists have entered their 10th week blocking freight trains from leaving the Amazon/Nestle warehouse district, and have hindered the company's ability to provide critical resources to local communities. A small-town local had this to say:"

The image switched to an older man with white hair and a baseball cap on his head. "It's difficult to put food on the table when eco-terrorists block it from arriving. How am I supposed to feed my family?" His head turned at a noise. 

But his *eye*. They didn't move. 

Heather blinked and paused the TV. Hold on. Rewind.

"How am I supposed to feed my family?" *Noise. Head turn.* Heather looked at the ribbon on the bottom of the screen. Where a name belongs were only the words "Small-town local." 

That is...strange. 

News media companies were required several years ago to transition from biased, human-led reporting to procedurally generated, AI-powered newscasting. Without the agendas of humans, there was supposed to be greater transparency, equality of messaging, and less chance of radicalization. 

But this was...well, Heather couldn't figure out what this was.
