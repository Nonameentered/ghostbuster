My senses came back one by one, starting with my hearing. There was a low hum of air conditioning, ambient conversations somewhere far off. Steady beeps nearby gave me a sense of time--something I could track while I couldn't see of feel. 

Where was I? What was going on?

I searched my mind for the last thing I could remember. There had been breakfast that morning, a big one in fact. Many people showed up, their glasses raised to me. I couldn't quite remember their words, but they were happy; congratulatory. 

Omar was there, patting me on the back. "This is going to be big," he'd said through his mustachioed lips. 

"How's everything going in here?" There was a woman's voice in the room with me now. I tried to open my mouth, let my questions spill out. *Who are you? Where am I? What do you want!?*

"More of the same," another woman answered quietly. As my feeling began to return, I could feel her holding my hand tightly. Her skin was cold and her fingers were delicate. Who could this be? She was too young to be my mother, to kind to be Maria. 

"His anesthesia should be wearing off soon," one of the women told the other. 

"Do you know how soon?" The one holding my hand asked eagerly. 

"Within the next hour. But the police have called, and they're going to want to question your husband soon after he wakes up."

Anesthesia? Husband? Police? They have me mistaken for someone else. My brain raced around the possibilities: I'd been in a terrible accident--maybe a fire--and my face was gone. Someone was conning me, stealing my money while I was unconscious and framing me for murder. I'd died and was put into the cryochamber and now it's the distant future.

I was panicking, the beeps on the monitor speeding up. *Beep...beep...beepbeepbeepbeep*

"What's going on?" The woman holding my hand sounded frazzled, her grip around my fingers tightened. 

There was a pause while the other woman--a doctor, I presumed--checked out my EKG. "It's nothing serious, just a slightly increased heartrate. It's possible he can hear us right now."

"Andrew?" Her voice was close now, loud as she called my name into my ear. 

"Andrew." I was remembering Omar again, but somewhere else now. "Remember, you go out, signal when you're ready, and I'll reel you back in." He was speaking through some kind of headset while I was sitting in a chamber. 

"Do you want me to pick something up for you? Pack of cigarettes?"

"See if they have the Shamrock Shake at Micky D's. Bring me back a couple of those if you have the time." We both chuckled. 

"Can you hear me?" It was the woman's voice. "Give me some kind of signal if you can hear me. Please." She was begging, desperate and terrified. "Please come back to me." 

I squeezed her hand in mine and she gasped. "He squeezed my hand! HE SQUEEZED MY HAND!" Her words were punctuated with laughter and sniffles. 

"That's wonderful!" The doctor told her. "He should be coming to any minute now, but make sure you don't jostle him too much. His body is still very fragile. 

The woman didn't answer the doctor, but buried her face in my shoulder, smelling me and crying. 

"Dr. Kreese, the countdown will begin in just a moment," I heard through my earpiece while I sat in the chamber. I was in a suit with a mask, an oxygen tank on my back. *There might be viruses out there that you are not immunized for. It's critical you complete field study before breathing without protection.* It was one of many warnings that were coming back to me. *Avoid authorities, and do NOT let your tether be confiscated or destroyed.* 

My tether? Tethering me to what? 

"I thought we lost you." Her sobbing voice was muffled against my body. Definitely not Maria. 

I groaned through my teeth, not enough to form words, but enough to indicate my presence. 

"Oh!" She jolted up. "Oh my gosh. Andrew? Can you hear me? Say something!" 

"What...happened..." The question was difficult to pronounce; my lips felt like they were a thousand pounds and my tongue was lazily flopping like a fish in its death throes. 

"You were in an accident," she whispered into my ear as she stroked my hair. "You were in the middle of the highway. The car tried to stop, but couldn't avoid you in time. You have broken legs, a broken arm, several broken ribs, and a serious concussion. But you're stable. You're going to be okay. Brenden is so excited to see you."

Brenden? 

"Andrew?" She asked, pivoting the conversation somewhere else. "Where have you been?"

I didn't understand the question, but I had a more pressing one to ask her instead. "Who...are...you?" 

"What?" 

"Who...are...you?" 

"I'm...Andrew, it's me. Natalie." 

My eyes peeled open, the world filling up with color and context. I saw her standing over me, with brown hair, thin eyebrows, green eyes red from weeping. 

I had no idea who she was. 

She could see the confusion in my eyes, the lack of recognition. "You remember me, right?" There was a sardonic laugh between her syllables, covering for her fear. Her anger. 

"No." 

Her face dropped and her eyebrows furrowed. There was a noise at the door and she looked up. "He just woke up, can it wait five goddamn minutes!?" Gone was the gentle woman and out came the lioness. 

"I'm afraid not," a familiar voice answered. 

I turned my eyes to the left. Omar was standing there, clean shaven and a new haircut. He was holding my suit in his hand and a serious scowl on his face. There were several uniformed police behind him. "It's a matter of national security," Omar answered.
