Captain Redwood responded over the radio, "Who are you? Identify yourself."

"Are ye deaf? I be Cap'n Danny Jones. We come to join the fight." The new ship responded, and as the waters settled the features of the ship became clear. First, it was made of wood. Second, it was rotting away. The hull was damaged and the sail torn. Stray ropes hung off the side. It was far from sea worthy, and yet it sailed as smooth as a modern cruiser. With arms to match as it fired another round of cannons destroying the remainder of the fighters. "Who be the leader of this fleet? Be it you?"

"Aye, This is Captain Arthur Redwood, acting Admiral of the Spartan Fleet"

"Aye, I rather fancy myself a Spar'ton. Cept I never find myself fancying me first mate." Cap'n Jones laughed along with the rest of the crew hear through the radio.

"Listen, we an aircraft come to repair and refuel our ship," Captain Redwood explained, "If you can just hold them off-"

"Aye, we can do better than that." Cap'n Jones laughed, "Men, to battle."

The Flying Dutchman started flowing through the water as if physics were a suggestion. It fired on two drop ships dead on and sent them under the water. A third ship followed but instead of firing the Flying Dutchman raced up to it and crewmen started to jump into the ship, "Captain Jones," Redwood called over the radio, "Are boarding the enemy vessel?"

"Aye, Cap'n Redwood ." Jones came in clear as day, "Would you like us to-" A gunfire deafen the radio before Jonas return, "-to take prisoners. I suggest giving that order now before it be too late."

"Negative. Just asking why are you taking such a risk?'

"Risk of what? Death?" Jonas laughed like a maniac. To which Redwood had no reply

The Flying Dutchmen patrolled the waters around the Virginian Pride and even helped a few ships regroup. The ghost didn't seem to mind the bulk of the Horde weapons as laughter was heard over the radio every time the horde ship tried to engage the Dutchmen. "This bugger may move at the speed of light, but I move at the speed of Death!"

Three hours the Dutchman held the line with glee allowing the Virginian Pride to return to the fighting. Captain Redwood hailed the Flying Dutchman, "Come in, Captain Jones. I need a status report."

"Our status be fine, Cap'n Redwood. Are ye ready to rejoin the battle?"

"We are, but please clarify. Are you reporting no casualties  among us your crew?"

"Aye, their beams of light do be causing us pain, but we be still at full strength."

"Understood. they seem to be launching another wave."

The incoming wave wasn't any bigger than the previous fifteen waves. Each of which was defeated in turn, but it was to note that the fleet had been cut down to a fourth of its numbers. The majority of its heavy hitters were also gone due to concentrated fire from the enemy. Luckily the fleet's newest addition provided more than enough firepower to keep the odds even. The flying Dutchman didn't just sail around with supernatural grace. It seemed to jump around the water. Almost being in multiple places at once. Soon enough another wave was nearly gone. Unfortunately the fleet still lost ships throughout the fighting. The Spartan fleet was made up of ships from across the globe numbered over 300 at the beginning of the invasion. Now the count was officially under 100. The fighting had lasted two weeks with little time for food and rest. The Horde didn't seem to have an end.

"Captain, incoming." The Lieutenant reported.

"I know. Prepare to fire." Captain Redwood responded

"Negative sir, It's not another wave. It's just one ship."

"Just one ship?" Redwood asked, confused.

"Aye, a big one."

And it was big. Large enough to have held the Spartan fleet in its original glory. It was lined with weapons and hanger bays for fighters. It was a mobile fortress of galactic scale.

"Well," Captain Redwood called out to all the ships, "I guess they finally got bored with dying."

A laugh chuckled over the radio and Cap'n Jonas responded, "Aye, couldn't have said it better. Permission to open fire."

"It's too high in the sky. How are you going to hit it?"

"This ship ain't called the Flying Dutchman for nothing."

There before everyone eyes the ragged, rotting ship lifted from water and headed straight to the mothership. The remaining fleet stared slack jawed as the ghost ship flew to the enemy. The enemy in turn counter attacked. It fired lazer, plasma, and scrambled fighters. The Dutchman dodged the attacks and fired at the fighters as it continued to the mothership.

"Lock and load. All ships!" Captain Redwood called out, "Don't just sit there. Provide cover fire."

The Spartan fleet did just that. Thousands of rounds filled the air between the sea and the Horde ship. The Virginian Pride fired its Mach 5 rail gun at what was identified as the ship's engines, scoring a direct hit. Along with the dozens of hits the Flying Dutchman was making even this massive behemoth seem to be fellable. Then fired its main weapon.

"Captain, the mothership is dropping in altitude." The Sergeant reported.

"Good to hear. Prepare to finish it off."

"Sir, wait. There are reports of energy build up-" the lieutenant tried to report

The beam came from the front of the ship. The light was blinding as it ripped down into the ocean below. Three ships were hit directly. The water the beam hit was boiled away causing waves across the area. The Virginian Pride was thrown onto another ship. The Mexican ship Spaniard's Bane was crushed under the weight of the bigger and more solid vessel. It sank before any kind evacuation could be sounded. None of its crew was recovered. Another 10 ships sank from collisions or being capsized. 14 ships in total were lost in a single attack.

"All units! Concentrate fire on that weapon!" Captain Redwood ordered, "That includes you Jonas! Do you hear me."

"Aye, I needn't be told twice."

The fleet fired in full force. Including a super weapon fired by a trio of German ships named Einstein, Zweistein, and Dreistein. A gravity well cannon, or something. What it did was focus even more of the attack on the weapon until it was destroyed as it tried to fire again.

"Captain, the mothership is gaining altitude. I believe it's retreating." The Sergeant called in joy.

"Don't assume anything" Captain Redwood yelled back.

But the ship simply continued to rise until it exited the atmosphere. Battles were still raging across the globe, but the moment the pocket of ocean the Spartan fleet had defended was quiet. The rare moment was enjoyed. Across the fleet the sailors feasted on military rations and slept like the dead. Except for one captain whose mind weighed heavy with the thoughts of the dead.

"This Captain Arthur Redwood. Come in Captain Davy Jones. Do you read me?" Redwood stood out on the deck of the Virginian Pride. The hot air cooled as the sun made its own retreat to fill the sky with the horrifying sight of stars and not stars. Of the not stars a solid line could be seen across the sky. The enemy had plenty more to throw at the Earth, and the Earth had plenty more to throw back, " Repeat. This Captain Arthur Redwood. Come in Captain Davy Jones. Do you read me?"

"Aye Cap'n, I read you." Cap'n Jonas's voice crackled over the radio, "What can I do for ye?'

"Tell me why?"

"Why what?"

"Why everything? Why are you a ghost ship? Why did you fight with us? Why did you follow my orders?" Redwood asked, wondering what if any answers he would get."

"Well the first off it's mighty rude to ask a man about his curses, so I'll have you think twice asking that."

"Fair."

"As to why I flew myself in your fight, well that's an easy one. I ain't never care about no nation, and no nation never care about me. But I would have my cursed arse burnt in hell before I would let some space bugger come down and take my waters. And I thanks ye for that Cap'n"

"Thank me? What did I do?"

"That would be the answer to ye third question. Ye was the one who summoned me."

"Summoned you? How's that?"

"With all that hate in ye heart Cap'n. I was able to smell it from the bottom of the ocean."

"The hate in my heart." Redwood said flatly.

"Ay, don't tell me you think a ghost pirate is attracted to happy thoughts and rainbows. I go after foulest of my fellow men. The most greedy, most arrogant, and most hateful souls I can smell and I take them."

"Take them where?"

"Ay, there you go being rude again. Just know you needn't worry about me taking nothing of yours. The hate in your heart is special well that would out shine even The Good Lord wraith. I'll be waiting and ready for the next battle. Me and my growing crew." The crackling of the radio became worse as Davy Jonas added his own crackling laughter before cutting out completely.

Soon after Captain Arthur Redwood was promoted up the rank Fleet Admiral, and even further to Union Admiral of the United Navies. A rank was earned and needed over the course of 5 years of invasion. While battles across the land were fought under the flags of every nation, the battles across the water were fought under the flag of the United Navies and under the command of the Union Admiral. With every battle he sailed into turning victorious as the wails of the Flying Dutchmen followed.
