"This it?" asked Tom.

"Yes." answered Jill.

They were standing in front of an England home built centuries ago, much like the rest of England outside of London. The well kept wooden structure was three stories high. It was a place where families were raised, and that gave the two a good feeling.

"Whelp, let's go." Tom started to the door. Jill nodded and followed.

They knocked on the door and waited.

"Nervous?" Tom asked.

"Oh, yes. Super nervous, but this could be it. We may have found her." whispered Jill before the door opened revealing a woman who seemed as old and well preserved as the house.

"Yes?" The old lady queued, "Can I help you?"

"Yes ma'am. My name is Tom, Tom Kat, Spelt with a K. Well, Thomas Kat, but I digress. We're currently doing a school program on some of the oldest families in London and was wondering if we could use yours." Tom lied as well as others swam. "May we come in?"

"Oh, but of course!" The lady cheered, "I would simply love to entertain and help in your program. Come, come."

She issued the duo into the house and into the sitting room. She brought tea and snacks as she introduced herself as Margaret Smither.

"Now, Tom and Jill was it? Where do you want me to begin?" asked Margaret.

"Wherever you wish? Jill will be taking notes." replied Tom as he eyed Jill.

"Oh, right." Jill scrambled to pull a notebook and a pen.

"Well, my very first memory was actually of my great grandfather's funeral. He was a veteran you see."

And so the two sat as Margaret recounted her family's history. Hours went by and every hour was filled with new subjects. The tension England had with other nations, The Horde Invasion, and many new laws passed in its wake. The two sat there listening to all of it as Jill pretended to take notes. The truth was they didn't care about the Smither Family's history. Well, not too much as, but they couldn't directly ask about their real subject without alerting her. Lying had its consequences, but it also had its rewards, if used properly.

"Now that's all I can remember, but I do believe I have books going further back." Margaret stood up and started to eye a bookshelf.

"We would love to read them, but we were also wondering about more recent history. Ms. Smither, you do have children, correct?" Tom asked as he pointed to a photo showing her with said children.

"Well yes. Plenty. As any proper England woman should. Grandchildren too, but I don’t feel comfortable talking about-"

"We don't need too much information, just enough to confirm the family's continuation. Could we start with your son?"

"My son?" Margaret tensed with displease as she almost spit, "Which one?"
