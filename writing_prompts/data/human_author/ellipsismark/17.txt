Author note: well I don't like it. The flow is off, and the dialogue is meh, but it was fun, so I'll post it. This story is a part of my r/worldofdemihumans 

A few notes:
- Melissa is the adoptive daughter of Odin. Thus "Odinson"

- Jennifer is a mutant, which means she a x men(you reads comics). Mutants are often looked down by others. 

- Jennifer power is "omni vision" which means she can see anything. Her strength was just normal strength gathered by rational fear.

- ask any other questions you may have
