"It is the existence of the demi human that has allowed humanity to survive in a world of greater beings. From those born demi-gods to those who's blood simply grants them greatness. It is both the scale and variety of the non-mundane that allows man to defy fate and even cheat death outright." -Benjamin Franklin, A Brief History of Demi Humans

"Because I'm not a necromancer, Jack!" I yelled and slammed my fist on the coffee table, "I am a super genius! This is what I have!" I was yelling at my max volume which was enough to get people to start calling authority figures, but I didn't care.

"Fine, Ivan. Then let me do it." He was already reaching for his book of spells, but I cut him off.

"No! I got Mary killed." My voice was much softer. "I'll fix this."

"It's not that big of a deal. I can just-" He tried to talk me down, but I wasn't having it.

"Yes it is!" Back at the top of my lungs, "It was my experience that got her killed! It's my responsible!" I turned the switch and the two lasers fired out focusing the energy to open the portal. The portal was an invisible disc that gave off light than marked it's location but revealed no detail.

"Fine."

"Fine! I love you." I turned to the portal, "I'll be back soon." and leaving behind my boyfriend of seven years I jumped through the portal to save my best friend of twenty years.

I clicked the tape recorder on"Experiement.... fucking mercy. Mary." I called out. "Mary!" I yelled, "What experiment is this?"

"I don't know. You were keeping track of that." She said over the intercom since her voice wasn't nearly as powerful.

"No I wasn- Nevermind." I focused back to the recorder, "Experiement Omega because this the last one we're doing. When done we'll be able to store millions of kilowatts in the space of liter sized water bottle. Preparing final points. Mary, are you ready." I said the last bit over intercom

"No, Ivan. I'm not sure about this." Mary voice was firm, "Don't you think we're processing too fast?"

"Mary, I've done the calculations a dozen times and digital mockups all came back positive." I was more than annoyed at this point. Eight year of research was about to pay off. Impatience was starting to set in.

"Did you have Jack do a scrying?"

"Jack doesn't know how to scry or divine the future which is what you meant. Now stop stalling!" I could hear the intercom struggle to match me in volume, but speaker only had so much voltage.

"But Ivan-"

"Mary, if this is a bad idea I will personally build a time machine and call myself a fucking idiot. I promise."

That was when I busted through the door, pointed at me, and said "You fucking idiot!" at in impressive volume. "The experiment goes wrong and Mary gets flash fried."

"The fuck is that?" Mary was deeply confused.

"Umm... I just busted in and... warned myself?" I tried to ask.

"Yes, I'm warning you about the experiment. Mary gets killed from it. So don't do it." I explained.

"Okay, but what goes wrong?"

"That I can't tell you. Stability of knowledge. I'm already pushing it doing this."

"Right. All information must have a starting observation because if not then where the original shaping of information come from?"

"Exactly, and I even ensured I could start an impossible knowledge loop by never looking into what failed. So don't bother interrogating me! but if I had to guess-"

"The radioactive power transfer. But all the mockups-"

"Couldn't take in quantum bullshit into account. Run it through the a QPC. See what that gets you. After you built the time machine to warn yourself that is." And I turned to exit, "Can't have a binary event loop afterall."

"Well how do I do that?" I asked me.

"Figure it out. I did." and I left.

\-----

I returned and could tell something was wrong. My head was fuzzy and the world didn't seem right. I looked around at the small apartment Jack, Mary, and I all rented together. Nothing popped out until the front door rattled and Mary came through.

"Mary! You're alive!" I exclaimed.

"Yes I am." Mary agreed.

"Where's Jack?"

"What do you mean?"

My heart collapsed. Jack was gone. He was somehow gone from my life. Mary was my best friend. We had known each other since pre school. We were the only ones could tolerate each other, understand each other, accept each other in those days, but Jack was my soulmate. The two of us could talk, fight, or research our crafts without tiring. Mary made happy, but Jack made me... complete. Was I having to choose between them? Was the universe inflicting a cruelty on me for my hubris? I started to cry.

"Ivan, what wrong?" Mary concern was clear in voice.

"Jack is gone." I said through the tears.

"What?" Was her only response.

"I was in the shower!" Jack cried out from behind them.

I turned around to see Jack in nothing but a towel and dripping water, "Jack! You're here!"

"Of course I'm here, Ivan." Jack tried to yell, but could never match my our voice. Not without magic at least. "We have a date tonight, remember. You said you needed to do a quick errand and we would go."

Pain shot through my head. What he said was true, but also not. We haven't had any plans. I had spent almost every moment on the time machine. And I tried to explain, "No, I had to build the machine... in order to-"

"The time machine? We've been working on that for six months." Mary added, "Apparently you needed to quote, make a quick stop in the past."

"What? No, It took me three months. I worked non stop on that." I looked out the window and that when it clicked. My mind had two sets of memory from two timelines. The autumn sun that was shining when I left was now replaced by a winter with firm hold. My three months of work were replaced by three months of bickering with Mary and Jack, plus another three months of extended time. It would have been concerning if not this being the symptoms of a successful non-splitter time alteration. I did it. I saved my best friend. Six months of my life and some headaches were a small price to pay to have her back.

"I'm not surprised," Jack cut in, "Your work ethic is always unpredictable."

"You know what? It likely took longer because you were distracting me!"

"Distracting you!" Jack shouted in surprise and started to cut into me, to which I cut back as was standard.

After a while Mary chimed in, "Oh, Sweet- Fucking- Mercy! You are made for each other. I hope you two make each other miserable forever."

"Thank you." We both shouted back.

(Hello. Thank you for reading. To clear up a bit of confusion up, this takes place in my own IP world called "World of Demihumans" where- well basically where the trope "All myths are ture" is true, but also includes extra bullshit. Everyone is either a "mundane" or "Demihuman". Ivan and Mary are both super genius mutants, and Jack is a spellcaster. If you have questions, ask them. I'm trying to get into writing more.)
