"Thanks. Me and Mikaelson always make that joke." Danforth stood up looked around. "Of course his cause of death has me a bit worried."

"Why is that?"

"Look at him." Danforth gesture to the body, "The bastard popped himself. He came here to get out, and when he couldn't, he blew his head off."

Cass looked at the body. The gun still its hand. In his hand. The gun wound through the mouth to the back of head. The sight made Cass pale.

"First time seeing a dead body?" Danforth lit a cigarette and pulled a drag.

"No." Cass stepped away from the dead man, "I've seen a lot dead body actually, but they were always more..."

"Romantic?" Danforth guessed.

"Yeah." Cass agreed, "That works. I've seen a brain before today. That's for sure."

"Well keep in mind that whatever is down here is worst than an empty skull. Come on. Keep your gun ready."

They made their way down the hall. Sweeping and scanning as the pass doorways and intersections. After a dozen room sweep Cass spoke up, "You know, they say you should live a life without regret, but I'm really regretting not bringing a bigger gun."

Danforth stopped in his step. He started making a choking sound. He lurched forward covering his mouth. The choking sound grew in his throat until it exploded out into a rolling belly laugh. "Oh Sweet Mercy! That's hilarious! I remember saying the same thing back in my rookie years."

"You didn't always pack a Big Shot?"

"Nope. I used a standard issued Cowboy Killer at first. Took about a whole to learn that lesson." Danforth looked back at his partner with a smile, "I guess you're smarter than."

Cass smiled back. Before she could say something back a noise came from down the hall. They both snapped their eyes and barrel down the hall.

"I'm Agent Danforth from The Department of Demi Humans! Come out with your hands up!"

Nothing moved from where they had heard the noise. They stood motionless keeping their senses open to the slightest signal. It was Danforth years of experience that tipped him off to focus his ears behind them allowing him to hear the slightest of creaks. He whirled around training his gun on the giant bug on Cass head. He fired once and the thunderous boom ripped it apart into paste.

"What the fuck was that?" Cass nearly panicked.

"A spider." Danforth said. The gooey glob was shaped enough to show eight countable legs confirming his comment. "I bet there's more."

"I bet there isn't." Cass squeaked out stepping away from bug goo.

"Well I hope you win that bet. Come on." Danforth made his way deeper into the hall. The lights were all still functioning fine and nothing seemed out of place. There were no signs of struggle or even of regular spiders as they continued out. Eventually they came to a door marked simply "Lab" in black letters. Danforth turned to Cass, "Ladies first?"

"You know, I could come up with something clever to say to that, but fuck no!"

"You're lost." Danforth pushed door open found the missing people. At least he guessed that who were in the cocoons of spider silk being spun by the monstrous spiders crawling over them and across the massive web the stretched between them "Sweet Mercy. What is this?"

"Ah, more food more for my brood." A silky voice came from the ceiling. A spider like creature came down from the far wall. It had the torso of a female human and head to match, but the limb were seemingly imbedded into the spider core of the body. "We were worry if we would have enough to mount out journey."

"Journey to the surface of course." The spider lady said, "Where we can feast as we wish."

"Wrong!" Agent Danforth trained his Big Shot on the spider lady's head, "Any being that preys on humans of any classification must follow proper hunting regulations."

"Ba!" the spider lady screeched, "I care not for the rules of my prey. Now submit and your death will be quick."

Danforth cocked the hammer of his Big Shot, "You have declared a disregard for federal law as well as threaten federal agents. I am legally obligated to offer you due process without arrest. Come quietly and you will have full entitlement to any rights applicable to you."

"You have chosen to suffer." The spider lady tsked, "So be it."

"Agreed." Danforth pulled the trigger unleashing another crack of thunder. The bullet flew straight to the spider lady before a wall of light flashed in front of her leaving her unharmed. Danforth lowered his gun looking at the unfazed monster. "Yeah, that figures. My fault for thinking is was going to be that easy."

"You should have submit when you had the chance." The spider lady sang as more monster sized spiders lowered from on high. "I am greater than a mere mortal."

"I get that, but what about your minions." Danforth flicked his gun to other bug and fired two more rounds of thunder that undid the bodies they hit, "Looks like I can handle them with my boots."

"You arrogant! Children! Kill him!" An army of spider came down from the walls.

"Cass, take this. Check the pods for survivors." Danforth tossed a combat knife to Cass before bolting deeper into the lab. He fired of two rounds before turning out of sight the bulk of the bug following him.

Cass got to work cutting into one of the pod near the ground. A scientist was inside. He was awake and terrified. He babbled about the spiders and experiments they were doing. "Stop, just tell me three things: Do you know a way out? Can you move yourself? Do they have any weaknesses?"

"Umm..." The man struggled his way out, "I do. I think. And I looks like I can. The toxic is flushing out, so we should be able to move again. And no. Nothing that could help."

Cass snapped her fingers, "I didn't ask for your opinion. I asked for weaknesses. Anything?"

"No. Nothing." Scientist was still in a panic as he thought his hardest, "I mean, maybe pesticides, but at their size poison gas would be better. But we don't have a gas system for that."

"Okay, whatever." Cass snapped her fingers and handed him her own standard issue combat knife, "Help me cut people out."

Danforth made his way through the labs twist and turns popping booming shots and reloading as needed. The only down side to the Big Shot was how you had to pull spent case one at a time and replace them the same way. Every six shots Danforth had to spend a whole two second reloading. Thankfully each round was powerful enough to rip through multiple spiders if he lined them up right. Which was easy enough as they tried to swarm him by the hundreds. The spider lady ranted and raved as she tried to shoot webs seemingly to catch Danforth who dodged with a grace of much younger man. Unfortunately Danforth running came to an end. As he turned down another hall of computer he was stopped in his track by a wall of webbing. Worst, by his count he was out of ammo, and he doubted Cass had extra.

"The little bug has nowhere else to scurry. Time to die." The spider lady crawl into the hallway.

Danforth reached into his coat and pulled out a fresh cigarette. Using the barrel of the Big Shot he ignited the thin paper before pulling the flame to life. "I really was trying to hold back. Not that I care about you or the people here. I just don't like having to break out the big guns. Always leaves me feeling itchy in the morning."

"You will not see another morning. You have nowhere to run." The spider lady boasted. "I have trapped you in my web. You have nothing."

"Wrong. I got this." Danforth lifted the cigarette between his fingers.

The spider lady stepped back, "What game is it?"

"I call it 'smoke or fire, which one will get you?'" Danforth flicked the tiny paper stick across the space where it landed the back the spider lady. Before she could react Danforth snapped a finger and a fireball erupted out of the cigarette causing the spider lady to scream out.

"You worthless nothing!" She shot a string of web at Danforth who stared the attack down into an explosion of fire. He swept an arm across sending a wave of flame out sending the spider lady back even more. Still she spat insult and threats. The force field that stopped his bullet was holding the flames back, but the heat still passed through causing the smell of burn hair to fill the air.

"Listen." Danforth spoke without mercy, "Despite my gruff demeanor, I am in fact a nice man. So I'll offer one more chance. Come with us quietly. You're get a lawyer and everything."

The spider hissed in response.

Danforth smiled, "I was hoping you would say that."

Back in the main area Cass had free dozens of people and also sound a few who were drained dry leaving leathery corpses behind. "Okay, listen up everyone. That almost everyone on the ground. Start making your way to the exit. Those who can help others do so."

"Wait. You're not coming with us?" The first freed scientist said.

"I wish I could, but I can't leave my partner." Cass dashed into the webby maze. The group was far from helpless now. Everyone seemed have been armed with pistol and some of the older scientists were even experienced in combat. Which wasn't surprising. She knew they could handle themselves. Danforth could also handle himself, but the spider lady was still the biggest known threat. So Cass decided to join the fight, and soon her nose was filled with the face twisting scent of burnt something. Turning a corner she saw Danforth leaping into the air dodge an attack. Cass leveled her Pop Gun and started firing. The gun barked and the level shield stopped every shot.

"Bullets don't work remember!" Danforth yelled as he sent another wave of fire out.

"I didn't expect the shield to be omni directional." Cass said as put away her Pop Gun and pulled out a scepter, "Listen here you fowl thing. In the name of both The Heart Council and The United States, I order you to stop your evil deeds!"

The spider lady turned to face Cass, "I will drink you dry!"
