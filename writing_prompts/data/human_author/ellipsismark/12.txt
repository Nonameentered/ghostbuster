Our 30th anniversary just past. It's been twenty four years since he told me about his immortality. He told me just after I confessed my greed and begged forgiveness. I had planned to take everything of his after he died, but that scheme was ruined when I fell in love.

I looked into the mirror. I rubbed my fingers over skin and parted my hair. They were perfect. Not one wrinkle or grey hair. I went to the study of my husband and entered. "Dear, are you here?"

"I am." He scribbled on to papers that he would give to an employee to work the digital parts he refused to learn.

"Dear, I've noticed that I don't seem to be aging."

"Yes." He answered. He was working at the moment, and while the man could anything in the world he could only do one of them at a time. I would not receive of the sweet honey words he won my heart with. "Is there a problem?"

"No. I'm just confused."

"By?"

"I don't seem to be aging."

"You're not. Obviously."

I stared at him, "How is that obvious?"

He pen stop and he looked at me in confusion. "Because, you're not. You're immortal."

I blinked, "How am I immortal?"

"Because we're immortal."

"We?"

"Yes. We."

"How are we immortal. I just thought you were immortal."

"Well yes." He placed his pen down. "I have eternal life. You are my wife. What is mine is yours. Therefore, my eternal life is your eternal life."

"But, you're so old." I noted. His body was wrinkled from blad head to toe and his teeth was dentures, "why am I still young while you're so old."

"Because I was already 87 when i became immortal. You still young. So you'll stay young."

I stared my gaze turned hot, "Deary, my love, my heart, my soul incarnate, I have living in existential crisis for over two decades thinking was going to shrivel up and die, and only now to tell I never need to worry!"

"I thought you knew."

"WELL I DIDN'T!"

He jumped causing the desk to shake, "well I'm sorry my love. I can try to find a way to make up to you after I finish my work."

"You're damn you will. And you better hurry, because learning I have eternity has ironically made me impatient." I turned and stomped to the door.

"I love you." He called out meekly.

"I LOVE YOU TOO!" i said back and slammed the door.
