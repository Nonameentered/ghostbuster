 “The opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.”

\-Sun Tzu, The Art of War

"Call me Liar Liar." Said Liar Liar in his tweed suit and tie. With it he was possible the most average looking man in world.

"Okay... Liar Liar. How did you get past my defenses?" The Mad Scientist said with calm rage. His graying hairs slicked back goggles and sweat.

"With my legs." Liar lifted his left foot and jiggled it. Luckily wisecracks didn't shuffle the truth.

"Well can I help you? Or should I just kill you and be done here?" Said The Mad Scientist.

"Well the question isn't can you help me. The question is: Can I help you?" answered Liar with flair.

The Mad Scientist stared for a heartbeat suppressing the urge to kill, "Well, can you?"

"I don't know. If I did then it wouldn't be a question. Now would it?" Liar mocked, "Dumbass."

The Mad Scientist was ready to pop, but something kept him from snapping. The mission. It still needed to be completed. His revenge was only a button push away. The whole world would understand soon. "I don't have time. I'll just assume your some kind trickster and I couldn't kill you if I wanted to."

"Nope. Put a bullet in me and I'll die like everyone else when to fire that weapon of your." Liar said nonchalantly.

"So you know about my plans?"

"Kinda hard not to know about the massive earth work you've been doing. Some advice: Plan your dirt dumping better next time." 

"I won't need your advice. After I fire the weapon I'll be fulfilled!" The Mad Scientist shouted.

"Right, because if you can't be happy then no one should be. Correct?"

"It's more than that. I'll have my revenge. The world took everything from me. So now I'll take everything from the world." The Mad Scientist ranted.

"Yeah, yeah, your mom is dead. Join the club." Liar thought for moment, "Well actually-"

"It's more than that!" The Mad Scientist, "My mother didn't die in labor. She died before I was born. They had to cut me out of her corpse and then didn't bother to keep track of me. My father was told he lost everything when he return from the the front line. When I finally tracked him down he was just pasted on his death bed. I never got to talk to him, and the family I just found deny me and took my inheritance after I proved my legitimacy. That's only my so call family. My shame from the university as they deny my glory but used the fruits of my labor. The very fruits I use today."

The Mad Scientist slammed his fist on the console and started to cry, "Taking Sarah and Adam from me. Denying them the help they needed. Even after all my work they were toss aside and left to die."

"Yeah, plague sucks." Liar said flatly, "So you became a bad person and decided to ruin the world hoping others will become bad people?"

"What!" The Mad Scientist in rage, "I am not a bad person. When I fire the weapon the world will learn to appreciate what matters. To appreciate those who do what needs to be done. To appreciate me."

"So you're doing this to make people like. I think that's sadder than what I said."

"People will understand what it's like to be me. To suffer everyday for things beyond your control, and to have everything you work for become another pain in your life."

"At the low price of being the world that screwed them over. Stare into the abyss."

The Mad Scientist cried with the world ending button in reach, "I just want to be understood. Is that so bad?"

Liar twitched wanting to give an answer, but catching himself before it slipped. This one won't do. "Depends. Mostly on whether you're a bad person."

"Am I a bad person?" The Mad Scientist whispered.

That was it. It was over.

"Yes. You are."

The world was saved.
