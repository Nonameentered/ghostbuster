\[4/4\]

We met in the front courtyard. The entire freshman class had followed and many upperclassmen seem to had taken an interest through the windows.

"Okay then," Master Luke said clearly annoyed, "I will ref this duel. Say your name and what you're putting down."

He gestured to me first, "I am Danial Weber The Second.  If I lose I will dropout of New World Academy."

Elizabeth didn't wait, "I am Elizabeth Woodwock. Were I to lose I will swear to not speak bad of your family."

"No." Master Luke objective, "Those two are not of equal part. No matter how big you think your pride Lady Woodwock expulsion of the Academy is further greater than the privilege to bad mouth someone. I will not allow an unbalance duel to be fought. Now then we have a lot of-"

"I know." I chimed in, "How about on top of abstaining from insult of my family she also swears to cover my cost of attendance to New World, and I mean everything. Tuition, supply fees, everything."

Elizabeth looked really to kill, "Agreed. I will pay your way through the academy."

With that the deal was stuck and there was nothing left to do except start. Master Luke gave an ocean deep sigh, "Very well. That certainly will be fair. Now to cover the rules. No melee attacks will be allowed in this. Weapons, if you have any, may be thrown though. The winner will be decided will only to capable of continuing. Familiars are allowed. Direct attacks are also allowed. Any magic decided to be forbidden by any American or European government with result in a forfeit and disciplinary action. Agreed?"

"Agreed. Sebastian." Elizabeth snapped as her familiar step forward. The dragon's power was already clear and even his human form was terrifying with the suit fit for an industrial king.

"I'm ready." he said.

I wasn't because I had once again forgotten that my familiar was a fucking rock, but I tried to lie, "Yeah, I'm ready too. And I agree with the terms."

"Where's your familiar?" Sebastian The Dragon asked.

"Oh, umm... it's complicated. Let's just start." My voice shook.

"No. New World prides itself on a curriculum based around a relationship with a familiar." Elizabeth recited. Which was true. The philosophy came from the fact that having a connection with a somewhat spiritual what one of the few things the European Immigrants and American Natives agreed on, and as such the school had require one for enrollment. Which made me the idiot for having an hope of annoying their usage.

"Okay then." I squeaked and pulled out Rockstar from my backpack and set him down.

The entire courtyard stared, but it was Sebastien who spoke up. "That is a rock."

"This bit is getting old." I quietly cried to myself.

"Is this a joke!" Elizabeth nearly screamed, "I swear I will-"

"It's no such thing." Master Luke said with another ocean deep sigh, "Bachelor Weber's familiar is valid, even if we're not sure how. Now unless one of you wishes to back out now I believe we're all ready to go. Begin."

(Big fight scene. There's super hard to write and I'm wanting to finish this. Super Sorry. Promise to write if requested enough.Brief run down: Both start strong throwing big attacks. Danny gets ahead for a moment because his uniform is also magic armor crafted by generations of his forefather, but then Sebastian starts throwing out more power. They continue with Danny holding firm for a good while until Elizabeth charges for a final attack, and then-)

But just before the spell hit a massive wall of rock came up front of me blocking it. I was in awe because as the wall held the fire back I felt where the power to move that much earth came from. I looked over to where Rockstar sat forgotten glowing with energy. Not only had he somehow put up the power to move the slab of stone in front and was now trying to give me power. It flowed into me from my feet and I could feel the energy source. Miles under my feet the molten layer of earth churned, for miles around me great slab of rock moved ever so slowing knowing would stop them, and all around the earth was proudly the foundation of life. From the trees that drank the sun's ever gifted light to the human that tried to live in harmony. All of it was trying to course into me, and unfortunately for Elizabeth that power had to go somewhere or I would die. So I attacked with it.

I took hold of the Rockstar's shield and lifted it into the air, and at its peak I focused all that power into slabbing it down straight into Sebastian. The Dragon, as power and fast as he was, was unfortunately in his own awestruck state at Rockstar's effort and didn't see my attack in time. Almost a ton of stone slammed down on him at terminal velocity.

"Sebastian!" Elizabeth cried.

"Pay attention!" I shouted as I sprinting at her.

"That's not allowed." She panicked.

"Punching, no." I stopped right in front of her and put my finger right at her chest and smiled, "Point blank attacks?"

I put every drop of power I could into the spell. Not holding anything back. I unleash a massive blast of force launching her back and into a pillar. She fell face first into the grass and was motionless. Most of other student had retreated into the building when Sebastian started his attacks, so Master Luke and a few student brave enough or strong enough to hold barriers were left.

After while I panted to Master Luke, "Well, huff, do I win?"

He had actually been looking at Rockstar but was snapped back. "Huh? Oh, yes. I believe so. The winner is Bachelor Weber."

A few cheered, but Master Luke had walked up to me and asked that I come with him.

\*\*\*

"I can't believe this. This is amazing." Said Mistress Maryson as she examined Rockstar behind coke bottle glasses, "And you said some magician in the wood gave you this?"

"Yes Mistress Maryson." I answered promptly, "He didn't explain anything though. He just gave me him and I left."

Master Owlsir, who was an owl, rode Master Luke shoulder, "I'll have to try to find him. See if he can provide anymore of this."

"I'm sorry Master Owlsir, umm, sir, but what is Rockstar?" I asked.

"Bachelor Weber, what you have as a familiar is in fact something we thought extinct. Your Rockstar here is actually a stone elemental."
