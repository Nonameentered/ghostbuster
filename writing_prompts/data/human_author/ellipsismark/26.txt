"Jeez, I'm telling you Morty. Roy has really got down hill since getting bought by Disney." Rick said as he dropped another token. 

"Well Rick, if that's big a deal why don't you use your infinite science to buy Roy, or Disney, or just your own Roy, or Disney. You know, do something other bitch and kill and bitch more." Morty said losing patience watching Rick having to drop a token for every year.

"Shut Morty. I don't poke holes in your logic." Rick returned to game.

"Yes you do."
