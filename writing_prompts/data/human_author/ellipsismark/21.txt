Okay, so, the geneva convention is actually the geneva conventions(plural) and it's really wordy and spread across like 12 documents, but I'm pretty sure the wounds caused by werewolf fangs and claws would be considered a violation. Additionally, if the werewolf curse spreads that's definitely a violation and if they spread any other disease that's definitely a violation.
