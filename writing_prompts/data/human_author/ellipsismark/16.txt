Pillars

Hear me hear me

or to vice you fall

in the heart of desire

four pillars stand tall

-

First is simple with little thought

to eat and drink and fill 'til full

grow your belly wide and round

and stuff yourself with all you can pull

-

Second is a hunter always seeking prey

to have and hold in the dead of night

to take comfort and warm and return the same

even if this deal is made with might


-

The third is common though ignored

to find safety and surrender care

rest in shelter away from danger

think not of others and how they fair


-

The Fourth pillar is the one most reject

for it alone is feared by others

Blood and bone and pain this pillar seeks

and care not if draw from foes or brothers


-

Four pillars stand tall

a choice is to be made

to climb on to them

and claim the spot unpaid

-

Or stand at the bottom

to look up with disdain

to hold hate at them

to cheer at their pain

-

course these pillar are in all

of them you need not fear

for they hold up your heart

but sure to never over shear
