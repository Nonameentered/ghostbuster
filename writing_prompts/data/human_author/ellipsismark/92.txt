\*\*\* Pt2

Deedee rode the elevator down with the Californian. She was thinking about everything that had happened over the past few days. About what will happen over the next few years. She was about go across the ocean, across the world, to live with cousins she never knew about until a few minutes ago. Actually, that wasn't confirmed yet. After all, she hasn't met these people yet. They hasn't agree to take her in yet. They didn't know she existed yet. Deedee was more scared now that she was with dozes of guns aimed at her.

"Umm... Mister..." Deedee looked up at the Californian representative.

He was tapping away at a smartdevice likely writing an email, "Hmm... What is it Miss Blackfoot."

"Well, I was wondering... what if they, that is the people you're calling, my cousins. What if they say no?"

The Californian smiled, "Don't worry about that. Japanese people are very strong believers in blood family. Even then, they are boarding schools. Schools where you have your own apartment, called a dorm."

"Really? My own apartment? Can I just go there?" Deedee's eyes grew wide.

"Maybe, but I'm sorry to say it's not that great. Your whole room would only be as big as this elevator if your lucky, and you'll have to share bathroom and shower space with others. I suggest at least waiting."

Deedee giggled looking around. The elevator was a big elevator, but it still an elevator. "Okay then. I'll wait until I see myself."

The doors opened the two walked out in the lobby of the business they using, and she wondered why they were here. Surely there were dozens of better place to hold the meeting they had, but they choice what seemed to be just a normal office building, and such a high floor to boot. As she looked various signs covered in various languages Deedee had another thought. "I don't know Japanese. Like, at all. I only know English and my tribe's language."

The Californian stop at the front door, "Oh yeah. I forget that not everyone has as many as tongues as I do. But don't worry. Japan has a firm English program and can get you a tutor. I'll even help."

"You will? How?"

"We can be pen pal. I'm Japanese myself. It was my first language next to English." and they step outside where a car and women waited. "Miss Blackfoot, this is Susan. She will take you to a hotel tonight and the airport in the morning."

"What? Airport? Can't I let Candy swim me across?" Deedee asked.

"Oh, umm, maybe." The Californian answered. "But Miss Susan is suppose to escort you."

Susan said, "I'll meet her over there. We won't have to buy any plane tickets then."

"Oh, okay. Okay then. Yeah, that's perfect." The Californian never seem to be bother by changes of plan or new information. 

Deedee wondered why. Maybe it's something he learn working with the craziness, but that made think yet another issue. "Miss Susan, how are you going to meet me over in Japan without flying?"

To this Susan snapped her fingers and was gone. "I can teleport." She said from behind Deedee. Susan plucked a hair form Deedee head causing her to yelp, "And with this I'll be able to hone in on you from across the world."

"You're a demi-human too?" Deedee looked over the Californian, "And you?"

The Californian shook his head, "No. I'm mundane, but I work with a few like Susan. Now it's time we all be going. Hotel tonight, leave tomorrow." 

Deedee nodded. Explained anything to Candy who walked west to the ocean, and Deedee walked around car and was about to get in when she stopped, "Hey, what's your name?"

"Oh, I never did tell you my name. None of us did. Well my names is James. James Tanaka."

"Well James, call me Deedee."
