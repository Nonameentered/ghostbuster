"This is a rock." I looked at the stone in my hand.

"Yes." said the youthful, sleep deprived, and grumpy wizard sitting at his desk.

"I need a familiar." I said with desperation lining my voice against my will.

"Yes." He repeated without missing a beat.

"This is a rock." I repeated holding back my panic.

"I think we covered this already." He scratched his chin and squinted his eyes in deep thought.

"I need a familiar!" I was truly at my wits end.

"Oh yeah, that was definitely already covered." He declared with his index finger in the air. He looked at me and sighed, "Listen lad, you asked, I delivered. If you don't want to make the deal, then don't."

"And why should I accept this? It's a rock"

"Well first off, because it's free, and you should know how rare that is."

I did. Deals were bases of magic society and wizards were welders great forces that commend the universe to those out of the loop and magical lawyers to those in it. However, I was in the loop and knew very well that nothing was free. "Yeah, but you're still getting something out of this."

"I am." He admitted, "But it's nothing you need worry about. I swear."

"You swear?" I asked with no attempt to hide my real question.

He sighed and lifted his right hand, "I, upon my magic and my soul, so solemnly swear that I intent no harm or risk to you. That I give my part to you and in return expect nothing of you."

His words were laced with the magic of a promise. The magic of promises was something that a part of the universe like gravity. It could bind the powers of gods and demons, and such was well researched. When made The Promise Maker was compelled to use proper wording and avoid double speak. Which why I noticed a quirk in his promise. "Expect nothing of me? But you're expecting something else?"

"Do you want the damn thing or not?" He patience was running out.

I looked at the rock. It was big enough to hold in both hands and was smooth all over. Brown with prefect grey lines through it its only other feature was its flat bottom. I looked up and tried to keep my wailing desperation at bay, "Will this get me into the school?"

"Yes."

"Mom. I'm home." I said pointlessly. She was already in the room since it was the only of the house sans the bathroom. It was a hut made of dirt and wood. An actual mud hut, but that wasn't a discredit to the construction. It was incredibly well built and even had glass windows that added to redundancy of my announcement as she was at the computer desk looking out of it when I arrive. The with the solar charger it counted to our only two pieces of technology in the whole house. Three if you counted the wire between them.

"Welcome home Danny." My mother said smiling as she always did.

"Welcome home my less impressive brother." Said my smug sister Mary. My smug younger sister, "Found a cool rock out in the wood?"

"Shut up." Was all I could mustard as I set the rock down in the room.

"Danny, why do you have that rock?" My mother said with confusion, "Have you been crying?"

I had, but I ignore the question as a I present the stone," My, well... my familiar."

The room became very thick with the silence as they looked at it.

"That's a rock." Mary declared with the authority that comes from declaring the obvious.

"Yeah." Tears started to build in my eyes. "Yeah, it is."

"Son, were you pranked?" My mother said with concern, "Is this a trick?"

"I don't know. The man said it would work, and he swore he wasn't trying to hurt me or anything."

"He Swore?"

"Yes, on his magic and his soul. So I have no reason to think it won't work."

"Meow." Said the fourth inhabitant of the room. My mother own tabby cat familiar, Shadowbark, sitting on the window sill.

"I don't know. I guess I have to." I answer understanding her question of 'Are you going to try the ritual?'

She purred and stretched saying 'Well, let's try.'

We cleared the center of the room and prepared the ritual. We looked up the familiar linking ritual online to make sure we did it right, and even posted a picture on a spellcasting coop forum and received some very rude comment on how stupid we were for asking about such a basic spell on a site meant for high level spell crafting. Some even posted links to the very sites we looked up before. Safe to said if didn't work it was our fault. So we begun.

I started, "Oh fellow. I ask thee, as a gifted one, be my ally, be my partner, be my friend. Give me your serves, your gifts, your time on this world and expect in return a part in equal. Become familiar to me, and let I become familiar to you." The words said I preformed the physical part of the ritual. I lean over and kissed it. I didn't pucker my lips. No, only placed my lips on the surface of the stone just as my mother had done to the forehead of Shadowbark so many years ago. Just as my father did to his familiar. Long before he became the man who betrayed the world.

Shadowbark walked into the circle and pawed the rock asking 'Did it work?'

I stared at the rock. "I think... I think it did."

"Well, what's name?" Mary asked.

"I, I don't know." I stare at my new familiar. A rock.
