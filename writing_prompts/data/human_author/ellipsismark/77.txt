The freshmen class gathered in a circle giving the two of them plenty of room.

"Listen up, I'll be refereeing this fight." Said Master Owlsir, "The rest of the teachers will be charged with keeping collateral from exiting the fight. So stay behind them. Period. Understand?" He twisted his head to look at all the students.

"Rebecca, you really don't have to do this." Elizabeth said to Rebecca prepared for the fight.

"I know, but I hate jerks like him." Rebecca said, trying not to belittle Elizabeth, "I would have challenged regardless." Which may or may not have been true, but she had made this challenge and she would go through with it. She walked out into the middle of the field.

Damien also walked into the middle. When they were both a quarter they stopped and Damien put up one finger, "You have one chance. Back down, and I won't hold this against you little girl."

"My name is Rebecca Tanaka. Remember it after I knock your head off." She stood firm with Shippo right behind.

"Well. Alright then." Damien mumbled to himself.

"Ready," Owlsir lifted his own wings, readying to take off and watch from above.

It was that moment when a question went through Rebecca's mind. She looked around and asked herself 'Where is his familiar?'

"Go."

Fire roared from Damien's hand as he launched a fireball capable of engulfing a house at Rebecca. Distracted, she was saved by Shippo grabbing her and jumping away. After Rebecca was back in the fight fully. She started to concentrate on crafting a spell. She had seen this style of fighting before. Damien was giving all out attacks trying to win quickly. It was effective but also easy to counter. Just as she predicted Damien threw out his other hand released another massive wave of flame. Rebecca countered with wind magic. Using fire's natural need for oxygen she shaped a tunnel of air currents to redirect the fire back at Damien. Damien was caught off guard and could only block the flames. However it wasn't needed. The flame didn't seem to bother Damien much as he only covered his face with his arm.

"Ha. I guess that's your style then. Clever subversion and tactical prowess." Damien held out his hand, "Well that's all fine and dandy, but even the smartest of strategies will fall to enough raw power." and from Damien came a wave raw heat and wind. Before the fire could hit Rebecca Shippo jumped in front taking the attack.

"Shippo!" Rebecca cried out, "So what? You just brute force your way through. Well I'm just not brains." She focused an attack directly at Damien. A beam of raw energy. As it hit Damien lifted his arm to block and deflect the energy, but the attack did hurt him making him grab his arm in pain.

"Bitch, you think you can- What the hell!" Damien started to yell but cut himself off began to look around, "How the hell!"

Rebecca was confused. What was he looking at? All she did was cast the one spell and then started to cast another. Was he doing a bluff.

Konkon.

Shippo came through to Rebecca's mind. She could feel the power Shippo was projecting. Shippo had formed illusion clones of Rebecca, and while Rebecca couldn't see them herself she felt their presence. Damien on the hand saw them, but didn't understand what was going on. He could only react as two of the Rebecca jumped into melee range and began swinging. Damien blocked and countered.

"Wait a minute! Melee isn't allowed." Damien yelled looking over to Master Luke before looking up to find Master Owlsir, "Isn't this cheating?"

That was when one of the Rebeccas made contact. Directly into his face and nothing happened. No pain or even any force came with the swing. Damien stood his ground as the other also made contact with his rib. Again, nothing. He shot blasted both of the Rebecca and they burnt away. "Illusion. Damn good one too. Still worthless though. So which is the real you."

Shippo had jumped away so any of the remaining five Rebeccas could have been her, but she wasn't just idling. Rebecca had been crafting a spell. Fire was her strongest which was common upon all magic users, but Damien seem to be a master with fire based magic, and so she tried another type of magic. While Damien threw fire left and right Rebecca put her energy to the opposite using the extra time Shippo bought her to make it hit as hard as possible. When she was ready unleash a torrent of icy wind. It surrounded Damien and frost quickly grew on his body.

"Are you serious? You're trying to freeze me." Damien's teeth click, "You listen here little girl. I may be null in knowledge and skill, but I'm number one in power! Let me show you." Fire started to swell off his body as his black hair seemed to turn to a bright red. A wave heat came from him as he called, "Semper Ardere!"

From Damien shot up a bulk of solid fire taking the shape of a bird. Its wings expand the battlefield and delivered a battle cry as loud as the trumpets of heaven.

"Is that a phoenix!" A student cried disbelief.

The phoenix inhaled before firing its breath straight at Rebecca. It was again Shippo who saved her by grabbing and jumping away. The phoenix's fiery breath didn't stop though and engulfed the whole field. Shippo covered Rebecca forming a barrier between herself and fire. After the inferno was done Damien called out, "Come on now. Out wit me already." as the phoenix inhaled for another breath attack.

"Enough!" Master Owlsir shouted in a thunderous voice ending the fight. "Enough, the fight over." and it was. The grass of the field was burnt away to ash to feet the teachers who seemed to have been struggling to hold the phoenix's fire back. In the ash stood a single green patch under Rebecca and Shippo who had managed to hold the indirect fire back enough.

"Bachelor Armstrong, I declare you the winner." Master Owlsir flapped his wing to hover in front of Damien, "However I suggest you have a bit more tack next time, less I believe you attempting lethality."

"What? Listen here-"

"You would remind you Bachelor Armstrong that while challenging other students is encouraged, challenging teachers is forbidden." Master Owlsir ended Damien's protest. "Now everyone return to your dorm at haste."

So it was the freshmen class started their march, except for Rebecca who was still recovering and Elizabeth who had got to her side, "Are you okay?"

"Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks to Shippo." Rebecca ensured as she hugged her familiar, "You really are impressive you know."

"Indeed." Sebastian agreed, "To stand against a phoenix's flame. I would second guess a fight with such a beast."

"Thanks, but honestly I have no idea what Shippo is capable of. I've only had her for a few months." Rebecca admitted.

"Konkon." Shippo licked Rebecca gently.

"Come on. Let me take you to my room to wash up." Elizabeth said, helping her up.
