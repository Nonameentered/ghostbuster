"Self-sacrifice doesn't always mean giving something up. Sometimes it means accepting something we rather not have."

\-President Johnson, speaking for The US at the Intentional Peace Convention

I took a deep sigh. I finally did it. The Old Man had been here for over 2 centuries. Playing chess against anyone to challenged  him. Cursed to the game, but blessed with immortality. Well, until it wasn't a blessing, and now I was the Chess Master.

I had known about the curse before hand and decided a was going to free the man. I had played for years and years. Won tournaments across the world and even massed a small fortune. All that work to finally do one good. Of course I didn't just scroll into this with no preparation. I did my research.

First thing I discovered was the Push and Pull of the game. The game pulled on the people around it to make challenges, so matches would be frequent. The game also pushed both players into trying their best, so either could throw the match. If that had been the case The Old Man could have freed himself years ago. With these two effects one could enjoy these curse for years and years. If one enjoyed chess enough.

Second, I came prepared for the time in between games. I pulled my back pack over and pulled out the small set I had carried with me every week. A Laptop, Cell Phone, and Solar Charging Station. I started up the laptop and logged on to the Public Curse Aid Forum I had used to research and prepare.

TheRealestGamer: I did it guys. I finally did it. The Old Man has pasted on to the other.

PrincessNotAPhish: Awesome! Did the curse pass to you.

TheRealestGamer: Yep. I'm stuck. May need help with set up. The gazebo the game is in doesn't much direct sun light.

TheRealestGamer: Nevermind. I can still stand and walk around. Just can't go very far. I'm good.

ChadChadson: Did you ever look into possible evolution of the curse like I said to?

PrincessNotAPhish: Oh yeah. Don't want to spread the curse through the internet!

TheRealestGamer: Yeah. I checked everything. The curse in centered on the stone table. It couldn't pass through the internet.

ChadChadson: Alright then.

ChadChadson: Idea. Use some of that money of yours to get solar panels installed on the gazebo.

TheRealestGamer: That's a good idea. So good in fact I already thought of it. I'm in works to set up an entire system. I'm already working on using setting up trust funds in case someone unwittingly beats me.

"Hey man. You up for a game?"

I looked up to see a guy dressed like a hippie. I would have been compelled to accept, but that wasn't needed. I close my laptop and set it to the side, "Of course. White goes first."
