Melissa Odinson strided through the halls as if her four foot four statute was the tallest in the school. The other students stepped aside if for no reason that admiration of the mundane human's confidence.

"Melissa, wait!" Jennifer Knight caught up to her breathing heavily as she strided next to her, "Why do you have to walk so fast?"

"Because the world is waiting for me and I don't want to rude." Melissa responded.

"I find that hard to believe." Jennifer smiled. "In fact, you being polite is a disturbing thought."

Melissa turned on her friend, "What you trying to say."

In response a perky laugh came from a perky girl, "She's saying you belong in zoo, and I agree."

"What? No." Jennifer tried to correct the girl, "I was-"

"Who the hell are you!" Melissa shouted, "and long do you want me to knock your lights out for!"

"Oh I'm terrified." The girl stepped up and curtsyed, "Elizabeth Blugem, of the Blugem family."

"Never heard of you." Melissa said back.

"We've lead the charge in enchantment development for hundreds of years." Elizabeth flipped her blonde hair.

"And then you came along. Must be disappointing." Melissa popped off against the protest of Jennifer.

"What was that?" Elizabeth scowled. "You think you just insult me, you little mundane brat."

Elizabeth waved a finger and wisps of blue light filled the air. Melissa shouted in surprise as she was lifted into the air.

"Wow, you're barely weight anything!" Elizabeth laughed until Melissa planted a foot directly into her face, "You little, two bit bit-"

Melissa trackled her to the ground started throwing punches. Elizabeth summoned a shield to stop the small but powerful blows and sent a wave of power to knock Melissa off. The petite girl slammed into the locker and slumped to the floor.

"Melissa!" Jennifer kneeled down checking for injuries. 

"Ah, the mutant girl is worried about her mundane pet." Elizabeth laughed again, "Or is it the other way around?"

Jennifer tried to talk the girl but wasn't able to say much before Melissa rushed her yelling "Fuck you!"

Another bout of punches and spell was traded between them before they interrupted of a figure hoist them both up into the air.

"No fighting in the hall!" Ms. Steinfaust slammed the two girls' heads together in an audible crack before dropping. "Detention. Both of you. Now get to class."

"Or what!" Melissa said already recovered and picking another fight. "Who gonna make me?"

"No! Absolutely not!" Jennifer grabbed Melissa by the shirt pulled her away, "You are not starting a fight with Ms. Stienfaust. Thank you Ms. Stienfaust. Come on!"

"Wait!" Melissa tried to protest as she was hauled through the hauled by taller and apparently much stronger friend. They eventually stop when they finally got to the classroom. She pouted in her seat. "I wasn't scared."

"I know. That's the problem." Jennifer sighed, "I understand why you have to pick a fight with everything that even looks at you funny."

"Simple." Melissa lifted her chin in aimless defiance, "I don't know any other way to live. I lived on the street for all my life and I only survived because I always hit before I got hit. Never back down, never give up. Always do right, always look left."

"Always look left?"

"Yeah, always look left! Most attacks come from the left."

"They do?"

"Yeah they do! So you gotta always look left."

"Okay okay" Jennifer smiled to placate her friend. Just then a boy came in the room and looked over them.

"Hey, short stuff!" He snapped a finger gun, "Saw you popped that spell slinger in the face. Respect."

Melissa just nodded and lifted her chin high. She was the only mundane student in the whole school filled with every flavor demihuman, but that didn't stop her acting like she was biggest, baddest fucker around, because as far she was concerned, she fucking was.
