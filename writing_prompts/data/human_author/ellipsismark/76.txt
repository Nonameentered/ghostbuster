After a shower Rebecca joined Elizabeth for dinner. They ate in her private dorm. Elizabeth had explained that private dorms were a compromise between the school's open door philosophy and high society's desire to be above others, and while Elizabeth didn't think herself above others she did enjoy the luxury of her class very much.

"Thanks so much." Rebecca between gulps of tea and bites of potatoes. Sebastian was bring a another course, "Fighting really takes a lot out of you."

"Combat is the single more straining thing on the body." Explained Sebastian, "That's why so many great warriors try to avoid battle, as opposed to directly challenging the strongest opponent in the room."

Rebecca laughed, "Yeah, well I couldn't sit back and let that jerk taunt you like that."

"I do appreciate it." Elizabeth smiled, "But next thing just let it be. I really hate them, it's true, but picking every fight is not a good policy."

"True, but fighting for a friend is always a good fight." Rebecca said stuffing her face full.

"Say, do you have a dorm yet?"

"No, not yet. They should be finding me a room soon though."

"Well why not room here. I'm allowed to house three other students if I wish."

"Really?" Rebecca looked around the dorm. It was incredibly upscale having four single rooms and a full kitchen and even a library. "It is nice, but what about Shippo."

The giant fox was sitting at the window looking in. Sebastian looked at her, "She can here. There's no issue."

"What about her size?" asked Rebecca

"What about her size?" asked Sebastian

"She freaking huge, and she can't just sleep outside. She needs shelter."

Sebastian looked at the fox with confusion. Setting the food down he walked over and said something in language that neither of them understood.

"Konkon." Shippo said as she jumped into the air and became a red blur before landing inside as a normal sized fox.

Rebecca stared in shock, "What! You could do that the whole time!"

"Konkon." Shippo jumped into Rebecca and nuzzled her.

"Why didn't you shrink down before?" Rebecca petted Shippo almost in tears, "All that trouble and you were able to just, just..."

Sebastian spoke again in a strange language to which Shippo replied, "Konkon."

"She said it is easier to be big when sheâ€™s happy. I guess she never thought it important to reduce her size." Sebastian translated.

"But I asked her to become small so many times."

Again Sebastian spoke the unknown language, but this time Shippo seemed confused as she replied, "Konkon."

"Well, apparently she only understands Japanese. So she never knew what you were asking of her." explained Sebastian, "You two are going to learn how to communicate. Of course I'll help."

"But my familiar bond?"

"Only passes feeling through. Words are still important. Don't worry. It's not too hard to get the basics."

"Okay then. I guess I have to stay." Rebecca embraced Shippo in a hug, "First thing first, how do you say I love you?"

Epilogue

Rebecca was walking through halls mapping out the rest of her classes when Damien stepped out into the hall, "Hey, Rebecca was it?"

Rebecca simply said, "What do you want, jerk."

"Nothing, just want to set the record straight. Between Danny and Woodwock that is."

That made Rebecca curious, "What do you mean?"

"I mean that bitch Elizabeth hates Danny for something that ain't his fault, and at class I saw her give Danny that dirty look of hers. So did Danny." Explained Damien, "He's already in low spirits and I didn't like that bitch making them lower."

"So you were standing up for your friend?"

"Yeah, pretty much. Of course I wasn't expecting you to stand up in response, but I can respect it. Point is, I don't blame you, and I hope there's bad blood between us."

"You almost cooked me alive out there."

"Yeah, but I didn't. Besides, I'm number one in power. If I didn't show off why that was, well, who knows. If you're mad that's fine too. I just want the record to be clear."

"Fine, I understand you were being a massive asshole for one of your friend and you had to show off because you're insecure about how dumb you are."

"Hold up," Damien put his finger up, "I am very secure in how dumb I am. If stupidity were ranked here I would be number two, with number one going to the dumbfuck who thought they could take me on." He paused for a moment thinking, "So... you, i guess."

"Shut up. Get out of my way." Rebecca pushed past him and walked away.

"Alright then. See you Wednesday."
