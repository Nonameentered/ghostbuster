"I defeat my enemies by making them my friends."  
 \-Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund 

There were six people in the room. Five adults and one child, and seventh part of eyes watched outside the seventieth floor. The adults sat at the end of a long table while the child sat alone at the other scorning.

"Okay then," begin the center most adult, "Let's begin. The recorder is on. This is meeting between representatives of the five major North American countries: United States, Canada, Louisiana, Mexico, and California; and one... umm...

"Daisy. Daisy Niitsitapi officially, but my friends call Deedee." The child spoke out.

"Okay Deedee-"

"Miss Niitsitapi." Deedee cut in.

"Okay... Miss Neeitceetapee." The American tried causing Deedee to roll eyes.

"Blackfoot would be fine. I rather than hear you butcher my family's name."

"I thought the blackfoots were across multiple tribes?" Asked The Californian with an accent that would rather speak one of the Asian languages more popular on the west coast.

"We are, but you \*Civilized\* men put us all down as having the same name. European laziness I guess."

"Wasn't your grandmother Japanese?" The Mexican chimed in looking over notes.

"Yes." Deedee tried to cut the man with the word.

"So... why not use her family?"

"Why? Just to make it easier for you?"

"Enough." American ended the conversion, "We are here to speak about your relationship with Entity PA-22. Would you please-"

"His name is Candy." Deedee corrected him making the room very quiet.

"What?" The Louisianian asked. He was little more than a hillbilly in a suit.

"His name is Candy." Deedee repeated waving outside at the 72 story creature that was Candy. The local Los Angles population was staring as coalition of the NA5 kept an nonthreatening eye out. Candy's was made of scales and leather and was deep blue shade. Perfect for hiding in the ocean. Gills flexed from time to time as they were use to doing most of the breathing and didn't like being idle. He flashed his teeth which were all pointed, but only for a moment. Candy was not made for smiling.

"What kind of name is Candy? That's a stripper name." Said The Louisianian.

"What's a stripper?" Deedee asked causing the man to turn red.

"Oh, well you see... sometimes when- well some women- umm... that's a yer ma and pa!" He decided to end it on that.

"I'm an orphan."

"Uuuu..."

"I'm also fucking with you. I'm twelve, and not a strange to city life."

"Oh sweet mercy." He wiped his brow.

"Gentlemen!" American was at the end of his patience, "Can we please get the matter at hand. That being Miss Deedee and her-"

"Miss Blackfoot." Deedee interrupted.

"Miss Blackfoot and her relationship with Entity PA-22, Hereby to be addressed as Candy." He added the last bit before Deedee cut in. "Miss Blackfoot, before we go further, I must ask, are you aware that you have been officially classified as a Demi-human?"

"I don't care. So long as I'm still consider human."

"Yes, then. Are you aware that Entity... Candy is classified as a Non-Human Other."

"Other?"

"Si," The Mexican offered, "that means he's still seen as a person entitled to right and accountable, but he's... you know, not a human. Like us, you included."

"Oh. I never heard of Non-Human Others before. So you believe that Candy isn't a monster."

"Nina, I was there when you talked down the military. He's clearly smart enough to know better."

"Yes," said the American, "but I'm more concerned about his... potential."

Candy blinked his massive eyes as Deedee said, "Potential what?"

"Usage, mostly. His size, strength, and durable would make him a useful."

"Useful for what? What are you getting at?"

"I concern about how he'll be used."

"Used? You want him to be some kind slave worker!"

"Not quite. Let me a blunt. I'm worry that you'll use PA-22 as a weapon."

The room was stunned to that. The Canadian asked the Louisianian something in French and the Californian seem to know enough Spanish to engage with the Mexican leaving the American to stare down Deedee.

"A weapon." Deedee whispered, "I would never-"

"Your claim of morale will do little to calm the people. After San Diego-"

Deedee yelled, "San Diego wasn't my fault. Or Candy's." Deedee was standing and slamming her fist on the table, "If the military didn't open fire-"

"They were local forces responding to a level 6 threat. Protocol says-"

"Protocol let's you kill on sight?" Deedee's anger was get the best of her.

"Little girl, you're on thin ice."

"No!" The Californian shouted over him, "It is you who is stepping on thin ice. The United States may lead the NA5, but this still isn't your country. It is California. Now I believe you should let us lead this interview from here."

"Yeah, I second that." The Louisianan said, "After all, this conversation include more that just the room." He was looking out the window into a very large silted eye. "Something to keep in mind, Yankee."

"It's okay Candy." Deedee hands pressed against the window, "It's okay." 

"Now, to continue." said The Mexican, "You're relationship with Candy. Do you control him?"

"No," Deedee continued to stare into Candy's eye, "I don't control any of the animals I speak with."

"Right, your powers extend to all creatures. Mammal, reptile, bird. Are there any animals that it doesn't work."

"People, or humans I guess. Hasn't tried it on an alien. I don't know why."

"Of course, and now, how did you discover Candy?"

"Was swimming in the ocean talking to the fish and others when I heard him. Had a dolphin take me to him." Deedee had a though and turned to the men, "Am I free to go? Or rather, am I a prisoner?"

"No," Answer the Mexican, "There was quite a bit of damage, and well, a few deaths, but it's all being considered equal fault on both sides."

"People died?" Deedee voice cracked.

"Oh. Yeah. A few. Six by my last report I think." He rubbed his neck. He quickly rose up, "But like I said. Their being considered equal fault. No need for you to worry."

"What are you saying?" said The American, "Are you saying she shouldn't be held responsible for her action?"

"She a kid. Trying to help friendly giant. There are full time heroes with worse rap sheets. Like that President of yours."

"So we should-"

"Will you shut the hell up!" shouted the Louisianan, "I never knew what your problem was and I never cared. What important is that we got situation under control. Miss Blackfoot can't order the giant around, only answer him. That's ready the only thing we need. Now, what are we gonna do about Miss Blackfoot and Candy? We can't let them on unsupervised, but we ain't about to lock them up. So, what now."

"I don't have a home. When my parents died my tribe tried to share raising me, but I eventually left after I realize my gift. I could go back, but I'm not leaving Candy behind."

"You said you were also Japanese?" asked the Californian.

"Yes, my grandmother move soon after leaving the Japanese army and married my grandfather. They apparently met while she was serving."

"Very well then. I'll make arrangements and even see if you have family in Japan."

"What?" said the Louisianan, the Mexican, the American, and Deedee

"Why are we shipping her off to Japan?" the Louisianan scratched his head.

"In North America Candy is a giant monster that destroyed entire blocks. In Japan Candy is a Kaiju. They are fearful, but familiar. There are three other confirmed kaiju in country in fact. It will be better. Plus, you'll never be far the ocean. Are there any objections?"

The American raised his hand.

"Good. It's unanimous. I start making the calls."

The American scowled but didn't argue as he dropped his hand. Everyone stood up as the Californian pulled out a phone. The Canadian, who was the least involved, slapped the American's shoulder, "Come on now. Let's go find some lunch, eh?" and the two them left together.
