Mr. Galacto walked into Class J only a few minutes after the bell, "Alright class, settling down." he said to the already well behaved teens, "Today we're talking an on going headaches of international and inter species relations. Today we're talking about mole people."

The class was a mix of boredom and impress. "I didn't know there were mole people?" XK-88 said.

Kevin yelled from the back, "Yeah, this is news to me as well. I mean I know about the space aliens, but not this."

Samuel spoke up, "They are a private group. They are rather divided like us surface dweller, but rather mostly docile. They are especially after The International Conflict and use of super weapons. They rather not deal with us."

"All true." Mr. Galacto got the class's attention on him, "And today we're going over they assistance to the Earth's defense. Now turn to page-"

"Did you meet any mole people?" Samantha

"Yes, Miss VonBec I did meet them. If you will remember I was one of the planet main defenders at the time. Now please-"

"Tell us about it!" Samantha squeaked, "Please Mr. Galacto."

Mr. Galacto ignored her, "Please turn to page one hundred and-"

"Oh come now Teach." XK-88 chimed in, "Anyone can read an old history, but how many first accounts do we have? Way more entertaining."

"I am not here to entertain you. I am here to teach you. Now take you damn books and turn to page one hundred and ninety seven. Yes Mr. York."

"I apologize for adding to the problem," Samuel said with his tiny arm still up, "but an engrossing narrative has been known to add to the retentive capable of an audience. A personal story may be more effective."

Half the class joined in on begging Mr. Galacto and the other half didn't object.

"Very well then." Mr. Galacto gave in as the class cheered.

I was flying from Japan to England. It wasn't an common task for me to fly around nation to nation. What was uncommon were my routes. I use to have to go nearly into outer space when I flew across the world in order to prevent a panicked battalion from opening fire and sparking another war. But now the outer layers of the Earth atmosphere are filled with enemy combatants. They couldn't hurt me as tough and fast as I was, but fighting them all became tiring over time. So now I flew low and slow at only mach point nine.

I arrive in London as the sun reached it and headed to war room. The war room was an entire wing of the royal palace that the nobles allowed for central of the British forces. Europe's military center was in Paris under the command of King Louie, but England, Scotland, and Ireland needed a forward base off the mainland. This caused problems at times since they continuously required additional backing to defend their islands since nearly all their own high scale guardians were off fighting elsewhere and traveling to them wasn't always easy for most. Thus I was sent there as traveling was always easy for me. They were planning something, and wanted a line of protection while they did it.

"So, you know how to these invaders came from space?" The Head Scientist, "Well our idea is what if there's more than just them out there? We're going to launch an SOS out into the void and see who comes."

"Isn't that completely fucking stupid?" I asked up front.

"How so? These aliens are already here and they capable of contacting their own forces. So either we only reach them, or we contact another forces that could aid us. An intergalactic flanking maneuver."

"Okay, fine." I was not willing to fight about this. Either this work or it won't and the Earth was desperate for something to work.

They got the machine up and working over the course of the day with me doing a lot of the heavy lifting. The sun was setting on London when they finally got it ready. The night sea full of glowing lights from the enemy ships. At that moment I thought about the fact that they may been blocking any signaling in or out, but they turned the machine on and effect was also immediate. The ships started to move in the sky and it seemed they were moving those the machine. It clearly worked, now whether allies would show up a different story.

I took off intercept what I could. Their drone ships were fast and shot both powerful bullets and lasers along with missiles and more, but with all my power they were mostly just annoying. If not for their defenses and numbers I would have ended this months ago, but they continued to swarm the Earth. The machine continued to send its signal and up in the air I could feel it. It was a powerful signal that piercing the fabric of reality. It had to be. After all the speed of light was still a factor to they had to do something to actually get the signal through the void of space. However, there was another unexpected affect.

The radio came over the shortwave telling me to return to base, and I flew back taking another half dozen drones. The streets were lined military and a few low scale guardian all looking down at the ground which was more surprising than you would think. As a landed and a royal guardsmen cried out, "They sometin comin' up da neath." I wish remember finding simply hilarious. Not many speak those overly thick accent, but when they do I almost die from laughter. I'm getting side tracked.

There was something coming up from underneath the Earth. Not too long after I landed some drill machine came ripped from the earth and things started to climb out. The military lifted their weapons, but I they held fire as one of them waved a flag around screaming something like "Don Ye Shoot!" and as the dirt cleared I could made the shape. It was a human, or something human like at least. It was pale beyond belief and more long than tall. It wore some kind of poorly tailored clothe from moss. It was the first contact with what we term "Mole People"

The one that came up spoke a strange from of olden English that I couldn't really understand but through broken speech and gesture we were figure out the basics. Which that out machine was going through the Earth as well as the void and the underground population were getting pissed and wanted to turn it off. Which we did.

Report started to come around the world about other mole people climbing out of holes speaking strange dialects. Many giving the same description of long limbed pale skin humanoids, with pink eyes and sharper teeth as well as hands with strong nails. They told a story of being people that went underground generations ago and developing their own civilization across the underworld. They had tunnels going the across the world deep under the crust and were living peacefully until they all started getting attacked by a strange sound. That being out machine.

After they was introduced to the planning began. The mole people were planning on remaining out of the majority of fight, but that was over a year ago. They were starting to get more and more worried about the space people as they called The Horde, and starting to get ready to enter the fight, and then machine forced them to advance their plan. They offered to take on the night fight and move supply under the earth, and if reports are to be believed we may have lost without them.

\*\*\*

"I never saw one fight in person, but the stories I heard." Mr. Galacto chuckled

"Well that's what we want to hear about?" XK-88 called out, "Tell us about that."

"Well like I said I never saw one myself, but I know where you can get a good idea."

"Where?" XK-88 asked leading forward.

"Page one hundred and ninety-seven. Please turn to it now."

The class groan at the return of mundane learning.
