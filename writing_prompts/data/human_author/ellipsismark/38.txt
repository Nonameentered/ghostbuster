London. Over 5 million people lived in England's capital. All under the holy protection of His Majesty King George X. As well as those who served loyally under him in the English branch of The Department of Demi-Humans. Sure, we reported to the international offices just like the rest, but also like the rest we often handled problems in my own backyard, and London was one big backyard. Boasting a demi-human density of nearly ten percent that made for half a million more-than-mere mortals running. So no one was alarmed when dozens of demi-humans from all demitypes just started to vanish. People just head out one day and never get hear from again all the time. Tragic, but who cares. The King does, and thus I do.

The rain shrouded the city making everything hidden behind a wall of grey water. I sat in an empty flat overlooking a street corner. The air was thickened by cigarette smoke from the hundreds of cigarettes that littered the floor around me. I had brought two cartons with me and over the three days I had stood there I had been reduced to my last pack and only half us that. The sound of relief rang in my ears as the front door opened and the heavy footsteps of my partner followed.

"Oi, your loving and caring partner, Agent O'Neal, has come forth to save you." Agent O'Neal stepped into the room I was standing and preceded to search for me, "Oi, where are you? Oh, there you are, Carter! You blend so well with the smoke. Like camouflage you are."

"Did you bring the smokes?" I asked without quip.

"Oi, I knew I forgot something! I meant to myself a fifth of whiskey and a gallon of beer to wash it down." He placed a carton of Top Notch Full Red on the window ledge in front of me, "After all, if I'm going to sit around and watch you watching nothing I might as well be drunk."

"Thank you, O'Neal." I pulled out another cigarette and chain-lit it. Keeping my eyes on the spot just out the window.

"Carter, my pal, I hate to be difficult, but are we really going to just sit here and do nothing?" O'Neal asked looking me over as well as the pile of cigarette filters around me.

"We are not doing nothing. We are waiting for something." I explained.

"Oh, that's right. Them wise guys back at MI6 told ya that something was going to happen to someone at some time at this one exact spot. Do you have anything else to work with?" O'Neal whined with all the grace of a toddler.

"I know the who, the what, and the where. It's only the when that's a mystery." I explained pulling a deep drag off my current cigarette.

"Oi!" O'Neal shouted, "If you know the target then why are sitting there from happy hour to happy hour? Just stand guard when they come through"

"I don't know the target's schedule. If I miss even one minute they should come by the get jumped." I countered, "And even if I did if they were to change something I risk losing the window."

"So you're just going to stand there?" O'Neal asked as the target came into sight. A ludoyashay. One of the lizard-like aliens that landed in Russia over a hundred years ago. Name was Sofia Morozov. Female. Large for her kind. "Oi, matey, have you even gone to take a piss?"

"I don't need to urinate," I said watching Sofia. She was carrying bags. Plastic shopping bags. She wasn't bothered by the rain in the slightest.

"Boyo, I've seen you take a piss before. Many times." Sofia was walking towards the building we were in. With her own home being direct across the street this was a common route she took.

"I do not Need to urinate." Sofia stopped for just a moment to check the street before jaywalking across.

"Carter," Sofia stepped up on the sidewalk and out of the rain a grey van stopped in front of her and open its doors, "Have you even blinked?"

"It's happening!" I shouted tossing the cigarette and jumping back from the window before leaping forward and through the window into the rain. I dropped six stories onto the sidewalk and began running to the van only to be stopped by the blast of a shotgun in my chest. A fletcher shot. Multi-purpose too. I felt the harmless stabbing of iron, copper, and lead in addition to the burning feeling of silver. It wasn't enough to kill, or wound, or even slow down. Just enough to be a surprise long enough for the goons to grab Sofia and bolt. This had been their plan and they nearly made it a crack of thunder came from my outlook point and stuck the gunman down. With a spray of blood behind the other goons must have written him off because they sped off nearly missing me as they turned the corner. O'Neal unleashed five more cracks of thunder from his Big Shot in the direction of the van and missed every shot.

"Damn it!" O'Neal jumped out the window and parkoured his way down and joined at the gunman's body. "I tried to shoot the tires out, but the rain was too thick."

"Don't worry. Shotgun is still alive." I stepped over to the body to see it was still twitching. "He looks mundane."

"Good. Mundane years are always cheaper than demi-human years." O'Neal Kneeled down to the man and played a hand over his heart and then took my hand, he then prayed, "Oh Lord, Heavenly Father, Take this gift given freely from this good soul and give it on to this poor man!"

I felt the wisps of life energy leave my body and saw the power mend the wound O'Neal had ripped into him. The man breathed fully. That was O'Neal's power, the holy gift given to him by The Lord Above, to take life from a willing donator and give it to another. He could also play both parts at will, which our partnership rather useful. He could take life from me and give it to others and himself, and then as a vampire, I could always go get more for myself. It was how we managed to serve for decades on end.

The man looked around, "What? Where? I'm alive?"

"Oh, you bet boyo," O'Neal confirmed as the rain came to an end, "And you're gonna wish you weren't real soon."

We took the man into custody to be interrogated.

[rush ending]

It turned out that the goons were running a fighting ring for demi-humans in the name of some dark god. After the gunman cracked and told us everything we raided the place. Of the sixty-eight people who went missing only twelve were recovered alive, and four were still uncounted for, but that's to be expected. People just head out one day and never get hear from again all the time. Tragic, but who cares. Well, I imagine they care.
