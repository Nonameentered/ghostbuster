Author note: I really liked this Prompt. It was really fun to think about. I know I copped out at the end, but I have good reason. 1. Reddit is a pain in the arse. and 2. I didn't want to spend another 12 hours writing something that no one would read. I want to do this whole thing with a task force and stuff, but I would have to come up with more characters and write the fight scenes(which are my weakness point) and set the tone so the fighting ring/human sacrifice. So I just decided to cut it off. Sorry. So, details:

-Agent Carter is a vampire, a demonic type, and yes there are other types.

-Agent O'Neal is a blessed soul. God gave him a power, and now it's his to use.

-Carter can drink blood/life force from nonhuman creatures, so don't worry too much.

-A "Big Shot" is a 500-magnum revolver designed so that the cylinder can not be moved out of alignment meaning you have to reload each round one by one. You get used to it after not dying long enough.

-Umm... what else? Oh, Top Notch is a brand that makes everything in r/worldofdemihumans so that's that.

-Oh yeah, I completely forgot, The Ludoyashay are an alien race that crash-landed on Earth in Russia, like Carter said. They're kinda a "Warrior Hat Race" but not quite. Honour is a big deal and they're super tough. So a lot of them go into military service. And Of course, they often have Russian names and speak Russian.
