"Sucks. Doesn't it?" I said to myself. 

"What?" Was all I could say to infinite me that was speaking to the me that was that also infinite. 

"Nothing and nothing. Forever and forever." I explained to myself. "At least you get use to it."

"I do?" I asked myself knowing I would, but also not knowing, because once I didn't know and so I would forever not know, but once I knew I had always known. I thoughts all the thoughts I could think, and never thoughts the thoughts I didn't think because to think meant I always thought them. Therefore I could not think of what I haven't already thought of.

"Yeah. At least until the end. Which thankfully is right now."
