Seconded. Like, religion is the result of generations of record keeping, moral tales, and pattern recognition. Even if you don't believe in any theism it's a fact that religion is a result of the human survival strategy. All strife is the result of humans being naturally violent creatures who need therapy. Not from believing in sky magic.
