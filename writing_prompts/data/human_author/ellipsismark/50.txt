"I don't need a partner." Agent Danforth said.

"Interesting. I didn't ask." Department Sergeant Ironworth said handing a file over, "Her name is Agent Cass. She's pretty strong."

"So pair her with someone who needs the help." Agent Danforth pulled a pack of EBG brand cigarettes out of his coat pocket and started packing them, "I can handle myself."

"It's amazing. Once again, I did not ask." Ironworth held the file out further, "Take the file."

"I don't want it. I got fifty damn years of experience under my belt. I don't need some whipper snapper tagging along to just get in my way." Danforth summoned a flame to the tip of his index finger to light a cigarette. Before he could pull the first drag a sound whistled through the air and the paper stick fell apart in Danforth's lips. He looked to the Sergeant to see a wisp of power fade from his eyes.

"Take the file. This is an order." Ironworth scowled.

Danforth threw the rest of the cigarette to the floor "Sweet Mercy Iron, me and Mikaelson spent-"

"Agent Mikaelson is dead, and he's not coming back." Ironworth stabbed the words into Danforth, "Department rules say you must have a partner to operate in the field. So either take the damn file or march your ass down to HR and apply for retirement."

Danforth looked at his friend with hatred before snatching the file and leaving the office. He opened the folder to the first page outlining the basic detail. He pulled out another cigarette and lit it with ease, "I'm too old for this. What even is she? A 'Celestial Avatar'? What does that even mean? How did a twenty-one-year-old brat make it in the department?"

Danforth grumbled questions to himself as walked to the elevator. Click the down button he continued to read over the rather impressive file. Turns out the girl had been an active element since her high school years. It wasn't uncommon for DDH agents to have been troublemakers in their youth, but she had been fighting Other Beings for years. Danforth sighed. The girl was probably going to think she was hot stuff. She was going to learn fast how wrong she was. The elevator dinged and opened.

"Good morning Agent Danforth. How are you doing today, partner?" Danforth lifted his eyes to see the face of the girl in the file. He held two cups in her hands. "Coffee?"

"Agent Cass?" Danforth closed the file and looked at her. Business casual. Pants, belt, tie, but no coat. She was serious, but not stuffy. Firm but friendly. She brought coffee, an opening gesture for adults, but not implicative of any one feeling. All that topped off by a smirk that said "I really do want you to start something so I can finish it."

"That's me." She said, "Excited to work with you, partner. I understand you have a lot to teach me."

Danforth sighed and looked at the building directory. HR was two floors up. Sighing again he stepped into the elevator as it headed down the floor level. "Alright, listen up. You might think you know what you're doing, but you don't."

"Oh, I know that." Agent Cass said, "I have been fighting against a lot of really strong Other Beings for like seven years now, but actual DDH work is so much more. You guys handle all kinds of stuff, like hostage situations, gang violence, turbulent magic expansion, and tax collection. A whole different ball game from my high school days of fighting Shadow Men and dating boys."

Danforth narrowed his eyes, "I know what you're doing."

"I hope so. The whole pretend to causally show a level of expertise in a humble tone in order to actually show I do have some experience doesn't work well if you don't pick up on it." Cass smiled and lifted a cup up, "Coffee?"

Danforth huffed, "Is it black?"

"Nope, this is cream and sugar."

"Good." Danforth took the cup and downed the whole thing, "We got a long day ahead of us."

"Can't wait." Cass took her own coffee and gulped it down, "Oh yeah. I am ready!"

Danforth walked over to the DDH parking garage and climbed into the standard-issue car he had been assigned fifty years ago. The thing was aged and ugly for it, but it still outran any other street wagon than darned challenge it. The engine roared ready to tackle anything from ramming killer robots to making a beer run, and so was the driver. Danforth floored the gas and sped out of the lot. The city streets were sparse enough that Danforth was able to weave through without resistance. He was going almost double the speed limit and even ran through red lights multiple times. Near the edge of the city's urban limit, Danforth drifted into a fuel station and came to a stop.

"No comment rookie?" Danforth asked.

"About what?" Cass replied.

"About my reckless driving. You're not going to say anything?" Danforth asked.

"I figured we were going to where we needed to go," Cass answered before Danforth killed the engine. She face palmed, "Damn it, this was a test, wasn't it? I should have buckled up."

"No, it wasn't. Wait here." Danforth opened the car door and climbed out, "Or come if you want something. Just don't wonder off."

Danforth slammed the door behind him and headed inside. The cashier waved at him, "Hey Dan. How you doing?"

"Terrible. Give me a carton." Danforth said pulling out his wallet for his id and cash. He stopped when the cashier extended the carton across to him.

"I heard about Mike. Here, on the house." The cashier said.

"Wouldn't your boss get mad?"

"Boss paid for them."

"Thanks." Danforth took the carton and turned around. He moaned as Cass walked, "What are you doing?"

"You said I could come in if I wanted," Cass stated leaning over to see the cashier, "Hi. I'm Agent Cass. Agent Danforth's new partner."

"Get what you're getting and come on." Danforth barked, "Put whatever she gets on my tab. We're in a rush."

With that Danforth returned to the car and called into dispatch. The line connected instantly, "Go for dispatch."

"Agent Danforth. Requesting assignment. Combat central. High as you can go." Agent rattled off.

"Agent Danforth, you're current partnered with a rookie agent." Dispatch replied.

"Affirmative. Request hasn't changed. Give me the biggest problem you got."

"Agent Danforth, it is my understanding that your partner Agent Mikaelson was KIA, but risking the life of another agent will not-"

"Dispatch." Danforth shouted, "Approve or deny. Request hasn't changed."

The line was quiet for a moment, "Request approved Agent Danforth. Details are as follows."

Danforth took a notepad and wrote the information down. Soon after Cass strolled into the car. Danforth started the car again, "What took so long?"

"Sorry, the cashier boy was slow on the uptake." Cass rustled a snack bag, "Took me forever to get his number."

Danforth huffed, "Tell me, what's your opinion on spiders?"

Cass's face turn a ghostly shade as she stuttered her words, "Wh-what about spiders?"

"Buckle up." Danforth said smirking as he threw the car back and shifted forward into the street at the same madman pace they had come in.

***

The building was outside the city limit. Down a nameless dirt road that only farmers and criminals lived on. There were no water, gas, or power lines going to the lot it stood on yet the front lobby was lit and a water fountain had plumbing. The halls were empty and all the rooms had a layer of dust covering every surface. There was no sign of life as Agent Danforth swept every room, standard-issue Big Shot Revolver in hand. Agent Cass followed close behind with her own standard-issue Pop Gun, a much smaller but also easier to handle firearm. Keeping it at the ready as they moved.

"So, what's the deal with this place?" Cass asked as she scanned halls.

"Over twelve missing person reports are linked to the surrounding area." Danforth explained without losing pace. "Security footage from nearby fuel stations, traffic stops made on nearby roads, and one trespassing case in the neighboring field." 

"Wait, the nearest station is like a fifty miles away. And traffic stops? Where? When?"

"Near the city the edge going toward and come from this direction. These all occur over the last fifteen years." Danforth answer as he checked a locked door

"Fifteen years? How do you know there's any connection?" Cass asked

"Because all the missing persons were reported in the last one hundred hours." Danforth slammed his foot into the door knocking it open. On the other side was a stair well that went down more floors than what should be possible.

"And..." Cass squeaked, "The spiders?"

"Seven of the twelve were arachnologists." Danforth started down the stairs, "Come on."

The two agents circled the stairwell over and over. The air grew colder as they descended. There were no other doors as they went further and further down. The lights seem to become dimmer the more underground they went. Danforth did not relax as they went down checking each turn before they made it. The stone walls refuse to take a single echo out of the air cause their steps to ring like drums. Cass lost count of the flight of stair after fifty and again at forty her second try. After ninety plus floors the two arrives at the bottom where they found nothing but a door. Barricaded from their side.

"Stay on your guard." Danforth said as he lifted the bar and tossed it to the side. He tried the door. It didn't open.

"Is it locked?" Cass whispered like she was keeping a secret from death itself.

"No." Danforth said factly, "Something it blocking it from the other side."

Danforth braced himself and pushed the door in. The opened easily under his applied strength revealing the blockade to be a body. Blood was pooled around it. It wore a lab coat with casual wear underneath.

"Sweet Mercy. Is he dead?" Cass asked stepping closer to see.

"Yep." Danforth lifted an arm up and let it drop. "And he's probably used to it by now. Cold as death."

"Oh that's funny." Cass said upset.
