Agent Quil. A field agent for the Department of Demi-Humans(DDH), a government agency like that of the FBI or CIA but for paranormal beings who are still tax-paying citizens, with his partner Agent Smith.

Agent Quil is completely mundane. All human and nothing but human. His physical prowess is equal only to his mental stupidity and tolerance for pain. His partner isn't very impressive either except for his skills with a revolver and ability to not get outsmarted by a rock. Still, they are one of the most successful duos in the department due to their furious fighting style they call "Punk Tactics" which follows three core tenets: Hit Them Hard, Hit Them Fast, Hit Them Dirty.

I guess this is more of a twofer, but something I hold hard to is that all DDH agents have partners, and these two are my favorite character concept, and would like to see an outside interpretation of them.
