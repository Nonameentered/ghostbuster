"I believe the proper term is Kitsune, and they hail from the far east." Master Luke looked over a copy of Creatures of the Far Lands.

"Great. That information solve absolutely none of our current problems." Said Master Owlsir, who was an owl.

"Names are important."

"Where are we putting this thing?" Owlsir barked flairing his feathers.

"Ummm, sir," Whispered a small girl in front of them, "Her name is Shippo."

"Right. Sorry." Owlsir smoothed himself out, "The issue remains, Miss Rebecca. We need a place to house your familiar. We can't use the barn, and the stables are already past full capacity."

"Regardless, classes are starting." Master Luke closed the book, "Of course while your tardiness is excused you still need to take the exams, but we can handle that on Friday."

"Yes sir. Thank you sir." Rebecca bowed to Master Luke and then to Master Owlsir before going off to her class.

The two waved her off before Master Owlsir spoke, "Do you have any ideas?"

"What about the dungeon?" Master Luke offered.

"The Dungeon? Are you serious?"

"Sure, open up a new way near the barn and set up a dwelling. The floor is fairly safe of any threats. At least for a creature as large as Shippo here." Master Luke looked over the beast in question. A 10 ton fox currently sleeping.

"I'm sorry I'm late." Rebecca had taken two wrong turns causing her to be even later than she hoped.

"It's fine. I'm more annoyed by your interruption. Take a seat." The female teacher instructed.

"Yes ma'am." Rebecca looked around the room. It was lecture style design with seats rising in height. Most of the back rows were empty. Which wasn't a surprise, but Rebecca took a seat next to a blond girl in the front row, "May I?"

"Of course, I don't mind either." The blond girl continued to scratch out notes.

The teacher continued the lesson. Introduction to Advance Theory and Usage. After the teacher was done the class was given an hour of study time. Which didn't help Rebecca since she was completely lost. "I feel like I miss a few things?"

"This was only the basics. Didn't you study beforehand?" The blond questioned.

"The basics of advanced theory? No, can't say I did. Books aren't my strong suit anyhow. I learn better on hand."

"What's your name?"

"Rebecca Tanaka. And before you ask my great grandfather was Japanese, but I didn't really inherit anything from him." Explained Rebecca, "I know any Japanese or anything about Japan other than Tanaka being a common family name, but I don't have anything else Japanese about me. Well except..."

"What's you ranking?"

"Oh, I was late, so they're going to give me the exams Friday."

"Oh! Well that explains why I didn't recognize you. I'm Elizabeth Woodwock." Elizabeth introduced herself.

"Of the Virginia Woodwock? Your family is famous!"

"Yes, we are." Said Elizabeth as she turned her eyes past Rebecca and stared in utter hatred.

Rebecca turned to see what she was staring at, or rather who. Her eyes seem to be trained on a boy who was helping another student. He seemed normal except for the fact that he seemed to have a rock with him. A big one too. Needless to say, Rebecca was incredibly confused, but she was of the world of magic, and magic was as confusing as legality. "Okay then. So can I borrow your notes."

"No, I use a cipher in my notes, but I'll help you study." Elizabeth's attention returned to Rebecca.

"Oh, that works too." Rebecca smiled at her good fortune.
