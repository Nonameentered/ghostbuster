"If you know yourself and know your enemy, then you need not fear the result of a hundred battles."-Sun Tzu, The Art of War

The lights come on in my eyes almost blinding me.

Its eyes reflect the moon revealing it in the dark.

I approach the edge readying for my part.

I widen my stance prepare for the advance.

I jump far, knowing exactly where I'll be.

I jump high, hoping my landing will be safe.

My chalky hands grab the swinging bar changing my direction mid air.

My dirty palms hold the earth as I shift my weight and release it.

I fly and flip enough to impress.

I roll enough to be safe.

My knees tuck over another bar in time to support my fall.

My knees fold up letting a whipping tail to sweep under as I hover for a single second.

I look and see the people.

I look and see the monster.

Fear engulfs my body. I lose my focus.

Fear engulfs my body. I lose my thoughts.

I'm released, but I loss my timing. I flail my arms.

I'm trapped, but I'm ready for this. I prepare my shot.

I lose my flight and fall to safety.

I fire my shot and fell the beast.

\*\*\*

I looked over the beast and listen for others, but not for long. These creatures were not pack hunters and were jealous with their prey. In fact the only they tolerated each other was during mating season. One pairing could make 20 more in a single season, and thankfully they killed most of each other soon after hatching. Made my job hell of a lot easier.

The bullet went straight in the eye and straight out the back. I used a 44 magnum revolver with extra heavy bullets. Holy arms worked great for evil and infernal creatures but a bullet to the skull was pretty universal, and almost nothing can survive six rounds in the head which it had after I put the other five in it.

"Welp, that was easy." I said boldly reloading and started to drag the creature's corpse back to the farm house. As I got past the gate the light came on and the farmer open the door as I neared.

He was clearly of African decedent and with shotgun in hand he looked straight in my eye and asked, "What's the password."

"Kiss the darkest part of my white German ass." Which exactly was the password I decided on after he pissed me off, "The thing is dead." and I dropped it.

"Was it alone?"

"I would bet a whole farm if I had one on yes. These things are called Massachusetts Cow-eaters, and they're known for openly killing their own kind. If there are more then they're far away and someone else's problem." I said looking over tree line I just came from.

"And I guess they could pay you. Speaking of." The Farmer stepped out shouldering his gun.

I waved my hand, "Forget about it. You're broke ass is safe. I got this thing a prime condition. The hide makes good leather, I know some freak who will buy the meat, and some natives can tools from the bones. This thing is payment enough."

He looked over the monster, "And my daughter?"

I tried, and think succeed, in hiding my pain and fear. That was the reason why I trying to pass on more money. Because the girl dead. Massachusetts Cow-eaters when out for two reasons. Killing competition and hunting more prey. I wasn't deep enough in the woods for the former which meant the girl was already eaten. Which was actually good for me. I caught the damn thing at just right moment to jump it and get it quick. If had gone deeper it could have ambushed me and had we met in the open field it could have prepared itself more. No, luck favors the bold, but luck isn't free.

I walked over to the fence and gestured him to follow. At he fence I explained, "With the Cow-eater dead it's safe enough to form a search party and sweep the woods. Any bears or wolves are gonna be scared away for about a month, but if you don't find in the first day or so, well then..." and I trailed off.

That's when it happened. The man was a tough as nails hard-ass country man, but he wasn't dumb, and he wasn't weak. That's why I didn't tell it straight. If he asked, then I would, but I let him decide how to handle it. Whether to deny, or be hopeful, or just accept it. He was crying.

"Cow eaters will often use dens of other hunters. If you know where the bears or wolves stay you should start there. And they don't eat bones. Just lick them clear, so keep an eye."

He sobbed and nodded his understanding of my words, "Okay."

We stood there as I went over some more details about how the weather was fair and any other dangers would be gone when the door reopened and a women stepped out. "Honey? Honey!?" she called.

He was still sobbing so i turned and yelled, "We're talking about what to do in the morning. He'll be in soon."

She didn't seem to buy it, but went in anyways. The man had lose his child but still had a wife and three other kids he was going to have to be a man for. He needed to get his time, and he was going to have it. I was going to be a stoic rock for him for as long as he needed. Even if it was until morning, and that meat was going to sell good, so it was only fair.

Eventually he made a big stiff and turn to thank me, "Forget about it." I said, "It's literally my job. Feel free to tell your friends about me if you want though."

"I sure will." He hiccuped, "What's your name?"

"Henry Flyring."

"Flyring? Like the circus?"

"Yeah," I answered, "Just like the circus." and I drag my small but well earned fortune away.
