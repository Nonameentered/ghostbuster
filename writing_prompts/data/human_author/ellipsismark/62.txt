The following is a part of the r/worldofdemihumans

The USS Virginian Pride was making its last stand. With over 300 ships under his command Captain Redwood believed they stood a chance against the invaders. Over half of the ship following him would have been shot on sight just a month ago, but enemy of my enemy and common sense quickly led to an alliance across the world. Now they fired in unison against drop ships, flying jets, and space ships that flew into weapon range. The colloquially named Spartan fleet was capable of taking on anything. However the enemy was far from weak. They were going blow for blow. The Earth forces under a single threat didn't hold back. Any and all super weapons were in full development. However, while the entire weight of humanity was capable of facing the invaders, The Horde was simply heavier.

"Mach 5 rail gun fully charged." A sergeant reported, "Target in range and locked."

"Fire!" Captain Redwood ordered a bolt of thunder to launch a 200 pound rod of tungsten straight into the hull of a Horde spaceship. As it began to drop from the sky it fired its own weapon. A plasma beam cut through the sky missing the Virginian Pride but hitting a ship flying a Chinese flag.

"Preparing another round." the sergeant reported, "10 minutes until ready."

"Find me another target." Captain Redwood ordered as his target simply came down to replace the previous one, "Damn it! They just keep coming!"

"Sir, we're getting chatter from the Sun Tzu." A lieutenant reported.

"The Who?"

"The ship that was hit behind."

"Well what are they saying?"

The lieutenant focused his hearing, "I can't tell. It's in Chinese. I'll request a translation."

"See to it." Captain Redwood turned to the intercom, "This is the captain, 9 minutes until the rail gun is ready, prepare for evasive maneuvers."

"Sir the Indians gave a translation. The Sun Tzu is sinking. They're requesting a rescue, sir." The lieutenant reported, "What are your orders?"

"Well we can't just let them drown. Now today at least." Captain Redwood turned the intercom on again, "All staff, prepare to take abroad refugees. Especially anyone who speaks Chinese."

"Sir, The Sun Tzu is moving out of formation at top speeds." the lieutenant reported.

The Captain was about to ask where they were heading, but he could already see. The space ship that had replaced the last one was leaving as had drop one the Horde drop ship. A water vessel loaded with infantry and supplies. The Sun Tzu sped towards it at full speed continual sending lifeboats in its wake. Soon it started to open fire on the Horde drop ship until its run ended by ramming into enemy. Captain learned after the fact that only seven officers were left on the ship. The Captain's last words: We die with honour.

"Mach 5 rail gun fully charged." The sergeant, "No viable targets available, sir."

"Well, find a target. God and all of heaven knows there are plenty around." Captain Redwood, "Lieutenant, report on the refugee."

"Safe and grateful. Apparently their orders were to fall under your command."

"Excellent, find me a ship they would actually be useful. Can't give orders if they don't speak English." Captain Redwood sat in the captain's chair, "Sergeant, target report."

"Still no targets. I'm getting reports from engineering. We've over taxed the nuclear reactor. We're running out of fuels."

"Order a refuel. How many shots do we have left?"

"Don't know, but it's worse than that.  The core is also melting down. Sir, we're leaking radiation." the sergeant turned to the captain, "Two are already dead."

Captain Redwood's face turned grim. "Put me through to engineering. Engineering, come in."

"This is Jenkins. Don't know how long I have. What can I do for you, captain?" The voice of Jenkins came through.

"The core is melting, but we're almost out of fuel. It's this correct?"

"Aye aye. Two men are already dead, and two more are currently dying. I'm trying to stop that from spreading, but my own insides are starting to turn to liquid. Permission to die trying to fix it."

"Hold that. Answer me, if I ran the core dry would that stop the leak?"

"Yes and no. No nuclear fuel means no more production, but the rads that already leak don't go away. If I'm right you're wanting to know that we have three shots left if fired back to back. Charging the fourth will stall us with nothing but diesel jennies."

"Okay, evacuate the core. Save who you can. That's an order." Captain Redwood hung up, "Sergeant, fire the railgun and immediately starting again."

"Sir, can't lock on to-"

"Then take a pot shot. Now! That's an Order!" Thunder rang out. The sergeant reported a complete miss, "Charge it again, and fire as soon as possible. Don't wait for my order. Don't wait for a target. And try to pull as power from the core as possible."

"Sir, I don't mean to question you, but-" the lieutenant had turned to the captain.

"We are using an advanced nuclear reactor. Far more power than any land model. With that comes greater risk. The radiation will cut through any metal. However it's very efficient. It doesn't produce nuclear waste after it's done, but rather a slung of lead. It would take a few hours to repair and refuel, but those men are so cheap."

Eight minutes later the thunder fired another rod into a swarm of fighters managing to hit a few. Ten minutes after that the thunder fired another rod at a drop ship that was out range. It missed. The Mach 5 started to charge again pulling on the core until it gave out. Lights across the ship went out before returning under the power of diesel engines.

"Engineering, status." Captain Redwood called over the intercom.

"This is Jenkins." Jenkins voices wheezed after breath, "Currently in sickbay. Gunners tell me rads are dropping. Chinese engineer even gave a thumbs up. Core is lead."

"Good to hear Jenkins. Status on those dying men."

"Promoted to dead, sir. I'm next in line, sir."

"Negative. I didn't sign off on that, son" Captain Redwood chuckled, "So you better hang on. Is that understood."

Jenkins remained quiet to orders.

"Jenkins, do you copy?" Captain Redwood tried again, but Jenkins didn't reply, "Petty Officer Jenkins. Do you copy? Respond."

"Sir," Another voice came over the radio, "He's gone."

Captain Redwood sank down into his chair and rested his head in his hand. Five of the best men that The United States of America could provide were just gone like that. Has the ship stopped firing at the first sign of leaking issues there wouldn't have be a leaking problem, but of course problems didn't become problems if handle while they were still just issues. The Virginian Pride needed to fire the railgun in hold back The Horde, because they won't stop. Five men die in battle to The Horde. No different to the dozen of jet fighters they managed to shoot down. Arthur Redwood knew this. He didn't feel guilt. Not in the slightest. Nor anger. Only hate. Pure, refined hate for the these invaders who thought they were allowed to have their pale blue dot. Three hours until the refueling and repair would come and be done. Three hours until Captain Redwood could  aim that hate straight at them. Three hours they did have.

"Captain, incoming drop ship. They've launched fighters." The Sergeant reported.

"What? From where?" Captain Redwood jumped to the screen.

"From the south. They just came into weapons ranges when they started to launch."

"Can we counter attack?" Captain Redwood asked

"No one sir. All main weaponry is down. We only have personal weaponry."

"That'll have to due." Captain Redwood spoke over the intercom, "Attention all hands. Enemy fighters are inbound. Find the biggest gun you can and prepare to fire on my command."

The ship scrambled at the armory was emptied of anything. Rocket launchers, machine guns, and even pistols. Anything was pulled to prepare for the ship's last stand, and this was the last stand of the USS Virginian Pride. There were still a hundred Spartans left through the ocean, but none of them could have managed a rescue. They had learned this when they tried to relocate the crew of the Sun Tzu. Now sailors of two enemy nations were about to die side by side. Not as brothers, or as friends. The hate was just too deep for that. They were allies. A coalition of fellow humans fighting against an invader that didn't even deserve to look at the beautiful planet they had ruined.

Before Captain Redwood could call to fire a great wave rocked the ship and threw sailors around. Another ship had lifted from under the sea and began firing cannons. The ship called out over the radio, "Yarr! Greetings Sah Admiral. Dis be Cap'n Jones of the Flyin' Dutchman, reportin' fer duty!"
