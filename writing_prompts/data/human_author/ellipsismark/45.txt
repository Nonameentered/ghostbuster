"The good guy wins and the bad guys lose" was a reference to the TMNT theme song. I was provoking stories like that.

And yeah, people aren't thinking about how moral structures are formed because their bored with "normal morals." Pair that with the idea of "compelling villians" and you get villains are "evil become mom always liked Dave more than me!" Of course get bored of that and move on to "I'm so evil the time police are after me" and then in to "I'm so good time police are after me, to give me a medal" which in turn will loop back to "I'm so evil the time police are after me, to fight an even BIGGER evil!"

People want to subvert what bores them.
