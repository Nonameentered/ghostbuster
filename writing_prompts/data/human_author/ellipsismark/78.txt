The next class of the day was Familiar Training. Every freshman walked out onto a field dozens of rugby fields wide. Manning the field were a dozen teachers including Master Luke, Master Owlsir, and even the teacher Rebecca and Elizabeth just had. Master Luke stepped forward.

"Listen up class." Master Luke started, "To go over the freshman schedule again, Monday will be for knowledge training, Tuesday is for skill training, and Wednesday is for power training. You'll be divided by ranking with null ranks going basic, and upper ranks going to advance. Thursday, Friday, and Saturday are for electives, and Sunday is recognized as a holy day. On Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday after morning classes you'll have Familiar Training. This will be your schedule for the next 9 months. Any questions?"

A few hands were raised. Master Luke looked over them, "Well you're out luck. Let's begin."

Rebecca and Elizabeth were assigned to the Knowledge they just had, Mistress Maryson. Her hair was a cyan color and her eyes were hidden behind coke bottle glasses. Everyone introduced themselves and their familiar. Elizabeth's familiar was an ancient dragon named Sebastian who took the form of a man in suit. Everyone went around introducing mammals, birds, and reptiles. Well everyone except that boy from before. Rebecca saw him kneeling and pointing his rock begging it to do something.

"I'm sorry, but is your familiar a rock?" Rebecca innocently asked.

"No!" The boy answered in a panic, "It's a stone elemental. Ask anyone. They all saw it!" He was on the verge of tears, "Come on Rockstar. Show them."

Rebecca returned to her own group. She whispered, "That boy is-"

"A menace." Finished Elizabeth overhearing Rebecca.

"Oh. Okay." Rebecca remained silent until everyone in her group went. It was then Mistress Maryson looked over her role call.

"Wait a minute. I don't think I have your name on here." She looked over to Rebecca.

"Oh yeah, I was late. I'm Rebecca Tanaka." Explain Rebecca.

"Yes yes, I remember now. You were also late to class today, correct?" Mistress Maryson recalled the morning interruption, "Well show us your familiar."

"Oh. Yes. One second." Rebecca closed her eyes. She reached out into the world the bond she had forged and touched her friend and called, "Shippo."

"Konkon." Was heard around the field a moment before the giant fox landed in front of Rebecca and started to nuzzle her.

Everyone was staring at the house sized fox, "This is Shippo. She's a Kitsune. They're an intelligent spirit from Japan, but Shippo is just a baby still, so-"

"That's a baby?" A student cried out.

"Yeah, she's only a year old." Rebecca answered.

"Well regardless. Training is all the same. Let's begin." Mistress Maryson tried to push through her nerves and continue class. After all, a giant ten ton fox did not undo the need for education.

So it was the class trained to control and commune with their familiars. Some were already incredibly adept like Elizabeth and her Sebastian and others like a blond girl who came in on a horse and a timid girl with an owl seemed to have a firm grasp on their relationship with their familiar. Others, not so much. In fact the most notable was the boy with the rock. He was in a group with the two girls and another boy who was just lying in the grass. Strangely he didn't seem to have a familiar with him. There was the horse and owl with the girls and the rock, or stone elemental, was for the strange boy. Leaving the carefree boy without a familiar.

"Whatâ€™s with that guy?" Rebecca asked Elizabeth, pointing to the carefree boy.

"Danial Weber. He doesn't belong here. Him or his worthless rock." Answered Elizabeth with a hateful glare over to the group, but was clearly mistaken about who Rebecca was asking about. Rebecca was about to clarify when she heard a shout.

"Hey Woodwock!" It was the carefree boy. He was standing and staring at Elizabeth, "Why don't you come get some my wood cock!" He laughed making a rude gesture as he groped his crotch. Elizabeth gritted her teeth in anger.

"Bachelor Armstrong, do not be crass." Master Luke instructed, "And be quiet. Your fellow students need concentration."

"Aye, sir." The boy named Armstrong returned to helping Danial.

"Who is he?" Rebecca asked, pointing to him again.

"That's Damien Armstrong. He went and made friends with the bastard Weber." Elizabeth explained. "That whole click is nothing but annoying."

Rebecca listened to her. Clearly there was something between her and Weber, and while he had a group of friends Elizabeth had no one backing her up. Well she didn't until now at least. Rebecca puffed chest and marched straight up to Damien. "Apologize."

"The fuck?" Damien was caught off guard.

"A-polo-gize. Now." Rebecca stood at her full height of five-eight a whole two inches shorter than Damien.

"No." Damien turned to directly face her.

"Come on Damien, it was really rude." The Danial chimed in.

"I don't care. I'm not apologizing to that bitch. So do something or walk away little girl." Damien had stepped up to be chest to chest with Rebecca.

"Miss Tanaka, Bachelor Armstrong, please cease your bickering." Master Owlsir called out.

Rebecca held her ground and looked him right in the eye, "Fine, I challenge you."

The field snapped into silence. All eyes were on the two students. The other students were wearing expressions of shock while the teachers were clearly annoyed. The silence seemed to last a minute before it was broken by a wave roaring laughter from Damien.

"Oh Sweet Mercy! You can't be serious. You? Challenge me? Get real." Damien was starting to tear up from laughter as he fell into a coughing fit.

"So you concede?" Rebecca stood her ground.

"Fucking hell. You're serious." Damien continued to grin, "Alright then. Let's go."
