They're... details. I mean, what does her being a woman at all have to do with the story? I don't get me wrong, it's a wasted detail. I could have setup a joke for or revisited it to emphasize some other detail, but ultimately Linda(who she is) is a smalled breasted woman who often sleeps in the nude unless she's on her period.

Also, "breast" can refer to individual breast or a set of breast. At least that's how I've always seen it. Although I often seen boobs called almost anything else other than "breast" so many I just don't know the proper grammar.
