"G50. G50." I call out.

"Sir." The knight stood in front of me, his armor gleaming in the lights, "Please, we need your help."

"N45. N45." I read off the ball.

"Bingo." A elderly woman shouted.

"Susan Bellfort with the bingo! Let's go." I shouted as the room clapped.

"Sir!" The knight shouted.

"I'm working right now." I said with more than the heart of winter.

The knight stepped in surprise, "But, The Dark Lord..."

"Has returned. Like *I* said he would." I dropped the bingo balls back in the cage, "but no one wanted to listen to me. I saved the world the first damn thing it does is go back to killing itself."

"Sir, please, my father, my grandfather." The knight stepped in stage and climbed. "They were loyal to you. I'm loyal to you. Please. I had fifty men ready and-"

"FIFTY! You fifty is enough?" I was losing my cool. "I had five thousand the first time and we barely returned with fifty."

"I know, and I'm trying to recruit more and-"

"Why should I?" I asked, "Why should I face that monster again. I came back, learned I was now immortal, and then tried to lead people to better future, but nooooo. People thought I didn't belong it politics. Didn't even give me a salary for saving the world. If it wasn't for my kids opening this nursing home I won't have a job. So why should I bother?"

The knight stared in stock. He face fell and he turned away. He sulled off and out the door.

Joey Smith looked at me and putting his dentures in he asked, "Now why did you yell at boy, Hero? You know you're going to go again."

I sighed, "I know, but I got my pride. Beside, I need to help you get your armor on. You didn't think I going to leave you behind. Did you?"

My lieutenant smiled with false teeth. "Let's roll, Hero."
