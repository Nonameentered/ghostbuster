"Nature persist. Burn a forest, and it will grow back. Block a river, and it will flow around. Kill a man, and his children will march in his stead. Persistent is nature."

"Jessica! You can not keep doing this!" The forest ranger yelled.

"But Greg," The nymph tried to pleaded.

"But Nothing! If the Canadian government finds out that you even tried to do this again they will mark you. You do understand?" Greg the Forest Ranger yelled trying to make the nature bonded bimbo understand the severity of the situation. She was already responsible for two deaths in the last ten years. A third and she would be marked. Meaning government officials would start investing their time and money into killing her. Which Greg won't care if the dumb nymph didn't help keep the eco in check.

"Okay. I understand. But-" Jessica started but Greg cut her off.

"No but!" and stormed off back to his office. A simple cabin in the woods where he could get to easily, but was off the path enough to keep riff raft away. He walked in hanging his hat before looking over to his desk and sighed, "Fuck."

"Howdy there," A Canadian Mountie greeted, "I'm willing to bet you know what I'm here aboot."

"Yeah, listen. I got situation under control. I'm handling it. I got it under control" Greg said smoothy as he could through his nerves.

"Oh do you now? And that's going?" The Mountie leaded forward.

"Well first off the guy didn't even go into the water, so no harm no foul I say. Plus, she didn't even really try, I mean her routine was rather hack if you asked me, so no try no crime." Greg snapped his finger and posed with as much confidence as possible. The Mountie simply tilled his head.

"Right, the rock slide." Greg rubbed the back of his neck, "That was nothing. Just a sliding of rocks. No one got hurt and nothing was destroyed."

"Rock slides can mess up hiking trails." said The Mountie

"Yeah, I'm already working on marking a new trail." Greg responded, "I don't need everyone coming up in here messing with that." To which The Mountie simply leaded back in Greg's chair.

Greg sighed again, "Okay, yeah. There was also the fire but I got it under control. I'm handling things. Okay?"

"Never said you weren't." The Mountie chuckled.

"Wait a minute. You baited me! You ain't got shit on me." Greg pointed his fingered.

The Mountie laughed, "Oh boy, I don't think that really counts as baiting. Truth is I came up here because you haven't been filing reports, but I talked to locals and they say you keep a tight ship. Well, forest."

"Oh." Greg felt like an idiot. "Well, I've been busy see. I haven't had time with everything."

"Oh I believe you." The Mountie had stood up and walked over to slap Greg on the back, "But you got to keep up with your paperwork. So to help we're sending someone who really knows how to handle all that."

"You're... sending me a bureaucrat?" Greg asked unsure of what to make of that.

"You bet, and she's a top notch one too. Well I got my own matter to attend to." and with that The Mountie started out the door.

"Oh sure." Greg followed outside to send him off. After the Mountie had gone a ways he started to think, "She? There sending a chick out here?" Not that Greg thought women couldn't rough it, but Forest Ranger always seemed like a Man's Job. Like him, his father, and his grandfather before. The idea of working of working with a woman was... odd. Unfortunately Greg were interrupted by, coincidentally, a woman running through the woods.

"Help!" she screamed, "My husband saw a girl in the lake. He went to help but now they're both-"

"Sweet Fucking Mercy Jessica!" Greg bolted into the woods to the lake to try and keep this forest under wraps. Just like his father and grandfather before him.
