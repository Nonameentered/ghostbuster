Author Notes: Hey guys, here's a fun fact: Reddit's character counter is fucked. I don't what it is, but it's reading 7,000 characters at 10,000+. Kinda annoying.

So yeah, I went pretty all out with this one. I really loved this prompt, especially since I was able tp add on the same setting as a previous prompt. The "Pet Rock Familiar" if you remember it. I really like this setting and these characters and I'm hoping the develop them even more in the future.
