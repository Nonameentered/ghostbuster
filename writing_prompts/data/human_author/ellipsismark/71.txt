"I guess you would have more than one being a proper English woman. Well let's start with how many sons you have." Tom looked at the clock. They had arrived at 10 in the morning and it was now 2 in the afternoon. Four hours spent to finally get to the meat of the matter, but she was clearly not happy to talk about at least one of her sons. Which was a very good sign.

"I have two sons. My oldest and my youngest, with five girls in between. My Henry was adamant about having at least two boys. My oldest went off to become a lawyer in London. He's married with his own family. My youngest joined the military to try and live up to the old stories we told him as a child." Margaret's eyes shifted into the distance as she recounted.

"Not to insult, but the life of a soldier sounds more interesting than a lawyer. Could tell us more about your younger son?" asked Tom.

Jill, who had spent the last four hours taking fake and real notes, was now perked up. Her goal was in reach. Now to let Tom catch it for her.

"Well... Well I don't like talking about him, or rather I don't like talking about what happened." Margaret seem to become sad in her thoughts.

"And, if I may ask, what did happen?" asked Tom.

"Well, while The Crown's Army was shipping him around Europe he met her." She said her in a dismissive tone. As if she would have rather said it.

"While out of the country, so she wasn't British?" Tom mimicked the same dismissive tone on she.

"No. No she wasn't. My Robert went off with a foreigner, and not even of his own race!" Margaret was in great danger of spilling the tea had made.

"What?" Jill asked absently.

"Yes. If he had shagged up with a German, or a French, or even an African like Junior did I could have tolerated that! But no, he goes and shags a creature that's not even human." Margaret was in a full rant, and was at risk of flying off completely.

"Ma'am, if I may, who did your son, um.. shag?" Tom went directly.

"One of those Russian lizards!" Margaret answered, "Met in combat practice he says. It was love at first sight he says. It's ridiculous."

Jill flew to her feet, "My mother wasn't a lizard."

The room became as fragile as glass as Margaret and Tom stared at her, but unlike Margaret Tom understood what she meant by that.

"Jill, what are you talking about." Tom began to cover, "Ms. Smither, do you have some coffee you could brew? It seems my partner is getting rather tired of our talk."

"Yes, of course." Margaret got and went into the kitchen.

Jill turned to Tom and whispered, "Tom, my mother was a Russian lizard."

"Ludoyashay is what they're called," Tom corrected, "Be respectful, and I'm aware. Considering your lack of scales and all."

"What about the other son. Could he-?"

"No, Margaret said her other son married an African. You're too pale, and-"

"I could take after my father. It's still possible that-"

"And!" Tom whispered as loud as possible, "He happily married London. Face it Jill, we're at a dead end. Nothing to do except abscond."

Jill sunk down in defeat. She thought she was so close. So close to finally finding a solid connection to her mother, and now that she thought about finding a part of her family. She looked at the notes she had taken. All the history of bravery and determination. Of rising to challenge to protect the country, the world, and their family from war and famine. The only lead she really was the fact that her father was a human being from Earth, and she knew that the man was going to have his own life and history. Parents who had parents who had parents in turn. Family. She didn't know if she would ever find her mother or solve the mystery behind her, but if she could find her father, alive or dead, she would have a family.

As Jill was looking over the notes Margaret returned, "It's brewing now. Do you need cream and sugar?"

"Yes ma'am." Tom answered for them, "And we'll just have enough to get us home. I believe we have plenty to work. And do not worry ma'am, we'll spin everything in a positive light. You have my word as an Englishmen." Tom gave a salute.

"Oh yes. Honor is worth more than gold as my father used to say." Margaret smiled at the man.

"Indeed." The fact that Tom was not English or honorable was best left unknown to Ms. Smither.

The two down their coffee and said their goodbye and headed out. The sun had arced the sky and was aiming for the horizon, and being autumn the bright bastard was getting there faster each day. They walked along a paved road that wasn't designed for cars but tolerated the few that passed through.

"I can't believe this was a dead end. After everything." Jill was distraught.

"I can." Tom said as he lit a cigarette, "After all, defeats outnumber victories a million to one, but we'll get there. Someday."

"You really believe that?"

"Yes. Either we'll find your mother, or we'll die, because we're not giving up. Right?" Tom blew a puff into the air.

Jill nodded, "Right." and the two continued. As the duo entered the city limit a bus stop stood. They waited there.

"So, are you finally going to put out?" Tom asked as they waited.

"What? No!" Answered Jill.

"Come on. After all that?" Tom was pleased.

"Deal was you help me find my mother, then I'll sleep with you." Jill reminded him.

"Fine, but whenever we find her, it's go time. Even if we are in front of the whole mystery family. Got it?"

"Oh my god!" Jill laughed, "How can someone so well spoken be so perverted?"

"The well spokenness is a result of the perversion. It's easier to get honey with sweet words, after all." Explained Tom.

"I guess that makes sense." Jill giggled. She did hope that they would find her and soon. She had so many questions, but more importantly she just wanted to know her mother.

As if reading her mind Tom said to her, "We won't give up."
