Author notes: Boy, this was a lot fun. Shame it just got completely ruined by having to deal with reddit glitching out with copy pasta. Seriously, ruined the whole experience for. Anyway, two main criticizes to myself

1. Not enough of the Flying Dutchman to justify the prompt. Got way detracted with the Virginian Pride."
2. Still don't know how to actually write a fight scene. Probably for the better here though. Reddit was a serious pain in my ass while uploading this.

Oh, third criticize, too much lazy shot reverse shot dialogue. need work on that.

Extra note to reader: The plus marks were my work around the reddit taste formatting. I'll be deleting them soon enough.
