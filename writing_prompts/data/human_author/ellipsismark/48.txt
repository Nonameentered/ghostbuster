Cass's response was to wave the scepter overhead leaving a trail of light. She spun in place the scepter creating more light than flew around into the sphere of light showing a shadowed silhouette herself. After her transformation the light disperse to reveal Cass's causal attire was turned into an armor set. Her shirt was now a breastplate, her pants became skirt of metal plates, and her shoes were turned into knee high heeled boots. With the look complete by a tiara and perfect formed gloves that also covered her forearms Cass pointed her specter at the spider lady. "I am Saint Sentai Temper. This is your final warning."

The spider lady hissed and darted down a hallway deeper into the lair. Danforth and Cass ran to the hall to see the spider had disappeared. Danforth turned to Cass, "Saint Sentai What?"

"Temper, as in remaining calm under pressure." Cass said as she started her way down the hall.

"What about under spiders?" Danforth followed.

"Shut up!" The two walked between rows of webbed up computers. They kept their senses open and scanned the between gaps where they could. "I noticed there are no more spiders."

"Yeah. It's weird. Little bastards were all over me earlier." Danforth said pulling on a piece of silk, "What happen with the people?"

"Cut them out and sent them on the their way." Cass answered scanned the area overhead. A network of webs hung over them.

Danforth stopped walking and turned, "Wait, you left them on their own? Defenseless?"

"They had guns and the sense to use them." Cass explained, "After all, only the head spider had a force field."

They looked at each other in silence for moment, not moving, not breathing. Just allowing the silence to carry the sound of distance popping. Danforth bolted, "That bitch!"

"How?" Followed with equal speed, "She ran in the opposite direction."

"You're thinking on feet. You need to be thinking on its feet. Bitch can walk on walls if it wants."

The popping turned into banging as the agents exited the lab area into the hallway proper. They bolted down and around a corner to reveal the spider lady cornering the survivors. Cass leaped forward gathering power in her scepter and hurling an energy blast that blow up on the force field. "Face us coward!"

"Yeah, we gave you chance you ugly bitch!" Danforth pulled another cigarette out and licked the paper making it damp before toss it. The spider lady furrowed her and summon the light wall to stop the cigarette just before it exploded. "Damn. She's learning."

"Indeed. You'll see that your tricks are worthless against- AH!" The spider lady was cut off by Danforth throwing a second cigarette that sailed pass her force field.

"I had a second one ready from the run over here." Danforth said, "But I can't figure why my normal attacks stop cold."

The spider lady launched forward at breakneck speed ramming into Danforth sending him back and before Cass react it slam into her cracking the wall. "That's right, you meal bug. Summon all the fire you want. You won't burn me."

Danforth rolled over to recover his footing. The whole time chuckling, "You're get it. I don't summon fire. I AM Fire!"

Danforth roared at flame engulfed his body. His frame was replace with a bonfire in the same shape. The spider lady stumbled back shocked by the transformation and was pushed further back my the impact of Danforth rocketing forward into the spider lady's force field. It sailed past the elevator that the survivors were using to escape just as the door shut on the batch.

Cass recovered and looked at the burning of her partner. She was awestruck by the fiery form. Two spots in its head glowed white hot against the red and yellow its bulk. The eyes she assumed before the form started flailing arms around. It took her a second to realize that Danforth was signing to her. She quickly started sign as she spoke, "We need to figure out how to-"

Danforth cut her off signing Idiot. I understand fine. I just can't talk like this.

"Oh!" Cass blushed embarrassed, "Right, I can't attack her directly either. How can we put her down?"

My smokes were able to get pass Danforth signed she was also able to turn it on herself. So it must be a reflex.

"If that's the case I have an idea." Cass said, "Ram her again. Full strength!"

Danforth gave a thumb up forward returning his attention to the recovered spider lady as it barreling at them. Danforth rocketed forward leaving Cass behind in flame as she summon music energy around. She reached into the waves of the emotion and found the hearts that sent them. She tapped into the ones in front of her. She couldn't tell the different yet, so tapped both of them and sent a wave of serenity, "Peace To All!"

Just as Danforth made contact with the force field he felt it give way. He passed across the line and into the space of the spider lady. This was where he wanted to be. He wanted to be in arms reach of the thing, but now he didn't want to do anything. Nothing expect find a nice spot in a field and smoke a cigarette with a good beer. He also wanted Mikaelson to come along and start telling one of his nonsense theory about life, but that was never going to happen again. Then the feeling of peace lifted and Danforth exploded into an inferno. Now inside the protective field his theory seemed accurate as it seem the spider lady was pulling the field up despite it being turned into a pressure cooker. The spider lady screamed as its flesh burned, and melted, and boiled. Before long only a black lump remained. Danforth looked at the lump trying to burn it more with just his gaze, but the fight was over. Danforth's fiery form inhale a breath and the flame quickly flickered away leaving Danforth original form on the exhale. Danforth reached into his coat and pulled out another cigarette. Lighting it with a ginger.

"Oh thank god, you're not naked." Cass said walking, "I thought for sure that fire form burned your clothes away."

"It use to, but then now all my clothes are magically made to changed with me. Pockets include. You would be amazed how many ciggies I lost in my rookie years."

The agents called into HQ as they rode the elevator up. By the time they got outside black vans were surround the building and even a helicopter circle overhead. The majority of the scientist were still in shock as Ironworth stepped out of a car and addressed them.

"Attention." His smile was paired with a chirp tone, "I am happy to say that the situation is currently under control. Agents are going down to recover any remaining survivors, and you all will be taken to a hospital for full check ups. Of course it goes without saying that you all are also under arrest. You still have full entitlement to all your rights, but you all are hereby detained. Thank you for your understanding."

Ironworth scanned the crowd. They were mixed relief and a new fear of legality. Of course Ironworth was actually looking for the agents who had taken a seat to the side of the crowd. Walking up he looked Danforth over.

"You do know retirement was a viable option, right?" Ironworth asked causing Danforth laughed.

"Retire? At my age?" Danforth blew out a smoke cloud, "I'm too old to let brats like Cass here have all the fun. Worked too hard to let the good times me up."

"Yeah well good job all the same." Ironworth said turning back to the building, "This is going to be a massive pain in my ass, but I can't really blame you two, now can I."

Danforth puffed another as Ironworth saluted them and walked off. Cass looked over to her partner smoking like a chimney. "I don't get how to smoke those. Aren't EBG the worst?"

"Sure, but I'm been smoking sense I was three?"

"Really?"

"No. But I did buy my own first pack on the day I turned twenty-one. So I am use to them." Danforth looked over, "Now tell me something, why does your magic armor leave so much exposed?"

"What?" Cass was still in her Sentai Saint armor, "Oh no, it's still fully protects me, see."

Cass pulled out one of the knife they had gotten back and stabbed it into her midriff over for the blade to stop at her skin. Danforth nodded with impress, "I see. Still don't know why it shows so much skin, but hey, armor is armor."

"Can I ask you about your demitype?" Cass asked.

"I'm an elemental being. I am a body of living fire. Nothing much to it. What about you? What the hell is a Sentai Saint?"

"Oh, well basically we were a team tasked with protecting the Earth, but I'm the only one left. The rest... They went to living normal lives."

"You mean mundane lives." Danforth corrected, "We demi humans are just as normal as them. Just more exciting."

"Yeah, sure. If it's not too much, can I ask you about your partner's powers?"

"I don't know anything about them."

"You didn't know your partner's powers?"

"How can I? We've only been one mission together," Danforth jabbed Cass lightly on the shoulder, "Partner. Now my old partner. That jerk could take in energy and focus into the precise attacks. We had this combo attack where I blast with all my fire and he turn into a plasma beam. It cut through almost anything."

"How did he die?"

Danforth pulled the last puff off the cigarette before dropping it and stepping on it, "It's my turn, remember? There's something that been bugging me just lastly. This morning. How did you guess I took my coffee cream and sugar."

"Oh that? I didn't really. I just got two orders, one black and one cream and sugar, and which ever on you took and kept the other."

"Wait, you're saying that you downed an entire cup of straight black. With even flinching?"

"Yeah. I have more than one sleeping night fighting against Void Empire."

Danforth laughed and started his way to his car, "Come on Rookie. Let's head on home. We got a lot of work ahead of us."
