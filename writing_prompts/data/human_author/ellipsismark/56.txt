"I can't catch a break." Linda said to herself as she opened the window, "Come on in." She went to her and pulled a bathrobe out and cover almost naked body. Her breast weren't big enough to justify a bra at night, and she was on her cycle. Another inconvenience of the moment. "So what's the deal?"

"I want to file an official complaint with the Nature Preservation Society of New Jersey. " The mothman said shaking glittery dust out itself.

"Otherside beings can't file civil cases. And if this group is a government establishment then you're more likely to get Otherside Affairs involved than get any results." Linda had made her way to the kitchen and produced two glass of wine. She offered one to mothman.

Taking the glass and sipping it mothman added, "I'm filling with the backing of a human organization."

Linda sighed so deeply her soul almost left her body. Yeah, a human group could basically loaned their rights to an Otherside being if they had valid justification, but the whole process was a massive pain. She knew all to well being she was one of the best lawyers that handled fairy issues, even though she herself was mundane. "What organization and on what grounds?"

"The History Preservation Society of New Jersey. We wish to stop the destruction of a lighthouse."

Linda's face twisted into a scowl and all her weariness evaporated away from the anger in her stomach. She pointed back to window, "Get the fuck out of my house!"

"But, i need you help."

"Are they in the phonebook? The History Society i mean." Linda asked, "can I find them in the book?" The mothman nodded but couldn't say anything as linda cut him off, "Good. I with call them in the morning. Now out."

Linda nearly threw the moth out the window and closed it. Throwing her robe on the floor and returning to her paradise of a bed Linda was still bitter that she had been woken up to keep a lamp on. "I can't catch a break."

Author notes: short and sweet. Might edit later. With sleep now.
