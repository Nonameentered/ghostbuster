Author notes: Boy, this was fun, and may revisit Danial Weber II and his attention to New World Academy.

Of course, I will answer any questions about the world and/or characters.

This would need alot of editing and reediting were I try and punished this. There are a lot part I either rushed through or just skipped to save time and characters, but I still whined need 4 posts to post all of it. but I guess that's about right. This took about four good "Writing sessions" to get it all down. And I likely would have needed 5 or 6 if I actually wrote the fight between Elizabeth and Danny. But I like it.

Remember: If you write a page a day, You'll have a novel in a year.
