"I am literally one of the top combatants on High School circuit." Razputin growled through his razor teeth.

"And I got the high score on tetris down at the arcade. What's your point?" Melissa countered as she tapped buttons on the beeping console she held.

"I could get you at 300 yards before you even saw me!" Raz slapped his scaly chest.

"Yeah! I know about guns. I'm not impressed." Melissa kept on tapped paying the 8 foot tall lizard-like alien boy as little mind as possible. 

"I know more about fighting than you know about tying your shoes."

"Well I only know the one way, so that doesn't say much."

Raz was huffing as he stretched out to his full bulk. He started another boasting before getting cut off by the under 5 foot girl. 

"Vlad! Get your dumb brother to leave us alone!"

"Yeah, come on Raz." A smaller lizard-like boy tried to get the larger one to clam down.

"Quiet Vladimir!" Razputin barked at his brother before turning back the human girl. "You think just because you're mundane that your safe from my wrath?"

"Nah, I think I'm safe because I'm sure deep down in your heart, that macho act and russian accent, you're just a huge pussy." Melissa continued to stare at the hand-held game.

Razputin's tale snapped his tail on the ground and roared out, "You little brat! I'm going to-"

But Class J never did learn want he was going to do to Melissa as at that time the class room door opened and entered Mr. Galacto. "I'm back class. I would like to thank Mr. Ivanov for- what's going on here?"

Mr. Galacto surveyed the class only be answered by a booping sound and Melissa crying out in disappointment, "Aww man! I was so close."

Raz slammed a palm on a desk before turning his bulk to front of the class and towards the exit. Mr. Galacto went on, "Right, well thanks to Mr. Ivanov for watching the class while I stepped out."

In the hallway stood Vice Principal Thompson, "Good morning, Raz. Anything to report from Class J?"

"Da. That mundane girl." Raz strided down the hallway as the vice principal joined him.

"You mean Melissa Odinson?"

"Da. She has guts of a real hero." Raz smiled, "More than I've seen from grown men."

"Yes, she is impressive." Vice Principal Thomas agreed, "Wish she would put more into her studies."

Raz waved away his comment, "Ba! Strong head is all you need in this world. I'm glad she in same class as Vladimir. He needs good role models."

Vice Principal Thompson sighed as he shook his head, but still he smiled. After all, the boy was right. There was no point in arguing. 

Author notes: a popped this out on mobile. I'm trying to get back into my writings. Details to know: Razputin Ivanov and his younger brother Vladimir Ivanov are members of a lizard-like alien race called ludoyashay that crashed landed on earth over a century ago. Raz a Russian accent. Vlad does not. Both can speak Russian. That's the only important details I can think of.
