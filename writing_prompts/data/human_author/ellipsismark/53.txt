I don't necessarily agree with that. Not every factoid is another round for chekhov. I feel it's just character building. After all I'm describing covering herself because she's naked. But why is she naked. Well because she sleeps in the nude, but how to say that without just saying that?

Again, I've them called yams more often than breasts. I'll just make on that.

I do thank you for feedback. I'm just wanting to make sure you're noting the right things.
