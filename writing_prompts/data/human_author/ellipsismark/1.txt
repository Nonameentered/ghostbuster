Listen. You have to understand. At some point you learn to stop asking questions. Conveniently it's around the same time you figure out what the deal is.

The letter came like that rest. About two moments after i check the mail. I don't even answer the phone. I just let it ring as I head back out to the mailbox I just emptied. The phone stops just as a open the hatch. No point in telling me to do what I just did. Just one envelope. With just three words. "Just For You."

I go back inside. Nobody asks any questions anymore. Makes me wonder if they figured it out yet. I light a cigarette and open the letter. It's addressed to "Dear Sir" and opens with "You will go to the market." That's how they all are. Not as commands, but just statements of facts. Like they weren't actually telling what to do, but rather informing me what I'm going to. Of course then it goes into the extra details.

I'm going to go the market. The new one that the local farmer union open this year. I'll shop around. I'll begin whenever I want, but I will be done by a set time. I'll be sure to gather a load of cargo that can be secured in two heavy duty paper grocery bags to near maximum capacity and I will process to the only checkout lane without a line to have my items bagged. Do not worry about payment.

That last line was a right slap. A direct order as opposed to the prophetic declaration of the rest before it. After it list of suggestions for my shopping trip if I need ideas for what to get. Milk, eggs, standard stuff. Then at the bottom: Ciggy Snap Gum.

The letter looked like it was written in a typewriter. Each letter a perfect stamping a neat row. The only deviation was the one i in the gum brand design to help smokers quit smoking was dotted with a fucking heart. Bastards. 

I took an extra long drag as I made a note to myself to update my last will. Bury me with two cartons of Top Notch Red Longs. Don't worry about matches. Just make sure the first one lit before you lower down. Whatever. I got shopping to.

Ain't much to say when it comes to shopping. Or maybe there's too much to say, and everyone just keeps their mouth shut because they know better. Point is I did my rounds through the aisles of the Farmer Union Market. Everything is either local brand or Top Notch. Except the booze aisle. They had both Platinum Pride and EBG products in the aisle. As if they had a choice to sell alcohol without including the Pretentious Punkass or Easily Brought Garbage roster of various piss waters. Forgot it. It's time.

I set of my selection on the check out. The cashier beeps them over and stuffs them into two heavy duty paper bags. The cashier looks like a young woman. I think she might actually be a young woman. Sounds like a young woman when she wishes me a good day, but I didn't actually pay attention. I too be busy worry about this part. This was always the most nerve racking part of. The end part. The final of line. Just under the heart dotted joke from my employer was one more sentence. A direct order. "Figure it out from there."

I think for a moment. Do I have anything else to do? Anyone to visit? Messages to deliver? Appointments to attend? No to all. So I have no reason to not head straight home. So I guess I'll do that. I head straight home with one heavy duty paper bag filled to the brim.

Then I got hit by a car.

Not to say someone drove into me in a car. Rather a car was for some reason launched into the air and impacted me board side. My groceries I didn't pay off flew in every direction and I in one direction with the car into a fuel station. From good fortunate I survived. From bad fortunate was stuck in a growing puddle of gasoline. I coughed and watched as my forgotten lit cigarette felt from my mouth into the gasoline. It was extinguished. I guess being flammable didn't guarantee ignition. 

Of course my relief ended with a source of ignition came from elsewhere. I thought for a moment. I could possibly wiggle out before the fire got me, but this was probably the thing to figure out. If a escaped that was that, and the letter say that would be thag. It said figure it out.

And so I called for help working off a theory. I was about give up and worm my way out when all the pressure on was lifted away. I looked to see a figure lifting the broken pump for me crawl out of. And i did. The figure turned out to a boy. A young boy. A strong boy. I figured out the real job then.

"Thank you. You saved my life." I said and watched the first hit of the heroism in his eyes.

"It was nothing." He said.

"Expect my whole life. Thank you." I reach out a hand. He takes it. We shake.

"Sorry to run, but I got to go stop the guy who threw that car." And like that a hero was born. Well maybe. This wasn't the first near death I had. It wouldn't be the first failure I had. This being in the right place at the right time stuff is hard after all. There were a lot of questions to ask, but inconveniently it's around the time you start figuring things out when you just stop asking them.

Whatever. I need a smoke.
