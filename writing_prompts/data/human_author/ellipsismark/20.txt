Quickie:

"Avenge Oog. Avenge Oog."

You sigh and down the tylenol with a Johnny Carson. You couldn't be mad. After all the landlord paid you to live here specific to be the target of this haunting. And hey, you took the check every month, and would gladly take the lifetime payment for managing to get the spirit to move on. Unfortunately, you have no idea how to even begin getting revenge on the concept of fire itself. 

"Avenge Oog. Avenge Oog."

You sigh and prepare another Johnny Carson. 

Fin.
