Editing. 

The word hung in his mind like the fruit that had tempted Adam and Eve. Could he really play god with Naomi’s life?

He hit a menu button, pushing the sound of her screams out of his mind, and explored the submenu for the edit function. There were categories like “personality”, “motivation”, and “appearance”. 

She had always complained about her forehead. Tim justified his little experiment by telling himself that he would give her exactly what she had always wanted. A new look. 

He pressed the button… and nothing happened. 

He flipped the camera over in frustration, trying to find some button that would make it work. But as he had the lens facing him, he slipped and caught the camera in mid-air, pushing the photo button. 

The next thing he knew, he was inside a white room with nothing but  his friend Naomi, and a window into the real world. 

“What is going on, Tim?” she asked, her lips quivering.

“I don’t really know. I guess we have to wait for someone to come rescue us.”

Time seemed to drag on in the unchanging world of the white room. Until, at last, they both watched in horror as a janitor scooped up the camera and dumped it in a trash bin.
