#A Step Into The Future

Thuk crept up on a deer with practiced accuracy. He leapt at the last moment, arms outstretched, and with a sharp stone. The deer stepped aside and continued munching on some grass. 

“Daaaaaadddd,” Dulk said, “why don’t you use what I showed you?”

“Because, I don’t like it.” 

“It’s nothing to be afraid of. It’s called an arrowhead. Other tribes and the far away cities have been using them for generations already.”

“I don’t like how you kids come here with your new technology from distant lands. I know how to get food. It takes a few days, but I *will* get a deer.” 

“What if I told you you could move some of the forest aside with the new tools and grow food from the ground?”

“What? That’s nonsense. We have deer and we have berry plants sometimes. That’s always been good enough for me.”

“Why would we keep spending our lives gathering the same things the same ways? We barely have enough to eat.”

Thuk huffed. “Soon you will want me to go to those far away lands and get some of their bronze things too! It never ends with you young folks, you can’t enjoy a simple life.”

“It’s just consolidation of some food plants in a local area. Nothing to worry about. And everyone is already doing it!”

“Not everyone! I saw that old Barkut still hunts the old way. You know… before he died.”

This was the start, Thuk knew it. They would argue again, back and forth, about the new technologies and the feud would last for ages. 

“Alright,” he relented, “show me this new arrowhead thing.”

Dulk lit up. He smiled, showing all four teeth, as he grabbed a stick with some twine attached to it. 

“You place the arrow on this thing called a bow.”

“I thought it was an arrowhead.”

“It is, but it’s on an arrow.” 

“Well why didn’t you call it that in the first place?”

Dulk was pinching the bridge of his nose as he let out a sigh. 

“Okay, don’t worry about what it’s called. Now, you turn the arrow the other way… no, you have it backwards… the other way… no, it has to be perpendicular to the bow.”

“See! You use big words and then confuse me with your instructions!”

“It's fine. I’m sorry I got upset. Not just turn the arrow around and put it on the bow.”

“Like this?” 

“No, um, turn it… off… okay, and now on again.”

“I did that.”

“I’m confident you didn’t.”

“Well I don’t–”

“Here, let me help you.”

Thuk watched in amazement as his son attached the ‘arrow’ to the ‘bow’ and then pulled the twine, releasing the arrow across the forest. 

“Amazing!” Thuk clapped his hands. 

“And I have plans to move some of the forest with other tools and grow some plants.”

“I don’t know about all that.”

“Dad, not everything needs to be an epic struggle against the wilderness. We can harness some of it and make use of it.”

Thuk looked down at the dirt, he was feeling lost. 

“I guess I’m just not able to keep up with all of these changes.”

Dulk put an arm around him and they walked back to the family cave. Thuk knew other villages were living in man-made houses and had all of the new technologies, but he liked his simple ways. 

“Dad?” Dulk’s voice called in the darkness as they lay in their furs, ready to sleep. 

“Yes, son?”

“I do appreciate you, even though we argue, I still respect you.” 

Thuk waited for him to fall asleep, then lit a fire and started to work.

When Dulk awoke, he looked around, only to find his father staring at him with excitement twinkling in his eyes. 

“Come look, Dulk. I made something for you.”

Both men walked closer to the cave entrance. Thuk pointed at the wall. 

It was a beautiful painting of a man hunting deer with a bow. An arrow stuck out of one of the deer and another man was cheering in the background. 

“It’s you, and me!” Thuk exclaimed. 

Dulk threw his arms around his father and they embraced for a long time, both men holding back tears. 

“I know we will eventually move out of the cave and live in a modern house. But this will always be here for us. A memory of a son and his old-fashioned father.”

“His wonderful and wise father,” Dulk corrected, as they walked into the dawning daylight.
