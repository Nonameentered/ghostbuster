Godwin awoke with a start. He was in the enchanted forest, and that stunningly beautiful creature was sitting on a stump, drinking tea and watching him. 

“My… Lady?” 

“You may call me that.” The most eloquent and harmonious voice he has ever heard floated to his ears from the ruby red lips of the woman in front of him. She was unusual, in a sense, her legs seemed to reach into the earth like roots. Her body was waving gently in the breeze, her arms even more so. And her face…

Her face was like the most radiant flower. A rose in full bloom was only an imitation of the perfect beauty he beheld in her face. 

“You. You are the flower?”

“I am both the object of your quest and your affection, Godwin.” She looked at him knowingly. 

He sat for a while, until it all made sense. 

“You’re the princess!” 

“I am.”

And you’re the precious flower in the woods!”

“I am.”

And you’re the witch that guards it!”

“I am.” 

“So… why am I still alive? Was I not under your spell?”

“I had you caught and bound, yes. But I must admit, I do not want to see you dead.”

Godwin smiled, hoping that she was not just interested in sparing his life, but in the possibility of more. He sheepishly asked, “Have you spared me for any particular reason?”

“I know that you seek my favour as your princess.”

I most certainly do, Your Highness.”

“Well, I do love a man who is good at calligraphy.” 

And so they got to know one another and eventually lived happily ever after.
