# Training

WC 187

The process was repeated.

An old man poked me with a wilted finger.

"Wake up." His harsh tone was that of an instructor.

I peeled myself off of the cot I was sleeping on. It felt like I had been sleeping for ages. Come to think of it, how long was it since my last meal? I was famished.

"This time," the man said, "keep it down!"

He shoved a pared durian fruit into my lap with a spoon sticking out of the flesh.

"Eat."

I was pining for something hearty, a rich stew or something with some meat in it. But it didn't seem like I had options. I scooped out the putrid smelling stuff and brought it to my lips.

The old man was distracted, talking into a device on his wrist.

"It keeps them going, although they do have the original's tastebuds so it's a chore to feed them."

I looked up when I had finished my so-called meal.

"Alright, that's enough for a week I'd think." he said, then he pushed something like a stick into my skin and I started to go unconscious.

The process was repeated.
