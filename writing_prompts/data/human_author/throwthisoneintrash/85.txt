#A Refuge

WC 474

***

I don’t remember when I first saw it. An image in my mind solidified from the haze of dreams and became the refuge I ran to in my darkest hours. 

When middle school bullies pushed me to tears, I would come home, and sneak out back to find rest in the translucent halls. I’d climb the staircase and look out on the world from above. The problems down below seemed insignificant, all blending together in a meaningless rattle of people and things. 

Every time I returned back down to the world, I felt like stepping into mud and mire. I’d wade through life’s caustic waves and dream of being back among the clouds. 

I retreated there often when Chance died too. I couldn’t seem to climb high enough to out-distance the pain, but at least I was away from the things that gave me more. 

I needed to flee often through my teenage years, and yet there weren’t enough stairs to bring me high enough to feel that carefree sensation I remembered having when I first found relief in my hiding place. 

It was like the world was growing larger, or maybe something else?

Maybe invisible lookouts up high in the sky were not enough to get me through everything life had to throw at me? 

I remember when I was five hundred feet in the sky, looking down at the little houses and cars that made up my street. But now I was barely twenty feet up, I couldn’t get any higher now. I looked into my window on the second storey and saw a movie poster. 

I walked back down, sighing with each heavy step, and flopped down onto my bed. Maybe it was time to try something else. 

I called Carla, I hadn’t talked to her in ages. 

“Hey Carla.”

“Hey Jen,” she said. 

“I guess we haven’t talked in a while, but…” I noticed a drop of sweat trickle down my face as I breathed in the courage to continue. “Do you wanna see a movie or something with me?” 

“Yeah. Let’s do that. Honestly, I was feeling kinda lonely. I wouldn’t mind hanging out.” 

Something sparked in my mind. An energy I didn’t remember having before. I ran out the door and spent the evening with my friend. 

“I was feeling down, you know. I’m glad you called, Jen.” 

“Yeah. Me too.”

We became close over the next few months, barriers broke down in my mind that I had built between myself and the rest of the world. 

I don’t know if the translucent hideaway remained outside of my bedroom window. I don’t even know if it had ever existed or if I had just imagined retreating up above the world. 

But I do know that it's easier to get through the mud and the mire with a friend.
