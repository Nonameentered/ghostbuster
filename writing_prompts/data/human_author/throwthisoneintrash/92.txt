#Robbery in Oldstowne

WC 799

***

The three-pronged saguaro cactus stared Silas down. 

“You yeller-bellied, good-fer nothin’ plant!” he yelled as lightning fast fingers danced down his side and found the holster. 

“Pop pop,” he said, wincing away a bead of sweat that found its way into his eye. It wasn’t worth wasting bullets on practice, not with the robbery that morning. Yet Silas couldn’t sleep. The dusty desert dried up any possibility of rest. He strode over to the only horse his crew had between them. 

Old Glum stared Silas down too. He was a loyal horse, something akin to a friend. But Glum didn’t do too well around gunshots, so it didn’t matter if he slept or not. He would be resting, while the crew hit the General Bank in Oldstowne. 

Bella, Silas’ girl, lay asleep like an angel in their torn-up tent. She almost smiled as her fluttering eyes took her to the land of dreams. Even Mikey, the plucky young boy they had taken under their wing, was snoring softly in his own tent. It was just Silas whose nerves wouldn’t let him sleep. 

As sunlight peeked over the edge of the world, Silas mock-fired again at the saguaro. He was a competent gunslinger when he needed to be.

His thoughts were interrupted by a gentle hand on his shoulder.

“I don’t think the cactus will attack.” 

Bella’s hazel eyes opened wide with the kind of laughter that only comes out between folks that have known each other a long while. The edges of her lips curled upward and he realized again that he loved her. 

“Hope you got enough rest,” he said. 

“With a big strong cowboy like you to protect me? Why, I slept like a baby.” She smirked. They both knew she was the better shot and it should have been Silas who felt protected. But in the empty desert, nothing short of a rattler would disturb them. He lowered his shoulders and breathed in. 

“I guess it’s time. ‘Bout an hour to Oldstowne on foot.”

“I’ll get the boy.” 

After finding a shaded spot for Glum to stay, the three of them sauntered into town, looking like any other travelers down on their luck. Anyone who didn’t have a keen eye would overlook them in an instant. The guns were tucked away under layers of cloth, and they all hung their heads for the full effect. 

Once inside the bank, Silas cleared his throat and stepped up to a teller.

“Me and the missus want to make a withdrawal.” 

The teller looked back in disgust. 

“Am I not speakin’ clearly?” he said, “I came here to withdraw some cash.” 

A manager waddled over from his desk in the back. He looked Silas up and down and then harrumphed and waddled back. 

“I suppose he wasn’t clear, was he?” Bella stepped up to the counter. “We are here to Make. A. Withdrawal!” 

She revealed the six-shooter she had under her blouse and Silas pulled out his too. The teller gasped and raised her arms. Every eye was on them now. 

A shot rang out…

Both Silas and Bella swung around to see three men in the doorway, one of them holding a gun trained on Mikey. Another held a smoking gun in the air. 

“Now I thought you three were suspicious the moment you slithered into my town,” the one with the silver badge said. 

Silas calculated the angles, the timing, the opportunity. It was a lost situation. There was no way of getting a clean shot without endangering Mikey. He looked over and saw Bella come to the same conclusion. They dropped their guns and raised their arms. 

“That’s more like it,” silver-badge said, “Now y’all are coming with me. Since there’s no judge in town, I’ll have to decide your punishments myself.” 

Silas caught him making a devious look at Bella. He gritted his teeth. 

Back out on the street, being led by the armed men, Mikey began to sob. 

“It’s not over yet,” Bella said to him.

“Sure it is, Ma’am. We ain’t got no hope left.” 

“You’re a good kid, Mikey.” Silas said, “You just have to trust us a little longer.” 

The three men laughed. It did look hopeless. But then Silas whistled. 

A faint thumping sound came from where they had camped the night before. It grew louder and louder until old Glum was seen, charging down the street.

“Stray horse! Stray horse!” one of the other two men yelled.

Glum tore down the street and reared his front legs high into the air. With a couple of ka-thumps, he pounded the lawmen into the dirt. 

“Good boy!” Silas patted the beautiful animal’s snout. 

“The best member of our crew,” Bella agreed, as they swung around and walked back into the bank.
