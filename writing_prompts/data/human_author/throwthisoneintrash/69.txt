The next day, a messenger pounded on the great doors of the Rose Kingdom’s outer walls. 

“Who goes there?”

“I am a messenger from the Violet Keep. We seek peace.”

The guards atop the watchtowers looked at each other with stunned faces. The Keep had been in rebellion ever since they stole the Ring of Roses. With its power, they could defend their land against the Kingdom of Roses. Something must have happened, for otherwise they would not humble themselves to seek peace. 

“We will relay your message to the king. Now go!” they shouted. 

The Prince of Roses watched as his father summoned an army the likes of which had not been seen in a hundred years. He was going to go to war against the Violet Keep just because he thought they were now weak. 

He was right, but also, very wrong. 

Word spread to the Violet Keep and the Violet King also prepared for war. 

The two armies met in the field between the kingdoms, while the prince waited in a watchtower. He knew his beloved princess was also waiting back in her keep. 

With the power of the ring, he raised his arm and called fire down from the heavens. All of the warring soldiers and the two kings melted before the torrential flames. 

Soon, he walked among the charred remains of men and horses, weeping for the loss. But an arm wrapped in violet silk held him tight. 

The Prince and Princess wept for their foolish, hateful families, and vowed to begin again in peace and love.
