#What If…

Stainless steel conveyors ushered chocolate squares from the mixing station to the distribution unit. Metallic arms squirted even layers of chocolate atop the custard and crumble beneath. Soulless, soundless machines whisked perfectly proportioned pieces of delectable delights from start to finish with a symphony of silence. 

Joyce leaned on her cart as she lazily pushed herself and the cart through the sea of products on display at Honest Ed’s Grocery. She eyed a bright package of desserts that promised to take her away to a land of bliss with each bite. She picked it up and looked through the plastic layer. As she pondered purchasing this new delicacy from Canada, she hesitated for a moment.

The automated purchase correction machines whirred into action. A tray extended down from the ceiling with a platter. On that platter was a stack of nanaimo bars, the very ones she was considering purchasing. She shrugged and took a bite-sized piece, popping it into her mouth. It was a fairly new experience for her. The rich custard, coconut, chocolate flavours all blended together beautifully. The only problem was, it was too sweet! She shook her head at the machine.

Another arm extended from the ceiling, proffering two coupons for 90% off the purchase of her second box of nanaimo bars. 

Joyce looked around at the other customers. They were all in a similarly dreary state, pushing carts and minds through the routine of shopping. With chocolate still dripping down her fingers, she grabbed two boxes of treats and rushed for the front of the store. 

A mindless person moved in front of her, blocking her from the till. She wanted to say something mean, but her words came out differently.

“I’m sorry, go ahead, sir,” she said. 

The other shopper looked up from his daze and smiled. Joyce had never seen anything like it.

On her way home, she found herself waving to other drivers with a cheesy grin on her face. What was happening to her? 

At home, instead of scrolling through her phone, she turned on the tv, searching for a hockey game. It didn’t feel unnatural or strange. It was simply the new her. She stood and shouted when a game came on, and although it was a little league competition, she whooped and hollered with every point and cursed the referee at every opportunity. 

She stood up to get a nanaimo bar from the fridge, but when she opened the door, she was shocked to find out that she was out of maple syrup. She drove to the store in a mad panic, only enough time for a dozen “sorry’s” and twenty or so waves to the neighbours. 

Back at the grocery store, she smiled at every shopper, earning smiles in return. The lights seemed brighter, and the shelves seemed cleaner as she passed. 

Not finding her coveted maple syrup, she smiled at the helpful robots and said “it’s okay” when they offered high fructose corn syrup alternatives. She left the store and scoured the town for real maple syrup.

Observers of the phenomenon later said that she brought a new sense of purpose and love to their streets. Smiles and friendly encounters began spreading like wildfire. 

Yet some people didn’t like the change. 

The very manufacturers who had built the machinery to produce the Canadian confection were now upset that the society they had created was not mindlessly purchasing products, but was instead finding joy in the simple things of life. Soon a task force was created to take down this invasive new person. 

As Joyce walked through town, naturally spreading love and happiness, a gang of ruffians stood in her path looking as menacing as they knew how. Joyce’s smile had almost faltered when a man with an eyepatch pulled up in between them.

“Here,” he said, tossing her a shield with a maple leaf in the centre. She raised the shield and faced her opponents, blocking fists, bullets, and nasty glares with it. When she was done, the man with the eyepatch strode over to her.

“I’m Nick Fury, and I’d like you to join a new initiative I am starting.”

“What’s that?” she asked with a smile. 

“It’s called the Avengers, a collection of earth’s mightiest heroes.”

“But I’m not a hero.”

“No, you aren’t,” he said. 

There was a second of silence as Joyce waited for his next words. 

Fury sighed. “But I need someone to boost the damn morale of the Avengers team, and I think you can do it.” 

Joyce happily agreed, and was from then on referred to as Captain Canada.
