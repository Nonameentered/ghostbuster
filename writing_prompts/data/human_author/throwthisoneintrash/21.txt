Hey there!   


I noticed that your section of the story was well over 300 words. Try to shave it down to around 300 words for this feature. You can use [wordcounter.net](https://wordcounter.net) to check on your word count. 

I love what you have come up with, and I know how hard it is to trim down your writing, but I am confident that you will be able to get the main parts of your vision into 300 words. It will leave room for someone else to come along and finish up the story! 

Thank you for writing!
