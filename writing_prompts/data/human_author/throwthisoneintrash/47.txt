Experimentally, Ted rolled the watch back to where it was. He glanced in the mirror to see the grey hairs disappearing and his face growing smoother. 

A watch that could change the age of whoever held it. His eyes widened as he thought about the possibilities. He could be eternally young. He could test it out on plants to grow food in an instant. The possibilities he envisioned filled his mind with excitement. 

There was only one problem. The man with the gun. 

Thinking quickly, he handed the watch back to the thug. 

“You will need to wind it to make it work. You see the date?”

The thug nodded. 

“Wind it from 1954 to today’s date.”

He spun the dial with gusto, setting the gun down on the table. Ted waited. In a matter of seconds the thug was a wizened old man, probably over a hundred years old. 

Ted snatched the watch from his hands, taking the gun, and walking out the door. 

“Enjoy the rest of your life, old man,” he said. “I’ve got a world to change.”
