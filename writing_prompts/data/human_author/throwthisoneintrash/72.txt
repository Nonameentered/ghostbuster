<3/3>

Being a queen doesn’t sound all that bad, and it seems like I will be protecting Joan by agreeing to it. 

“Alright,” I say, “whatever It is you want, I’ll do it.”

The forest shivers. The vines that wrap Joan in a suspended hammock twist and turn, lowering her to the ground with surprising grace. She lays asleep on the glowing roses. 

I run over to her, kneeling beside her quiet body, and check to make sure she’s okay. 

“Dear Rose, come now, let her awake. Your soul is forest-bound. The bright green road your feet will take, leads you to your great crown.”

I nod sadly, now fraught with care, but crown and throne await. And so I float within the air, down towards a vine-y gate. 

I feel myself, now one with trees and rocks and hills and streams, find melody in spoken words and songs in thoughts and dreams. 

The crown’s not one made out of gold, but made of newfound joy. The throne’s not one of metal cold, but from the Forest’s ploy. 

The trap is one to set me free, from human toil and woes. My life now echoes of the green and of the bright red rose.
