“Take a break, Callie.” My brother enters the room and sits on the bench beside me. His thin fingers folding on his lap. 

I look into his eyes despite the blur of tears in my own. He seems genuinely caring and concerned. 

“Do you remember when you had Mrs. Fullsworth?” I ask. 

He leans forward and, in response, plays chopsticks on the piano. It pulls a smile from my dripping face. 

“The first song we both learned,” I say. I sob slightly, but reach for the keys, playing along with him an octave higher. 

“She gave us so much,” he says, pausing to look at me. “But you don’t have to do everything perfectly to honor her.”

“I know. I just wanted to make her proud.”

“You always did.”

My brat of a brother transforms into a bulwark of strength and comfort as he reaches his arm around me in an embrace. 

He was right. Mrs. Fullsworth would want me to be confident in myself.

I don’t have to get any better for that. 

I already am enough.
