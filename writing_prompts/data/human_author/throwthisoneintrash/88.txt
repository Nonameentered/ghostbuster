#Detour into Adventure

WC 709

***

Now when you think of daring and epic stories, you might not consider that a young man such as myself would get himself caught up in such tales. But today was a day like no other. 

When I had started on my way from home, I heard the piercing cry of a woman in distress. Not one to shirk responsibility, I followed the sound down a cramped alley and into an old, musty building. It was dark inside, yet I could make out thick clouds of dust which rose from the ground. Beneath the unsettled dust, footprints led me through the halls toward where I assumed the cry had come from. 

The footprints stopped at a dead end. I searched for clues and soon discovered a latch off to one side, indistinguishable from the rest of the decrepit walls. It took a keen eye to spot. 

Lifting the latch, a segment of the wall swung out and then, lo and behold, I was inside of a richly carpeted entryway. A huge chandelier hung above an ornately decorated room, larger than any I had seen before. A staircase was on either side, white railings with luxurious finials and pillars tastefully spaced along it. Suits of armour stood on the lower level facing inward, as if on guard against intruders. 

The cries were muffled now, yet I heard them again, coming from the top of the staircases. 

I borrowed a sword from one of the suits of armour. The stoic chap didn’t seem to mind, after all, adventure called! 

I charged up the stairs in what must have looked like the most gallant display of heroism you would have ever had the chance to witness. 

Sure enough, a bearded man, with missing teeth and an eye patch, stood facing me. A gagged and crying woman lay tied up on the floor. 

“I see you favour the finer weapons,” he barked, raising a sword of his own. 

I took my position, sword raised in answer. He lunged forward, assuming I would not be able to parry. 

With a swish, I knocked his advancing steel aside and danced away from the blade. He was embarrassingly exposed and so I waited for him to regain his footing. 

Once squared off again, we traded swipes for a few more rounds. He tried to land a blow with increasing fervour. I realized that I must give him a duel of some length for him to retain his honour. We fought for several minutes, until I could stand the thought of this poor woman waiting for my rescue no longer. 

I swung my blade in an arc, effortlessly skirting his block and landing flat side against his shoulder. The man looked up at me, pleading for me to spare his neck. I nodded graciously while the man dropped his weapon and ran. 

The woman gave a muffled cheer as I turned toward her. Soon I had unbound her. She looked up at me with a bright smile and joyful eyes. 

I listened as she explained to me that she was one of the last fairies on earth. She was constantly pursued by those darker elements who would use her powers for evil. 

Fairies can grant men the ability to fly or the ability to travel from one place to another instantly. I laughed as I told her how this detour had taken me far away from my destination. 

“Where would you like to go?” she asked. 

“I should go to school, but it will look too suspicious if I suddenly appear there. Why don’t you bring me home and I can start the journey again, even though I will be very late.” 

“It is done.” 

I cannot tell you the sensation of whisking through the world instantaneously by the power of a fairy. It was something only they could do and I felt a sense of awe as I knew I was one of the few people to have ever experienced it. 

I began my journey to school again, from my house, at nine o’clock in the morning. All because of my desire to take the adventure before me and rescue this incredible and rare person. 

So… um… that’s why I’m late for class, Mrs. Beladere.
