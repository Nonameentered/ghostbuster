Chase, 

Get oat milk and chips
- Randy

–

Screw you. I’m going out tonight. 

–

Chase, 

I'm away for three days. You need to take care of yourself. And I do expect there to be oat milk at least for my cereal when I’m back.
- Randy

–

Nah, dawg. I don’t drink that shit. 

–

Chase,  

There’s no harm in just getting a little oat milk when you’re out, is there? I’ve picked up many things for you.
- Randy

–

You just think you’re better than me and can boss me around. I’m not picking up shit.

–

Chase,  

You are frustrating me. I am going out on my bike and I expect you to have cleaned up your dishes by the time I’m back.
- Randy

–

I went out for smokes.

–

Chase,  

I missed you again, but this has to stop. I can’t take your sloppy lifestyle any further. Please do something. I’m at my wit’s end.
- Randy

–

You think you’re better than me. Ciclicaling to the store and drinking your oat milk? You ain’t shit.

–

Chase,  

It’s “cycling”, and it's good for you.
- Randy

–

Fuck you, nerd. 

–

Chase,  

I have brought you your favourite snack and I do not see you. Did you storm off again?
- Randy

–

Randy,  

You have just missed me as I was experiencing impulsive urges to go smoke in a rather seedy part of town. 
- Chase

Chase,   

I would rather you not put yourself in such danger. There have been stabbings out there. You must be diligent.

Dear Landlord,  

It is with great sadness that I regretfully inform you that Chase has passed away. It seems that he has let his nefarious habits get the better of him. I am confident that the mutilated body on the news will be identified as his.  

I have a detailed series of notes passed between us which will help any police investigation that may arise from the incident.  

I, unfortunately, must travel to Mexico for work. I will be back within three weeks. Please do not let anyone into the apartment without first texting me.
- Randy
