Whether it was the motionless husk of the watch, or the intensity of the situation, something made Ted feel like time had stood still. 

He reached for a brass-head jewelry hammer and struck the thug in the temple. He dropped instantly and Ted almost did too from shock. 

A split second decision had saved his life and the adrenaline coursing through him gave him the strength to move the body behind a desk before opening the door. He had no idea why he opened it. 

Standing there, in robes as black as night and carrying a scythe taller than the door frame, was a skeletal figure without eyes. Yet it still seemed to look at Ted with a chilling glare. 

“Ted?” The raspy voice that came out of the hollow face was chilling enough to freeze the air. “Why are you alive?”

“I… uh… what?”

“I was sent to claim your soul. But now I see you have exchanged your fate for that of another.”

“I d-don’t know what you mean.”

The figure stepped into the room and the colour seemed to drain out of everything. 

“Ahh.” It said, seeing the thug’s body. 

“I will visit you again, Ted. But today you have changed your fate.” 

The inky blackness left with the figure and Ted stood alone in his shop; with a dead body, a watch, and the million-dollar diamond that fell out of it.
