#Odyca's Challenge

WC 592

***

Hrowta leaned forward and blinked at his computer screen. Nothing was coming to him. The tightly packed array of pixels streamed a steady image of a blank, white page into his irises for what seemed like days.

“Aaaahh! Why would Odyca push me to such a grueling task?” he moaned. 

Despairing, Hrowta left the computer chair and lay down on his couch, hoping a reverie would come and take him away from the dark cloud that hung over his head. It wasn’t fair. Leaving things to the last minute was his right as a writer. It’s not like planning ahead ever helped anyone.

Squinting his eyes shut, he tried his best to find the illusory land of dreams. One where verdant fields of flowers replaced schedules and keyboards. One where foxes were nice to cheetahs and didn’t subject them to writing about tropes. It was a futile attempt, but at least it was some form of procrastination. Normally he would clean the house, shop for groceries, go to work, anything to avoid writing. But this time, he tried to dream and couldn’t. 

“I don’t accept the world as it is,” he muttered, trying to tempt fate to suck him into an imaginary world to teach him a lesson or something. It didn’t work. 

Luckily, the doorbell rang. 

“Hello, Hrowta,” a cheerful smile said, “I’m your childhood friend.”

Hrowta hung his head after hearing the greeting. Perhaps he was in a dream already, and the author of said dream didn’t have the ability to separate narration from dialogue. He debated with himself whether it was better to be in a poorly written dream or to not be in one at all. 

He shrugged and let the childhood friend inside. It was the least he could do. 

“I, your childhood friend, think that you should give the writing challenge another try.”

“Did I tell you about that or are you just a convenient—”

“It’s worth it. You will get loads of practice.”

“I dunno.”

“Say this with me: *I am deliberate and afraid of nothing.*”

“What?”

Say it. Say that exact sentence block.”

“You don’t get more points for doing it twice, you know.”

“Come on, you have to build your confidence, Hrowta. Otherwise it will crumble.”

“My dear childhood friend. Please leave.” 

The two of them exchanged good byes and Hrowta looked back at his apartment. He had a decision to make. He could either go back to the couch and try to dream away his problems, or he could go back to the computer desk and try to write a story.

The dilemma was too much. His mind wheeled back and forth in the endless battle that all story writers face. To procrastinate or not to procrastinate.

“I mean, that’s not even a question.” 

He looked up at the cuckoo clock in his living room and realized that he had a whole thirty minutes to go! It was plenty of time to relax and maybe think of a story idea.

Or maybe he would just talk about food on Discord. Odyca wouldn’t know anyway. How could the last minute ramblings of an author be any different than a well plotted and edited story? Hrowta laughed at the idea of planning. When had anything ever been solved by thinking ahead? 

He took a detour into the kitchen for a snack, only to realize that he hadn’t bought any groceries in the past two weeks.

Then he turned, faced the fourth wall, and said, “This isn’t a lesson or anything.” 

Then he woke up.
