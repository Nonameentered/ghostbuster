This was excellent! I loved the flow of emotions we get an insight into with the main character. As always, you have a tightly-packed story with momentum and meaning in every word.

The only thing that caught my eye was this phrase:

>Despite years of lack of use, my heart twisted.

It is a powerful line and I think it could pop a bit more if you cut "years of" from it. Something like: 

>Despite its lack of use, my heart twisted.

That might keep the focus on the heart twisting instead of having too much to parse to get to that sweet gut-punch of a line. But this is a very small thing, and pretty subjective. You just didn't leave a lot to crit!
