WC 100

It was a wrong number that started it, the telephone ringing three times in the dead of night, and the voice on the other end asking for someone he was not.  

“No more bloviating,” Argyle replied, “my journal awaits on the typewriter, then I’m off to sleep.”  

“Please, I am arriving from Columbia, needing a place to stay.”  

Everything can change at any moment, suddenly and forever.  

“Fine, stay with me. It is not a fragrant world outside of the airport.”  

He was obligated to help the random caller. No way has yet been invented to say goodbye to them.
