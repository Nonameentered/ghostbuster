#The Factory Next Door

WC 481

***

Pappy always held my hand when I was little and pointed up at the building with the chimneys.

“Stay out of there, Claira-Belle, it's dangerous,” he’d say. 

That sense of awe never left me as I grew up under the shadows of the old factory chimneys. They was practically spires from a picture of an old castle now that the rain had wore them away some. 

You’d think the antiquated charm of a relic from olden times would have been a blessin’ for our little town, but it turned into the opposite. Word started spreadin’ like wildfire about something that dwelled there in the inner recesses of the rust and steel. 

They said it carried an ax, swinging at anyone who trespassed. And I heard about how it growled at ya. While the Laughlan boys bragged about how they saw it chase them down with a lead pipe one time. They was liars from their mamma’s womb, but still, the stories had to mean somethin’. 

I thought about them stories a bit, but my life was too busy now that Pappy had passed. I had a whole farm to run. Despite being next door to the old factory, I didn’t have the time nor the energy to put into frightenin’ myself. I just lived beside the old beast and I figured the so-called victims of the creature hidden inside deserved a mite of dyspathy. 

Besides, I had been inside. ‘Tweren’t nothing to be afraid of. 

Once you get past the decay of the outer shell, it’s more or less just some empty rooms. I wasn’t silly though. If I needed to go in there to keep trespassers from gettin’ onto my property from that way, I would do it with caution.

I kept my choppin’ ax near the factory entrance on the farm’s side, just in case i needed to shoo away one of them thieving types. I’d give ‘em a loud hollar and hopefully get them to think twice about it.  

There was one time I heard someone in there and, creature or not, I had to get them to back away. So I did what any normal person would do. I ran into the old building and grabbed some lead pipe I found lying around and chased ‘em off with it. It was probably better for them anyway. I had never seen no creature there, but I wouldn’t want them to get ate by one. 

For the most part though, I lived peacefully beside the old factory. As much as darkness loomed over everything, and I could see why folks came up with these wild stories, it never did bother me none. I was happy to live in my Pappy’s old house. A serious house on serious earth, he’d called it. Not at all like these fanciful stories about a creature in the factory that probably didn’t even exist.
