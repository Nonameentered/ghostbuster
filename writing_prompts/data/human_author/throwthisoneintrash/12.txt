#Long Ranch

WC 758

***
Sometimes you need to scorch everything to the ground and start over. Take a burning stick from the campfire and ride your horse through town, burnin’ up the place. 

I almost did at Long Ranch. 

Those wispy willows at the edge of town made the place seem almost civil, like it weren’t a pit of vipers, lying in wait. I could feel the venom in the air the moment I set foot in that cursed place.

Looking to immigrate out west, I packed everything I owned into saddle bags and dragged Dancer, my old farm horse, through the desert by offering him a little grain from my dwindling supplies. I decided it was gettin’ to be time I settled down, when I spied Long Ranch over the hill.

A quaint little town, shaker roofs and boardwalks that fit so beautifully against the vermillion sky of evening. I kicked the rust off my spurs and strode into the saloon upon my arrival in the evening.

Now, I had no problem bein’ the underdog in a fight. But seven great big whisky dogs spun around on their barstools and challenged me like I had insulted their mothers. I didn’t like to run, but I also didn’t like to get my face rearranged without knowing why.

Luck took a shine on me then, and the barkeep hollered out after them.

“I have an interest in the outsider.” It was all he said, but those growling men settled down and let him approach me.

“What can I do for you?” I asked, my eyes never left his. 

“We are in need of a lawman around here. Are you up for the job?”

“I ain’t no lawman.”

“Not yet, no. But if you like money, then you just do what I say and you’ll see plenty of it. Just keep the peace, *my peace*, and we’ll get along just fine.”

“So this ain’t about justice really is it?” I noticed the stacks of moonshine in the corner of the room, guarded by an armed man.

“You’re observant,” he said with a smirk, “welcome to town, Sheriff.”

I’m ashamed to say I played my part. I didn’t mind gettin’ paid to look the other way while the real boss of the town did his business. Although it did bother my conscience some. 

I had to do some minor things to make it seem like I knew a thing or two about keeping the peace. Old Mrs. Downstead had me to her place often enough to check on this thing or that. I didn’t have the heart to tell her she wasn’t missing all of the things she thought she was. She was just gettin’ to that age of forgetfulness. Which is why I didn’t take her seriously at first.

“Sheriff, you must come see something at the farm.”

I saddled Dancer up and rode out to the estate, only to be greeted by the quieter folk from the town.

“We need to speak with you, Sheriff,” Mr. Glumb said. “The town ain't right the way it is. We don’t want to be a mob-run distillery. We want to have farms and families. We don’t feel safe with the likes of the Saloon Crew around.” 

I set my eyes on them and squinted as I recounted my time in this town. It was the saloon owner himself who had hired me. Mr. Bank, everyone called him, but I wasn’t sure that was his name.

“Look,” I said, steeling my voice to sound more sure than I was. “There's nothing that can be done. The only thing I can say is… it’s a wide open country. Have you thought about settlin’ out near the mountains?” 

They scoffed. I heard a few of them mutter things like “sold to them” and “false sheriff”. It was almost enough. Almost the right words at the right time to pull heroism out of my achin’ heart. But it wasn’t. 

I wished I could have told them that this was the best my life had ever been. I’d been down many dark paths, that’s why I set out to the West. Every time you find something that doesn’t work, you’re a step closer to what does work. Isn’t that right? 

My uncle, Clarence, said he was haunted by the ghosts of the things he’d done in the past. Well, I envied him. I wish the evil I had done was all in the past. Mine lived with me, it was my neighbors, my friends, my boss. I am haunted by humans.
