I looked at Amy as she marched beside me to the planting site. I wanted to apologize. I wanted to tell her I wasn’t trying to seduce her so that I could use her in my mission. I really did think she was someone special.  

The hill at the centre of our compound looked bare, as if it had always waited for the rose. A gathering crowd stepped into the evening air and surrounded me as I dug through the hardened earth. 

We were safe, behind our silver fence. Safe from the werewolves that hunted us. But safety was not freedom. We had all decided that we wanted to be rid of the curse. To become mortal again and simply live at peace. 

As I finished digging, I turned back to Amy and asked her for the rose. She hesitated. 

“I want to know what it’s like,” she said.

“That’s highly un–“

“Please. It will only be a few minutes before you plant the rose and heal us all. Please, turn me.” 

“I looked out over anxious faces and stern glances from my companions. But I couldn’t resist her pleading eyes. 

“Alright,” I said, as I bit into her neck slowly. I stopped and wiped her blood as soon as possible to reduce the smell. Already, some of my companions were licking their lips. 

Amy looked up at me, Her eyes already glowing, her teeth sharpening. 

“So, that’s what it’s like,” I said. 

“It’s… wonderful. I feel ten times more alive.” 

“Yes, it does feel that way at first. Now please, hand me the rose.”

“No.”

“Amy!”

“I like this. I feel so powerful!”

And with those words, she destroyed the rose, and our last chance of becoming mortal again.
