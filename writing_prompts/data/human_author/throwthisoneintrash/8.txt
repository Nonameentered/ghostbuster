Captain’s log 436f73

I’ve elongated the crew’s circadian cycles due to the immense distances between points of interest this far out in space. First mate Ruthers complained that it was a violation of the order of nature to make days and nights stretch on so long. 

I, however, found the change to be refreshing. Breaking up the monotony of twenty-four hour days seems a good thing to me, although it does affect my ability to dictate these log entries at regular intervals. Yet I will be diligent to not let the new schedule interfere with consistent data analysis. We are, after all, exploring uncharted territory.

An unusual sense of dread has come over the crew and it’s manifesting itself as a sullen demeanor. I normally don’t make such broad accusations, but it is quite apparent. 

In light of the obvious developments among the crew and, admittedly, my own mental state, I have called a meeting of the officers. We may have to resort back to a regular circadian cycle, much to my chagrin.

I can only assume we are passing through an undetected cloud of gases as the views from all windows and monitors have a yellowish tinge to them. 

While this, and the demeanor of the crew, seemed like good topics to discuss at our officer’s meeting, we were instead entertaining fantastical theories. 

Ruthers himself started saying that we were reaching into a void of space which was unknowable and should be forbidden. To my shock, several officers nodded their agreement. I tried to reel them back into reality but the effort required seemed monumental. I let them babble as I left.
