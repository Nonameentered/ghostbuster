Jessica bit hey lower lip, a habit she has picked up when she was anxious. 

*I’m dead? Not only dead, but going to an interview in the afterlife?*

She tried to think about what could be ahead of her, despite the overwhelming sense of dread surrounding her. She knew about the Egyptian myth of weighing the heart against a feather or something. But that seemed ridiculous now. 

“Please sit at this desk.” Her guide led her to an office desk with computer. “Now, please type up a brief summary of your education and experience.”

She has written resumes before so the task didn’t seem too daunting. It took some time, but she came up with one she liked. 

“Now what?”

“Now please fill all of that information in this questionnaire on our website.”

“But I just wrote it all in the summary.”

“Nonetheless, please enter it here as well.”

Jessica went through the process, meticulously entering each detail. There was a security section where she had to identify all of the parts of a picture with road signs. Once compete, she hit submit. 

“Hey, it says there was an error with my submission?” 

“Please enter your information again,” the pale stranger said. 

“But it’s all in my resume!” she complained. 

No response. 

“Oh no.” A thought came to her. “This isn’t purgatory.”

The cloak slipped off of the stranger. Beneath the hood were horns and a devilish grin. 

“You’re right, Jessica. Welcome to hell!”
