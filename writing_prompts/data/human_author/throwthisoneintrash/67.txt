“No one changes the world, who isn’t obsessed.  
So hurry, Clarissa, come down and get dressed.  
You’ve plans to save all the world today,  
So step up to it now and join in the fray.  
  
“The terrible wizard has trapped all mankind,  
So abscond from this house and put him in line.  
Your inheritance from ancient prophecy states:  
‘Clarissa will win, it’s the will of the Fates.’”  
  
With one look at her trainer, who pushed her to breaking,  
She slumped to the kitchen, found food for the taking.  
Today was the day for a terrible duel.  
So she started to make up some tasty fuel.   
  
Pancakes and waffles, bacon and eggs,  
All greedily gobbled, even the dregs.   
Then a light bit of travel, to a palace unknown.  
She felt rather chilly, right down to the bone.  
  
The wizard himself came and stood quite near.  
A disarming smile as he said, “Hello, dear.  
I’ve been meaning to talk to you one day,  
For I have so very much I’ve needed to say.”  
  
“You see, we’re related, you’re my daughter, of course,  
So why don’t we stop this before there’s remorse?”  
“Your daughter,” she thought, her face quite withdrawn,  
“So that’s why you greet me, out here on your lawn?”  
  
“I want you to share in this power of mine.  
I want you to have all that makes me divine.”  
“I think I might join you, if that is the case,  
I’m not interested in being invisible, erased.”  
  
So the two walked together into the great castle,  
Neither thought the duel was worth all the hassle.   
It was much better to work together, you see.  
For now Clarissa had her sweet victory.
