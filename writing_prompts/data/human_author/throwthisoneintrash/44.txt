It’s chest rising and falling, the creature truly was alive. Perfect eyes met his own. An exquisite hand reached out. 

He took it. He held the hand of his creation and the creases on his face reformed into a smile. 

“You are beauty incarnate. You are perfection of our species.” He stood in awe, not noticing his creation reaching for a scalpel on a nearby table. 

Flexing its strong jaw, the creature muttered something. He leaned in to listen, anxious to hear the words.  

He had accomplished so much. The work and toil seemed like nothing now that he had built perfection. He would study it, determine if it had a soul. He had so many plans, so much more to explore now that he knew he was right. 

The mumbling words became more clear. 

“Nawt ddddeeee…”

It was learning quickly. He encouraged it to try speaking again. 

“Nnnot dead th-th-th…”

“Yes!” He exclaimed in response, “you are not dead!”

“N-not dead things, but living.” it said. 

With a twist of its powerful arm, the creature sliced off his hand. Pain of body, heart and mind enveloped him as he slumped to the floor. 

The creature took his hand and lay it gently on the table. Then, with uncaring expediency, it broke the doctor’s neck and left to find more parts.  

It chanted a revised form of the doctrine. 

*Tear the flesh, crack the bones, only from the new.*
