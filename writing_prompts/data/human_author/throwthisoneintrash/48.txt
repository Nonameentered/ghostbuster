We both looked at each other as the childish innocence melted from her face. It was happening again. The same thing that had happened to me was happening to her now.

“Will I be okay?”

“Yes, you will be powerful. You will change the course of history.” I sighed. “But you will be lonely.”

“But I have you, Momma.”

“Yes, Baby. Now and forever. I’ll always be your Momma.” 

I pulled her in tight to my chest and kissed the top of her head.
