#A Fresh Start

Dylan counted the steps on his route. 

One. 

Two. 

Three. 

The first stop was a stainless steel dome in the conservatory’s lower level, tilted just slightly at an angle to soak up the brilliance of the sun’s warmth. The illuminated panel displayed humidity, temperature, oxygen, and nitrogen levels. His worn hands grasped an equally worn pen as he wrote down the readings in his journal. 

It was his favorite pen. He’d refilled the ink dozens of times over the many centuries of his tenure. He wasn’t really that old, but this planet spun so fast that one ‘year’ felt like a blink of his eyes. He sighed and moved on to the next domed pod. 

Four. 

Five. 

Six. 

The sun had looked hazy through the murky atmosphere of the planet. It wasn’t an ideal climate when they had first landed. If Dylan and his crew hadn’t brought their technological advancements to this world each of the specimens in the pods would have gone extinct. He was their caretaker, in a sense, and he smiled through creased, blue lips thinking about how fortunate his timing was. Finding this planet and its creatures just in time to save them was a stroke of luck. 

Seven. 

Eight. 

Nine. 

Another stainless steel dome, more readings, another three steps. 

He continued through the multiple levels of the conservatory, doting over each creature in a motherly way. They all looked the same to him at first, but gradually he was able to tell them apart. Slight variations in colour, size, and age were apparent with careful study. While the rest of his crew worked on making the planet habitable again, his job was to care for the livestock. 

He was supposed to raise the creatures as a source of food for the journey back home, so he made sure that he didn’t get too attached to them. 

Seventy-two. 

Seventy-three.

Seventy-four. 

The end of his march brought him to the top of the conservatory. He loved the view from there. As the atmosphere was scrubbed, his view of the stars became more and more clear. He poured himself a drink, set his journal on a side table, and squatted on all eights to view the increasingly beautiful skyscape. Machinery hummed in the background and his thoughts brought him back to his journey through the emptiness of space. 

Perhaps it was the loneliness of space that made him feel so attached to the pathetic and dying creatures. Despite having the rest of the crew to talk to, the vastness of space and the incredible amount of time it took to travel to the destination planet made him quieter and more reserved than usual. 

The new creatures were a breath of new life. Their frail state made him feel protective of them. Each one was so helpless, writhing without protection in their dying atmosphere. He was their savior, their benevolent god. 

The entryway door opened and closed. Ryan must have finished his work and was returning to spend the evening at the conservatory. He liked it almost as much as Dylan did. 

“How was the atmosphere today?” he asked, trying to make Ryan feel appreciated for his efforts. 

“Almost done, I think.”

“Do you think they will be ready?” Dylan raised three arms and pointed at the steel domes. 

Ryan surveyed the rows of pods reaching out and brushing a tentacle gently over the nearest one. 

“I know how you feel about them, Dylan,” he said, “and I can respect your concern, but we’ve talked about this. We need food for the journey back home.”

“I know. But… I’ve grown attached.”

Sadness made his glands glow a deep shade of purple as he hung his head. 

“I’ve talked about it with the others, and we think we can ration carefully enough to leave a breeding pair behind. We are cleaning up their atmosphere after all.”

“So, it’s not just for a future colony?” Dylan’s glands returned to a healthy shade of yellow. “You actually want them to thrive again?”

Ryan smiled and nodded. 

Dylan was so happy he twirled around, tentacles and arms flapping with joy. 

“I’ll choose the very best ones!”

“That’s great because we already have a spot picked out for them to start their new life. Bring your best two pods and we’ll wake them up in the garden.”

“Oh!” Dylan exclaimed, “I bet it’s a lovely place.”

That night Dylan recorded his exuberant thoughts in the journal. Despite its scientific nature, the journal was the way he had become accustomed to expressing his emotions. It felt natural to write how he felt in the old journal. 

In the morning, he chose a male from Pod A and a female from Pod E. He waited anxiously outside the conservatory for Ryan and the others to arrive. 

“Ready?” Ryan asked. 

“Ready.” Dylan beamed with excitement. 

The garden they had prepared truly was exquisite. He pushed the two pods close together and took a deep breath before releasing the latches that held them shut. 

First the male. 

“Pod A? I think I’ll call you Adam,”  he said to the male. 

Adam blinked in the sunlight, a cool breeze pulling on the hair atop his head. They were beautiful creatures, in an odd sort of way. 

Then he turned to the other pod. 

“Pod E. I’ll call you Eve.” 

The pair stood in the midst of the garden prepared for them. Dylan smiled and stared, transfixed by the moment he had been looking forward to for a very long time. 

“Stay here,” he instructed them. “Don’t leave this nice garden yet. Your atmosphere is still being cleaned.”

Adam pointed at one of the atmospheric detoxification towers with a quizzical look on his face. 

“No. Don’t touch that… um… tree. It’s forbidden.”

Eve pointed at the red bags of toxins collected from the atmosphere. The contaminated air was held in those small bags before it was processed. Dylan tried to think of ways to describe the contraption to the simple humans. 

“Those red things are the tree’s fruit. Please don’t touch them. If you touch them you will die.”

With that final warning, and a tearful goodbye, Dylan left the planet with the rest of his crew. He looked back through a window at the wonderful little ecosystem they had rebuilt. 

They would come back in a hundred thousand years or so, but until then, the little creatures would have to survive on their own.
