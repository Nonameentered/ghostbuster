#Marley's Carol

WC 747 

***

Marley lay down to sleep after a day filled with spreadsheets, reports, and bad traffic. He only had a few moments while at home to briefly spend with his young family before sleep took him. 

In his dreams, his old business partner, Ebenezer, stood at his doorway. Thick chains of Hawaiian luau flowers adorned his neck and he laughed happily.

“Marley, listen to me. Three ghosts will visit you, and tell you of the error of your ways.”

“Uh, hello Scrooge, this is highly irregular.”

“Shhh, don’t interrupt me. I’m here to warn you. Three ghosts will visit you this night and tell you everything.”

With that, he disappeared into the shadows, laughing merrily. 

##The Ghost of Opportunity Past

A glowing head emerged from the wall and spoke to Marley.

“Come with me.”

The ghost led him outside and into the rain. It was tax season and through the window, they saw a younger version of Marley.

“Thirty-eight divided by twenty-seven…” Young Marley was doing his taxes.

“Why are we here, Spirit?” 

“Look at what you did next.”

They both peered in through the window and saw young Marley recheck his math. He had forgotten to carry a three in his division. The emanation of pride beamed off of him as he corrected his math, causing him to have to pay an extra one hundred dollars to the government.

“You see the problem?”

“Yeah, but I had fixed it.”

“No, you fool! Dangerous things are paid for with poor choices! You should have made it look like an honest mistake and then claimed a lower tax rate.” The ghost looked exasperated.

Soon the image washed away like a castle of sand and Marley was left alone in his current office.

##The Ghost of Opportunity Present 

A plump ghost stood before him as Marley reacquainted himself with his surroundings. The office was just as he had left it the day before. 

“Maaaaarrlleeeeeyyy,” the ghost wailed. 

“Uh, yeah?”

“Look around you. Do you see the success you had dreamed of?” 

“Well, no. But I found something better; I have a family, and a nice boss, and—”

“No! No you do not. You see failure. You see a decoupage of what your real life could be. Ever since you filled out that tax form honestly, you have been making decisions that have only made you a kind-hearted person. Why here is your desk, in the middle of this pickle-barrel of an office when you could have been in charge of something great!”

“Well, what could I have done differently?”

“Cheat, Marley. Lie, Marley. Anything to avoid this depressing life.”

“But I like my life.”

“You won’t like where it’s headed! By my prognostication, you will find out just how much you have lost when the next ghost visits you!” 

##The Ghost of Opportunity Future

A cloaked figure with a scythe stood before Marley and the office disappeared. He was whisked away to his home, with friends and family gathered around. They were all older than Marley remembered them being. In the middle, sat an elderly version of himself, with a birthday hat on.

“Happy Birthday to you!” the crowd sang. Future Marley smiled. 

“This doesn’t look so bad, Spirit! I like what I see.” 

The cloaked figure merely pointed at a young girl sneaking up to the cake on a table behind Future Marley.

“Surpwise!” she shouted, as she dug her hands into the cake and raised them into the air. Bits of cake rained down from above, like a shower of delicious, frosted confetti. The adults laughed and then Marley’s son scolded the girl. She must have been his granddaughter.

“You see?” the raspy voice of the cloaked figure said. “These are the horrors that await you if you live a life by-the-book. You could be somewhere else, on a yacht or something.” 

Marley glared at the scene in front of him. Two thoughts waged war in his mind. Would he ignore the warnings of the spirits and his old partner? Or would he change his ways and become the cheating, lying cynic he was always meant to be.

“I *hate* messes. Especially sugary, sticky cake-related messes!” Marley shouted. He looked back at the spirit. "Can I ever change?"

"It's not too late, Marley. There is time."

With that, he was whisked back to bed.

In the morning, he awoke with a new sense of purpose. He vowed from that day forward to be just a little bit meaner.
