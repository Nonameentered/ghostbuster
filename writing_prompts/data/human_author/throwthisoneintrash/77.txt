#Chosen of the Dark

WC 799

***

My whole life, the dark prophecy loomed over my head like an axe held by the smallest string. The burden of it made every interaction, every moment, a push towards the inevitable. 

I would one day defeat the Prince of Light. 

It all started when the Mage arrived in my village. He was like a pit of blackness, swallowing the very light of day. His black cloak swooped as he descended from his horse and strode with powerful steps in my direction.

“You are the chosen one!” he proclaimed. “You will defeat the Light and bring Darkness back to our land.” 

Nothing changed for a while. But fate held me fast in those years. I developed an interest in swordplay. Master Letern agreed to train me as if I was a city guard, but I soon outpaced the rest of the guards, so he sent me to the Light Tower to learn from the swordmasters. 

Arriving among the hateful blaze of their white uniforms and shining steel reminded me of their oppression. The Prince of Light moved into our world seven hundred years ago, and had oppressed our people with his spells and sorcery. The few dark mages left in the world were scattered far and wide. No one stood up to the beacon of light that was the Bright Castle. No one dared to vex him. 

But when I saw his insignia on the breastplates of these soldiers, I grit my teeth. A radiant sun on every piece of armor and above every entrance. I cursed under my breath every time I was greeted with “the Light be with you”. 

No one stood for the Dark anymore. No one except for a handful of misfits I met while training. They saw me muttering as I walked away from the captain of our troop, cursing the Light. They pulled me aside into the coolness of a dark alley and asked if I served the Dark. I nodded reluctantly. Each of them smiled and nodded too. We became fast friends. 

Yet I wasn’t prepared to do anything about it until I had another visit in the night from the Mage. Before I realized he was at the Light Tower, he was at my bedside, urging me to meet him in the training square.

“The Mage of the Dark I met back in my village?”

“It is I, young man. Tell me, do you feel ready to defeat the Prince of Light?”

“I know that isn’t possible. The prophecy must be wrong.”

“I am not young enough to know everything. I simply trust the prophecy and have come to offer my services.”

“You mean… teach me magic?”

“You can have all of the power of darkness at your disposal if you are willing to learn.”

I looked across the square and noticed my friends watching us.

“It seems you will have friends to accompany you. Gather your things and meet me at the slopes of Mount Noire. 

We all bolted to our rooms to gather our meager belongings and escape. A guard stood in our way and we were just about ready to draw our swords when I saw the Mage ahead of us on his black stallion. He lifted his arm, muttered some words, and the guard fell fast asleep. My jaw dropped as I shuffled out of the Tower and onto the road. 

The Mage brought us through a winding path that led deep into the mountains. There, we saw a field of purple flowers, glistening with the night’s dew. It was lavender.

“I thought this was all outlawed.” I said.

“It is,” the Mage said. “Yet we grow it still. It is the fuel of dark magic.”

For the next year, I practiced dark magic and black spells with the Mage. He never once told me who he was, claiming that the Dark Ones do not use names. He did, however, tell me of his past.

“I studied every tome there was, and soon learned of the prophecy. I wanted to tell someone else, but no one I knew would listen. They were too afraid of the power of the light. I finally reached the point where I knew I had to become involved or shut up.” 

I knew it was no coincidence that he found me.  

With the training I obtained at the Light Tower, and the instruction I received in the lavender fields, I felt ready to approach my foe. The nemesis of all mankind. The Prince of Light.

So that is why I stand before you today, nameless. I stand here in my home village, with arms open wide, willing to accept all who will ride with me to the Bright Castle and rid our country of the oppression of the Light! 

Who’s with me?!
