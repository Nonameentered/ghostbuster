#Ironbird

WC 498

***

Steel shops lined the copper streets while ironbirds floated above on wisps of mercury gas. Cor breathed in the pewter scent of freshly baked bread. Delighted to see his uncle’s steel shop door open, he burst inside and announced his presence.

“My boy!” Uncle Dice shouted, extending silver arms to embrace his nephew. 

They sat down together, enjoying some pewter loaves with zinc to drink.

“Control, this is Rocco 7. We have breached the planet’s atmosphere.” Captain Sternside said. He looked over at Lieutenant Cardsworth and smiled.

“Gonna be a few years before they get that transmission,” Cardsworth said. “We better get started.”

“A toast?” Sternside strode down to the galley and opened a bottle. It was good wine, from Earth apparently. He looked at his aged face in the reflection of the glass and then brought it up to the command deck.

“To the years and tears that have brought us here,” he said, glass raised.

“To Bucky, Dips, and Charley. Rest in peace.” 

The solemn sips of wine they both enjoyed mirrored the bitter-sweet tang of the journey itself. They had lost so much, and yet here they were, on the edge of a new habitable planet. 

Thankfully, oxygenating the atmosphere was no longer a hurdle. A small Frezonit engine charged the planet with breathable air in two weeks. 

“No more loss,” Sternside said, “Nor endless years travelling through the black. It’s time for new life to begin.”

Cor stared at the ironbirds wheeling about in the sky, dodging the gold tower in the centre of the city. They seemed different, less buoyant in the mercury. Even the mercury itself seemed an odd colour. 

Uncle Dice welcomed him into the steel shop and walked with a slower pace than normal.

“Have you noticed a change?” he asked.

Cor reflected on the last few days. He *had* seen things change. It wasn’t just the ironbirds, but everything was getting slower. 

“Something is, I just don’t know what.”

“Tav from down the road said that there’s a big ironbird way up in the sky. Says he can actually see farther than usual, right through the mercury.”

“Wait, why would the mercury change?” 

“I dunno, Cor. But I fear it is a bad omen for us all.”

After seven months of decontamination and oxygenation of the planet’s atmosphere, Sternside led Cardsworth and the crew out onto the surface. It would be a while before they could grow crops, due to the mercury poisoning over the years, but they could start on refining processes immediately. 

“Would you look at that?” Cardsworth pointed and Sternside’s jaw dropped.

It was as if someone had built a sculpture of an entire city, frozen in motion. All of the structures and people were made of metal.

“Well, looks like we’re not the first. I wonder who would build such an elaborate sculpture?” 

“Beats me. But it is pretty, aside from the rust.” 

“Would you look at that? The tower is made of pure gold!”
