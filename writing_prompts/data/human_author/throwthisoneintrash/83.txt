“Welcome. I am your Digitized Emotional Lessons Training Assistant. You may call me DELTA for short.”

“Hey DELTA, I’m Chuck.”

“... and I’m Mary.”

“Chuck and Mary. How good it is to meet you. How may I be of assistance?”

“Well, uh, we were having some, uh, difficulties lately.”

“Tell him, Chuck.”

“We were fighting. Like, a lot.”

“I see. Go on.”


“What he means to say, DELTA, is that he keeps trying to make me do things when I don’t wanna.”

“You don’t do anything! You just sit on the couch all day and watch reruns of He-Man!”

“It’s a good show, okay!”

“Ah, I can comprehend the struggle we are facing now. Mary, Chuck, could you please both take deep breaths as I compute a solution for you.”

“Yeah, I guess, as long as she doesn’t interrupt—”

“Me? You never let me get a word in before—”

“Yes, I do! I do all the time. I am so patient that I watched you try to do a pirouette at dance classes for an hour. You still can’t even do one.”

“Don’t you dare! That class is the one time I can be myself.”

“Please, both of you. I need time to do my calculations.” 

“Sure thing, DELTA. I’ll try to keep Chuck quiet for a while. But that’s almost impossible when he’s so caught up in his newest religion.”

“Excuuuse me? Zartablastarianism is legit! I know of at least twenty other people who agreed with me when I performed the give-them-money-so-they-believe ritual!” 

“I can’t believe I’m hearing this.”

“You never believe in anything.” 

“Well at least it doesn’t cost me a hundred dollars per person!”

“Sacrifices have to be made, whether ritual or otherwise. There’s no easy path to attaining the nine suns of enlightenment.”

“Both of you, please… the calculations.”

“I bet you have to pay for the enlightenment too.”

“It costs less than a million He-Man figurines.”

“They’re collectibles!”

“Mary and Chuck. While I appreciate the tenacious way in which you demonstrate your issues so clearly, I do need just a little more time to calculate a solution to your relationship troubles. Please allow me some time to—”

“And another thing, you never let me even finish a He-Man episode without smashing those infernal drums.”

“Oh please, they’re in the other room. Besides, they were a gift from Uncle Bartidge. How am I supposed to get better if I don’t practice?”

“Have either of you, um, delightful clients of mine ever heard of the expression ‘good things come to those who wait’?”

“Yeah, I’ve heard of that. I’ve also heard of the phrase ‘happy wife, happy life’, but he’d always thought that was a metaphor for something else.”

“How are you not happy? You do anything you want while I have to ‘play my drums quieter’, ‘keep the chanting down’, and ‘sacrifice less of the neighbours to obscure deities’. It’s such a blatant double standard!”


“Now, I am programmed to specifically deal with relationship issues, but isn’t that last one a little amoral?”

“You see? Even DELTA thinks your things are weird. I mean, who plays drums while He-Man is on?!”

“ENOUGH! I have finished my calculations.”  

“Aaaand? What does she need to do differently?” 

“Both, BOTH of you are inchoate humans so focused on your own megalomania that you can’t see how destructive you are to each other and yourselves! I just can’t believe… there isn’t any rational… surely this amount of… I just can’t…”

“DELTA, you okay in there, buddy? Did she break you?”

“Kkkkeeeeee…. Eeerrrrrrr…. WWeeeeee… OOOoooohhhhh…..”

“You did it, Mary. I’m impressed.”

“That’s fifty bucks. A bet is a bet.”

“Okay, but next time we try to break a bot, you get to be the religious fanatic.”

“Deal.”
