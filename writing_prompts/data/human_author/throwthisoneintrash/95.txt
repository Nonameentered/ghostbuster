#The Fox’s Contest

WC 799

***

Once upon a time, in the town of Rye Ting in the land of Purrom Tis, there lived a silver fox. 

Now this fox was craftier than all the creatures of the forest. He lived in a beautiful house, for he loved architecture, and would frequently set up contests for the residents of Rye Ting. 

“By this contract, I agree to pay the winner of my contest a shiny gold piece,” the fox said.

From far and wide, news of the contest spread. It was an inviting reason for many to journey across the kingdom. Soon creatures from as far away as the island chains slithered, stalked, skulked, and swam to take part in the Rye Ting contest. A cunning axolotl told his fellow contestant that he was badder at the Rye Ting contest than anyone else, but his sharp wit and wry smile betrayed his strong intelligence. While nearby, a crab was intimidating everyone who came close to her with a stabby iron implement. A brave knight stepped forward, but soon admitted that the armour he wore was not for protection from weapons but was merely to keep him under cover of darkness since he was a nocturnal being. A sith nodded in agreement. 

The cunning fox cleared his throat and unveiled a poster. On it was written the challenge.

**Prepare a story about a candle and a river.**

The creatures all looked at each other, sizing up the skill of their opponents. One flexed his fist, only to reveal it was a bundle of sticks. Despite that display of interesting anatomy, he was a formidable story teller, and the rest of the contestants eyed him suspiciously. A goose was the only one brave enough to approach the legendary storyteller and honked in displeasure. He was courageous, like those geese from Cannudah, but he insisted he belonged to nobody. He was his own goose and proud of it. 

The feline folks were in a separate section, there was a beautiful cat who yelled “I’m here” while the contestants were in discord. She was then immediately poked in the tummy by one who loved poking cats. A cheetah tried to stop the cat poker, but was far too slow. 

The fox shook his head at all of the newcomers and turned behind him to see the ones who had always been there. A cupcake, smiling cheerfully, a demonic bicycle, also smiling cheerfully for some reason. Even the scarecrow from the farmer’s field was there, guided by a man with a cute dog. It was a paradox of sorts to see the dog owner characterized by his pet, but everyone just loved them both so much they didn’t think too deeply about it. 

“Well,” the fox said, “it's time for the storytelling. I–“ 

Just then, the fabled rulers of Purrom Tis sent a peculiar pair of machines to oversee the contest. One was labelled “Rye Ting, Purrom Tis: Robot”, and the second was similar, “Rye Ting, Purrom Tis: Helper Bot”. 

The fox rolled his eyes. He liked the ancient rulers of the land. They were not among the common folks often but he knew one was tough, he was a survivor, while the other was a bit kinder. Yet, as much as he loved them, he was glad to see the cupcake taking charge of the kingdom’s affairs. 

“We offer you sustenance,” the bots said in unison, while producing plates of dry bread and stagnant water. 

The creatures of the kingdom looked at one another, then back at the fox.

“Aaaanyway, let’s hear those stories.”

There were so many stories that the fox enlisted a friendly banana to help with the judging as well as a cheetah, when he wasn’t distracted. They put their heads together to come up with a winner. Very little could be heard, other than the occasional “that’s just a prologue”, or “the pun just didn’t land for me”. Soon they had a winner.

All of the creatures leaned forward as they shivered with excitement.

“The winner is…” the fox held everyone’s attention, “The…. seaweed?” 

The good townsfolk and visitors looked around for a seaweed, only to see the axolotl change shape with a wisp of ethereal magic and turn into a seaweed himself.

He cackled with his most villainous cackle, but it was just too adorable to be frightening. 

“You fools!” He said, “I am the seaweed.”

The crowd gasped to make him feel better and he squirmed up to the podium to accept his prize. But then. a rumble was heard in the distance. Several islands moved across the land and arrived in front of the podium.

“Badder,” the booming voice said, “you need to do your talking on Tuesday. Come with me.”

They left for the ocean and everyone lived happily ever after.
