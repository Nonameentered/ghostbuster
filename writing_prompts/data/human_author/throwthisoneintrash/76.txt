#Strawberries

WC 717

The hospital bed felt like an imitation of the real thing. It made me think about just how little we need for survival. A safe place to sleep, some food, some water, and not much else. 

“Shawn!” my best friend yelled across the room just as my eyes fluttered open. “Dude, I got you your favourite…” then he paused.

“My favourite what?” I asked. 

“Um, do you… like… remember me, bro?” 

“Eric, of course I do.” 

“Cool cool. Yeah. I didn’t mean to be rude, but the doc said you had amnesia.” 

“Huh? Really?” 

“Yeah, dude. The last time you were awake, he went over it with you. Remember how he said you only have one day left in the hospital so he wanted you to be prepared.” I saw the edges of his eyes lift in concern. 

“Well, I guess I forgot. They must have me on some powerful meds.”

“Yeah…”

“So, it’s nice to see you, Eric. Do you know how long I’m gonna be here?” 

“Today’s the last day.” His voice was as sturdy as I expected, but his eyebrows were raised. “I brought you your mom’s famous pancake breakfast!” 

“Oohh, sweet!” I clambered to the side of the bed, envisioning the syrup, strawberries and whipped cream piled on top of gorgeous, fluffy pancakes. 

Eric pulled out several Tupperware containers and slowly peeled back the lid, as if it were a reveal at a fancy restaurant. I laughed and his shoulders dropped as he laughed too. 

“Wait, where’s the strawberries?” 

“You remem–. I mean, they weren’t in stock at the grocery store.”

“Well, tell my mom that this was extravagant even without the strawberries.” 

I quietly ate as my friend grew more anxious. I could tell he was letting his worries take over his mind. 

“You know, Eric, I actually remember everything.”

“Yeah. I guess I was just worried about when you didn’t recall what the doctor said.”

“Meds, dude. Relax.”

“But you aren’t on any meds.” 

I stopped to think about that as I cleaned my plate. Top notch pancakes as always.

“It just doesn’t make sense. I’ve never been such a real person. As I am today, that is.” 

Eric looked puzzled, then slowly replied. “I can’t believe what you say.”

“Why?”

“Because I see what you do! You forget everything that just happened!” 

A doctor burst into the room, obviously distracted. He was fiddling with some charts and barely glanced up as he spoke. 

“Shawn Carpenter, you have been diagnosed with anterograde amnesia. You will have trouble with short term memory functions going forward. Try to learn some tricks to aid your short term memory. I’ll leave some literature with your family outlining community resources you can take advantage of for help.”

“How long will it last?” I asked. 

“I’m afraid this isn’t like the movies,” he said, his hand resting gently on my shoulder. “You will struggle with this for the rest of your life. But there are tools you can use to help sort out your thoughts. Old memories will try to embrangle with new ones, so developing a system of keeping things straight will be beneficial.” 

Eric left eventually and Mom came by to pick me up after her workday. She was a mess of tears and love that I didn’t quite know how to handle. Rather than let her flounder, I squeezed her tight until her tears stopped and she looked up at me. 

“We’re gonna be okay, Shawn. Just trust me to help you when you need it, okay? No more macho bravado. You need help now.”

“Maybe I should start writing stuff down, you know? Like a journal?”

“That’s a good idea.” She nodded as we drove back home through the city. 

I wanted to lighten the mood, so I turned to her and asked a question. “So, maybe we can make some of your famous pancakes with strawberries when we get home?” 

She started crying again. I encouraged her to pull over and we both sat there for a while as she regained her composure. 

“I don’t know what I did, but I expect this will take a while to get used to, won’t it?” 

She smiled with determination in her eyes. 

“We’re gonna do it, my baby boy. We’re gonna do it together.”
