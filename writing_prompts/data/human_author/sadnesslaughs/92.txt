I adjusted my tie in the mirror, trying to generate some holiday spirit through my festive red tie. The fabric coated with little golden stars, something that I was certain would help me get a date tonight. “Lady luck be on my side tonight, because this gentleman is awfully lonely.”

 

Fate appeared to have a hatred for me, doing whatever it could to stop me from ever finding my true love. It was cruel. While others found their ideal partner in a surprise coffee shop meeting or by bumping into them at a friend’s house, I had yet to find my person. I even tried visiting the same coffee shop for a whole week, sitting there all day, sipping my coffee, waiting for the moment in which my lover would spill coffee on me or accidentally bump into me and yet, no matter how many days I spent there, nothing happened. Forced to watch others around me find their lovers while I sat alone.

 

“Guess I’ll just make my own luck tonight. Who needs something as stupid as fate? I’ll win someone over with my charm.” I exclaimed to the mirror, only to feel my confidence falter when I looked over my face. “Perhaps I’m just getting too old. Twenty-six is the new thirty. Maybe I missed my calling?”   

 

I began undoing my tie, talking myself out of the moment. Even in a world where love comes easily, maybe love just wasn’t for me? As the tie loosened, it lowered, leaving the knot pressed against my chest. I went to pull it over my head, only to spot a strange dark spot in the mirror. “Is it dirt? I just cleaned the thing a few days ago.” I leant in, trying to get a better look, only to feel a pair of lips hit against mine, sending me backwards onto the floor as a body landed on top of me.

 

“Found you.” A voice as rough as sandpaper said, reaching forward to grab my neck. I could feel their fingers dancing along my skin, sharp nails poking at the flesh before they stopped. “Who are you? This isn’t the home I was haunting, and you aren’t the man who is tormented by visions of his dead wife. He wouldn’t wear a tie this colorful.” They moved their hand down to grab at my tie, feeling over the fabric with the tips of their fingers.

As I shook off the initial shock of our collision, I spotted the heavily scarred woman looming over me. Her eyes a pure white, leaving her looking soulless. She wore a flowing white wedding dress that had charred endings at the sleeves and feet, giving her an angelic quality. When our eyes met, I gave her a smile, staring up at her ash coated grey hair. “The only thing I’m haunted by is my lack of love and I believe you might be the cure.”

 

I moved my hand onto hers, careful not to get scratched by her long nails. She gave me a weird look, not moving her hand away, only seeing where I was going with this. She was giving me a chance, something that no one else in this universe had ever done.

 

“I imagine you must be lonely too, right? Maybe this meeting was fate. Two lonely hearts brought together to become one. You like my tie and I love the way your hair compliments your outfit. Whenever you shake your head, it’s like an ash covered snowfall. One that I want to get lost in”

 

She shifted away from me, creating some distance between us. Great, I had blown it. I should have just kept my mouth shut. She said nothing right away, taking some time to process the situation before speaking up.

 

 “I am rather lonely. Maybe we could grab some dinner tonight? I do like your tie; it reminds me of all those I have killed. The little stars are like a symbol of their soul trapped in a sea of blood. It’s rather romantic.”

 

It seemed we both had very different ideas of romance, something that couldn’t be helped given we weren’t from the same universe. Still, I refused to let that stop us. I stood up and took her hand, offering her a smile. “Let’s go then. I know this place that does an amazing steak. I’m sure you would prefer something rather rare, right?”

 

“I would, how thoughtful of you.” I felt her head hit my shoulder, resting against me as we walked outside, getting a few odd looks from the perfect family friendly couples around us. Even with all the staring, I didn’t care. I was in love.
