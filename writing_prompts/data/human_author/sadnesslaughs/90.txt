[Part 2 of 2]

“AHHHH, not my arm, it hurts, its hurts.” I wailed, swaying my arm around only to notice I had feeling. I opened my eyes, spotting a white-robed man standing before me, his face screwed in frustration, having a few coffee/tea stains now coating the white fabric.

 

“It doesn’t hurt. The teleportation is painless. I’m Greg, but you can call me the true one. Welcome to the council of humanity.” The man gave me a smile, quickly getting over my drink being spilled on him. His hand wrapping around my shoulder, leading me down a hallway.

 

It was odd. The inside of the tower matched any generic office building in our world. Except it was far nicer, having nice leather coated seating and a wine fridge instead of a water cooler. Greg led me through the bland light brown hallway before coming to a room labelled with my name and the caption. ‘The creator of the divine elixir.’

 

“This will be your office.” Greg pushed open the door, revealing the empty room, only having a chair, table, and a few empty bookshelves. “Sorry about the lack of furniture. We didn’t expect that you would arrive this early. We predicted you would be a few centuries longer.”

“It’s fine. What exactly am I doing here, though? I thought being the chosen one would be more feasts and parties?” It felt a little underwhelming. If this is all one got for creating a divine elixir, then perhaps I should have never attempted it.

 

“Those will come, but us chosen ones still need to work. Just be glad you weren’t here during the stone and chisel stage. Computers are far easier to write on. As a chosen being, it will be your job to help steer the world in the right direction. People think the rich influence the world, but they are ignorant of our existence. We are the ones who determine the fate of the world, only we are qualified to play judge, jury, and executioner to the planet.”

 

“I see. So, does that make us immortal?”

 

“Well, it does, but you still need to bathe in the forbidden mixture of eternal life.” He explained, reaching into his robes, pulling out a pamphlet. “It’s all explained in this. This will help you through your first few weeks. Of course, if you have any questions, you can always send me an email or even come to my office. I work down the hall from you.”

 

I flipped through the pamphlet, landing on the mixture of eternal life. There was a picture of a brown-haired woman in a long, flowing white robe like that of the man. She was pointing to a filled a bathtub with a look of utter delight, an expression like the one I had when I discovered my mixture. “What’s it made of?”

 

“Oh, it’s made of milk, honey and a lot of pickle juice. Yes, our Cleo is a genuine genius, one of the finer inventors, if you ask me. She’s a lovely woman too. I’m sure you will meet her at our next office party. We have one every three days, so I’ll email you an invitation when we have the time planned.”

 

“Pickle juice?” The other two ingredients made sense, but pickle juice?

“Oh. Sugar too. Yes, the pickle juice absorbs the honey and causes this long-lasting tonic that seeps through your pores. It rejuvenates you entirely. If you have any aches or pains, then you can say goodbye to those tomorrow. You will feel twenty again.”

 

“But I’m only twenty-six.”

 

“So? Who doesn’t want to feel twenty?”

 

Greg gave me a pat on the back before speaking up again. “You will love it here. The world never understood us, but we understand each other. Each of us possesses a mind made for experimentation. The greatest thinkers in the world surround you. You have me, the creator of teleportation, who broke down organic material by combining milk and orange juice with a current of 200 watts of electricity. There’s also Julio, the man who had the courage to stomp on grapes and create wine, even while others mocked him for doing such a thing. Julio is one of the kindest men you will ever meet. He even left his gift to humanity before coming here.”

 

“Wow. I feel a little undeserving. I only mixed tea and coffee.” Everyone else had such incredible feats, and with Julio. Incredible feet, but what did I have? A curious mind, and that was about it.

 

“Only mixed tea and coffee?” Greg slammed his fists down on my desk, causing me to bounce up like a spring, struggling to hold my tea and coffee mixture. “You did something brave even while others thought you were crazy. That alone is worthy of being here. You made a drink that not only temporarily slows time, but one that also calms the drinker. You are worthy. Now please, read through the pamphlet. I’ll knock on your door when your computers ready. Should only be a few hours.”

 

Greg gave me a smile before he headed out, leaving me to stand in my empty office. I took a sip of my drink before staring down at the pamphlet once more. He was right; I deserved to be here.
