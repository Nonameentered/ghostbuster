[Part 2 of 2]

“Um, Rob. From Rob and son’s mechanics. I don’t have a son. I just thought that the name would make my business sound more authentic and would bring in the customers. But clearly it didn’t.” I motioned to my near empty store, only having one car currently in my workshop. With that, I went to the staffroom, my steps followed by the flashes of a camera and alien chatter.

 

Searching my staffroom for ingredients, I found a few pieces of nearly stale bread and a jar of vegemite that had been there since the shop opened three years ago. Given the bread was a little old, I shoved it into my toaster, listening to the horrible metallic groans as my old toaster did its best to toast the bread.

 

With the toast ready, I slathered on a nice amount of vegemite. I was a professional after all and knew that vegemite was a more even to moderate spread. Not like those half jar spreads that those viral stars do before complaining that the taste is too strong. Amateurs, giving a wonderful dish a bad name. Everyone knows a half jar spread is only for the professionals.

 

 I finished up the meal and my little rant before letting out a sigh. Was this going to cut it? These aliens had tasted human food, they would know that my cooking was just above a six-year-old’s. Still, I hadn’t charged them, so they couldn’t complain unless they got food poisoning. I just hoped food poisoning was only a human problem. Bringing out the two plates, I placed them on the hood of the car.

 

“This is a vegemite sandwich. It’s a dish from my home country and something I hope you appreciate as much as I did growing up.” I did my best to give the food a story, acting like I was a recipe writer trying to reach their word count. I would have called it vegemite toast, if not for the fact that the toaster had only given the bread the equivalent of a mild sunburn rather than actually toasting it.

A flash of light again blinded me. As the camera went off and as my eyes recovered, they were both at my side once more. It was like a magic trick; just how quickly could they move? The thought made me shiver.

 

“OHHH, I’ve never seen such a dish. It looks simple and yet I sense some complexities. The food has feeling and soul, a string of passion that is already tingling on my two tongues.” Hexi said, opening her mouth, letting two long black tongues roll out from it.

“It’s just a vegemite sandwich. It’s really not that complex.”

 

“It is. You can just feel the energy from it. It smells like something we would fuel our ships with, and yet there’s a certain allure. The way it sits on the warm bread is exciting. May we taste it?”

 

I had never heard anyone say anything nice inside my workshop before. It was lovely to be complimented for a change. They even impressed me by managing not to repeat themselves in their excitement, clearly trying to be as polite as possible. Maybe I should try to get a job on an alien ship? Would be better than dealing with people that don’t appreciate me.

 

“Sure, here you go.” I just smiled and handed them a vegemite sandwich.

 

I watched as they wrapped their tongues around the sandwich, bringing the sandwich into their mouths before munching on it with a ferocity that made it look like their mouths would pop off at any moment. The small teeth tearing the meal apart before eventually it was swallowed. They both stared at me, not uttering a word, leaving me to take a few uneasy steps back. Was it not good enough? Were they going to eat me now?

 

“Wonder, just so very wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.” Hexi cheered as she licked her lips. Her arms wrapped around Lavpi, waiting for his opinion.

 

“Its something so new. I have tasted nothing comparable. It’s something so new.” Neither alien could hide their feelings. The two boundmates hugging each other in an oddly cute way before turning back to me.

 

“Please, you must take the money. Is it ok if we come back? We would love to sample this meal again.” Hexi nudged Lavpi as the alien again opened his stomach flap, allowing me a chance to reach in and grab the money.

 

“We insist. You did us a great service human. Please, take it.”

 

I looked away as I reached into the flap, shivering as I heard the wet squeaks of liquid before I pulled out the notes. I gave my hand a few waves, cleaning the liquid as best I could before setting the money aside.

 

“Sure, I’ll buy some more bread. If you want to come back, feel free too. It’s been pretty pleasant having you around.”
With that, the two aliens were off, leaving me to finish my repairs. Little did I know, the two aliens were the off world equivalent of foodies and my humble mechanic shop had earned five Glummixs out of five. Soon I was greeted every day by crowds of aliens requesting my sandwiches. Eventually, it became easier just to give up on being a mechanic and become a chef. Still, I knew the vegemite sandwich hype would die down eventually, which is why I was planning my next dish, fairy bread.

 

My favorite and first customers still dropped in and of course they always had a seat at my workshop turned kitchen. I was getting to know them rather well. They even offered to take me to their home world for a visit. As much as I would love to go, I doubt the alien embassy on Earth would approve of it, mainly because they were jealous that the aliens seemed fonder of me than them.

 

Who knows, maybe someday I would get to taste their cooking. For now, though, I will just enjoy the moment.
