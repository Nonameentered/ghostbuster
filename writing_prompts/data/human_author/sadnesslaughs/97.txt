She stood before me in a long silver dress, one covered in sparkling marble-colored orbs. She gave a small spin, showing off her dress before she came to my side, still looking as human as ever.

 

“You aren’t human, are you?” Even in these unnatural circumstances, I couldn’t confidently determine what she was. I hoped she would give me a hint, but she only smirked, motioning me to a wall north of the room.

 

“I’ll tell you at the end of our trip. I don’t want to ruin this moment.” Her hand rested against the metal, causing it to stir to life, peeling open to reveal the majestic stars hidden behind it. The starry sky a sight to behold as I pressed my face against the glass, like an overexcited child at the zoo. “What do you think?”

 

“Stunning, something I could never have imagined. Is it real? Are we in space? If this is some weird tv show, you have to tell me now.” Even when I spoke those words, I couldn’t bring myself to look away from the sight, each star glistening with an allure that made me want to weep.

 

“As real as you or me. You own that entire constellation. It’s my gift to you, if you wish to accept it. I understand it’s not much, but surely it will cover those five stars you wanted, correct?” Her warm smile made me feel a tinge of guilt. She was far too kind, offering me something like this.

 

“I can’t accept it. I’m sorry, it’s beautiful, something I would love to own but I don’t think I would feel right owning something like this. Especially if it belongs to you.”

Her lips curled down as she covered her mouth. I hadn’t meant to offend her. She had done all of this for me, and I just shoved the present right back in her face like an ungrateful brat. I wasn’t sure if she could cry, given she never blinked, but her pained expression broke my heart. “That’s fine. I understand. Offering something so small was rude of me. Please, accept my apologies.” Then the tears fell. Deep silver tears rolling down her cheeks as I awkwardly stood before her, trying to fix this situation.

 

“No, no, you misunderstand. This is more than enough. It’s greater than anything anyone has ever given me. That’s why I want us to share it. Why should I own something this beautiful alone? Let’s share it, we can both enjoy it together.”

The tears stopped and were replaced by a look of utter joy. Her arms wrapping around me, squeezing the air from my lungs. “Oh, yes. That is amazing. I would love to marry you. To think you would say something like that without knowing what I really look like, you are an amazing human.”

 

I gave her a few soft pats on the back, trying to process what had occurred. “You want to marry me? I’m a human, wouldn’t that not work?” My kindness only kept digging me deeper into a hole as she pulled away from the hug, shaking her head.

 

“No, it’s perfect. There aren’t many of my kind left. I thought I would be a queen without a king forever. Then I go to Earth and find you, the kindest of all the Earthlings. You pull over and utter those magic words. Uber. Before allowing me into your vehicle. I may have never found a way back to my ship without you. To think you did that with no promise of money or gold. All you asked is that I consider giving you five stars. I fell for you in an instant.”

 

She hadn’t been my fare. I hadn’t even noticed that I didn’t get paid for the job; the weirdness of it all too distracting for me to check. So, I just saw her standing on a street corner, vacantly staring into space, and assumed she was my fare. I really need to confirm who is in my car before entering the coordinates into my GPS.

 

“Thank you. But Earth has a tradition of dating. We can’t just get married right away. We would need to date first. It’s like a trial to be lovers? I’m sure a queen is far too busy for that.” 
“Not at all. I will happily endure any trial that I must face. My people also have a trial where you must fend off ten wild Baxils to claim my hand. As is tradition among royalty. Though, given we lost the Baxils with our planet, I’m happy to skip that part if you would like.”

 

“Yeah, we can skip that.” I didn’t know what a Baxil was, but it sounded intimidating. I also didn’t want to find out what the alternative would be for me to fight if I accepted.

 

“Very well, then. I will conduct your dating trial. I promise you I will pass this trial. We will be together.” As she said that, she reached for her hair, gripping something that made the sound of a zipper being pulled, only to stop. “Close your eyes for a moment.” I did as instructed and waited. With each passing second, I felt my anxiety growing until she tapped my shoulder. “You may look.”

 

I opened my eyes, only to flinch when I saw the bright sight before me. She was a foot taller than me with a stunning deep tone to her body that matched the magnificence of the space surrounding us. A few patches of her body had sparks of bright white light, dazzling me with its shine. When my eyes adjusted to the sight, I gazed at her face. Wondering how she kept herself hidden in that shorter human disguise for so long.

 

She had one cyclops like eye in the center of her face, that probably being why she couldn’t blink in her human disguise, obviously finding it difficult given the positioning of her face. Her purple pupil staring at me as she adjusted her violet hair. “You look nice.” was all I could say. Feeling a little unimpressive standing in front of her.

 

“That’s wonderful to hear. I will visit you on one of our dates tomorrow. I just wanted you to see me before I sent you back. Plan something fun for us!” She gave me a wave before the white light filled the room, returning me to the center of my living room.
