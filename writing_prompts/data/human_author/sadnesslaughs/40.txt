“No claws, but it has a really long smile and these glowing white eyes.” Mary said, opening her eyes as wide as possible to show the sort of creature that was standing beside her.

 

“Hmm. Ok, so it’s not a demon. Demons have claws, at least they do according to the information mom left.” Paula sighed, wishing her mother was here to help with this. Why did the supernatural abilities skip a generation? To Paula, the spot next to her daughter was just an empty space, but it was clear from the detailed conversations that Mary had that there was more to this. “And you said it calls itself Stewie? Can you tell me more about them? Do they seem human?”

 

Mary turned, staring up at the creature beside her. She squinted her gaze, making a small umm noise before finally nodding. “Yeah, it looks like a lady. Oh, and she stands like this.” Mary hunched over, trying to imitate the walk of the creature.

 

“Ok, so humanoid. Great, that’s still a long list.” Paula did her best to keep calm, but internally she was screaming. A monster was beside her daughter, and she had to remain calm? What if it was waiting to kill them? Paula re-read the words at the top of the page, mentioning to stay calm. Trusting that her mother knew best.

 

“Mom, Stewie doesn’t seem mean. She has been really kind to me. She even follows you around the house a lot.” Mary said, her words causing her mother to freeze up, gripping the paper a little tighter.

 

“Oh? That’s comforting dear.” She lied, frantically searching for the creature on the list. She flipped the paper over, checking over the other options. “How many eyes?”

 

“Two.”

 

“And fingers?”

 

“Five!”

“Five on each hand? Or just five?”

 

“Five on each hand. Stewie also has long, grey hair, but it’s all dirty.” Mary said, before laughing. “Stewies telling me to mind my manners.”

“Don’t you talk to my daughter like that.” Paula smacked the air with the paper, before looking it over once more. “Ok, so it’s not a possessed doll. Unless its under an invisibility spell? It could be a ghost, but ghosts don’t have defined human characteristics unless they are tormented souls or powerful. Given the house isn’t torn apart, I can’t imagine its tormented. Oh, if you were here mom, you would be so embarrassed. I’m such a failure. You tried your best to teach me all of this, and I failed. If only you were….” Paula looked at the paper, glancing over the characteristics once more before tilting her head. “Mom?”

 

“Huh? Stewie? You didn’t tell me your were mom’s mom.”

 

“Grandmother, dear. The word you’re looking for is grandmother.” Paula wiped her eyes, standing in front of where she thought the figure was. “You trickster, why would you call yourself Stewie? Were you trying to give me a heart attack?”

 “Grandma! I didn’t know it was you. You still owe me an ice cream. You said if I could learn to levitate a book, you would buy me one and I did.”

 

“Sweetie, grandma passed away before you learned to do that. Remember? We talked about this. Is it really you, mom or is it just a ghost trying to trick me?”

 

A warmth passed over Paula as if someone had pulled her into a sudden embrace. She lowered her head into the warmth, letting out a content sigh.

 

“Grandma says she’s sorry. She didn’t realize dying was such a trau? Trau? Traumatic experience.” Mary said, stumbling over the harder word. “She found her way back and now she wants to train me. She didn’t tell you because she wanted to teach me a few spells before you knew, in case you sent her away.”

 

“Aww mom. I could never send you away. I do, however, want her to spend some time studying like a normal child. That means you have to help her with her homework before any supernatural study. At least an hour a day of homework and then you can teach her. Understood?”

 

Mary looked at the space. The two whispered back and forth before Mary nodded. “She said it’s ok, but only if you pay off her debt.”

 

“Debt? Oh, no mom. What sort of debt do you have? Did you sign a deal with the devil? I’m not giving up my first-born child, if that’s what you're suggesting.”

 

Mary laughed at her mother’s concern. “She never got me that ice-cream, so you have to. Come on, I want to go get a strawberry one. Maybe one day I can even reveal grandma to you with a spell.” Mary took her mom’s hand, dragging her towards the door.

 

“Ok, fine. Jeez, you two are as bad as each other. Don’t give your poor mother a heart attack.” Paula turned to the spot once more before they left. “I miss you, mom. I hope I can give you a proper hug someday. Wait! Slow down Mary.” Paula felt her daughter tugging her sleeve, pulling her out of the door.

 

Stewie or Grandma Rina, as she was more commonly known, only watched with a smirk on her face. Perhaps it was cruel to play a prank on her daughter, but it was her way of keeping herself from crying. The last thing she needed was Mary seeing her grandmother cry. When the two left, Rina locked the door, protecting the house until they returned.
