Jason peered into the window of the dream eaters’ home, looking over the decomposing building’s interior. Inside all he would find is old, dust covered furniture, much of it looking as though it would fall apart at the touch of a light breeze. He grabbed the crumbled note in his pocket, checking over the address. This was really the place? Jason couldn’t help but feel as though he was the victim of a cruel internet prank. How stupid could he be? Who in their right minds would ever believe a dream eater was a thing that existed?

 

Ready to accept his wasted afternoon, he turned away from the home, heading back to the street. Hoping the bus wouldn’t take long to get here, standing near this place gave him an unnatural feeling of dread. As though someone would burst through that window and grab him at any moment.

 

He tapped at his phone, passing the time with a few pointless clicks, only to hear the front door of the home open behind him. He turned, staring at the open doorway, deciding beyond his better judgement to get a closer look. “Hello? Is someone home? Are you the house of the dream eater?”

 

Silence followed his words, letting them linger for a moment before an old, dusty voice responded. “This is the house of the dream eater. Please come inside.” An older woman made herself visible in the doorway, having greying skin and tired eyes. She gave Jason a kind smile, opening the door wider for him.

 

“So, how does this work? Can you really get rid of my bad dreams?” Jason asked, following her inside, not taking a seat on any of the furniture, waiting instead for her answer.

 

“I can’t, but my son can. He can feast on the dreams of anyone he encounters, ridding them of both nightmares and pleasant dreams. Unfortunately, his abilities cannot determine the difference between a nightmare and a pleasant dream, meaning you may need a few sessions before you finally encounter the nightmare you want removed. Shall I prepare some tea? That will put you into a deep sleep.”

 

“How much does this cost? Should I discuss it with your son first?” Jason questioned the old woman, who only shook her head. She directed Jason into the kitchen as she prepared a kettle. 

“First session is thirty dollars, then twenty for anything after that. I don’t enjoy charging extravagant prices for our services.” When Jason reached for his pocket, she waved her hand. “I’ll collect it after the session, don’t worry about that for now. Please, go lay down on the couch, get some rest.”

 

Jason did as instructed, heading into the living room, sitting himself down on a picnic-colored couch. As he waited for the woman to return, he could hear the faint sounds of dripping water, seeing a crack coming from the room above. The clear liquid coating the floorboards as it dribbled down. “I think you have a leak; do you want me to go upstairs and have a look?”

 

“NO! No, sweetie, it’s alright. It happens, this place is old. I’m sure that leak will sort itself out.” A few thumps coming from the kitchen followed her words. Jason got up, peeking his head into the kitchen, watching as the old woman smacked the ceiling with a broom. “Not yet.” She muttered, only to notice Jason was watching. “Tea’s not ready yet. Please sit down.”

 

Jason thought about leaving, but if he did, he might never rid himself of those horrible dreams. Deciding to endure the strangeness of the home, he patiently waited for the woman to return. When she returned, the leak miraculously stopped, and she offered him a sunflower coated teacup.  

 

“Just drink this. It’s mint flavored, so it shouldn’t be too horrible. Oh, mind sitting on the couch over there? People struggle to sleep on this one.” The couch she was pointing at looked cheap. The couch having a few blankets hastily thrown over it, most likely to disguise what was underneath. 

 

Jason accepted the cup and moved over to the other couch across the room. As he sat himself down, he felt the stiffness of the cushion’s underneath. Unable to wiggle himself into the couch, the fabric underneath offering him no comfort. “Are you sure this is the right couch? It’s hard.”

 

“It won’t be once you drink the tea. Trust me, this is the couch you want to be on.”  

 

Jason gave the tea a sniff, getting a whiff of the minty flavor lingering off it. After the initial sniff, he downed the cup, swallowing the mixture as he laid back. It didn’t take long for his body to go stiff, unable to move. The woman grabbed his hand, inspecting it. She turned it over a few times before placing it back at his side. 

 

“Don’t worry, you will be dreaming soon.” She said, pushing the couch. Jason could feel the rattling of wheels underneath, as though someone had just covered a hospital bed with a few blankets. He wanted to ask her where they were going, but found it impossible to speak, only able to make small murmurs as they pushed him along.

The woman left his side, going to open a door before continuing to push Jason, this time leading him down a flight of stairs. Either the old woman was stronger than Jason could have ever imagined, or he was hallucinating. It was impossible to tell after that tea. The incline of the bed soon settled as he reached the basement, being wheeled to a dark room.

 

“Ok, now he’s ready.” The woman called out. Jason could hear a heavy body come rushing down the stairs, each movement they took shaking the home. In the commotion, it threw his head to the side, pointed directly at a skeletal figure slouched against the wall, their skull facing the ground.
Jason wanted to scream but he couldn’t, already feeling exhausted. The loud steps grew closer before Jason spotted its source. The human crawled along the floor, their stomach dragging against it, filled with a shifting mass that pushed against its skin, as though it were trying to free itself from him. His eyes sunken and his hair disheveled, looking as though even the act of moving was causing him great pain, giving how his lips parted in heavy gasps. As his mouth opened, Jason could see small rows of tendrils inside, each coated in pointed teeth.

 

“It’s ok, you won’t even notice him eating. You will have pleasant dreams until you eventually pass away. I’m sorry, but my son must feed, and he just loves dreams. I’ll keep you alive for as long as I can, but eventually you will perish.” She dragged her fingers through Jason’s hair, trying to comfort him. “I know I spoil him and perhaps overfeed him, but can you blame a mother for caring? Shush, it will all be over soon. All your stress and unease will pass.”

 

With that, Jason felt his eyes grow tired, the creature’s jaw unhinging, as the tendrils danced in front of him, shifting closer to his face. When his eyes shut, he felt a wet sensation as creature latched onto his face, feasting on his dreams.
