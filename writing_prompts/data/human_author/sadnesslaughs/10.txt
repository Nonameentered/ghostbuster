[Part 2 of 2]

Tensions continued to rise until the door to the bathroom opened, as Dave slowly made his way back to the bar, giving the group a smile. “Sorry, did I take too long? My bad, I’m not used to these crutches at all. Honestly, I could use a hand around here. Maybe I should hire some staff. Anyway, what can I get you all?”

 

The group stared at one another, letting the aggressions die down. Melis considered those words as each snake head faced one another, sharing the same thought. Melis wrote a few notes in her notepad before ripping them out, giving them to each of the regulars as Dave only watched on.

 

“I hope those are only compliments, Melis. I’m fine, I promise. Seeing everyone here lifts my spirits. How about a free drink, everyone? To celebrate our friendship. If you all consider me a friend, that is.”

 

Despite the offer of a free drink, no one accepted, each continuing to pay. Dave’s attempt to get their minds off his injury not working and as the night drifted on, his suspicions only grew. Unfortunately, he could only do so much. Once they had their mind set on something, it was impossible for him to convince them otherwise. He just had to hope some of his kindness and human morality had rubbed off on them.

 

When the bar shut, the regulars rushed out, leaving Dave to clean up the usual messes of drink-stained tables and left-over meals. Once he was done, he returned home, purposely not checking any news stations or social media sites. If there was a gruesome murder, he would deal with it tomorrow.

Heading to the bar the next day, his slow hop with the crutches turned into a desperate stride as he saw the door already opened. “Shit, please, not a break in. I can’t afford to pay for the damages.” As he nearly collapsed through the door, his regulars greeted him, each having wide grins that made his skin crawl. He frantically scanned the room for a body, or worse. He had never seen them work together on something before, which was sounding alarm bells in his mind.

 

“What did you do to them? Are they dead? I thought I told you not to hurt them. This is bad. I don’t know what to do about murders. If the health inspector finds out about this, I’m ruined. Ah, what if the cops find out?” Dave’s panic caused the regulars to glance around, wondering who had been murdered until they made the connection.

 

“You thought we murdered them? What do you think we are, monsters?” Devi said.

 

“I… No, of course not. You’re not monsters. I didn’t mean anything like that.”

 

“Relax, we are monsters, but we didn’t murder anyone. I voted we kill them, but sadly Melis has a way of convincing people. I just wish she used her words rather than notepads and snakeheads.”

 

“My snakes are cute.” The snakes hissed at Devi, who only stuck his forked tongue back out at them, still sulking about not being allowed to take their souls. “It’s not like I threatened anyone, either. I just told them it wasn’t what Dave would have wanted.”

 

“That’s correct. A snake couldn’t threaten an immortal vampire like myself. As someone with previous humanity in me, it made sense that you wouldn’t want bloodshed. So, I agreed with her plan.” Victor said.

 

“I thought you wanted to leave their dried-up bodies at the door? Personally, I wanted to drag them inside and give them to you as a present. But Melis was right, you would have to clean up the mess and that would only be extra work for you.” Kali earned a glare from Victor after his comment. The vampire not appreciating having his original plan brought up. 

“I only planned to do that before I heard the plan. Can you fault me for trying to do a good deed for our bartender?”

 

“I was going to haunt them, but apparently haunting is too extreme a punishment. I thought haunting their every waking moment until they can’t sleep was a fitting punishment, but maybe that was cruel in hindsight.” Suzy’s words caused Dave to jump, not even noticing the ghost standing beside him.

 

“So, what did you do then?” Dave didn’t want to ask, but he had to know. Needing to know how big of a mess he was in.

 

Melis pointed to the kitchen as five rough looking males walked out, each wearing a white dress shirt with black pants. The bar didn’t exactly have a uniform, but it was what Dave wore most nights, so it seemed they were trying to mimic him.

 

“Introducing your newest workers. See, I thought about what you said about them not having money, so I thought they could work off the money they stole from you. Who knows, maybe if they do a good enough job you could pay them after it? They will work for minimum wage and I think with enough help, you could earn enough money to expand this place.” Melis explained, rather proud of her plan.

 

“Um, Melis.” Dave leaned closer to her. A little too close, as one snakeheads used this as a chance to give his cheek a small kiss while the others listened. “What about the fact that everyone’s a monster?”

 

Devi had his face next to Melis, listening in as well. He clapped his hands together, delighted to explain his role in the plan. “Well, with my demonic magic, I can change what they see. To them, we just look like normal guests. Sure, we might say weird things, which is why I made it seem like this was a monster themed bar, so our little monster chatter will seem normal to them.”

 

“And they are ok with all of this.”

 

“When I explained it was work for you or jail. They happily agreed. I think this is a better solution for everyone.” Melis said.

 

Dave looked at the group. They didn’t seem scared or angry, just normal people waiting for orders from their boss. He went over to one of them, making sure they weren’t hypnotized. “Anything you want to say?”

“Look, I’m not going to apologize or anything. What’s done is done. Just let us work for you and we can call it even, ok?”

 

It wasn’t exactly a friendly response, but it was a human one. One that was free from any mind control. Maybe he could help with their attitudes later? For now, Dave was satisfied, giving them instructions on how to set the bar before he returned to the counter, being followed by Melis.

 

“Thank you Melis, I appreciate this. It means a lot to know someone cares enough to go out of their way for me. How about I get you a drink? We have some time to chat before the bar opens. Actually, everyone tell me what you want to drink. All drinks are free until we open.”

 

The regulars cheered as Melis sat on her stool. She looked at her notepad, reading over a few of the pages before putting it aside. Maybe she would show him that another night. For now, she would just enjoy this moment. Sharing in the cheer as the regulars came over to take a seat at the bar, sharing a few laughs with their favorite human.
