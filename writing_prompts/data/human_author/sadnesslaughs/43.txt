“Stop being stupid. I’ve been over to the other side. It’s just a forest. There’s no ghost or anything like that. It’s just my weird family being weird.” Alan said, the two children sitting on the edge of the riverbank, looking at the decayed bridge that had half sunken into the misty green water below.

 

“It’s weird. Why wouldn’t you build it again if it’s just a bridge? Maybe your family are werewolves and if they cross the bridge, they turn into furry creatures that bite people.” Evelyn said, pinching the elbow of Alan, imitating the bite of a rather feisty chihuahua, causing Alan to jump from his spot, nearly stumbling into the water.

 

“Knock it off! That isn’t even how werewolves work, idiot.”

 

“Oh, yeah? How would you know? Does that mean you’re a werewolf?”

 

“Shut up! I just know. It’s not that weird. Why would we want a bridge that no one uses? What if a bear comes over and knocks on our window?”

 

“Or a werewolf?” Evelyn said, trying to pinch his elbow again, only to miss as he quickly pulled it away.

 

“There are no werewolves. My family just said that we can’t build the bridge again because that’s what my great great grandparents said. Maybe they just liked the original bridge they built?”

 

“Or maybe there’s an alien egg that your great great grandparents planted in the soil over there? What if they knew that the egg hatching would break the bridge, so they left the message?” Evelyn said, pushing up her glasses, her excitement in her wild theories having caused them to slide down the bridge of her nose.

 

“Aliens?” Alan hadn’t considered aliens. He paused, giving it some thought before shaking his head. “My great great grandparents wouldn’t plant alien eggs. Why would they do that?”

 

“Because they were aliens? Oh, that would make you an alien. You would tell me if you were an alien, right?” Evelyn shifted back in her spot, creating some distance between them, smiling the whole time.

 

“I’m not an alien. If I was an alien, you would have nothing to worry about, anyway. Aliens only look for intelligent signs of life.”

 

The two glared at each other before sharing a laugh. Eventually, Evelyn moved back into her spot as they returned their gazes to the forest. The looming trees always gave it an imitating darkness at night, but during the day, all one would see is the peaceful colored birds flying from branch to branch, mixed with the occasional glimpse of a rabbit or other small creature scurrying through the bushes.

  
“Ok, that was funny. For you.” Evelyn said, lounging back a little in her spot on the grass. “Maybe it is just a normal forest. It doesn’t seem scary; it is still a fun mystery.”

 

“Maybe we can solve it one day? We will pack some food and go across. The waters not that deep, so as long as we hold our food up high, it should stay dry.”

 

“Yeah, let’s do that. We can bring a notebook, too.”

 

“Alan, dear? Dinners ready.” Alan’s mother called out from the window, having watched the two children bicker back and forth while she cooked. She enjoyed their wild theories, finding it refreshing to hear whatever made up little stories they came up with.

 

“Ok, Mom. Come on, Evelyn, let’s have dinner and then we can figure out how we are going to explore the forest.”

 

“Got it.”

 

The two rushed to the house, ready to scoff down whatever meal Alan’s mother had prepared, their focus not on the food but on the adventure that awaited them. Unfortunately, the bridge was simply a bridge, something that his family had put in centuries ago to easily carry firewood and food back to the home. The only reason they even stated that they should never rebuild the bridge was because of the stubbornness of the man that had built it. Fergus didn’t want anyone ruining his craftsmanship with faulty repairs or renovations, confident enough that his bridge would stand the test of time, and it did until recently.

 

Despite its initial purpose having faded, it did still serve an important new role for the family. It was a gateway into the world of imagination, a story to share between friends and fuel for the development of a taste for adventure. In a way, Fergus was right. His bridge stood the test of time, for a different reason. He had engraved it into the family’s history.
