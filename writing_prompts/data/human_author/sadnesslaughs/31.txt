“Are you squeaking with excitement, warrior? I too cannot contain myself. To be chosen for such a glorious event is humbling. To think I get to visit a time where all aliens are united over their desire to see their fellow kind pulled apart in bloody competition, it truly makes me ooze with happiness.” The eight-foot purple alien wiped an oozing blue liquid from its forehead. Its rubbery body wiggling as its four fingered hand made contact. Despite its odd appearance, it seemed confident, wearing a grin as it looked over the various other aliens surrounding it.

 

“No… it’s my rubber ducky. Sir squeaks a lot. Is this really a fight to the death? I shouldn’t be here; I was just stolen from my home while gathering a few things for my bath. It’s lucky I’m still dressed.” Brent said, the man dressed in a pair of loose baggy green pants and a white top that had a big, printed picture of a toasted piece of bread.

 

“Rubber ducky? I don’t get it. Is it a weapon?” The alien pressed a finger against the bath toy, only to pull his hand away when it let out a squeak. “Is it going to explode now?”

 

“Why would it explode? You just put it in the bath and watch it float around. It isn’t dangerous at all.”

 

“Why bring it then? Do you plan to choke someone with it? Or maybe you plan to deceive them into lowering their guard before you pierce their two hearts with a Halvia.”

 

“No, that would be awful. Why would I do that? What’s a Halvia, anyway?”

 

“Why would you? Because it’s a fight to the death. How else will you kill them?” At the Halvia question, the alien reached around their back, gripping a heavy metallic weapon. One that looked like a trident but only had two points rather than three.

 

“That looks dangerous”

 

“It is. The weapons made to spear through two hearts, killing the target instantly. Painless, messy, and satisfying to use.” The alien said, close to breaking into an infomercial on the weapon.

 

“What would you do if the person only has one heart?”

 

“One heart? What weak race would only have one heart? I doubt anyone like that would be at a place like this. They don’t let the weak in. However, if the creature had three or more hearts, then I would just keep jabbing them until I win.”

As the two stood among the crowd of aliens, names began to get called out. When the alien heard his, he gave Brent a smack on the back before he rushed forward, screaming. The alien bowling over anyone that was in front of him. Soon he had disappeared from view, his exit being followed by the screams and chants of a waiting crowd outside. Brent inched forward, trying to find the source of the voice.

 

Standing on a small platform above the group was a three-eyed creature with golden skin. They didn’t have any limbs, instead they hovered, moving in a way that was confusing to Brent. When Brent waved his hand to get their attention, they only sighed.

 

“Let me guess, you aren’t meant to be here?”

 

“Exactly. I’m not a warrior, I’m just a guy. I don’t have two hearts or anything. I’m only human.” Brent tried to reason with the alien, who was already ready to dismiss him. Their eyes glanced him over before pausing and looking him over once more.

 

“Huh? A person who actually shouldn’t be here. Never thought that was possible. Sorry for the mix up earthling, may I offer you free tickets to the splash zone? I believe your friend just painted it a delightful shade of red with his weapon.”

 

“No, I just want to go home. Can you send me and Sir squeaks a lot home? I just want to forget this happened.”

 

“Don’t worry, we will erase it from your mind. I’ll send you home, but they have to stay.” The alien’s gaze turned to the rubber ducky, focusing on it.

 

“Why? It’s just some cheap toy I bought.” As the words left Brent’s lips, the rubber ducky rolled off his palm, falling onto the floor. As it landed, its exterior broke open, revealing a small blob of white goo.

 

The goo swirled on the ground for a moment before building into a ball. This ball continuing to expand until it formed a body, one that stood at the same height as Brent. Once it had shaped itself, it changed color and features, slowly mimicking Brent until he was staring at a clone of himself.

“Guess it’s a good time to reveal myself. I’m Valfor, a member of the Pomian intergalactic army. I was part of the invasion group from Earth, as you can see. Guess I got chosen because of my abilities.”

 “Invasion group?”

 

“Oh, yeah. You Earthlings were killing the planet, so we decided we would kill your kind off and claim the planet as our own. We were running out of space on our homeworld so it only made sense. Nothing personal. I was the one that came up with the rubber ducky plan.”

 

“The rubber ducky plan?”

 

“Ah yes, I remember hearing about that.” The three eyed alien said. “That must have been why you were picked. It’s a good plan if I say so myself. You gather their DNA while they bathe and then when your numbers are high enough, you will kill the one that bought you and take over their life, slowly replacing humans with your own kind.”

 

“A fan of mine? I’m flattered.”

 

“Wait? Your kind are in all rubber duckies? How close are you to taking over?”

 

“Maybe a year or two? Depending on how confident we feel. Good luck handling the invasion.” Valfor said as he left the speechless human in his thoughts while he went to prepare for battle.

 

“Ok, I’ll erase your memory and send you back.” The three eyed alien said as their eye glowed with a golden aura, one that made Brent feel lightheaded. The human’s body floating as he was about to be sent back to his time period.

 

“WAIT MAYBE DON’T ERASE-“

 

Suddenly Brent was back at home, standing Infront of an overflowing bathtub. “Must have forgotten about the bath. Can’t believe I let it overflow.” He turned off the taps before looking for Sir squeaks a lot. “Must have dropped him somewhere. Guess I can just buy a new one later.”
