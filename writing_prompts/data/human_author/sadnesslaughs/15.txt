The gunshot tore through Daniel as he fell forward onto the grave, his blood seeping into the dirt before the wound started to heal, spitting the bullet out onto the ground. The momentary sting of pain leaving as he rose to his feet, turning to face his attacker, only to roll his eyes as he realized who it was.

 

“Really? I haven’t seen you in ten years, and that’s how you greet me? You’re lucky I’m not as immature as you are.” Daniel snapped, sliding a finger through the new hole in his white shirt, wondering how he would clean the bloodstain before he got home.

 

“If I had it my way, you would be in the ground beside him. It’s your fault he died. Why would you bring a mortal along with us? What did you think would happen?” Brianna said, stepping past Daniel to lay a small vibrant blue flower by the gravestone.

 

“He didn’t have to come with us. He chose to. I couldn’t have known things would go that badly. You know how much he loved history; he would have gone whether or not I invited him to travel with us. At least he died surrounded by friends. That’s something we will never get to experience.”

 

“Oh, boohoo. At least he died surrounded by friends. What a load of crap. Don’t give me your excuses. He wouldn’t have gone to such a dangerous ruin if you hadn’t shown him where it was. No human would have gone there. We were the only two that knew about it. Admit it, you just wanted him to go so you could brag about that time you were king. Well, how’s it feel, king?”

 

“Lonely. I admit, I may have had my own reasons for wanting him to come along, but I didn’t think it was dangerous. I would never have intentionally put him in harm’s way. It wasn’t like he would have believed I was truly a king, either. I just wanted him to be the one to discover my legacy. He was the only person who wouldn’t make a mockery of what he found inside.”

 

“How noble of you. Maybe you should have done it yourself, or better yet. You could have let us do it alone.”

 

“I couldn’t tell him no; he was too excited. Once he heard about the ruins, he wouldn’t have ever forgiven us if we didn’t take him. I know it sounds rude to say this, but I think he would have been happy to die this way. He got to hear about humanities past from two primary sources, something that barely anyone else will get to experience. For one small moment, he knew more about our past lives than anyone else. I like to think that would have been a euphoric feeling.”

Brianna raised the gun, pointing it again at Daniel. Her hand shaking as she tried to keep a firm grip on the weapon before lowering it once more. Her face scrunching as she did her best to hold back tears. Daniel took a step closer, reaching for her shoulder, only to stop when he saw her flinch.

 

“I’m sorry, Bri. I know you two were close. He really cared for you; I promise. He never shut up about you when we were alone. It was a little annoying, honestly.” Daniel let out a small chuckle, turning back to the grave. “To think a normal person could have touched two immortals in such a way.”

 

“He’s more than just a normal person. He’s Terry Malder, the person who discovered the ruins of east Mavri. There’s nothing normal about someone that could have pulled off such a feat.”

 

“I suppose you’re right. To think he did it all on his own too, if the history books are to be believed. His fearless journey to the ruins being the stuff of legends. To think we knew such a man.”

 

“We were lucky.” Brianna wiped her eyes, moving to Daniel’s side as the two reminisced about their friend. Slowly Brianna’s hatred for her fellow immortal faded as they exchanged stories, recalling the fond period of their lives where they had felt human for the first time in centuries.

 

An hour passed before the two felt the chill of the evening wind. Their visit ending as they both said their last goodbyes to their friend before Daniel turned to Brianna. He didn’t know what to say, electing to embrace her, giving her a quick hug.

 

“You still have my number, don’t you?”

 

“I do, why?”

 

“Well, maybe we can catch up again? Even if we just come to visit Terry together.”

 

“Maybe. I still don’t forgive you for what happened, but I don’t think Terry would want us to fight, either. So, I’m prepared to put this in the past for him.”

 

“That’s good enough for me.” Daniel smiled, giving her a small wave as he went to his car. Leaving Brianna alone with the grave. Brianna endured the cold a little longer, wanting to spend some time alone before she left, promising Terry that she would never forget him for as long as she lives.
