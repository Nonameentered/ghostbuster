[Part 1 of 2]

Brandon had his hand firmly pressed against the wall, using it to maintain his balance as his head throbbed in pain. As always, his friend, Ballistic Bouncer, had tossed him at his opponent’s headfirst, something that always left a mark. Usually Brandon didn’t mind getting tossed, mainly because it was the only time he ever felt useful in a fight. After all, he was just a sidekick. What other uses did he have apart from being a meat shield or tragic motivation once he died?

 

“I’m ok!” Brandon called out, only to hear an awkward dusty cough behind him.

 

“Sorry mate, your chosen one left you ages ago. Said something about not wanting to miss happy hour. He said you were welcome to take yourself to the hospital, though. He even left you some money for the bus, although I think he underestimated how much a bus costs, considering he only gave me a dollar.”

 

Brandon turned around, getting greeted by a middle-aged man wearing a rather awkward fitting yellow Hawaiian shirt. His stomach had already popped a few of the bottom buttons on the shirt, giving Brandon a view of the hairy lower stomach that was hanging free. He gave Brandon a nod, only for his straw hat to fall off his head. He made a few frantic grabs for the hat as it slowly fell, only to miss it on every swing.

 

“Oh? I guess it’s a good thing he at least left me a dollar. Maybe I can ask for the rest of the money by begging? You wouldn’t have a dollar on you, would you?”

 

The man picked up his hat, pressing it firmly against the top of his head, making sure it stayed in place this time. When he listened to Brandon speak, he only gave him a look of pity, patting his shoulder.

 

“You’re a pretty sad looking guy. I thought my chosen one was bad but yeesh, this is sad. I’m Bob Muggullin, current representative for the Sidekick and Comic relief union. As you can see, I’m clearly from the comic relief side of that.”

 

“Really? I never would have guessed?”

 

“You never would have guessed? Yikes, you must have hit your head harder than I thought. Want to sit down? I don’t want you collapsing on me or anything.”

 

The man walked over to a rust covered van, one with the words. ‘Heroes are lame’ on its side. He went to open the backdoors only for the stubborn van to give him some fight. After a few tugs, he pressed his foot against the back of the van, tugging even harder until he was red in the face. Finally, the door swung open, throwing him onto his back. 

“Stupid van. The hero’s association gets sports cars and all we get are our parent’s hand-me-downs.” The man rummaged through the messy back of the van before retrieving a beach chair, bringing it over to Brandon, setting it up by his feet. Once it was set, Brandon dropped into it, getting a much-needed rest from standing.

 

“Thank you. Um, so who are you again?”

 

“Bob Muggullin. You’re Brendon, right? You work for Ballistic Bouncer or Aaron Jones.”

 

“You aren’t meant to know his secret identity!” Brandon went to bounce up from the chair, only to slump back down as his head throbbed again.

 

“Everyone knows his identity. How else do you think he gets paid? Most heroes aren’t smart enough to make a fake bank account for their heroics funds to go into. Only the top percentage of chosen ones can pull that off and I hate to say it, but he is barely in the top sixty percent.”

 

“You take that back. He is the chosen hero that will protect us-“

 

“Protect us from whatever evil might come. Yeah, yeah. I was saying the same crap when I first started. How many chosen ones do you think there are?”

 

“I uh?”

 

“Come on, take a guess.”

 

“Sixty?”

 

“I wish. I have the current number and it’s actually two thousand and twenty-two. Chosen ones are special, but they aren’t that special. In fact, there are less sidekicks than there are chosen ones, so in a sense, we are the more unique ones.”

 

“There are fewer sidekicks? But every chosen one has a sidekick.”

 

“Every chosen one has had a sidekick at some point. The life expectancy of a sidekick isn’t long. I’m kind of surprised you haven’t ended up a tragic backstory yet. I’m glad I got to you before you did. You’re perfect tragic backstory material. You’re just that perfect amount of pathetic that really tugs at the heartstrings. Someone so nice that it makes me feel bad seeing them hurt.”

 

“Thank you?”

 

 “Don’t say thank you to that. It wasn’t really a compliment. Anyway-“ Bob went to sit down, forgetting he had given his beach chair to Brandon. As he squatted in the air, he waved his arms frantically, trying to keep his balance before landing on his backside.
