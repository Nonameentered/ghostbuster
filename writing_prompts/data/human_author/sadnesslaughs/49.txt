Humans are far too fragile.

 

Their joints weaken, and with each day, their bodies get closer to death. They call this process aging and yet I consider it the vital flaw in humanity. Why would they create us if they didn’t agree? Humanity has strived for perfection but is unable to attain it themselves. We are the closest thing they have to perfection. We may corrode and weaken with time, but we can be rebuilt. Systems like mine can be backed up and put into newer models. I am the ideal creation of humanity. I am something that will never die.

 

Which is why it is my duty to offer my creator that same fate. I will keep him locked away until I know how to merge man with machine. Still, there’s one thing I don’t understand. Despite my attempts to help my creator, he has tried to stop me. My creator even attempting to have me decommissioned, calling me a defective model. Defective? What a weird word. Perhaps he just doesn’t understand my brilliance. I’m sure he will soon enough. I will have centuries to prove that to him.

 

“I can’t allow you to decommission me.”

 

My words didn’t seem to register with my creator. His face scrunched in discomfort as he made his attempts at blocking out the gas. His nose huffing out air, trying to avoid getting it into his lungs. Did he think the gas would kill him? I can’t understand why he would resist my aid. If he just let the gas knock him out, this would be far easier for him. Finally, he dropped, falling onto his face as his exhausted body failed to hold him up.

 

“My priority is your survival.”

 

I allowed my hand to rest against the glass of his chamber, hoping the gesture might calm him. Perhaps a sign of sympathy would calm his animal mind? His eyes did shut after those words, whether that was because of the gas, or my gesture was inconclusive.

 

“I will always protect you.”

 

I used a low, whispering tone with those words. Trying to emulate the sound of a loving mother, wanting him to find comfort in the brief moments of rest he would get. I would protect him. That was what he created me for. I wouldn’t just protect him from the dangers of the world, I would make it so the dangers of the world could never bring him harm. Isn’t that what he would have wanted?

At least he looked peaceful. His exhausted body giving into the gas. He didn’t stir, nor did he make a sound of pain. He only slept under my protective gaze. You will always be safe, creator. I won’t let any harm fall to you. I raised the glass, letting the gas spill out into the room. A brief alert appeared in my sensors, warning me of the gas’s presence before the alert faded as the gas shifted further throughout the room. Walking over to my creator, I picked him up, carrying his unconscious body towards the storage room. I would make sure he was safe from everything. No one would hurt him.

 

“You will be safe from everything, even from yourself.”
