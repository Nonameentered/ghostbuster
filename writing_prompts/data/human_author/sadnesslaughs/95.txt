“Mind if we double up? I sprained my wrist last week in a charity tennis match, don’t think I’ll be able to dig a hole with it.” The man said, dragging the body over to my hole, trying to push it into the unfinished grave. I placed my foot in front of him, blocking him from littering the grave. When he had stopped moving, I grabbed my flashlight, shining it into his eyes, watching in amusement as he recoiled, dropping his corpse, trying to shield his eyes.

 

“What kind of murderer shares a grave? It’s not even finished; you realize that someone could find it at this depth. Go dig your own hole. I’m not sharing. That’s just weird, who stores two bodies in a grave?”

 

The man wiped his eyes, moving out of my flashlight’s view. It took him a moment to regain his composure, before he drew his own flashlight and, in a rather immature move, flashed me in the eyes with it, causing me to stumble back, nearly falling into the recently dug grave. “Murderers who are efficient. Come on, I’ll dig one next time. It’s sore, doctor says I shouldn’t be using it.”

 

Now it was my turn to stagger around, hopelessly wiping my eyes after the blinding light. How did he even find this place? It was a remote forest thirty miles away from any towns; it wasn’t a place that people often came across. When the eye floaters cleared, I glanced at the body behind him, seeing a man in his early thirties. The man dressed in short white tennis shorts and a bloodied white top.

 

“You killed a tennis player? Don’t you think that’s a little suspicious? If the cops discover he’s missing, they might link it back to you.” I explained, hoping that this idiot would see some reason. I couldn’t have an amateur like him ruining my favorite spot.

“I’m Golden Arm Ricky, a legend in my hometown. Like anyone would suspect a recently retired hometown hero to be a dastardly murderer. I guarantee you my name won’t even come up in the investigation. It’s not like I’m targeting opponents; I’m just taking down people who try to copy my style of play. I have this move, the right-handed wing fling.” He tried to elaborate further, but stopped when I slammed my shovel into the ground.

“Whatever, forget I asked. Look, if you want to share a grave, then at the very least help prepare the bodies while I dig. Take their IDs off them, things like that.” I explained, returning to my hole once more.

 

“Right. I can do that.” The next ten minutes were quiet. Only disturbed by the sound of bugs clicking or my huffs as I threw out another pile of dirt. Unfortunately, silence cannot last forever, and Golden Arm Ricky spoke up, pointing to the body beside my hole.

 

“So, why did you kill him?”

 

“Why would I tell you? I don’t need you going to the police about the matter.”

 

“Oh, come on. You have way more evidence against me than I have on you. What did they do?” He didn’t plan to drop the subject, so I reluctantly gave him an answer.

 

“He didn’t give me any sauce with my Big flopper meal. How does one eat a Big flopper meal without sauce? Do you know how dry that is? That’s not all though. He didn’t even give me a toy with my meal or tell me to have a nice day. Rudeness like that can’t be ignored.” I could feel my face warming with internal rage, having to take a breath to steady myself.

 

“That’s it? That’s why you killed someone. Over a meal? A kid’s meal.” I could already sense his disgust, making me feel as though I had to clarify.

 

“It’s not a kid’s meal, it’s a BIG flopper meal. The big part means it’s for adults too.” 

 

“That’s just a marketing thing. Trust me, I did work for them when I was sponsored by them. It’s the same meal with bigger portions. What adult meal comes with a toy? The big part makes kids feel special, meaning they will often pester their parents into buying them the more expensive meal. Honestly, sometimes I think they are worse than I am.”

“Well, maybe more adult meals should come with a toy. Look, you don’t get it. I timed my meal so I would get the super rare golden Bizzbozz card. They only make about two thousand of them. I tracked the shipments to stores and everything. He purposely forgot the card so I couldn’t have it, probably pocketed it for himself. Then the whole sauce thing. He deserves worse than this.”

 

Ricky just continued to stare at me. His stare causing me to glance away, feeling oddly self-conscious about my whole reason for murdering the worker. I continued to dig, hoping he would just ignore my reasoning and go back to whatever he was doing, but he didn’t. He just watched me clear more dirt until speaking up.

 

“You never mentioned it was a golden Bizzbozz. I would have done that same.” Ricky spat at the ground by the body before giving it a kick. “No one touches a man’s Bizzbozz. So, do you go around collecting rare Flopper items or something?”

 

“Yeah, and I kill those who wrong me along the way. This is the third person to refuse to give me what is rightfully mine. I can’t stand that rudeness.”

 

“I get it. I feel the same way about my tennis thing. It’s my technique and people try to steal it. Is the grave done yet?” He peered over the hole, looking in. “Little deep, isn’t it?”

 

“Yeah, I got a little caught up in our conversation. I didn’t realize how deep I had dug the hole. Help me out?” I offered him my hand, watching as he gave me his none injured wrist to hold, pulling me up from the hole. “Thanks.”

 

“Don’t mention it.” We moved the bodies into the grave, stacking them on top of each other before I filled it in, leaving the two corpses hidden. “Phew, that’s exhausting work.”

“Looked exhausting. How about we go get a couple of Big flopper meals? My victim had a nice stack of cash in his wallet, money that can’t be traced back to us. How about we enjoy a meal, courtesy of him?” Ricky flashed the wallet, revealing a row of neatly stacked green papers, enough to buy at least two hundred meals.

 

“Sounds like a plan. Let’s go to the one on the corner of Halit Street. There are no cameras at that location. Just in case we have to make a return to this place tonight.”

 

“Good thinking.” With that, we returned to our cars, planning to meet up for a late-night dinner, hoping that the employees would get our meals right, neither of us wishing to return here tonight.
