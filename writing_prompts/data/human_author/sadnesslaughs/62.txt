“We can’t all be special.”

 

Of all the things my mother told me, that was the one that had embedded itself deep into my mind. I was the second born out of three siblings. My older brother Mavat, being the one they considered the chosen one, only because he squirmed his way out first. How that made him anymore special than the rest of us, who knows.

 

Maybe he was the chosen one. I couldn’t prove that he wasn’t and neither me nor my sister Polly had shown any signs of being remarkable. Polly, bless her soul, had moved on from the silliness of prophecy and settled down with a lovely son of a farmer. Last I spoke to her, she was happy, finding meaning in the toiling of farmland while I clung to the bitterness of being normal.

 

She would often tell me to find someone to settle down with. Maybe a relationship would give me meaning? Maybe, but I didn’t have any motivation to seek a purpose, not when the destiny I wanted had been stolen from me at birth. Like a child tossing out all his toys because he lost his favorite. I refused to accept anything but the best.

 

My idle thoughts were broken when a guard gave my chest a nudge, snapping me into reality.

 

“You know this is a private road, don’t you sir?” The sir oozed with sarcasm, his pointed spear held tightly at his side, ready to be thrusted forward on a moment’s notice. I made no sudden movements, instead I held my hands near my chest, showing I had nothing hidden in my palm.

 

“I do. My brother Mavat lives down this road. I was hoping to speak to him.” I gave the guard a smile which was only met with scorn.

 

“Right. Who are you then?”

 

“Aren.”

 

“Aren? That sounds familiar.” He motioned over another guard to his side, whispering something to the man. The man gave a nod and climbed atop his horse, heading towards the manor.

 

“Just going to confirm that with Mavat, if he says you can come in, you can come in.”

 

“If he says I can come in? Who do you think you are? This manor belongs to my family. I have every right to be here. I shouldn’t even need your permission to go inside.” My hand pressed against his armored chest, gripping at the collar. The guard, in response, smacked his spear against the dirt, causing me to loosen my grip.

“Legally, the manor isn’t yours. When your mother passed, she left it to Mavat. I assume you know that if you are his family.”

 

“I lived in that manor until I was an adult. You can take whatever deed he has and shove it right up your-“

 

“BROTHER.” A cheerful voice rang out. Mavat came riding out on a pure white horse, his arms held wide in a warm greeting. “I wish you had told me you were coming; I would have prepared a meal. Tell me, how’s Polly?”

 

“Why don’t you go ask her? I’m sure she would love a visit from you, considering we aren’t allowed to come visit you anymore.” I didn’t bother hiding my disdain, eyeing the guard in front of me as he only gripped his spear tighter in response.

 

“Now, now, Henry, my brother has a right to be agitated. I understand you are angry about the manor being given to me, but I assure you, I will welcome you here anytime. It was all precautionary. I am a targeted man now.”

 

The guard relaxed at Mavat’s words, even stepping aside, allowing me to get closer to my brother.

 

“I don’t feel very welcomed. Do you always welcome your guests with guards? I bet if I were a noble, you wouldn’t be treating me like this. Does your brother not command enough respect to be allowed to come and go as he pleases? Why did you even get the manor? You were barely home. You were off studying under the best tutors available while me and sis just got left with whatever scraps of books weren’t fit for you.”

 

“Brother. It isn’t like that. I have a responsibility to the world. If a darkness attacks, I’m the one that has to fight it. It isn’t a life I would wish upon anyone. Is this about money? Do you want me to lend you gold?” He reached for his coin pouch, only to stop as I spat at his horses’ hooves. 

“You would love that, wouldn’t you? Being able to pay me off so you can feel better about yourself. Do you want to see me grovel at your feet and beg for it, too? The manor should be ours; I should have gotten an opportunity to be better like you did. You aren’t special. You were just lucky.” Every bitter word I had stored up spilled from my lips, unable to stop myself.

 

“Brother…” He let out a sigh, giving me a look of pity as he turned his gaze back to the manor. “If you wanted to be better, you should have spent less time holding a grudge over destiny. I doubt Polly is behaving like a spoilt brat. I’m sorry, but I have to go. Please come back when you have calmed down. Maybe then we can speak.”

 

He turned to leave, ready to head down the pathway back to our manor. In a fit of rage that surprised me, I bent down and scooped up a rock from the ground, tossing it at the back of his head. I heard that satisfying clunk before he fell from his horse. Immediately, I was tackled by his guard, pinned to the ground. Watching as my brother slowly picked himself up, holding the bloodied back of his head.  

 

“Take him to the dungeons to cool down. I don’t want him taking that anger out on someone and getting himself in trouble. Aren, I’m doing this for your own good. I’ll let you out when you have slept off that anger.”

 

“Sending your brother to the dungeons? Is that how you treat family? Should Polly be worried next? You’re a coward. I hope that wound gets infected. Come and drag me to the dungeons yourself.” I kicked as the guards pulled me along, doing whatever I could to break free, but to no avail.

 

I didn’t sleep the whole time I was in the dungeons. I just stewed in my anger, staring at the other tormented souls in the dungeon. A few of them smirked at me, probably having been told by the guards that I was the brother of Mavat and that he had personally sent me down here.

 

“Ooooh, look at ye, a fancy manor living creature down here with the rest of us leeches. Welcome, let me give ye a tour. That’s the bars, and that’s the bucket we-“

 

“Shut up. The manor isn’t mine. I live in a tavern. It’s only slightly better than whatever hole your crawled out from.” The old man who had been taunting me went quiet for a moment, considering his next response. 

“Pfft, he got ye by the family jewels then. He plucked em right off ye and left ye with nothing.” That caused the rest of the prisoners to laugh, as the old man’s near toothless grin only widened now that he had an audience. “Is he going to take everything from ye? Maybe we should rob ye when we get out if ye are such an easy target.” Even if it was a joke, there were a few prisoners considering that. I might not by rich by noble standards, but to them. A gold coin was a gold coin, no matter which bloodied pocket they pulled it from.

 

“QUIET DOWN, QUIET DOWN.” A guard called out as footsteps approached the cells. Sheepishly, my brother stepped into the dungeon, his hand rubbing against his brown hair, not looking me in the eye as he stopped before my cell.

 

“I’m sorry, brother. I don’t know what came over me. Mother would be ashamed of us if she were still alive. I can’t offer you the manor, but I can offer my sincerest apologies. You had some valid points. I even went and spoke to Polly like you suggested. She’s doing well, our sister, to think she’s already settled down.” He gave a laugh, expecting me to join in his jolly laughter, but I only remained silent.

 

“Are you going to let me out now? Or do I have to apologize too?”

 

“It would be nice if you did, but I won’t make you. Brother, please don’t become a person who causes problems. I do care for you.”

 

“Then look at me.”

 

“What?”

 

“Look at me when you are speaking to me.” Despite my words, he didn’t turn his head. He only motioned the guards towards the cell doors, silently telling them to release me.

 

“I’m sorry. It’s not out of disrespect, it’s out of my own feelings of embarrassment. My offer still stands if you wish to speak to me.” With that, he was gone, and my cell was opened.

 

“Aww, ye brother came to save ye. Can ye ask him to save us too? Must be nice being so loved.” The old man teased. I approached his cell as I left, turning to face him.

 

“Enjoy the rest of your time here.” I replied, earning a small grumbled swear in response. Heading out of the dungeon, the blinding sun hit me, having to cover my eyes. How long had it been? Probably a day at longest, maybe less. All I knew was I needed a drink.
