[Part 1 of 2]

“I thought there would be more celebrities. This just looks like a regular bar; booze even tastes just as crappy. I was told this was a special place where the seven worlds collided and the dimensions shift to create wonder beyond our wildest dreams.” Eric said. The camera around his neck waving back and forth, following the grand gestures he was making with his hands.

 

“Who told you that crap? It’s a bar that people sometimes find their way into. It isn’t some conspiracy, it’s just a bar that’s lost to time itself. That’s the problem with you time hoppers. You all puff each other up with these grand stories only to get disappointed when met with the reality of it all.”

 

“Yes, but it’s a bar lost to time. There should be ancient kings, heroes, villains, politicians, and celebrities. How am I ever going to sell the headline now? You know how expensive it is to get here?”

 

Mack the bartender groaned, already bored with the conversation. Every week, another time hopper would appear, and he would have to have this same repetitive conversation again and again. Sometimes they were hopping for a profit while others were just spoilt rich kids who were using their parent’s money to brag about how they took a photo with some king that they probably couldn’t pronounce the name of. At the mention of how much it costs to hop, he just shrugged.

 

“How would I know? It’s in the future. Why do you think I have someone that exchanges currencies for little plastic drink chips? It would be far too hard to learn every conceivable currency, so I just get someone else to handle it. That way, people don’t spend all day telling me they are underpaying or overpaying for drinks.”

 

“Well, it’s a lot of money, just so you know. Are you sure there isn’t someone of interest you can introduce me to? I’ll take even a minor historical figure, someone that barely gets on the history books. I desperately need a big payday. Do you know how much it costs to afford an apartment in the future?”

 

“Again, how would I know?”

 

Mack glanced around the pub, looking over the worn-out barstools and peeling walls, trying to find someone else for the journalist to bother. He found a group of roman soldiers playing pool, something he found amusing but probably not worth mentioning to the man. Maybe he could point him towards the viking warrior who was throwing her axe at the dartboard. 

“HEY, WHAT DID I SAY ABOUT THROWING YOUR AXE AT THE DARTBOARD? We have darts for a reason.” The viking warrior turned around, staring at the bartender before raising her drink with a smile, not understanding a single word he said. Mack pointed to the box of darts beside her, and she only responded by pointing to her axe. Once he realized their game of charades was going nowhere, he sighed and went back to his inspection of the place.

 

The place was falling apart, mainly because everyone that came here just did whatever the hell they wanted. It was hard to maintain order in a pub like this. With so many time periods and clashing styles, it became impossible for him to maintain order. Sometimes he was lucky and his currency exchanging alien buddy would help him translate his words, but he was often too busy with his own work to lend a hand. Then it hit him. He could tell the journalist about Xil.

 

“Why don’t you interview the wonderful Xil? He’s a brilliant look into the universe. He even knows every language that’s ever been spoken. Well, he doesn’t know them all yet, but he learns them just by hearing someone speak it. So, technically, he knows all languages, you know?”

 

“What the little Gordax fellow? We have those in our timeline. He is remarkably smart, even for his kind, but he isn’t interesting enough to write a story about. I have to ask, how did you convince him to stay here?”

 

“He’s an alcoholic.”

 

“Oh?”

 

“Yeah, there’s no funny story about it, really. He just likes to drink, and I can use the help. Before he came, I had to use the barter system, and that was a mess. You try working out the exchange rate for gold bars to vodka. Don’t get me started on how many beers a chicken will get you.” Mack dragged his palm against his forehead, wiping off a few droplets of sweat. “This place is a mess.”

 

“It is. I thought with much money you make; you would have enough to renovate a little more.”

 

“I used to do repairs and renovations weekly, but it’s impossible to repair this place faster than people break it. So, I just do yearly repairs now, saves money.” Mack wiped the counter, watching as the condensation slipped in between the cracks on the bar counter.

“That’s rather sad. How’s the food here? You have a grill, right?”

“Had a grill. It’s just a vending machine filled with expired food now. I used to run the kitchen, but it’s hard to find workers that want to abandon their timelines to live here. Once you leave, it’s impossible to return. Unless you timehop, but most people don’t have that technology. So, can I take your order?”

 

Mack pushed forward a laminated menu that had only three items. One was a cheese and something sandwich. The meat being crossed out in a black marker since Mack could no longer identify what it had been. A crunchy nut salted blast candy bar and a can of Flushy Floo blueberry swish.

 

“Can’t I just use the vending machine myself?”

 

“With your money? It only accepts Trinkles. Unless you have any of them on you, I’ll have to get it.”

 

“I think I’ll pass, anyway. None of that sounds edible.”

 

“Excellent choice. You just saved your timelines doctors the hassle of pumping your stomach.”

 

Eric went to lean against the counter, only to stop when he saw the mess of liquid on it. Instead, he just lowered his head, looking at his camera that still had plenty of storage left. Not to mention a few hologram films he could use. He had given up on finding someone interesting, taking his camera off his neck and placing it in his bag. He slid a plastic chip over to the bartender, ordering another vodka and raspberry.

 

“So, how did you end up here?”
