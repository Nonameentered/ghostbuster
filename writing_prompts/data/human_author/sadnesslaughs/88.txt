The warm flickers of the flame offered comfort in the chilly night. My hands outstretched towards the fire, trapping the heat between my fingers, trying to keep my body heat. The others had gone to bed, leaving me to watch the dying flames waiting for their light to extinguish. As a stray yawn left my lips, goosebumps surfaced along my arms, accompanied by a feeling of dread. Such a feeling was common at night, but this felt more sinister, as though it were more real than the strange imaginings of my mind.

 

My hands shifted together, rubbing with added intensity, trying to soothe the growing discomfort. Suddenly, the warmth of the fire did nothing more than offer a small sanctuary of safety from the ever-suffocating darkness of my property. Unable to seek comfort in its warmth like I previously had.

 

“Greetings.” A raspy voice spoke up. I was certain the voice had come from the street and yet I couldn’t see anyone under the streetlights. I rose from my chair, trying to get a better view of the stranger, but no matter where my gaze went, I could not spot them.

 

Maybe it was a group of teenagers trying to scare me? I knew having the campfire set up on my front lawn was a bad idea. It just invited weirdos to come and bother me. My foot tapped against the ground, trying to tire out my anxieties as I sat down again, praying that it was all in my head.

 

“May I share your fire tonight?” As those words were spoken, a pair of deep, ruby colored eyes opened in the distance. In the darkness, I couldn’t make out anything other than their eyes, forced to stare into their gaze as they patiently waited for my answer.

 

“Excuse me? This is private property.” Were they standing on my property? How could I even tell? They were still a few feet away from me, observing me from a distance. Maybe they were still on the street?

 

“I understand, which is why I’m asking for permission to join you. That fire will die out soon. I was hoping to warm my body before that happens. If you would be kind enough to let me join you.”

 

Nothing about their tone sounded threatening. I made a motion with my hand, silently telling them to join me. Despite my motions, they refused to move from their spot, still gazing in my direction, not even blinking.

“Please tell me I can join you.”

 

“You can join me?” Even with my confusion, that was enough of an invitation for the stranger. They made their way over to the flames and found themselves a chair. With the light of the campfire now on them, I could see more of their body.

She was tall, that much was obvious given how she stared down at me, her wrinkled face holding a smile as she placed her worn, skeletal fingers on the embers, stealing whatever warmth she could from them. “Thank you. It’s rare to find someone that would be so trusting of a stranger. I’m Victoria.”

 

I didn’t respond at first, lost in the red pits of her eyes. Something about them held my attention, only able to pull myself away when she blinked. “I’m Luke. I don’t mean to be rude, but is it safe for an older woman like you to be out this late?” My attempt at being tactful failed, her face only stirring into a frown as she twisted her fingers near the embers, warming the back of her hands.

 

“Perhaps not, but I enjoy a midnight walk. It’s one of the rare times I’m allowed to be outside. So, why are you out here alone? I thought a handsome man like you would have a partner to share this with.”

 

“A partner? Oh, no. I wish. I was just spending the night outside with my friends. We like to have a fire. It helps give us something to do. They ended up getting tired, so I offered to extinguish the fire for them. Guess I got a little distracted.”

 

“No partner? I have a daughter you would like.” Victoria considered before letting out a dry laugh. “Are my walking habits your only concern? Usually people mention my eyes.”

 

It was true. Her eyes were strange and still I felt compelled not to ask about them. Whether it was out of fear or a worry that bringing up such a thing would be a touchy subject. “I admit, it has crossed my mind, but I didn’t want to offend you.”

 

“You’re a kind soul, a little dimwitted, but kind. I will spare you tonight. Do you know about the witching hour?” Her eyes dulled, returning to a normal blue and suddenly I felt awake, as though that cloudy haze of confusion had fled.

“The hour is nearly over; I intend to go home. Just so you know, Luke. I intended to kill you tonight. I was only waiting for you to mention my eyes. Most of us have a method to our monstrous nature. I wait for my victims to point out my eyes before trapping them inside, making them watch as I lure others into the same fate as them. You got lucky. If you wish to try that luck again, keep camping like this. Maybe you will enter the witching hour again.”

 I awoke to the dying flame at my feet, its warmth long since fading. “What a strange dream. I can’t believe I dozed off.” I found myself a bucket, filling it with water and dousing the remains of the flame. “There, that should do it. I really should go to bed. It’s creepy sleeping outside. Anyone could have just walked over to me.”

As I headed inside, I tried to piece together the remnants of the dream. There was an old woman and some strange eyes? That was about as much as I could piece together. Well, that and the fact that if I wanted to see her, I needed to set up a campfire again. I’m sure my friends would love to hear that story the next time we did this. Maybe I might even see her again. I chuckled at the thought, certain the story would scare at least one of them.
