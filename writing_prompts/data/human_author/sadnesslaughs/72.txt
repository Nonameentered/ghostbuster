“DO DO DO DO DO DO DO DO.” The door to my closet shook, rattling with the sounds of European techno music. As the door rattled, the odd spotlight would slip through the fine cracks in the door, blasting my face with the blinding white light. “LASS DEN BEAT FALLEN.” The song shouted before the repetition of the dull Do sounds littered the air once more.

 

I turned over in my bed, trying to hide my head in the pillow. Maybe If I stopped thinking about the skeletons in my closet, I could get some sleep. I pressed my eyes shut, trying to think about anything other than the skeletons, but with each passing second, I fixated on them. Why did they have to be so loud?

 

“SHUT UP.” I sat up, tossing a pillow at the door, watching it bounce off the door with little impact, leaving me without something to lay my head on. “Stupid skeletons, do you know how late it is? I have work tomorrow. I bet half of you wouldn’t even exist if I could get to sleep at an appropriate time.” The music drowned my words out, its loud beats mocking me.

 

“La lueur monte au fur et à mesure que le rythme diminue.” The song said, in a way that only infuriated me further. I couldn’t even understand the stupid songs, which only made it worse.

 

Getting out of bed, I pounded my fist against the door. “HEY, I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME. TURN YOUR MUSIC DOWN.” My angry knocks only grew in volume until the door pulled open, revealing a skeletal head with a pair of 2022 sunglasses on.

 

“Yo, why are you bringing down the mood? We are just trying to have a little fun, your closets boring. There’s nothing else to do here. Don’t worry, the party stops at 4am. Can you just wait until then?” The skeleton asked, hopeful that I would let this party continue.

 

“Of course, I can’t. I told you, I need to get to bed. Do you think my boss is going to believe me if I tell him I was up all night because of the skeletons in my closet?”

 

“I think he would. Everyone has skeletons in their closet, just some people don’t have as many as you do. It’s a little depressing seeing how many you have. That’s why we have a disco. No one can be depressed at a disco. I would invite you in, but it’s only for skeletons. If you take off your skin, you’re more than welcome.” The skeleton offered, making that sound like a simple task.

“I can’t take off my skin. Just get out of my closet. I’m sick of being unable to sleep. What do you think this does to a person?”

 

“I don’t know. I don’t sleep. You really want us gone? I guess we could leave.” As the skeleton said that, another popped their head through the door. This one is wearing a fake silver moustache.

 

“Is this the person who gets scared of moths? What a silly thing to get scared of. You know they can’t actually hurt you, right?”

 

“But they always fly at me. It doesn’t matter if they can hurt me or not, it’s creepy. How do you know that, anyway?”

 

“We are your skeletons. It’s our job to know everything. We can leave, but if we leave. Everyone will know everything that you have been keeping bottled up. All those little quirks of yours and those embarrassing secrets will all be made public.” The 2022 glasses wearing skeleton went to step out of the closet, only to get shoved back in by me.

 

“S-stay inside then. Don’t even think about coming out. I don’t want people to hate me. Just stay hidden and try to be quiet, please?” As I pushed on the door, I could see the other skeletons littering the interior, each staring at me with amused open jaws. Each carrying some hidden shame.

 

“Are you sure? If you insist. Don’t worry, only three more hours until 4am. I’m sure you can wait.” With that, the door shut, and the music started again. All I could hear was that same rhythm they forced me to listen to every night. I gathered my pillow before falling back onto the bed, hiding my tired face against it. Maybe things were better this way.
