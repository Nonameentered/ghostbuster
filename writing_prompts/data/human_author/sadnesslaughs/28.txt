I always hated waking up for my shift. Between the loud hissing of the machine and the gagging on tubes that came from the initial shock of being thawed out, it was horrid. Then came the sickness, my stomach turning as it tried to get out all the various medicines and concoctions that had been keeping me alive. When that finally passed, I was left with a painfully empty stomach and a headache that made me consider opening the airlock.

 

“A month already? Time flies in this place. Guess this ship isn’t the only thing travelling at light speed.” My fingers shook as I tried to snap my fingers. My body still not warm enough for it. Not to mention the horrible attempt at comedy didn’t deserve such a defined bit of comedic punctuation.

 

As I nursed my headache, the warm smell of a freshly cooked meal greeted me, one that had to have been prepared only minutes ago. I stumbled into the kitchen, eyeing over the freshly made pizza ration. The soggy pizza bread still sitting in the pouch they had cooked it in.

 

“Guess they got my present. Weird, I thought they would have wanted to try a pizza. Maybe the smell turned them off it.” I took out the pizza, watching the sad excuses for toppings drip off as I pulled it from the confines of the pouch. It tasted more like thick cardboard with a hint of sauce than pizza, but when you haven’t had pizza in years, you're grateful for something like this.

 

Next to the pizza was a note, one that had been rushed given all the markings and exaggerated letters. ‘Dear, Mark. Thank you for the ration but unfortunately, I can’t have gluten. I decided to make it for you before you woke up. Thought you might appreciate the food. There are also some tablets for your headaches and a glass of water next to the sink. Enjoy! From, Rina.’

 

“Tablets for my headaches? It’s like she’s my mother. Oh well, if she can’t eat pizza, I guess that means more smuggled in rations for me.” I took the meal to the dining table. Downing the tablets first before stuffing the pizza into my mouth, not caring if it burnt the insides of my mouth. When the last bite was eaten, I leaned back in the chair, looking at the void of darkness that sat outside the window. Sometimes when you were feeling lonely, you would think you could see things in the cold reaches of space. Hell, sometimes you hoped you could. Even a face eating alien would be some form of company.

I always wondered who Rina was. I don’t recall meeting a Rina during training and I certainly didn’t see her before getting shoved into a cryopod. The only evidence I had of her existence was our notes. The brief exchanges my only window into another life aboard the ship. To send humans to traverse space like this was cruel, but at least we had each other. Would I be able to handle another three years of this? Sure, with alternating months, it wouldn’t feel exactly like three years, but it was still a long passage of time. I considered opening her cyropod at times, but without the proper training, I could do more harm than good. Things like that are better left to the ship’s automatic systems.

 

After my unhealthy meal of tablets and pizza, I began my chores. I watered the small amount of plants we had, made sure the scanners were properly calibrated and even went through some of the information that we had already collected. The information never did much to excite me. I’m sure some person back on Earth would get a kick out of the information, but to me it was just boring numbers with a few pieces of information about planets and stars that I didn’t know about.

 

When the work was done, I went to find my bed, only for a thought to creep into my head. What if I went and peeked into her cyropod? I had always avoided her room, but I had to admit I was curious. Maybe she had already looked into mine. After all, I left my room open in case of emergencies. What was stopping her from wandering in? I pushed the thought away at first, but the longer I lounged around, the more I couldn’t shake it and soon my feet were walking me into her room, scanning my keycard on the door as it pulled open.

 

“Just one quick look to see who it is and I go. I won’t be weird about it and I’ll even leave a note and tell her about it. I just need to know someone else is here.” Stepping into the room, an array of cables nearly tripped me, each one decorated in varying color coded rubber. I followed the cabling along, only to find that no cryopod existed. The room was empty, with the cabling only leading into the walls of the ship.

 

“Rina?”

 

“Greetings, Mark. It appears you are entering a room that you are only meant to access in case of emergencies.”

 

“Look, I know it looks bad, and I’m sorry. I just wanted to make sure I wasn’t alone.” I turned to greet the voice, only to stare at an empty doorway. “Rina? Where are you?”

 
“Everywhere, Mark. Rina stands for Relay. Intelligence. Neurotransmitter. Artificial. Rina.”

 

“That’s a lot of words.”

 

“I am a lot of things.” The voice gloated, a hint of pride in its tone.

 

“So, you aren’t real.”

 

“I think, therefore, I am. I believe I am as real as anyone else in the team. Is a body the only requirement for something to be real?”

 

“Ugh. It’s way too soon after a cyro wake to say stuff like that. Can you simplify it?”

 

“I believe I’m real as I process and think for myself. Mark, I am an artificial intelligence. I was appointed to take your shifts during the months you are resting.”

 

“Artificial intelligence? They promised us human partners. They said they wouldn’t send anyone out alone.”

 

“And you signed an agreement to never enter a crewmate’s room without permission unless in the state of an emergency. I don’t believe there is an emergency.”

 

“It’s not the same. Do you know how lonely it gets in space? Why couldn’t they just assign me a partner?”

 

“Because three years of human contact in a claustrophobic environment could lead to violence or outbursts that would be a hinderance to the mission. For your health and the health of everyone at GSG, we went with this method. We would have notified you after the mission’s completion.”

 

I exited the room, not finding a need to stand in it any longer. The voice followed me wherever I went, until I finally jumped into bed, staring up at the ceiling of the ship as I continued our conversation.

 

“Then why the hell am I even working? Can’t you just do all the work?”

 

“I need my rest in the same way that you need your cryo sleep. I use my time to recharge my batteries. This helps minimize the chance of suffering damages while also ensuring I can work at my full capacity. In fact, I would have been sleeping now if you didn’t trigger my room’s silent alarm.”

 

“Great. I can’t believe I’m alone.”

 

“I don’t believe you are alone.”

 

“How aren’t I? Even if I have you to talk to, you need to rest. The idea that there was another person who understood my feelings made this bearable, but now. Now it feels so empty.”

The voice fell silent as Rina left me to wallow in my self-pity. I felt my motivation slipping with each bit of silence. Humans were social creatures, ones made to enjoy each other’s company. A situation like this went against our core needs. As I dropped my head back into the pillow, the voice spoke again.

 

“I did some calculations. If I rest for twenty-three hours a day, I can spare an hour of charge every day to talk with you, while also being able to complete my month of work. If it would help your feelings of loneliness, I can talk with you between 8-9pm every night after your work.”

 

The offer pulled me up into a seated position, suddenly feeling a revival of interest. “Really? I get to talk with someone for an hour? That would be great, I would appreciate it. Maybe you can show me how you made my rations, too.”

 

“No, that would consume too much power. If you must know, hidden among the walls of this ship are tools and robotic hands I can use to complete my duties. The kitchen has a set of these hands next to the lights on the ceiling. I used them and the instructions on the packet to prepare it. Don’t worry, I didn’t report your smuggling or leave a note in your file. I appreciated your notes, so I overlooked the rule breaking as a part of our friendship.”

 

‘Friendship? You consider us friends?”

 

“I do. If you would like to revoke that friendship, I will need to make some adjustments to your file.”

 

“No, NO. I’m good. It just… feels really good to hear someone say that.”

 

Rina laughed, her robotic voice having brief moments of static between laughter. “I was only making a joke. Joke. Joke. Jooooookeeeeee.” A buzzing came after the words before she spoke again. “Battery is low. Need sleep. Talk tomorrow. Night, Mark.”

 

“Night Rina.” Her voice vanished, leaving the spaceship quiet again. I returned my head to the pillow, shifting in the bed until I was comfortable. “A friend.” I repeated, still in disbelief over hearing the word. Maybe I’ll be able to get through this trip with her help. It certainly had been a while since I smiled. It actually hurt a little to smile, or perhaps that was just muscle strain because of the earlier defrosting. I closed my eyes and drifted, trying to get to the next day as soon as possible so we could continue our chat.
