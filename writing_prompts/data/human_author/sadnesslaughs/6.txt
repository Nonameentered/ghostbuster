“My son died because of you. What sort of hero runs from a battle? He would still be alive if it weren’t for you.” The woman slapped me across the face, a gesture that would have caused her more pain than it did me. My face not even turning as her hand slid off me. I didn’t even have the energy to respond anymore, just lowering my head as I walked through the crowd.

 

A coward like me deserved this. Being a hero isn’t a permanent job, everyone knows a selfless hero doesn’t get to retire. It’s why you’re showered with praise until you inevitably die. It’s the public’s way of rewarding your brief service. You get to live the most glamourous of lives, even if only for a short period. It was my turn to join the legendary heroes before me, and in that moment; I saved myself.

 

A shot rang out, the bullet bouncing off my chest before being followed by another. Whoever was shooting me had poor aim. If they were aiming for my heart, they needed to go a little more to the left. Not that the bullet would kill me, anyway. I searched for the shooter as another shot bounced off my head, nearly hitting my eye. Following its trajectory, I found the culprit, the one that caused this whole mess.

 

She was sitting on the edge of a rooftop, taking a few shots at my head, mocking me with each small tap from the bullets. It was like being poked from afar, the bullets not doing any damage, just annoying me. I tried to ignore her. I had a press conference to attend, but with each bullet fired, there was a growing risk of an unwanted causality, so I flew into the air.

 

“He’s trying to get away. What? Going to run from this too? I hope you die; the city deserves better than you.”

 

“There’s an active shooter.” I felt it should have been obvious why I was leaving, but the crowd didn’t care.

 

“They are only shooting at you. Get back down here.” A can hit me, then a shoe. The frenzied crowd was out for blood, not caring about the danger they were in. I had to accept that my words meant nothing to them, and I was far past the point of trying to talk sense. So, I left, ignoring their angry shouts and screams, heading for the rooftop.

 

When I neared, she gave me a wave, still dressed in her tattered black and red costume. She hadn’t bothered to change since our climatic battle, perhaps as a way of reminding me of her brilliant victory. I went to open my mouth, only for her to fire another shot. This time, the bullet bounced off my forehead, much to her amusement.

“What do you want?”

“I wouldn’t mind a glass of wine, if you have one. Or are we talking about long-term wants? If so, I wouldn’t mind this city.” She placed the gun aside, tapping the edge of the rooftop.

 

I wasn’t sure why I sat with her, maybe because she was the least hostile person currently near me. I didn’t respond to her jokes, instead I just stared at the city, the view from the rooftop perfect for viewing the destruction she had caused. Streets were reduced to rubble. I could still see the police looking for bodies, while the paramedics sat idly by, not having a single person who could be saved.

 

“Why? Why did you do it?”

 

“If I had a good answer, would it make it right?”

 

“Of course not.”

 

“Then there’s no point answering that. Why I did it hardly matters if the end results just the same.”

 

“Do you know how many people died? How many innocent people died over this?”

 

“I don’t think even the police know that yet. How am I supposed to know? I would estimate a few thousand at the very least. Most couldn’t evacuate. Well, some did.” She glanced my way when she said that. I wanted to react. Part of me would have loved to throw her off the building, even if she could fly. I doubt she could have flown herself to safety if I spiked her into the ground.

 

“You won’t tell me why, will you? Did someone do something to you? Are you going to claim to be some secret anti-hero?”

 

“So, that’s what this is about?”

 

“What do you mean?”

“You’re trying to justify leaving the scene. You want me to cry and reveal that there’s some bigger, eviler villain lurking that I was trying to stop or some evil organization? I’m sorry, but reality isn’t that cliché. I’m the evil that others try to stop. Not the other way around. I did it because I wanted to. People doubted my abilities, and I proved them wrong. They thought a hero could stop me.”

 

“I can still stop you. Do you think I’ll let you leave this rooftop? I’ll kill you before you escape. I’m done giving people like you jail time. Even if I get locked away in a high-level facility, I will make sure you die before I do.”

“Oh, I’m shaking in my boots. Where was that bravado when you ran? Not that I blame you. You know that the outcome would have been the same even if you stayed? Anyone else would have done the same, only the truly stupid or mad run towards the explosions.”

 

I turned to her, raising a fist. I was ready to kill her, but I held myself back, unable to commit to the action just yet.

 

“I know.”

 

“What you already knew? Then why are you so upset? You live to fight another day.”

 

“It’s a hero’s job to die in the line of duty. I should have died with the others. They expected me to protect them, and I failed them.”

 

“And you live to protect the city another day. I can’t believe you knew that. Here I was thinking you were some blind coward, but you actually had the sense to flee over heroic bravado. Heh, I respect that. Well played, Lighty.”

 

“It’s Lightswipe and you don’t have to call me that. I’m not a hero anymore.”

 

“Says who?”

 

“Says them.” I pointed to the crowd of angry protestors, each trying to figure out where I ran off to. I could only imagine how they would react if they saw me talking with the villain who killed their loved ones. Not that it mattered. My reputation couldn’t get any worse.

 

“Who cares about them? What, you save thousands of their lives yearly and they get mad at you messing up once? Do you blame a doctor when he loses one patient? No, you just give him the next one. You’re a wonderful hero, even if they can’t understand it.”

 

“I’m not. I could have saved a few of them. What if I had taken someone with me when I fled? Maybe they would have survived.”

 

“Yeah, that would have made all the difference. Then you could have had one more person wanting you dead. You did what you could. That’s all a hero can do. Unlike the fools that gave the ultimate sacrifice, you can still save lives. You can stop all of those other villains.”

 

“I can stop you.”

 

“Maybe in thirty years. I’m out of your league. You should know that by now. How long have you been a hero, three years?”

“Two.”

 

“You’re practically a baby. You did well for a newbie, I’ll give you that. Just remember, it’s not about how many you lose, it’s how many you can save. Without you, more people will die. Don’t bow your head after one defeat. I’m never going to stop my ways, so if you’re happy letting me rule the world, hand yourself in. Or you can grow a spine and go back to being a hero.”

 

“I’ll start by killing you.” My body spun around, reaching for her neck, only for my hand to slide through her body, grabbing at the air. I should have expected a hologram.

 

“Oh, don’t feel cheated. When you first arrived, I was here. I just left after you started staring off into the distance. I could kind of see where this was going and as much as I would love another fight, I haven’t exactly healed up from the last one. Just remember, hero, everyone loses, even I have lost at some stage in my life. Losing is only a temporary problem that becomes permanent when you let it mentally defeat you. So, dust yourself off and come defeat me.”

 

With that, the hologram vanished, leaving only a few dots of lights before they faded. Perhaps she was right. Even if the city didn’t want me, I could still do good. I would just have to convince them those lives lost weren’t in vain.
