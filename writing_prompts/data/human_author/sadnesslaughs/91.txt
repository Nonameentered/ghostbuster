[Part 1 of 2]

“No. you don’t understand. If I mix the tea and coffee together, I’ll get the benefits of both.” I tried to explain myself to the woman behind the counter, who only called me a freak, before handing me my order. It was hardly the first time a server had called me a freak, but it still stung. At the very least, they didn’t chase me out of the store this time, unlike the tuna and peanut butter sandwich incident.

 

I found myself a seat towards the back of the coffee shop, setting my cups down. “Ok, time to prove them all wrong.” Sure, my last experiment only resulted in crunchy peanut flavored tuna, but I was certain this one would be a success. I felt the lingering stare of the server as I reached for my cup of tea, fingers trembling as I shifted it over to my coffee cup. Holding my breath, I steadied my hand, grasping the plastic lid and twisting it off, revealing the ocean of pale liquid inside.

 

I can do this. Humans have only ever advanced by experimentation. I’m sure people like Einstein and Picasso were called freaks during some period of their life as well. To think, if all goes well, I would join their ranks as one of the greatest minds alive. I let the tea drip into the coffee cup, watching as it swirled together, mixing the calming effects of the tea with the high energy hit of caffeine, fusing the two into a perfect yin and yang of taste.

 

As I went to taste the divine beverage, I felt a rocking beneath me as the floor shifted. “Huh? Did anyone else feel that?” After a moment of tense silence, another tremor hit, shaking my table. I quickly gripped the cup, holding it as the table flipped over, falling victim to the tremors.

 

“EARTHQUAKE!” a voice shouted as everyone panicked. Some rushed out of the shop while others dived underneath tables. I stayed firmly in my seat, staring at the beverage in my hand. If I was going to die, I had to know how it tasted.

 

When the warm mixture hit my lips, I was greeted by a feeling of pure bliss, a euphoric awakening that made my body jolt up from the seat. I had advanced past the mortal strings that held humanity down; I was enlightened. “Bleh. Wish it tasted nicer.” While the taste was nothing special, the feeling it gave was something that made it worth it.

“The One must come to us. The One must come to us.” Those words echoed through the store, shattering its windows. As I shifted closer to the broken windows, I could see the towers that emerged from the ground, causing the tremors, each having a unique pulsating white glow, one of an angelic nature.

 

“I’m the one. I’m the one everybody.” My cheers received no response. It was as if everyone was frozen in place, their expressions of horror plastered on their faces. Did time stop moving? I approached the server, waving my hand in front of her face. “Hello?”

 

No response came, only a ghostly silence. With each passing second, the towers continued their monotone chant, calling for the one to come to them. With no other options, I went to find the tower, something that wasn’t hard given its impressive stature.

 

I passed two blocks before arriving in front of the tower. “I’m here. Are you going to open the tower door for me or something?” I received no response from the tower, only that same chant.

“The One must come to us.”

 

“I’m right here.” And yet no one responded. I placed my fingers against the glowing tower, only for my hand to vanish into a ray of light. Before I could scream, the light shifted up my forearm, enveloping me in its glow before I vanished.
