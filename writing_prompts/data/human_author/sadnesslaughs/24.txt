[Part 2 of 2]

“Heheh.” Brandon started laughing, only to cover his mouth when he saw Bob staring up at him. “Sorry.”

 

“Don’t apologize, laughter means you might finally be over that head knock. I’m used to the laughter. As a comic relief partner, you kind of just get used to being looked at as a joke. Doesn’t stop hurting, though.” He said before breaking into a smile. “I’m only pulling your chains. I’m over it. Especially now that I can make those stupid chosen ones cower in fear by presenting them with union demands.”

 

“Is this union like some secret club?” Brandon sat up in the chair, excited at the prospect of finally getting to join a secret club. Usually, such things were reserved for the chosen ones, but now he got to be a part of something.

 

“Not really. It’s a government organized thing that any sidekick can join. Guess the only secret thing about us is that most chosen ones don’t tell their sidekicks we exist. Hell, some even hide their sidekicks from us.”

 

“Why? Isn’t a union a good thing?”

“For normal people? Yes, for the ones making a lot of money. No.” Bob reached into his pocket, pulling out a folded-up piece of paper. After a bit of unfolding, he revealed the crumbled union contract. “So, for starters, let me get the bad part out of the way. We will take five percent of your pay. This covers our fees and helps keep us funded. On the other hand, people who are part of the union are generally paid twice as much and receive a lot of health benefits such as-“

 

“THERE YOU ARE. I CAME AS FAST AS I COULD.” Ballistic Bouncer rushed towards the two, still carrying a half empty beer. “I was so worried about you. How is your head? Do you need to go to the hospital? I told him I would be back.” Ballistic laughed only to grab Bob by the collar. “You said you worked for the government, not the union.”

 

“Eh, potato, tomato, same thing.”

 

“THAT IS NOT HOW THAT EXPRESSION GOES.” Ballistic hissed, pushing the man aside as he crouched by Brandon’s side. “B-dog, Brahman, Bralacka. How’s my favorite sidekick going? Come on, let’s get you to a hospital.”

 

“Huh? But I kind of want to hear about these benefits. Apparently, I get health benefits if I join?”

“Health benefits? Why would you need those? You’re super tough. Nothing can hurt you.”

 

“Nothing can hurt him? There’s blood dripping from his nose and that mark on his head looks a little nasty. I think he can get hurt. Now, if you want to join, I can get your paperwork submitted right away and we can cover about eighty percent of your hospital visit.”

 

“E-eighty percent? That much? That would save me so much money.”

 

“No, it wouldn’t. Unions are parasites, they just take your money and sit on their asses all day. If you just stick with me, no one touches your money, how greats that?”

 

“But hospital visits are expensive. Those already take up most of my pay.”

 

“Then maybe we need to get you another doctor. I’m sure there are ex villains that work for cheap.”

“Wow, I thought my chosen one was bad. She at least tried to offer me some fairer conditions before I went to the union. You’re the scummiest of them all. You would really send him to an ex villain rather than cover his visits? Tell him how much you make a week.”

 

“Um, I believe that employees shouldn’t share their wages amongst themselves as it increases infighting.”

 

“Right, right? And how much do you earn, Brandon?”

 

“About ten dollars an hour? So, whatever that ends up being a week.”

 

“See, there you have it. If Brandon can happily tell me how me he gets paid and you can’t, it’s pretty clear, there’s a massive gap.” Bob handed the contract to Brandon, much to the annoyance of Ballistic Bouncer.

 

“That’s not fair. I just believe in workplace confidentiality.”

 

“No, you just believe in ripping off your sidekick. Want to know why he’s so against this? It’s because we take a small portion of his pay to cover any injuries that occur to you. Now, if he puts you in harm’s way, it costs him. I bet you won’t be carelessly tossed into battle anymore.”

 

“That isn’t true. I care deeply about you, Brandon. I could have chosen any sidekick, but I chose you.” Ballistic Bouncer crouched at his side, spilling the rest of his beer onto Brandon’s lap as he tried to appear kind. “Now, why don’t we take you to the hospital? We don’t need any union; I’ll even help pay some of your fees.”
“You’re spilling beer on me.” Brandon huffed, pushing his chosen one away as he held out his hand towards Bob. “Got a pen?”

 

“Yeah, sure. You won’t regret this.” Bob got out a pen with an image of a surfboard and the words ‘Surf’s up dudes’ along its side.

 

Brandon quickly took the pen, signing the contract much to the dismay of Ballistic Bouncer.

 

“Idiot, don’t come crying to me when you can’t afford anything.” In a huff, he left as quickly as he came, returning to the bar he had come from.

 

“You made the right choice. Um, are you ok?”

 

Brandon felt his head spin from standing up too quickly, collapsing into the chest of Bob, who held him up. Having an odd amount of strength for someone that was a sidekick. “Got any money for the bus?”

 

“I’ll drive you. Just don’t touch the edges of the van unless you want to get a tetanus shot.” Bob helped Brandon into the van, taking him to the hospital, starting the beginning of his new life as a sidekick with proper work benefits.
