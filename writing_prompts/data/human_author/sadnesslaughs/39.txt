“And what type of knight am I meant to be?" David said, only to receive a glare from his master.
 

“You will be a dead one if you keep asking stupid questions like that. Obviously, you are the smart knight. Ok, so take a closer look at her wrists. Can you see how the chains on her wrists have perfectly rounded keyholes? They are too perfectly rounded. Another way to tell is by the conditioning of the metal. Most magic users will summon clean chains because adding the finer details, like rust and wear, is a complicated process. Also… Most princesses aren’t grinning like idiots during the entire demonstration.”

 

Merlin rubbed his forehead, staring at the demon, Malice, who was still happily smirking to herself, only for her to jump up when she noticed who he was talking to. “Sorry Merelie, it’s just you always find such cute knights. Well, they are cute until they die. I’ll try to be more serious. How’s this?” She gave a pout, making herself look more like a child in time out than a captured princess.

 

“UNTIL THEY DIE? YOU SAID I WAS THE FIRST!” David said, suddenly feeling a lot less confident about being the chosen hero of prophecy.

 

“First of your family. Look, there’s a lot of chosen people, not all of them can be grand heroes. Some have to be the steppingstones for others, but I’m sure you will do fine. Also, it’s Merlin, not Merelie. Can we keep some professionalism here? You said you would take this seriously if I spared you.”

 

“I’m a trickster. This is very serious for me.” Malice said, offended that he would even suggest she was enjoying any part of this.

 

“Wait? You hired a demon to help me? I’m meant to slay demons.”

 

“Oh, try to slay me then. You wouldn’t be the first. Come on, step forward, be a brave knight, not a clever one.” She said, trying to lure him into the various traps.

 

“I didn’t hire her; I requested her help in exchange for her life. It is a contract, not a work agreement.”

 

“So, you are using her like a slave?” David said, giving Merlin a look of suspicion.

“She tried to eat my soul; this is the least she can do to make it up to me. Don’t side with the demon. Now, can we take this a little more seriously? You will leave in a week. I plan to have you somewhat educated by that time.”

 
“Ugh. Can’t we just skip to the part where he stabs me? This is boring. I would prefer to be back in hell. At least there I could torment people; this is like I’m the one getting tormented. Huh, maybe tormenting people isn’t a good thing. HEY MERELIE, I learned my lesson that tormenting people is wrong. Can I go now?”

 

“What? No, of course you can’t go. This isn’t a magic school; you can’t just get dismissed. You have learnt nothing, either. As soon as I release you, you will make another attempt on my life.”

 

“Oh, come on. She’s learned her lesson. Maybe she can be freed?” David said, only for Malice to laugh at him.

 

“This is the best you could find. THIS? HE ACTUALLY FELL FOR THAT.” The illusion Malice had set faded as she rolled on the floor, laughing. Hellish flames slipped off her tongue as she found endless joy in the knight’s naivety.

 

The once decorated throne room now returned to being a common household living room. The floor of the living room was littered with bear traps and even a few magical portals that would teleport the person who stepped onto the portal into a pit.

 

“Malice, you said you would take this seriously.”

 

“Sorry Merelie. I just can’t believe he fell for the whole demons can change line. He’s even greener than I thought.”

 

David stared at his shoes before reaching for his sword. The only thing stopping David from rushing in like a brave knight was Merlin’s hand, pinning his arm to its side. “Take a break David. We will resume your training in an hour.”

 

David grumbled something about the demon before he stormed out, leaving Merlin to flick his fingers, clearing the traps with a magical gust of wind.

 

“You said you were going to be helpful. Breaking down their confidence isn’t helping them.’

 

“Isn’t it? If he realizes how weak he is, he might run away. Isn’t that better than dying to some big, evil monster? You’re the bad guy here, sending him to his death. How old is he? Twenty-two?”

 

“Twenty-one.”

 

“Twenty-one and you’re sending him to his death. How do you sleep at night?”

 

“Uncomfortably. I recite every fallen hero before I sleep. I refuse to let their memories die until I join them. Don’t think I do this willingly. If it were up to me, I would be the one fighting off evil, not them.”

 

“Why don’t you? You’re stronger than most humans, hell you’re stronger than most demons. You are the better hero.”

“I’m not the one prophesied to beat them. The church was clear that the hero would be the one of their choosing. I am merely here to guide that hero.”

 

“Huh? Who even came up with this prophecy business? It sounds like something a demon would say.”

 

“What are you implying?”

 

“Just that you may have been getting fooled by a demon this entire time. Put it this way, if I knew someone could kill me, do you think I would wait around for them? No, I would find some way to trick everyone into leaving me alone or sending me some free meals.” Malice licked her lips, turning to Merlin and crossing her arms. “Well, do you agree?”

 

“To think you may have actually proven to be useful. That makes a frightening amount of sense. Perhaps it’s time that I enter the battlefield. I’ll let David know and may god have mercy on my soul for those I led into battle because of my ignorance.”

 

“Pfft, you should demand forgiveness from god. He’s the reason we exist. I wonder if those knights you sent to their deaths ended up in…”

 

Before those words could finish, Merlin tossed Malice against the wall, a blue hand clutching her, threatening to push her through the wood. She attempted to break his spell, only for his grip to tighten. The feeling of the hand closing continued before he broke the spell, allowing her to catch her breath.

 

“Trickster, you know I am a patient man, but even patient men have their limits. If you plan to keep agitating me, I can return you to hell.”

 

Malice clutched the floor, gasping for air. Thanks to her demonic blood, it took only a few moments to recover from the damage, quickly rising back to her feet. “And miss this? I’m curious now. Everyone keeps talking about this monster or beast and yet I haven’t even seen them. I want to know what they look like. Plus, I want to make sure your soul doesn’t escape me. Demons don’t take defeat well. Are you certain you don’t want to kill me?”

 

“You aren’t worth killing. Do as you please. Just know that if you try to harm us, I will get rid of you.”

 

“Oh, I won’t interfere with your little journey, promise.”

 

Merlin left his home, meeting David outside, informing the knight of the news. David seemed a little comforted by the fact he would have help, only to realize that the demon was tagging along. Malice floated behind Merlin like a ominous reaper, looming over his every step, not wanting to let him out of her sight.

 

“Does she have to come? Can’t you send her back to hell?”

 

“I could, but she could prove useful. If we are dealing with demons, it’s good to have an expert.” 

“And what makes you think I’ll tell you anything, Merelie?”

 

“I just have a feeling you might. Enough talking. Pack your bags, David, and meet me by the gate tomorrow. We can continue your lessons on the road.” David headed back into town to inform his parents of the news while Merlin went back inside, collecting his artifacts and preparing for an early night’s sleep.
