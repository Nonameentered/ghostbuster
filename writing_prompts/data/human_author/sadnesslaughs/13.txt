[Part 2 of 2]

“Hm? I guess I’m like anyone that stays here for a long period. I was running from my problems.”

 

“What problems did you have? Money problems?”

 

“Personal problems that I don’t intend to share with you. I was drinking heavily and then on one of my drunken nights, I stumbled into this place. It was empty, just a room in the world's void, untouched by anything. Yet, it had a fully stocked bar and kitchen. As if someone had left it here. So, I did what came naturally. I started drinking and drinking until I could drink no more. When I woke up, another man had stumbled in, so I just served him a drink. After all, it wasn’t my booze, and I was happy to sell it. That was a thousand years ago. I guess I just kept serving people that came here and eventually it became my job.”

 

“Incredible. Did you say a thousand years? Wouldn’t that make you immortal? Or some type of deity. Not even aliens live that long.” Suddenly, Eric had his camera out again. This time, the lens was flashing a green beam, one that was scanning over Mack, making sure he had a holographic image of him.
 
“No, I’m just some guy. I have no idea why I’m not dead. Maybe it’s because I’m the only bartender this place has got. It’s obviously magical, in a way.” Mack said, trying to shield the green beam from his face. Soon the beam stopped, and Mack placed the drink down.

 

“Then what about the furniture? The pool table and the dartboard. How did you get them?”

 

“Aliens and timehoppers. Those are the only two customers that ever come back. Sometimes I get them to bring me supplies, but even then, it’s rare I get what I want. I have a whole spare room full of junk that I can’t use. Can’t even give the stuff away. Do you want a singing wall fish? For some reasons the aliens think that’s what I mean by entertainment. I have about ten of them. From eels to bass. I did used to put the bass up but after hearing drop the bass jokes for a century, I tossed it in the spare room. If the pub gets really noisy, you can sometimes hear their singing.”

 

Eric couldn’t help but laugh. It was rather sad the state the place was in, but the way Mack told the story made it impossible for him not to chuckle. When he noticed Mack glaring his way, Eric quickly took a sip of his drink, occasionally causing the drink to bubble as he tried not to laugh while sipping it.

 

“That’s an incredible story. So, I assume you have met some interesting people, right?”

 

‘Yeah, I used to take photos with them all, but it got too complicated. Especially since I have to take their word for it that their famous. Once the timehoppers arrived, I stopped taking photos. Suddenly every hopper that came here was a King or Queen. Ugh, you hoppers really ruin everything.”

“I would love to see some photos if you have them. Maybe I can identify the people in them? Let you know whose really famous and who isn’t?”

 

“I think I would rather not know. At the end of the day, they are just another customer. Sure, the first time you see a celebrity or no alien, it’s impressive. But after a while, everyone is just the same.”

 

“Except you. You’re different. You have outlived everyone and were chosen by the pub.”

 

“I don’t know if I would say I was chosen.”

 

“It must have been fate. I don’t need a celebrity to interview, I can just interview you. The man that time couldn’t catch. Isn’t that an amazing headline?” 

“Yeah, great… Look, I’m not interested in an interview. I have other customers to serve. You’re just lucky you came at a quiet period or I would have stopped talking to you ages ago.”

 

“Don’t be like that. It will be great for you. Once people hear your story, I’m sure hoppers will happily come and work for you. You could start your kitchen, have proper food. You might even improve this place.”

 

“It would be nice to eat proper food. A man can only eat so many mystery meat sandwiches before he wonders if even a place lost to time can protect him from the damage it’s doing to his stomach. Ok, one quick interview. Just make me look really pitiful. That should get me more help.”

 

Eric only gave a nod, confident he didn’t need to do anything to make him look more pitiful. He took a few photos of him behind the bar, his once clean buttoned up white shirt now missing buttons, leaving his hairy stomach sticking out. His dark hair greasy with heavy bags sitting under his brown eyes. He was the definition of sad and that was exactly what Eric needed to get interest in his article. When the photos were taken, he took out a small blue sphere, pressing his thumb against the top of it.

 

“Ok, I’ll use this to record the audio and my camera can take care of the video. Now, let’s start.”

Mack answered his questions, giving as little information as he could into his personal life, while happily explaining the history behind his drinks and pub design. After a few minutes of talking, another customer came up to the counter and Mack cut the interview short, going over to serve the customer, while Eric placed his camera away.

 

“Great, that should be enough. Help and supplies should come soon. I’ll send them as soon as I get back.”

 

“Right, thanks.”

 

Mack watched as Eric adjusted the face of his watch, spinning the metallic top until it was set to his time period. He pressed down on the face and vanished into a ball of light, leaving only a burn mark on the wooden floor.

 

“How hard is it to use the designated hopping area?” Mack grumbled, pointing to a small stone floored area in the bar’s corner that had a sign hanging above it with the words ‘Hoppers Hopping point.’ Of course, that area didn’t have many burn marks, since hoppers weren’t usually the types to follow basic instructions. Still, he didn’t mind that hopper. For all his faults, he seemed a decent enough kid. He just hoped those supplies would arrive soon.
