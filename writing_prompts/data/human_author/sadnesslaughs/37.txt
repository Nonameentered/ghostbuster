[Part 1 of 2]

“Oh, fine establishment. Good scent and human seems mostly clean. Oh, fine establishment.” The alien said, the eight-foot creature crouching under my garage door as it entered my workshop. Just the sound of its roaring voice was enough to make me jump, causing me to bang my head on the car’s opened hood.

 

“Fuck, ow. How did you even get under that?”

 

“I crouched, I crouched.” It repeated, making waving motions with its arms as another alien squatted before shuffling under the door like an excited crab.

 

“Um, is there something wrong with your translator? You seem to have a bit of echo, buddy. Want me to have a look at it?” I went to find a screwdriver, trying to be helpful, even if I knew all I would do was glance it over and then recommend they go see an alien embassy about it. What was I meant to do? I repaired cars; our technology is primitive compared to theirs.

 

“This is how we talk; we wish to sample the delicacies of this fine establishment. This is how we talk.” It said happily as the other alien returned to an upright position. They both had circular mouths filled with what looked to be rows of tiny teeth. It was hard to see from a distance, and I certainly wasn’t asking for a closer look.

 

“Ok, you don’t need to repeat the first words. I get the message. Anyway, I’m sorry to say but I don’t sell food, I repair human cars. There’s a nice little place down the road that does good kebabs, though. If you fancy something like that.” I tried to be nice, a little out of respect and a lot out of fear. I often saw aliens from a distance when I was doing my shopping or sometimes at my local kebab shop, but never up-close like this.

 

“Human cars? Fascinating. I’m Hexi and this is my bondmate, Lavpi. Human cars?” The other alien, Hexi, gave some introductions as she moved to my side. Shortly after, Lavpi did the same, leaving me stuck between two tall aliens.

 

“What Hullithium gauge does this run on? What hul-“ Lavpi attempted to stop his repetition, politely covering his mouth. His large hand being big enough that it covered his face as well.

 

“A hull? What like the things that boats have? No, this is a car. It runs on…” I didn’t bother finishing that. The two aliens stared at me like doting grandparents, neither interested in what I was saying. Only listening because they found my attempts at explaining it cute.

 

“I’m sure you are doing amazing work for your kind.” Hexi too made the same effort at avoiding repetition, the aliens showing a rare understanding that most humans wouldn’t have bothered giving me.
After my explanation, a loud click went off before I was blinded. I let out a horrible scream as I flailed my arms, assuming I was being kidnapped. When my sight returned, two concerned faces greeted me as Hexi put away her cheap flash camera. Her yellow eyes staring at me as she gave my cheek a poke.

 

“I’m sorry, earthling, I was told this device was safe to use. I’m sorry.” The repetition slipped back as she grew worried. I blinked out the last pieces of blinding light from my eyes before giving a reassuring smile.

 

“It’s fine. It’s safe, I just didn’t expect it, that’s all. Ouch. Um, you two seem nice and you're welcome to look around my shop, but I don’t think I can really help you with the food situation.”

 

“Are you certain? We wanted to try some authentic human cooking. So many of your restaurants now try to cater to us. We want to taste the flavors of Earth.” Lavpi said, before opening a flap of skin on his stomach, revealing a set of weird unknown black organs. He fished around in his body before retrieving a wet two hundred dollars. “Is this enough?”

 

I stared at the money, tempted to just take it. It wasn’t like I was that in a good enough position to refuse money coated in slick alien stomach juices. That money could help me pay my next set of bills. Still, I held my hand up, refusing. Mechanics had a bad enough reputation as it is. I didn’t want those nasty rumors to spread throughout the galaxy, too.

 

“Sorry, I really can’t take that money. It wouldn’t be right. I don’t know how to cook at all. The best authentic human dish I could make you is something I grew up with called a vegemite sandwich.” I said with a small laugh.

 

The two aliens gave each other a look before their mouths widened in what I could only assume was a smile? Either that or they were getting ready to latch onto my face and suck my skin off.

 

“A vegemite sandwich? That sounds delightful. A vegemite sandwich?” Again, the excitement caused a verbal slip up as Hexi pushed Lavpi’s hand, trying to get the alien to hand me the money at a quicker rate.

 

“It does. But are you certain you don’t want the money?” Lavpi clearly felt a little bad, slowly opening his stomach flap once more, giving me plenty of time to request the money.

 

“I really can’t take the money. Um, look I’ll see if I have the ingredients, ok? If I do, I’ll make you one.”

“Thank you, human, we appreciate it. May we know the name of the human that will feed us?” Hexi asked.
