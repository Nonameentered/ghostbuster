[Part 1 of 2]

“I insist. These muffins I made are to die for. Please try one.” Melchior held the tray of raspberry muffins. The soft cakey outside of the muffin, dripping with red raspberry juices, giving it a deep streaky stain along the sides.

 

“No, no. You’re my guest. I wouldn’t want to fill up on your food. Us fairies can’t eat that much food, anyway.” Azia said as she floated through the kitchen. The fairy vanishing in quick flashes of movement as she buzzed throughout the room.

 

“How about a nibble, then? Just a small crumb?”

 

“As lovely as it looks, I have to decline. If I’m being honest, I didn’t expect you to bring something to our little afternoon tea.”

 

“Well, I am a delightful guest. What sort of guest would barge into a person’s home without offering them something?”

 

“The ideal guest.” Azia thought out loud. If only he had rudely stormed in like she expected, then she could have taken control over him. Azia wondered if the vampire had already caught onto her plan. Had he heard the rumors about fairy’s tea parties? If so, she would have to be careful.

 

“May I take a seat?” Melchior gripped the edge of his chair, not yet pulling it from the table as the two silently engaged in a tactical game of manners.

 

“Oh, allow me.” The fairy flew over, gripping the chair only to let out a loud grunt. Her little wings fluttered as hard as possible and still she couldn’t make the chair budge an inch.

 

Azia continued to struggle, doing her best to hide the sly grin that was sneaking onto her lips. This would be so easy. Azia knew humans better than anyone, and vampires were just super old humans. He would snatch the chair from her soon, breaking the rule of being a good guest. Sure, maybe helping her pull the chair out would be considered a good move, but if she didn’t ask for the help, it would be rather rude to just interrupt her attempts.

“Have you tried using magic? I know you have spells that can move objects. Your lovely kitchen is designed for humans, so you must be able to move the objects inside.”

 

“Huh? Oh, silly me, I must have just forgotten I have magic. How silly of me. How… Silly… Of…. Me…”

 

Melchior could hear the grinding of the small fairy’s teeth. It didn’t take much to fluster a fairy, and just the simple act of pointing something out had already caused her blood to boil. She gave the air a small stomp with her foot before she wiggled a finger, sliding the chair out for the vampire.

 

“Thank you. Don’t worry, everyone makes mistakes. I wouldn’t even consider it a mistake, more a lack of judgement.” Melchior loved the glare he received for that comment. She wouldn’t be able to resist kicking him out. How silly did she think he was? Like a creature with a brain the size of his fingernail would outsmart him.

 

“I’ll show you a….”

 

“Yes? Were you about to say something?”

 

“Just that I’ll show you a cake that will make you say. Wow, I can’t believe this isn’t real blood!”

 

Azia flew around the kitchen, moving the trays and teacups to the table. Sure, the vampire got lucky, but he had to survive a whole tea party. That meant his manners had to be consistent for the entire party. One mistake and he would be doomed to her servitude. Finally, she would have a minion. Or a friend…

 

Soon the table was stacked with a wide assortment of sandwiches, cakes and even a floral smelling tea. The tea sitting in a flowery pink teapot with cute little fairy sized tea cups beside it. Azia knew he would complain about the fairy sized tea cups. He wouldn’t be able to help himself. While she set the table, Melchior pulled out a small blue napkin with the initials M.K. on it, tucking it down the front of his shirt.

 

“I would hate to make a mess. That would be something only a terrible guest would do.” Melchior smirked, watching as the fairy froze up.
