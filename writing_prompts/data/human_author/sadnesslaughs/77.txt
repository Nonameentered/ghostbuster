“Ok, I’m certain we only had two arms. Don’t you remember having two arms?” Melissa joined Dave on the couch. Staring at the man who was using his new third arm as a cupholder for his drink, finding the new limb helpful.

 

“Oh, come on Melissa. We always had three arms; don’t you remember? We used to play three handed catch all the time. Plus, think of all those jugglers. How could someone juggle with two arms? Such a thing would be impossible. You must have just had a strange dream.”  

 

“Maybe you’re right. Something just feels weird about it. The last month has been strange too. Like, didn’t we only have one moon before?” Melissa couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. Could this just be one strange coincidence, like the news reports said?

 

“NASA discovers new moons all the time. It’s not that big of a deal. Maybe they just hadn’t looked in that spot before.”

 

“But we can see the moon from Earth. Shouldn’t someone have noticed the second moon?” Melissa knew she had made a good point when Dave paused to consider it. His third arm moving the drink to his lips, sipping the beverage as he pondered it.

 

“Maybe we just always thought we were staring at the same moon? How could a person tell the difference, anyway? They look pretty similar.” Dave gave her a shrug before he turned on the tv, trying to drown out his roommate.

 

“It just doesn’t feel right. Maybe I am just imagining things, though.” Melissa waved her third hand before her face, watching as it twisted and moved in front of her. It felt normal. Maybe it was just her imagination.

Dave only gave her a small “Mmm” as a response. Not wishing to allow her a chance to start the conversation again. He didn’t have time for conspiracy theories. Not when the news was on. The two silently watched the news, listening to the usual headlines about the local events before one headline came up that caught them both by surprise.

 

“Gravity not as strong as we initially thought? Today scientists at Westthix university discovered that Earth’s gravity might be like that of the moon. This has caused a stir in the high jump community, with the current record holder now being a man called Bill, who was doing janitorial work at the tournament. We will have our exclusive interview with Bill at five. Please, stick around.”

 

Dave stood up, feeling a little lighter on his feet as he bounced around the room. “Heh, it’s amazing what these smart university students can discover. Who would have guessed?” His beer spilled as he bounced around the room, much to the horror of Melissa.

 

“See, this is what I mean. Something is seriously wrong here. I’m positive gravity doesn’t work this way. How could the gravity change?” Melissa gripped the couch, trying to keep her feet firmly planted on the floor, feeling them bounce a little with her slight movements.

 

“It didn’t. This is how gravity has always been.” Dave made the best of the new situation before pulling himself back onto the couch, looking at Melissa. “You worry a lot. Everything is normal, the way it’s always been.”

 

“Guess you’re right. I remember always feeling pretty light on my feet.” She admitted, scratching her head. She felt a small tinge of pain linger in her head before it faded, leaving her with a feeling that everything was fine.

“FUCK, FUCK, FUCK, FUCK. WHY IS THE GRAVITY GLITCHING NOW?” Blisk frantically tapped away at the keypad before him. “I need to apply a patch before the humans notice. Why is the Earth simulation freaking out?”

 

“There isn’t enough time. The humans have already noticed, just change their minds so they think it’s normal. We will have to work with this.” Lopi kicked the simulation machine, causing more sparks to fly from its monitor. “Stupid machine.”

 

“No, don’t do that. GREAT, now the humans have four eyes. Are you proud of yourself, Lopi?” Blisk let out a sigh as he rested his head on the keypad, exhausted. “Maybe we should just try to load an old save. They won’t notice if we do, right?”

 

“Last time we did that, we nearly wiped their minds. Maybe we should just shut down the simulation and free the humans? How long can we hold a grudge for Roswell? It’s not like we weren’t probing their kind. We had to expect that they would do the same to us when they found us. We could bring about a new age of peace when we free them.”

 

“We held a grudge for four thousand years. Do you think the humans won’t do the same for this?” Blisk looked up at Lopi, who only sighed, shaking his head. Lopi could not fault Blisk’s logic. What would humans do to them?

“Ok, keep the simulation going. Let’s just hope these humans are as dumb as we think they are. It will be hard to explain the simulation to them if they figure it out on their own.” Lopi said, as the two aliens frantically worked to keep the simulation running.
