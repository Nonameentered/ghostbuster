Humans were lucky. Death often came quick for them. How many centuries have I been dying for? I lost count after the first few. My sight failed me two centuries ago, with my other senses slowly following. I fear I don’t even have a body anymore. If I do, I can no longer feel it.

 

Is there a heaven or a hell? Maybe, but I fear those luxuries are reserved for the suffering mortals. I will fade into nothingness, a remnant of a violent past that the humans wish to overlook. If I had been kinder to them, perhaps things might have been different.

 

I remember blaming the humans in the past for my decline. Angry that they would dare to forget me. How could they forget the man that walked through their villages spreading disease? Fear was my method of being remembered. I had seen the good gods fall into obscurity, their kind gestures often praised until the humans discovered a new deity. Humans were too finicky to be gifted with love.

 

Fear, fear, was the only way to be remembered. People didn’t pray to me out of love, they prayed out of necessity. I was that silent killer that waited in the shadows, ready to strike down whatever I wished. That was why they gave me the power of their prayers. They hoped the offering of praise would spare them, but I didn’t play favorites. Everyone is worthy of death, or at least that was what I believed.

 

For a while, my strategy worked. I lived a life of wine and song, watching the mortals fall to their knees, praying for my onslaught to stop. I watched the other kind gods fall, unable to keep their grip on the world while I prospered. Things were going well until the humans fought back.

 

It was subtle at first. Human medicine wasn’t something I was unfamiliar with. In the past, millions tried to prevent the spread of my death, but none had the knowledge to keep me at bay forever. They would build immunities or create concoctions to survive my wrath and in return, I would evolve my disease, watching with superiority as they fell.

 

Then, with each hundred years, their medicine developed far more rapidly than I could maintain. With each strike I dealt, they would recover faster than I could adapt. With each adaption, my hold on them loosened. They no longer feared me, instead they turned to more modern gods, leaving me to rot like the gods before me.

I should be angry at them, but I find it hard to hold a grudge. The humans proved I was wrong. They killed an evil god and forced him to suffer for his sins. I admired that about them. Even if my death was imminent, I could say for the first time in my life that I was proud of humanity. They made me obsolete.

 

“Well done, humans. I hope you can beat the other fools like me.” The words startled me. Was that me? It couldn’t be me. “Hello?”

 

I called out to the void, only to hear nothing but the sound of my voice. “I can hear?”

 

The realization came as a shock, peeling my eyes open, only to get greeted by a blinding flash of light. My mind assaulted by the sudden stimuli. When my vision cleared, I stared at the space surrounding me. The once colorful room I had stayed in was now a mess of broken furniture and decaying walls.

 

“Why am I alive? Are the humans truly singing my praises? Impossible, they would never bring back someone as vile as I.” I clapped my fingers together, summoning a small purple portal, peering through it into the world of humanity.

 

To have power again, it felt incredible. Searching through the portal, I came across one human, singing my praises. She was an older woman with greying hair, her hand holding that of a young man. Her tear-stained face pressed against the side of the bed as she shook with emotion.

 

“Thank god for Almona. Thank god.” Her praises, while indirect, still powered me. Why was she singing my name, though? I didn’t hurt that man, and even if I did. She didn’t seem the type that would be happy about it.

 

I slipped through the portal, taking on an ethereal body. I walked around the room, resting a chilly hand on the man’s neck.

 

“Still alive.”

The machinery they hooked him up to was odd. Humanity truly had advanced. I followed the tubes connected to his body, but still couldn’t find how I related to this. The only relation I had to this situation was the disease that ailed him. He had cancer, something that in my time alone, I came to regret bringing to humanity.

I opened my portal once more, trying a new location. This one far livelier. In a chair sat a man with a neat attire, comprising a black buttoned up shirt and a pair of matching dark pants. He had a wide grin, leaning towards the woman that sat across from him. While the two talked, the other humans pointed strange devices at them, following each of their movements.

 

“Almona is a game changer. It not only can target the cancer cells, but we have shown it to even be affective in those who are in the late stages of the disease.” The neatly dressed man stated, pointing to a picture hovering on a wall behind them. It depicted a microscopic machine, one that, according to the man, could overpower my disease.

 

“Amazing. The research you have done is groundbreaking. People are saying this is one of the biggest developments for humanity in the last century. What do you have to say to that?”

 

“Honestly? I couldn’t have gotten this far without the tireless work of those that came before me. Without them, we would never have gotten this far. Those who fought against Almona all those years ago deserve the real praise.” He gave a grin, one that felt directed at me. I could only smile back. They had fought valiantly, and I was proud of them. I would be gracious in my defeat.

“About that name. Why Almona? I know it has a connection to an old god of disease, but why would you choose something like that for the name?”

 

“When my brother told me the story of Almona, it entranced me. We have this god that tormented humanity for thousands of years and now he’s gone. I felt something about that was poetic. It’s like how we defeat diseases every year. How we rise to fight back against disease until it’s gone. Our struggle to get rid of disease is like that of our ancestors trying to get rid of Almona. Something about that just felt beautiful.”

 

The two continued to talk after that, but I didn’t listen; I was too entranced by those words. It is beautiful. I’m glad I could see this. I truly am. Humanity didn’t need to worry about my interference, they were safe from my wrath. Almona won’t be a name that causes fear, it will be one that represents health. I’ll help advance humanity.

 

I’m sure someone else will take my place soon enough. Disease is a natural thing, but my run is over. I will only aid humanity, even if that means I may be forgotten.
