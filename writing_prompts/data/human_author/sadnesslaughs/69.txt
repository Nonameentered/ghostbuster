“The killer’s name is TwerkingGoku? That must be a fake name, right? Why would the news even report something as stupid as that? Wouldn’t it have been easier to wait until his name real name came out?” It was a typical news day. Stories about corrupt politicians, dogs on surfboards and the odd murder mystery sprinkled in to make a rather mixed tone sandwich.  

 

As they went over the details of the gory murder, a name popped up that I hadn’t heard in years. Eric Mani. Eric Mani got murdered by a guy calling himself TwerkingGoku? Served that bully right. He got what he deserved for tormenting my childhood all those years ago.

 

I hadn’t honestly thought about the bully for a while, having forgotten about him after leaving Healdsburg and moving on with my life. While he just muddled around his hometown, trying to impress people with the same old jokes that had become even less funny with age. Like most class clowns, he had committed the cardinal sin of not updating his material, leaving him with nothing but the stale remnants of what might have once been a joke.

 

That momentary joy I heard when the name was announced eventually subsided. Did I even hate the guy anymore? Sure, his tormenting of me in school pushed me into some dark places, but I had moved on with my life. I left school and studied hard while he struggled. I thought I became the bigger man out of this. What bigger man is happy about someone’s death? Maybe it was natural. After all, I had posted about wanting to kill the bully myself back in my younger days. Maybe this was just those repressed feelings emerging.

 

The forum? Right, I remember that. It was an old board called Revenge forums or something? A place where edgy teens could write about how much they hated certain people. It was more a virtual diary, a place to vent to strangers who had no genuine care about your life. What was my username again? That’s right, TwerkingGoku. I was going through my Dragon Ball Z stage then.

 

It took awhile for the dots to connect, until it clicked, my eyes glued to the tv, re-reading the name at the bottom of the banner. TwerkingGoku? A person called TwerkingGoku killed Eric Mani? That’s impossible. Why would someone take my username and kill the man? Did someone else have a grudge against him? Am I being framed? The possibilities circled through my head as I blankly stared at the news report.

 

Despite my frozen state, the news report kept ticking over in the background, announcing that they would show the face and body of the suspected killer. When I heard that, I bounced from my couch, crawling closer to the screen.

A warning came up, announcing that viewers may find the picture distressing, before displaying a photo of a man wandering away from Eric Mina’s home. The man caught by his door’s security camera. The man was half blurred, his chest and legs kept hidden to avoid showing the blood on public tv, with only his face being allowed.

 

The face mirrored mine. Even with the low resolution, it was mine. The same stubble and the same crooked nose that had been shifted because of the bully’s beatings. There was no way that anyone would believe I was innocent.

 

“If anyone has any details about the man, please call the number listed on the screen. The police took the name TwerkingGoku from a card found at the crime scene. He didn’t have any money or address, only a card with that name on it. Police are looking into the possibility that the name may be linked to a gang.”

 

With that, the news report ended and a repeat of some 80s family tv show started. I sat in silence, trying to figure out what to do. I couldn’t just turn myself in. The police would blame me for the murders. I could try finding this imposter, but where would I even start looking?

 

Right, the forum. I searched for the forum on my phone and eventually landed on that ominous black and red homepage. The homepage having the text. ‘Vent out your frustrations and someone might hear.’ I went to log in, only to consider if that was a good idea. They were already searching for the user. What if they saw me log in? The police would be here in minutes.

 

What choice did I have? They would find me regardless; this might at least offer some answers. Logging into the forum, the old messages I shared between users greeted me. Most were just us complaining about the people in our lives, but one stood out. It was recent, from about a month ago.

 

TwerkingGoku, 1.9.2010: You can really make people die? :3 Help me with a bully. His name is Eric Mina.

Underworld Secrets, 6.6.2020: Yes, sorry I took so long to get back to you. Awfully busy fulfilling the other requests. Don’t worry, I’m sure he will meet his fate soon. Just be prepared for the consequences.

 

 

A reply after ten years? I didn’t think anyone even used the website anymore. I went to click on the profile only for the message to vanish from my replies, leaving me with only my old messages.

 

“Where did it go? Did I accidentally delete it?” Frantically I looked through my old messages, even checking my trash pile, only to find nothing but space. It’s gone. My only evidence is gone. Outside, I could hear police cars, each one pulling into my street. They had found me, and the only evidence of my innocence was gone. I laid on the floor, placing my hands above my head, waiting for them to kick down the door.
