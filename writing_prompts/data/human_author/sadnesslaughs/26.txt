“Ok look, I know we have all said some hurtful things to each other during this meeting, but we just need to remember that our hate shouldn’t be directed at our fellow villains but instead at the heroes that keep tricking us. Now, are we ready to continue this meeting like adults?” Skull-licker said, the skull masked man tapping the wooden desk in front of him as the villains mumbled amongst themselves, still throwing the odd glare at each other.

 

“Tricking you, maybe. Leave me out of this pity party. If you lot can’t handle your superheroes, then maybe you should all just quit and let me take over. I hear Frosty Leopard is hiring if you need a job. Don’t worry, I’ll give you all a good reference.” Shaker said, the villainess grinning as she leaned back in her chair, always happy to have all the eyes on her at these meetings.

 

“Oh yes, tell us again how many grand exploits you have done in the last month. Last I heard the earthquake causing, Shaker was left shaken by a band of rookies. I heard you were even going to squeal when they threatened you with jail time. You’re lucky to even be seated here.” Bound Cannon knocked the grin off Shaker’s face as she returned to an upright position in her chair, her hands gripping the table as the room shook.

 

“EASY, EASY. What did I just say? We handle this like adults. None of us has done anything remotely evil in the last month, and that is because of those blasted heroes. They keep changing their outfits to trick us. Did you know last week I fought Captain Fever while he was wearing his sidekick’s clothing? That’s weird, isn’t it?”

 

“Like he was wearing an outfit that looked like his sidekick’s clothing?” Shaker asked, stopping her tremors as the tension in the room slowly drifted away, now replaced with confusion.

 

“No, like he just wore his sidekicks’ clothes. Do you know how disturbing that is? It was about five sizes too small; I shouldn’t have to see that while I’m fighting him. What he did to my eyes during that fight is more villainous than anything I could ever come up with.”

 

“So, you expected to fight a sidekick only to get blindsided by a hero in tight clothing? Interesting.” A quiet voice in the back of the room spoke up, his voice followed by the shuffling of papers.

 

“Oh, Mr. Fisher, I forgot you were even here.” Skull-licker and the others turned to face the older gentlemen. The man’s fingers shaking as he placed the papers down, staring at the group from behind his thick squared glasses.

  
“Why is he even here? I thought he was retired. Are we keeping him around as some sort of good luck charm?” Bound Cannon laughed, only to feel a large weight press against his back, pinning his cheek against the table he was seated at.

 

“I don’t appreciate it when you younglings get mouthy. It’s fine when you keep it between yourselves, but you should remember it’s an honor that I even serve on this sad excuse of a villainy board. You lot couldn’t hold a candle to us, which is why I’m still here to clean up your messes. I should be in Cuba with the rest of the old board, but unfortunately, I drew the short straw.” Mr. Fisher released his ability, allowing Bound Cannon to sit back up.

 

“I’m sorry for their lack of manners. I…. We have been trying to reform the board to its full potential, but in our defense, you didn’t leave us with a lot of tools. When I came to take over, I found the building burnt to the ground.” Skull-licker argued, only to flinch when Mr. Fisher raised a hand. Thankfully, the older gentlemen was only adjusting his tie before he spoke.

 

“It was necessary that we got rid of any evidence of our crimes before leaving. We wanted to make sure nobody would ruin our retirements with a warrant for our arrests. Not that we should have had to leave you with supplies. No one gave us a building to use when we formed the board. You at least got access to our funds.”

 

“Ugh. I appreciate you are a talented villain, Mr. Fisher, but none of that helps us right now. If I wanted to listen to an old person tell me how much harder their life was than mine, I would go visit my parents. What’s next? Going to tell me you had to walk five hundred miles to get to school?” Shaker felt the pressure hit her back, but unlike Bound Cannon, she was prepared for it. Her hands gripping the table’s edge, keeping herself upright, pushing back against the force until finally she lost her grip, slamming through the table, sending small pieces of wood across the room.

 

“you lasted ten seconds. A decent attempt. No, next I was planning on telling you how to fix your little problem. Though, If I am truly that unappreciated, I will take my ideas elsewhere.”

 

“You have an idea? WHY DIDN’T YOU SAY SO?” Shaker hissed, dusting herself off as she rose from the ground, staggering back towards her seat.

 

“No one asked.”
The room was silent as everyone waited for Mr. Fisher to explain his plan. Soon a minute passed and still the room was silent until finally Skull-licker spoke. “Um, mind telling us the plan?”

 

“Sure. We send a letter to the heroes board telling them it’s unfair.”

 

“That’s it?” Skull-licker waited for something more, but nothing came.

 

“Should we also send them a fruit basket, too? Maybe film us all holding hands while singing ‘We are the world.’ Think that will fix our problem, too?” As soon as the last word left Shaker’s lips, she fell through her chair, snapping it as that familiar pressure pushed down on her.

 

“You talk a lot for someone who could be replaced by a few tectonic plates. Heroes are all about fairness in battle. Which is why we should exploit their heroic natures for our own benefit.”

 

“I mean, it could work. You could have gotten badly hurt by Captain Fever. Imagine if you were expecting a sidekick powered punch only to get a party punch from him?” Bound Cannon said, spurring on the conversation.

 

“Exactly, and what if Shaker made too strong of an earthquake thinking that the heroes she was fighting could handle the damage she caused? She could level a city if people with the wrong powers were there to stop her. It would cause billions in damages and thousands of lost lives.” Skull-licker added.

 

“Heh, that would be amazing. Imagine how funny that would be.” Shaker laughed, once again dusting herself off as she leant against the wall, not having anywhere she could sit.

 

“Now you’re all thinking like villains. We submit this letter to them and get them to stop this little nuisance of a plan they have going. Then when they send us a response stating they won’t use this trick, we rush out and commit as much villainy as possible while they are still trying to find their old suits. Now, if everyone agrees, I’ll send the letter. I expect you all to be in your costumes and ready with a plan as soon as we get our response. Don’t waste this opportunity.”

 

“We won’t sir.” Skull-licker gave Mr. Fisher a salute, watching the old man shuffle out of the room with his paperwork. “Well, let’s get ready to cause some trouble.” With that, the three villains headed to their rooms, preparing for their first fair piece of villainy in a long time.
