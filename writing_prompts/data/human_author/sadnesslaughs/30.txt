“You’re going to give him sanctuary? You don’t even know the boy. What if he’s an assassin or worse, some common flea infested peasant? This is the grand library, a holy sight. Have you all forgotten that?” Argus said, the guard red in the face, his stout body puffing as he caught his breath.

 

“Are you planning to lecture a librarian on the holy site they live in? If so, I will seriously consider your words if you can answer three questions. When was the grand library built, who was the first head librarian, and lastly, what is the purpose of the grand library?” Kayla, the head librarian, crossed her arms, waiting for the guard’s answer.

 

She watched as he fumbled over his words, trying to buy as much time as possible. His eyes darted around the room, Argus looking for anything that might give him an answer. After a decent length of time had passed, Kayla went to speak, only for a quiet voice to speak out from behind her.

 

“1260. The first librarian was Lady Bellevere, and the purpose is to contain any books that may bring about the revival of magic.” The boy answered. Each librarian silently exchanged glances before turning to him.

 

“Pfft. Magic, what a little idiot. I take it back. He can’t be an assassin. He’s too stupid. Let me take this child back to the streets he crawled in from.” Argus gripped the boy’s collar only to receive a firm slap across the cheek from Kayla.

 

“Sanctuary was granted. If you wish to proceed with your actions, I will have no choice but to report you to the king.”

 

Argus held his cheek before stepping forward. The guard easily standing over her. His chest puffed out in a mix of hurt pride and rage. He raised a gauntlet, lining it up with her face. Kayla didn’t flinch, the head librarian holding her ground until Argus dropped his hand, turning away in a huff.

 

“Don’t blame me when he causes trouble. I’ll pretend I didn’t hear about it.” Argus said, returning to his guard spot outside of the library’s doors. When he left, the other librarians rushed to her side.

 

“How dare he raise a hand towards you? We should have him tossed out of the guards immediately. I’ll report him right away.” Peter said, the fellow librarian turning to the door, only to get a tap on the back from Kayla. 

“It is fine, Brother Peter. We don’t need any complications with the guards. If we report one, the others might cause us trouble.”

 

“So, we just let them treat you like this? What if he had hit you?”

 

“Then he would have hit me. A hit isn’t worth putting the library at risk. I will happily take any pain needed to guard this place, just like any of you would. The library is more important than any of us. Speaking of the library, how did you know all of that? Especially the part about the magic? That isn’t something we tell the public.”

 

Everyone turned to the boy. He wasn’t anything remarkable, looking like any other beggar one might see on the street. His long brown hair was coated with dried dirt while his clothing had various breaks and holes in the fabric. He gave a polite bow when everyone looked his way.

 

“Dad told me about it. Said his grandmother never had time for him and his siblings because she was too busy protecting a whole lot of nothing. I read one of the books grandma left. It was interesting. Do you have more books like that?”

 

“Grandma? What was your grandmother’s name? Perhaps she still works here?” Tricia said, already reaching for their record book, eager to figure out more about the mysterious boy.

 

“Um, hmm.” The boy reached into his pocket, pulling out a thin brown covered book with a cross on its front. He flipped through the pages before looking away. “It doesn’t have a name.”

 

“Interesting. It is forbidden for a member of our library to write about their experiences, so it makes sense that she wouldn’t put a name to it. Perhaps it was a confession to her children? Not many members see their family’s so it could have been a guilt thing.” Tricia had already theorized about who he really was. Perhaps the grandson of the wise Holly or the finicky Greta.  

 

“Tricia, there is no use guessing about his origins. We can resolve that if we need to later. For now, can you make sure the boy has a room and meal?”

 

“That means you’re offering me sanctuary? Thank you so much! I’ll clean or help out if you need it. I’ll even collect magical books if you want me to.”

“Collect magical books? Heh, that’s quite an offer. I don’t think you know how hard that is. What should we call you? We can’t just call out boy whenever we need to talk to you.”

 

“Henry. What about you, miss?”

“Kayla. Well, Henry, go with Tricia. She will show you around the library. I’ll discuss your sanctuary later. Oh, but before you run off. May I borrow that book?”

 

“Sure, just don’t get it dirty.” Henry handed the book over before following behind Tricia, the two exchanging a few bits of small talk as they went on their way. When they were out of earshot, Peter moved to Kayla’s side.

 

“What are we going to do with him? I thought he was just some beggar, but he seems to know an awful lot about us. Should we invite him to join? If it’s in his blood, then I don’t think anyone will have a reason to deny him.”

 

“Hmm. What he said interests me. How long has it been since we had a magical book hunter? A century or two? I know it’s dangerous work, but perhaps he would be interested in the training. We could use one, especially with the growing cases of magic turning up. How long can we keep covering every incident of a book unleashing spells or teaching someone magic?”

 

“I agree. It has gotten rather dangerous, but he’s just a boy. Surely one of us would be better equipped to handle it.”

 

“I’m not suggesting we send him out right away. It would be at least another twenty or so years before we do. I’ll be open to him about the risks, but I don’t believe this is a coincidence. For someone to wander into our library and declare sanctuary while having a book on our secretive purpose. That is too unlikely to be a coincidence.”

 

“I will always follow your decisions; I just hope you understand the future you are setting for him.”

 

“I will ensure his future is safe. If I don’t think he is strong enough, I won’t allow him to do any work for us. I don’t plan to throw someone blindly to their death, even if it would help us. We agreed to do this, he didn’t. He deserves to choose how he spends his life.”

“Of course. Then shall I see he gets enrolled in our classes too?”

 

“Yes, please. I will give him a few years to adjust to this life before discussing the training with him. We will just educate him in our ways for now. Ensure that he has skills so that he may one day leave and make a life for himself if he declines.”
Peter nodded, the bald man gathering a few books from the towering bookshelves before he went to find Tricia and Henry. Kayla watched, curious to know more about this boy. She flicked open the book, reading over the first few pages. “That looks like the writing of Elizabeth. I never knew she had a son, let alone a grandchild. I wonder what she would say about this if she were still here.” Kayla smiled, closing the book as she headed for her room, leaving Henry in the care of her fellow librarians.
