“This isn’t a home. It’s a house? They aren’t even trying with these welcome mats anymore; the hell is that supposed to mean?” I stared at the welcome mat, dragging my claws upon its nonsensical message. If I made the mistake of entering without permission, it would leave me with a crippling pain that could be the death of me. Still, I needed to feed. How cautious was too cautious?

 

Placing my paw upon the door, I went to force my way inside, only to get cold paws at the last moment. It was too risky, and this was only the first house on the street. I had time. I turned to the pavement, walking along the street, trying to avoid the gaze of pedestrians passing by.

 

“OOOOH, look mommy a kitty!”

 

“A kitty? I’m the third son of Marlas, the demonic embodiment of pride, you little-”

 

“Aw, meow, meow, meow. To you too, Mr. Kitty.”

 

My cheeks were smushed by the kid, the brat getting ice-cream all over my fluffy face. She pulled and pushed, leaving minty stains all along my fur until her mother finally pulled her away, giving me a chance to jump away.

 

“Don’t touch that. You don’t know where that cat’s been.”

 

“Where I’ve been? How dare you?”

 

I watched the pair walk away, praying they were on this street. I would show them who was a dirty cat. Unfortunately, they both got into a car, getting spared of my wrath. Continuing my search, I arrived at my next home. It looked like it belonged to either an old couple or someone that had no sense of tact. The lawn coated in shirtless garden gnomes and flamingos.

 

“We LOVE in HOUSE. Oh, come on. That’s worse than the last one. Is this some sort of riddle, or is everyone on this street sharing the same brain cell? That’s it. I’m actually going mad. Perhaps this is divine punishment by God? IS THIS FUNNY TO YOU GOD? COME DOWN HERE AND FIGHT ME.” I meowed at the heavens, only to dash into a bush when the clouds parted, keeping my head down until the clouds closed again.

 

“Can’t hear a prayer, but he can hear that?” I mumbled under my breath, dragging my tail along the ground as I went to the next house. This time I looked for one that was a little more normal. The one at the end of the street looked alright. Two car driveway, no tacky decorations and a rather nicely crafted wooden fence along its boundary. Yep, as normal as a Cerberus pup spitting fire onto the carpet.

 
When I made it to the door, I noticed this house didn’t have a welcome mat. Without a welcome mat, I was left with no other option but to turn back. I turned to make my way back to the pavement only to see a rather tall man dressed in a white, glowing suit. The man creepily smiling down at me as he approached the door. Underneath his arm, he had a stack of welcome mats and appeared to be fixated on me.

 

“Um? Meow, meow, meow?”

 

“Nice try.” He shooed me away from the door before giving it a knock. When the door opened, he began speaking to the couple inside, handing his extensive selection of welcome mats to them, allowing them to sample through them.

 

“I know it must sound crazy, but these keep demons out. It’s completely optional and free, of course. But, even if you don’t believe the crazy demon theory, they are quite funny, aren’t they? Just lay one outside and your family should be safe. Oh, and don’t let any strange animals in.” He said, turning the couple’s attention to me.

 

I glanced at the pair. My mouth hung open, about to bite the man on the ankle. When I noticed the eyes on me, I slowly took a step back, shutting my mouth, trying to pretend like I hadn’t been trying to deliver a painful bite.

 

“Are you saying that cat is a demon?” The man asked.

 

“Um? MEOW, MEOW, MEOW.” I imagined if I could sweat in this form, I would be. How the hell could a human figure this out? Unless they weren’t a human…

 

“Could just be a feral. As I said, it’s completely optional. I can only give advice, no matter how strange it might sound.”

 

“Well, this mat is kind of funny…. Maybe we could give it a shot?” The woman said, handing the stack of welcome mats back to the man, only keeping one. She laid the welcome mat down, giving me a chance to read it over. 

 

Coming or going? The mat said, furthering my frustrations. The conversation then finished, and the door shut. I went to bite the man, only to get flung back by a golden light.

 

“You must be starving. What a shame I’ve already visited every house in this area. I believe there’s one about thirty minutes away that you could try. Oh, that’s a thirty-minute drive, by the way. I hope those four legs of yours can run.”

 

“I thought angels weren’t meant to meddle in our affairs? Does God know about this?”

 

“Who do you think invented these welcome mats? It’s hardly meddling, it’s just giving the humans a fighting chance. We noticed how destructive demonic feeding was getting after the welcome mats, so we created an equalizer. We will only keep handing these out for free until companies start producing them. Once enough are in circulation, we will return to the sidelines.”
 

“I’ll show you a sideline. I’ll send you to the biggest sideline of them all, limbo.”

 

“Ok, how will you do that?”

 

“I, ugh.”

 

“That’s what I thought. You need to feed to use your stronger form, correct? Until you feed, you are just an annoyance. Like a fly. Anyway, I have to go. Here, have a free mat.”

 

I yelped as they dropped a mat on the floor in front of me, nearly smacking my head. The words on it reading. My gates of heaven. When I looked up from the mat, he was gone, leaving me to just angrily stomp on the mat before beginning my long journey to the next area, hoping he hadn’t got them first.
