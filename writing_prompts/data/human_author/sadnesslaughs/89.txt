“Hello, my beautiful winged angels. What are my friends up to?” I greeted the crows with a tip of my hat, offering them the same courtesy I always did. Oddly enough, they didn’t return my greeting. The group staring off to the end of the park, eyeing a set of swings. Was there a loose dog? A loose dog always disrupted the group. Staring at the spot, I waited for something to appear, only to watch the swings silently shift with the cool breeze, not a person or animal in sight.

 

“Oh, right. I didn’t offer you any food. You must be mad at me. What do you feel like today, my angels? How about some yummy seeds?” I slipped my fingers into my pocket, scooping a handful of seeds into my palm before offering it to the crows. “Here, Bon apatite.”

 

One crow turned to face me, staring at the seeds in my hand before turning away, returning their focus back to the swings. “Not hungry? Did I upset you? I thought we all got along.” I dropped some seeds onto the table, hoping that might encourage them to eat. Despite my best efforts, they remained focused on the swings, refusing to acknowledge me.

 

I was taking it personally, feeling a little insulted by their lack of interest. I went to voice my feelings, only for one crow to speak. “Hide,” the crow cawed, turning once more to stare at me before shifting back to the swings.

 

“Hide?’ Something had scared them, but what could frighten a murder of crows? Where their other birds or perhaps something that I couldn’t see? I backed away from the table, moving towards a tree, placing myself behind it. I’m not sure why I indulged their fears. Maybe it was because I had never seen them so scared before.

 

With each passing second, I felt a tension building in my stomach, searching for this mysterious fear that the crows held. After a few minutes passed, I went to step out from my hiding spot only for another caw to reach me. “No.” That was all the crow said, a simple no. This was getting ridiculous; I couldn’t wait any longer. As I went to leave the spot, a swoop of black feathers flew towards me, poking me in the face with its beak.

“What the hell are you doing? There’s nothing there.” The crow eventually stopped its attack, landing on my shoulder. Its wing pointed towards the swings as I looked once more, spotting a boy no older than ten swinging on the play set. Nothing about that would have been unusual if not for the pale, bald mask the boy wore. The mask had three holes cut out so he could see and talk. As he swung, he looked towards the crows, then at my tree. As his gaze landed on my tree, I ducked into hiding. Something about that kid wasn’t right.

 

I heard a set of soft feet hit the ground before the child’s footsteps began approaching our location. The air around me felt thin. With each step, my body shuddered. How close was he? When I heard his feet stop, I took another glance, spotting him staring at the table near the crows. The crows didn’t move, not even ruffling a feather, acting as though they were stuffed.

 

The boy stared over the table, sniffing the air before lunging for the seeds, digging his teeth into the table, tearing out chunks of wood as he devoured the seeds. Once he had his fill, he returned to looking. His eyes fell on me and, following the crow’s example, I froze, not moving a muscle.

 

Soft footsteps started again as he approached, sniffing the air before me. The seeds! He could smell the seeds! I carefully let my fingers slip into my pocket, reaching for the soft fabric of the pockets lining. When I had it gripped, I flipped my pocket inside out, spilling the seeds onto the ground.

 
It was impossible to do the action without being spotted and when I saw him lunge; I expected the worst. The boy landed by my feet, eating the seeds from the floor. He stuffed them through the hole in his mask, gnawing on them, getting his fill. With the meal consumed, he rose to his feet, heading back towards the swing set. As soon as he sat back down, he vanished, and the crows returned to their usual movements. The murder of crows taking flight, coming over to the tree I was hiding behind.

 

“Scared, Boy, Scared, Monster.” They cawed in unison. My shaky hand moved to the one on my shoulder, patting it. Was this why they always gathered shining offerings? Were they even eating the food I gave them or were they just storing it so they could offer it to the monster when he arrived?

 

“I’ll bring you more food tomorrow, ok?” I never wanted to return to this place again, the horror I witnessed enough to scar me for life. But, If I didn’t bring them offerings, what was stopping the boy from dining on the crows? I would need to keep visiting them, at least until I saved them. I owed them that much after they saved me.
