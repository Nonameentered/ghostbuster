It’s perfect, too perfect.

 

A shining staircase, the angelic sounds of harps and synchronized harmonies. Everything was a treat for my dying senses, which is why it was far too good to be true. At least, that’s what my gut was telling me. My hand gripped the marble railing, stopping to take one last look at the magnificent light shining down through the opened gates that sat atop the staircase. Did I really want to know if this was true? What would happen if I found out it wasn’t? Despite my nerves, I still readied the spell, hoping my body had enough magic left in it for one last disillusionment spell.

 

I had spent my life being cautious. I couldn’t stop now. Thanks to my distrust of others, I survived this long. If I didn’t do this, it would haunt my thoughts forever. My fingers twitched as the mana flowed through my arm, expelling the last remaining burst of magic through my fingertips. The green burst of energy floating temporarily blinding me. I waited until the stinging sensation passed before reopening them, viewing the staircase once more.

 

I couldn’t believe it. The stairs were still shining. For once, it was real. I gripped the railing, hugging it with all my might. How could I be such a fool? The gates of heaven couldn’t be forged. Such a holy thing was beyond such fake magic. Maybe I had been too cautious in life? If I hadn’t lived such a safe life, maybe I would have loved? Maybe I would have seen more of the world rather than just read about it. Maybe I wouldn’t have even doubted the gods?

 

“I’m sorry.” I clasped my hands together in prayer, hoping whatever angel or deity looked over this staircase would hear my words. Quickly I ascended the stairs, rushing towards the heavenly gates. Each step bringing me closer to its magnificent light, the shining aura of the heavens shimmering before me. It’s holy rays creating waves in the air, extending its light towards the platform before the gates.

 

With each step closer I got to heaven, the more my body grew lethargic. Those quick strides turning into slow, drawn-out steps. It was getting painful. Even the reward of heaven was feeling too small a prize for such a feat. Still, I carried on, my legs burning as I pulled my body to the top platform, finally getting a view through those gates, only to see the reality of the situation.

A single eye watched me, the eye only having a single blue pupil surrounded by a sea of darkness with only a few shining spots of golden light littered throughout the eye. At first, I thought the lights were just a way of luring souls up the stairs, only to realize the sickening truth. Those were souls. Every person who died became a part of this beast, each person becoming another light to draw more souls towards its body.

 

Slowly, its illusion dissolved around me. The stairs vanishing behind me, revealing the rounded stomach I had been climbing, the railing I had been clinging to earlier, now showing itself to be a row of strange spikes that climbed the beast’s body, leading all the way to the tongue that I was currently standing on.

 

Those heavenly angelic harmonies were now replaced by the screeches and wailings of trapped souls, each once pushing at the beast’s body, trying to claw their way out through it, but to no avail. They were trapped like I would soon be. My strength was gone, leaving me to just stare in horror as the tongue flicked my body into its mouth. 

Had my magic failed? Perhaps my dying body didn’t have enough energy to cast the spell. Or perhaps I just wanted to believe in the illusion so badly that I tricked myself. It didn’t matter now, none of it mattered. Even though I had been so careful in life, I still ended up as trapped as the others.
