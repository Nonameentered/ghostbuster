She’s just staring at me, hasn’t even blinked since she got in the car. Am I going too fast or something? Is she planning on murdering me? A hundred thoughts raced through my mind as I drove to her desired location. She was probably the second strangest customer I had, her heavy breathing and focused gaze sending shivers through my spine.

 

Maybe she was on some strange medication or something of the sort? That would explain the vacant look. I adjusted my rear-view mirror, trying to shift it away from her, wanting to avoid staring at her for too long. When the mirror was pointed away from her, she shifted across the backseat, getting into view again.

 

“Are you alright miss?” I asked, trying to keep a friendly tone to my voice, not wanting to get my rating destroyed by one bad passenger.

 

“I am. Do you think I’m pretty? You keep staring.” I wasn’t sure how to respond to that. Her words were far too normal for her thousand-yard stare. I turned my attention back to the road, idly tapping my fingers against the steering wheel, trying to buy some time, needing to think of a response.

 

“Yes?” I couldn’t say no. She had me in a corner and so I chose the option I thought would cause the least amount of drama. I hoped that would be the end of the conversation, but those words only spurred action in her. She leaned forward, resting her head next to mine, her sun kissed cheek pushing against my shoulder.

 

“Your kind aren’t as bad as people say they are.” She said cheerily, still not blinking, only keeping herself by my side as I focused on the road.

“My kind? Oh, you mean Uber drivers? Yeah, we don’t always have the best reputation, but we try. Most of us try at least. It’s not Uber if you don’t have at least one horror story from your time using it. It’s the luck of the draw, really.” I cracked a joke, but she didn’t laugh, only staying by my side until we left the busy streets of the town, heading onto the more isolated roads. After thirty minutes of driving through empty of roads, she tapped my shoulder, pointing to a vacant block of land.

“Just there is fine. I can get home from there.” She gave me a smile as she pushed herself back into the seat, waiting for me to come to a stop.

 

I pulled over on instinct, only to glance out at the open field. “Are you sure, miss? You still have thirty minutes left on your trip? I can take you the whole way if needed.” I felt a little bad letting her out in a place like this, but I couldn’t force her to ride the rest of the way.

 

“This is perfect. I’m nearly home.” I gave her a nod and said my usual spiel.

 

“If you enjoyed the ride, make sure to say your thanks with five stars!” She said nothing in response, only giving a nod of confirmation before she stepped out of the car. I watched her wander through the field before pulling out from the side of the road, driving to my next fare.

 

In the rearview mirror, I spotted a flash of white that vanished as quickly as it had appeared, leaving me to contemplate if I had even truly seen it. Maybe I was just sleep deprived? Instead of doing another fare, I headed home to get some rest, needing to sleep off the strange occurrence.

 

The next few days passed with no unusual activity. I did a couple of jobs here and there and continued my normal life. On the fourth day, however, I received a strange letter nestled between my bills. “From Queen Unive?” Opening the envelope, I found a nicely worded message inside.

 

 [Onok Ma! Victor,

I wish to thank you for your wonderful ride those few days ago. I know it isn’t much, but I would love to show my appreciation in the form of those stars you wanted so much. Please enjoy the deed. I will be by shortly to pick you up. I believe it is my turn to be the Uber. Hahahahahahahahahahahaha.

 

Love, Unive.]

 

Did she write her laughing into the letter? How did she find my name? I set the letter aside, retrieving the enclosed deed. The deed was written in a language I couldn’t understand. The only word that appeared in English was the word Cassiopeia. “This is really odd, even for a joke letter. Maybe I should tell someone about this?” As I stood dumbfounded in my room, a flash of white peered through my windows, the sudden assault of light blinding me.

 

When my sight returned, I was standing in the middle of a light pink metallic room. The room filled with soft furniture and an assortment of strange bubbling drinks and slimy foods. It was bizarre, becoming even stranger when that same woman from my Uber trip stepped out from behind a set of doors, smiling at me.

 

“Onok Ma, shall we begin the tour?”
