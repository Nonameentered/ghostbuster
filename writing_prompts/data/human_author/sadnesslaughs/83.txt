“Watch out!” I shouted, but it was too late, Milky the cow reared its legs and delivered a powerful blow to the level one adventurer, ending his quest prematurely. “Why does everyone stand behind the cow? My five-year-old son knows better than that.” I stared down at the adventurer’s body, his face twisted in a mess of loose flesh. Poor guy got his skull shattered by old Milky.

 

Taking off my leather hat, I held the piece to my chest. “May your soul find peace, brave adventurer.” Even an idiot deserved a nice send off. As I said a small prayer for the lad, two of his friends approached. Witnessing his body, they turned to me, drawing their swords.

 

“AHA! So, you are the first villain we encountered? I will avenge my dear friend.” The woman said, pointing her silver sword at me. I only raised my hands in self-defense. My hat waving in the breeze as I gripped it tightly.

 

“Yes, we will avenge our dear friend. Though our time spent together was short, we will never forget you, dear friend.” The male revealed his blade as the pair shuffled towards me.

 

“W-wait, you got the wrong idea. I didn’t kill your friend, it was Milky. The damn cow has a mind of its own. I’m sorry about your friend, truly, but you can’t take it out on me.” My fearful steps were slow, struggling to move. I took a final glance back at my property, seeing my dear son staring out the window. “Look away, boy, please, look away.” I begged, turning to the adventurers, wanting to try one last attempt at pleading with them, only to notice something. 

“WATCH OUT!”

 

The male dropped in a matter of seconds, falling atop the corpse of his fellow party member. The woman stood there stunned, before glaring at me, her pointed sword still facing my direction. “You dare train this foul beast to slaughter my dear friends. My dearest friend…” She paused, trying to remember the names of her party members. “Dearest friends…”

 

“How long have you even known these two?”

 

“Since this morning. But don’t let such a trivial piece of information impede my revenge. I am Abigail Stormbringer, Bloodhunter, Wardbreaker and the hero of Tusin.” She beamed as she said that, before biting her lower lip in thought. “And the avenger of my dearest friends.”

All level ones were the same. They just wanted that tragic backstory. She didn’t care about her ‘friends’, she just wanted that story to tell others at the tavern later tonight. Though it wouldn’t be much of a story if she didn’t avenge them.

 

“A farm can be a dangerous place. Please, return to the town. I assure you there're no quests or secret items to be found here. Just return to the town and maybe come back when you have gone up a few levels. I’ll even show you how to milk old Milky then.” I offered her a smile, which she scoffed at. Despite her hostile face, she slipped her sword back into its sheath.

 

“Very well. Avenging them this soon wouldn’t make for a good story. Tell me your name, so I know what to shout to hell when I send you there.”

 

“Peter. Oh, did you want my full name? Peter Danil. Some people call me PD, but I prefer just Peter or Pete, if you wish to be more casual. Pleasure to meet you.”

 

She frowned. Peter didn’t suit the narrative she was going for, that much was obvious from her stare. “Very well, Peter, the tamer of the wild beasts. I will return and make you join my comrades. Let it be known that from this day forward, you are my arch nemesis.”

 

“Just Peter is fine. I’m no tamer of wild beasts. Milky is a really nice girl if you don’t stand behind her, I promise.” My words were lost on the adventurer who only turned back to town. “Wait, aren’t you going to bury your friends?”

 

“Huh?” She turned to the corpses before continuing like she hadn’t heard me. “Yes, yes. Our battle will be grand.” She happily ignored my request, leaving me to deal with the bodies.

 

“She won’t be back.” I pitied the poor souls. She was the fifth person to swear vengeance on me this year and none had ever returned to claim my head. “Poor, poor souls. Mabel! Can you make sure our boy is alright? We had another incident again with the adventurers. Hopefully, there’s still room under the old shed to bury them.”

 

“Again? Damned adventurers are ruining my peaceful life. They didn’t threaten you again? Did they? I swear if they even thought about touching you, I would show them what a real adventurer could do.”

 

“Just a misunderstanding, dear. Remember, you’re retired now; us farmers don’t attack people with swords.” I said, putting my hat back on as I approached the bodies. “Sorry about this lads. Maybe someday a desperate necromancer will revive you?” I couldn’t help but feel a tinge of guilt as I began dragging them to the old shed. What had once been a vibrant place filled with horses and equipment was now a cemetery for foolish, low-ranking adventurers.

 

“Well, time to start digging.”
