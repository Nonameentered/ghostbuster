“So, how was your day, honey? Anything interesting happen?” Daniel asked, the beloved teacher still wearing his funky piano tie as he sat at the dinner table.

 

“Oh, you might find this interesting. Do you know Mr. Anderson? I believe he’s the father of one of your students.” Holly splashed some whisky from her flask into her spaghetti and meatballs, mixing the booze into her dinner before taking a hearty mouthful.

 

“Mr. Anderson? Yes, his son Michael goes to my school. He’s a wonderful student, but which student of mine isn’t wonderful?”

 

“That’s a bummer cause I found his dad dead in the sewers today. Think he might have been loaning money from the Ballar gang. Damn, shame. Least he still has his mother, though.” Holly looked at her spaghetti, considering adding more whisky to it before deciding it was easier to just down the flask.

 

“Ugh, I thought you both said you wouldn’t discuss work at the dinner table? This is family time.” Ria said, the magical daughter of theirs shape-shifting the food into various spaghetti monsters and creatures.

 

“And I thought we said no magic at the dinner table. Look, I’m sorry, how about we start this dinner fresh? Did you get up to anything fun today, sweetie?” Daniel tried to steer the conversation away from their jobs, but as always, the conversation found its way back to it.

 

“Well, today I had to rescue a falling school bus with my magical sun sun ray beam. After that I fought the evil Dr. Cavity at the dentist’s office and gave free lollypops to everyone there.”

 

“If you gave lollypops to everyone there, doesn’t that mean Dr. Cavity actually won? Sweets cause cavities. With enough lollypops, their teeth will look like the bullet hole covered corpse of a local banker after a robbery gone wrong. His eyes devoid of life, with that distant look of fear on his face as he finds out there is no heaven or hell, just eternal slumber.” The conversation fell quiet as Holly stared at the two, waiting for a response before deciding to lighten the mood. “But lollypops are nice.”

 

“Honey, did you consider seeing a therapist like we talked about?”

 

“Crime doesn’t wait for therapist appointments, plus I have Dr. Walker here in my flask to keep me company. I also have a loving family that I adore.”

“Aww, love you too.” Daniel leaned over, giving Holly a kiss on the cheek, much to the horror of Ria.

 

“Ew, don’t get all lovey dovey at the dinner table. They weren’t just lollypops either, they were magical lollypops, so they don’t cause cavities.”

Holly and Daniel looked at one another, certain that wasn’t how magic worked, yet neither wanted to start an argument, so they let the comment slide. The three returning to the meal only to be interrupted by a bickering at the door.

 

“And I said, Monday is my day to come here, see? Detective Holly needs a reminder to keep silent about the Anderson case or she will swim with the fishes.” A goon argued, only for another voice to join him.

 

“And I said that I need to challenge Super Miss Sparkle Flower to a duel after my horrifying defeat earlier today. How dare she make lollypops that reverse cavities? The world must feel as empty and riddled with holes as the frightening Dr. Cavity.”

 

“Um, I just wanted some help with my maths homework.” Billy said, the child standing behind the two villainous figures with a sheet of homework.

 

Daniel, Holly and Ria all let out a sigh as they stood up to excuse themselves from the table. The three family members sharing a look of exhaustion as they reminded themselves that busy lives like theirs never got a break, even for family time.

 

“Beat it, kid. Maths problems are below personal grudges on the list of importance.” The goon said, followed by Dr. Cavity.

 

“YES, beat it or I will give you a disgustingly sweet lollypop, one that will rot your teeth in a few years… if you don’t maintain proper hygiene and consume too many sweets but still it will be the first domino to fall in a downward spiral of tooth decay.”

 

“I actually wouldn’t mind a lollypop…”

 

“Really? Huh, well I guess if I give you a lollypop then it is a mighty victory for Dr. Cavity, hear that Super Miss Sparkle Flower? You couldn’t protect him from my grand power.”

 

Dr. Cavity handed Billy the enormous rainbow lollypop, before fleeing the house, the villain skipping along the lawn with glee, proud of himself for finally getting one minor victory over the magical girl. That just left Billy and the goon standing by the door.

 

“Did you want to speak to Mrs. Holly? She sometimes helps at my school, not many of the students like her since she always smells like grandpa. I can tell Mr. Daniels whatever you wanted to tell her, if you would like?” 

“Hmm, now that would be threatening. What better way to get to her than by passing the message onto her husband at his school? Then she knows we have eyes everywhere. You’re a genius kid. What maths problems did you have, anyway?”

 

“I just can’t figure out how to do subtraction.”

 

“Yeah, I remember finding that hard as a kid. Start with your fingers. Say you kill five wise guys and the boss orders you to take three bodies away. How many do you have left?” The goon held up five fingers, which Billy mimicked. After a bit of consideration, Billy lowered three fingers.

 

“Two?”

 

“Correct! See, you get the hang of it. Now just follow that same sort of rule. If you run out of fingers, use your toes too. Eventually, you won’t even need to use them, but it helps when you’re learning.”

 

“Thanks, mister. What did you want me to tell Mr. Daniels?”

“Just tell him that the Ballar family said his wife should look after her own family rather than the case.”

With that, the two left, leaving the family to return to the dinner table. They each sat down, a little confused by what they overheard before Holly spoke up.

 

“I don’t smell like someone’s grandpa, do I?”

 

“Well, I didn’t want to say this, but you do drink a little more than our usual school helpers. It’s not you that smells, it’s just you get booze breath.”

 

“Maybe I should drink light beer when I help at your school.”

“I think you might be missing the point, sweetie, but that’s a start. Anyway, who’s ready for dessert?”

 

“I am! Just make sure it isn’t too sweet. I don’t want to listen to Dr. Cavity ramble that I’m just like him, except less sugary.”

 

“What’s that even mean, sweetie?”

 

“I have no idea.”

 

With that, Daniel got out some ice-cream from the freezer, able to enjoy dessert with his family for once in moderate peace. The three individual stories coming together for some family friendly fun for the night.
