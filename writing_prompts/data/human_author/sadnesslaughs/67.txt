The darkness always whispered.

 

A looming threat that we all knew existed. None of us liked to talk about it, fearing that just a mention of it would bring it closer. It didn’t hunt, nor did it advance past the boundaries of our torches. All it did was wait hungrily in the confines of the night’s void, whispering lies, tempting us into hopelessness. When we reached that moment where we believed all was lost, we would walk away from the night fire and into the darkness, embracing whatever creature lurked in it.

 

We had lost three already to the darkness. One on the first night and two when the wine ran out. The wine had been our best weapon, a way to dull the senses. Unfortunately, those two had become reliant on its deafening liquid, and when the red liquid went dry, they spilt their own blood in exchange. I discovered their corpses that morning, torn to shreds by the darkness.

 

“How about a song? Maybe a dance?” I suggested, producing a pained grin. We had to keep up the cheer, at least until a ship arrived. Of all the islands to get shipwrecked on, we found the worst.

 

Their faces hung in their hands, no one responding. Defeat lingering in the air. I needed to rally them, the same way they had kept rallying me when I fell. I went to speak, only for that deep, treacherous voice to whisper in my ear.

 

“No one will care when they don’t find your body. You will be another death at sea as far as they are concerned. Why are you so adamant about returning? Pain only awaits you on land.” Its words like barbed wire wrapping around my throat. I could only imagine what the others were hearing.

 

I kicked my foot into the sand beneath my feet, throwing myself upright. My unsteady feet staggered before developing into a bouncing hop as I moved myself around the fire. That fake grin straining my cheeks. Only three of us were left. I couldn’t afford to lose anyone else.

 

My dance circled the fire until I arrived at the two, gripping their hands. “Come on, sing with me. What do we do with a drunken sailor?” I tried to get a jolly mood out of them, but the reality of the situation was sinking in.
“We can barely find enough wood to keep the fires going. Maybe we should just give up. The darkness said it would be quick.” Ralph conceded, moving his hand away from mine.

With my hand now free, I slapped him across the face. The smack grabbing the attention of Sally. I took his hand once more and gave another tug. “Theres enough wood to make the fire last for as long as it is needed. We have survived a week of this. We can survive a few more days. Help has to be on its way.”

 

Ralph didn’t seem convinced, but Sally had gotten herself to her feet. She helped me pull Ralph up, forcing him towards the flames with us. Sally and I kicked our legs, swinging them with an erratic vigor. With each kick, Ralph stumbled until we forced him to join in.

 

By the time we saw sun again, we were exhausted. Legs aching and our fake smiles twitching, struggling to stay up. Mornings were even worse. The threat of the darkness was gone, but we needed rest. Having to get resources and sleep in a brief period was exhausting. Looking out at the sea across from us, I prayed that help would arrive soon. We were losing hope.
