[Part 2 of 2]

The trip to the hospital was quick. Ben giving the man a $5 tip before heading inside. Inside, he flashed his badge to the man behind the counter, giving him the room number. They directed him to an elevator and told to check the right hallway of the third floor. In a few minutes, he had made his way to the room. Inside the room sat both Jacob and Officer Pauline. Pauline eagerly greeted Ben, relieved to have someone else in the room. Ben shook her hand in a silent greeting before turning to Jacob. Allowing Pauline a chance to get her phone ready to record the impromptu interview. 

 

“I can’t convince you to speak? Can you even speak, Jacob?” Ben crouched before the man, holding a hand to his cheek, keeping his gaze focused forward. “If this hurts, let me know and I’ll stop. I’m going to go a little deeper.”

 

The room was silent as the two maintained gazes. Ben still couldn’t see anything. No sounds or voices sat inside the man’s head, only blank nothingness. Despite this, Ben felt a rush of sadness, a despair creeping over him the longer he stared. Every part of his brain was telling him to sever the connection, but he pushed on, only to hear a small pop.

 

Jacob slouched forward, dropping to the floor. Blood oozed from his nose as he laid before the two officers. “WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?” Pauline screamed, crouching down to the body, pressing her fingers against his throat, checking for a pulse. “He’s dead.”

 

“Dead? That’s impossible. My abilities should cause only a mild headache at the worst of times. Even going deeper shouldn’t do too much damage to a person’s brain. There had to be another factor. Can you arrange an autopsy? I’ll call someone to take me in for questioning, I imagine I’ll have to explain my side of the incident to our higher ups.” Ben did his best to remain calm, but even as the phone left his pocket, he could feel his hand shaking, struggling to maintain his grip.

Nothing was said after that. They both made their calls, and when the officers arrived, they escorted Ben back to the station to give his report of the events. Thankfully for Ben, his higher ups were willing to believe his story. It was unheard of for a psychic investigator’s abilities to kill a person, leading them to believe some other form of foul play had to be involved.

 
The autopsy only confirmed that. Ben received a photo of the device found inside Jacob’s brain. It was a cylinder shape with sharp metallic rods poking out from underneath it. The rods would have been pushing directly into the brain before it overloaded. It was hard to say how the device worked, given its condition, but one thing was certain. The criminals had upped their game.

 

They had stopped the investigators from reading into the minds of their members. Even if the device appeared to damage the gang member, they attached it to. Ben’s notebook now filled with various questions.

 

How did the device get there?

Why would someone get the device put into their brain?

What does the device do?

How widespread is this technology?

Did the victim know the effects of the device before it was implanted?

 

Ben rubbed his forehead as he pondered the questions. He wasn’t sure if it was the use of his abilities, or the various questions laid before him that was causing his head to ache. Either way, he needed some rest. Flipping his notebook shut for the day, he headed home. Hoping there might be additional evidence waiting for him tomorrow.
