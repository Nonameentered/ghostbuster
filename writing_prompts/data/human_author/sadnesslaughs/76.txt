“You humans are awfully cocky, aren’t you? It took me fifty years to even get considered for an investigative position and you take the job after only five years on the force. You haven’t put it in work like the rest of us did.” Halk couldn’t believe these humans were becoming so popular on the force. It felt like only yesterday that a human wouldn’t be allowed ten feet near a crime scene and now you had them walking all over them.

 

“I told you. Us humans have short life spans; I wouldn’t be able to do this job if it took me fifty years of experience. Our knowledge is better suited for the task, anyway. Crime scene investigation is new to your kind, us humans have been doing it for centuries.” Evan fixed his brown leather jacket, adjusting it so his badge covered his coffee stains. “Ready to go in?” He glanced up at the towering figure beside him, waiting for her response.

 

The average height of a Namilon was six foot eight, something Evan was rather envious of. His coworker reached seven feet, having three grey eyes and no nose. The Namilons breathing through the small bubble-like holes in their throat, having no need for a nose. She had a deep orange tone to her skin, making her stand out even more than she already did when standing next to a rather plain looking human.

 

“Always. I haven’t had a chance to see a human at work yet. I want to see what all the interest is about.” Before the two entered the pub, Halk turned to Evan. “What is your lifespan? You should have had that tested during your physical. I will live to a healthy three hundred if I keep to my current training and diet. What about you?”

 

“I didn’t want to know.”

 

“Didn’t want to know? What because it’s Namilon technology? Our medical technology is the envy of the Council.” Halk couldn’t help but get defensive. Not only had these humans pushed their way onto the Council, now they were refusing to use alien technology.

“It’s not that. I know how good your testing is. I just didn’t want to know. Look, if you really want to know, go request my file. All I know is, the ones that did my test looked rather concerned. Whether that’s because they haven’t seen many human lifespans or because of something else, I don’t know.” Evan hoped that would sate her curiosity, but Halk had already stepped through the small doorway. She blocked him, wanting to get one last question in before they arrived at the body.

 

“What if you have an illness? It could be prevented if you know beforehand.” Halk couldn’t wrap her head around this. The technology was only beneficial. Shouldn’t he be rushing to know something like that?

 

“If that were the case, they would have told me. Humans are new to the Council, that means your kind haven’t had a lot of time to work out our diseases and illnesses. It doesn’t take a detective to know that whatever they found out wasn’t good news. Who knows, maybe by the time I reach that estimated end, that won’t be the case.” He gave her a smile before placing a hand on her jacket, politely nudging her aside.

 

The two found the body in a rather messy pose. Their face pressed against a bar counter, with a few teeth scattered around them. Despite the evidence of a physical altercation, the deceased also had a bullet hole through their skull. Evan counted the number of teeth, spotting three in his view.

 

The victim was a Litorna male. His skin was a light shade of blue. Like the rest of his kind, he had pointed fleshy triangles atop his head. He appeared to be missing one of his triangles, the missing triangle having a light bit of scarring around the area. On the countertop next to the teeth was a puddle of green blood, most of which was dry. Putting on a glove, Evan collected a tooth.

 

“Tooth belongs to the victim. It might seem obvious, but it’s important to check. Could be a canine tooth given its sharpness, but Litorna’s have sharp teeth. What do you think?”

 “I think what tooth it is hardly matters. Did you notice his skin? Its light, most likely the victim was at least one hundred. Their skin grows lighter as they age.” Halk was determined to show the human up, already scanning for whatever clues she could find while Evan fixated on the tooth.

 

“I did. Good pickup. The tooth is important in identification. He might have dental records, we can look up. But I’m sure you already know that. I know it might be a long shot, but I’m hoping the tooth might give us an idea of where the attacker was standing when they struck him. If he is missing left teeth, I assume the attacker was on his right when they pushed his head into the counter. Do we have any footage?”

 

“Sounds like a long shot to me. Where he was standing doesn’t seem that important. Is this the best you humans can do?” Halk retrieved her phone from her pocket, entering a code on the screen. She waved her phone in the air, moving it near a security camera only to let out a huff. “No footage. It must have been deleted.”

 

“We can ask the owner about that later.” Evan placed the tooth down, looking the body over. “He’s missing a spike. Looks like it was cut off.”

 

“Most likely. It has scarring, though. So, I doubt it happened here. It’s not a spike either, the correct term is an external skin Daloid.”

 

“That’s not the point. It could be related to the crime. Maybe he had debt? It seems like a good way to send a message. Maybe this was the outcome of that message not being taken seriously?” Evan wanted to tell her that the correct term didn’t matter, but he let it slide. He needed to learn the correct terms for things. She had a point.

 

“What about the bullet? Want me to pull it out?” Halk reached for her glove, only for Evan to grab her arm.

 

“No, don’t do that. We can take it in for an autopsy. Let them remove it. Don't dig through his head. Speaking of the bullet, do you find it odd they shot him? The wound to the front of his head looks like they would have been enough to kill him. Do you think the bullet was an attempt to throw us off?”

 “It could be someone making sure that they killed the guy. I just don’t get how they could do it in a crowded pub and sneak out with no one grabbing them.” Halk moved her hand away, causing Evan to stumble over his feet, having to grab onto her again to regain his balance. He got the message though, releasing his grip after he had gotten his balance.

 

“They could have been scared. Or maybe people fled after they fired the gunshot? You can see nail marks near the fire exit. People were clawing at the walls to push past one another. People could have just assumed it was a fight. Maybe everyone turned a blind eye to it at first? Fights happen at pubs all the time. Let’s just wait for forensics to give us the results of whatever blood they find on the scene. We should get ready to conduct interviews.”

 

“Right. I’ll be the good cop.” Halk said, getting out her phone once more, sending a message to the team, letting them know to keep the area under surveillance until the evidence is gathered.

 

“No offence, but I doubt anyone would fear me when I’m standing next to you. I think you would be the bad cop if we were to do it. You know that routines a bit of a cliché though, right?”

 

Halk only gave a smirk, nodding her head. It was the first time he had seen her smile in his company, something that took him a little by surprise. “I know, but I’ve always wanted to do it.”

 

“Ok, we can try it. You’re the bad cop though, humans already have a strange reputation. I would prefer not to be the one that causes my kind to lose their seat on the Council.”

 “Fine.” The two walked in silence, heading back to the station only for Halk to sigh, feeling the need to say something. “You did ok today, you didn’t impress me, but you are at the very least competent. I will admit the forensics your kind have brought are proving useful, too. Just don’t start thinking you are better than us. We were solving crimes before your kind arrived on Talioria.”

 

“I know. You’re a fine detective Halk and I’m sure with our advancements, you will only get better. I think this is a good chance for us both to get better at our jobs.”

 

“Yeah, I like the sound of that.” With that, the pair headed into the station, finding an office room to begin their preparation for the interviews.
