“It ate the bad guys?” I turned to what I had lovingly titled a husk in my notepad, staring the corpse over. It didn’t look that different from a human, only distinguishable by its greying skin and icy touch. It was mute, or at the very least, didn’t care to say anything to me. Mr. Reyes merely stared back at me, waiting for my conversation to end with little Lucy.

 

“It did. Mom said so. She said all the bad guys were just gone, but she doesn’t know where they went.” Lucy threw her hands up, excitedly talking about the horrific event with a wide grin. It was always unnerving seeing a child describe something that most adults wouldn’t be able to stomach. Her innocence was commendable, considering she had a shambling dead man standing behind her.

 

“Was your mother certain he ate them? Eating someone isn’t something that can be done in a matter of seconds.” I felt stupid saying that, but when you are discussing the unknown, you have to engage with the strangest of possibilities, no matter how unlikely.

 

“Momma said he ate them, so he ate them.” She stomped her foot, reminding me why interviewing a child was a bad idea. It was near impossible to get good evidence from a child, but with her mother in hospital after the attack, it didn’t feel right leaving her alone with this mysterious Mr. Reyes, using the interview as an excuse to check up on her.

 

“Right, thank you for your help.” I pulled out three lollypops, each decorated in a different, colorful coating of sugar. “Take your pick.”

 

“I want… ALL THREE.” She said with a cheer, trying to snatch them from me. I held the lollypops back until she stopped reaching for them. When she settled down, I handed the treats to her, giving her all three.

 

“There. Mr. Reyes, would you mind if I had a word with you? It isn’t everyday I get to talk to a person without a pulse. Well, a person without a pulse that moves.” I gave a soft laugh that didn’t get any response from the man. The tall, imposing figure having patches of hair missing from his head, not to mention a few small holes in his body which showed the other side of the room, if one were to peer through them.

Mr. Reyes didn’t give me an answer, only moving to sit on the couch, patting the spot next to him. The spot he patted was a little too close for my comfort, so I politely sat a few cushions away.

“Thank you. I’m not sure if you understand it, but what you did is murder or maybe manslaughter, depending on what the courts think. From what I understand, you ate those men. May I ask how?”

Mr. Reyes folded his hands into his lap, sitting in silence. I couldn’t tell if there were any thoughts going through the man’s head, but I gave him a little longer than usual to answer. When a minute passed, I continued my questioning.

 

“Are you planning to live here now, Mr. Reyes? From what I have seen in your file, you hold no relation to this family. They have, for lack of a better word, adopted you. Why did you choose to help her? Does she hold some significance to you?”

 

Mr. Reyes only gave me a shake of his head as he sat stiffly on the couch. Not feeling the need to elaborate any further on the gesture.

 

”I see. Well, with no bodies, it will be hard to convict you. Most people won’t believe the story that Lucy’s mother told us, either.” This was going nowhere quickly; the man didn’t seem like a danger, but I didn’t want to leave until I was certain of it. “You have a name? Lucy’s mother, Mary, mentioned you saying a name. Can you tell me?”

 

His lips opened, and he hit my ears with a strange frequency. A deafening buzzing echoed through them, drowning out any other noise with its grating clash of metallic buzzes. The sound soon fell away, leaving me to rub my ears. “She did mention it was hard to say.” I mumbled under my breath. They weren’t human, that much seemed clear. Or if they were human, they were the greatest actor alive.

 

My notepad was still rather empty, only able to jot down that they indeed did not appear to be human. “Well, I think I have gotten all I can get out of you. From what I have gathered from your file, you live a law-abiding life despite this recent alleged altercation. You work even if you do it in silence and you pay your taxes. I can’t say this will be the last time I speak to you, but for now, I have gotten as much as I need.”

I turned to leave, pulling my card from my pocket. Handing my number to Lucy just in case. “Call me if anything changes. If you notice any strange behavior, please notify me. Your mother will be home in an hour. I would prefer to stay and wait, but I need to meet with my team.”

 

“That’s ok. Mr. Reyes is nice. He won’t hurt me. Thank you for the lollypops, Mr. Officer.” She gave me a wave as I opened the door, only for a hand to tap my shoulder. The husk stood behind me, waiting for me to give him the attention he wanted.

 

“I protect, don’t hurt.” He pulled out a small clipping from his pocket. It appeared to be a scrap from a comic book showing a brightly dressed hero in spandex fighting off a bunch of attackers. In the panel next to it, it showed that same man in a suit, tapping away at a keyboard, working a normal life. “Protect.”

 

I stared at the clipping, giving him a nod. “Right, like the heroes do. Just don’t start taking justice into your own hands, ok? Heroes don’t allegedly eat people.” The whole situation was farfetched, but at least I had a potential motive. Well, maybe a microscopic one, but it was more than I had gotten out of anyone else. I let myself out, heading to my car, returning to the station, still trying to process the strange case of Mr. Reyes.
