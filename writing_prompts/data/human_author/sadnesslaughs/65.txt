“I would love to give you a dodo, but we kind of, um, made them extinct?” Of course, they made me do the negotiations. If anyone was going to get killed, it would be some lowly zookeeper, not a politician. Sure, a zookeeper is great at making diplomatic relations between aliens and humans. That is entirely what I studied at university for.

 

“Extinct? I’m sorry, my English isn’t very good. I don’t believe I’m familiar with the word. Are they off world?” The aliens one eye stared through me, feeling a few beads of sweat pool on my back.

 

“Well, it means we killed them all. Granted, it wasn’t entirely our fault. Maybe eighty percent of it was our fault, but there were natural causes too.” I assured the alien, trying to save some face for humanity.

 

“Oh, you killed them all? What savagery. Ah, it must have been because they were so fierce. Were you at war with the dodos? I thought from our scouting reports, the birds were rather harmless. Perhaps our scouts got lucky?”

 

“Yes, they were terrifying. I remember finding a journal from my great-great-grandfather about how a group of dodos tried to demolish his town. Quite fierce indeed. We really had no other choice.” I explained, feeling the sweat drip further down my back, gathering at the midpoint. I had to shift in my seat to stop the cool chill.

 

“I’m sorry to hear that. My condolences. If I knew, I would not have asked. How about the Tasmanian tiger?” The alien stared at me, their worm shaped lips pointing upwards into what I assumed was a smile. Or at the very least, an imitation of one.

 

“Oh, a Tasmanian tiger?” I grabbed my glass of water, taking a drawn-out sip as I planned an excuse. “Heh, that’s a funny story.”

 

“Are they extinct too?”

 

“No, of course not. We would have to be real monsters to let two whole species go extinct. Heh…” Come on, think. I need an excuse. “Well, you see. Tasmania is a rather dull place. Don’t get me wrong, it’s lovely and I would recommend you take a holiday there. But it can be rather quiet. So, the Tasmania tigers took a little holiday to other regions and rebranded. They are now just called tigers. To… Account for their change?” I returned to sipping my water, hoping they would buy the excuse. 

“You’re telling me a whole species just rebranded? How does a creature rebrand itself?”

 

“It changes its identity. Gets rid of that old, stale image and becomes more modern. It’s pretty standard in human culture to rebrand. Think about the reach that it gained by becoming a tiger. It’s no longer limiting itself to just Tasmania. It went worldwide.”

 

“I didn’t know creatures could do that. I will be excited to see that when we get a tiger for our zoo. Ok, so we have confirmed tigers, penguins, seals, dolphins and squids. I think that about covers our talks for now. It has been a pleasure to speak to you.” The alien offered me their two fingers to shake, which I gratefully accepted.

 

“The pleasure was all mine. Sorry about the lack of Dodos or Tasmanian tigers. It honestly can’t be helped. Sometimes things like that just happen. Sometimes animals just die or rebrand, really, it’s out of our control. Rather sad.” I let go of their hand, feeling a slight relief as they got out of their seat.

 

“It is. I’m just happy to learn it wasn’t entirely humanity’s fault. If it were, we might have to kill you all to preserve your planet’s peace. Maybe turn Earth into a zoo. That could be nice.” The alien thought aloud. “Luckily, you humans aren’t barbarians. Thank you for the animals. We will contact you later to give you some of our creatures in exchange.”

 

“Don’t rush to contact us again.” I said, not sure how I would explain what had just happened to the rest of the planet. In the end, I decided I would just keep it to myself and hope they didn’t fact check my information.
