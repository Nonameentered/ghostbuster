“You must introduce me to your handsome friend. My eldest daughter would be a perfect match for him, please you both can visit my manor and we can discuss the marriage. My family line contains some of the finest soldiers in the Halma region. A marriage between them would secure a noble hero, I’m certain of it.” Lady Helene Sissel held Devan by his wrist, refusing to let the hero leave without properly introducing his iron covered partner. No matter how much Devan struggled, her grip remained tight.

 

“I would love to introduce him, really I would, but we are both heroes. We can’t rest until we save the world. If you wish, I could remind him to visit you after our adventuring days are finished? You wouldn’t want him to settle down so soon, would you? His legend has only just begun.” If Devan couldn’t free his wrist, he would have to use his words, trying to appeal to her sense of legacy to get free. Lady Helene loosened her grip, allowing Devan to pull free. The mage adjusting his robes in a slight huff, annoyed she had manhandled him so easily.

 

“Hmm, you raise a fair point lesser hero. I suppose marriage would slow him down and my daughter wouldn’t agree to a husband that would abandon her to go on long journeys. Fine, inform him of my intentions. I expect to hear from him in the coming years.” Lady Helene pointed to the door, only for Devan to cough. “What is it?”

 

“My gold? For helping clear out your goblin troubles. I know I’m a noble hero and all, but adventuring requires funds.” Devan didn’t mind waiving their fees for those that couldn’t afford it, but she had money to spare. Not to mention her earlier insult hadn’t gone unnoticed.

 

“Marriage to my eldest daughter isn’t considered enough of an award?” She scoffed, only for Devan to wiggle his hand in front of her, waiting for the gold.

 

“Last time I checked, I wasn’t the one getting married in that situation.”

Lady Helene snapped her fingers, calling over her attendant, getting them to bring the promised fifty gold coins to her. “This is why you don’t get any proposals, mage. No one likes a person who cowers behind their powerful friend. Or one that takes gold off harmless civilians. You should try being more like your silent, handsome friend.” Helene continued to take verbal jabs at Devan until the gold arrived. As soon as the gold pouch landed in his hands, he turned and left.

 

“I don’t cower. What would she know? She’s never even been in a battle? Who is she calling harmless, anyway? She has her own guards for crying out loud.” Devan cast a small bubble over his lips, muting his little angry outburst from prying ears. It frustrated him, every noble or royal was infatuated with his partner Ashton and yet he never got a mention of the credit. They always referred him to as Ashton’s friend, never given the same prestige as his friend.

 

Devan stewed about it for a little before eventually calming down, concluding that it was probably fair. Ashton deserved a lot of the praise. Devan was like the Dulcimer player behind a bard, the one that kept the song going but didn’t grab the hearts of the watching patrons like Ashton did. As he approached the forest surrounding the manor, he paused, glancing at a tree marked with a horizontal sword cut. “He’s not here…”

“Ashton buddy, where are you? I knew I should have tied him to a tree. Ashton, come on, this isn’t funny. I told you not to wander off alone.” Devan’s calls for his friend started low, only to grow more panicked with each passing second. “ASHTON, WHERE ARE YOU? I WON’T LOSE YOU AGAIN.” Devan moved through the forest, listening for anything that sounded like armor moving.

 

Eventually, he found the break he was looking for, a creaking sound of metal drifting from a nearby river. Devan rushed to the location, panting as he arrived. “Ashton, I told you not to leave that spot. If someone finds you, it would be bad for the both of us.” Devan took some breaths between his words, only to spot what Ashton was doing. The six-foot five armored hero was on his knees, his helmet sitting at his side as he stared into the water, looking at his disfigured reflection.

 

“Ashton. I didn’t want you to find out like this. Please tell me you don’t recognize any of this.” Devan crept forward, placing a hand on the back of his friend, staring into the water with them. Ashton’s right eye gone, and their nose had been hastily stitched back on. Ashton kept staring into the water, leaving Devan to sit by him, his guilt piling in the lower pits of his stomach. 
“I’m not sure if you're conscious of this. If you are, let me tell you what happened. You gave your life for me ten years ago, took a shot that would have cleaved my body in two.” Devan gave a small chuckle before looking away from the reflection. “But it only split your skull. A shot that would have torn me apart only did that to you. I thought I could heal you, but all I did was trap your soul in a husk. A husk that still can fight. I know some part of you is still in there and that’s why I want to bring you back. I’ll fix your body too when I do, don’t worry.”

Ashton never moved much outside of battle, but somehow, he felt even more still to Devan on this occasion. “I’m a horrible person, I know. You were just so incredible. Even in death, everyone loves you. What sort of idiot would die for a mage that cowered behind him? I have to make this right; you deserve to live.” Devan sniffed back his emotions, shaking his head. “I’m not even that good of a hero. Without you, I would have died on far too many occasions. I’m trying to be like you, though. I’m sorry, Ashton, you deserved better out of life. If you were in my shoes now, you would have found a way to revive someone. You wouldn’t be kissing noble ass and failing.”

 

Devan stared at his reflection in the water, only to feel a cold metallic hand hit his back. The movement alone causing him to break down into tears. “E-even now you are a better man than me. See, this is why the world needs you.” Devan turned to Ashton, who had already set his helmet back on, rising to his feet. The tall husk of his friend offering a hand.

 

Devan wiped his eyes before accepting the hand and rising to his feet. “I promise I will fix this. Now, let’s get moving. We might find a lead in the next town.”
