“A ship came in?” Henderson tightened his grip on the shell shaped communicator in his hands, staring out at the massive ship that was currently waiting to enter their docking bay. The ship coated in the silver and gold colors of the United Molia division. “We didn’t order a ship. Did you check it for soldiers? I don’t want a trojan horse situation.”

 

It would be a shame to turn down a ship of that magnitude, Henderson knew that better than anyone. The Molia division was small, only having a joint force of around five thousand with very limited fire power. The only thing keeping them alive was the brilliant Elizabeth Brown. A woman that was the envy of planets galaxy wide. Henderson called her the maestro, and for excellent reason. Her inventions kept this colony of one hundred thousand people alive. Without her, their weaponry would have already been overpowered.

 

Silence fell on the other side of the line, Henderson tapping his fingers against his desk, waiting for a response. Ship scans did often take a few minutes to perform, but this was getting ridiculous. “Is there anybody on the ship? I’m not giving it clearance until I know what we are dealing with, soldier.”

 

Henderson’s tapping grew quicker as he watched the ship move, defying his orders as it approached the dock, parking itself right in the middle of their shipyard. If this ship was hostile, they would all be dead. “WHO GAVE YOU CLEARENCE? ANSWER ME.”

 

“Relax sir, we found an Id tag. Elizabeth is on the ship.” When those words reached his ears, he felt an instant breeze of relief. “Sorry, was going to tell you earlier, but I thought you would have seen it on your monitor. You aren’t still using that tacky old communicator, are you?” The voice had an air of easiness to it, caring little about the correct way to speak to someone higher in the chain of command.

 

“You know damn well I hate those monitors. They pick up too many false flags. When Elizabeth makes the upgrades to them, I’ll start using mine.” Henderson glanced at the dust covered monitor on his desk, flicking it on, checking the name of the soldier he was talking to. “Oh, and Max. You’re on cleaning duties in the kitchen this week. I shouldn’t need to tell you how to talk to your commander.”

 

Silence again came from the communicator. Only to be followed by a string of muffled curses before Max shifted closer to his device. “Got it sir, sorry.” Another curse followed before the communication line went down. Max cursing himself for not hanging up the line before Henderson checked.

 
Henderson smirked, always enjoying putting a cocky soldier in their place. Heading down to the dock, Henderson found his soldiers standing before the ship. Up close, its true beauty was revealed. A thick layer of aluminum made up the skin of the ship, with a few patches of what Henderson suspected were titanium covering some of the more sensitive areas. Normally this would throw off the balance of a ship and yet it appeared to float effortlessly from the little demonstration she gave.

 

“Why is no one checking out its interior?” Henderson asked the group, only for a familiar-sounding voice to answer.

 

“She wants to speak to you first, says it’s important. You aren’t dating our brilliant mechanic, are you?” Max quipped, only for Henderson to raise two fingers towards him, threatening him with two weeks of cleaning. “Ah, forget I said anything.” Thankfully for Max, the ship had extended its ramp, distracting Henderson from issuing more punishments.

 

Heading up the ramp, an array of dazzling lights greeted Henderson. The lights on the floor motioning him through the ship with their golden aura, directing him where to go. “Elizabeth, are you in here?” Henderson asked, while the ramp closed behind him.
