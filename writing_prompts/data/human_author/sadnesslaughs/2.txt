“How many bee stings do you think it takes to kill a man? Take a wild guess. We have some time before your guards arrive.” Verix flipped through the pages of his book of necromancy, not paying much attention to the captive noble that was currently being circled by his swarm of bees.

 

“A thousand? Two thousand? More bees than you have available. Do you really plan to threaten me with such a pitiful swarm of bees? I’ve heard you can surround a town in a cloud of bee’s, why bring such a pitiful amount? You should leave before my guards kill you. I promise you, when you die, no one will bring you back to life.”

 

Verix didn’t respond at first, flicking to the next page of his book. Noble Gallard might have questioned if he was even listening, if not for the crude smile that had found its way to his lips. Verix lowered the book to his waist, turning to face the noble.

 

“That’s a rather good guess and observation. I knew I was right in seeking you out. Yes, my numbers are currently rather light, but that’s only because I have my dominant forces deployed elsewhere. What you see before you are my personal guard. The one’s that protect their king.”

 

“Well, king. How will this personal guard kill me?”

 

“Reanimation gives them a unique quality. Unlike their normal counterparts, these bees are far more durable and will often remove their stingers without causing themselves harm. Of course, mistakes still happen. I don’t need a horde of one thousand bees to take you down. Just the nice handful at my disposal should do a trick.”

 

Verix instructed one bee to land on the nose of Gallard, allowing Gallard to cross his eyes for a better view of the horrible thing. Its body was covered in a light green hue, and it reeked of death. The smell stinging the nobles nose, never having smelt something so offensive. He tried to swat the bee away, only to halt his hand, knowing any movements might alert the horde circling him.

 

“This is why I like you, sir, Gallard. Other nobles failed that little test of mine and yet you endured it. You’re one of the rare men worthy of their reputations. I didn’t believe those grand war stories your people sung about you, but the more I look at you, the more I believe them. Sure, you might be a shell of that former man, but I’m seeing cracks in that shell the more I talk to you. Perhaps we can break that other you out?”

 

The bee flew away, giving Gallard a chance to suck in a deep breath of fresh air. His eyes continued to observe the horde, looking for an opening but finding none. Escape was impossible, and the necromancer knew it. Verix able to laze about the nobles bedroom while he spoke.

 

“What is it you want? You’ve spent the last few months terrorizing villages and killing noble families. Is it all just for fun?”

 

“What about this appears fun? I would much rather be doing other things with my time, unfortunately this is all necessary for me to gain my rightful place.”

 

“As king?”

 

“Bravo. You are quite good at picking up on these things. If I were a maiden, I think I would have swooned for you.” Verix laughed, standing up from his chair. “Yes, I wish to make myself king. I have shown my power, but I understand that power alone isn’t enough. Kings need friends. I want us to be friends, Sir. Gallard.”

 

“What makes you think I would align myself with you?”

 

“Apart from the fact you have little say in the matter?”

 

“Yes, apart from that.”

 

“Well, kings take good care of their loyalist of subjects. I’ll make sure you and your family keep your noble positions. I’ll even make sure you're given additional land for your allegiance.”

 

“I see. What if I decline?”

 

Verix didn’t give a response. Instead, he let the circle of bees shift closer, closing the distance between themselves and the noble. Their buzzing ringing in his ears as they got close enough to nearly touch his skin before backing off once more.

 

“I guess I have no choice but to accept.”

“Wonderful. I admire you Sir. Gallard. I truly do. Most people in your position would be too clouded with their own bravado to see the bigger picture. You are amazing beyond belief. I will call for you when I have the need. Until then, I suggest you keep your mouth shut about our brief exchange. Oh, and when your guards arrive, tell them they have nothing to fear from me.”

 

The swarm of bees left the noble’s side, allowing him to take a step forward. He watched as Verix turned his back, heading for the bedroom door, only for Gallard to reach into his sock, retrieving a dagger. He lunged forward, aiming for his back, only for the swarm of bees to fling themselves towards the noble, showering him in stings. Despite the stings, he still pushed forward, trying to will himself to Verix.

 

His pained steps growing closer as he finally reached Verix, only to lose his strength. Unable to do little more than poke the dagger at his robes, unable to even cut the fabric before he collapsed. Verix let out a sigh, turning to face the dying noble. 

 

“I hoped you wouldn’t do something stupid. I did like you, Gallard. You were supposed to be by my side during this. No matter, there are plenty of other nobles that have less honor. At least you get the gift of dying with my respect.” Verix then took the dagger, delivering the killing blow before leaving the room, his bees forming a protective circle around him as he left.
