“Is that Steve Irwin?” John said, the newcomer staring at the divine man on the television, unable to comprehend the raw manliness that was the great Steve Irwin.

 

“That’s Saint Irwin to you. But to answer your question, yes, that is the great crocodile hunter that you grew up watching.” The angel didn’t bother glancing John’s way, too transfixed by the golden aura that surrounded Saint Irwin. He was special. Even in the afterlife, he had something that just ascended him above the rest.

 

“That I grew up watching? How did you know I grew up watching him?”

 

“I’m an angel. I know everything about you mortals. Should I recount your history, or do you believe me?”

 

“I believe you. I just can’t believe it’s really him. The crocodile hunter, Steve Irwin.”

 

“SAINT IRWIN.” The angel said, giving John a smack across the back of the head.

 

‘Ow, right, Saint Irwin. He looks the same, like he hasn’t aged a day.”

 

“It’s heaven. When you die, you become your best self. Take your own form, for example. You died at the age of forty and yet you have the body of your twenty-five-year-old self.”

 

“But Saint Irwin didn’t die at his peak?”

 

“That man was always at his peak. Like the gods, he is a figure that transcends the rest of us. You would do well to show him more respect.”  

 

The two stared at the golden television floating above them. Even the angelic being couldn’t resist watching his show. Usually such a pause in the line to heaven would have caused a riot or at the very least some pushing and shoving, but with the screen in view of the waiting mortals, everyone just watched in awe, wondering what he would wrangle next.

 

A few hushed whispers crept through the line as Saint Irwin traversed the golden landscape of heaven. His Khaki shorts making him stand out among the angelic filming crew he was travelling with. He stopped before a glowing circle of liquid, crouching by it. He let his hand dip into it before pulling it out, revealing a small, shelled creature. Its shell was coated in small silver spikes that Saint Irwin carefully avoided, laying his palm as flat as possible to avoid getting poked.  

 
“What a beauty we have here today. This creature is known as a Winged dream eater. Now don’t let the appearance fool you. These beauties can fly using a hidden set of wings.” Irwin said, motioning the camera closer, tilting the shell towards them. “See those little black leathery bits of skin attached to the creature? Those are the wings. This creature sits in these little dream ponds and waits for a mortal to fall asleep, only to latch onto them and absorb their dreams for subsidence.

 

The angel clutched their hands together in prayer, almost seeming rather emotional about the show. John was eagerly absorbing the information. Feeling like his six-year-old self again. The show bringing back memories of his life in rural Australia. How he would sit before the tv at six am and watch the legendary Steve Irwin entertain and educate the next generation. His love of animals infectious, even in the afterlife.

 

“I never could have imagined something like this would exist in heaven.” John said.

 

“That’s why Saint Irwin is so important. He is the one that ventures beyond the safety of our pearly gates. He goes where no one else will go and does it with a smile on his face. We are blessed to have him.” The angel then shushed John, wanting to hear whatever came out of the Saint’s mouth next.

 

“Now I know what you might be thinking. These are some nasty buggers, right? Well, despite them eating the dreams of mortals, they also serve an important purpose. Without them, the rem sleep of humans could last over ten hours. CRICKY that’s a lot of hours. This is why it’s important to throw these little cuddle creatures back if you see them trapped on land. That much rem sleep could lead to negative health consequences.” He gestured to the camera and a golden assortment of words appeared, listing off the negative effects of too much rem sleep.

 

“Wow, I probably would have ignored that if I saw it.” One woman in the crowd said.

 

“With a name like that, I would have stepped on it.” A man responded.

 

The crowd exchanging idle chatter, having learned a lot from the brief episode of heaven’s hottest show. The angel wiped their eyes, their emotions finally spilling out. John watched as the angel mouthed a small prayer before turning to view the mortal once more.

 

“You see why he is important to the afterlife? Without him, the people here wouldn’t know how to interact with the creatures they encounter. We tried everything before he arrived. Pamphlets, lectures, puppet shows and even interpretive dance, and yet nothing held their attention. Then along came Saint Irwin and suddenly everyone was interested. He just made everyone care about the creatures.”

“He is greatly missed at home. You don’t get many iconic people like him. I’m glad to see he’s doing well.” John said, only to give the counter a small tap. “So, am I allowed into heaven?”

 

“One moment” The angel held up a finger as the preview for the next episode began.

 

“Follow the crocodile hunter Saint Irwin as he takes a trip down to purgatory to give us information on the face stealers. Are they as dangerous as the reports suggest? Find out on the next episode of Saint Irwin, the crocodile hunter.” When the voice over finished, everyone but the angel couldn’t believe what they had just heard. Face stealers? Surely something like that was dangerous.

 

“That episodes a repeat. Turns out Face stealers are just the reflections of people. They are created whenever someone looks in a mirror or anything reflective, for that matter. They aren’t dangerous, they just survive off the memories of that person and when that person is finally forgotten, they painlessly disappear. Don’t look so scared, everyone, they don’t harm the people in purgatory. At worst, they might give them a fright if they see their own face.”

 

Despite the angels’ words, everyone continued to murmur between one another, excited to get into heaven just so they could see the next episode. The angel looked John over before opening the gates.

 

“Where’s my room?” John was bouncing on his heels, ready to run as soon as they gave him the information he needed.

 

“Your room is five hundred and fifty in the northern section. Just ask an angel when you get in and they will show you the way. If you can get to your room in ten minutes, you should catch the start of the Face stealers episode. It’s on channel 777.”

 

“Right, thank you!” With that, John rushed to his room, not wanting to miss a single moment of such exciting television.
