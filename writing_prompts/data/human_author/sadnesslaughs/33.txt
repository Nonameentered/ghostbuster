“This city is dark. Darker than the deepest pits of my soul. I’m their only protector. Without me, they would be lost. I am their Shepard and they are my flock.” Silverwolf held up his hands in grandiose fashion, the beaming golden lights of the city sparkling underneath him. Just in this moment, the vigilante felt powerful, as if he had the entire world at his feet. The small ant like blobs of people were moving along the streets, not even noticing that they were under the watchful eye of the vigilante. He took in a breath, absorbing all that fresh air, only to nearly fall off the side of the rooftop as a shout came from behind him.

 

“EVERYONE GETS FIFTHTEEN MINUTES, HURRY UP.” Madfire said, the redheaded heroine tapping her watch, trying to speed up the line. She had already been waiting two hours and now that she could finally see that beautiful rooftop edge, she was getting excited, unable to contain herself much longer.

 

“Shut up. Can’t you see how deep and gritty I am? I deserve an extra few minutes, after all. I am the one that protects these streets, unlike you posers.”

 

“Posers? I’ll have you know I came here three times yesterday; do you call that poser behavior?” Flying Mack said, the Papier mâché winged hero awkwardly tucking in his elbows, trying not to scrap the frail material against the walls of the fire escape he was waiting in. He was just behind Madfire and couldn’t even see the view yet.

 

“Only three? You fool, I simply return to the line whenever I have a spare moment. I only take breaks for the restroom and lunch. I even save time by sleeping in the line.” Silverwolf responded, still admiring the sparkling city below, feeling as though he could take down any criminal tonight.

 

“So what? It’s not about how many times you come here, it’s about the way you eat in the view. You talk too much. You need a deep brooding stare, a long distant look followed by a few raindrops if you’re lucky. Then, after ten minutes, you finally speak and unleash your innermost thoughts on the city.” Madfire said.

 

“Raindrops? I can’t go out in the rain, it ruins my wings. Do you know how long it takes to make these? Not to mention I have to wait until my little cousin is back from school so he can help me.” Flying Mack said, his hand reaching back to grip the edge of his wings, making sure they were still holding together.

 

“Your cousin? You don’t even make them yourself? What are you, some sort of loser?” Madfire laughed. 

“Cousin? I meant my sidekick Crafty Boy. Only he possesses the power to wield the long sticking glue and handle the sacred left handed scissors.” Flying Mack placed a hand over his face for dramatic effect, although no one was looking his way.

 

“Shush you two. I am admiring the view. I am the dark shepherd, the one that will save my innocent flock from the slaughter. I am the day to their night, I am the sun to their screen, I am the-“

 

“THAT DOES IT. ‘I’M’ COMING OVER THERE.” Madfire moved her way over to the edge of the rooftop, making it a slightly tight squeeze as they both were now perched on its edge.

 

“You can’t. The world can only handle one dazzling vigilante. You wait your turn.”

 

“I waited my turn. That’s the problem, idiot. You took too long. There’s a reason we have the line and schedule. Didn’t you read the rules on the forum? Everyone gets fifthteen minutes, then they have to go back to the front.”

 

“But why should I only get fifthteen minutes? Have you seen the pathetic excuses for vigilantes? Take yourself, for instance. A red suit with green patches. Have you ever heard of color coordinating?”

 

“I’ll coordinate my fist with your stupid face.”

 

Suddenly the pair were wrestling each other on the perch, the two dangerously close to rolling over the edge. Neither knew how to throw a proper punch, so the battle had turned into a messy battle of limp wrists and failed slaps. As they rolled back and forth, they neared the edge a little too closely, both stopping and holding a breath as they felt the windy midnight breeze hit them.

 

“Heh, maybe we should discuss this somewhere that isn’t dangerous?” Madfire suggested.

 

“Yes, that might be a good idea.”

 

The two were about to release one another and stand up, only to get startled by the blank stare of Flying Mack, who had crept closer during the fight. The winged vigilante standing over them, silently watching the battle. As he was spotted, the two let out a scream. Silverwolf grabbed his shirt and pulled him, causing the three to tumble off the roof.

 

“AHHHH, USE YOUR WINGS TO SAVE US.” Madfire shouted as the three fell towards the city they all so dearly admired.

 

“I can’t. They don’t work, unless I just need to believe in them?” Flying Mack closed his eyes, believing in the power of his sidekick. The wings fluttered, only problem was, they weren’t fluttering because of powers, they were fluttering because they had broken off his back and were now carelessly falling towards the city with the group.
“I hate you all.” Silverwolf said, wanting to get one last word in before his death. As the three neared their grim demise, they felt themselves float. It was as if gravity had just stopped. They all looked around at one another, seeing a pink orb circling their bodies. The orb holding them still before lowering them to the ground safely. When their feet hit the ground, the pink orb vanished.

 

“Really? This is what the so-called vigilantes spend their days doing? Do you know how hard you make it for us heroes? I should be out fighting villains, not babysitting a rooftop. How do so many of you fall off the edge? Someone really should install a guardrail or something.” Lifesaver crossed her arms, looking at the three vigilantes. Even behind a pink mask it was obvious her face with twisted into a scowl. For a hero to have to babysit a bunch of people wanting to play dress up, it was rather degrading. She just hoped her shift would be over soon.

 

“Hard for heroes? Heh, it’s not as hard as it is for us. We are born from the grime of the Earth, the ones that have seen how mean the streets can be. We give our blood, sweat and mostly tears for this city and do the things you so-called heroes won’t do.” Silverwolf said, not too pleased with the hero’s tone.

 

“Oh, please. Have any of you even fought a villain?”

 

“I once told a guy not to cut in line? Does that count?” Flying Mack asked.

 

Lifesaver just rested a hand on her cheek. The vigilantes just kept getting worse. At least some others attempted to stop crimes. These lot were just the definition of posers. “No, I don’t believe that counts. Look, can you at least follow the rules if you’re going to go up there?”

“We don’t play by the rules, that’s what makes us-“ Silverwolf tried to speak, only to shut up when Lifesaver placed a finger in front of her mouth.

 

“You, be quiet. I’m sick of hearing you speak. You sound like all those low tier villains.”

 

“Well, we tried. But he kept hogging the position, so we got into a fight. Look, we are trying to help. We just aren’t exactly very super.” Madfire admitted, lowering her head in shame. Flying Mack soon followed, lowering his head as well. Silverwolf kept his head high, still feeling he did nothing wrong.

 

“If you really want to help, we have some openings in the hero helpline department. It’s just basic phone answering stuff, but it helps us determine where crimes are happening. It’s not glamorous, but who knows, maybe you can learn how to be a hero and make some money?”

 

“I’m not a hero, I’m a moody-“

“I TOLD YOU TO BE QUIET.” Lifesaver finally snapped, her words enough to make Silverwolf lower his head. “Look, hero, vigilante, dog walker, I don’t care what you call yourself. I’m offering you honest work. You can still do this on the side.”

 

Lifesaver opened a pocket on her suit, pulling out a few folded up pieces of paper. She handed them out to the group before looking up at the roof, seeing a man with a pair of cheap Halloween demon wings. “Just think about it, ok? Now can you move? I think this guy might believe those wings are real.”

 

The three got out of the way, heading to a quiet street corner to read over the job offer. “I guess it pays ok. Maybe I can learn something.” Madfire said.

 

“It would be nice to afford some better glue. The cheap stuff always smells really weird.”

 

“Why are you smelling it?”

 

“To test its quality. That’s not important. What’s important is I need money, so I’m taking the job. What about you?” Flying Mack asked, turning to Silverwolf.

“The Silverwolf requires funds since his parents kicked him out for breaking holes in the wall to build a secret lair. I guess I will offer my experience. They would be foolish to not hire me.”

 

“Whatever you say.” Madfire said, giving the two a wave before they all went on their way, leaving the lovely rooftop view they loved behind.
