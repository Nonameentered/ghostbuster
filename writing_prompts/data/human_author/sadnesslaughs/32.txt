“Will it hurt? Anything I should expect?” I fiddled with the tube poking out of my right hand, finding relief in the smooth texture as I tried to think about anything other than the procedure. Death wasn’t an easy thing to face, especially not when it was so close. The doctors had offered valium to help ease the process, but I wanted to have a clear head for my last moments, not wanting to make any mistakes when I gave my last words.

 

“You won’t feel a thing. Think of it like going to sleep and just never waking up. I’m sorry, I wish I had a better way to describe it. I promise, it won’t cause you any discomfort. Before we start, I should double check. Are you certain about this? Have you gotten your affairs in order, told your loved ones?” The doctor paused after he said that, staring over at the bed beside me. “Did you tell her?”

 

“Of course not. She wouldn’t let me if I did. She doesn’t deserve to be in pain, least I can do is return the favor for the life she gave me. Do you mind not telling her until she recovers a little? I’m worried about how she will take the news.”

 

“Sure, I think it will be in her best interest if we give her some time to recover before telling her. Are-“ The doctor went to speak, only to close his mouth, perhaps not feeling it was his place to question my decision. After all, I had passed all the pre-checks to become an eligible donor. I had undertaken a mental evaluation and multiple interviews to get to this point. The doctor had no right to refuse it.

 

“I’m sure. I know she wouldn’t want this, but how much longer was I meant to sit around and pray that she got better? Every day, she just gets worse. She barely recognizes me when I visit. She will feel better after this, right?”

 

“Most of the other patients have lived healthy and full lives after the procedure. If you have a few healthy remaining years in you, she should inherit those. Once those are up, the illness will return. Still, there is no guarantee that it will last forever. It won’t make her live until she’s 150 or anything so severe, it will simply give her healthy years. Of course, this doesn’t mean she won’t be immune to catching a new disease or injury. Old age is always a factor as well.”

 

“But she will recover from this?”

 

“It’s around an 80% chance. There are cases of the person’s body rejecting the life but, in your case, I doubt that will be an issue. Just to clarify, you understand what the procedure is? I know the nurse asked, but we have to follow protocol before proceeding.” 

“It’s a life transfer. I’m sure you have a better name for it, but that’s pretty much what it is. I’ll die and she will get my healthy years. Is that an alright answer?”

 

“It is. Are you ready?”

 

“Um, can you push the beds a little closer first? I want to hold her hand during it.”

 

“Of course.”

 

The doctor gripped the metal rails of the bed, pushing me closer to her side. I reached out with my left hand, grabbing her hand to hold, turning my face to the side, wanting to get one last look at her. “I think I’m ready. Tell her I love her when she wakes up. Tell her I want her to have a good life, like the one she gave me.”

 

“I will. You might feel a small sting at first, but it will be peaceful after that. Just relax.”

 

The sting made me wince, sending a burning sensation throughout my palm. I gripped her hand tighter as I felt the sensation climb up my arm, feeling as though I was about to burst before suddenly it subsided. I kept my gaze on her, trying to steady my breathes as I gave her a last smile.

 

“Love you, mom. I’ll miss you.”
