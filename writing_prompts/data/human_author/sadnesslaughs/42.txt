Alex finished placing his flowers by the grave, continuing the long walk through the field of resting corpses. He always watched his step, not wanting to damage the assortment of trinkets and pictures left by the other grieving visitors. The early morning visits, while lonely, were a necessity. If he didn’t want to be late for school, he needed to visit early, having to pull himself out of bed an hour before his parents would wake.

 

He wished they would join him on his walks. They used to come with him every day when he visited, but lately; they were struggling to find the energy to get out of bed. The monotony of life wore people down, especially those still in shock over the loss of a loved one. That’s why Alex didn’t blame them. He was going on behalf of them all. He knew his parents would one day join him again on the walks when they were feeling better, but for now, he would walk alone.

 

The crisp winter air made the boy shiver, his worn out yellow jacket being tightly held as he breathed out cloudy breaths. He made a mental note to bring mittens next time or even an extra jacket, anything that could help shield him from the morning chill. As he left the first lot of graves, he turned to face them, wanting to take one last look at his sister’s grave. As he turned around, a pale girl standing a foot shorter than him was waiting behind him.

 

She looked up at him, not uttering a word. Her long, ragged black hair hanging past her shoulders. Alex jumped, feeling an eerie chill for a second before he was enveloped in a soothing warmth, one that made the jacket feel unnecessary.

 

“Are you visiting someone too?” Alex asked, only to receive no response.

 

The girl reached for his hand, getting a tight grip on it before she pulled him along, leading him further into the graveyard. Alex stood his ground for a second, only to feel his body getting dragged as she forced him to walk with her. The little girl being far stronger than he ever would have expected. As the pair walked through the dreary graveyard, Alex stared at her. Who was she? 

 

“I’m here visiting my little sister.” Alex tried again to make conversation, only for the girl to ignore him. The only response she gave was peering up at him when he mentioned his sister. Alex almost would have mistaken the strange girl for his sister, if not for the differences in their hair.

The walk was uncomfortable, the girl not disturbed by the unevenness of the dirt or the slippery morning dew covered grass. Instead, she moved with a grace that made her look as if she was walking on air. She did sometimes look back, making sure she hadn’t lost Alex before turning forward again. After a few minutes, the girl stopped, pointing to a grave.

 

“Oh, is this your loved one?” Alex awkwardly stood by her side, still holding her hand as she pointed out the grave. It wasn’t in great condition. Dried mud lathering the headpiece with only an empty, withered basket, being the remnants of a floral arrangement that was left there long ago.

 

Alex pulled his hand free, much to the despair of the girl who desperately tried to grab hold of him once more. Before she could, Alex lowered himself to the grave, wiping his sleeve on the muddied headpiece, wiping off as much of it as he could. “Here lies Erica Reni, our beautiful daughter and our greatest gift. We will always love you, dear. 1904-1911.” Turning to the girl once more, he could see her trying to hold back tears, pointing to the last name.

 

“I’m sorry. I don’t think I know who that is.”

 

The girl pointed to herself, then back to the grave. She did this a few times until Alex understood what she was trying to say.

 

“This is your grave?” He should have been scared, but he just felt sorry for the girl. He glanced over the name once more, only to shake his head. “I really don’t know anyone with that last name, Reni. I’m sorry, but your parents might have passed away too. It was a long time ago. Maybe you can find them?”

 

She looked at the gates of the graveyard, the rising sun looming in the distance, sending a flutter of golden light through the air. She kept her gaze on it before she shook her head, reaching for Alex’s hand again. Alex took her hand, getting to his feet before he began leading her back to his little sister’s grave.

 

When they were back at his sister’s grave, he took a single yellow pansy from the flowers he had brought. “This is my sister. Maybe you can find her, and she can help you on the other side? I’m not sure how it works, but she’s a very sweet girl.” Alex tried to swallow the knot in his throat, not wanting to cry in front of Erica. “And I miss her a lot.” Erica patted his shoulder as they stood by the grave, only for the girl to drag him towards the gates of the graveyard.

At first, he couldn’t tell what she was following, Alex being dragged across graves and nearly through trees. The boy having to do his best to avoid getting tripped over. Eventually he spotted what she was following, seeing a small black and white butterfly fluttering through the air, leading the two towards the gates. When the butterfly reached the gates, it stopped, hovering in place, waiting for the girl.

 

“Is that her?” 

 

Erica gave a nod, about to release his hand, only for Alex to grip hers tighter before she could.

 

“Please tell her we love her. Tell her we all miss her dearly. Mom and dad aren’t ignoring her, they have just been really sad.” Finally, Alex broke down, all those emotions he had held back collapsing. Erica patted his back once more, but that only made him cry more. He sobbed until the butterfly landed on his nose. The small butterfly waving its wings, drawing his attention to it. He held his finger out, allowing the butterfly to move onto it.

 

He spent a minute just looking at it before sucking back his tears. “I miss you. I hope I get to see you again someday.” He rested his forehead as close to the butterfly as he could before letting it fly off. It moved to the gate again and waited for Erica. Erica smiled at Alex before heading through the gates. When she passed through, the butterfly followed, both of them ascending into the air, following the rising sun. Just for a split second, he was certain he could see his sister, but that split second was interrupted by the glare of the sun, which forced him to look away.

 

Alex waited for a moment, making sure neither of them returned to the spot. Once he was certain they had safely gone, he went to Erica’s grave and placed the pansy down. “I’ll come and clean your grave tomorrow, promise.” After that, he returned home, unsure whether to tell his parents about what he saw.
