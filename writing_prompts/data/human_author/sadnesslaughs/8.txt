Having an apprentice was a bit like adopting a puppy. It was a fresh rush of life that never ceased to amaze you. Sure, sometimes they would set your carpet on fire, but other times they would impress you with their ability to see the world in a way that you never thought possible. While Valery might have seemed rather ordinary among magic users, I couldn’t help but respect her drive, even if she refused to learn nothing other than fireball related magic.

 

“Ok and for my next trick, fireball… but pink!” She waved her hands in a circular motion before pushing her palms forward, sending a pink burst of fire towards me. I waved my hand dismissively, extinguishing the flame before it could even do as little as burn one of my perfectly groomed white beard hairs.

 

“Is your next trick just another colored fireball? This is the fifth one you have thrown at me. At this point, you have nearly made a fireball rainbow. Wouldn’t you like to learn how to summon a familiar or perhaps extinguish flames with a sway of your hand?”

 

“Hmmm, can a familiar shoot fireballs?”

 

“Well, not exactly, but some can breathe fire?”

 

“Not interested then.” Somehow, Valery kept that same goofy smile, not even understanding the ridiculousness of her obsession. It was getting harder to teach her. I would have loved to recommend her to a mage college, but how could I ever do that if she only knew variations of one spell?

 

“Right, are you sure? How about explosion magic? It’s like a fireball, but bigger?”

 

“What sort of weirdo learns how to make explosions?”

 

“That’s really not any weirder than your situation.” I sighed, readying my hand for another fireball. “Alright, throw another one at me.”

 

She gave a small hop of joy, her pink hood swinging as she made a dramatic pose, pointing a finger at me. She must have thought she looked so cool and she might have, if not for the fact her hood had thrown itself over her face, covering her eyes. There was no spark after she snapped her fingers, leaving me standing there confused. Was she out of magic?
I waited for her to say something, before feeling a heat in front of me. My groomed beard sizzling as the hairs burnt away, threatening to hit my chin. I quickly finished my wave, sending the fire away. I clutched my shortened beard, mourning the loss of three hundred years of growth, only to look back up and see her spin around, clapping her hands.

 

“Invisible fireball! My super attack.”

 

“An invisible fireball? You made an invisible fireball. How did you make an invisible fireball? You shouldn’t be able to hide an element like that. Someone of your skill level especially shouldn’t be capable of that.”

 

“Huh? Oh, it was easy. I just mixed an invisibility spell with some of my fireball formula’s. It’s not that hard. I could probably teach you if you wanted to know.”

 

I couldn’t say anything. I just stared at her in disbelief. Sure, I had heard of great mages who had only ever studied one element of magic. We had great fire mages, great water mages, but I had never heard of a great mage who only knew fireball related magic. Was she a prodigy or just someone so stubborn that she forced magic to bend to her wills?

 

“Master? Are you ok? You kind of zoned out there? Wait, I know. How about a healing fireball?” She pressed her finger to my chin, causing me to let out a high-pitched scream as she blasted my face with a fireball.

 

I didn’t see the flame, only feeling an intense burn as it tossed me to the ground. I rolled around a little before realizing I felt no pain at all. In fact, I felt good, like she had blasted me with a hot massage. I stood up, dusting off my silver lined robe, unsure how to process what she had just done. Even my burnt beard had slightly healed. Still far shorter, but at least it didn’t have any burn markings.

 

“Why would you shoot a fireball at me with no warning like that? What if you didn’t heal me and blasted my head off?”

 

“Oh, I just assumed you would have been able to deflect it if I messed up. Good thing I didn’t, right?” She laughed in my face, not even realizing how dangerous that was, and yet I found it hard to stay mad at her. She had thrown my knowledge of magic on its head and that outweighed her current airheaded nature.

“Yes, very good thing you didn’t. So, you have somehow bent a spell to perform new purposes. Even a formula change shouldn’t be able to achieve that. Either you’re incredibly gifted or you can perform magic in a way that others can’t. Perhaps you have accidentally stumbled upon one of the greatest magic discoveries in years.”

 

“Aww, thank you. I am incredibly gifted, right? That’s why you picked me out of all the apprentices.”

 

“Yes, that’s the reason. Because you were so unique.” I didn’t have the heart to tell her she was the last one left. Most masters saw how her application only said fireball with a smiley face next to it and quickly moved onto other choices. But I was the youngest of the masters at the age of only three hundred and fifty, so I got stuck with the runt of the magic litter.

 

“So, did I pass the entrance exam? Do you think I could study at one of those fancy mage colleges now? You can recommend me, can’t you? Aren’t you like an enormous deal in one of them?”

 

“I was a big deal. Not so much anymore. I don’t know what to say. You didn’t pass the exam, but you might have still technically passed by showing off that much talent. Regardless, I still can’t recommend you to a magic college, not with your current skill set. Even if you have an ability others don’t, you won’t pass any of their tests. As amazing as your fireballs are, they can’t cushion someone’s fall or fire lightning bolts. Those are all basic abilities for a mage.”

 

Valery considered my words, stroking her chin in a similar fashion to how I do when I’m deep in thought. I couldn’t tell if she was mocking me or had merely just picked up my habit from our time together. After a lot of tense chin stroking, she gave me a smile.

 

“What if I just made a fireball that could do all of that?”

 

“Well, technically, if you could do that, you would pass. But how would you make a fireball that can shoot water? Or something like that.”

 

“I have no idea, but I’ll figure it out.”

 

It was bizarre. If anyone else had said that to me, I would have laughed in their face, but after her display, I couldn’t help but believe her.

“Alright, that will be your first task, then. Create a fireball that can shoot water. If you can do that, I’ll talk more about your enrollment.”

 

“But I need someone to show me what water magic looks like.”

 

I opened my palm, creating a small puddle in my hand. I was never great at water magic, unable to summon water like the others, instead I sucked the sweat from my body and pooled it in a location. It was gross and rather unpleasant to do, but it was how I passed my water exams in college, so it was the only way I knew how.

“Here, it’s a pretty simple looking magic, you just harness-“

 

“Um, no offence, master. But do you know anyone else? I don’t really want to throw sweaty fireballs at people.”

 

“I… I see.” I couldn’t help but feel a little offended. My apprentice was asking for a replacement. Sure, it might have only been for water magic, but it still hurt.

 

“You’re still a great mage, but it’s just your water magic is really weird, and it makes you look like a freak.”

 

And just like that, she had thrusted the emotional fireball knife through my heart. I said nothing, letting myself recover a little from the words, only feeling the need to speak when I saw her opening her mouth again.

 

“Yes, yes. I will find you someone else. Just please stop insulting me. I may be three hundred and fifty, but my feelings still get hurt.”

 

“Oh, want a healing fireball?’

 

“I’m fine. Just go to your room and study. I’ll make the preparations and please stop mentioning my water magic. Ok?”

 

“Ok, I won’t mention your weird sweat magic.” And with that, Valery left me to grumble alone in my workshop. Mumbling small insults to myself as I wrote out a letter.

 

“Calls my magic weird and yet she can’t even summon a crow to send a letter. Who does she think she is? I bet other masters don’t get disrespected like this.” I summoned my familiar, who appeared with his head looking down, the crow sharing my hurt feelings. I gave him a few pats, glad that someone at least emphasized with me. Sure, he was just a figment of my soul, but it was the most sympathy I had gotten all day. I gave him the letter and spoke the name. “Penelope Madiz.”

 

The crow nodded and looked for a window. When it found none in my workshop, it hopped its way up the stairs, purposely avoiding Valery when she called out to it, holding a small grudge before it flew off to find Penelope. With the letter sent, all I could do was wait. I picked up a book on water magic, reading over the pages, trying to learn the magic that had eluded me for centuries.
