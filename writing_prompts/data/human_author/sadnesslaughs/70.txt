[Part 2 of 2]

“Yes, I’m here. I have a brief tour set up for you first, though. I need you to understand the brilliance of my ship before I meet you. You might be the only person who can appreciate it.” Her voice flowed through the speakers with a crispness that would make a music lover weep.

 

“I’m sure others will appreciate it. Your works of art are always the talk of the galaxy.”

 

“Yes, that puts us in a lot of danger.” Her voice dropped a little as she said that, not enjoying the attention her work brought. 

 

As Henderson followed the lights, a small robotic hand extended from the wall, offering him a glass of red wine. Henderson rarely drank during work hours, but this was a special occasion. “A wine? How nice. What are you calling this ship, Elizabeth?”

 

“The Masterpiece. I know it’s tacky, but it’s my greatest work. I feel like calling it anything less would be insulting.” Around Henderson, the doors of the ship flung open with a pace unmatched by any other spacecraft. The ship’s technology far beyond others in terms of responsiveness.

 

The first stop on the tour was the kitchen area. It was simple enough, having a small dining hall that could fit around thirty soldiers at a time and a place to grow fresh fruit and vegetables. Not to mention a food processor that could turn those same fresh ingredients into meat substitutes using a few chemicals.

 

Elizabeth allowed Henderson some time to explore the room before motioning him to the next with the floor lights. The next room he came across was the engine room. The engine room filled with large cylinder containers, each acting as a coolant for the big, triangle shaped engine floating in the middle of the room.

“It looks stunning, although I fear I don’t know anything about engines. Only the basics.”

 

“Well, I won’t confuse you with any detailed definitions. Just know that we have increased our light travel by thirty percent and with the engine floating in a Polinthium stasis, we have a reduced chance of the engine being knocked or shaken during an attack. If we are bumped, the engine should be able to move with the impact.”

 

‘Thirty percent? That would make us the fastest in the galaxy, would it not?”

 

“No one should be able to build a ship like this for at the very least another ten years. Five if someone can explore the ship behind our backs. If we keep this as secretive as possible, we should be able to maintain our peace here.” Her voice brimming with pride as she spoke, before continuing the tour.

 

They passed the escape pods, weaponry and even the crew quarters before arriving at the captains’ quarters/ the cockpit. Unlike most ships, the captains’ quarters weren’t away from the cockpit, instead only a door separated them. Something that Henderson felt uncomfortable with.

 

“Why is my room attached to the cockpit?” He took a seat on the leather chair, staring up at the improved monitors in the cockpit. Their design was sleek, with silver tracings along their borders. “Finally, new monitors. It’s been too long.”

 

“Knew you would like the monitors. With the cockpit design, I found its better to have the captain as close to command as possible. A communicator can go down in a battle and if you're urgently needed, this is the best option. I understand it may feel strange, but I assure you, I took your privacy into consideration. Want to see your room?”

 

“Sure.” Pulling on the handle to his room, a sudden burst of light greeted him. The green light hitting his eye, confirming his identity. It opened, revealing a rather fancy room. The walls decorated in replicas of his medals, with some of his real medals even being mixed into the display. On the table in the room’s corner was a photo frame. One with Henderson and Elizabeth standing before the first ship she created. The S.S Pipsqueak. “Can’t believe the pipsqueak got retired last year. I loved that little ship. Are you going to show yourself?” He smiled, reminiscing about the photo. His gaze falling on the brown-haired woman beside him. They looked so happy in that photo.

 

“I guess now is the best time for that.” The wall shifted, shaking as it peeled open, revealing a sterile white room. Inside the room sat a cryo chamber with the name Elizabeth Brown on the front. Cords scattered the floor by the cyro chambers bottom, leading into the walls of the ship.

“Elizabeth?” Henderson dragged his hand against the glass, staring at Elizabeth. His friend frozen, with a look of content. Despite her state, she appeared composed, even keeping her glasses perfectly aligned while her body was frozen stiff. “What have you done?”

 

“A Spacecraft can only advance so far without artificial intelligence. I tried to train an A.I but none were developing quick enough. This was the easiest solution. I have become the A.I of this ship. Don’t worry, I don’t plan for this to be permanent. When I have the technology to create a better A.I, I will leave the chamber. For now, you can consider me your newest crewmate.”

 

“But this is insane. What will happen if someone finds out about this? People will already target this ship. I don’t want to take it out if there’s a risk of you getting killed when it’s attacked.”

 

“I am aware of the risk, and I trust you. If you are leading the ship, we shouldn’t have a problem. This is our best shot at securing peace for our colony. Don’t worry, I can still conduct ship repairs and builds in this form. I will just have to take control of the machinery in my office.”

 

“Are you positive about this? How will I tell the others?”

 

“You won’t. This will stay between us. I put my chamber in your room for that very reason. It’s best we don’t let others know that about this secret. I understand it’s a shock, but I’m doing this for us. I promise I’ll be out of this chamber in no time. For now, considering me your crewmate, like back in the olden days.”

 

Henderson found it hard to share her excitement. Only able to stare at the cold chamber she was trapped inside of. He wanted to free her, but the maestro knew best. “Very well. I’ll trust you on this. Are you ready for me to show the rest of the crew the ship?”

 

“Sure, just let me grant their authorization.” Henderson heard a small click as the ramp opened. Henderson stepped out of the room, hearing the walls ramble shut behind him. He gave it a quick glance before heading to address his soldiers.
