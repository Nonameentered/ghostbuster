“Ah yes, remind me how this ‘complex’ society runs.” Mother dragon rolled her eyes, willing to indulge in her child’s fantasies for just a tad longer. The young dragon jumped from his seat, a small puff of smoke leaving his nostrils as he picked up one of his painted miniatures.

 

“Well, my human, Todd, is an accountant. He is kind of like the human equivalent of a dragon. He sits atop a hoard of other people’s money!” Blasix said, the young dragon trying to convince his mother of his cool hobby.

 

“Humans. Why would anyone want to play as something so gross? Still, you have my attention. What does he do with this wealth? Does he use it to attract prey into his cave, only to chew them up when they get close?”

 

“No! He distributes the funds to pay for people’s utilities or even helps manage their taxes. You see taxes are an important system in the human realm that help- “

 

“Ugh, stop. Please. Who gives away a hoard? Your father and I raised you to be responsible with your hoard, and now you’re just throwing away gold in a fantasy realm?” She said, snatching the miniature from her sons’ claws.

 

Todd had a plain face, with squared glasses. The miniature had a small rescinding hairline that Blasix had carefully woven into his backstory. Claiming it resulted from four rather harrowing divorces. He still fondly remembered the custody hearing session his group did as part of his character’s backstory. Wow, he had some bad rolls in that session! That’s why his character was on the road with the others. They were all seeking an escape from the modernity of life.

 

His mother only scoffed at the ordinary-looking miniature, twisting it a few times to attempt to see the appeal of it. To her, it looked like some weird weak bug, something that couldn’t compare to the mighty power of a dragon. At least he wasn’t out burning things like some other children. Even if she didn’t like his hobby, it was better than that.

 

“Technically, it’s not a hoard. Humans don’t use gold to trade, well, at least not in the expansion pack we are running. We actually use a thing called money.” Avilis said, awkwardly chiming in to help her friend explain the game.

 “What is this money made of? They must have found something quite amazing if it can outshine the value of gold.”

“Well, in this current location they use linen or cotton, I think? Some other locations use plastic or polymer. My character comes from a place called Australia. It’s like a mystical word filled with dangerous beasts and bugs. They use the polymer type! Want to hear my backstory and how my character gains a poison resistance from her homeland?”

 

“Avilis, that’s lovely, dear, but I just don’t see the appeal. What good is this fake money when you could have gold? Sure, it may be more pleasant to sit on a pile of linen or cotton, but it just doesn’t have that feel of power like gold.”

 

“It’s not about that, it’s about spending the hoard to get other items.” Blasix said, nearly causing his mother to faint.

 

“S-s-spend the hoard? ARE YOU INSANE? You never get rid of your hoard unless you love another dragon very much, then maybe you will merge your hoard. But you never spend a hoard. You accumulate it. Oh, my sweet child. Do I have to limit your time playing this game?”

 

“No, it’s just a game, mom. I know not to waste my hoard and all of that. It’s just how you play the game. I promise.”

 

“Is that true? What do you do when someone comes for your hoard, then?” The mother dragon said, questioning her son.

 

“You stomp them and add their belongings to your hoard.” He said, stomping his foot for extra effect.

 

“Good, good. Ok, maybe you can distinguish reality from fiction. I just don’t see the appeal. What do these humans do all day?”

 

“Most of them work jobs. My human used to run an ice-cream shop, only for it to fail due to him being unable to pay the bills. He was trying to manage a chronic knee injury while paying for the rent of his store. Unfortunately, my starting location doesn’t help pay medical bills, so he was forced to shut down the shop. Now he travels with the others, hoping to afford his surgery.” Hulta explained, his miniature having a little paper cast around its knee.

 

“And… that’s fun for you? That sounds horrible to me. So, he just sits in a shop all day? That’s the life of a human? No animal should have to go through that sort of torment, its unethical.”

 

“I know it seems unethical to us, mom, but that’s just how humans live.” Blasix said, backing up his friend.

“Well, he did until they shut his store down. Now he can’t even afford to sit in a shop all day. It’s the depressing aspects that really help build the lore of the game. It’s just nice to know such an awful world couldn’t really exist.” Hulta said with a smile.

 

“I guess. I just think about the sort of fun for me and my friends used to have. It was none of this sitting around. We used to fly around and discover things. Not sit and play humans. Maybe times are just changing. It’s not all bad. You are all good kids and much better behaved than I was.” The mother dragon gave a smile. Maybe it wasn’t too bad of a hobby.

 

“Would you like to play with us sometime? I have a character build you can use. Her name is Tricia, and she spent five years studying at university only to discover her diploma had no value since its nearly impossible to get employed in her field. Now she works at a retail shop and wonders if she will ever repay her debt. It’s a good build, if I say so myself.” Avilis said as her friends nodded in recognition of the well-crafted character.

 

“I’ll pass. That sounds too unrealistic to me. A world where the wise can’t work. I can’t believe such nonsense. Even If I don’t mind you playing this, it doesn’t change the fact that it’s a school night. Fly along little ones, your parents must be worried. I’ll leave your game out and you can play it after you finish your homework tomorrow.”

 

“Yes, mam.” Avilis and Hulta said. The two getting up and heading to the door. They said their quick goodbyes to Blasix before flying home, talking to each other about their campaign along the way.

 

“Thank you for being understanding, mom. I love you.”

 

“I love you too, my little fire starter. Come on, go get some sleep. You can play tomorrow.”

 

“Thanks Mom.”

 

The mother dragon smiled as she watched her son go to his room. She was lucky to have such an amazing child, even if she found his game dumb.
