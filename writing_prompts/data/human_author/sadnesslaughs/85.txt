“I’m sorry friend, I don’t believe there’s anything I can offer you. You should move on, find a new home.” Athima felt the wet nose of his companion nudge against his broken legs. He pitied the animal; how foolish it was to be loyal to a broken god like him. If only it had the same sense as his other worshippers and left when it watched him fall.

 

“I don’t think I’ll ever understand you, Hela. You’re the one feeding me now. What could you possibly have to gain out of this?” Athima scratched under the dog’s chin, trying to wrap his head around the dog’s decision. He had performed miracles for others and yet the one that he fed his scraps to was the only one that stayed by his side, nursing him back to health as best they could. “Please, find some happiness for yourself, little one. I don’t want you to waste your life at my side.”

 

Hela only tilted her head at his request, floppy ears hanging downward as she stared up at him before slowly dropping her head onto his lap, waiting for more pats. Athima granted the request, running his fingers through the mud-covered dark fur. “It once was so lively here. Families used to sing and dance through the halls. Now it’s so eerily silent. I hope everyone is doing fine. I know they abandoned me, but I wish for their safety.”

 

Athima continued to stroke the dog’s fur, only for Hela to jump up from his lap, rushing to the decaying halls of the temple, letting out an orchestra of loud barks as she did. The walls echoed with barks, filling the room with the sound for a few moments before she stopped, turning back to Athima, wagging her tail.

 

“Thank you. I think I needed that.” Athima crawled towards her, dragging his body along the stone floor of the temple. When Hela spotted this, she moved to his side, offering her body. Athima wrapped an arm around her, allowing her to drag him across the temple floors. “Mind helping me to my room?”

The intelligence of Hela always amazed Athima. She had picked up on his commands so easily, understanding most of the commands he needed to get through his daily life. She pulled him towards his bedroom, resting his body against the edge of the bed. “Thank you, little one. I appreciate it.”

 

Athima grabbed the blankets hanging from his bed, pulling his body onto the soft mattress. Even while he did that, he could still feel the wet nose of Hela poking him, trying to help push him onto the bed. Even if her nudges didn’t help, he appreciated the attempt. When Athima got into bed, he reached down for Hela, pulling her up so she could join him.

 

“You’re a wonderful dog, Hela, and an even better friend. Thank you. If it weren’t for you, I believe I would have abandoned this realm long ago. You give me hope. Maybe one day you will even give me the strength to leave this temple and try my hand at being a mortal. That thought still scares me, but If I had you by my side, maybe I could do it.” He smiled at Hela, who only returned the gesture by licking his face.

 

“Now, let’s get some rest.” He patted Hela before releasing her, letting Hela roam to her favorite spot. Hela resting her head against his chest as she curled up beside him. “Goodnight, friend.”
