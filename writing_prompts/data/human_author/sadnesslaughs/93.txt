“Thank you for my magic sword.” The knight sang out, striding towards whatever stupid conflict he would get into next. I just stood there, biting my lip like a damned drunken fool, giving him a wave that tried to hide my bitterness. I was a genius, a man that could bend metal in ways that no other blacksmith could. No magic involved, just raw talent. Talent that was being called magic by stupid brick headed knights.

 

“Yes, yes, enjoy it. Hope you get stabbed with that sword, you idiot.” I made sure that last part was said under my breath, turning back to the store, looking over the dirtied workshop. All this mess for an ungrateful knight. Surely I deserved better than this? A top mind in blacksmithing was being referred to as magic by the masses. What cruel fate was that?

 

I leaned against the frail wooden booth I used for my storefront, careful to avoid giving myself a splinter from the cheap wood. “Step right up, buy one of my magical weapons.” I said, hating myself more with each word. I had given up on trying to convince people it was just an advancement in technology. People didn’t care about advancements in this day and age. It was all about magic, something that I had to use to sell my wares.

 

When a young man approached, I gave him my usual charming grin, one built from years of disappointment in dealing with stupid customers. “Ah, you must be looking for a fine weapon built from my magical flames. What can I get you?”

 

The man was draped in elegant blue silk, a silk that showed just how much above me he was. Obviously, the man was of noble birth, most likely having heard the peasants talk about my creations, wanting one of his own. I glanced at the sheath by his side, catching its handmade leather design between the odd stride he took.

“Sir, I don’t believe in magic. What I believe in is the power of human knowledge. I have been told you are the best in the land, and I wish to test that.”

 

His words caused my fake grin to falter, replaced by one of actual emotion. I reached over, grabbing him by his shoulders. “Exactly, you get it. I can’t believe of all people, a noble brat understands my skills. I’ll make you a fine sword, lad. What do you need? One to impress the noble ladies? One to slay a noble beast. What are you aiming for, kiddo?”

 

As I held his shoulders, he shifted, freeing his arm. His freed arm shot into the sky, halting the approaching guards, who were giving me dirty looks. “Sir, please remember that I am of noble birth. My parents pay a lot of the guards wages, and they don’t take kindly to their potential gold payments being haltered because of my injuries.”

 

“Oh, sorry. It’s just been years since someone saw the skill it takes to craft something. I could almost cry, honestly. I just got done selling a sword to a sucker of a knight. Told him it had the soul of some dead warrior; the idiot ate it up.”

 

“Sir Gerald, my guard? Is that the man you were referring to?” His cold, piercing brown eyes stayed on me as I gulped, waving my hands in his face.

 

“No, of course not. I get a lot of knights. I’m sure whoever is guarding you is perfectly good at identifying their weaponry. Meant no harm, sir.” I stared at the noble who didn’t speak, only watching me before shaking his head with a sigh.

 

“No harm done. Please mind your manners, though. I can ignore such words in private, but if someone were to overhear your comments, it would force me to tell a guard. I’m certain you know what the punishment is for insulting a noble family?”

 

“Getting my tongue chopped off? Is that the punishment?”

 

The noble smirked, appearing to enjoy my unease. “I won’t say, just try not to find out, ok? As for what I need the weapon for, well, it’s merely just a test.” He unsheathed his sword, revealing a beautiful blade, one that glistened with a shine of perfection that skilled hands could only achieve. “The blacksmith that made this said it was the best sword ever made. Can you improve upon it?”

 

“It is a good blade. Is it from the north? No one uses the slim design in this area.”

 

“It is. That’s observant of you. Well, can it be improved?” The noble awaited my answer as I felt the sword over, examining each curve of the metal, giving myself a better look at the weapon. 

“I could give it a clean and polish, but if I’m being honest, any changes would damage its integrity. The swords perfectly fine in its current position. To mess with the metal would only weaken the blade. I can make you an improved version of the sword, but altering your current blade wouldn’t achieve anything.” I hated turning away a good bag of coin, but I didn’t want to lie to a noble. Not with their guards on standby.

 

“I thought you were the best. Are you telling me that was a lie?” He leaned towards the counter, getting into my personal space, making me sweat.

 

“No, I’m great, better than any blacksmith. I just refuse to lie to you about the state of that blade. It would be an insult to the person who made it.”

 

The noble pressed a finger to his chin, pondering my words only to give me a smile. “Glad to hear it. I’ve assessed enough of your blades to know your talents. I just wanted to judge your morals.” He took his blade, slipping it back into its sheath. “Sorry for the deception, but our castle gets a lot of blacksmiths who consider themselves the best. I wanted to make sure you were worthy of the title. Would you like to work for me?”

“Huh? Work for you? In your home?”

 

“Home makes it sound small. Manor is a better word. Yes, my family requires the best wares, and you have them. I would pay top coin for anything you make and might even get you some credibility. What do you say?”

 

“The manor over the mountain? Falins manor?”

 

“That is correct? Are you willing to take on the role?”

 

“I’ll be there next week. Just need to pack up my things and finish a few orders.” I turned to the back of the store, making sure I had enough time to finish my remaining items.

 

“A man that finishes his commitments. I like that. I’ll see you next week then, sir. When you arrive, ask for Matthew, they should get the message to me. See you next week.” I gave the noble a wave, watching him wander off. Finally, I had my chance to prove my worth. Maybe I wouldn’t be considered magical any longer.
