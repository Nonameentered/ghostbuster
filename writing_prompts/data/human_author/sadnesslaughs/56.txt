[Part 2 of 2]

“GRANDDAD NO!” Chuck slipped his hands around his grandfather's arms, holding him back as he tried to stomp the now very alive statue.

 

“Wait! Don’t kill me. Your wonderful emotion brought me to life and, as is tradition, I will offer you the greatest gift I can provide. A burger, served by yours truly.” The statue gave a bow before honking its nose a few times.

 

Bill leaned towards Chuck, whispering into his ear. “If he even looks at the door, go for his ankles. Give him the old Achilles shave, if you know what I mean.” Chuck didn’t know what he meant, only moving a little away from his grandfather after that.

 

The statue did a few backflips, the big clown shoes it wore wiggling in the air before it landed with a bounce. “Please, find a table to wait at. Your order will be here soon.”

 

Chuck did as instructed, taking a seat and waiting. Bill, however, stood at the counter, glaring at the clown as they moved around the kitchen, not letting them out of his sight.

 

“Granddad, come sit down. You don’t need to stand there.”

 

“Like Shakespares’s ghost I don’t. I’m not letting him run from me.”

 

The next five minutes were filled with a lot of unnecessary tension. Bill grunted as he gripped the counter, constantly watching the clown as they fired up the old equipment. Soon, the salty scent of food wafted out of the kitchen and into their noses.

 

“Order up. One special burger for my two special guests. Now remember, only one person can eat this burger.” With that, the clown presented a wrapped burger to Bill, who quickly snatched it up.

 

“Yeah, yeah, I know. Come on, let’s get going.” Bill motioned Chuck to the car. Chuck stopped to give the statue a smile, watching as it returned to its frozen state. When the pair got into the car, Chuck started the engine and then turned to face Bill, waiting for the loving moment when he would offer the burger to him.

 

“Huh? What are you looking at me for? Those were crocodile tears, like I would give you the burger. What do you think I’m stupid? Maybe if you were Chad, I would have.”

 

Chuck lowered his head, realizing he probably should have expected that. As he went to drive off, they heard a thud from above. The roof of the car getting dented, pushing both their heads against it.

“THAT ISN’T VERY FAMILY FRIENDLY OF YOU.” a voice hissed from the window. When Chuck turned, the upside-down face of the statue greeted him. A serpentine forked tongue hanging out from their red lips with a row of sharp teeth exposed in the open mouth.

 

Chuck screamed, his foot instinctively hitting the pedal, sending the car shooting out through the abandoned parking lot. Despite the horror of the situation, Bill calmly unwrapped his burger, taking a bite from it. The thumping clown fist that was colliding with their window not disturbing Bill, even as it left cracks in the glass.

 

“WHAT DO I DO?” Chuck tried to keep the car from crashing, swerving past old shopping trolleys and bins. Despite his pleas, his grandfather didn’t answer, only turning on the radio to a station that played Beethoven. Their escape being accompanied by the Moonlight Sonata.

 

When the window finally cracked open, the clown hand reached for the steering wheel, overpowering Chuck’s grip, directing them towards the Mcdonalds. Despite Chuck’s best attempts, he couldn’t turn the wheel, instead he reached into his pocket, gripping the Swiss army knife.

His first attempt at stabbing the creature failed as he nudged their arm with a nail file. After that, he flicked it to a small blade, stabbing it into the wrist of the clown. The wound shot out spurts of grease as the creature screeched, letting go of the wheel. With only a few seconds left before collision, Chuck turned the wheel, heading for the drive-through. As the car made it through the narrow drive through, he shifted a little to the left, slamming the clown into the speaker outside.

 

When the collision was made, it flung the clown from the car and forced it to the floor. With their vehicle cleared, Chuck headed straight for the road again, escaping from the Mcdonalds. When they were clear of the danger, he turned down the radio and checked to see if his grandfather was alright. When he turned to his grandfather, he saw him looking at the last bit.

 

“Chad might have wrestled a crocodile. But you took down a clown. Here, I want you to have the last bite.” Bill offered, placing the last mouthwatering bite onto his grandson’s lap.

 

“But it won’t work if we both eat it. You have it, you’re the one that wanted to try it.” Chuck went to offer the bite back, only for Bill to grip his hand.

  
“It’s fine. There are a lot of burger chains around. We will get our chance again. Please”

 

Chuck looked at the saliva coated last piece with a bit of disgust, really not wanting to eat it. But what could he do? This was the closest the pair had ever come to having a moment together. He took a deep breath and ate the piece. When the piece of meat hit his tongue, an array of salty flavors greeted him, each one sending his senses into overdrive. It was as if he could see the universe unfolding before him. He knew the answer to every one of life’s questions and he could change the world. He felt unstoppable, but then the feeling faded.

 

 “Wow.” was all Chuck could say, looking at the road ahead.

 

“Wow indeed. Now let’s go home. We have a king to dethrone.” Bill said, giving his grandson a playful nudge on the shoulder.

 

While the act may have seemed a genuine moment of bonding, Bill knew deep down why he did it. He knew that if he didn’t share that burger, the clown would have never stopped its hunt for them. Even if he had powers that could change the world, how long could he evade an immortal brand for? He considered telling Chuck the reason for his generosity, only to decide against it. The boy defeated a clown; he had earned at least one moment.
