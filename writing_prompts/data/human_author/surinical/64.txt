"Antagonistic Declarativism," the man with the impressive beard said, punctuating with a tap of the white board where desperate needs, alien intervention, and occult servitude were each scrawled and x'd out. The students collectively shuffled papers to began new pages of notes as he added the new line.

"This theory posits that heroic and villainic power originates from the power user's body responding literally to a figurative statement by someone viewed oppositionally." He turned and smiled to the groaning class. "Don't worry, you'll like this one."

"Let's look at the case study of Ammo Box," the professor clicked the display and video footage of a grisled, panting man filled the screen, "a neutrally aligned C class hero with the ability to eat and reconstitute any projectile into armor and weapons. This is purported to be the moment his power came into being." He clicked on the display.

"They have my fucking daughter," the man said, banging the phone into his head, causing the camera to go wide for a moment. "I don't care, I don't care! God help me. I'm gonna kill them."

He propped the phone against something to frame as he stepped out from the cover of pallets.

"Hey," the man yelled to someone off screen. "Give her back!"

"Or what asshole?" the voice replied. "Eat lead!"

Gunfire could be heard as the man blurred, chomping down as he jerked his head left and right. 

"Holy shit! He eating them!" the voice replied before the phone toppled over, showing only sky and screams."

"His power," the professor said, "seems to exactly match the statement made by the kidnapper."

A hand shot up and was acknowledged. A dark haired girl stood. "He also was in desperate need, clearly and even makes an appeal to God. It's impossible to isolate if the criminal's statement caused anything."

"Very good analysis, Marta, but nothing's impossible in science" the professor said, erasing the board. "An excellent basis for the homework tonight, actually. Due next week, a five page paper on the complexity of scientific research design to isolate specific power granting causes. How could one determine the nature of origin given controlled-"

"God, this guy's class sucks," a kid near the classroom camera whispered. "I'm never going to pass. He's got it out for me."

A black thread emenated from the baffled professor, swirling as it fed into a glossy orb at the center of the class room above the staring students. A laptop floated up into it, then a desk. The girl's dark hair rose like static as she began to float towards the ball, followed by the rest of the class.

The screaming and crunching began as the camera toppled.

"Damn," Agent Browning said, "would be ironic if it wasn't so morbid. So, the black hole just triggers at the end of lectures? Shouldn't be that hard to take him down before then."

"He's gotten quicker," Agent Lansing said,  tightening his holster with his teeth. Bite marks in the leather showed it to be a common practice. "He can call it down after teaching anything so he'll still struggle with a couple of dumbasses like us."

"I'll still play it safe," Browning said, tossing a furry pink set of ear muffs into his bag. "Let's roll."
