Part 7:

“Next, thank you,” Tom handed the baffled man a hundred dollars and shooed him out of the seat. “Come on, let’s go. Next!”
  

  
The line of men wrapping around the coffee shop scooted forward, and the man in front hurried into the seat. 
  

  
“Have you ever cheated on a girlfriend before?” Tom asked.
  

  
“Yes, well, technically we were-”
  

  
“Next, thank you,” Tom laid another hundred dollars on the table and checked his watch, only now realizing it was a Rolex. Ten minutes left. If this next guy wasn’t it, he’d have to head back. Maybe he could talk Chester, Tucker, whatever his name was into being a better person.
  

  
“Next!” Tom shook his head confused. What was so hard about this?
  

  
“Have you ever cheated on a girlfriend before?” Tom asked.
  

  
“No,” the next man said confidently.
  

  
“Do you own a gun?”
  

  
“No.”
  

  
“Okay, now we’re getting somewhere. Do you want to own a gun?”
  

  
“Oh man, I saw these shotguns on the internet and it looks like something out of sci-fi, but no, not really.”
  

  
“Yes or no is fine,” Tom said. “Do you think men and women are equal?”
  

  
“Well, a really cool quote is, I’m gonna butcher it but, The King's moves in Chess are like the limitations in a man’s life. A Queen has unlimited moves. Party on a yacht? You gotta earn it one square at a time. Female just jumps on board.”
  

  
“And who said that?” Tom asked, counting out five more twenties.
  

  
“Andrew tate.”
  

  
“Yeah, Andrew Tate, though so.” Tom clapped his hands and stood up. “Okay survey over, noone wins!” Tom yelled.
  

  
“Hey, that’s not fair. We’ve been waiting!” one of the guys in line said. “Where’re our hundred dollars?”
  

  
Tom ignored them and gestured to the SUV to whip around. Maria was still sound asleep. The screen displayed a warm candle.
  

  
“Okay, a total bust. Back to the gun range, buddy. Break the sound barrier, I don’t give a shit. Just don’t hurt anyone.”
  

  

  
Tom was immediately tumbling through the backseat as the SUV blurred through the city. It may have been flying, actually. He picked something digging into his neck. “What are all these rocks back here?”
  

  
One of the tentacles twitching out from Maria’s neck had wrapped itself around and past the passenger seat. It swelled and gave a dry pop. A rock fell from the end of it, adding to the pile of small stones rolling around the back of the vehicle.
  

  
“I’m gonna guess that’s not a good sign.”
  

  
Momentum slammed Tom back into the front of the SUV as it slammed to a break.
  

  
Tom got his legs under him and opened the door. The man of the hour was waiting for him in the parking lot, arms crossed.
  

  
“I don’t much appreciate you taking my lady for a little joyride and making me wait,” he said. “I’m of half a mind to tell your bosses-”
  

  
“My bosses don’t give a wet fuck what you say,” Tom said. “Come here, let me show you ‘your girl.’”
  

  
He grabbed the man by the collar and pulled him to the side of the SUV, the tint lightened to show inside.
  

  
“What, what the hell did you do to her?” he yelled. “You’re crazy, man. You can have the money back. I don’t want anything to do with you, okay?”
  

  
“Oh, you’re in this and you’re gonna finish this. Whatever she wants to do, you’re gonna do it, when she says she doesn’t like something, you’re gonna listen and you’re not gonna do it. Simple as that. And if you don’t, those little black things are gonna get a lot bigger and they are going to reach in and eat you from the inside out. Kapeesh?”
  

  
“A man’s place is at the head of the family, I’m supposed to dictate-”
  

  
“Holy shit!” Tom yelled. “It feels like I’m the only sensible guy in this whole town. I set the bar on the fucking ground and you still can’t manage to step over it.”
  

  
“Then why don’t you take then, if you’re so great?”
  

  
Tom stared at Tucker for a moment. “You know, cactus man. That might the first smart thing I’ve heard you say. Hang tight.”
  

  
Tom flicked through his jacket, smelling for the vanilla.
  

  
“What the fuck is that?” Tucker yelled.
  

  
“The end of you,” Tom said, holding the syringe up, “and the beginning.” He set the dial to copy and pressed it into his own leg as the diagram showed. There was no plunger to pull back but he could definitely feel something happening.
  

  
“Agent ego detected, wiping all classified memories, replacing with content-aware fill. Complete.”
  

  
“Just let me go, man. I swear I won’t say anything. I shouldn’t have thought I could mess with you mob guys, I-”
  

  
“Night, night, dummy,” Tom said, twisting the dial to paste. Once the syringe pierced his leg, Tucker stopped moving.
  

  
“Keep functional knowledge of current ego?” the syringe asked. “Functional knowledge includes things such as language, job knowledge, bank pins.” 
  

  
“Yes,” Tom said, nodding as he squatted over Tucker, now sliding down the side of the SUV.
  

  
“Complete,” the helpful syringe said. Tom pocketed it back, shrinking neatly into its hole.
  

  
“Whoa, that’s trippy,” Tucker said. “So I guess I’m the copy. Yeah, wow. I remembered the magic thingy going in.”
  

  
“Yep,” Tom said. “Trippy indeed, so you’re me and you know what you have to do, right?”
  

  
“Yeah, yeah, Keep Maria safe forever, never let her get stressed because of her seizures,” Tucker said.
  

  
“Huh, content-aware fill, Perfect.”
  

  
“Hey guys,” Maria said, stepping out of the SUV. “Sorry about that, guess I was a little jet lagged.”
  

  
“Hey,” Tucker said. “I’m sorry, I’m not really feeling this place. I’m an idiot for bringing you here. Wanna go get coffee instead?”
  

  
“Hell yeah,” Maria said with an incredulous smile. “I could kill for a mocha latte.”
  

  
\*\*\*
  
Outside the coffee shop, Maria looked fully human again, the nape of her neck only smooth skin.
  

  
“ I think I can handle it from here, Mr. Warre. I’m not really the personal assistant type anyway.”
  

  
“Yeah, no worries,” Tom said. “Have a good one.”
  

  
The rear hatch of the SUV opened as he approached. 
  

  
“There is no way this compartment leads to the room Mr. Haq is in.” Tom said and lifted the warm fabric and stepped in. 
  

  
His head spun as the orientation of the room twisted. He was in a grand cafeteria, tables of buffets stretching for what looked like miles, each with its own theme of piping hot food, traditional Mexican sizzling to his left. A vial of orange fluid popped from the ceiling. He caught it and slipping in his pocket. “Good job, buddy. Take a break.”
  

  
“Ah, you’ve found my secret lunch spot,” Mr. Haq said. “Get it sorted with the girl?”
  

  
“Yep, copied my own ego wiped of all the TLO stuff and stuck that in the guy. They’re getting along great.”
  

  
“I have to say, that’s impressively quick on your toes. You really salvaged a doomed mission there. You’re gonna do big things, agent, big things.”
  

  
“I look forward to it, sir. Glad to see that kid isn’t here. Might get some lunch myself.”
  

  
“Oh, he rarely manifests like he did in the suit store, once in a career kind of thing,” Mr. Haq said. “Really freak occurrence to happen on your first time.”
  

  
“It happened again, right after that,” Tom said. “When I was going to the airport.”
  

  
“Huh, I wouldn’t stress about it.” Mr. Haq said casually, laying a napkin on his plate. “Enjoy your lunch.”
  

  
Tom nodded and grabbed a plate.
  

  
Mr. Haq stepped through the nearest door, trying his best not to make eye contact with the boy dressed as a little chef hiding under the table.
  

  
Once on the other side, he took out a phone. “I stapled shut my masks wide mouths, that the one within might feed,” he said into the receiver. 
  

  
“I forgot legions, crowds, and sabouths, yet found not what I need,” came the woman’s voice on the other end.
  

  
“Newest agent, he’s a fixation for BONC. He’s done three pulls and manifested him each time.”
  

  
“So, we get another shot at killing this thing after all. Good work, agent. We’ll get to work right away. So deep, the lines did bleed, honey-thick against the grain.”
  

  
“One hand guts the others lead, then scrubs upon a different stain.”
  

  
The line went dead. Mr. Haq pocketed his phone and began the preparations.
