Knowledge is power

The sign stood out as the one dusted surface amidst the rows of old books, holding up the shelves as much as the shelves did them. The smell of dry decay, so specific to places like this, filled Danny’s nose.

“Grandpa?” he called after seeing the register unmanned.

“Just in the back, my boy. Be out in a moment.”

Hearing his voice sent a pang of guilt through Danny. It had been how long since he’s visited? Even since his father disappeared, his grandfather had practically taken over the role. Even if he had already been in college, whenever one of the little adult tasks of life that seem so daunting the first time came up, grandpa was there to help at the drop of a hat. He deserved more.

“Okay, I figured we could go to lunch at that burger place, my treat!” Danny yelled as he flipped through the books, making sure each was free of spiders first. He recognized several from his last trip here. How did this place stay in business, he wondered, watching the dust motes float and settle in the flickering light.

“Oh my,” grandpa answered. “I best hurry then!”

One book caught his eye, wedged in a corner between two shelves. There was no title. At first, it seemed wedged tight enough to take the building down with it before it came free but after tugging for a moment, it slid out smooth as silk.

The pages were blank, like some kind of unlined diary. He flipped through it, stopping halfway through.

\-Tony’s Place- was scrawled in crayon above a doodle of a small square house.

“Holy shit,” Danny said. “Grandpa, I think I found a drawing my dad did in one of these.”

There was no answer. He turned, feeling an odd tingle on his back. A row of books obscured the entrance and another the windows. He didn’t remember this place being this big.

He sat the book down carefully and stepped back, trying to get his bearings. Each bookshelf-lined hallway forked into two more, in every direction. There was no exit in sight. A soft hum came from behind him, lowering in pitch until it became a chest-rattling croak. He followed the sound, finding himself back at the book he'd found, which now hovered above the table, pages flicking lazily before stopping, showing elaborate calligraphy.

\-Challenge 1 of 256-

Find where inverted swans lie,

And dirty diamond dogs deny

Spy the crow's sway

Twixt the salted whey

And turn its curdled dream awry

“What the hell,” Danny said, face warm as he leaned over the book. The pages twisted again, and a trident, sword, and shovel fell to the floor and new text was displayed.

\-Choose two (enchantments will carry forward into the next challenge)-

\-Bane of Arthropods (recommended)

\-Fire Aspect

\-Knockback

\-Sharpness

\-Smite

\-Sweeping Edge

\-Impaling

A skittering came from Danny’s right, sounding like a rainstorm of tiny footsteps. He looked at the page again, focusing on the word recommended. “Shit.”
