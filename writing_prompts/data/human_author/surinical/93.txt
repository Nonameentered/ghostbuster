Part 3:

"Forgive my father, Pete the Elder, your great grandfather if you're not keeping up," Douglas said as the server set down the ales. "He came back from the war a different man. When he went missing, we all figured he-"

"Can it, boy" the Elder said. "I can speak perfectly fine for myself." He tipped his ale and finished it in one long pull.

The table waited a beat to see if he would add anything else. He did not.

"I served in the war to end all wars," Bart grumbled. "Half the men I served with drew their full issue by the narpoo. Didn't mess me up."

"They didn't call it that for long," Douglas said. "The one Peter the Elder was in was bigger by a fair bit. I only saw the tail end of mine, Korea, but it was bloody enough. No need to shame anyone here. We’re all men.”

“Vietnam, here. Proud roughneck,” Pete the younger said, or maybe just Dad would be easier. Dad sipped his ale. “What about you, Mikey? What hell pit did good ole Uncle Sam drag you into?”

“I wasn’t in a war. They had a round two in Iraq right after you left, but no draft or anything.”

“Thank god for that,” Dad said, raising his mug. Douglas and Pete the Elder, surprisingly, joined him.

“Thank God for what?” Bart asked. “That one of the men watching your back out here in Mesopolonica gonna be soft as a girl’s puzzle patch, greener than a coathook?”

“Come around this table, and try saying that silent movie bullshit!” Dad said, slamming down both hands. They glowed slightly. “By Dale, ain’t nobody on this Earth Imma let talk bout my boy that way, great granddaddy and strong as a bull or not.”

Several of the surrounding tables clutched their drinks, clearly accustomed to the occasional brawl.

“Dad, don’t,” Michael said. “I’m tough enough to not be bothered by an old man calling me soft.”

Bart raised his eyebrows towards Michael, clearly not expecting him to stand up for himself. “Old man, eh?”

“Normally, I’d be all for this, gentlemen,” Douglas said, spreading his arms and gesturing both to sit. “But given what we saw coming in, time is a bit of the essence.”

“Fine,” Dad said. “I’ll mark you down as TBD on my busting ass list, Bartholemew.”

“Back to the matter at hand,” Douglas said. “There’s three main problems. One, the only way in or out is the front gate, above the great moat, nearly thick as the walls and doesn’t open for anyone. Two, dogs was underselling it a bit. Massive hounds, big as bears, and lastly, Golgotha, Skull I mean, has a huge avian of some type. When we get close, he might escape on it, and take that ticket out of here with him.”

“That does sound difficult,” Michael said. “So, what do we do?”

“You’re lucky, son, coming in near the end of the shift. We got it all worked out,” Dad said. “Farm south of here has a fertilizer repository, concentrated batshit. Pete the Elder here says if we get him enough, he can mix up a bomb big enough to blow a hole in the side of that thing.”

“As for the dogs,” Douglas said, waggling two of the empty mugs in the air. “There’s a man, a bard that plays a magic flute, tames animals with it. He has a show this very night. We nab it, and I’ll sing those not-so-lovelies to sleep.”

“And I’ll make sure the big man doesn’t run off,” Bart said. “Two of his boys go drinking and whoring every night, same brothel every time. If they aren’t there when I go, the girls will know where to find them. Ain’t no one a man tells more to than his whore.”

“How does that stop him from running off?” Michael asked.

“I’ll snatch ‘em and keep them tied up somewhere safe. Make sure he knows I got ‘em too. He’s already shown how partial he is to his boys. He won't leave till he faces me, make me give them up.” Bart smiled then for the first time, a wild, manic thing, no happiness in it. Dad was brave or crazy to yell at this lunatic.

“Alright, so me and Pete the Younger here will attend the concert,” Douglas offered. “Bart clearly works best alone. He’ll nab the two boys. Do try not to kill them this time granddad.”

“Me and Michael will make the bomb,” Pete the Elder said, nodding. “We need the wagon.”

“Understate when you tempt fate, father, remember,” Douglas whispered with a smile. “Yes, that was the urgency with which I referred earlier. A perfectly serviceable wagon just pulled up outside. Michael, I’m guessing you cannot drive a horse-drawn coach?”

“That would be a fair assumption,” Michael said, pointing. “But I can drive a manual transmission.”

“Utterly irrelevant, but noted,” Douglas said. “Dad? You up for a little highway robbery?”

“Yes,” Pete the Elder said, just as the waitress sat two drinks down. He picked it up and downed it quick as the first.

“Darling,” Douglas said to the waitress. “Would this be enough to cover our two rounds?” He twirled a gold coin between his fingers before presenting it to her.

“I can’t break that, sweetie.”

“And I’m not asking you, too, my Helen of Troy.” He placed it in her palm and closed it. “Consider it recompense for our less than polite demeanorr.”

“Oh,” she said, blushing. “I’ve seen far rowdier tonight. Y’all travel safe.”

Douglas turned, opening his eyes wide and nodding to the door.

“I hadn’t even tried my beer,” Michael said, sipping it. He immediately gagged.

“Satisfied? Come on, now,” Douglas jerked him by his collar. He was incredibly strong, picking Michael up easily. The group scurried out as more guests entered. Their table was already being cleaned and resat. A child of ten or so was finishing Michael’s ale, relishing it.

“Sorry to hustle everyone, but I paid that lovely tart with a chocolate and didn’t want to be there when she found out.” Douglas walked towards the wagon. A man was brushing one of the horses.

“A mighty fine pair there, friend,” Douglas said, approaching the man, hand out to shake. “Say you wouldn’t be the driver I met in Catterdan, would you?”

Just as the man started to answer, Douglas beat him over the head with something from his pocket. “All aboard, lads!” he yelled as he clung on to the side. Pete the Elder wide stepped over the downed man and hopped up into the driver’s seat, leaning over a hand to help Michael up beside him.

“All on, goose it boy!” Bart yelled, smacking the side of the wagon. Michael bit his tongue as the horses whinnied and began building speed down the bumpy dirt road.

“Killed a horse thief once,” Pete the Elder said, calmly guiding the reins. “On the farm after Da left, just before the war, buckshot through the chest.”

“That so? Life makes hypocrites of us all,” Michael answered, laughing nervously.

The driver remained stone-faced, watching the road ahead.
