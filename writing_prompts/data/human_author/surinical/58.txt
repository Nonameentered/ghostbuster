“There isn’t much time, human. Don this.”
  

  
From a dark corner of the abandoned factory, a cone-shaped hat rolled, tulle top collecting dirt and moss along the way.
  

  
“Where am I?” Amber yelled, standing up. She had been walking back to her car when someone grabbed her. She rubbed her shoulders and their matching sets of bruises.
  

  
“This is the lair of Gredendalax, Empress Wyrm!” the woman’s voice retorted, echoing against the vine-covered walls.
  

  
“So, it's not the old shoe factory on the edge of town?” Amber said, glancing around for the exit. “Because it looks like the old shoe factory on the edge of town.”
  

  
“Whatever previous footwear-based assembly occurred here is wholly irrelevant!” the women said, stepping forward. She looked attractive but older and comically dressed like she was preparing for her role in Othello. Her frilly drapery caught on rusty nails. “Forgive my appearance, since we have awoken from our long golden slumber, the magic of the world seems thin. It will take some time to manifest our true form.”
  

  
“Sure, sure,” Amber said. “But I was just gonna get scooting, actually. Busy day, you know how it is.”
  

  
“It has been hard,” the woman said, walking closer with an odd melodic gait. “I want my daughter’s hatch day to be grand but she requested a princess. Now before our rest, it seemed you couldn’t throw a log without hitting some princess or another, but things are more complicated now. I fear war with this aged humanity. Your weapons have gotten very loud”
  

  
“Right, right, hate that,” Amber said as she backed up slowly.
  

  
“But, I realized with a streak of mind lightning,” the woman said, spreading her eyes as she leaned forward, hinting at a livelihood that didn’t match her appearance. “What is a princess but a maiden in a hat? So the deal is you wear the hat, pretend to be a princess and we’re golden.”
  

  
“Okay,” Amber replied, looking down at the hat. “But deals usually serve both parties, so seems a bit unbalanced. I’ll think on it, but I really must get going.”
  

  
“Of course, my apologies.” The woman reached in her pockets down almost to the elbow and came up with a hand overflowing with glimmering gold and jewels. “Whatever you can carry,” she said.
  

  
Amber rocked her head back and forth for a moment then popped on the hat. “I am Princess Amber, at your service!”
