Hey, just to chime in. The automod post on WPs says you don't have to fulfill every detail of the prompt, which I do in varying degrees. I didn't have a good idea that focused on that so I mostly ignored it.

At the same time, I get what you're saying, it would have been better if I focused on what made people like the prompt, the idea the mimic is pretending to be human. Which is probably true now that I look back on it. I always welcome critical comments so thanks for the input.
