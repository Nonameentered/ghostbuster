"Human," the bulbous alien said, moving one of its three masses up and down behind the counter.

It was difficult for Sam to decide where to look. The hazy yellow skin was interrupted in no spots that looked like eyes. "Yes," he said.

"That was not a question requiring answer. It was a statement of incredulity. Apologies if the translation device malfunctioned." The alien turned and returned, popping a wooden box on the table. "Within this box are symbolic soldiers, used in the logic competition. The Halruns have for some reason submitted you as their champion. I highly doubt you have a chance to win a single match. Your gray matter is exclusively grown in your quite modestly sized cranium. And so many orifices! I don't know how you think with various fluids constantly leaking out of you."

Screw you too, buddy, Sam thought. He opened the box to find it full of something strangely recognizable in this alien world, half a set of wooden chess pieces, smoky gray. 

"I don't know," he said, checking that his smartwatch still had battery left and the modified version of stockfish he installed last year. "I think I might have a shot."

"You will not be permitted to take that device with you into the challenge arena. Full external body scans will be done to ensure you are not wearing it.  I am unfamiliar with your species, will you require anything else for preparation other than your clothes?"

"Yeah," Sam said with wretched acceptance of what he must do next. "I need a bottle of oil or something slick and non toxic."

"For your ..." The translated alien voice carried the disgust very well.

Sam nodded gravely, hoping the question remained unfinished.

The alien slid a bottle of clear viscous liquid across the counter and pointed to a wide door. "Please do whatever you have to do in private, human."

Sam closed the door. There was something not dissimilar to a toilet but various other holes and brushes along the walls.

He took off the watch, started the program, and began to do what it would take to be the champion. He would save mankind, no matter the cost.
