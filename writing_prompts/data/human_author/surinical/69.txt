Part 11:

Michael felt himself, his body was human still but it was dressed and red and blue robes.
  

  
He walked, careful not to run in this in-between place on his second visit. The steps echoed somewhere distant.
  

  
As his vision returned, he was disappointed to find himself standing on a beach he didn't recognize, gray sky obscuring the late morning sun.
  
A man stood there beside a large shepherd dog sitting at attention.
  

  
As Michael approached, he saw that it was Caleb, wearing a wide headdress of feathers.
  

  
"Son!" Michael yelled." Where’s that bastard sent you here?"
  

  
"I am the son of all fathers," the man spoke, sounding nothing like Caleb. The voice came from his own mouth and the dog’s in a strange harmony. "I am the father of all sons. What would you have of me? Have you come to take me to the classer woman, curl this world into her frenzied weave?"
  

  
"You're the spirit in the statue. You just look like my son. He's safe at school right now?"
  

  
The man nodded, looking at the waves. "My land once had oceans as yours does."
  

  
"I want to go home to my land, the wetter world, and my father and his father, Pete the Elder, and Bart too if they can be brought back to life."
  

  
"I cannot revive the dead. That falls under the purview of another. Furthermore, the time of your father and his father has passed. Their absence is carved into the world, making up you and much else. If Douglas never left, your father's path would be different, you would not exist, and Caleb would not exist. I can bring you back to your time, I believe, the comparative divergence can be compressed, stretched past the midnight of your coming.”
  

  
"You have to do something for my father and grandfather, at least. They don't belong in your world. Please."
  

  
"You are a good father, Michael, and a good son. Come, sit with me and I will show you the way the worlds are weaved.”

The neighbor shielded his nosy eyes from the sun as he watched the roaring Mustang make its way down Sycamore Street.
  

  
"Huh," Dana said to herself, shaking her head as she sat down the streamers. She whistled, walking down the road. "Change your mind, I see. You travel all night to get this thing? A call would have been nice. I covered for your boss this morning, by the way, told him was a family emergency."
  

  
"You see,” she continued, stepping in front of the muscle car. “I figured it either was an emergency for you to leave in the middle of the night without saying anything or it was going to be an emergency when you came home and I murdered you."
  

  
"Sweetheart," Michael said, sitting down the cake on the hood and almost crushing her with a hug. "I'm so sorry. I missed you so much."
  

  
"Easy Hulk Hogan. If you break my ribs, I can't blow up the balloons."
  

  
"Beaut, ain't she?" the man in the driver seat asked, revving the engine so loud she couldn't hear what he said next. He stepped out of the car looking like a Budweiser advertisement from the 90s, acid-washed jeans, mullet and all.
  

  
"You think I'mma let a Hartfield run around in a Chevy? And a compact at that? No sir!"
  

  
"Michael, who's your friend?" Dana asked, staring at the man with the same nose as her husband.
  

  
"Dana, this is my dad," Michael said, giving her a pressed-lip smile.
  

  
"Pete, a pleasure to meet you. Don't know how my son managed to snag a girl so beautiful."
  

  
"Holy shit," Dana said, staring baffled at Michael as she reached out to shake the man's hand. "Dana, pleasure to meet you. You look so young. You and Michael could be twins."
  

  
"I take vitamins," he said, rolling his shoulders. "Lots of yoga, you know, hippy-dippy stuff."
  

  
"Please, come inside and get a drink," she offered.
  

  
"Nah, I don't want to intrude. You're about to have this birthday party for Caleb. I don't want to steal the thunder out of all that by having my reappearance shake everything up. I'll stop by tomorrow to meet him and make sure he knows how to treat his new baby right."
  

  
"Are you sure? You're more than welcome," Dana said, hugging Michael's side. He smelled like camping, not unpleasant at all.
  

  
"Positive, me and Doug have a bushel of errands to run, and speak of the devil." The man turned to wave down a cherry red restored 50's truck.
  

  
The truck pulled up and the driver gave an elaborate wave in return. Pete slid over the hood to much complaint from the driver.
  

  
"So, we've got a lot to talk about," Dana said to her husband as the men drove away. "After the party, of course. You're on streamer duty."
  

  
"Of course. Hey, I'm glad everything's okay but weren't you worried about me?"
  

  
"Yeah, I figured that Mr. dad of the year would either be back on time for the party or be dead. I don't think anyone could put up with your bear snoring enough to kidnap you. I was compartmentalizing and putting my freak out on hold till then."
  

  
He leaned to kiss her but she put a finger on his lips to stop him. "I didn't say I wasn't mad. But if I was going to forgive you and that's a big if, hearing from your dad that you haven't seen in 20 years? That's a pretty good excuse, I guess."
  

  
“Thank you,” Micheal said.
  

  
"They're cute together, Pete and Doug. A couple of car guys." Dana smiled as she began chopping vegetables on a fold-out table.
  

  
"What? Whoa, no. My dad and Doug are not gay. No way."
  

  
"Okay Mr. Defensive," Dana said, smiling. "Think he'll stick around this time?"
  

  
"I do," Michael said, sliding the cake into the garage fridge. "I really do."
