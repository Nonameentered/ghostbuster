The ship careened a more and more frantic path as the vessel traced the lines of the rising waves.

"I fear you have not been honest as to the true nature of this voyage," the captain yelled to the young man faced away, towards the sea. "You bring nothing with you aboard and there's nothing out this far that any man should want to catch besides."

The man stood still without concern for the growing storm or the damp clothes clinging to the skin. "And if I admit it? The storm swells worse behind us," he said, voice just discernable. "No matter why we are here, we must continue forward."

"Do you mean to give yourself to these waters? I won't take part in such a thing." The sea beneath them grew black, like the shadow of an unseen eclipse. 

The captain had heard others tell of such phenomena and that any sailor that stared into that absence was left hollow or raving.

The young man held up a rock and smiled back at the captain. "But a message." He dropped it into the black and stared.

"Best you not to look at that, boy. Just let it pass, whatever it is." The captain stepped beside him, having to cling to the rail.

"Wise advice, he is ugly," the young man said, waiting expectantly.

The rock popped back up, bouncing onto the deck, followed by a black barnacle covered bag. The young man opened it and smile, shielding it's contents from the rain.

"We may return when the storm clears," the young man said, hefting the bag over the shoulder. "It is done."

The captain bent down and picked up the Rock, common as they come but upon it a message scrawled. It's meaning was unknown to him.
