"Shiiiiiiit!" Simon called out as he threw his hands in front of his face. 

There was no airbag for them to block. Gone too was the cacophony of shearing metal and squealing tires.

Had he gone over the side? He wondered. Where was Mary?

Something in the way his yell carried through the darkness around him left him uneasy. 

"Hello!" he yelled, trying to find something to yell towards.

There was no echo. There was barely any sound at all.

He wasn't even standing, he realized, but hanging in the air, suspended. By twisting, he could make out three points of light cut through the dark.

A mixture between swimming and flailing slowly drifted him closer to the lights. They were illuminated words, carved stark into floating stone.

"New life, load life, cheat menu," Simon spoke, reading the three sets floating side by side. " What the fuck."

A distant voice laughed below him .

He drifted closer. Not until he neared the radiant heat of the words could he tell how cold he had been. He shivered as he swam closer, almost touching the words' new life. He hesitated and looked down. His body felt heavy.

"Hello?" he tried again, cupping his hand to make his thin voice carry down. For one disorienting moment he thought he could make out a floor down there with a handful of people walking back and forth.

"Hello," an equally thin voice called back. "You'll want to make your way down here or you'll fall in a few minutes."

Simon swam towards the voice, flickering fades of the room yhe'd seen through the blackness coming again. By the time he reached the bottom he stood in a hazy Gray train station with a large set of stairs leading up to the still vibrantly bright words. His shoes landed on the floor with a click. He still felt like but far from weightless.

"Heart attack?" The voice asked again from just beside Simon.

A blur obscured the station behind it, as did several other blurs wandering through. Squinting, Simon could just make out a wide hat.

"Excuse me? Heart attack?" Simon asked the blur, the face convalescing at its center looks very young.

"You just look like a fancy businessman, late nights, stress, number one killer statistically, figured it was what got you."

Simon understood the man perfectly but somehow also realized he wasn't speaking English. "What got me? Where are we? I was driving with my daughter, six but she's tall for her age. Have you seen her?"

"Car wreck, it's nasty, but I suppose most are. I was stuck in bed for weeks, the doctors had given up, were just keeping me comfortable. Had a lot of time to think." A thin hand emerged from the blur and pointed back up. Simon followed to see a line of people flowing in a stream, appearing from one end at a rate of about two a second and drifting towards the letters. 

How had he missed them when he was up there? He was afraid to look away, miss his daughter. "Mary!" he called out. A few of the blurry people towards the end looked down confused, but only one was a child and that one a boy.

"That's why most people wait, from what I've seen, the people that don't press a button right away," the blur man beside Simon said. "I've been here longer than most of them, a couple years."

Simon watched the people approach the buttons, some pressing each, cheat menu being the most common. Regardless of what they pressed, they simply disappeared without a sound.

"Is that why you don't press it?" Simon asked without looking away.

The man sighed. "No," Simon spared a glance to see the man was much more visible now. He looked Asian and wore a hospital gown. "Afraid of the pain, maybe, or it's absence here just seems so nice I'm not ready to leave. I always like watching people through the windows. It's like this place was made for me. The longer you stay here, the clearer it becomes. You can't tell yet, but this is a beautiful place."

"Mary!" Simon yelled, seeing his girl above him. She stood confused yelling amidst the overlapping people drifting faster. She couldn't hear him.

"How do I float again or fly or whatever?" He asked the no longer blurry man. 

"You don't, once your heavy enough to land, it sticks."

Simon tried to Sprint towards the stairs as Mary swam above him. He lost her in the crowd for a moment and then spotted her again. She was almost beating him to the words. "Mary, wait!" he yelled.

She twisted for a second but began swimming again. He could hear her teeth tapping as she shivered. "Mary!" he tried again, cupping his hands and yelling so hard he felt a blood vessel burst in his eye.

She looked right at him, "Dad?" she said and she rested a hand on the load life button and was gone.

Simon wanted to scream out but didn't waste the breath, running up the stairs as fast as he could. As he reached the letters, he heard the man behind him laugh. He pressed a palm to the second L of load life. It felt like smooth skin.

He was standing in a well furnished study with three chairs. He recognized it as the upper classroom common room of the posh academy his brothers had attended. As he stepped towards the chairs, he could see a series of dials on the wall. One went from 1987 to now, another was for months, another for days, another for hours, another minutes, another seconds and several beyond that.

He twisted the first dial.
