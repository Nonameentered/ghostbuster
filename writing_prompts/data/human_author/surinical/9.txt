Part 6:

“This is the stuff,” Paradise said, bending down in the aisle of the drug store. “You want the one with aloe and lidocaine, for sure.”

“Wait, you don’t have some super sci-fi magic healing cream I can use instead?” Tina asked over the lady yelling at the employees in the pharmacy. She looked down at the bottle.

“No, lesson one, never reach for a complex tool when a simple one does the job,” Paradise said, stepping in line behind the frantic woman.

“Is Gabe really gone? He’s never coming back?” Tina asked. “He’s off being an angel of math or whatever?”

“Most likely,” Paradise offered back, wrinkling her also sunburnt nose. “If they feel like it, fickle as they are, they can come back. That coin I flipped was the token one of the Sabaoth gave me once. She told me to flip it if and only if I had another ready to go home. Luckily, Gabe had changed his mind somewhere along the way so I didn’t have to figure out what would have happened if he said no.”

The lady ahead of them stormed off, leaving a pint of ice cream on the counter.

“So, where are we going after this?” Tina asked as Paradise approached the counter and pointed to the wall of decongestants, nodding as the employee pulled one off.

“Back to the unnamed headquarters. A certain promising talent showed amazing ingenuity and I believe there may be an opening in our little operation.”

“What if I don’t want the job?” Tina asked.

“I saw you at lunch, young lady. You want the job.”

As Paradise finished ringing out, Tina felt a pointy stone in her shoe. She sat and fished it out discreetly seeing it was not a stone at all, but a twenty-sided die. It wouldn’t be much use though as every side read twenty. Tina smiled, decided up was as good of a direction as any and tapped her fist twice to her chest.
