*It’s time to train.*

The lingering voice carried from the dream as Caleb woke, twisting ropes of metal replaced by the ceiling of his room. It was true, he admitted to himself as he struggled into a shirt. Sleeping didn’t help. He was going insane.

*We need to train.*

“Okay Mr. voice in my head, noted but I think I’ll go to work instead.” Caleb yawned and stretched, feeling comfortably tight on his muscles. He looked over yesterday’s pants and decided they were still serviceable at least one more day.

*You need to train for what is to come. Those of the Calis are already well on their way. I can delay them no longer.*

“I’m sure they are,” he said as he stumbled into the bathroom. The door unstuck itself as he pressed it. At least some things got better on their own. “I’ll make you a deal. Leave me alone while I work and we will train after. Sound good, figment of my imagination?”

Caleb noticed his beard was finally starting to fill in. Finishing puberty at twenty-two?

*I am no figment. Watch.*

Caleb looked in the mirror, both seeing and feeling a small black tendril slide across the white of his eye. “Nope, nope,” he said, turning away. “Ignore the crazy. Ignore the crazy.”

“You good, bud?” Alex asked from the living room as Caleb barged through the apartment.

“Yeah, yeah, just singing along to a song,” Caleb said as he stepped outside. His roommate’s pressed smile showed little sign he convinced him of anything.

*Why do you labor?*

“Why do I work?” Caleb hissed. “Because I need money.” He set to work scraping his car.

*Why do you need money?*

“I don’t know. Food to eat, clothes to wear, an apartment.”

*There is food.*

Caleb felt a compulsion pull his neck up. There was a deer grazing at the edge of the parking lot. He was suddenly starving. He had had deer jerky once.

He sighed. “I can’t eat a wild deer.”

*Yes, you can. That is what your kind are meant to eat, not food bars*

“Okay, new deal. If you can tell me how I can catch that deer, I’ll call into work.”

*Chase it.*

Caleb almost lost his footing as a wave of tingling fire worked down his legs. “I can’t-” he started before feeling the primal need to move his muscles. Maybe a jog would be good. They didn’t really need him till ten anyway.

He pushed off his car and sprinted towards the deer. It bolted off into the trees.

“See, I told you!” Caleb said, turning back to see his car scooted half out of the spot, front fender dented in. “Wait, I did that?” He jogged back to the sedan and pulled the front. It was heavy but he was able to drag it back to its spot, pulling the dent mostly back into place in the process.

*We need to train.*

Maybe he wasn’t insane after all.
