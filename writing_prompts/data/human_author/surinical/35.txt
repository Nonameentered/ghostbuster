A single sharp note carried through the chambers.

"When I was a young one," the grand good dragon Galdur began, his inhuman aria slowing the coming sycophants.

"I'm sorry to interrupt you," the humans captain said. "But you're the only one we can turn to. You alone have defeat a Na Niphesh, a black dragon."

The dragon looked up, fearing what words would come next from the little man. "And?"

"A Na Niphesh again rides through the kingdom, you must kinslay again."

Galdur sighed and stood, pulling the lever for the central dome to open. He alone knew he had done no such thing, the black dragon he had defeated had been himself going through a phase, but lately in this golden hall, it felt like this was the pretending. A true black dragon destroy him without effort. "I'll go."
He didn't stay to hear what the man said next. There was no preparation he would know.

Galdur grabbed sky with his wings, seeing the flames along the south side of the city. The thundering screams blended together into a cacophony of sound.

"My father took me into the city," Galdur sang as he spared towards his end.
