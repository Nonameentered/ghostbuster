Part 6:

“What the hell are they doing?” Douglas asked as Pete the Elder pushed the wagon into a shaded area off the road beside where the horses were tied. Michael hid as best he could by the tree line, unaccustomed to his present bulk.

“We’ll push the wagon across the bridge when it comes to it, you and me. I’m not sending the horses to their death.” Pete said.

Michael tried to answer reflexively but silenced the grunt. He bowed his head instead.

“At least they don’t seem to be paying us much mind,” Dad said, looking at the guards in their strange hyena masks, long fake tongues lolling as they danced around a fire.”

“Demonic rituals,” Bart spat, hefting his great ax, looking feral in his smeared facepaint. “Doesn’t matter beyond that. Our coming will be a mercy upon them.”

“I think it might matter if it causes that.” Douglas pointed to a figure beyond the fire, swelling in size with each round of chanting. It raised a twisted and swollen snout to the air, nostrils flexing.

“Good think we’ve got our own beast,” Bart smiled back. “We need to take out this group quick as we can. That will give us a straight shot across the bridge to blow the gate.”

“Ready,” Douglas said, the first man Michael had seen to dual wield a dagger and a pan flute.”

Both Petes nodded. Michael realized they were waiting for him. Me bowed his head and scraped the ground, bringing up a fat tuff of grass.

Bart yell out a deep, rattling cry as he charged forward, arms like a batter ready to swing.

The dancers stopped and scrambled to gather weapons. Michael hefted himself forward, roaring as he gained momentum. He crashed into a man as Bart swung. An arm slapped onto the ground, hand still a fist. A wave of heat rose on Michael’s fur. The man beneath his paws was gasping, gripping weakly onto his front leg. Michael pressed down harder and swiped at another man almost on him. His claws ripped into his face as easy as stripping bark from a tree.

Amidst the cacophony, a slow melody played to his left. He saw the massive beast galloping on its way towards the horses. Michael turned to chase the thing almost as big as him. A nick of pain hit him and he jerked, pulling a spearman forward to trip and fall. Without thinking, he bent and stretched his mouth around the man’s head.

The man reached widely, grabbing the spear still in Michael’s side and pressed, directing more pain to roll through him. Michael squeezed down and thrashed back and forth, snapping the man at neck and back. He looked back to the beast, who had slid to a stop and was laying still.

Michael turned back just in time to see Bart deliver a log-splitting chop down on a kneeling man's head. He split him through clean to the torso. There were no enemies left, save the monster dog. The entire fight had lasted less than a minute.

Douglas took out his dagger and brought it to the beast’s throat.

“Wait,” Pete the Elder said, stepping over a charred pair of bodies. He began looking over the collar.

“Whatever you’re doing, be quick,” Douglas said, still holding the dagger pressed against the fur. “It’s not going to stay out much longer.”

“Boy always was too soft on dogs,” Bart said, wiping the blood off his ax of the ground. “Had one run back home after I sold it. Found it snuggled up in bed with him.”

“Here,” Dad said beside Michael. “That one got you pretty good if you didn’t notice, hoss. This’ll bite.” He yanked out the spear and immediately placed a hand over the wound, mumbling something to himself. The pain rose sharp then faded slow, replaced by itching warmth. Dad scratched the spot and then patted twice. “Ride on.”

Pete the Elder pulled a long string of cloth away from the beast. Michael recognized the long steaming cloth. The beast’s skin rolled and boiled before it shrank down, still misshapen but the size of a german shepard rather than a horse.

“Could still give us trouble,” Bart said. “Just don’t get sore assed if I have to send a few of them to the pit.”

“Alright, lets light this thing,” Douglas said. “Go ahead and get ready for crossing the bridge.”

The black tar covered wood structure stood tall, resting on a central plateau, high above a dry ravine. Only a single bridge led to the center.

“Hold on, gotta check something,” Bart said, walking over to the bridge. “One of them tried to get away from me and went for the forest rather than to his buddies over there. Sometimes, when we advanced, the Germans would blow the bridges ahead of us and sometimes,” He crouched down firm on the ground and slapped the flat of his ax hard against the wooden slats. The bridge began to groan. “Sometimes they’d try something smarter.”

The bridge twisted left before cracking and falling in two big pieces into the ravine below. A huge cloud of dust rose as it landed with a deep thud.

“Well shit, they rigged the bridge to fall. That would have killed us, for sure,” Dad said.

“Now as for how the hell we get the wagon over there now,” Bart said, whistling. “I’m open to suggestions.”

Michael looked down the sunless ravine, then squinted at the distance to the center. The bear couldn’t smile, but he would have. He stood beside the wagon and pawed at the front, at his own chest, then he hopped.

“Son,” Douglas said to Pete the Younger. “Yours might just be the craziest of all of us.”
