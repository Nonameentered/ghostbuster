Thank you, first off!

As for why eggs, eggs-in-moonshine is an old timey phrase meaning a fanciful notion or an unrealistic/ ludicrous concept, dating from before the association of moonshine with illegal spirits distilled under the light of the Moon. 

I'm enamored with the way that Shakespearean Elizabethan English blended a lot to help form Appalachian vernacular so this felt like the perfect title and the story came after. I also like the trepitation of wanting to experience the powerful dreams competing against the gross out factor of eating eggs of some unknown thing floating in some unknown liquid.
