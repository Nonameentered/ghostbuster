Part 6:

“Okay, car,” Tom said as he lifted Maria up as carefully as possible to sit back. “Call Mr. Haq.” The seat reclined slowly.
  

  
A screen popped up from the center console and showed a blur of thousands of faces and names. \*beepbeepbeep\*
  

  
“Mr. Haq that works for the TLO,” Tom said. The screen scrolled as faces disappeared until only two were left. He clicked on the one he recognized. The surface of the screen felt like warm oily skin.
  

  
“I take upon the hallowed sky,” Mr. Haq spoke through the speakers, “and dust it atop the many tables. Leave a message.”
  

  
“Okay, Mr. Haq, we have tentacles here, sir. I might be in over my head. I don’t know if-”
  

  
“Oh hey Agent Middleditch, how do you like the car? If it hasn’t killed you yet, you’re probably good. Those R&D boys really are something.”
  

  
“Fine, fine.” Tom blinked, deciding to circle back to that later. The SUV beeped twice cheerfully. “Look, the mission is not going well. She hates the guy. I think he lied on his test. She's definitely in soul searching mode, big black tentacles coming out.”
  

  
“Gotcha, gotcha,” Mr. Haq said casually. “Don’t sweat it. The settling procedure only works about half the time. Did more than ten feet of worm get out yet? Got a casualty estimate?”
  

  
“Uh, no, just a few inches, like legs maybe.” Tom carefully pulled back her hair. The strands were still there but were squirming much slower than before. “And no casualties, I gave her a cookie and it knocked her out.”
  

  
“really like it … touch my hair, Mr. Warre,” Maria mumbled, eyes still closed. “Hair, Warre hair.” 
  

  
“Sounds like it, good job thinking on your feet. I’m impressed,” Mr. Haq said. “Okay, right jacket inside, three down, four across, should be vanilla.”
  

  
“Got it.” Tom reached into the jacket and ran his finger across. There were even more pockets on this side. “Hot sauce, no. School book fair, no. Vanilla!” He pulled out a syringe as long as his arm, the needle was covered in glowing symbols. On the side of the barrel were a few dials, one with three settings, cut, copy, and paste. “What the hell is this thing?”
  

  
“Ego manipulator, like the rest, very intuitive. The Branscombe bread you fed her should keep her out of it for a half hour or so.” It sounded like Mr. Haq was eating something. “Try and find a better guy for her, copy his ego and then pop it into the dingbat that wasn’t honest on the survey. It literally said answering the questions truthfully was a matter of life and death so I wouldn’t feel too bad for him over a little ego annihilation.”
  

  
“Okay, but we’re at a gun range. I doubt she’s gonna like any guy here.” He put the scary contraption back.
  

  
“Gotcha, well it was a long shot. The back hatch is a BONC door if you haven’t noticed yet. Just haul her back here and we’ll scrap it. We can kill the worms, just takes a lot of resources. The FTA program is kind of a green solution, but it's not always practical.”
  

  
“No, hold on. Let me at least try first.” 
  

  
“Alright,” \*click\* Mr. Haq’s face left the screen. 
  

  
“Okay, so I just have to find a guy who’s nice, doesn’t like guns, and isn’t an asshole, inject a scifi probe into him, copy his soul and then come back here and bob’s your uncle. Car, take me back to the city. Use roads, you can drive fast but don’t risk hurting anyone.”
  

  
\*beepbeep\* Tom gripped the handle and tried to hold Maria still with the other hand. The SUV took ‘drive fast’ very liberally. The world outside the windshield blurred. He could just make out the approaching town.
  

  
“Uh, take me to a coffee shop. No, an ATM first,” Tom managed to say. Luckily, Maria seemed unaffected by the g forces, still as the stones.
  

  
With a squelch of the tires, the SUV stopped at a bank drive-through ATM, pulling up very close to the one car in front of them.
  

  
\*honkhonkhonk\* The SUV revved its engine.
  

  
The lady flipped Tom off as she pulled away. 
  

  
“I appreciate the urgency, buddy, but I don’t want to piss anyone off, either! Okay?” 
  

  
He received a very sad pair of beeps in response.
  

  
Tom leaned out and inserted the card Mr. Haq had given him.
  

  
\-Available funds: $2,147,483,647.00-
  

  
\-Withdrawl?- 
  

  
“Jesus.” Tom typed in $2,220 quickly, hoping the magic card bypassed the $400 limit.
  

  
He had to pull the stack as it counted so it didn’t spill over into the road. He had to cram to fit all the twenties in his pockets.
  

  
“Okay, now a coffee shop, the busiest one in town,” Tom said, already gripping the handle in preparation.
  

  
“Mocha latte, medium, oat milk, hot,” Maria whispered sleepily. “Please thank you.”
  

  
The SUV ripped off again, weaving through traffic with impossible precision. The SUV slammed to a halt to let an old man walking an older dog cross in front of them. The speakers played elevator waiting music.
  

  
“Okay, yeah I get it. You’re not pissing anyone off. I’m sorry I yelled at you.”
  

  
\*beepbeep\*
  

  
The SUV continued and swung into a parking spot under a sign that read ‘BIG RED EXPRESS’ above a cartoon boy pouring a pot of coffee into his mouth.
  

  
“Great, okay.” Tom said, “I’m going inside. Make sure she stays asleep. If she starts to wake up or get too wormy, take her back to TLO, okay?”
  

  
\*beepbeep\* Gentle thunderstorms started to play over the speakers as the temperature dropped at least ten degrees. The seatbelt over Maria stretched out, looking more like a membranous wing than fabric, wrapping around her like a blanket.
  

  
“Alright!” Tom yelled with the most authority he could muster as he pushed his way into the crowded business, holding up and waggling a few of the twenties. “Any straight males 18-35 want to make $100 for a 5-minute survey?”
