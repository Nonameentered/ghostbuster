"Tiddle flute, herald of the long reaching..." the host said, holding up a scroll and adjusting his monocle. 

The flowery dressed man sweated nervously, adjusting his sagging mushroom hat.

The crowd leaned in to see over the tapestry maker hauling ass depicting the scene. The great golden dragon towered over the others in the studio, tapping a back leg as she looked down.

The dragon shook her head,  cone hat tilted forward. She bopped the clearly human baby on her lap, hardly six months old and already with a defined six pack and head full of deep golden hair.

"You..." the host continued, making eye contact with each on stage, "are the father."

The crowd erupted with cheers and boos as the bard got up and began shuffling past security off stage.

The tapestry maker focused on the child who clutched a singed blanket, watching the crowd and sniffling.

"No, no," Gresal said, shaking his head and pulling back his long golden hair. "I misspoke. It was a potion, one of great power. That's what gave me my dragon's blood. My grandfather is wholly irrelevant."

"I heard of your grandfather," Dema said, chuckling as she spurred her horse. "The fact they called him herald of the long reaching is irrelevant, too eh?"

"Wholly, he had a very long harp. He needed to stretch very far to reach the deepest notes on it," Gresal retorted, shielding the sun with a hand as he tried to make out the settlement ahead. "We should focus on our mission to take out these bandits, not my ancestry."

"You're not helping," Dema said, laughing harder now. A bellowing trumpet of a roar came from ahead. 

"What bandits have a bloody dragon?" Gresal drew his short sword.

"I don't know, but I think you should lead on this one. We may just have to see if you take after your grandfather." Dema wiped a bit of mud off Gresal's cheek and slapped it playfully twice. "Go get em tiger. Though," she looked down at his blade. "You may need something longer than that."
