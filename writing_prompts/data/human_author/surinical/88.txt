The suburbs of Sappho-six glistened in every shade of blue, marred only by a single patch of black. The corner lot on West and Marigold.
  

  
“Crying shame, Gibby. She wasn’t even sixty, right? Young for a house. Might still be in her RMA period.” The neighbor, Paul something, spit into the still living yard. “I remember when I saw that blue floating down the road, first one of her roof feathers to go, crying shame.”
  

  
“That’s the worst part of all of this,” Gilbert said. “The doctor could never figure out why she was dying, so we never qualified for any relief programs and we can’t negotiate any kind of refund because all the forms require a cause of death with proof. There’s no way the bank will approve another loan, and there’s no way we can pay this one off.”
  

  
“Boy, rough. Anyways, be seeing ya!” Paul waddled back to his own house. He clicked gently as Paul petted his flank. Did the houses mourn each other? 
  

  
The front awning was already sagging enough, Gilbert had to duck a little to get through to the front door. He had to figure something out.
  

  
“How’s Molly?” Gilbert asked Jane. She was staring intently at something in the kitchen. The water still worked for now, but once the rot set in.
  

  
“She doesn’t want to talk yet. Still crying. No girl should have to lose her house so young.” She was stabbing something into the walls and then rubbing it on plastic sheets laid out over the counters.
  

  
“What are you doing?”
  

  
“Housebird chemical testing kit. It’s a long shot, but if I can get a hit on something, it may be enough for a cause of death.”
  

  
“The doctors already did all that.” Gilbert pulled at his hair. “How much did a kit like that cost?”
  

  
“$400,” she said. “I had to buy under the table from someone. They don’t sell these anymore. Maybe the doctor missed something, like I said, a longshot.”
  

  
“We need to start saving our money. We’re gonna end up renting and still paying down the mortgage on this place.”
  

  
“This place loved us, Gill, and I loved her too.” Jane raised her hands up and let them drop to her sides. “If there’s any chance I can figure out what happened to her, I’m gonna take it. I don’t care if I’m working overtime till Molly’s through college.”
  

  
“Okay, okay,” Gill said. “I need a drink.”
  

  
“I added in ice to the back cooler, grab from there.” She returned to work. He had his form of stress relief and she had hers.
  

  
Gill stepped through the house, once a marvel of modern bioengineering, now a macabre husk. Bits of the frame flaked off as he opened the door to the garage. How long before they had to move everything out? Before the smell started? As much as he hated Bondantu right now, their website was probably the best place to start.
  

  
“If they just didn’t sterilize them before they sold them, every house could have a happy litter. Pretty soon, everyone in America, heck, everyone on Earth could have a home, for free. But of course, the companies didn’t want that.”
  

  
“Gill! Get in here!” Jane yelled.
  

  
He tripped on a cracked stair as he rushed back to the kitchen. She was standing, arms crossed and tapping her leg. “Look! There it is, plain as day.”
  

  
He leaned over, looking at the test readout fields. White meant no chemical detected and the darker red a box was, the higher the levels detected. One box was lit up red, another so dark it was almost black.
  

  
“Strychnine, our house was poisoned,” Gill said. “Who would be sadistic enough to kill someone’s home?”
  

  
“No clue,” Jane said. “But we did it. We can start filing paperwork. I don’t even know what’s this other one, BDmHB chorionic gonadotropin, what a mouthful. The chart doesn’t explain more”
  

  
“I’m looking it up,” Gilbert said, hands shaking. “That’s impossible.”
  

  
“What?” Jane asked. “Now’s not the time to be cryptic.”
  

  
“A BDmHB chorionic gonadotropin test is done in Bondantu factories to measure the amount of the hormone in blood or urine of an unsterilized female to see if the House bird is pregnant.”
  

  
“Get the sledgehammer, Gill. We need to get to the basement,” Jane said.

Bondantu Company is facing tens of thousands of lawsuits across the United States filed by individuals who allege packets of lethal poison were secretly attached to house birds sold between 2054-2061, set to activate if the sterilization process failed and fertilized eggs were detected. The first trial against Bondantu ended on August 10, 2062 with a unanimous jury verdict of $989 million for a Ferndale, Colorado family. 
  

  
In 2063, criminal charges of animal abuse were brought against Bondantu alleging evidence of these packets found surgically implanted in the homes prior to sale. This case is ongoing. If found guilty, the company may be required by the judge to give up all patents and trademarks to House Bird technology, allowing anyone to grow, raise, and live in House Birds without fear of reprisal by Bondantu.
