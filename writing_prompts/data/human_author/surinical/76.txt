Part 7:

With each greedy step, Michael gained more speed. He approached the hill with the wagon rolling smoothly behind him, the weight feeling insignificant. As his heart raced, he could feel the hot blood pumping through his muscles, swelling and contracting as he destroyed the grass. He came to the edge and bound in a wild jump. 
  

  
As the ravine showed below him, he knew at once he wouldn’t make it, that he had been foolish even to try. What would Caleb think? That his father abandoned him, never knowing he lay dead at the bottom of the foot of an evil boat castle in some other world? 
  

  
The center grew closer and Michael spread out his paws, barely touching the hard stone on the other side. He dug in his claws as the wagon sailed over him, busting into the gate, covering it in fertilizer and bits of wood. He was still slipping, front paws scrambling over crumbling bricks, each grip weaker than the last.
  

  
He had seen a bear once with his father when they used to go camping together. Deep in the distance, Michael had spotted a brown bear climb 20 feet up an oak, straight as a rod in the time it took him to take a breath.
  

  
Michael dug his back paws into the back of the ravine and lunged up, grabbing higher and higher on the top. He finally got a back leg under him. He roared as the paws came down over his own, tearing and twisting.
  

  
The giant beast snarled and lunged out, chomping teeth sounding like a barrel busting. Michael pushed forward, ramming the beast against the black walls of the castle as it bit into his shoulder.
  

  
“Mikey, stay on its left!” Elder Pete called out. A jet of flame shot over the ravine as Michael and the beast traded blows. The fire took hold over the ruined wagon, immediately roaring into an inferno. “It won’t take long to heat it up!”
  

  
Michael swiped out, trying to knock the beast off the thin walkway of stone, but it dodged and snapped out again. He roared in frustration and bit back, ripping an ear off the thing and spitting it to fall, swaying like a wet leaf. His back was still to the rising fire. He saw no way to get on the other side of the beast. He jumped on top of it, sinking teeth deep into its haunches. 
  

  
The beast bucked up and threw Michael, sending him scrambling over the edge. He immediately dug his back feet in and jumped back up. Again he would have smiled if he could, watching the snarling thing, now framed by the white-blue blaze roaring behind it. 
  

  
The explosion was instant, flashing white and booming Michael felt deep in his chest followed by ringing. The beast started to lunge again but twitched and hung slack, panting. A spear of twisted wrought iron impaled the thing through the neck, leaving it dangling. Michael pushed and sent it tumbling down into the dark. 
  

  
Four grapples flew in perfect sync, catching on the ruined edge of the gate. The bomb had ruptured a hole through a huge section of the fortress, leaving a cross-section of the wall visible. Tar, wood, stone, then wood again. It was merely a facade of a massive ship, then. Why?
  

  
Bart crossed his rope quickly hand over hand, while both Pete’s wrapped their legs around and shimmied slowly across. He hadn’t even noticed Douglas until the nimble man had almost crossed, running along the top of the rope and jumping down to land on the rubble.
  

  
“Any scout worth his salt knows to bring twice as much rope as he thinks he might need,” Douglas said, leaning past Michael to see the blood stains of his scrap with the beast. “Planning on saving any fun for the rest of us or show we just send you in there alone?”
  

  
Michael gave his best bear shrug as the rest of the team gathered by the door.
  

  
“Like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children. When Golgotha invited me to his castle when I arrived,” Bart said, stretching, “there was a lush feast with every kind of meat you can think of and half that many again of ones you wouldn't recognize, all delicious. Just past here is that grand hall. He may be waiting for us there, beside his remaining son and the mountains of gold tribute from the many villages around. They bring their sons to sing and the daughters to dance.” Bart smiled fondly back at his family.
  

  
“I come for you!” Bart yelled through the door as he turned back forward.” I told you I'd be back! I got two of your boys, safe and sound! You want them, you got to go through me and mine.”
  

  
“This Kingdom could hardly bear the weight of one of you,” a deep bellowing voice carried from the dark inside. “Five would be its end.” 
  

  
“My thoughts exactly!” Bart yelled back as he hefted his ax and stepped over the rubble.
