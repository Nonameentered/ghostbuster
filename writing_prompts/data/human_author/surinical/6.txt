Thanks for the perspective! Very interesting! In this case, that reserve would probably be at a human hospital since the world at large believes Henderson is human. Only in desperation do they bring him to Marcel.

It could even be a plot point with people wondering why he didn't go to the traditional hospital unit reserved for him.
