\[Poem\]

&#x200B;

Echoes lost wholesale roll past

A listless current bobbing dregs

Liquid fire leaves the river glassed

I stand unfamiliar of my legs

\*\*\*

I paw for eyes and twist them in

They alight to show discarded death

Battle deemed by distant sin

Paid in brothers’ breathless breath

\*\*\*

Bit by bit, I am reforged

Scraping rust around the shear

On friend and foe, I am so gorged

I weep a wail I cannot hear

\*\*\*

I gather ears to know the din

As I work slowly south

And drape inside a lover’s skin

But prized of all, I find a mouth

\*\*\*

I limp and fall along my way

To the city of the fools

So they may see the price we pay

What war wears whet upon its tools

\*\*\*
  

  
There, the many eyed and awed
  

  
I was polished off of all my dirt
  

  
Set displayed and pinned to laud
  

  
To show all what war is worth
  

  
\*\*\*
  

  
The patriot's processions roll
  

  
Listless currents giving praise
  

  
I am historic, the nation’s soul
  

  
They keep my mouth outside the cage
