The smell of popcorn and fresh air greeted Jonathan as he stepped inside. The hat rack was curiously empty considering the crowd this evening, but he deposited his bowler just the same. How appropriate, he chuckled to himself at the seed of the joke. 

Balanced against the wall was what looked to be a worn scabbard and sword and several other accouterments he didn’t recognize. He was careful not to trip on any of them as he turned a carpeted corner into the widest interior he had seen in his twenty-eight years.

He flinched then frowned at himself. He had surely thought he was free of the post-war skitters. Not just yet, it seemed. The crash echoed across the wide expanse of the fluorescent-lit building amid a flurry of squeaks. 

“Strike!” a tall blonde man declared in triumph, shaking a bulging arm in the air, furs flitting about him. “Strike!” All he was missing was one of those winged helmets and Jonathan would have sworn he was a Viking right out of Wagner.

Jonathan politely pardoned and expertly excused himself through the listless and quite tall patrons crowding the waiting area. On tiptoe, he spotted a titular sign matching the bizarrely glowing one outside missing only the flickering lady kicking out a leg to send a line of pins flying that graced the parking lot. 

Beneath ‘Green Maiden Pin and Inn’ a lovely young lady, green a bit herself with glow caught from above, stood cranking some shoe stretching device.

“Excuse me, miss,” he said, clearing the obnoxious gravel from his voice as best he could. Perhaps it would have been better if the hellish gas had just taken him alongside Patrick and dear Curtis. Better that than force others to submit to hearing this wheezing croak. 

The young woman waited patiently for him to finish.

“Our vehicle is stranded up the road. I don’t suppose I might borrow a phone? Or if a handyman’s about that might accompany me back?”

A woman leaning on the bar to Jonathan’s right sneered in his direction, no doubt due to his voice. Her clothes were difficult to describe, in both material and cut.

“I’ll see what I can do,” the woman behind the bar said, finishing with her contraption and pouring a golden froth from tap to glass. “A drink while you wait?”

“Oh no, best I begin the night with a level head so that some might remain by its end.” He coughed. His voice did feel dry as bones. “It’s my stag night, you see. The lads are taking to a cabin up north for the weekend.”

“Then I insist,” the woman said smiling and sliding the same drink over to him. No one else at the bar seemed to take offense to this.

Another crash came as Jonathan brought the sip to his lips. He spilled none of it, thankfully. 

“Ahh!” the burly man yelled again, this time holding up and shaking his small robed partner. “A strike for you! We are the darkest devils of these games, wolves upon the hunt! The hunt for pins! Strike!”

“Hey buddy,” a starkly handsome man in a plastic jacket offered Jonathan. “What’s your friend’s number? I’ll call them?" He held up a black tile of glass and rubbed his finger on it.

"Well they're not home. They are with the car. I'm hoping to reach a mechanic in whatever the nearest town is."

"Not working in this place anyway, sorry." The curious man pocketed the object.

"I would think not, uncabled from anything as it is."

The woman behind the bar laughed before taking a pair of shoes from the burly man and reaching for her device again.

"Tell me about it. They make their batteries worse and worse every year." 

"Quite," Jonathan offered, having lost a foothold for the conversation he may have never had.

"Oh never mind," the man smiled, pulling out the tile again as it chirped like a field mouse. "Yeah I'll be right there. I couldn't find you guys! I'm in some bowling alley." 

"Miss?" Jonathan asked again is the man worked back through the crowd.

The pretty woman held up an inquisitive eyebrow as she continued to work on the shoes.

"I do hate to trouble you again but have you worked here long?"

"Now that sounds remarkably like a pickup line for a man about to be married," she smiled as Jonathan's cheeks blushed from east to west.

"Oh, I meant no such thing. My apologies, I only-"

"I'm messing with you," she said, setting the shoes in a cubby aside a thousand brothers. "I've worked here my whole life."

"Why is it that the guests here all seem so peculiar in so many varied ways?"

"They're lost, in one way or another. This is a place you can only find when you're looking for something else, someone else, some when else."

"Hmm," he offered.

"Do you love your wife to be?"

"Of course I do!" Jonathan barked reflectively. "What kind of question is that? I mean I haven't spent a great deal of time with her but I'm sure once we're settled we'll…"

Another thin eyebrow begged. "You'll what?"

"Get along quite well. It's a matter of responsibility more than anything."

"There's more than one way a man might be lost," she said. A phone rang beneath the bar and she picked it up, balancing it between her ear and shoulder. She said nothing into the receiver as she nodded.

"And that was your friends. They managed to make their way into town and find a mechanic. They're asking to meet you back at the car. Think you can find your way back?"

"I do believe so, yes." He pulled out his wallet from his jacket pocket.

"You've already paid in full, friend," she said, grabbing his wrist. Her hand was cold as winter ground. "War wears it whet upon its tools and grinds to nubs the bravest fools."

"Indeed," Jonathan said, not sure if she was paying him a compliment or an insult. He pulled away and worked towards the door. "Thank you."

"Anytime you need us again, just don't come looking." The door slammed loudly behind him. He didn't flinch.

He began the thoughtful walk back to the car alongside a dark but straight, unforking road. Jonathan debated the path all the same.
