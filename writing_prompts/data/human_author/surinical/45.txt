"A curse?" Jamie laughed as he rolled through the swirling river of light. He was finally getting the hang of this. A particularly thick cluster of the strange black shelves clotted the port into the machine. 

He couldn't even remember what he had done to upset the techno witch that sent him to this Eden. Did it really matter if she was dumb enough to think this was a curse?

He kicked them away and let himself be sucked into the file, a movie in a tropical paradise. The sun felt warm on his skin. A group of college kids celebrated the drunken game of volleyball in the distance. Had he dated a girl that played volleyball? He thought so but he couldn't remember her name.

Jamie wrinkled his nose and headed through the port again, falling into another file. Atmospheric noir music played as he walked down a dirty city street. A passing taxi splashed mud onto the sidewalk. A woman in an expensive dress clutched her purse and stepped through a door, a PI's office perhaps?

He chuckled and stepped back, falling and twisting into a different type of file.

He was inside the cockpit of a space fighter, lasers already blazing against some fleshy looking organic ship trying to pivot around him. "Glory!" An automatic voice yells as he scored a kill.

"Okay, now we're talking."

After a few hours he stepped back again, clearing another clump of the strange black shelves, before recoiling back. One of them had the face of a man. It started up at Jamie, disinterested. "Fresh, eh?" it croaked. "I would tell you to leave this place, but I won't bother. That's what they told another boy, a long time ago."

Jamie tossed the bizarre thing down with disgust. It crawled slowly with half fingers at the edge of the box shape. It scraped the ground until it reached the port and  fell into a file and disappeared.

Maybe he would go back to the beach. He could use something light after that.
