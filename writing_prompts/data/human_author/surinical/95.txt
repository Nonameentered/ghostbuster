Part 2:

Stepping inside the stone-walled building, the smell and sizzle of frying meat and potatoes awakened Michael’s stomach. The dirt floor was packed hard and hardly anyone besides them were wearing shoes. The clanging of metal cookware battled with servers and cooks yelling incomprehensible orders at each other as they hustled about. A man in one of the booths was shaking a finger at two others, looking like it might come to blows.

“Gentleman,” a pretty woman with sunken eyes said. Her blouse above her corset was stained and dripping with whatever was sloshing from the mugs she carried. “Take one of the six tops in the back. We’ll be there as soon as we can.”

“It’s like a medieval waffle house,” Michael said, craning his neck around as they walked to a free table.

“Hah, exactly!” his father said, clapping him on the back. “You were always good with describing things. Say, did you end up being a lawyer?”

“Accountant,” Michael answered. “Law school wasn't practical. I had to stay home with mom and help her after high school.”

“Right, yeah,” he said, pulling out a seat at the table. “Look, I’m not trying to explain it all away here. I know your life sucked after I disappeared, the same as mine did. Can we just start over, no expectation? You can even call me Pete, if you’d prefer. This is a real roll with the punches kinda situation, it seems.”

They all sat. The waxed tabletop was sticky. Michael moved to wipe his hand on the bandage on his head. It was gone.

“Welcome to Micheal, the last of us. Five generations of Hartfield. The time has come to prepare.” The oldest man said, in appearance and lineage. He reached down.

“Wait for a second, Bart. I promised I’d explain what we knew first,” Pete said. “This here, son, this whole world, is like the plate you put under your chili bowl to catch the drippings.”

“Elsewhere,” his grandfather said. “Your great, great grandfather found himself here by happenstance.”

“Took a wrong turn in a fever deviled dream, I did,” Bart said.

“Right, assuredly,” Grandfather continued. “I’m Douglas, by the way. Bart here, upset a man that fancies himself the barbarian king of this land, Golgotha the Gorger.”

The chaos of the tavern stilled and several guests and employees glared at them. A broken plate broke the spell and the clanging resumed.

“Superstitious bunch, these,” Pete said. “Tell him what you did to get him so red assed at ya, Bart.”

“Superstitious is wise in a world such as this,” Bart cracked his neck left and right, tensing thick muscles. “I killed his son, didn’t know him from Adam at the time, of course. Only that he was beating a girl half to death. I didn’t mean to kill him, just get him off her. His skull came apart like a gourd.”

A man bumped into Michael’s side as he drunkenly shuffled past. Michael flinched in expectation, but no pain came. He tapped his ribs and breathed in deep. He felt like he could run a marathon. Even his back didn’t hurt.

“This world affects us in a way it doesn’t for others that find themselves here, you see.” Bart beat his chest once, producing a deep clap. “Worked for me, and all my descendants so far. By the gleam in your eye, I’d say you have it too. You see the demon?”

“The smokeshow wearing mud, he means,” Pete said.

“Yes,” Michael answered. “She put a cloth on my head.”

“That’s the secret, I think and one, Gol- let's call him Skull, may not know,” Douglas added. “No one else here has any inkling who that lady is. Just us.”

“So this Skull guy cursed you for killing his son, I’m guessing when he was sixteen, now we all show up here too when our sons turn sixteen as revenge. So, how do we get out?”

“We bust into his castle, raise a little Hell, praise a little Dale, and take his little magic statue.” Pete grinned ear to ear.

Memories rushed back of watching racing with his Dad. He had liked it, then, he remembered. Couldn’t stand it now.

“It was the means of the curse’s origin,” Bart said. “He rubbed a wetted finger upon its brow and spoke his wish and it was so. With that in our possession, we can hopefully, each return home.”

“We each have grown stronger in different ways in this place,” Douglas said, holding up a hand that became first transparent and then fully invisible. “I managed to thrift 5 sets of armor and weapons from a passing merchant, providence or luck has seen them all fit so far, one left for you.”

“So, is this like a battle an army of undead hordes situation, or more of a heist kinda deal?” Michael asked.

“Skull and his four sons reside in the castle proper, each bedeviled with wicked strength,” Bart said, clenching a fist. “There are guards, dogs, traps, but we will die starving in our seats before any of that comes to issue, it seems! Barmaid! Service!”

“Piss off!” a couple of the kitchen crew yelled in unison. The tavern erupted in laughter.

“Great great granddad’s a bit of a Karen, eh?” Michael said.

The table looked at him clueless.

“Nevermind, so, what are we waiting on? I have a Chevy to pick up they're only holding for me for one day. Let's gear up and get to it.”

Bart reached into a long pocket that reached all down his legs, pulling out a scroll and unrolling it dramatically on the table. It was a sketched map.

“This is the best we could make with Bart’s memory of the castle and my scouting,” Douglas said. “We have the crew, but we need ways to handle and get past the defenses.”

“So, a heist, got it.” Michael said.

“Alright, what are gentlemen drinking, we got Ale, good cider, bad cider, soursap, krinf, demf, and paddylocks wine.”

“Ale,” the man at the end of the table said, his Great Grandfather. Michael forgot he was there.

“Ale all around,” Pete said, leaning over to Michael. “Believe me, it ain’t bud, but you do not want to try anything else, believe me.”
