The tropical seascape rolled with a gentle breeze coming down the mountain, carrying the scents of Pina colada and sunscreen to John's nostrils. 

He let out a contented sign in his hammock, deciding what he should do for the last day of vacation. There were cavern tours, horseback rides, and a volcano exploration he could try. That last one would never be possible if this weren't a simulated vacation. Lawsuits galore.

Another thought occurred to him. It didn't have to be his last day. Getting fired from that accounting firm might have been the best thing to ever happen to him.

He could spend today renewing his contract instead, his body toiling in a factory somewhere automatically while he sat cozy in his mind, enjoying this paradise. Maybe he would even work down the catalog. Aspen, Tokyo, there had been a lot of really good options. The Caribbean might have been the uninspired choice.

"Another Margarita?" A beautiful woman asked, flowing dress leaving light patterns in the soft sand around her feet. She held out a tray, moving in time with his gentle swaying. He would bet she was an amazing dancer.

"Actually, I think I'll try a negroni if you have one." 

The drink changed to red. "Huh," he had never actually seen one before. It didn't look very appetizing. He took a sip.

He was standing in a dark room. The cool island breeze had been replaced with stale chemicals. He was painfully scrubbing his arms in the sink as pink water circled the drain. It was his own face staring back at him in the mirror, so flawed compared to the avatar he'd chosen for himself in the vacation package.

He had no control as he stepped back and turned with jerking, efficient movements. The bathroom was covered in blood. He tried to yell but had no vote in his voice.

He stepped silently into the main room, blinds pulled across the windows letting in just enough light to make out the two perfectly made twin beds to the left, the coffee machine and it's mini accoutrements on a table to the right and six black trash bags sitting on a tarp in the middle of the floor.

"Not a fan I take it?" The woman's laugh was as pretty as her. John could smell the lilacs in her hair. Was that even a tropical plant?

"I think the vacation is malfunctioning. I just saw something really strange."

"Oh no," she said with perfectly calibrated customer service tone. "What happened?" Her eyes looked down at him with just a hint of intensity.

"I saw myself, I mean I was in my real body but I wasn't in control. I was washing my hands in a bathroom." John carefully dismounted the hammock and stood. The breeze gave him a small shiver.

"Alright, I do apologize for that, and can authorize an additional payment bonus to compensate for your uncomfortable time. Did you see anything else? Other than washing your hands in the bathroom?"

John hesitated. "No, I washed my hands and then I was back here. I was scrubbing too hard though, I'm afraid it'll scratch my skin."

"Don't worry about that, sensory perception is often skewed in the rare event of a glitch where the vacation simulation reboots. The autonomous programs aren't capable of hurting you or anyone else. You probably just spilled something on yourself at the factory we have you working in and they wanted to get you clean as quickly as possible."

"Right," John said, sitting the drink back on her tray.

"Now," she said with a devilish smile. "Let's get back to what really important, your vacation." She swayed her hips and let the rhythm carry slowly down to her toes. "Do you want to dance with me by the bar?"

"No," John said, smiling politely. "I think I'm going to head down to the street market, get a bite to eat."

"I'll go with you," she offered cheerfully. Not a question, he noticed. "Are you going to renew your stay in the port office while you're down there?"

"I was considering it," John said, thinking about the blank look on his face and also of that pile of black bags in what clearly wasn't a factory but a hotel room. "Maybe not."

His escort bobbed beside him as they worked their way down the grass lined cobblestones. A red and blue parrot sat in a coconut tree above them. It opened its beak and produced the sound of a camera shutter.

"What'll it be, young man," the muscly mustached man asked. The giant skillet in front of him sizzled with various meats that he worked over with a spatula and knife, timed perfectly like a percussion accompaniment to the light music pervading the island.

"Ox tongue, if you have it. Ox tongue tacos." John almost gagged just saying the name.

"Interesting choice but it's your vacation," the man said, tipping his tall chef's hat. "What better time to live on the wild side?"

From the impossibly varied stack of meat, he pulled out a long browned shaft. John tried not to look at the still visible taste buds along one side as the man began to chop.

A few seconds later, he scooted a plate forward. Cilantro and lime rested atop the seasoned meat. Even better, John thought and swallowed his spit.

John took a step away from the woman, winced to prepare himself, and took a bite.

"241 Buena Vista parkway, two men, one woman, anyone else watching," a man said on the cell phone pressed to John's ear using his shoulder, a trick he'd never been able to master himself. One hand was on the steering wheel, guiding masterfully around the curves of a dirt road. The other hand held something heavy just out of view.

"Understood, finishing the last assignment now."

John strained as hard as he could and managed to turn the head a few inches to the right, causing the cell phone to drop into his lap. His head jerked back defiantly to the road but he had seen the woman, bound and gagged in the passenger seat. He had also seen the pistol he held pressed against her temple.

"Maybe a little too adventurous?" The man behind the cooking pan asked. "Want to swap it out for a cheeseburger?"

"Actually I think I've lost my appetite," John said, managing to smile back at the pair staring back at him. "Thanks anyway."
