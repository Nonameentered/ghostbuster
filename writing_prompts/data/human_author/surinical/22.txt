Thank you for the kind words, friend! I actually came up with the title and the idea for the cover art before the overstory concept when I realized how cool it would be for the eggs themselves to be individual stories.

I was also inspired by the 1951 Ray Bradbury collection the illustrated Man, where each tattoo on the man's body represents a story.
