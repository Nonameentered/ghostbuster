"Babe, it's your turn."

"Yep, I'm going, I'm going," Marcus said, rolling out of bed as the thumping above them continued. He had thought getting the apartment on the top floor would be great.

Ever since the cordyceps pandemic, that was certainly not the case. He sleepily stumbled through the kitchen, digging through the junk draw to find the funnel and tossed it in the bucket.

His back popped as he reached under the sink, coming up with the industrial fungicide. He managed to not split his pants but just barely. He just bought these pajamas. "I really have to start that diet."

He added some water to the bucket and carefully measured out the chemical. The banging got louder and he splashed in another glug for good measure.

"Now where did I leave the... Bingo." He picked up the Super soaker and filled the tank. He made the mistake of looking at the clock, 4 a.m. He only had two more hours if he got back to sleep at all.

He popped into the hallway and shuffled up the stairs to the roof. The cool breeze felt nice, up so high.

"This one's full, buddy," a man said as he opened the door. His cheeks, purplish red, almost glowed in the moonlight. His face was pressed against the tarred rooftop, facing the other way.

Marcus stepped over a few of the displayers, careful not to trip on any of the discarded pants until he got to a good position.

"Okay, folks, show's over." He pumped the water gun and begin spraying the raised butts of the congregation. They squirmed and scattered like roaches as the sizzling mixture off gased into the night.

"What the hell, guy!" one of the infected yelled, looking like he hadn't slept in days. Marcus directed another shot at the guy's mouth, sending him scurrying down the fire escape with the rest.

He proudly looked over the roof, cleared of displayers. "It really is a nice night."

He felt a tingle of pleasure to look over the edge and see how high he was. Maybe he would just spend a few hours up here, no big deal. 

He kicked off his pajamas and pressed his head against the ground, breathing a sigh of total bliss.
