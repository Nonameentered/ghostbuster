Part 5:

Gunfire rang with deep echoes through the tunnel. Each of Sader and Paradise’s shots found a target, ripping bouncing monstrosities violently apart in several pieces. The creatures piling and tumbling over each other looked like inside-out rabbits. Exploding actually made them a bit more palatable.

“Step aside, whoever you are!” the tall man yelled from the street. The strange ribbons danced around behind him, long as swords almost scratching the oddly shaped robed figures beside him. He didn’t have the gun but was holding something else. Something red and wet. “I just want the boy.”

Sader answered with a pistol shot. One of the dancing blades curved to ricochet the bullet. Pain jerked Tina’s leg up. One of the rabbit things was stuck there, shaking its small head back and forth, pinprick teeth sunk above her ankle.

“You sure you want me?” Gabe asked, staring at the man. “Hemoglobin–oxygen affinity is described by a sigmoid-shaped dissociation curve with the normal value in humans of 26.7 millimeters mercury. Zero would be quite unlikely.”

Tina kicked and batted at the slimy thing, finally managing to punt it down the hill. A bloodstain was growing on her jeans above the ache. One hopper jumped at Gabe, flying through and landing confused behind him before joining five more of the things hopping toward Tina with excited insect-like chittering.

The tall man coughed. He was bent over wheezing, face turning blue. One of the other figures burst into galloping motion, its robes falling off behind it. It looked like a beefy horse with a set of long, almost human arms jutting from either side of the shoulders. More of the hoppers plopped and fell from holes along its belly as it ran.

Paradise somehow pulled out a birdcage from inside her suit and chucked it at the approaching monster as Gabe faltered and ran back toward the agents. The cage exploded in a cloud of gas that surrounded the horse creature, who tripped and fell as the cloud thickened into something like dry clay. Bits of the grey shell shattered as more hoppers pushed their way out.

Tina pulled out the watch just as the rabbits were almost on her. It popped up and out of her sweaty grip. It rolled down and out of sight in the grass between her and the still approaching figures. The tall man was sprawled on the ground now, the red thing he had carried spreading a gaping mouth over his head.

“Shit,” she yelled as she charged through the nibbling creatures, too numerous to count. They were practically marching out of the clay-encased horse creature now. Gabe was steadying himself as he hovered and threw chaotic lightning bolts at the horde alongside the agents still shooting. A stray bolt landed just in front of Tina and she jumped back.

Another burst of pain came as one of the hoppers bit her good leg. Her knees buckled and she tripped, sending her falling down the hill. She scrambled to catch herself at the bottom. The grass was fake, she realized, like thin green plastic. She craned her neck up to see the tall man standing again, skin bloodless grey. The red wet blob had fully covered his head. It was eyeless but the curling muscles almost made a grimacing expression. It smelled like a garbage disposal.

“The Ignis Fatuus will tip the scales,” the blob gurgled from lips wrapped around the man’s neck. “After this distraction, we will see the whistle of the unfleshed unmade and set us all true upon the path to the Great Absence.” Two of the ribbon swords behind the puppeted man curled with vibrating effort like scorpion tails.

Tina threw up her hands in pointless protection before spotting a gleam amidst the plastic grass. She dove for it. As the blades came down, she clicked the button on the watch. The process felt like flossing every tooth at once. The sensation spread through her entire body. The swords tinked off of her back. She couldn’t move her neck to see what she looked like but she could feel her hair standing straight up. The watch in her frozen hand ticked in alternating tones.

After a couple more failed attempts Tina could hardly feel, the tall man and blob joined behind the two remaining figures in gliding up the hill. Bits of undulating tentacles showed under their robes. The hoppers stayed clear of them.

The three on the hill directed their fire at the two figures but had no obvious effect. Sader poured some liquid into the barrel of his gun before resuming shooting. The shots resonated with loud claps as they connected with the still-approaching group.

Gabe said something Tina couldn’t hear and an explosion rocked the tunnel. When the dust cleared, each of the robed figures held one of the agents and the swords of the tall man slid in lazy circles in front of Gabe's face.

The watch in Tina’s hand rang like an alarm clock and a pop accompanied an itching feeling retracting back to her teeth. She was up and running before she decided what she would do.

“You must learn, misguided, how the Chasm is to be served,” the blob said to Gabe as hoppers tried and failed to bite him. “Place your mind clear of thought to the ground.”

Gabe did so and began to convulse instantly. The hoppers swarmed him, fangs out. They no longer phased through him. He started to scream.

Tina ran a little further up the hill and swung off one of the fake trees, wrapping her legs around the tall man’s neck. One of the blades slashed through her upper arm, so sharp she hardly felt it. She grabbed wet handfuls of the soft blob and yanked up, pulling it like taffy. As soon as she felt it unlatch, she clicked the watch button again. That sensation spreading from her teeth came as she fell on her back with a deep heavy thud.

She watched as her hands turned to white pearlescent stone, clutched around the blob. It writhed but was unable to break the grasp. She saw the other side of the watch with another engraving: ‘P.S. Don’t forget to brush.’

The robed figure holding Paradise released her, either moving to grab Gabe struggling to crawl from the pile of hoppers, or to help the trapped blob. Tina would never know which as it fell to the ground unmoving after a single step, revealing Paradise behind blowing the smoke off of some small needle-looking device.

The blob tore bits of itself off to pull out from Tina’s grasp and flew through the air. It latched onto Paradise sending her sprawling back.

“You fight the inevitable, little titan,” the blob belched as it inched toward her head. “Your world and its maggots are no more than amoebas sulking in pond scum to us. Nothing from this plane can stop us.”

“My thoughts exactly,” Paradise said, whipping her hair forward and sending the glass shards onto the blob, which sizzled as it screamed.

She hurriedly pulled a coin from her pocket and flipped it. It landed in the grass.

“And what was that?” the blob asked after it tackled her again, opening its maw to cover her head.

“A lie, most likely,” she answered, struggling and failing to hold the thing back.

A great white light filled the tunnel, so bright Tina saw nothing. Her skin returned to normal as the watch rang, only to let her feel the blistering heat that accompanied it.

In a moment, it faded enough for her to see if she didn’t look near the bright sun to her right. Prickles of warmth covered her arm as the slash there began to complain as well. The blob turned and screamed before dissolving into dust. The hoppers fell to dust next, twenty at a time then hundreds, then all of them. The two figures charged towards the light but were dusted just as quickly, robes floating up and twisting in the nowhere breeze.

The light dimmed more and more until Tina could see the source of the light. A perfectly white figure floated up the hill. It had wings that branched in fractal patterns than made Tina’s eyes hurt.

Gabe sat bleeding, struggling to get to his feet as the new figure approached. It held out a glowing hand to him. He hesitated, looking at Paradise first then down to Tina. He tapped his fist twice on his chest, the greeting from some forgotten game they had made up as kids. He took the figure’s hand. Another burst of light, thankfully shorter this time, and both were gone.
