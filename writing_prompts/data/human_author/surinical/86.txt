Part 5:

“Welcome back, boys,” Douglas said, sitting on the leaning crossbeam of the barn, searing up some meat on a campfire. “By the smell of things, you found your shit.”

“Had to wet it a bit to pack it tighter,” Pete the Elder said. “Should be ready once it dries.”

“Good thing it's getting hot as balls today. And how’s it hanging with you, Mikey?” Dad asked. His armor shined so bright it was hard to look at.

“He needs healing,” Pete the Elder said. “We ran into a southern sortie of archers, didn’t take kindly to us running around with one of these wagons. Mikey took all the arrows for me.”

“Tough son of a bitch, after all,” Bart said, cords of his neck rippling as he did pull-ups on the rafters. He had painted his face blue somehow. “Shouldn’t have doubted ya, boy.”

“Bleeding stopped,” Michael managed. “Still hurts.”

“I see pops rubbed off on you,” Douglas said. “We can’t have two laconic fellows though so I’m gonna need Chatbox Mikey to head on back, when he’s available.”

“I healed fast before, not sure what changed,” Michael said.

“That's what happens when a proper fan of American Stock Car Racing gets his mitts on you,” Dad said. “Part of the kit that gorgeous red maiden blessed me with. Come here.”

Michael winced as he limped out of the wagon seat. His father grabbed him in a tight hug. His hands on the back of Michael’s head were hot, almost enough to be painful but not quite.

"I just pray that you’ll be wise in putting the car at the right place at the right time and be able to drive with wisdom.”

The heat spread, seeping into Michael. Once in school, a person showed them guided meditation. She had said to imagine your breath as traveling all through your body, past your lungs down to swirl in your toes. He swore he had almost felt it. This was like that, but stronger.

“Same thing twice,” Bart said. “Men riding around in circles ain’t nothing to lean your soul on besides.”

“I done told ya, you're riding the fog line already,” Dad said. “We’ll have it out after we finish the mission. You and me. Hush up in the meanwhile.”

Bart smirked and continued his workout without a reply.

Michael wiped his eyes after his Dad let him go. He looked down at him, the tall son of a bitch.

“Take down your first man back there, didn’t you?” Dad asked. “I looked the same way as you after I had to floss a man’s guts with a bayonet.”

His head came apart like a gourd. “Yeah.” Michael said. Dad clapped him on the back again, squeezed, and let him go.

Pete patted Michael on the back as he passed.

“How’d your mission go?” Michael asked his father.

“Thing’s got a little weird but alls well that ends well,” Dad said.

Douglas held up a long pan flute, pipes alternating shining black and creamy white. “It seems a fair bit of the secret sauce is in the player, not the tool itself but I’m picking up quickly. Sadly, the previous owner isn’t available for lessons.”

“Notice how it's not a question of how my job went,” Bart said, letting himself fall to his feet. “Just peachy, if any were doubting. I got both boys snugged up tight and I sent Daddy a big message. Best we get our armor on and roll out, wouldn’t want to miss our date with the pit.”

“Oh, Mikey, no go on armor for you. Just keep behind us,” Douglas said.

Michael handed him back his dagger. “That armor is mine, the big stuff, pretty sure at least, the teeth too.”

“That so?” Douglas said. “I’ve gotta see this.”

“I’m gonna need some help putting it on.” Michael shook out his arms as the rest of the men gathered around him, save Pete the Elder who was standing with the horses.

“What exactly are we watching for here?” Bart said. “Looks like your about to break out in song.”

It was like trying to pee in at a crowded line of urinals. He could feel the beast in there, wanting to come out.

His head came apart like a gourd. The phrase brought back the memory of the coppery blood on his tongue, the meat inside almost sweet. Nausea came in a wave pushing the beast back, but only for a second. He couldn’t stop it now if he wanted to. The transformation felt like purging. Michael roared.

“Holy shit!” Dad said. “Damn son, can we trade? You’re a goddamn werebear. I figured you were just gonna grow big muscles or something, goddamn.”

“Looks like I’ll have a partner on the frontline after all,” Bart said. “Alright boys, you heard him,  let's decorate this christmas tree.”

\*\*\*

The sun hung late morning high, cooking the steaming bricks of bat shit in front of Michael. He tried pulling ahead of the horses as they made their way down the winding road to the castle of the Gorger but turns out horses don't enjoy galloping towards a bear larger than them in clanking armor.

So, the rear it was, watching his fathers on the top compartment hastily added on by Douglas with it's long bent barn nails sticking out the sides.

"Whoa," Pete the Elder said. Michael pushed his paws in front of him. The amount of momentum he had to cancel took a while. With what felt to him like a light tap, he knocked the wagon, rocking the men up top.

"Hey there, Baloo!" Dad called down. "If you send us falling into this here cabin, we won't be any fun to sit next to at dinner tonight.”

Michael huffed and looked across the gorge, in the middle of a clearing of trees, a wide black structure stood, dotted with smoking bonfires. With wide curving towers forming a bow and stern, it looked more like a massive boat than a castle.

"A tebah of gopherwood with many qinniym, covered inside and out with pitch kofer." Bart said, voice deep and slow. "We're here, boys, and it looks like they're expecting us.
