"Forty cakes! I will accept nothing less!"

"Pundertaker, get out of here!"  Chanadh screamed, climbing out of the rubble. 

"Oh, so you will acknowledge me, hero!" The villain explained, tripping over the curb. He held a giant bee on the end of the leash like a balloon. "Just cooked up this one this morning, can you guess?" 

He waggled a finger at the stinger, shaped like the letter A.

"Listen, I know we have fun," the hero said, checking to see if the bandage she applied to her leg had stopped the bleeding. "There's another villian here, someone serious. This isn't headline bait. He's killing people."

"I think you'll find I can be deadly serious," Pundertaker said, dramatically stepping to the side, revealing nothing. "Darn, he must be late. It's not like he has to worry about traffic."

"Well if you won't leave, at least get behind me."

Black smoke oozed up from the sewer congealing into the shape of a man. "This city will still serve the great Absence," came a voice bubbling and wet. "I will see it done."

Chanadh let out a high pitched song of defense, shielding the front of the bakery. Those horrible tendrils came out of the man again and lunged out cracking against the shield. Civilians screamed as they scattered.

"I'm going to try to lure him out of the city. I can't hold him back much longer." She pulled Pundertaker and his stupid spelling bee behind her. 

"It is inevitable, the time beyond time," the boiling blackness squelched. "The Chasm God shall wear his hollow smile atop the final nadir. It is shown." Five more tendrils launched forward bursting the song shield apart.

Chanadh frantically begin chanting the song of Spears aiming for the eyes or where the eyes would be. The tendril snaked toward her, aimed for her heart. It didn't matter, as long as she took this bastard with her. 

Her Spears flew straight through seeming to not even distract the villain but she felt no pain. The tendril had bounced off a thick metal letter B. The bee was shooting more stingers, each connecting with the sharp edge of a tendril.

"It's a spelling bee, get it?" Pundertaker explained proudly from the top of a Volvo outside.

"You will fall first, and you will die slowest," the black smoke said, rolling towards the Pundertaker, drawing its hands up informing a black orb above itself.

A skateboard crashed through the body of the evil abomination, shattering its form. The rider did a flip kick and turned its cap backwards as it rolled back and chomped down at what remained of the ghostly thing's head with long reptile snout.

Chanadh stood flabbergasted as the Pundertaker directed this alligator man looking character to finish each tendril, blowing all evidence of the foul thing away.

"He's just a gator boy," the childish villain exclaimed proudly. "He said see you later boy." He hopped off the roof of the car falling face first. The bee buzzed towards him, placing a soft letter J to cushion his face.

"I'm fine I'm fine!"

"How did you do that?" Chanadh yelled. "I've been fighting that thing all morning. I couldn't touch it."

The Pundertaker smiled then, a gleam of intelligent understanding behind his eyes she hadn't seen before. "Don't think you can distract me, hero. I've come for forty things, and I won't leave here without them." 

The alligator kicked up his skateboard and folded his arms beside him. The conjuration looked nowhere near powerful enough to do what she had seen it do.

Was he so much more powerful than he seemed and all this was a comfortable game he liked to play? Would that even make him a villain at all?

Chanadh smiled despite herself. "You'll never have these cakes, villian!" She began the Song of Shields.
