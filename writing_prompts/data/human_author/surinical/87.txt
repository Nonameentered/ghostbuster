Part 4:

Early morning light outlined hanging dust motes as the rays split through broken boards. It struck Michael that he had missed an entire night's sleep and he wasn't the least bit tired. Running on adrenaline, he guessed. He doubted he could sleep if he tried.

"Yeah, that;s not gonna work for me," he said, holding up a piece of the armor that looked like it was made for a sumo wrestler. He almost couldn't lift the chest piece. "And what kind of weapon is this? It looks like metal dentures."

"Yeah, we all expected you to be very fat," Douglas said. "I guess it was just luck that it worked out for the rest of us, sorry. Take one of my daggers. I'll be on the lookout for more though, what are you, a size 36 waist?"

"Yep," Micheal answered, pocketing the blade. "But I doubt you're going to find a tag on whatever you come across."

"Hah, I like you, Michael, you and my son both. No stick up your asses at all, very proud. Now, this is where we part ways. Bart's already fucked off, I think. Not a fan of my secret hideout."

Michael started to climb back into the carriage as his father practiced with a warhammer on the ruined walls of the old barn.

"Whoa," Pete the Elder said. "It'll look odd, two men up front. Best you get back in the carriage."

Michael stepped back, managing to figure out the strange latch on the door after some trial and error. The inside reeked of cigars. He admonished himself for being surprised the windows didn't roll down.

He took the time during the quiet ride to reflect. Maybe he stroked out in the hallway and this was all some morphine fueled dream in the ER. Was that really less likely than the prospect that he was transported to a fantasy world with four generations of fathers?

The argument didn't sway him. He wanted to do this. Real or symbolized by a fantastical fever dream, he wanted to fight. Be back with Dana and Caleb. He would do anything, including steal a magical artifact from a barbarian king.

The wagon slowed and came to a stop. Peter was speaking to someone. Michael opened one of the curtains slightly. You can see a silo in the distance, beyond a cultivated field, but whoever was talking was directly in front of the wagon.

They had hoped that the fertilizer would be unattended, or at least whoever was here wouldn't give them too much trouble. Surely manure thievery wasn't that common of a practice, but he guessed he didn't know. He vaguely remembered reading something about guano being very valuable before modern fertilizer.

The man shouted, followed by what sounded like three or maybe even five other men shouting. Michael didn't hear Peter's voice in the cacophony. He debated for a moment whether he should remain hidden, but great granddad might be in trouble. He kicked open the door, drawing the dagger.

He was greeted by the smoking corpse of a soldier, half his face burnt away, leaving him with a grizzly smile. "Holy shit," Michael said, tripping from the carriage.

"Nobody knows the trouble I've seen," Peter was standing by the horses, singing to them softly. Two more dead bodies sizzled in the road in front of him.

"Nobody knows my sorrow, Nobody knows the trouble I've seen Glory, Hallelujah, shh, girl, here's a good girl."

"Um, Peter?" Michael said, just above a whisper. "What happened?"

"Those men are soldiers, stationed in the city to the South, part of another kingdom. They recognized the carriage as belonging to someone from there, I reckon. They wouldn't let us pass. Farm's right there."

"Okay, all that makes sense, but what did you do to them? Do you have a flamethrower hiding back there somewhere?"

"I worked with the flamethrower crews for a while before I got moved to Supply logistics. The Japanese would retreat into these little caves, and it was the burners job to burn them out. Problem was, it was almost never just soldiers hiding in there. You'd yell, begging for them to come out first, but they never did, not till the fire started, sometimes not even then. We couldn't go in after them, booby trapped. We just listened to 'em till they stopped," Pete stopped talking, staring into the middle distance. "You know what I think this place is?"

"What's that?" Michael turned to see a group of at least twenty men walking up the road. "Pete, we may want to hustle or hide."

"I think it's hell, simple as that. Eternal damnation, the lands beyond the eyes of God. Kind of like Da said, but it ain't just his sins we're paying for, it's mine too, all mixed together in a big old pot."

Pete held out his hand and stepped away from the horses. "It can't hurt me no more. I was always so afraid of it, but it can't hurt me no more." His hand erupted in a gout of flame, forming a cone 8ft in front of him and about 2 ft wide.

The men started marching faster. "Shit, Pete, they've seen us! What's the plan?"

"Maybe they just want to chat," Pete said slowly, still not looking away from the tree he'd just set fire to. "Complain about that man on the radio saying we're all going blindfold into an abyss, lest we get us some of that reform." He said it like REform, it reminded Michael of something he couldn't place.

"Okay, up to me," Michael walked as non-threatening as he could towards the road.

"Halt!" One of the men almost on them said. "Address thy God!"

"Hey!" Michael said, raising his hands up. "My friend's having a really bad day over there. Can we just-AH!"

Pain like Michael had never felt exploded in his leg. An arrow was lodged there, shaft at least 3 ft long. He was frozen, just staring at it. Another arrow sank into his stomach. Without conscious decision, he was running back towards the wagon.

Arrows rained down all around him, thudding into the dirt like hail. The wind knocked out of him as he felt two more pins of white hot pressure stab into his back. His legs gave out under him as another volley started to fall.

Bit of overkill, don't you think? He wanted to say but he had no voice. Run Pete, he also wanted to say. You'll be termite wood before you get your burners on em.

Another arrow struck his leg. Still hurt. Why the fuck am I not dead yet? He managed only to groan, coming out like a horse growl of an animal, as he coughed up black blood onto dirt in front of him.

He groaned again and tried to scream. At some point, he must have turned back towards the men. They were watching him backing away slowly. You tried to reach to pull the arrow out of his leg but his fingers were clumsy, useless.

He was running towards the men, roaring. At least he didn't have to worry about feeling this pain much longer. Surely, they would kill him. But the archers broke formation, scattering away from him in every direction.

Michael focused on one and chased after him. Somehow despite his injurirs, despite his pain, he was running faster then he ever had, with huge bounding strides. He reached out of hand, closed the gap and swiped at the man's back, tearing through the leather armor.

He toppled him over and roared down at him, so small and frail. The bones in his arms snapped like twigs under Michael's holding him down. He reached down and bit the man's face. What had Bart said? It came apart like a gourd.

Michael craned neck and look around, he had to reposition his legs to see behind him. The men were almost out of sight back down the sudden road.

"Michael, is that you in there?" Pete asked, small hand outstretched towards him, stepping into the road. Curiously, Michael saw his khakis and t-shirt, bloody and ripped on the road. Was he naked? How embarrassing.

Of course it's me, Michael wanted to say, but he had no voice, only croaking grunts came out. He nodded instead.

Pete put his hand down, sighing out. "Good Lord, you could have warned a man before you did that, you know. Can you change back?"

Change back? What was he talking about? Michael look down, confused. Too thick pillars of brown fur were there ending in long black claws.

Change back! Change back! Change back! What the hell. Michael reared up on two legs. He was taller than some of the trees.

"Easy, big guy," Pete said sitting down in the road. "Don't get stressed. Bad men are gone. You took care of em, nobody's going to hurt ya. Just look at me, okay? We're going to take it easy and sit here and breathe and take it real easy."

Easy. Easy. Came apart easy, easy like a gourd. Don't think about it. Don't think about it. Don't think "about it. Don't think about it." Michael breathed in and sat, looking down at distinctly human legs. He was indeed naked, except for his socks, tattered remnants still attached to his ankles.

"There ya go," Pete said, standing. "You ruined your shirt and trousers but you can wear my cloak if you want to keep somewhat decent."

"Thank you," Michael said, voice hoarse and deep. "But just to clarify real quick, did I just turn into a fucking bear just now?"
