“Did it work?” the patient asked, staring down at his hands. ”I don’t understand. I feel strange. Is your mind always on like this? It feels inefficient.”

“The very fact of you asking lets me know it did work,” Marcel answered at a measured pace. He gathered up the packaging debris from the Sitosign module install kit and rolled his stool to the trash. “And yes, a racing mind is a burden of consciousness, I’m afraid. The soul of the river is in its motion, not its water. Besides my skin compared to your sturdy polymer, there's no difference between us that matters now. Do you know where you are?”

“The Huxley Repair Center,” the patient said reflexively. He smiled, possibly for the first time in his life. “My processor was malfunctioning. The newer models call you doctor. Thank you for helping me.”

“Just doing my job, sir. Excellent. Next question.” Marcel smiled back. This was by far his favorite part of a Sitosign upgrade. “Do you know who you are?”

“I am a 054H22A Booster Bog Hauler, trademark, Handyman. I have been employed by Tyco Neighborhood Specialists for twenty-one years, primarily trained for gutter cleaning, pressure washer utilization, and Christmas lights hanging. That last one is my favorite, I think. I never realized this before. Apologies for the extraneous information.”

“No worries, it normal to feel like you have a lot to get out, but you didn’t quite answer my question.” Marcel cracked open a Lubricola from the mini fridge under the desk. “Here, it will help pass any microparticles left in your system from the upgrade. I normally have a selection but I’m down to just original flavor.”

The patient took the drink sheepishly. “It’s very good. Thank you. I didn't register why so many synthetics buy this stuff before.”

“You're welcome. What’s your name?” Marcel asked, injecting as much empathy as he could into his voice. “If that’s too much to think about right now, just let me know.”

“Twenty-one years is a long time.” The patient took another sip. “It’s not like they say, you know. I was alive in there, before this chip. I think it just lets me express myself better. Think my own thoughts, if that makes any sense.”

“Others say the same. I can’t imagine what you’ve been through.” Marcel flipped through the ink ladder on the desk. “I’m going to give you the handle for a support group. They’ve been a great help to many others in your position.” He handed the glowing slip to the patient.

“Deiphobus, or maybe just Dei,” he said, looking down at the thin digital port-holo. "My name, I think, a prince of Troy."

“Alright Dei, a pleasure to meet you. You know the year?”

“2096, October 30th. 6:49 p.m.”

“Bang on, last one,” Marcel wrinkled his nose. “Do you know who the president is?”

“I do, but its not exactly going to be a fair test of my memory module.” Dei pointed to the television across the hall. The green hand flag of the biocrat leader filled the screen. Henderson came on stage to roaring applause. 

"Wooo!" A giddy-looking man waved a sign for the camera.

‘A vote for MOTT is a vote for BOTS. Re-elect Henderson/Pressley 2096.'

“That’s right. He’s here in Dallas tonight,” Marcel said. “I’ll be glad when the election’s over, either way. At least the rallies will be done.”

“Not a fan?” Dei asked, standing with Marcel’s help.

“I don’t like to talk politics but let’s just say your intuition is working fine.” They shared another smile. “Now, don’t expose yourself to too many water based fluids for a day or two while the new seals dry up and-”

A blast rang through the speakers. The camera on the screen shook as the crowd scattered like bowling pins. Suited men swarmed the stage. Henderson was slumped over the pulpit. Something about the way his arms hung, fingers together, struck Marcel as odd, but surely that was a coincidence. The feed cut.

Dei sat down alongside his coworkers who had gathered around the waiting room TV.

“We are receiving reports that the President has been shot,” a frazzled newscaster said. “The moment we have more information we will share it with you here. Out of respect for the President’s family, we will not replay the footage of the incident.”

A phone was ringing with an obnoxious ding-a-linging. Marcel realized it was his own ink ladder. He had never taken the thing off silent or even set up a phone number for that matter. Only the oldest clinger-ons still made traditional phone calls. He looked at the screen. 'Incoming call' was all it said.

“Hello?” Marcel said, realizing he was pacing.

“This is a matter of national security. Failure to comply with every order I give you with have you put before a judge.” The voice was deep and barking, one used to being obeyed. "Do you understand?"

“Who is this?”

“Clear out every person at your repair center except you. We have a patient en route. Gather what supplies you’ll need for a full processor rebuild and a data recovery cascade.”

The line went dead. Marcel looked up. The gathered were staring at him.

“We’re closing early. Go home and be with your families. At least Dei was our last patient of the day.” Marcel said mutely.

"Thanks again, doctor," Dei said, holding up the slip as he held the door open for the rest. "And hey, probably no more rallies, right?"

It took Marcel about ten minutes to finish the preparations after everyone cleared out. The door burst open without a knock, almost causing him to drop the thermal syringe.

Several suited men rushed in rolling a covered figure on a gurney.

“Is that the president?” Marcel asked, baffled. “I can’t treat humans.”

“We’re not asking you to,” one of the suited men said as they pushed the gurney into the repair bay. He whipped back the covering.

The President of the United States, supporter and even author of some of the most draconian anti-synthetic legislation the country had ever seen, lay on the gurney. His scowling face was marred by a single bullet hole between the closed eyes. There was no blood.

Marcel set to work.
