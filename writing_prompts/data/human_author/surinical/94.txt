“Easy now, you polished twaint. I don’t want to see that hand in the same duchy as your hilt. Keep it high. There you go.”

The flat of the blade rested cold as the stones against Dag’s neck, bits of his stubble shaving off as the stranger breathed in, moving the blade to follow.

“Who are you?” Dag asked. His first day as a royal guard and already he slipped up and let this cutthroat get behind him.

“I’m the one asking questions. Best you learn that real fast,” He sounded northern by his accent, but his breath stank of soured island spice. “Take your belt and unfasten it then kick it forward.”

Dag did as he was told, sending the scabbard, purse and all clanging across the marble. The sword he had sworn before the God Glass only that morning to not release until his death laid scuffed on the hilt.

“You're smarter than the rest,” the stranger hissed and gave him a pat on the head. “We already had to kill two of the others.”

Another man, covered in soot, scurried in front of him, digging through the purse. A wicked smile crossed his face as he came up with the ring of keys.

“One last little thing and you get to scamper away without me giving you a shepherd’s smile. What room is the princess in?”

“I can’t, I won’t tell you. I-” His neck felt wet before the stinging started.

“I’m cutting you now, you dollop of hog lard. I’m gonna keep going deeper and deeper until-”

“Third on the left, past the library,” Dag yelled. “The one with the iron grates on the windows.”

“Shh, little honorless rat,” the stranger said, pulling the knife away and stepping back slowly. “You never saw us. They’ll have your head if you tell what you did.”

The men were gone up the stairs, silent as owls flying. They left his sword.

He hurried to rewrap his belt, putting it on backward first.

“Damn, it all,” he felt his neck, bleeding but closer to a shaving nick than anything. He hurried up the stairs, drawing his blade.

By the time he reached the top, his lungs were burning. It was the armor, twice as thick as his own had been. Why couldn’t he have had a week of practice in it before this? He pushed through the pain and kept running.

He had never seen the door to the princess’s chamber open. It resembled no other door in the castle, twice as thick at least. And all that defense amounts to what when one craven guard gives up the key? He would reclaim his honor, see these scoundrels gutted like the Night of Stars pheasant.

The princess’s chamber was dark, lit by two candles. No, Dag realized, eyeshine gleamed at him from the bed. “Hello,” the young girl said, voice hoarse and unrefined. Did she ever leave her chambers?

“Princess, two foul men have you in their sights. Have you seen them?” Dag yelled, resting an arm on his knee, panting.

“Yes,” she answered as if this were a day-to-day conversation.

“Did they hurt you, steal anything from you? Which way did they go?”

She stood and stepped into the light of the hallway. “They didn’t go anywhere. They’re still here.” She placed a hand on her stomach and smiled wide, mouth red with blood. Her face was crisscrossed with old scars. She was almost as tall as Dag himself. He felt a swirling ball of stress rise in him.

“Princess, you’ve been hurt. You aren’t of your senses. Step out of the room. I’ll protect you.”

In the southern marshes, he had seen the swamp fiends, long and scaled things that growled like bad gears. The princess made the same sound now, croaking rhythmically. She was staring at his neck. He must look gastly to her.

“Why don’t you come inside and protect me?” she asked, stepping back again to the darkness, eyes glowing.

He stepped forward.

“Knight!” Stop!” a commanding voice bellowed. Another Royal Guard sprinted towards them.

“There are two villains about, they may-” Dag started.

The guard slammed the door to the princess's chamber closed, mumbling prayers to himself. “Thank the opalescence.”

“You aren’t hearing me. There are two men after the princess. They may be in there with her. She’s hurt!”

The fellow knight ignored him, using his key to lock the five seals on the door.

“What are you doing!”

“The princess isn’t hurt, she can’t be hurt. Any who enter that room will be, you included.” The knight caught his breath and stepped away, eyeing the door as he did so.

“But, our duty, we must protect her,” Dag said.

“That’s what we tell the hawkers and the gossips. Your real job isn’t to protect the princess from the horrors of the realm. It’s to protect the realm from the horrors of her.”

The croaking came again, slower now, alongside scratching at the door. “Please come protect me, my Knight.”

“Ignore her,” the knight said, “and why is your belt inside out?”
